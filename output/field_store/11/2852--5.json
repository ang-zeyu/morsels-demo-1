It is very possible that Cook, during  this year, rendered assistance to Captains Debbieg and Bassett,  engineers, who were engaged in surveying important points and harbours  with a view to fortification, and Pallisser had been instructed to give  them every help. There is no positive record that Cook did assist, but  his ship was several times engaged near where they were at work, and it  seems very reasonable to suppose that he worked with them, especially as  such work might be very important to both parties.    Cook returned to Spithead on 30th November, and from thence to Deptford  for the winter, and in February obtained permission from the Admiralty to  publish the charts he had completed; Captain Pallisser, who made the  application, said he was of opinion that they \"would be of great  encouragement to new adventurers on the fisheries upon those coasts.\"    ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.    He again left Deptford on 20th April 1766, and arrived at Bon Bon Bay,  1st June, to survey the south-west and south coasts. At the Burgeo  Islands, near Cape Ray, which were reached on 24th July, Cook was able to  take an observation of an eclipse of the sun occurring on 5th August. On  his return to England at the end of the year, he handed the results of  his observations to Dr. Bevis, a prominent Fellow of the Royal Society,  who communicated them to that body on 30th April 1767, and the account is  to be found in the Philosophical Transactions of that year. Dr. Bevis  describes Cook as \"a good mathematician, and very expert at his  business,\" and says he was supplied with very good instruments; that  there were three observers \"with good telescopes, who all agreed as to  the moment of beginning and ending\"; that he had shown Cook's results to  Mr. George Mitchell, who had calculated therefrom the difference of  longitude between the Burgeo Islands and Oxford, where another good  observation had been taken.    Cook makes no reference to the eclipse in the log of the Grenville, but  it appears that he was peculiarly lucky in the weather, for the five days  preceding are described as \"foggy,\" and the four or five succeeding are  \"raining with squalls.\" This observation was a most fortunate one for  Cook, as it brought him to the favourable notice of the Royal Society, a  body of eminent men, outside his own profession, which was able, soon  after, to advance his interests, and in course of time to admit him into  its own ranks as an ornament of which it is still proud.    On 4th November the Grenville left St. John's for winter quarters at  Deptford, and the log ends on 24th November, \"Dungeness light North-East  by East 2 miles.\" Mr. Parker, his assistant, was promoted to a  lieutenancy, and Mr. Michael Lane, who was mentioned for the post by  Captain Graves in 1763, and who was now schoolmaster on the Guernsey, was  appointed in his place.    On 5th April 1767 the Grenville had completed her refit, warped out of  dock, and was at anchor waiting for the tide to turn in order to drop  down to Woolwich, when the Three Sisters, a Sunderland collier, Thomas  Boyd, Master, \"fell athwart her hawse and carried away her bowsprit, cap,  and jibboom,\" which had to be replaced. The story is that this accident  happened to the Endeavour, and that Mr. Cook, who was naturally very  indignant, sent for the offending Master of the collier to give him a  sound rating for running foul of one of His Majesty's ships; but when he  found himself face to face with an old schoolfellow of the Ayton days, he  took him down into his cabin, treated him to the best he had on board,  and spent a good time with him talking over the old days when they were  boys together. From Cook's character the story may well be true,  excepting it has been applied to the wrong ship.    When the repairs were executed the Grenville sailed for Newfoundland,  arriving off Cape Race on 9th May, and Cook at once set to work on the  survey of the west coast. He landed in September at the mouth of the  Humber, and made a rapid examination of that river, discovering several  lakes, and getting a good general idea of that part of the island. He  returned to St. John's for the last time on 14th October, having  practically completed the survey of the general run of the coast, and  added very considerably to the knowledge of some of the interior parts of  the island. In 1762 a map was published, compiled from the very latest  information, and on it is the note: \"The inland parts of this island are  entirely unknown.\" Cook is said to have discovered valuable seams of  coal, but there is no note of anything of the kind amongst his records.    THE GRENVILLE ASHORE.    He sailed for England on 23rd October, and anchored off the Nore in very  heavy weather on 11th November. It was soon found that the anchors would  not hold, and at length one parted and the ship \"trailed into shallow  water, striking hard.\" After a while she again struck heavily, and \"lay  down on her larboard bilge.\" As there seemed no prospect of the gale  moderating, everything was made as snug as time would allow, and, putting  his crew into the boats, Cook made for Sheerness. The weather at length  improved, so obtaining assistance he returned and found that fortunately  his ship had sustained very little damage, and the next day he  successfully floated her, and got her up to Deptford yards on the  following Sunday, and then Cook was able to set to work on his charts. On  3rd February, Pallisser wrote to Mr. Stephens asking him to obtain  permission from the Lords to publish, and at once obtained the necessary  authority.    Some of these charts had been published in 1766, and now the complete  series appeared with sailing directions for the south and east coasts of  the islands. Admiral Sir W.J.L. Wharton, the late hydrographer to the  Admiralty, says:    \"The Charts he made during these years in the schooner Grenville were  admirable. The best proof of their excellence is that they are not yet  wholly superseded by the more detailed surveys of modern times. Like all  first surveys of a practically unknown shore, and especially when that  shore abounds in rocks and shoals, and is much indented with bays and  creeks, they are imperfect in the sense of having many omissions; but  when the amount of the ground covered, and the impediments of fogs and  bad weather on that coast is considered, and that Cook had at the most  only one assistant, their accuracy is truly astonishing.\"    On the publication of his charts, Cook's connection with Newfoundland was  concluded, and on 12th April 1768 Mr. Lane was \"appointed to act as  Master of the brig Grenville, and surveyor of the coasts of Newfoundland  and Labrador in the absence of Mr. Cook, who is to be employed  elsewhere.\" Mr. Lane was to be paid an allowance of five shillings per  day over and above his pay as Master of a sixth rate. Cook and he were  paid their allowances up to 31st December 1767, and on 17th June the Navy  Board were ordered to complete Cook's allowance up to 12th April. From  the wording of Mr. Lane's appointment it would appear that the surveyor's  position was to be left open for Cook if it was thought desirable for him  to resume it.      CHAPTER 6. 1768. PREPARATIONS FOR FIRST VOYAGE.    Till a few years ago writers on the subject were content to draw their  information as to the first voyage of Cook to the South Seas from the  so-called history of Dr. Hawkesworth. This gentleman, who posed as a  stylist (Boswell calls him a \"studious imitator of Dr. Johnson\"), was  introduced by Dr. Charles Burney to Lord Sandwich for the express purpose  of writing an account of the expedition, and was supplied with all the  records in the possession of the Admiralty relating to it, he had access  to the Journal of Sir Joseph Banks, the Notes of Dr. Solander and others  who accompanied Cook, and, more than all, he had the opportunity of  personal communication with the leaders of the party. Notwithstanding  these advantages he interpolated so much of his own speculations,  conclusions, and dissertations, as to render his voluminous work not only  extremely unreliable but often extremely ridiculous. Travellers to the  South Seas record that the accounts of things and places described as  seen by Cook are remarkably correct, but that the inferences drawn are  wrong. They do not realise that the statements of fact are Cook's, whilst  the deductions and ornamentations are Hawkesworth's, and were strongly  resented by Cook. Boswell relates that he told Johnson that he had met  Captain Cook at dinner at Sir John Pringle's (then President of the Royal  Society), and gave him an account of a conversation they had together.  Johnson:    \"was much pleased with the conscientious accuracy of that celebrated  circumnavigator, who set me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts  given by Dr. Hawkesworth of his voyages.\"    Cook's opinion on the subject may be seen from his determination to  prepare his Journals for the press himself in the future.    Within the last few years the Journal of the Endeavour has been published  under the able supervision of the late Admiral Sir W.J.L. Wharton, and  the Journal of Sir Joseph Banks, which was missing for a long time, has  been recovered and published by Sir Joseph Hooker; and these two books  may be preferred with safety over all others that have been written on  the subject.    MEMORIAL TO THE KING.    It had been calculated that a Transit of Venus would occur in 1769,  observations of which would be of great importance to astronomical  science, and several of the European nations, notably Russia, were  intending to establish points of observation. The Royal Society decided  that as England had hitherto taken a lead in astronomy, she should not  now fall behind, and appointed a committee to report on the places where  it would be desirable to take observations, the methods to be pursued,  and the persons"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#11)"],[1,".2

[Footnote 1: First choices correct by reason of aid from the experimenter  are not counted as correct (R) in the summary.]    [Footnote *: Aided by experimenter.]      The method of choosing the first box at the right end and then the one  next to it developed in the case of all except two of the ten settings.  The time of appearance is worth noting. In setting 1, it failed to  appear; in setting 2, it developed early,--after about one hundred  trials; in setting 3, after about one hundred and fifty trials; in  setting 4, after about one hundred and fifty trials; in setting 5, after  about one hundred and seventy trials; in setting 6, after about one  hundred trials; in setting 7, after about fifty trials; in setting 8, it  never developed; in setting 9, after about fifty trials; and in setting  10, it developed very late,--after about four hundred and seventy  trials.    This method of reaction, although inadequate, proved remarkably  persistent, and it is doubtful whether it had been wholly overcome at  the conclusion of the experiment. In the case of the series of trials  given on June 8, numbered 191 to 200, the method used was either that of  the first at the right and then the next, or direct choice of the right  box.    Throughout the trials with this problem, the end boxes, numbers 1 and 9,  were avoided. This is at least partially explained by the fact that they  never existed, and obviously never could appear, in problem 2, as right  boxes. In trials 601 to 610, given on July 7, there occurred partial  "]]]
