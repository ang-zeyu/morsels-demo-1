Why do you treat the weightiest matters as if  you were playing a game of dice? For it is one thing to lay up bread and  wine as in a storehouse, and another thing to eat. That which has been  eaten, is digested, distributed, and is become sinews, flesh, bones,  blood, healthy color, healthy breath. Whatever is stored up, when you  choose you can readily take and show it; but you have no other advantage  from it except so far as to appear to possess it. For what is the  difference between explaining these doctrines and those of men who have  different opinions? Sit down now and explain according to the rules of  art the opinions of Epicurus, and perhaps you will explain his opinions  in a more useful manner than Epicurus himself. Why then do you call  yourself a Stoic? Why do you deceive the many? Why do you act the part  of a Jew, when you are a Greek? Do you not see how (why) each is called  a Jew, or a Syrian, or an Egyptian? and when we see a man inclining to  two sides, we are accustomed to say, This man is not a Jew, but he acts  as one. But when he has assumed the affects of one who has been imbued  with Jewish doctrine and has adopted that sect, then he is in fact and  he is named a Jew.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE MAY DISCOVER THE DUTIES OF LIFE FROM NAMES.--Consider who you  are. In the first place, you are a man; and this is one who has nothing  superior to the faculty of the will, but all other things subjected to  it; and the faculty itself he possesses unenslaved and free from  subjection. Consider then from what things you have been separated by  reason. You have been separated from wild beasts; you have been  separated from domestic animals ([Greek: probaton]). Further, you are a  citizen of the world, and a part of it, not one of the subservient  (serving), but one of the principal (ruling) parts, for you are capable  of comprehending the divine administration and of considering the  connection of things. What then does the character of a citizen promise  (profess)? To hold nothing as profitable to himself; to deliberate about  nothing as if he were detached from the community, but to act as the  hand or foot would do, if they had reason and understood the  constitution of nature, for they would never put themselves in motion  nor desire anything otherwise than with reference to the whole.  Therefore, the philosophers say well, that if the good man had  foreknowledge of what would happen, he would co-operate towards his own  sickness and death and mutilation, since he knows that these things are  assigned to him according to the universal arrangement, and that the  whole is superior to the part, and the state to the citizen. But now  because we do not know the future, it is our duty to stick to the things  which are in their nature more suitable for our choice, for we were made  among other things for this.    After this, remember that you are a son. What does this character  promise? To consider that everything which is the son's belongs to the  father, to obey him in all things, never to blame him to another, nor to  say or do anything which does him injury, to yield to him in all things  and give way, co-operating with him as far as you can. After this know  that you are a brother also, and that to this character it is due to  make concessions; to be easily persuaded, to speak good of your brother,  never to claim in opposition to him any of the things which are  independent of the will, but readily to give them up, that you may have  the larger share in what is dependent on the will. For see what a thing  it is, in place of a lettuce, if it should so happen, or a seat, to gain  for yourself goodness of disposition. How great is the advantage.    Next to this, if you are a senator of any state, remember that you are a  senator; if a youth, that you are a youth; if an old man, that you are  an old man; for each of such names, if it comes to be examined, marks  out the proper duties. But if you go and blame your brother, I say to  you, You have forgotten who you are and what is your name. In the next  place, if you were a smith and made a wrong use of the hammer, you would  have forgotten the smith; and if you have forgotten the brother and  instead of a brother have become an enemy, would you appear not to have  changed one thing for another in that case? And if instead of a man, who  is a tame animal and social, you are become a mischievous wild beast,  treacherous, and biting, have you lost nothing? But (I suppose) you must  lose a bit of money that you may suffer damage? And does the loss of  nothing else do a man damage? If you had lost the art of grammar or  music, would you think the loss of it a damage? and if you shall lose  modesty, moderation ([Greek: chtastolaen]) and gentleness, do you think  the loss nothing? And yet the things first mentioned are lost by some  cause external and independent of the will, and the second by our own  fault; and as to the first neither to have them nor to lose them is  shameful; but as to the second, not to have them and to lose them is  shameful and matter of reproach and a misfortune.    What then? shall I not hurt him who has hurt me? In the first place  consider what hurt ([Greek: blabae]) is, and remember what you have  heard from the philosophers. For if the good consists in the will  (purpose, intention, [Greek: proaireeis]), and the evil also in the  will, see if what you say is not this: What then, since that man has  hurt himself by doing an unjust act to me, shall I not hurt myself by  doing some unjust act to him? Why do we not imagine to ourselves  (mentally think of) something of this kind? But where there is any  detriment to the body or to our possession, there is harm there; and  where the same thing happens to the faculty of the will, there is (you  suppose) no harm; for he who has been deceived or he who has done an  unjust act neither suffers in the head nor in the eye nor in the hip,  nor does he lose his estate; and we wish for nothing else than (security  to) these things. But whether we shall have the will modest and faithful  or shameless and faithless, we care not the least, except only in the  school so far as a few words are concerned. Therefore our proficiency is  limited to these few words; but beyond them it does not exist even in  the slightest degree.           *       *       *       *       *    WHAT THE BEGINNING OF PHILOSOPHY IS.--The beginning of philosophy, to  him at least who enters on it in the right way and by the door is a  consciousness of his own weakness and inability about necessary things;  for we come into the world with no natural notion of a right-angled  triangle, or of a diesis (a quarter tone), or of a half-tone; but we  learn each of these things by a certain transmission according to art;  and for this reason those who do not know them do not think that they  know them. But as to good and evil, and beautiful and ugly, and becoming  and unbecoming, and happiness and misfortune, and proper and improper,  and what we ought to do and what we ought not to do, who ever came into  the world without having an innate idea of them? Wherefore we all use  these names, and we endeavor to fit the preconceptions to the several  cases (things) thus: he has done well; he has not done well; he has done  as he ought, not as he ought; he has been unfortunate, he has been  fortunate; he is unjust, he is just; who does not use these names? who  among us defers the use of them till he has learned them, as he defers  the use of the words about lines (geometrical figures) or sounds? And  the cause of this is that we come into the world already taught as it  were by nature some things on this matter ([Greek: topon]), and  proceeding from these we have added to them self-conceit ([Greek:  oiaesin]). For why, a man says, do I not know the beautiful and the  ugly? Have I not the notion of it? You have. Do I not adapt it to  particulars? You do. Do I not then adapt it properly? In that lies the  whole question; and conceit is added here; for beginning from these  things which are admitted men proceed to that which is matter of dispute  by means of unsuitable adaptation; for if they possessed this power of  adaptation in addition to those things, what would hinder them from  being perfect? But now since you think that you properly adapt the  preconceptions to the particulars, tell me whence you derive this  (assume that you do so). Because I think so. But it does not seem so to  another, and he thinks that he also makes a proper adaptation; or does  he not think so? He does think so. Is it possible then that both of you  can properly apply the preconceptions to things about which you have  contrary opinions? It is not possible. Can you then show us anything  better towards adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking that you  do? Does the madman do any other things than the things which seem to  him right? Is then this criterion sufficient for him also? It is not  sufficient. Come then to something which is superior to seeming ([Greek:  tou dochein]). What is this?    Observe, this is the beginning of philosophy, a perception of the  disagreement of men with one another, and an inquiry into the cause of  the disagreement, and a condemnation and distrust of that which only  \"seems,\" and a certain investigation of that which \"seems\" whether it  \"seems\" rightly, and a discovery of some rule ([Greek: chanonos]), as we  have discovered a balance in the determination of weights, and a  carpenter's rule (or square) in the case of straight and crooked  things.--This is the beginning of philosophy. Must we say that all  things are right which seem so to all? And how is it possible that  contradictions can be right?--Not all then, but all which seem to us to  be right.--How more to you than those which seem right to the Syrians?  why more than what seem right "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#11)"],[1,"of wicked and false  messages by those evil things of the Night Land. And it told to us, as I  have made remark, how that those Monsters and Forces had a full  awaredness of the speech between the Pyramids; yet could they have no  power to say the Master-Word; so had we some test left, and a way to  sure knowledge of what made talk in the night.    And all that I have told should bring to those of this Age something of  the yet unbegotten terror of that; and a quiet and sound thankfulness to  God, that we suffer not as humanity shall yet suffer.    But, for all this, let it not be thought that they of that Age accounted  it as suffering; but as no more than the usual of human existence. And  by this may we know that we can meet all circumstances, and use  ourselves to them and live through them wisely, if we be but prudent and  consider means of invention.    And through all the Night Land there was an extraordinary awakening  among the Monsters and Forces; so that the instruments made constant  note of greater powers at work out there in the darkness; and the  Monstruwacans were busied recording, and keeping a very strict watch.  And so was there at all that time a sense of difference and awakening,  and of wonders about, and to come.    And from The Country Whence Comes The Great Laughter, the Laughter  sounded constant ... as it were an uncomfortable and heart-shaking  voice-thunder rolling thence over the Lands, out from the unknown East.  And the Pit of the Red Smoke filled all the Deep Valley with redness, so  that the smoke rose above the edge, and hid the bases of the Towers upon  the far side.    And the Giants could be seen plentiful around the Kilns to the East; and  from the Kilns great belches of fire; though the meaning of it, as of  all else, we could not say; but only the cause.    And from the Mountain Of The Voice, which rose to the South-East of the  South-East Watcher, and of which I have made no telling hitherto, in  this faulty setting-out, I heard for the first time in that life, the  calling of the Voice. And though the Records made mention of it; yet not  often was it heard. And the calling was shrill, and very peculiar and  distressful and horrible; as though a giant-woman, hungering strangely,  shouted unknown words across the night. And this was how it seemed to  me; and many thought this to describe the sound.    And, by all this, may you perceive how that Land was awakened.    And other tricks there were to entice us into the Night Land; and once a  call came thrilling in the aether, and told to us that certain humans  had escaped from the Lesser Redoubt, and drew nigh to us; but were faint  for food, and craved succour. Yet, when we sent the Master-Word into the  night, the creatures without could make no reply; which was a very happy  thing for our souls; for we had been all mightily exercised in our  hearts by this one message; and now had proof that it was but a trap.    And constantly, and at all hours, I would have speech with Naani of the  Lesser Redoubt; for I had taught her how she might send her thoughts  through the night, with her brain-elements; but not to over-use this  power; for it exhausts the body and the powers of the mind, if it be  abused by exceeding usage.    Yet, despite that I had taught her the use of her brain-elements, she  sent her message always without strength, save when she had use of the  instrument; and this I set to the cause that she had not the health  force needful; but, apart from this, she had the Night-Hearing very  keen; though less than mine.    And so, with many times of speech, and constant tellings of our doings  and thoughts, we drew near in the spirit to one another; and had always  a feeling in our hearts that we had been given previous acquaintance.    And this, as may be thought, thrilled my heart very strangely.          IV    THE HUSHING OF THE VOICE          (\"Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--          Treading, as moon-flakes step across a dark--        Kissing the very dew to holier light ...          Thy Voice a song past mountains, which to hark        Frightens my soul with an utter lost delight.\")    Now, one night, towards the end of the sixteenth hour, as I made ready  to sleep, there came all about me the thrilling of the aether, as  happened oft in those days; but the thrilling had a strange power in it;  and in my soul the voice of Naani sounded plain, all within and about  me.    Yet, though I knew it to be the voice of Naani, I answered not  immediately; save to send the sure question of the Master-Word into the  night. And, directly, I heard the answer, the Master-Word beating  steadily in the night; and I questioned Naani why she had speech with me  by the Instrument at that time, when all were sleeping, and the watch  set among the Monstruwacans; for they in the little Pyramid had their  sleep-time to commence at the eleventh hour; so that by this it was five  hours advanced towards the time of waking; and Naani should have slept;  nor have been abroad to the Tower of Observation, apart from her father.  For I supposed that she spoke by the Instrument, her voice sounding very  clear in my brain. Yet, to this question, she made no answer in kind;  but gave a certain thing into my spirit, which set me trembling; for she  said certain words, that began:    \"Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--\"    And it well may be that she set me to tremble; for as the words grew  about me, there wakened a memory-dream how that I had made these same  words to Mirdath the Beautiful in the long-gone Eternity of this our  Age, when she had died and left me alone in all the world. And I was  weak a little with the tumult and force of my emotion; but in a moment I  called eagerly with my brain-elements to Naani to give some explaining  of this thing that she had spoken to the utter troubling of my heart.    Yet, once more she made no direct answer; but spoke the words again to  me across all the dark of the world. And it came to me suddenly, that it  was not Naani that spoke; but Mirdath the Beautiful, from out of all the  everlasting night. And I called: \"Mirdath! Mirdath,\" with my  brain-elements, into the night; and lo! the far, faint voice spoke again  to my spirit through all the darkness of eternity, saying again those  words. Yet, though the voice was the voice of Mirdath the Beautiful, it  was also the voice of Naani; and I knew in all my heart that this thing  was in verity; and that it had been given to me to be birthed once more  into this world in the living-time of that Only One, with whom my spirit  and essence hath mated in all ages through the everlasting. And I called  with my brain-elements and all my strength to Naani; but there came no  answer; neither sign of hearing, though through hours I called.    And thus at last I came to an utter exhaustion; but neither could be  quiet, nor sleep. Yet, presently, I slept.    And when I waked, my first memory was of the wondrous thing which had  befallen in the sleep-time; for none in all this world could have known  those words; save it had been the spirit of Mirdath, my Beautiful One,  looking from above my shoulder in that utter-lost time, as I made those  words to her, out of an aching and a broken heart. And the voice had  been the voice of Mirdath; and the voice of Mirdath had been the voice  of Naani. And what shall any say to this, save that which I had in my  heart.    And immediately I called to Naani, once, and again twice; and in a  little moment there came all about me the throbbing of the Master-Word,  beating solemnly in the night; and I sent the Master-Word to give  assurance, and immediately the voice of Naani, a little weak as was it  always when she had not the Instrument, but sent the message with her  brain-elements.    And I answered her, and questioned her eagerly concerning her sayings of  the past time of sleep; but she disclaimed, and made clear to me that  she had no knowledge of having spoken; but had slept through all that  time of which I made to tell; and, indeed, had dreamed a very strange  dream.    And for a little while I was confused, and meditated, not knowing what  to think; but came suddenly again to a knowledge that Naani's far voice  was thrilling the aether all about; and that she would tell to me her  dream; which had set strong upon her mind.    And she told the dream to me, and in the dream she had seen a tall, dark  man, built very big, and dressed in unfamiliar clothing. And the man had  been in a little room, and very sorrowful, and lonesome; and in her  dream she had gone nigh to him.    And presently the man made to write, that he might ease him by giving  expression to his sorrow; and Naani had been able to read the words that  he wrote; though to her waking spirit the language in which they were  writ was strange and unknown. Yet she could not remember what he had  writ, save but one short line, and this she had mind of in that he had  writ the word Mirdath above. And she spoke of the strangeness of this  thing, that she should dream of this name; but supposed that I had fixed  it upon her, by my first callings.    And then did I, with something of a tremble in my spirit, ask Naani to  tell me what she remembered of the writing of that big, sorrowful  stranger. And, in a little moment, her far voice said these words all  about me:        \"Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--\"    But no more had she memory of. Yet it was a sufficiency, and I, maybe  with a mad, strange triumph in my soul, said unto her with my  brain-elements that which remained of those words. And my spirit felt  them strike upon the spirit of Naani, and awake her memory, as with the  violence of a blow. And for a little while she stumbled, dumb before so  much newness and certainly. And her spirit then to waken, and she near  wept with the fright and the sudden, new wonder of this thing.    And"]]]
