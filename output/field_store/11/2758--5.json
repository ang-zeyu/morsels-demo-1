Communicating with this island and another, he finally left on February  3rd, 1778, and on March 7th made the coast of North America, a little  south of the Columbia River. Gales ensued, and Cook missed the entrance  of Juan de Fuca Strait, making the land again a little north of it.    Anchoring first in Nootka Sound in Vancouver Island--though Cook did not  know it was an island--the ships continued their exploration to the  north-west, skirting the coast as near as stormy weather permitted them,  and calling at various places until the north-west extremity of the  Alaska Peninsula was reached. In one place, afterwards called Cook's  River, it was hoped that the desired passage eastward was found; but it  was soon discovered that it was merely an inlet.    Passing through the Aleutian Chain, east of Unalaska, Cook visited that  island, and continued his voyage through the Bering Sea, clinging to the  land as much as possible, and finally got into Bering Strait. Here he had  both continents in sight, and communicated with both sides.    Standing further north, he, in latitude 70 degrees 30 minutes north, came  across the icy barrier of the Arctic Sea. After vainly trying for a  passage in fog and strong wind, surrounded by loose ice, and after  mapping a good deal of the shores on both sides, the ships again turned  south at the end of August, exploring as they went first on the Asiatic  side, and afterwards on the American, especially examining Norton Sound.  In the beginning of October they once more arrived at Unalaska, and the  Resolution having sprung a dangerous leak, the opportunity was taken to  stop it.    On October 26th the ships sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where Cook had  determined to winter, for the double purpose of refreshing his crew,  gaining more knowledge of the Group, and being in a convenient position  for resuming his exploration in the spring.    The voyage just accomplished was very remarkable, whether for the amount  of coast mapped, which extended for between three and four thousand  miles, or for the determination with which it was prosecuted in  tempestuous and thick weather, on a most dangerous and inhospitable  coast, part of the time in ice. The crews were perfectly healthy, with no  sign of scurvy, and he brought both his ships off without any damage.    Maui, another of the Sandwich Group, was made on November 26th, and after  communicating, the ships stood over to Owhyhee (Hawaii). Wind was against  them, and it was not until January 17th that the two ships, having passed  along the north side of the island to the eastward, at last anchored in  Kealakekua Bay, on the south-west side.    The events which followed the arrival of the ships at Hawaii, which  terminated in Captain Cook's death, were not understood at the time, but  have been elucidated by the inquiries of the early missionaries, which  throw much light upon the beliefs of the islanders.    It appears that a tradition existed that a chief of earlier times, one  Rono, Orono, or Lono (the R and the L in the Pacific languages are almost  interchangeable), had, after killing his wife, become frantically insane,  and after travelling through the islands boxing and wrestling with all he  met, had departed in a canoe, prophesying that he would some day return  in an island with trees, hogs, and dogs. He was deified, and temples  erected in his honour.    When Cook's ships arrived it was believed that the prophecy was  fulfilled. Rono had returned as he had said, and the natives flocked to  do him honour. When Cook landed he was received with adoration, the  crowds prostrating themselves, and the priests escorting him with much  ceremony. Led to a temple, he was clothed with red cloth, had pigs  offered to him, and was generally treated in a manner which, though  satisfactory as showing the friendly feelings of the natives, was  puzzling to the Europeans. This continued throughout their stay, presents  of all kinds being showered upon them. The officers, however, observed  that the warrior chiefs were not so enthusiastic as the priests and  common people. The death of a seaman, who was buried on shore in the  presence of a large concourse, would seem to have been the first  circumstance that threw doubts upon the godlike character of the  visitors; but the ready way in which the fence of a Morai or sacred  inclosure, which included various images, was granted for fuel, shows  that the priests still held to their idea. The king, Taraiopu (or  Terreooboo, as his name was written by Captain King), arrived shortly  after the ships anchored, and showed himself to be as much impressed with  the public belief as any of his subjects.    Thus matters continued during the eighteen days the ships remained; but  towards the end of this time the natives began to show anxiety that they  should be gone. The drain of hogs and other provisions, which were poured  upon the visitors, doubtless led to anxious thoughts as to how long this  was to last; and probably those members of the community who were less  amenable to the influence of the priests, and were jealous of their own  authority, were by no means so certain that the popular opinion of the  supernatural nature of the white men was correct.    The ships sailed on February 4th, but, as ill-luck had it, the Resolution  sprung her foremast in a gale, and Cook resolved to return to Kealakekua  Bay for repairs. Here they again anchored on the 11th.    Their reception was, however, very different.    No crowd of canoes round the ship; no enthusiastic mass of natives on  shore. Everything was silence.    What had happened was that the king had departed, leaving the bay under  \"tabu,\" i.e., a sacred interdict.    The priests, however, received them with as much friendliness as before,  and the Morai was given up to them as a place of repairs for the damaged  mast.    The king hurried back on hearing of the return of the ships, and removed  the tabu; but the native disposition was changed. Some of the party on  shore had persuaded women to break the tabu.    Whether this affected relations is uncertain, but the inhabitants  generally exhibited considerable hostility, and headed by some chiefs,  showed an inclination to attack a watering party. Thefts followed, and  the capture of a canoe as a reprisal caused a scuffle on the beach, in  which the Englishmen were worsted by the crowd, though a friendly chief  soon restored order.    Instructions were now given to the party on shore at the Morai to permit  no natives to approach in the night, and a musket was fired at one of  them who came near.    On the morning of February 14th the Discovery's cutter was found to have  been stolen.    Cook at once decided to have recourse to his usual practice, and get  either the king or some principal chief on board, as a hostage till it  was returned. He at the same time gave orders to prevent any canoes from  leaving the bay, in order that he might, if necessary, seize them, and  sent his boats to carry this out. Guns were fired from the ships at two  large canoes that attempted to pass. Cook himself landed with a small  armed force, and went in search of the king, who at once consented to  come on board. The conduct of Taraiopu throughout showed that he had  perfect confidence in Cook, and was entirely friendly, whether he still  believed in the Rono theory or not.    While walking down to the boat, the natives, who were momentarily  increasing in numbers, implored the king not to go. His wife joined her  entreaties. Taraiopu hesitated. At this moment a man ran up and cried,  \"It is war; they have killed a chief!\" One of the guard boats had, in  fact, fired at a canoe attempting to leave the bay, and killed a man. The  natives at once ran to arms, and Cook, seeing his intentions frustrated,  walked towards the boat. A native attacked him with a spear, and Cook  shot him with his gun. Still, no further attack was made, but the men in  the boats hearing Cook's shot, and seeing the excited crowd, commenced to  fire without orders. Cook still moved to the shore, calling to his men to  cease firing; but whilst so doing, and with his back to the exasperated  natives, he was stabbed in the back with a dagger, and fell with his face  in the water.    There was then general confusion. The boats were a little way from the  beach, and several of the marines were also killed, before they could  reach them. Cook's body was at once dragged off by the natives.    The boats returned on board amid general consternation, and it is  mentioned that a general silence reigned on board when it was known that  their beloved commander had fallen.    The party at the Morai were shortly after attacked, but beat off the  assailants, and reinforcements were sent from the ships. Lieutenant King,  a favourite officer of Cook's, behaved with great discretion, and  assisted by some of the priests, made a truce, during which the mast and  other articles on shore for repairs were got off.    The sailors were mad for reprisals, but Captain Clerke, on whom the  command devolved, decided on pacific measures, and every attempt was made  to recover Cook's body. All that was obtained, however, were some of his  bones, which were brought down with much solemnity by a chief, and  delivered wrapped up in new cloth and red feathers.    It was known in after years that Cook's body had been instantly cut up;  the flesh was burnt, as was the custom with great chiefs and many of the  bones were preserved with great honour in a Morai dedicated to Rono.    It seems clear that Cook's death was due to a revulsion of feeling on the  part of some of the natives, who no longer believed in his divine  character, but that many regarded the outrage with horror. When the first  Europeans came to reside on the island, and learnt the story from the  native side, they found universal regret prevailing at this untoward  occurrence.

The sea that lieth on the  Northe parte, is called Libicum, that on the Southe Aethiopicum, and the  other on the West Atlanticum.    At the first the whole was possest by fower sondrie peoples. Of the whiche,  twaine (as Herodotus writeth) ware founde there, tyme out of minde, and the  other twaine ware alienes and incommes. The two of continuance, ware the  Poeni, and Ethiopes, whiche dwelte, the one at the Northe of the lande, the  other at the South. The Alienes, the Phoenices, the Grekes, the old  Ethiopians, and the Aegipcienes, if it be true that thei report of  themselues. At the beginnyng thei were sterne, and vnruly, and bruteshely  liued, with herbes and with fleshe of wilde beastes, without lawe or rule,  or facion of life, roilyng and rowmyng vpon heade, heather and thether  without place of abode, where night came vpon them, there laiyng their  bodies to reste. Afterwarde (as thei saie) Hercules passyng the seas out of  Spaine, into Libie (a countrie on the Northe shore of Afrike) and bringyng  an ouerplus of people thence with hym, somewhat bettre facioned and manered  then thei, trained them to muche more humanitie. And of the troughes  [Footnote: Ships.] thei came ouer in, made themselues cotages, and began to  plante in plompes [Footnote: Clumps, bodies.] one by another. But of these  thinges we shall speake here aftre more at large.    Afrike is not euery place a like enhabited. For toward the Southe it lieth  for the moste part waste, and vnpeopled, for the broilyng heate of that  quatre. But the part that lieth ouer against Europe, is verie well  enhabited. The frutefulnesse of the soile is excedyng, and to muche  merueillous: as in some places bringyng the siede with a hundred folde  encrease. It is straunge to beleue, that is saied of the goodnesse of the  soile of the Moores. The stocke of their vines to be more then two menne  can fadome, and their clousters of Grapes to be a cubite long. The  coronettes of their Pasnepes, and Gardein Thistles (whiche we calle  Hortichokes) as also of their Fenelle, to be twelue Cubites compasse. Their  haue Cannes like vnto those of India, whiche may contein in the compasse of  the knot, or iointe, the measure of ij. bushelles. Ther be sene also  Sparagi, of no lesse notable bigguenesse. Toward the mounte Atlas trees bee  founde of a wondrefull heigth, smothe, and without knaggue or knotte, vp to  the hard toppe, hauyng leaues like the Cypres, but of all other the moste  noble Citrus, wherof the Romaines made great deintie.

There  are Elephantes, Lyons, Bugles, Pardales, Roes, and Apes, in some places  beyonde nombre. There are also Chamelopardales and Rhizes, like vnto  Bulles. Herodote writeth, that there be founde Asses with hornes, Hienas  Porpentines, wilde Rambes, a beast engendered of the Hiene and the Woulfe  named Thoas, Pantheres, Storckes, Oistruthes, and many kindes of serpentes,  as Cerastes, and Aspides, against whom nature hath matched the Ichneumon (a  verie little beast) as a mortall enemie.      ¶ The. iiij.

The one whiche at this daie  is called Inde, hath on the east the redde sea, and the sea named  Barbaricum, on the northe it toucheth vpon Egypte, and vpon that Libie that  standeth on the vtter border of Afrike toward the sea. On the west it is  bounded with the other Libie that standeth more into the mayne londe. The  residue that runneth toward the south, ioyneth vpon the netherland Ethiope,  whiche lyeth more southerly, and is muche greater. It is thought that these  Ethiopes toke name of Ethiopus Vulcanes sonne, that (as Plinie saieth) was  gouernour there. Or els of the Greke wordes aythoo and ops, whereof the  former signifieth to broyle, or to bourne vp with heate, and the other, in  the eye or sight. Whiche sheweth in effecte, that the countreie lyeng in  the eye of the Sonne, it must nedes be of heate almost importable. As in  diede it lyeth in the full course of the sonne, and is in continuall heate.  Toward the weast it is hilly, in the middes grauell and sande, and on the  easte waste and deserte. There be in it dyuers peoples of sondry phisonomy  and shape, monstruous and of hugly shewe. They are thought (as I saied) to  haue bene the fyrst of all men, and those whiche of all other maye  truelyest be called an homeborne people. Neuer vnder the bondage of any:  but euer a free nacion. The first wae of worshippyng God (say thei) was  deuised and taught emonge theim: with the maners and ceremonies there to  appertinent. They had two kyndes of letters, one, whiche ware knowen onely  to their priestes for matters of Religion, whiche they called misticall,  and another for the vse of the people hidden from none. Yeat ware not their  Letters facioned to ioyne together in sillables like ours, but Ziphres, and  shapes of men and of beastes, of heades, and of armes, and artificers  tooles, which signified in sondrie wise echone accordyng to his propertie.  As by the picture of an hauke swiftenes and spiede, by the shape of a  crocodile [Transcriber's note: 'crocoiled' in original] displeasure or  misfortune, by the figure of an eye, good watche or regarde, and so forthe  of other. Emong their priestes, loke whome they sawe startle aboute as  haulfe wood, [Footnote: Mad, from the Saxon _wod_. See \"Two Gentlemen of  Verona,\" ii., 3, and \"Mids. N.

This king for al that, must be  gouerned by the lawe, and is bounde to all thinges after thorde of the  contry. He his selfe maye neither punishe or guerdon any manne. But loke  vpon whome he wyl haue execution done, he sendeth the minister appoincted  for the purpose, to the person with a token of deathe: whiche when he hath  shewed, the officier retourneth, and the persone what soeuer he be,  incontinent fordoeth him self. So greatly ware they giuen to thee honour of  their kynges, suche a feruencie had they towarde them, that if it fortuned  the king through any mishap, to be maymed or hurte in any parte of his  bodye, as many as ware towarde him, namely of householde, voluntarily  woulde giue them selues the lyke hurt, thincking it an vnfitting  [Transcriber's note: original 'unsitting'] thing the kynge to lacke an eye  or the vse of a legge, and his frindes neither to halt, ne yet to lacke  parte of their sight.

The  moste part of them, for that they lye so vnder the Sonne, go naked:  couering their priuities with shiepes tayles.

Some make them brieches of the heares of their heades vp to the  waeste. They are comonly brieders and grasiers in commune together. Their  shepe be of very small body, and of a harde and roughe coate. Their dogges  also are neuer a whitte bigger, but thei are fierce and hardie. They haue  good store of gromel and barly, wherof they vse to make drincke. All other  graine and fruictes thei lacke, excepte it be dates whiche also are verye  skante. Some of them lyue with herbes and the tender rootes of cannes or  Riedes. Other eate flesshe, milke, and chese. Meroe, was in time past the  heade citie of the kyngdome, whiche stondeth in an Isle of the same name  facioned like a shielde, stretching it self thre thousand furlong alongest  by Nilus. Aboute that Islande do the cattle masters dwelle, and are muche  giuen to hunting, and those that be occupied with tilthe of the grounde  haue also mines of gold. Herodotus writeth that thethiopians named  Macrobij, do more estieme latten then thei do golde whiche thei put to  nothyng that thei compt of any price. In so muche that the Ambassadours of  Cambises, when thei came thether, found the prisoners in the gaole fettred  and tied with Chaines of golde.

Thei hunte Elephantes and  kyll them to eate. There be Lions, Rhinocerotes, Basiliskes, Pardales, and  Dragones, whiche I said enwrappe thelephauntes, and sucke them to death,  for their bloude. There be found the precious stones called the Iacinthe,  and the Prasne. There is also cinamome gathered. Thei occupie bowes of  woode seasoned in the fire, of foure cubites long.
