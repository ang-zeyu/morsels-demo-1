On the way home the Secretary's wife said, 'I do hope that horrible man  won't find out that Mr Dunning had anything to do with the rejection of  his paper.' 'I don't think there's much chance of that,' said the  Secretary. 'Dunning won't mention it himself, for these matters are  confidential, and none of us will for the same reason. Karswell won't  know his name, for Dunning hasn't published anything on the same subject  yet. The only danger is that Karswell might find out, if he was to ask  the British Museum people who was in the habit of consulting alchemical  manuscripts: I can't very well tell them not to mention Dunning, can I?  It would set them talking at once. Let's hope it won't occur to him.'    However, Mr Karswell was an astute man.           *       *       *       *       *    This much is in the way of prologue. On an evening rather later in the  same week, Mr Edward Dunning was returning from the British Museum, where  he had been engaged in Research, to the comfortable house in a suburb  where he lived alone, tended by two excellent women who had been long  with him. There is nothing to be added by way of description of him to  what we have heard already. Let us follow him as he takes his sober  course homewards.           *       *       *       *       *    A train took him to within a mile or two of his house, and an electric  tram a stage farther. The line ended at a point some three hundred yards  from his front door. He had had enough of reading when he got into the  car, and indeed the light was not such as to allow him to do more than  study the advertisements on the panes of glass that faced him as he sat.  As was not unnatural, the advertisements in this particular line of cars  were objects of his frequent contemplation, and, with the possible  exception of the brilliant and convincing dialogue between Mr Lamplough  and an eminent K.C. on the subject of Pyretic Saline, none of them  afforded much scope to his imagination. I am wrong: there was one at the  corner of the car farthest from him which did not seem familiar. It was  in blue letters on a yellow ground, and all that he could read of it was  a name--John Harrington--and something like a date. It could be of no  interest to him to know more; but for all that, as the car emptied, he  was just curious enough to move along the seat until he could read it  well. He felt to a slight extent repaid for his trouble; the  advertisement was _not_ of the usual type. It ran thus: 'In memory of  John Harrington, F.S.A., of The Laurels, Ashbrooke. Died Sept. 18th,  1889. Three months were allowed.'    The car stopped. Mr Dunning, still contemplating the blue letters on the  yellow ground, had to be stimulated to rise by a word from the conductor.  'I beg your pardon,' he said, 'I was looking at that advertisement; it's  a very odd one, isn't it?' The conductor read it slowly. 'Well, my word,'  he said, 'I never see that one before. Well, that is a cure, ain't it?  Someone bin up to their jokes 'ere, I should think.' He got out a duster  and applied it, not without saliva, to the pane and then to the outside.  'No,' he said, returning, 'that ain't no transfer; seems to me as if it  was reg'lar _in_ the glass, what I mean in the substance, as you may say.  Don't you think so, sir?' Mr Dunning examined it and rubbed it with his  glove, and agreed. 'Who looks after these advertisements, and gives leave  for them to be put up? I wish you would inquire. I will just take a note  of the words.' At this moment there came a call from the driver: 'Look  alive, George, time's up.' 'All right, all right; there's somethink else  what's up at this end. You come and look at this 'ere glass.' 'What's  gorn with the glass?' said the driver, approaching. 'Well, and oo's  'Arrington? What's it all about?' 'I was just asking who was responsible  for putting the advertisements up in your cars, and saying it would be as  well to make some inquiry about this one.' 'Well, sir, that's all done at  the Company's orfice, that work is: it's our Mr Timms, I believe, looks  into that. When we put up tonight I'll leave word, and per'aps I'll be  able to tell you tomorrer if you 'appen to be coming this way.'    This was all that passed that evening. Mr Dunning did just go to the  trouble of looking up Ashbrooke, and found that it was in Warwickshire.    Next day he went to town again. The car (it was the same car) was too  full in the morning to allow of his getting a word with the conductor: he  could only be sure that the curious advertisement had been made away  with. The close of the day brought a further element of mystery into the  transaction. He had missed the tram, or else preferred walking home, but  at a rather late hour, while he was at work in his study, one of the  maids came to say that two men from the tramways was very anxious to  speak to him. This was a reminder of the advertisement, which he had, he  says, nearly forgotten. He had the men in--they were the conductor and  driver of the car--and when the matter of refreshment had been attended  to, asked what Mr Timms had had to say about the advertisement. 'Well,  sir, that's what we took the liberty to step round about,' said the  conductor. 'Mr Timms 'e give William 'ere the rough side of his tongue  about that: 'cordin' to 'im there warn't no advertisement of that  description sent in, nor ordered, nor paid for, nor put up, nor nothink,  let alone not bein' there, and we was playing the fool takin' up his  time. \"Well,\" I says, \"if that's the case, all I ask of you, Mr Timms,\" I  says, \"is to take and look at it for yourself,\" I says. \"Of course if it  ain't there,\" I says, \"you may take and call me what you like.\" \"Right,\"  he says, \"I will\": and we went straight off. Now, I leave it to you, sir,  if that ad., as we term 'em, with 'Arrington on it warn't as plain as  ever you see anythink--blue letters on yeller glass, and as I says at the  time, and you borne me out, reg'lar _in_ the glass, because, if you  remember, you recollect of me swabbing it with my duster.' 'To be sure I  do, quite clearly--well?' 'You may say well, I don't think. Mr Timms he  gets in that car with a light--no, he telled William to 'old the light  outside. \"Now,\" he says, \"where's your precious ad. what we've 'eard so  much about?\" \"'Ere it is,\" I says, \"Mr Timms,\" and I laid my 'and on it.'  The conductor paused.    'Well,' said Mr Dunning, 'it was gone, I suppose. Broken?'    'Broke!--not it. There warn't, if you'll believe me, no more trace of  them letters--blue letters they was--on that piece o' glass, than--well,  it's no good _me_ talkin'. _I_ never see such a thing. I leave it to  William here if--but there, as I says, where's the benefit in me going on  about it?'    'And what did Mr Timms say?'    'Why 'e did what I give 'im leave to--called us pretty much anythink he  liked, and I don't know as I blame him so much neither. But what we  thought, William and me did, was as we seen you take down a bit of a note  about that--well, that letterin'--'    'I certainly did that, and I have it now. Did you wish me to speak to Mr  Timms myself, and show it to him? Was that what you came in about?'    'There, didn't I say as much?' said William. 'Deal with a gent if you can  get on the track of one, that's my word. Now perhaps, George, you'll  allow as I ain't took you very far wrong tonight.'    'Very well, William, very well; no need for you to go on as if you'd 'ad  to frog's-march me 'ere. I come quiet, didn't I? All the same for that,  we 'adn't ought to take up your time this way, sir; but if it so 'appened  you could find time to step round to the Company's orfice in the morning  and tell Mr Timms what you seen for yourself, we should lay under a very  'igh obligation to you for the trouble. You see it ain't bein'  called--well, one thing and another, as we mind, but if they got it into  their 'ead at the orfice as we seen things as warn't there, why, one  thing leads to another, and where we should be a twelvemunce 'ence--well,  you can understand what I mean.'    Amid further elucidations of the proposition, George, conducted by  William, left the room.    The incredulity of Mr Timms (who had a nodding acquaintance with Mr  Dunning) was greatly modified on the following day by what the latter  could tell and show him; and any bad mark that might have been attached  to the names of William and George was not suffered to remain on the  Company's books; but explanation there was none.    Mr Dunning's interest in the matter was kept alive by an incident of the  following afternoon. He was walking from his club to the train, and he  noticed some way ahead a man with a handful of leaflets such as are  distributed to passers-by by agents of enterprising firms. This agent had  not chosen a very crowded street for his operations: in fact, Mr Dunning  did not see him get rid of a single leaflet before he himself reached the  spot. One was thrust into his hand as he passed: the hand that gave it  touched his, and he experienced a sort of little shock as it did so. It  seemed unnaturally rough and hot. He looked in passing at the giver, but  the impression he got was so unclear that, however much he tried to  reckon it up subsequently, nothing would come. He was walking quickly,  and as he went on glanced at the paper. It was a blue one. The name of  Harrington in large capitals caught his eye. He stopped, startled, and  felt for his glasses. The next instant the leaflet was twitched out of  his hand by a man who hurried past, and was irrecoverably gone. He ran  back a few paces, but where was the passer-by? and where the distributor?    It was in a somewhat pensive frame of mind that Mr Dunning passed on the  following day into the Select Manuscript Room of the British Museum, and  filled up tickets for Harley 3586, and some other volumes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#10)"],[1,".\"    \"Then do but untie my hands and I will fight thee and thy men with no  weapon but only my naked fists. I crave no weapon, but let me not be  meanly hanged this day.\"    Then the Sheriff laughed aloud. \"Why, how now,\" quoth he, \"is thy proud  stomach quailing? Shrive thyself, thou vile knave, for I mean that thou  shalt hang this day, and that where three roads meet, so that all men  shall see thee hang, for carrion crows and daws to peck at.\"    \"O thou dastard heart!\" cried Will Stutely, gnashing his teeth at the  Sheriff. \"Thou coward hind! If ever my good master meet thee thou shalt  pay dearly for this day's work! He doth scorn thee, and so do all brave  hearts. Knowest thou not that thou and thy name are jests upon the lips  of every brave yeoman? Such a one as thou art, thou wretched craven,  will never be able to subdue bold Robin Hood.\"    \"Ha!\" cried the Sheriff in a rage, \"is it even so? Am I a jest with thy  master, as thou callest him? Now I will make a jest of thee and a sorry  jest withal, for I will quarter thee limb from limb, after thou art  hanged.\" Then he spurred his horse forward and said no more to Stutely.    At last they came to the great town gate, through which Stutely saw the  fair country beyond, with hills and dales all clothed in verdure, and  far away the dusky line of Sherwood's skirts. Then when he saw the  slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and  there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing  their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the  swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his  heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he  bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw  the tears in his eyes. Thus he kept his head bowed till they had passed  through the gate and were outside the walls of the town. But when he  looked up again he felt his heart leap within him and then stand still  for pure joy, for he saw the face of one of his own dear companions of  merry Sherwood; then glancing quickly around he saw well-known faces  upon all sides of him, crowding closely upon the men-at-arms who were  guarding him. Then of a sudden the blood sprang to his cheeks, for he  saw for a moment his own good master in the press and, seeing him, knew  that Robin Hood and all his band were there. Yet betwixt him and them  was a line of men-at-arms.    \"Now, stand back!\" cried the Sheriff in a mighty voice, for the crowd  pressed around on all sides. \"What mean ye, varlets, that ye push upon  us so? Stand back, I say!\"    Then came a bustle and a noise, and one strove to push between the  men-at-arms so as to reach the cart, and Stutely saw that it was Little  John that made all that stir.    \"Now stand thou back!\" cried one of the men-at-arms whom Little John  pushed with his elbows.    \"Now stand thou back thine own self,\" quoth Little John, and straightway  smote the man a buffet beside his head that felled him as a butcher  fells an ox, and then he leaped to the cart where Stutely sat.    \"I pray thee take leave of thy friends ere thou diest, Will,\" quoth he,  \"or maybe I will die with thee if thou must die, for I could never have  better company.\" Then with one stroke he cut the bonds that bound the  other's arms and legs, and Stutely leaped straightway from the cart.    \"Now as I live,\" cried the Sheriff, \"yon varlet I know right well is a  sturdy rebel! Take him, I bid you all, and let him not go!\"    So saying, he spurred his horse upon Little John, and rising in his  stirrups smote with might and main, but Little John ducked quickly  underneath the horse's belly and the blow whistled harmlessly over his  head.    \"Nay, good Sir Sheriff,\" cried he, leaping up again when the blow had  passed, \"I must e'en borrow thy most worshipful sword.\" Thereupon he  twitched the weapon deftly from out the Sheriff's hand, \"Here, Stutely,\"  he cried, \"the Sheriff hath lent thee his sword! Back to back with me,  man, and defend thyself, for help is nigh!\"    \"Down with them!\" bellowed the Sheriff in a voice like an angry bull;  and he spurred his horse upon the two who now stood back to back,  forgetting in his rage that he had no weapon with which to defend  himself.    \"Stand back, Sheriff!\" cried Little John; and even as he spoke, a bugle  horn sounded shrilly and a clothyard shaft whistled within an inch of  the Sheriff's head. Then came a swaying hither and thither, and oaths,  cries, and groans, and clashing of steel, and swords flashed in the  setting sun, and a score of arrows whistled through the air. And some  cried, \"Help, help!\" and some, \"A rescue, a rescue!\"    \"Treason!\" cried the Sheriff in a loud voice. \"Bear back! Bear back!  Else we be all dead men!\" Thereupon he reined his horse backward through  the thickest of the crowd.    Now Robin Hood and his band might have slain half of the Sheriff's men  had they desired to do so, but they let them push out of the press and  get them gone, only sending a bunch of arrows after them to hurry them  in their flight.    \"Oh stay!\" shouted Will Stutely after the Sheriff. \"Thou wilt never  catch bold Robin Hood if thou dost not stand to meet him face to face.\"  But the Sheriff, bowing along his horse's back, made no answer but only  spurred the faster.    Then Will Stutely turned to Little John and looked him in the face till  the tears ran down from his eyes and he wept aloud; and kissing his  friend's cheeks, \"O Little John!\" quoth he, \"mine own true friend, and  he that I love better than man or woman in all the world beside!  Little did I reckon to see thy face this day, or to meet thee this side  Paradise.\" Little John could make no answer, but wept also.    Then Robin Hood gathered his band together in a close rank, with Will  Stutely in the midst, and thus they moved slowly away toward Sherwood,  and were gone, as a storm cloud moves away from the spot where a tempest  has swept the land. But they left ten of the Sheriff's men lying along  the ground wounded--some more, some less--yet no one knew who smote them  down.    Thus the Sheriff of Nottingham tried thrice to take Robin Hood and  failed each time; and the last time he was frightened, for he felt how  near he had come to losing his life; so he said, \"These men fear neither  God nor man, nor king nor king's officers. I would sooner lose mine  office than my life, so I will trouble them no more.\" So he kept close  within his castle for many a day and dared not show his face outside of  his own household, and all the time he was gloomy and would speak to no  one, for he was ashamed of what had happened that day.          Robin Hood Turns Butcher    NOW AFTER all these things had happened, and it became known to Robin  Hood how the Sheriff had tried three times to make him captive, he said  to himself, \"If I have the chance, I will make our worshipful Sheriff  pay right well for that which he hath done to me. Maybe I may bring him  some time into Sherwood Forest and have him to a right merry feast with  us.\" For when Robin Hood caught a baron or a squire, or a fat abbot or  bishop, he brought them to the greenwood tree and feasted them before he  lightened their purses.    But in the meantime Robin Hood and his band lived quietly in Sherwood  Forest, without showing their faces abroad, for Robin knew that it would  not be wise for him to be seen in the neighborhood of Nottingham, those  in authority being very wroth with him. But though they did not go  abroad, they lived a merry life within the woodlands, spending the days  in shooting at garlands hung upon a willow wand at the end of the glade,  the leafy aisles ringing with merry jests and laughter: for whoever  missed the garland was given a sound buffet, which, if delivered by  Little John, never failed to topple over the unfortunate yeoman. Then  they had bouts of wrestling and of cudgel play, so that every day they  gained in skill and strength.    Thus they dwelled for nearly a year, and in that time Robin Hood often  turned over in his mind many means of making an even score with the  Sheriff. At last he began to fret at his confinement; so one day he took  up his stout cudgel and set forth to seek adventure, strolling blithely  along until he came to the edge of Sherwood. There, as he rambled along  the sunlit road, he met a lusty young butcher driving a fine mare and  riding in a stout new cart, all hung about with meat. Merrily whistled  the Butcher as he jogged along, for he was going to the market, and the  day was fresh and sweet, making his heart blithe within him.    \"Good morrow to thee, jolly fellow,\" quoth Robin, \"thou seemest happy  this merry morn.\"    \"Ay, that am I,\" quoth the jolly Butcher, \"and why should I not be so?  Am I not hale in wind and limb? Have I not the bonniest lass in all  Nottinghamshire? And lastly, am I not to be married to her on Thursday  next in sweet Locksley Town?\"    \"Ha,\" said Robin, \"comest thou from Locksley Town? Well do I know that  fair place for miles about, and well do I know each hedgerow and gentle  pebbly stream, and even all the bright little fishes therein, for  there I was born and bred. Now, where goest thou with thy meat, my fair  friend?\"    \"I go to the market at Nottingham Town to sell my beef and my mutton,\"  answered the Butcher. \"But who art thou that comest from Locksley Town?\"    \"A yeoman am I, and men do call me Robin Hood.\"    \"Now, by Our Lady's grace,\" cried the Butcher, \"well do I know thy name,  and many a time have I heard thy deeds both sung and spoken of. But  Heaven forbid that thou shouldst take aught of me! An honest man am I,  and have wronged neither man nor maid; so trouble me not, good master,  as I have never troubled thee.\"    \"Nay, Heaven forbid, indeed,\" quoth Robin, \"that I should take from such  as thee, jolly fellow! Not so much as one farthing would I take  from thee, for I love a"]]]
