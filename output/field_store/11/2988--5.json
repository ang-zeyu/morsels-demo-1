The magnitude of this victory can hardly be measured by the ordinary  standard of naval warfare. Outweighing any material advantage is the  moral effect of this initial success. At this unsurpassed achievement  the great heart of our nation throbs, not with boasting or with greed of  conquest, but with deep gratitude that this triumph has come in a just  cause and that by the grace of God an effective step has thus been taken  toward the attainment of the wished-for peace. To those whose skill,  courage, and devotion have won the fight, to the gallant commander and  the brave officers and men who aided him, our country owes an  incalculable debt.    Feeling as our people feel, and speaking in their name, I at once sent  a message to Commodore Dewey thanking him and his officers and men for  their splendid achievement and overwhelming victory and informing him  that I had appointed him an acting rear-admiral.    I now recommend that, following our national precedents and expressing  the fervent gratitude of every patriotic heart, the thanks of Congress  be given Acting Rear-Admiral George Dewey, of the United States Navy,  for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy, and to  the officers and men under his command for their gallantry in the  destruction of the enemy's fleet and the capture of the enemy's  fortifications in the bay of Manila.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 1, 1898_.    _To the Congress of the United States:_    The resolution of Congress passed May 9, 1898, tendering to Commodore  George Dewey, United States Navy, commander in chief of the United  States naval force on the Asiatic station, the thanks of Congress and of  the American people for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with  the enemy, as displayed by him in the destruction of the Spanish fleet  and batteries in the harbor of Manila, Philippine Islands, May 1, 1898,  and through him extending the thanks of Congress and of the American  people to the officers and men under his command for gallantry and  skill exhibited by them on that occasion, required the President to  communicate the same to Commodore Dewey, and through him to the officers  and men under his command. This having been done, through the Secretary  of the Navy, on the 15th of May, 1898, the following response has been  received and is hereby transmitted to the Congress:    I desire to express to the Department, and to request that it will be  transmitted to the President and to Congress, my most sincere thanks for  the great compliment paid to me.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.      JOINT RESOLUTION tendering the thanks of Congress to Commodore George  Dewey, United States Navy, and to the officers and men of the squadron  under his command.    _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled_, That, in pursuance of the  recommendation of the President, made in accordance with the provisions  of section 1508 of the Revised Statutes, the thanks of Congress and  of the American people are hereby tendered to Commodore George Dewey,  United States Navy, commander in chief of the United States naval force  on the Asiatic station, for highly distinguished conduct in conflict  with the enemy, as displayed by him in the destruction of the Spanish  fleet and batteries in the harbor of Manila, Philippine Islands, May 1,  1898.    SEC. 2. That the thanks of Congress and the American people are hereby  extended through Commodore Dewey to the officers and men under his  command for the gallantry and skill exhibited by them on that occasion.    SEC. 3. _Be it further resolved_, That the President of the United  States be requested to cause this resolution to be communicated to  Commodore Dewey, and through him to the officers and men under his  command.    Approved, May 10, 1898.      JOINT RESOLUTION authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to present a  sword of honor to Commodore George Dewey, and to cause to be struck  bronze medals commemorating the battle of Manila Bay, and to distribute  such medals to the officers and men of the ships of the Asiatic Squadron  of the United States.    _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled_, That the Secretary of the  Navy be, and he hereby is, authorized to present a sword of honor to  Commodore George Dewey, and to cause to be struck bronze medals  commemorating the battle of Manila Bay, and to distribute such medals to  the officers and men of the ships of the Asiatic Squadron of the United  States under command of Commodore George Dewey on May 1, 1898; and that  to enable the Secretary to carry out this resolution the sum of $10,000,  or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of  any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.    Approved, June 3, 1898.        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 27, 1898_.    _To the Congress of the United States:_    On the 11th of May, 1898, there occurred a conflict in the bay of  Cardenas, Cuba, in which the naval torpedo boat _Winslow_ was  disabled, her commander wounded, and one of her officers and a part  of her crew killed by the enemy's fire.    In the face of a most galling fire from the enemy's guns the revenue  cutter _Hudson_, commanded by First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb,  United States Revenue-Cutter Service, rescued the disabled  _Winslow_, her wounded commander and remaining crew. The commander  of the _Hudson_ kept his vessel in the very hottest fire of the  action, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the  shallow water, until he finally got a line made fast to the  _Winslow_ and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy's guns--a  deed of special gallantry.    I recommend that in recognition of the signal act of heroism of First  Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, United States Revenue-Cutter Service, above  set forth, the thanks of Congress be extended to him and to his officers  and men of the _Hudson_, and that a gold medal of honor be  presented to Lieutenant Newcomb, a silver medal of honor to each of his  officers, and a bronze medal of honor to each member of his crew who  served with him at Cardenas.    It will be remembered that Congress by appropriate action recognized the  several commanders of ships of war for their services in the battle of  Manila, May 1, 1898.    The commander of the revenue cutter _Hugh McCulloch_, present and  in active cooperation with the fleet under Commodore Dewey on that  occasion (by Executive order under the provisions of section 2757,  Revised Statutes), is the only commander of a national ship to whom  promotion or advancement was not and could not be given, because he  already held the highest rank known to the Revenue-Cutter Service.    I now recommend that in recognition of the efficient and meritorious  services of Captain Daniel B. Hodgsdon, United States Revenue-Cutter  Service, who commanded the _Hugh McCulloch_ at the battle of Manila  (that officer being now in the sixty-third year of his age and having  served continuously on active duty for thirty-seven years), he be placed  upon the permanent waiting-orders or retired list of the Revenue-Cutter  Service on the full-duty pay of his grade.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 27, 1898_.    _To the Congress of the United States:_    On the morning of the 3d of June, 1898, Assistant Naval Constructor  Richmond P. Hobson, United States Navy, with a volunteer crew of seven  men, in charge of the partially dismantled collier _Merrimac_,  entered the fortified harbor of Santiago, Cuba, for the purpose of  sinking the collier in the narrowest portion of the channel, and thus  interposing a serious obstacle to the egress of the Spanish fleet which  had recently entered that harbor. This enterprise, demanding coolness,  judgment, and bravery amounting to heroism, was carried into successful  execution in the face of a persistent fire from the hostile fleet as  well as from the fortifications on shore.    Rear-Admiral Sampson, commander in chief of our naval force in Cuban  waters, in an official report dated \"Off Santiago de Cuba, June 3,  1898,\" and addressed to the Secretary of the Navy, referring to Mr.  Hobson's gallant exploit, says:      As stated in a recent telegram, before coming here I decided to make the    harbor entrance secure against the possibility of egress of the Spanish    ships by obstructing the narrow part of the entrance by sinking a    collier at that point. Upon calling upon Mr. Hobson for his professional    opinion as to a sure method of sinking the ship, he manifested a most    lively interest in the problem. After several days' consideration he    presented a solution which he considered would insure the immediate    sinking of the ship when she had reached the desired point in the    channel. * * * The plan contemplated a crew of only seven men and Mr.    Hobson, who begged that it might be intrusted to him.      As soon as I reached Santiago and had the collier to work upon, the    details were commenced and diligently prosecuted, hoping to complete    them in one day, as the moon and tide served best the first night after    our arrival. Notwithstanding every effort, the hour of 4 o'clock in the    morning arrived and the preparations were scarcely completed. After a    careful inspection of the final preparations I was forced to relinquish    the plan for that morning, as dawn was breaking. Mr. Hobson begged to    try it at all hazards.      This morning proved more propitious, as a prompt start could be made.    Nothing could have been more gallantly executed. * * * A careful    inspection of the harbor from this ship showed that the _Merrimac_    had been sunk in the channel.      I can not myself too earnestly express my appreciation of the conduct of    Mr. Hobson and his gallant crew. I venture to say that a more brave and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#11)"],[1," heavy game-heads, the best of their  sort from every quarter of the world, with the rare white rhinoceros of  the Lado Enclave drooping its supercilious lip above them all.    In the center of the rich red carpet was a black and gold Louis Quinze  table, a lovely antique, now sacrilegiously desecrated with marks of  glasses and the scars of cigar-stumps.  On it stood a silver tray of  smokables and a burnished spirit-stand, from which and an adjacent  siphon my silent host proceeded to charge two high glasses.  Having  indicated an arm-chair to me and placed my refreshment near it, he  handed me a long, smooth Havana.  Then, seating himself opposite to me,  he looked at me long and fixedly with his strange, twinkling, reckless  eyes--eyes of a cold light blue, the color of a glacier lake.    Through the thin haze of my cigar-smoke I noted the details of a face  which was already familiar to me from many photographs--the  strongly-curved nose, the hollow, worn cheeks, the dark, ruddy hair,  thin at the top, the crisp, virile moustaches, the small, aggressive  tuft upon his projecting chin.  Something there was of Napoleon III.,  something of Don Quixote, and yet again something which was the essence  of the English country gentleman, the keen, alert, open-air lover of  dogs and of horses.  His skin was of a rich flower-pot red from sun and  wind.  His eyebrows were tufted and overhanging, which gave those  naturally cold eyes an almost ferocious aspect, an impression which was  increased by his strong and furrowed brow.  In figure he was spare, but  very strongly built--indeed, he had often proved that there were few  men in England capable of such sustained exertions.  His height was a  little over six feet, but he seemed shorter on account of a peculiar  rounding of the shoulders.  Such was the famous Lord John Roxton as he  sat opposite to me, biting hard upon his cigar and watching me steadily  in a long and embarrassing silence.    \"Well,\" said he, at last, \"we've gone and done it, young fellah my  lad.\"  (This curious phrase he pronounced as if it were all one  word--\"young-fellah-me-lad.\")  \"Yes, we've taken a jump, you an' me.  I  suppose, now, when you went into that room there was no such notion in  your head--what?\"    \"No thought of it.\"    \"The same here.  No thought of it.  And here we are, up to our necks in  the tureen.  Why, I've only been back three weeks from Uganda, and  taken a place in Scotland, and signed the lease and all.  Pretty goin's  on--what?  How does it hit you?\"    \"Well, it is all in the main line of my business.  I am a journalist on  the Gazette.\"    \"Of course--you said so when you took it on.  By the way, I've got a  small job for you, if you'll help me.\"    \"With pleasure.\"    \"Don't mind takin' a risk, do you?\"    \"What is the risk?\"    \"Well, it's Ballinger--he's the risk.  You've heard of him?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why, young fellah, where HAVE you lived?  Sir John Ballinger is the  best gentleman jock in the north country.  I could hold him on the flat  at my best, but over jumps he's my master.  Well, it's an open secret  that when he's out of trainin' he drinks hard--strikin' an average, he  calls it.  He got delirium on Toosday, and has been ragin' like a devil  ever since.  His room is above this.  The doctors say that it is all up  with the old dear unless some food is got into him, but as he lies in  bed with a revolver on his coverlet, and swears he will put six of the  best through anyone that comes near him, there's been a bit of a strike  among the serving-men.  He's a hard nail, is Jack, and a dead shot,  too, but you can't leave a Grand National winner to die like  that--what?\"    \"What do you mean to do, then?\" I asked.    \"Well, my idea was that you and I could rush him.  He may be dozin',  and at the worst he can only wing one of us, and the other should have  him.  If we can get his bolster-cover round his arms and then 'phone up  a stomach-pump, we'll give the old dear the supper of his life.\"    It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into one's day's  work.  I don't think that I am a particularly brave man.  I have an  Irish imagination which makes the unknown and the untried more terrible  than they are.  On the other hand, I was brought up with a horror of  cowardice and with a terror of such a stigma.  I dare say that I could  throw myself over a precipice, like the Hun in the history books, if my  courage to do it were questioned, and yet it would surely be pride and  fear, rather than courage, which would be my inspiration.  Therefore,  although every nerve in my body shrank from the whisky-maddened figure  which I pictured in the room above, I still answered, in as careless a  voice as I could command, that I was ready to go.  Some further remark  of Lord Roxton's about the danger only made me irritable.    \"Talking won't make it any better,\" said I. \"Come on.\"    I rose from my chair and he from his.  Then with a little confidential  chuckle of laughter, he patted me two or three times on the chest,  finally pushing me back into my chair.    \"All right, sonny my lad--you'll do,\" said he.  I looked up in surprise.    \"I saw after Jack Ballinger myself this mornin'.  He blew a hole in the  skirt of my kimono, bless his shaky old hand, but we got a jacket on  him, and he's to be all right in a week.  I say, young fellah, I hope  you don't mind--what?  You see, between you an' me close-tiled, I look  on this South American business as a mighty serious thing, and if I  have a pal with me I want a man I can bank on.  So I sized you down,  and I'm bound to say that you came well out of it.  You see, it's all  up to you and me, for this old Summerlee man will want dry-nursin' from  the first.  By the way, are you by any chance the Malone who is  expected to get his Rugby cap for Ireland?\"    \"A reserve, perhaps.\"    \"I thought I remembered your face.  Why, I was there when you got that  try against Richmond--as fine a swervin' run as I saw the whole season.  I never miss a Rugby match if I can help it, for it is the manliest  game we have left.  Well, I didn't ask you in here just to talk sport.  We've got to fix our business.  Here are the sailin's, on the first  page of the Times.  There's a Booth boat for Para next Wednesday week,  and if the Professor and you can work it, I think we should take  it--what?  Very good, I'll fix it with him.  What about your outfit?\"    \"My paper will see to that.\"    \"Can you shoot?\"    \"About average Territorial standard.\"    \"Good Lord! as bad as that?  It's the last thing you young fellahs  think of learnin'.  You're all bees without stings, so far as lookin'  after the hive goes.  You'll look silly, some o' these days, when  someone comes along an' sneaks the honey.  But you'll need to hold your  gun straight in South America, for, unless our friend the Professor is  a madman or a liar, we may see some queer things before we get back.  What gun have you?\"    He crossed to an oaken cupboard, and as he threw it open I caught a  glimpse of glistening rows of parallel barrels, like the pipes of an  organ.    \"I'll see what I can spare you out of my own battery,\" said he.    One by one he took out a succession of beautiful rifles, opening and  shutting them with a snap and a clang, and then patting them as he put  them back into the rack as tenderly as a mother would fondle her  children.    \"This is a Bland's .577 axite express,\" said he.  \"I got that big  fellow with it.\"  He glanced up at the white rhinoceros.  \"Ten more  yards, and he'd would have added me to HIS collection.             'On that conical bullet his one chance hangs,           'Tis the weak one's advantage fair.'    Hope you know your Gordon, for he's the poet of the horse and the gun  and the man that handles both.  Now, here's a useful tool--.470,  telescopic sight, double ejector, point-blank up to three-fifty.  That's the rifle I used against the Peruvian slave-drivers three years  ago.  I was the flail of the Lord up in those parts, I may tell you,  though you won't find it in any Blue-book.  There are times, young  fellah, when every one of us must make a stand for human right and  justice, or you never feel clean again.  That's why I made a little war  on my own.  Declared it myself, waged it myself, ended it myself.  Each  of those nicks is for a slave murderer--a good row of them--what?  That  big one is for Pedro Lopez, the king of them all, that I killed in a  backwater of the Putomayo River.  Now, here's something that would do  for you.\"  He took out a beautiful brown-and-silver rifle.  \"Well  rubbered at the stock, sharply sighted, five cartridges to the clip.  You can trust your life to that.\"  He handed it to me and closed the  door of his oak cabinet.    \"By the way,\" he continued, coming back to his chair, \"what do you know  of this Professor Challenger?\"    \"I never saw him till to-day.\"    \"Well, neither did I.  It's funny we should both sail under sealed  orders from a man we don't know.  He seemed an uppish old bird.  His  brothers of science don't seem too fond of him, either.  How came you  to take an interest in the affair?\"    I told him shortly my experiences of the morning, and he listened  intently.  Then he drew out a map of South America and laid it on the  table.    \"I believe every single word he said to you was the truth,\" said he,  earnestly, \"and, mind you, I have something to go on when I speak like  that.  South America is a place I love, and I think, if you take it  right through from Darien to Fuego, it's the grandest, richest, most  wonderful bit of earth upon this planet.  People don't know it yet, and  don't realize what it may become.  I've been up an' down it from end to  end, and had two dry seasons in those very parts, as I told you when I  spoke of the war I made on the slave-dealers.  Well, when I was up  there I heard some yarns of the same kind--traditions of Indians and  the like, but with"]]]
