We  saw their big, black faces through the underbrush, and they looked  like devils. They came forward under our fire as if they didn't the  least care about it.\"    THE CHARGE AT EL CANEY.    It was the Tenth Cavalry that had this effect on the Spaniards. At  San Juan the Ninth Cavalry distinguished itself, its commander,  Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, being killed. The fourth of the Negro  regiments, the Twenty-fifth Infantry, played an especially brilliant  part in the battle of El Caney on July 1st. It was held in reserve  with the rest of Colonel Miles' brigade, but was ordered to support  General Lawton's brigade toward the middle of the day. At that hour  marching was an ordeal, but the men went on at a fast pace. With  almost no rest they kept it up until they got into action. The other  troops had been fighting hard for hours, and the arrival of the  Twenty-fifth was a blessing. The Negroes went right ahead through the  tired ranks of their comrades. Their charge up the hill, which was  surmounted by Spanish rifle pits and a stone fort, has been told. It  was the work of only a part of the regiment, the men coming chiefly  from three companies. Colonel Milts had intended having his whole  brigade make the final charge, but the Twenty-fifth didn't wait for  orders. It was there to take that hill, and take the hill it did.    One of the Spanish officers captured there seemed to think that the  Americans were taking an unfair advantage of them in having colored  men who fought like that. He had been accustomed to the Negroes in the  insurgent army, and a different lot they are from those in the United  States army.    \"Why,\" he said ruefully, \"even your Negroes fight better than any  other troops I ever saw.\"    The way the Negroes charged up the El Caney and San Juan hills  suggested inevitably that their African nature has not been entirely  eliminated by generations of civilization, but was bursting forth in  savage yells and in that wild rush some of them were fairly frantic  with the delight of the battle. And it was no mere craziness. They  are excellent marksmen, and they aim carefully and well. Woe to the  Spaniards who showed themselves above the trenches when a colored  regiment was in good range. MAGNIFICENT SHOWING MADE BY THE  NEGROES--THEIR SPLENDID COURAGE AT SANTIAGO THE ADMIRATION OF ALL  OFFICERS.    They were led by Southern Men--Black Men from the South Fought Like  Tigers and end a Question often debated--In only One or Two Actions of  the Civil War was there such a loss of Officers as at San Juan.    [TELEGRAM TO COMMERCIAL.]    WASHINGTON, July 6, 1898.    Veterans who are comparing the losses at the battle of San Juan, near  Santiago, last Friday, with those at Big Bethel and the first Bull Run  say that in only one or two actions of the late war was there such a  loss in officers as occurred at San Juan hill.    The companies of the Twenty-fourth Infantry are without officers. The  regiment had four captains knocked down within a minute of each other.  Capt. A.C. Ducat was the first officer hit in the action, and was  killed instantly. His second lieutenant, John A. Gurney, a Michigan  man, was struck dead at the same time as the captain, and Lieutenant  Henry G. Lyon was left in command of Company D, but only for a few  minutes, for he, too, went down. Liscum, commanding the regiment, was  killed.    NEGROES FIGHT LIKE TIGERS.    Company F, Twenty-fourth Infantry, lost Lieutenant Augustin, of  Louisiana, killed, and Captain Crane was left without a commissioned  officer. The magnificent courage of the Mississippi, Louisiana,  Arkansas and Texas Negroes, which make up the rank and file of this  regiment, is the admiration of every officer who has written here  since the fight. The regiment has a large proportion of Southern-born  officers, who led their men with more than usual exposure. These men  had always said the Southern Negro would fight as staunchly as any  white man, if he was led by those in whom he had confidence. The  question has often been debated in every mess of the army. San Juan  hill offered the first occasion in which this theory could be tested  practically, and tested it was in a manner and with a result that  makes its believers proud of the men they commanded. It has helped  the morale of the four Negro regiments beyond words. The men of the  Twenty-fourth Infantry, particularly, and their comrades of the Ninth  and Tenth Cavalry as well, are proud of the record they made.    THEY NEVER WAVERED.    The Twenty-fourth took the brunt of the fight, and all through it,  even when whole companies were left without an officer, not for a  moment were these colored soldiers shaken or wavering in the face of  the fierce attack made upon them. Wounded Spanish officers declare  that the attack was thus directed because they did not believe the  Negro would stand up against them and they believed there was the  faulty place in the American line. Never were men more amazed than  were the Spanish officers to see the steadiness and cool courage with  which the Twenty-fourth charged front forward on its tenth company (a  difficult thing to do at any time), under the hottest fire. The value  of the Negro as a soldier is no longer a debatable question.    It has been proven fully in one of the sharpest fights of the past  three years.           *       *       *       *       *    \"OUR BOYS,\" THE SOLDIERS.    \"What Army Officers and Others Have to Say of the Negroes Conduct in  War\"--\"Give Honor to Whom Honor is Due\"--\"Acme of Bravery.\"    It has been said, \"Give honor to whom honor is due,\" and while it is  just and right that it should be so, there are times, however, when  the \"honor\" due is withheld. Ever since the battle of San Juan Hill at  Santiago de Cuba nearly every paper in the land has had nothing but  praise for the bravery shown by the \"Rough Riders,\" and to the extent  that, not knowing the truth, one would naturally arrive at the  conclusion that the \"Rough Riders\" were \"the whole thing.\" Although  sometimes delayed, the truth, like murder, \"will out.\" It is well  enough to praise the \"Rough Riders\" for all they did, but why not  divide honors with the other fellows who made it possible for them,  the \"Rough Riders,\" to receive praise, and be honored by a generous  and valorous loving nation?    After the battles of El Caney and San Juan Hill, many wounded American  soldiers who were able to travel were given furloughs to their  respective homes in the United States, and Lieutenant Thomas Roberts,  of this city, was one of them. Shortly after Lieutenant Roberts  arrived in the city he was interviewed by a representative of the  _Illinois State Register_, to whom he gave a description of the battle  of July 1st. He said: \"On the night of June 30th the second squadron  of the Tenth Cavalry did outpost duty. Daylight opened on the  soon-to-be blood-sodden field on July 1st, and the Tenth was ordered  to the front. First went the first squadron, followed soon after by  the second, composed of Troops G, I, B and A. The Tenth Cavalry is  composed of Negroes, commanded by white officers, and I have naught  but the highest praise for the swarthy warriors on the field of  carnage. Led by brave men, they will go into the thickest of the  fight, even to the wicked mouths of deadly cannon, unflinchingly.\"    Lieutenant Roberts says further that \"at 9 o'clock on the morning of  July 1st the order came to move. Forward we went, until we struck a  road between two groves, which road was swept by a hail of shot and  shell from Spanish guns. The men stood their ground as if on dress  parade. Single file, every man ready to obey any command, they bade  defiance to the fiercest storm of leaden hail that ever hurtled over a  troop of United States cavalry. The order came, 'Get under cover,' and  the Seventy-first New York and the Tenth Cavalry took opposite sides  of the road and lay down in the bushes. For a short time no orders  came, and feeling a misapprehension of the issue, I hastened forward  to consult with the first lieutenant of the company. We found that  through a misinterpreted order the captain of the troop and eight  men had gone forward. Hastening back to my post I consulted with the  captain in the rear of Troop G, and the quartermaster appeared upon  the scene asking the whereabouts of the Tenth Cavalry. They made known  their presence, and the quartermaster told them to go on, showing the  path, the quartermaster led them forward until the bend in the  San Juan River was reached. Here the first bloodshed in the Tenth  occurred, a young-volunteer named Baldwin fell, pierced by a Spanish  ball.\"    An aide hastened up and gave the colonel of the regiment orders to  move forward. The summit of the hill was crowned by two block-houses,  and from these came an unceasing fire. Lieutenant Roberts said he had  been lying on the ground but rose to his knees to repeat an order,  \"Move forward,\" when a mauser ball struck him in the abdomen and  passed entirely through his body. Being wounded, he was carried off of  the field, but after all was over, Lieutenant Roberts says it was said  (on the quiet, of course) that \"the heroic charge of the Tenth Cavalry  saved the 'Rough Riders' from destruction.\" Lieutenant Roberts says  he left Cuba on the 12th of July for Fort Monroe, and that a wounded  Rough Rider told him while coming over that \"had it not been for the  Tenth Cavalry the Rough Riders would never passed through the seething  cauldron of Spanish missiles.\" Such is the statement of one of  Springfield's best citizens, a member of the Tenth Cavalry, United  States regulars.    [Illustration: FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE CUBAN REPUBLIC.]    Some days later, Lieutenant Roberts had occasion to visit Chicago and  Fort Sheridan, and while there he was interviewed by a representative  of the Chicago Chronicle, to whom he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#11)"],[1,"      shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any      State on account of sex.        SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation,      to enforce the provisions of this article.    Fortunately for the perpetuity of our institutions and the prosperity  of the people, the Federal Constitution contains a provision for its  own amendment. The framers of that instrument foresaw that time and  experience, the growth of the country and the consequent expansion of  the Government, would develop the necessity for changes in it, and  they therefore wisely provided in Article V as follows:        The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it      necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on      the application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several      States, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in      either case shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part      of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of      three-fourths of the several States, or by conventions in      three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of      ratification may be proposed by the Congress.    Under this provision, at the first session of the First Congress, ten  amendments were submitted to the Legislatures of the several States,  in due time ratified by the constitutional number of States, and  became a part of the Constitution. Since then there have been added to  the Constitution by the same process five different articles.    To secure an amendment to the Constitution under this article requires  the concurrent action of two-thirds of both branches of Congress and  the affirmative action of three-fourths of the States. Of course  Congress can refuse to submit a proposed amendment to the Legislatures  of the several States, no matter how general the demand for such  submission may be, but I am inclined to believe with the senior  Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. BLAIR], in the proposition submitted  by him in a speech he made early in the present session upon the  pending resolution, that the question as to whether this resolution  shall be submitted to the Legislatures of the several States for  ratification does not involve the right or policy of the proposed  amendment. I am also inclined to believe with him that should  the demand by the people for the submission by Congress to the  Legislatures of the several States of a proposed amendment become  general it would he the duty of the Congress to submit such amendment  irrespective of the individual views of the members of Congress, and  thus give the people through their Legislative Assemblies power to  pass upon the question as to whether or not the Constitution should be  amended. At all events, for myself, I should not hesitate to vote to  submit for ratification by the Legislatures of the several States an  amendment to the Constitution although opposed to it if I thought the  demand for it justified such a course.    But I shall vote for the pending joint resolution because I am in  favor of the proposed amendment. I have been for many years convinced  that the demand made by women for the right of suffrage is just, and  that of all the distinctions which have been made between citizens in  the laws which confer or regulate suffrage the distinction of sex is  the least defensible.    I am not going to discuss the question at length at this time. The  arguments for and against woman suffrage have been often stated in  this Chamber, and are pretty fully set forth in the majority and  minority reports of the Senate committee upon the pending joint  resolution. The arguments in its favor were fully stated by the senior  Senator from New Hampshire in his able speech upon the question before  alluded to, and now the objections to it have been forcibly and  elaborately presented by the senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. BROWN].  I could not expect by anything I could say to change a single vote in  this body, and the public is already fully informed upon the question,  as the arguments in favor of woman suffrage have been voiced in every  hamlet in the land with great ability. No question in this country has  been more ably discussed than this has been by the women themselves.    I do not think a single objection which is made to woman suffrage is  tenable. No one will contend but that women have sufficient capacity  to vote intelligently.    Sir, sacred and profane history is full of the records of great deeds  by women. They have ruled kingdoms, and, my friend from Georgia to  the contrary notwithstanding, they have commanded armies. They have  excelled in statecraft, they have shone in literature, and, rising  superior to their environments and breaking the shackles with which  custom and tyranny have bound them, they have stood side by side with  men in the fields of the arts and the sciences.    If it were a fact that woman is intellectually inferior to man, which  I do not admit, still that would be no reason why she should not  be permitted to participate in the formation and control of the  Government to which she owes allegiance. If we are to have as a test  for the exercise of the right of suffrage a qualification based upon  intelligence, let it be applied to women and to men alike. If it be  admitted that suffrage is a right, that is the end of controversy;  there can no longer be any argument made against woman suffrage,  because, if it is her right, then, if there were but one poor woman  in all the United States demanding the right of suffrage, it would be  tyranny to refuse the demand.    But our friends say that suffrage is not a right; that it is a matter  of grace only; that it is a privilege which is conferred upon or  withheld from individual members of society by society at pleasure.  Society as here used means man's government, and the proposition  assumes the fact that men have a right to institute and control  governments for themselves and for women. I admit that in the  governments of the world, past and present, men as a rule have assumed  to be the ruling classes; that they have instituted governments from  participation in which they have excluded women; that they have made  laws for themselves and for women, and as a rule have themselves  administered them; but that the provisions conferring or regulating  suffrage in the constitutions and laws of governments so constituted  determined the question of the right of suffrage can not be  maintained.    Let us suppose, if we can, a community separated from all other  communities, having no organized government, owing no allegiance to  any existing governments, without any knowledge of the character  of present or past governments, so that when they come to form a  government for themselves they can do so free from the bias or  prejudice of custom or education, composed of an equal number of  men and women, having equal property rights to be defined and to  be protected by law. When such community came to institute a  government--and it would have an undoubted right to institute a  government for itself, and the instinct of self-preservation would  soon lead them to do so--will my friend from Georgia tell me by what  right, human or divine, the male portion of that community could  exclude the female portion, although equal in number and having equal  property rights with the men, from participation in the formation of  such government and in the enactment of laws for the government of the  community? I understand the Senator, if he should answer, would  say that he believes the Author of our existence, the Ruler of the  universe, has given different spheres to man and woman. Admit that;  and still neither in nature nor in the revealed will of God do I find  anything to lead me to believe that the Creator did not intend that a  woman should exercise the right of suffrage.    During the consideration by this body at the last session of the bill  to admit Washington Territory into the Union, referring to the  fact that in that Territory woman had been enfranchised, I briefly  submitted my views on this subject, which I ask the Secretary to read,  so that it may be incorporated in my remarks.    The Secretary read as follows:        Mr. President, there is another matter which I consider pertinent      to this discussion, and of too much importance to be left entirely      unnoticed on this occasion. It is something new in our political      history. It is full of hope for the women of this country and      of the world, and full of promise for the future of republican      institutions. I refer to the fact that in Washington Territory the      right of suffrage has been extended to women of proper age, and      that the delegates to the constitutional convention to be held      under the provisions of this bill, should it become a law, will,      under existing laws of the Territory, be elected by its citizens      without distinction as to sex, and the constitution to be      submitted to the people will be passed upon in like manner.        I do not intend to discuss the question of woman suffrage upon      this occasion, and I refer to it mainly for the purpose of      directing attention to the advanced position which the people of      this Territory have taken upon this question. I do not believe      the proposition so often asserted that suffrage is a political      privilege only, and not a natural right. It is regulated by      the constitution and laws of a State I grant, but it needs no      argument, it appears to me, to show that a constitution and laws      adopted and enacted by a fragment of the whole body of the people,      but binding alike on all, is a usurpation of the powers of      government.          Government is but organized society. Whatever its form, it has its      origin in the necessities of mankind and is indispensable for      the"]]]
