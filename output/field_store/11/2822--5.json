Light  Kindled in heav'n, spontaneous, self-inform'd,  Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse  By will divine.  Portray'd before me came  The traces of her dire impiety,  Whose form was chang'd into the bird, that most  Delights itself in song: and here my mind  Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place  To aught that ask'd admittance from without.    Next shower'd into my fantasy a shape  As of one crucified, whose visage spake  Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;  And round him Ahasuerus the great king,  Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,  Blameless in word and deed.  As of itself  That unsubstantial coinage of the brain  Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails  That fed it; in my vision straight uprose  A damsel weeping loud, and cried, \"O queen!  O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire  Driv'n thee to loath thy being?  Not to lose  Lavinia, desp'rate thou hast slain thyself.  Now hast thou lost me.  I am she, whose tears  Mourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end.\"    E'en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly  New radiance strike upon the closed lids,  The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;  Thus from before me sunk that imagery  Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck  The light, outshining far our earthly beam.  As round I turn'd me to survey what place  I had arriv'd at, \"Here ye mount,\" exclaim'd  A voice, that other purpose left me none,  Save will so eager to behold who spake,  I could not choose but gaze.  As 'fore the sun,  That weighs our vision down, and veils his form  In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd  Unequal.  \"This is Spirit from above,  Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;  And in his own light shrouds him.  As a man  Doth for himself, so now is done for us.  For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need  Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar'd  For blunt denial, ere the suit be made.  Refuse we not to lend a ready foot  At such inviting: haste we to ascend,  Before it darken: for we may not then,  Till morn again return.\"  So spake my guide;  And to one ladder both address'd our steps;  And the first stair approaching, I perceiv'd  Near me as 'twere the waving of a wing,  That fann'd my face and whisper'd: \"Blessed they  The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.\"    Now to such height above our heads were rais'd  The last beams, follow'd close by hooded night,  That many a star on all sides through the gloom  Shone out.  \"Why partest from me, O my strength?\"  So with myself I commun'd; for I felt  My o'ertoil'd sinews slacken.  We had reach'd  The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark  Arriv'd at land.  And waiting a short space,  If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,  Then to my guide I turn'd, and said: \"Lov'd sire!  Declare what guilt is on this circle purg'd.  If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.\"    He thus to me: \"The love of good, whate'er  Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils.  Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.  But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,  Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull  Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay.    \"Creator, nor created being, ne'er,  My son,\" he thus began, \"was without love,  Or natural, or the free spirit's growth.  Thou hast not that to learn.  The natural still  Is without error; but the other swerves,  If on ill object bent, or through excess  Of vigour, or defect.  While e'er it seeks  The primal blessings, or with measure due  Th' inferior, no delight, that flows from it,  Partakes of ill.  But let it warp to evil,  Or with more ardour than behooves, or less.  Pursue the good, the thing created then  Works 'gainst its Maker.  Hence thou must infer  That love is germin of each virtue in ye,  And of each act no less, that merits pain.  Now since it may not be, but love intend  The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,  All from self-hatred are secure; and since  No being can be thought t' exist apart  And independent of the first, a bar  Of equal force restrains from hating that.    \"Grant the distinction just; and it remains  The' evil must be another's, which is lov'd.  Three ways such love is gender'd in your clay.  There is who hopes (his neighbour's worth deprest,)  Preeminence himself, and coverts hence  For his own greatness that another fall.  There is who so much fears the loss of power,  Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount  Above him), and so sickens at the thought,  He loves their opposite: and there is he,  Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame  That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs  Must doat on other's evil.  Here beneath  This threefold love is mourn'd.  Of th' other sort  Be now instructed, that which follows good  But with disorder'd and irregular course.    \"All indistinctly apprehend a bliss  On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all  Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn  All therefore strive to tend.  If ye behold  Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,  This cornice after just repenting lays  Its penal torment on ye.  Other good  There is, where man finds not his happiness:  It is not true fruition, not that blest  Essence, of every good the branch and root.  The love too lavishly bestow'd on this,  Along three circles over us, is mourn'd.  Account of that division tripartite  Expect not, fitter for thine own research.\"          CANTO XVIII    The teacher ended, and his high discourse  Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir'd  If I appear'd content; and I, whom still  Unsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,  Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:  \"Perchance my too much questioning offends\"  But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish  By diffidence restrain'd, and speaking, gave  Me boldness thus to speak: 'Master, my Sight  Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,  That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.  Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart  Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold  That love, from which as from their source thou bring'st  All good deeds and their opposite.'\"  He then:  \"To what I now disclose be thy clear ken  Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold  How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves  The guides of men.  The soul, created apt  To love, moves versatile which way soe'er  Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak'd  By pleasure into act.  Of substance true  Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,  And in you the ideal shape presenting  Attracts the soul's regard.  If she, thus drawn,  incline toward it, love is that inclining,  And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.  Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks  His birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus  Enters the captive soul into desire,  Which is a spiritual motion, that ne'er rests  Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.  Enough to show thee, how the truth from those  Is hidden, who aver all love a thing  Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps  Its substance seem still good.  Yet if the wax  Be good, it follows not th' impression must.\"  \"What love is,\" I return'd, \"thy words, O guide!  And my own docile mind, reveal.  Yet thence  New doubts have sprung.  For from without if love  Be offer'd to us, and the spirit knows  No other footing, tend she right or wrong,  Is no desert of hers.\"  He answering thus:  \"What reason here discovers I have power  To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect  From Beatrice, faith not reason's task.  Spirit, substantial form, with matter join'd  Not in confusion mix'd, hath in itself  Specific virtue of that union born,  Which is not felt except it work, nor prov'd  But through effect, as vegetable life  By the green leaf.  From whence his intellect  Deduced its primal notices of things,  Man therefore knows not, or his appetites  Their first affections; such in you, as zeal  In bees to gather honey; at the first,  Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise.  But o'er each lower faculty supreme,  That as she list are summon'd to her bar,  Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice  Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep  The threshold of assent.  Here is the source,  Whence cause of merit in you is deriv'd,  E'en as the affections good or ill she takes,  Or severs, winnow'd as the chaff.  Those men  Who reas'ning went to depth profoundest, mark'd  That innate freedom, and were thence induc'd  To leave their moral teaching to the world.  Grant then, that from necessity arise  All love that glows within you; to dismiss  Or harbour it, the pow'r is in yourselves.  Remember, Beatrice, in her style,  Denominates free choice by eminence  The noble virtue, if in talk with thee  She touch upon that theme.\"  The moon, well nigh  To midnight hour belated, made the stars  Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk  Seem'd like a crag on fire, as up the vault  That course she journey'd, which the sun then warms,  When they of Rome behold him at his set.  Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.  And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,  Was lighten'd by the aid of that clear spirit,  Who raiseth Andes above Mantua's name.  I therefore, when my questions had obtain'd  Solution plain and ample, stood as one  Musing in dreary slumber; but not long  Slumber'd; for suddenly a multitude,    The steep already turning, from behind,  Rush'd on.  With fury and like random rout,  As echoing on their shores at midnight heard  Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes  If Bacchus' help were needed; so came these  Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,  By eagerness impell'd of holy love.    Soon they o'ertook us; with such swiftness mov'd  The mighty crowd.  Two spirits at their head  Cried weeping; \"Blessed Mary sought with haste  The hilly region.  Caesar to subdue  Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,  And flew to Spain.\"--\"Oh tarry not: away;\"  The others shouted; \"let not time be lost  Through slackness of affection.  Hearty zeal  To"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#11)"],[1,"said: \"The whole human race will be affected by the  proceedings of this convention.\" After it adjourned one of its greatest  participants, James Wilson, of Pennsylvania, said:        \"After the lapse of six thousand years since the creation of the      world, America now presents the first instance of a people assembled      to say deliberately and calmly and to decide leisurely and peaceably      on the form of government by which they will bind themselves and      their posterity.\"    In the absence of any authentic information, the rumour spread through  the colonies that the convention was about to reconstitute a monarchy by  inviting the second son of George III, the Bishop of Osnaburg, to be  King of the United States; and these rumours became so persistent as to  evoke from the silent convention a semi-official denial. There is some  reason to believe that a minority of the convention did see in the  restoration of a constitutional monarchy the only solution of the  problem.    On September 8 the committee had finally considered and, after  modifications, approved the draft of the Committee on Detail, and a new  committee was thereupon appointed \"to revise the style of and arrange  the articles that had been agreed to by the House.\" This committee was  one of exceptional strength. There were Dr. William Samuel Johnson, a  graduate of Oxford and a friend of his great namesake, Samuel Johnson;  Alexander Hamilton, Gouveneur Morris, a brilliant mind with an unusual  gift for lucid expression; James Madison, a true scholar in politics,  and Rufus King, an orator who, in the inflated language of the day, \"was  ranked among the luminaries of the present age.\"    The convention then adjourned to await the final revision of the draft  by the Committee on Style.    On September 12 the committee reported. While it is not certain, it is  believed that its work was largely that of Gouveneur Morris.    September 13 the printed copies of the report of the Committee on Style  were ready, and three more days were spent by the convention in  carefully comparing each article and section of this final draft.    On September 15 the work of drafting the Constitution was regarded as  ended, and it was adopted and ordered to be engrossed for signing.    It may be interesting at this point to give the result of their labours  as measured in words, and if the framers of the Constitution deserve the  plaudits of posterity in no other respect they do in the remarkable  self-restraint which those results revealed.    The convention had been in session for 81 continuous days. Probably  they had consumed over 300 hours in debate. If their debates had been  fully reported, they would probably have filled at least fifty volumes,  and yet the net result of their labours consisted of about 4,000 words,  89 sentences, and about 140 distinct provisions. As the late Lord Bryce,  speaking in this age of unbridled expression, both oral and printed, so  well has said:        \"The Constitution of the United States, including the amendments,      may be read aloud in twenty-three minutes. It is about half as long      as Saint Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, and one-fourth as long      as the Irish Land Act of 1881. History knows few instruments which      in so few words lay down equally momentous rules on a vast range of      matters of the highest importance and complexity.\"    Even including the nineteen amendments, the Constitution, after one  hundred and thirty-five years of development, does not exceed 7,000  words. What admirable self-restraint! Possibly single opinions of the  Supreme Court could be cited which are as long as the whole document of  which they are interpreting a single phrase. This does not argue that  the Constitution is an obscure document, for it would be difficult to  cite any political document in the annals of mankind that was so simple  and lucid in expression. There is nothing Johnsonese about its style.  Every word is a word of plain speech, the ordinary meaning of which even  the man in the street knows. No tautology is to be found and no attempt  at ornate expression. It is a model of simplicity, and as it flows  through the reaches of history it will always excite the admiration of  those who love clarity and not rhetorical excesses. One can say of it as  Horace said of his favourite Spring:      _O, fons Bandusiae, splendidior vitro.    Dulce digne mero, non sine floribus_.    If I be asked why, if this be true, it has required many lengthy  opinions of the Supreme Court in the 256 volumes of its Reports to  interpret its meaning, the answer is that, as with the simple sayings of  the great Galilean, whose words have likewise been the subject of  unending commentary, the question is not one of clarity but of  adaptation of the meaning to the ever-changing conditions of human life.  Moreover, as with the sayings of the Master or the unequalled verse of  Shakespeare, questions of construction are more due to the commentators  than to the text itself.    On September 17 the convention met for the last time. The document was  engrossed and laid before the members for signature. Of the fifty-five  members who had attended, only thirty-nine remained. Of those, a number  were unwilling to sign as individuals. While the members had not been  unconscious of the magnitude of their labours, they were quite  insensible of the magnitude of their achievement. Few there were of the  convention who were enthusiastic about this result. Indeed, as the  document was ready for signature, it became a grave question whether the  remnant which remained had sufficient faith in their own work to  subscribe their names, and if they failed to do so its adoption by the  people would have been impossible. It was then that Doctor Franklin  rendered one of the last and greatest services of his life. With  ingratiating wit and with all the impressiveness that his distinguished  career inspired, Franklin thus spoke:        \"I confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which I      do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve      them. For having lived long I have experienced many instances of      being obliged by better information or fuller consideration, to      change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought      right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I      grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment and to pay more      respect to the judgment of others. Most men indeed as well as most      sects in religion think themselves in possession of all truth, and      that wherever others differ from them it is so far error. Steele, a      Protestant, in a dedication tells the Pope that the only difference      between our Churches in their opinions of the certainty of their      doctrines is, the Church of Rome is infallible and the Church of      England is never in the wrong. But though many private persons think      almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their      sect, few express it so naturally as a certain French lady, who in a      dispute with her sister, said: 'I don't know how it happens, sister,      but I meet with nobody but myself that's always in the right.'--_Il      n'y a que moi qui a toujours raison_.        \"In these sentiments, sir, I agree to this Constitution with all      its faults, if they are such; because I think a general government      necessary for us, and there is no form of government but what may be      a blessing to the people, if well administered, and I believe      further that this is likely to be well administered for a course of      years, and can only end in despotism as other forms have done before      it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic      government, being incapable of any other. I doubt, too, whether any      other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better      Constitution. For when you assemble a number of men to have the      advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble with those      men all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion,      their local interests, and their selfish views. From such an      assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore      astonishes me, sir, to find this system approaching so near to      perfection as it does.... Thus, I consent, sir, to this Constitution      because I expect no better, and because I am not sure that it is not      the best. The opinions I have had of its errors I sacrifice to the      public good, I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad.      Within these walls they were born and here they shall die. If every      one of us in returning to our constituents were to report the      objections he has had to it and endeavour to gain partisans in      support of them, we might prevent its being generally received, and      thereby lost all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting      naturally in our favour among foreign nations as well as among      ourselves from our real or apparent unanimity.        \"On the whole, sir, I cannot help expressing a wish that every      member of the convention who may still have objections to it, would      with me, on this occasion doubt a little of his own      infallibility--and to make manifest our unanimity, put his name to      this instrument.\"    Truly this spirit of Doctor Franklin could be profitably invoked in this  day and generation, when nations are so intolerant of the ideas of other  nations.    As the members, moved by Franklin's humorous and yet moving appeal, came  forward to subscribe their names, Franklin drew the attention of some of  the members to the fact that on the back of the President's chair was  the half disk of a sun, and, with his love of metaphor, he said that  painters had often found it difficult to distinguish in their art a  rising from a setting"]]]
