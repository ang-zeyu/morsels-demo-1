The hydrogen engendered during the electrolysis is disengaged through an  aperture in the cover of the pile.    As a measure of precaution, the hydrogen saturated with alcoholic vapors  may be forced to traverse a small, cooled room. The liquefied alcohol  returns to the pile. At a mean temperature of 15 deg., the quantity of  alcohol carried along mechanically is insignificant. In order to secure  a uniformity of action in all parts of the spirits, during the period  devoted to the operation, the liquid is made to circulate from top to  bottom by means of a pump, O. The tube, N, indicates the level of the  liquid in the vessel. The zinc having been arranged, the first operation  consists in forming the couple. This is done by introducing into the  pile, by means of the pump, O, a solution of sulphate of copper so as to  completely fill it.    The adherence of the copper to the zinc is essential to a proper working  of the couple, and may be obtained by observing the following  conditions:    1. Impure spirits of 40 deg. Gay-Lussac, and not water, should be used as a  menstruum for the salt of copper.    2. The sulphatization should be operated by five successive solutions of  1/2 per cent., representing 20 kilogrammes of sulphate of copper per 100  square meters of zinc exposed, or a total of 360 kilogrammes of sulphate  for a pile of 150 hectoliters capacity.    3. A temperature of 25 deg. should not be exceeded during the  sulphatization.    The use of spirits is justified by the fact that the presence of the  alcohol notably retards the precipitation of copper. As each charging  with copper takes twenty-four hours, it requires five days to form the  pile. At the end of this time the deposit should be of a chocolate-brown  and sufficiently adherent; but the adherence becomes much greater after  a fortnight's operation.    Temperature has a marked influence upon the rapidity and continuity of  the reaction. Below +5 deg. the couple no longer works, and above +35 deg. the  reaction becomes vigorous and destroys the adherence of the copper to  such a degree that it becomes necessary to sulphatize the pile anew. The  battery is kept up by adding every eight days a few thousandths of  hydrochloric acid to a vatful of the spirits under treatment, say 5  kilos. of acid to 150 hectoliters of spirits. The object of adding this  acid is to dissolve the hydrate of oxide of zinc formed during the  electrolysis and deposited in a whitish stratum upon the surface of the  copper. The pile required no attention, and it is capable of operating  from 18 months to two years without being renewed or cleaned.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--ELECTROLYZING APPARATUS.]    Passing them over, the zinc-copper couple does not suffice to deodorize  the impure spirits, so they must be sent directly to a rectifier. But,  in certain cases, it is necessary to follow up the treatment by the pile  with another one by electrolysis. The voltameters in which this second  operation is performed have likewise been modified. They consist now  (Fig. 2) of cylindrical glass vessels, AH, 125 mm. in diameter by 600 in  height, with polished edges. These are hermetically closed by an ebonite  cover through which pass the tubes, B' C' and B C, that allow the  liquid, E+E-E'+E', to circulate.    The current of spirits is regulated at the entrance by the cock, R,  which, through its division plate, gives the exact discharge per hour.  In addition, in order to secure great regularity in the flow, there is  placed between the voltameters and the reservoir that supplies them a  second and constant level reservoir regulated by an automatic cock.    In practice, Mr. Naudin employs 12 voltameters that discharge 12  hectoliters per hour, for a distillery that handles 300 hectoliters of  impure spirits every 24 hours. The electric current is furnished to the  voltameters by a Siemens machine (Fig. 3) having inductors in  derivation, the intensity being regulated by the aid of resistance wires  interposed in the circuit of the inductors.    The current is made to pass into the series of voltameters by means of a  commutator, and its intensity is shown by a Deprez galvanometer. The  voltameters, as shown in the diagram, are mounted in derivation in  groups of two in tension. The spirits traverse them in two parallel  currents. The Siemens machine is of the type SD2, and revolves at the  rate of 1,200 times per minute, absorbing a motive power of four horses.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--ARRANGEMENT OF THE SIEMENS MACHINE.]    The disacidification, before entering the rectifier, is effected by the  metallic zinc. Let us now examine what economic advantages this process  presents over the old method of rectifying by pure and simple  distillation. The following are the data given by Mr. Naudin:    In ordinary processes (1) a given quantity of impure alcohol must  undergo five rectifications in order that the products composing the  mixture (pure alcohol, oils, etc.) may be separated and sold according  to their respective quality; (2) the mean yield in the first  distillation does not exceed 60 cent.; (3) the loss experienced in  distillation amounts, for each rectification, to 4 per cent.; (4) the  quantity of essential oils (mixture of the homologues of ethylic  alcohol) collected at the end of the first distillation equals, on an  average, 3.5 per cent.; (5) the cost of a rectification may be estimated  at, on an average, 4 francs per hectoliter.    All things being equal, the yield in the first operation by the electric  method is 80 per cent., and the treatment costs, on an average, 0.40  franc per hectoliter. The economy that is realized is therefore  considerable. For an establishment in which 150 hectoliters of 100 deg.  alcohol are treated per day this saving becomes evident, amounting, as  it does, to 373 francs.    We may add that the electric process permits of rectifying spirits  which, up to the present, could not be rectified by the ordinary  processes. Mr. Naudin's experiments have shown, for example, that  artichoke spirits, which could not be utilized by the old processes,  give through hydrogenation an alcohol equal to that derived from Indian  corn.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *          PLASTIC CARBON FOR BATTERIES.      Max Nitsche-Niesky recommends the following in _Neueste Erfindung_.:  Good coke is ground and mixed with coal-tar to a stiff dough and pressed  into moulds made of iron and brass. After drying for a few days in a  closed place, it is heated in a furnace where it is protected from the  direct flames and burned, feebly at first, then strongly, the fire being  gradually raised to white heat which is maintained for 6 or 8 hours. The  fire is then permitted to slowly go down, and when perfectly cold the  carbon is taken out of the furnace.           *       *       *       *       *          RECENT STUDIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ALKALOIDS.    By SAMUEL P. SADTLER, Ph.D.    [Footnote: Introductory lecture, Course of 1883-84, Philadelphia College  of Pharmacy.]      The sciences of to-day present, as might be expected, a very different  aspect from the same branches of knowledge as they appeared fifty or  sixty years ago. It is not merely that the mass of observations in most  of these lines of study has enormously increased during this interval.  Were that all, the change could hardly be considered as an unmixed  benefit, because of the increased difficulty of assimilation of this  additional matter. Many would be the contradictions in the observations  and hopeless would be the task of bringing order out of such a chaos.  The advance in the several branches of knowledge has been largely one  resulting from improved methods of study, rather than one following  simply from diligence in the application of the old ways.    Let us turn to chemistry for our illustration of this. The chemistry of  the last century and the early decades of this was largely a descriptive  science, such as the natural history branches, zoology, and botany are  still in great part. Reasonably exact mineral analyses were made, it is  true, but the laws of chemical combination and the fundamental  conceptions of atoms and molecules had not been as yet generally  established. Now, this want of comprehensive views of chemical  reactions, their why and wherefore, was bad enough as it affected the  study of inorganic and metallic compounds, but what must have been the  conditions for studying the complex compounds of carbon, so widely  spread in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. Their number is so enormous  that, in the absence of any established relationships, not much more  than a mere enumeration was possible for the student of this branch of  chemistry. It is only within the last twenty years that chemists have  attained to any comprehensive views at all in the domain of organic  chemistry. It has been found possible to gradually range most carbon  compounds under two categories, either as marsh-gas or as benzol  derivatives, as fatty compounds or as aromatic compounds. To do this,  methods of analysis very different from those used in mineral chemistry  had to be applied. The mere finding out of percentage composition tells  us little or nothing about an organic compound. What the elements are  that compose the compound is not to be found out. That can be told  beforehand with almost absolute certainty. What is wanted is to know how  the atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are linked together,  for, strange to say, these differences of groupings, which may be found  to exist between these three or four elements, endow the compounds with  radically different properties and serve us as a basis of  classification.    The development of this part of chemistry, therefore, required very  different methods of research. Instead of at once destroying a compound  in order to learn of what elements it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#11)"],[1," the policy of other  States the power of the particular State is threatened, and peaceful  methods are insufficient to secure its integrity. This power, as we saw,  rests on a material basis, but finds expression in ethical values. War  therefore seems imperative when, although the material basis of power is  not threatened, the moral influence of the State (and this is the  ultimate point at issue) seems to be prejudiced. Thus apparently  trifling causes may under certain circumstances constitute a fully  justifiable _casus belli_ if the honour of the State, and consequently  its moral prestige, are endangered. This prestige is an essential part  of its power. An antagonist must never be allowed to believe that there  is any lack of determination to assert this prestige, even if the sword  must be drawn to do so.    In deciding for war or peace, the next important consideration is  whether the question under discussion is sufficiently vital for the  power of the State to justify the determination to fight; whether the  inevitable dangers and miseries of a war do not threaten to inflict  greater injury on the interests of the State than the disadvantages  which, according to human calculation, must result if war is not  declared. A further point to be considered is whether the general  position of affairs affords some reasonable prospect of military  success. With these considerations of expediency certain other weighty  aspects of the question must also be faced.    It must always be kept in mind that a State is not justified in looking  only to the present, and merely consulting the immediate advantage of  the existing generation. Such policy would be opposed to all that  constitutes the essential nature of the State. Its conduct must be  guided by the moral duties incumbent on it, which, as one step is  gained, point to the next higher, and prepare the present for the  future. \"The true greatness of the State is that it links the past with  the present and the future; consequently the individual has no right to  regard the State as a means for attaining his own ambitions in life.\" [L]    [Footnote L: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p 3.]    The law of development thus becomes a leading factor in politics, and in  the decision for war this consideration must weigh more heavily than the  sacrifices necessarily to be borne in the present. \"I cannot conceive,\"  Zelter once wrote to Goethe, \"how any right deed can be performed  without sacrifice; all worthless actions must lead to the very opposite  of what is desirable.\"    A second point of view which must not be neglected is precisely that  which Zelter rightly emphasizes. A great end cannot be attained except  by staking large intellectual and material resources, and no certainty  of success can ever be anticipated. Every undertaking implies a greater  or less venture. The daily intercourse of civic life teaches us this  lesson; and it cannot be otherwise in politics where account must be  taken of most powerful antagonists whose strength can only be vaguely  estimated. In questions of comparatively trifling importance much may be  done by agreements and compromises, and mutual concessions may produce a  satisfactory status. The solution of such problems is the sphere of  diplomatic activity. The state of things is quite different when vital  questions are at issue, or when the opponent demands concession, but  will guarantee none, and is clearly bent on humiliating the other party.  Then is the time for diplomatists to be silent and for great statesmen  to act. Men must be resolved to stake everything, and cannot shun the  solemn decision of war. In such questions any reluctance to face the  opponent, every abandonment of important interests, and every attempt at  a temporizing settlement, means not only a momentary loss of political  prestige, and frequently of real power, which may possibly be made good  in another place, but a permanent injury to the interests of the State,  the full gravity of which is only felt by future generations.    Not that a rupture of pacific relations must always result in such a  case. The mere threat of war and the clearly proclaimed intention to  wage it, if necessary, will often cause the opponent to give way. This  intention must, however, be made perfectly plain, for \"negotiations  without arms are like music-books without instruments,\" as Frederick the  Great said. It is ultimately the actual strength of a nation to which  the opponent's purpose yields. When, therefore, the threat of war is  insufficient to call attention to its own claims the concert must begin;  the obligation is unconditional, and the _right_ to fight becomes the  _duty_ to make war, incumbent on the nation and statesman alike.    Finally, there is a third point to be considered. Cases may occur where  war must be made simply as a point of honour, although there is no  prospect of success. The responsibility of this has also to be borne. So  at least Frederick the Great thought. His brother Henry, after the  battle of Kolin, had advised him to throw himself at the feet of the  Marquise de Pompadour in order to purchase a peace with France. Again,  after the battle of Kunersdorf his position seemed quite hopeless, but  the King absolutely refused to abandon the struggle. He knew better what  suited the honour and the moral value of his country, and preferred to  die sword in hand than to conclude a degrading peace. President  Roosevelt, in his message to the Congress of the United States of  America on December 4, 1906, gave expression to a similar thought. \"It  must ever be kept in mind,\" so the manly and inspiriting words ran,  \"that war is not merely justifiable, but imperative, upon honourable men  and upon an honourable nation when peace is only to be obtained by the  sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of national welfare. A just war  is in the long-run far better for a nation's soul than the most  prosperous peace obtained by an acquiescence in wrong or injustice....  It must be remembered that even to be defeated in war may be better than  not to have fought at all.\"    To sum up these various views, we may say that expediency in the higher  sense must be conclusive in deciding whether to undertake a war in  itself morally justifiable. Such decision is rendered more easy by the  consideration that the prospects of success are always the greatest when  the moment for declaring war can be settled to suit the political and  military situation.    It must further be remembered that every success in foreign policy,  especially if obtained by a demonstration of military strength, not only  heightens the power of the State in foreign affairs, but adds to the  reputation of the Government at home, and thus enables it better to  fulfil its moral aims and civilizing duties.    No one will thus dispute the assumption that, under certain  circumstances, it is the moral and political duty of the State to employ  war as a political means. So long as all human progress and all natural  development are based on the law of conflict, it is necessary to engage  in such conflict under the most favourable conditions possible.    When a State is confronted by the material impossibility of supporting  any longer the warlike preparations which the power of its enemies has  forced upon it, when it is clear that the rival States must gradually  acquire from natural reasons a lead that cannot be won back, when there  are indications of an offensive alliance of stronger enemies who only  await the favourable moment to strike--the moral duty of the State  towards its citizens is to begin the struggle while the prospects of  success and the political circumstances are still tolerably favourable.  When, on the other hand, the hostile States are weakened or hampered by  affairs at home and abroad, but its own warlike strength shows elements  of superiority, it is imperative to use the favourable circumstances to  promote its own political aims. The danger of a war may be faced the  more readily if there is good prospect that great results may be  obtained with comparatively small sacrifices.    These obligations can only be met by a vigorous, resolute, active  policy, which follows definite ideas, and understands how to arouse and  concentrate all the living forces of the State, conscious of the truth  of Schiller's lines:      \"The chance that once thou hast refused    Will never through the centuries recur.\"    The verdict of history will condemn the statesman who was unable to take  the responsibility of a bold decision, and sacrificed the hopes of the  future to the present need of peace.    It is obvious that under these circumstances it is extremely difficult  to answer the question whether in any special case conditions exist  which justify the determination to make war. The difficulty is all the  greater because the historical significance of the act must be  considered, and the immediate result is not the final criterion of its  justification.    War is not always the final judgment of Heaven. There are successes  which are transitory while the national life is reckoned by centuries.  The ultimate verdict can only be obtained by the survey of long  epochs.[M]    [Footnote M: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p 2.]  54  The man whose high and responsible lot is to steer the fortunes of a  great State must be able to disregard the verdict of his contemporaries;  but he must be all the clearer as to the motives of his own policy, and  keep before his eyes, with the full weight of the categorical  imperative, the teaching of Kant: \"Act so that the maxim of thy will can  at the same time hold good as a principle of universal legislation.\" [N]    [Footnote N: Kant, \"Kritik der praktischen Vernuft,\" p. 30.]    He must have a clear conception of the nature and purpose of the State,  and grasp this from the highest moral standpoint.
