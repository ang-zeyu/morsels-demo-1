Possibly the cloud will be drawn bodily toward the earth more or less  rapidly, according as the charge is great or small. Or, on the other hand,  the cloud may roll on for leagues, carrying its influence with it, so that  the various portions of the earth underneath become successively charged  and discharged as the cloud progresses on its journey.    [Footnote 3: We may speak of two electricities or two electric states  without necessarily implying adherence either to the single or the double  \"fluid\" theory. Whether electricity be of two kinds or no, the fact  remains that there are two conditions, and all the features of this paper  may be explained with equal facility by the supporters of either  hypothesis.]    Should the cloud be near the earth, or should it be very highly charged,  the tension of the two electricities may be so great as to overcome the  resistance of the intervening air; and if this resistance should prove too  weak, what happens? How does the discharge show itself? It takes place in  the form of a lightning flash, and passing from the one surface to the  other--or, maybe, simultaneously from both--produces neutrality more or  less complete.    There has recently been a little discussion in these pages on the subject  of lightning, some having stated that they discerned the discharge to take  place upward--that is, from the earth toward the cloud. I will not venture  so far as to say whether or not the direction of the discharge is  discernible; possibly the flash may sometimes be long enough to enable one  to tell; but I have never so seen it, and have always looked upon the eye  as a deceitful member--very. \"The lightning flash itself never lasts more  than 1/100000 of a second.\" It is, however, just as likely that a  discharge may travel upward as downward. What controls the discharge? Does  the quality of the charge?--that is to say, is the positive or the  negative more prone to break disruptively through the insulating medium?  Investigations with Geissler's and other tubes containing highly rarefied  gases have made it tolerably clear that there is a greater \"tearing away\"  influence at the negative than at the positive pole, and if two equal  balls, containing one a positive and the other a negative charge, be  equally heated, the negative is more readily dissipated than the positive.  But, so far as we at present know, this question enters into the  discussion scarcely, if at all. Our knowledge seems rather to point to the  substances upon which the charges are collected. The self-repellent nature  of electricity compels it to manifest itself at the more prominent parts  of the surface, the level being forsaken for the point. The tension of the  charge, or its tendency to fly off, is proportionately increased. And if  at a given moment the tension attains a certain intensity, the discharge  follows, emanating from the surface which offers the greatest facilities  for escape. The earth is generally flatter than the cloud, whence, in all  probability, the discharge more frequently originates with the cloud.    Should a lightning flash strike the earth and produce direct neutrality,  it is possible that no damage will result, although this again is not  always certain, because when the cloud charge acts inductively on the  earth it produces the opposite (say negative) charge on the nearer parts,  the similar (or positive) state is also produced at some place more or  less distant. Sometimes this \"freed\" positive (which, by the way,  accumulates gradually and physiologically imperceptibly) is collected at  some portion of the earth's surface. When the negative is neutralized by  the discharge, the freed positive is no longer confined to a particular  region, but tends to dissipate itself, and a shock may be felt more or  less severely by any person within the region. Or, again, a similar shock  may be experienced by a person standing within the negative zone on the  neutralization of the charge.    I may take the opportunity here to mention a highly interesting and  instructive incident observed on local telegraph circuits during a  thunderstorm. The storm may be taking place at some distance from the  point of observation. The electrified cloud induces the opposite charge  beneath it, the similar charge being repelled. It is noticeable that the  needle of a galvanometer, starting from the middle position, goes  gradually over to one side, eventually indicating a considerable  deflection. Suddenly, owing apparently to a lightning discharge some  distance away, the force which caused the deflection is withdrawn, and the  needle rebounds with great violence to the opposite side. In a short time,  the cloud becoming again charged on its under surface, and recommencing  its inductive effect upon the adjacent earth, the needle starts again, and  goes through the same series of movements, a violent counterthrow  following every flash of lightning.    If we can so far control our imagination, we may conceive the earth to be  one large insulated conductor, susceptible to every influence around it.  If then the earth, as a mass of matter, behaves as above indicated, there  is no plausible reason for declining to regard any other large conducting  mass in a similar light, and as a body capable of being subjected more or  less completely to the various impulses affecting the earth. In other  words, a large mass of conducting material, partially or perfectly  insulated, is, during a thunderstorm, in considerable danger. With this  portion of the subject I shall, however, deal more fully when discussing  the merits of lightning protectors.    Lightning discharges do not take place between cloud and earth only, but  also, and perhaps more frequently, between too oppositely charged clouds.  We then get atmospheric lightning, the flash often extending for miles.  This form of lightning is harmless, and in all probability what we see is  only a reflection of the discharge. The oft-told tale of the lightning  flying in at the window, across the room, and out of the door, or up the  chimney, is all moonshine, and before dealing with lightning protectors I  intend to expose some of the fallacies concerning lightning. Were the  discharge to pass through a house, it would infallibly leave more decided  traces and do more damage than simply scaring a superstitious old lady now  and again. Many people are often and unnecessarily frightened during a  thunderstorm, but it may be safely predicted that a person under a roof is  infinitely safer than one who is standing alone on level ground, and  making himself a prominence inviting a discharge. Rain almost invariably  accompanies the discharge, and the roof and sides of the house being wet,  they form a more or less perfect channel of escape should a flash strike  the building.--_Knowledge._           *       *       *       *       *          RESEARCHES ON MAGNETISM.    By M. DUTER.      If we place a thin plate of steel in a uniform magnetic field, so that the  lines of force of the field may be normal to the surface of the plate, we  have a very flat magnet, the two faces of which are the two polar  surfaces. The magnetic distribution thus obtained seems to disappear when  the plate is no longer in the field. The following experiments show that  this disappearance is not complete. I made use of plates of tempered steel  of 1 millimeter in thickness, and varying in diameter from 0.040 to 0.005  meter. With these plates I formed cylindrical batteries. In some of these  batteries the plates are directly in contact, and in others they were  separated by leaves of pasteboard, the thickness of which varied from that  of the thinnest paper to 0.001 meter. The batteries were placed in the  central portion of a very powerful magnetic field, and after they have  been taken out they formed perfectly regular permanent magnets. The  supporting power of these magnets was the greater the nearer its  constituent plates were to each other. In a battery of 100 plates,  touching each other directly, and strongly pressed into a brass cylinder,  the portative force at each extremity rose to 30 grammes. This first  result having been obtained, I dismounted the batteries, plate by plate,  taking care to mark the upper and under side of each. I found then that  each plate retained only an excessively slight magnetism. Yet each of them  still constituted a flat magnet, of which the two faces are the polar  surfaces; for on rebuilding the battery it gave again a perfectly regular  magnet, though weaker than it was at first. The separation of the magnet  into its constituent plates, and its reconstruction, maybe repeated  indefinitely.--_Comptes Rendus._           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. T.

Nevertheless, the economy has encountered  major problems in recent years, leading to a recession in 1988-89.  Economic growth slowed to 2.0% in 1987 and to - 1.8% in 1988; a sharp  decline of - 5.5% has been estimated for 1989. A widening public-sector  deficit and a multidigit inflation rate has dominated the  economy over the past three years, reaching about 5,000% in 1989.  Since 1978, Argentina's external debt has nearly doubled to $60  billion, creating severe debt-servicing difficulties and hurting  the country's creditworthiness with international lenders.
