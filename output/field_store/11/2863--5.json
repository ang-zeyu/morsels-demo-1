Young Goethe  conceived his hero differently: not as a bad man on the way to hell,  and not--at first--as a good man on the way to heaven. He thought of  him rather as a towering personality passionately athirst for  transcendental knowledge and universal experience; as a man whose  nature contained the very largest possibilities both for good and for  evil. It is probable that, when he began to write, Goethe did not  intend to anticipate the judgment of God upon Faust's career. The  essence of his dramatic plan was to carry his hero through a lifetime  of varied experience, letting him sin and suffer grandly, and at last  to give him something to do which would seem worth having lived for.  After the going down of the curtain, in all probability, he was to be  left in the hands of the Eternal Pardoner. Later in life, as we shall  see, Goethe decided not only to save his hero, but to make his  salvation a part of the dramatic action.    The close of the year 1775 brought a momentous change in Goethe's life  and prospects. On the invitation of the young duke Karl August, who  had met him and taken a liking to him, he went to visit the Weimar  court, not expecting to stay more than a few weeks. But the duke was  so pleased with his gifted and now famous guest that he presently  decided to keep him in Weimar, if possible, by making him a member of  the Council of State. Goethe was the more willing to remain, since he  detested his law practise, and his income from authorship was  pitifully small. Moreover, he saw in the boyish, impulsive,  sport-loving prince a sterling nature that might be led in the ways of  wise rulership. For the nonce this was mission enough. He took his  seat in the Council in June, 1776, with the title of Councilor of  Legation. At first there was not very much for him to do except to  familiarize himself with the physical and economic conditions of the  little duchy. This he did with a will. He set about studying  mineralogy, geology, botany, and was soon observing the homologies of  the vertebrate skeleton. Withal he was very attentive to  routine business.    [Illustration: 1. GOETHE'S GARDEN HOUSE IN WEIMAR]    [Illustration: 2. GOETHE'S HOUSE IN WEIMAR]    One after another important departments of administration were turned  over to him, until he became, in 1782, the President of the Chambers  and hence the leading statesman of the duchy.    All this produced a sobering and clarifying effect. The inner storm  and stress gradually subsided, and the new Goethe--statesman,  scientific investigator, man of the world, courtier, friend of  princes--came to see that after all feeling was not everything, and  that its untrammeled expression was not the whole of art. Form and  decorum counted for more than he had supposed, and revolution was not  the word of wisdom. Self-control was the only basis of character, and  limitation lay at the foundation of all art. To work to make things  better, even in a humble sphere, was better than to fret over the  badness of the world. Nature's method was that of bit-by-bit progress,  and to puzzle out her ways was a noble and fascinating employment. In  this general way of thinking he was confirmed by the study of  Spinoza's _Ethics_, a book which, as he said long afterwards, quieted  his passions and gave him a large and free outlook over the world. In  this process of quieting the passions some influence must be ascribed  to Charlotte von Stein, a woman in whom, for some twelve years of his  life, he found his muse and his madonna. His letters often address her  in terms of idolatrous endearment. She was a wife and a mother, but  Weimar society regarded her relation to Goethe as a platonic  attachment not to be condemned.    The artistic expression of the new life in Weimar is found in various  short poems, notably _Wanderer's Nightsong_, _Ilmenau_, _The Divine_,  and _The Mysteries_; also in a number of plays which were written for  the amateur stage of the court circle. The Weimarians were very fond  of play-acting, and Goethe became their purveyor of dramatic supplies.  It was to meet this demand that he wrote _Brother and Sister (Die  Geschwister), The Triumph of Sentimentalism, The Fisher-maid, The  Birds_, and other pieces. Much more important than any of these  bagatelles, which were often hastily composed for a birthday  celebration or some other festive occasion, are the two fine poetic  dramas, _Iphigenie_ and _Tasso_. The former was first written rather  rapidly in stately rhythmic prose and played by the amateurs, with  Goethe himself in the role of Orestes, in the spring of 1779. Eight  years later, the author being then in Italy, it was recast with great  care in mellifluous blank verse. _Iphigenie_ is essentially a drama of  the soul, there being little in it of what is commonly called action.  A youth who is the prey of morbid illusions, so that his life has  become a burden, is cured by finding a noble-minded sister, whose  whole being radiates peace and self-possession. The entire power of  Goethe's chastened art is here lavished on the figure of his heroine  who, by her goodness, her candor, her sweet reasonableness, not only  heals her soul-sick brother, but so works on the barbarian king Thoas,  who would fain have her for his wife, that he wins a notable victory  over himself.    By the end of his first decade in Weimar Goethe began to feel that he  needed and had earned a vacation. His conduct of the public business  had been highly successful, but he had starved his esthetic nature;  for after all Weimar was only a good-sized village that could offer  little to the lover of art. Overwork had so told upon him that he was  unable to hold himself long to any literary project. He had begun half  a dozen important works, but had completed none of them, and the  public was beginning to suspect that the author of _Goetz_ and  _Werther_ was lost to literature. The effect of the whole  situation--that inner conflict between the poetic dreamer and the man  of affairs which is the theme of _Tasso_--was to produce a feeling of  depression, as of a bird caught in a net. So acute did the trouble  become that he afterwards spoke of it as a terrible disease. In the  summer of 1786 he contracted with the Leipzig publisher Goeschen for a  new edition of his works in eight volumes; and to gain time for this  enterprise he resolved to take a trip to the land upon which he had  already twice looked down with longing--once in 1775 and again in  1779--from the summit of the Gotthard.    [Illustration: GOETHE IN THE CAMPAGNA]    On the 3d of September, at three o'clock in the morning, he stole away  from Karlsbad, where he had been taking the waters, and hurried  southward, alone and incognito, over the Alps.    In Italy, where he remained nearly two years, Goethe's mind and art  underwent another notable change. He himself called it a spiritual  rebirth. Freed from all oppressive engagements, he gave himself to the  study of ancient sculpture and architecture, reveled in the splendors  of Renaissance painting, and pursued his botanical studies in the  enticing plant-world of the Italian gardens. Venice, Naples, Vesuvius,  Sicily, the sea, fascinated him in their several ways and gave him the  sense of being richer for the rest of his life. Sharing in the  care-free existence of the German artist-colony in Rome made him very  happy. It not only disciplined his judgment in matters of art and  opened a vast new world of ideas and impressions, but it restored the  lost balance between the intellectual and duty-bound man on the one  hand and the esthetic and sensual man on the other. He resolved never  again to put on the harness of an administrative drudge, but to claim  the freedom of a poet, an artist, a man of science. To this desire the  Duke of Weimar generously assented.    On his return to Weimar, in June, 1788, Goethe made it his first task  to finish the remaining works that were called for by his contract  with Goeschen. _Egmont_ and _Tasso_ were soon disposed of, but _Faust_  proved intractable. While in Rome he had taken out the old manuscript  and written a scene or two, and had then somehow lost touch with the  subject. So he decided to revise what he had on hand and to publish a  part of the scenes as a fragment. This fragmentary _Faust_ came out in  1790. It attracted little attention, nor was any other of the new  works received with much warmth by the public of that day. They  expected something like _Goetz_ and _Werther_, and did not understand  the new Goethe, who showed in many ways that his heart was still in  Italy and that he found Weimar a little dull and provincial. Thus the  greatest of German poets had for the time being lost touch with the  German public; he saw that he must wait for the growth of the taste by  which he was to be understood and enjoyed. Matters were hardly made  better by his taking Christiane Vulpius into his house as his unwedded  wife. This step, which shocked Weimar society--except the duke and  Herder--had the effect of ending his unwholesome relation to Frau von  Stein, who was getting old and peevish. The character of Christiane  has often been pictured too harshly. She was certainly not her  husband's intellectual peer--he would have looked long for a wife of  that grade--and she became a little too fond of wine. On the other  hand, she was affectionate, devoted, true, and by no means lacking in  mental gifts. She and Goethe were happy together and faithful to  each other.    For several years after his return from Italy Goethe wrote nothing  that is of much importance in the history of his literary life. He  devoted himself largely to scientific studies in plant and animal  morphology and the theory of color. His discovery of the  intermaxillary bone in the human skull, and his theory that the  lateral organs of a plant are but successive phases of the leaf, have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#11)"],[1,"from Miss Gibson, \"I have a  good deal to do with signatures, cheques and disputed documents of  various kinds. Now a skilled eye, aided by a pocket-lens, can make out  very minute details on a cheque or bank-note; but it is not possible to  lend one's skilled eye to a judge or juryman, so that it is often very  convenient to be able to hand them a photograph in which the  magnification is already done, which they can compare with the original.  Small things, when magnified, develop quite unexpected characters; for  instance, you have handled a good many postage stamps, I suppose, but  have you ever noticed the little white spots in the upper corner of a  penny stamp, or even the difference in the foliage on the two sides of  the wreath?\"    Miss Gibson admitted that she had not.    \"Very few people have, I suppose, excepting stamp-collectors,\" continued  Thorndyke; \"but now just glance at this and you will find these  unnoticed details forced upon your attention.\" As he spoke, he handed  her a photograph, which he had taken from a drawer, showing a penny  stamp enlarged to a length of eight inches.    While the ladies were marvelling over this production, Polton proceeded  with his work. The \"Thumbograph\" having been fixed in position, the  light from a powerful incandescent gas lamp, fitted with a parabolic  reflector, was concentrated on it, and the camera racked out to its  proper distance.    \"What are those figures intended to show?\" inquired Miss Gibson,  indicating the graduation on the side of one of the guides.    \"They show the amount of magnification or reduction,\" Thorndyke  explained. \"When the pointer is opposite 0, the photograph is the same  size as the object photographed; when it points to, say, x 4, the  photograph will be four times the width and length of the object, while  if it should point to, say, / 4, the photograph will be one-fourth the  length of the object. It is now, you see, pointing to x 8, so the  photograph will be eight times the diameter of the original thumb-mark.\"    By this time Polton had brought the camera to an accurate focus and,  when we had all been gratified by a glimpse of the enlarged image on the  focussing screen, we withdrew to a smaller room which was devoted to  bacteriology and microscopical research, while the exposure was made and  the plate developed. Here, after an interval, we were joined by Polton,  who bore with infinite tenderness the dripping negative on which could  be seen the grotesque transparency of a colossal thumb-mark.    This Thorndyke scrutinised eagerly, and having pronounced it  satisfactory, informed Mrs. Hornby that the object of her visit was  attained, and thanked her for the trouble she had taken.    \"I am very glad we came,\" said Miss Gibson to me, as a little later we  walked slowly up Mitre Court in the wake of Mrs. Hornby and Thorndyke;  \"and I am glad to have seen these wonderful instruments, too. It has  made me realise that something is being done and that Dr. Thorndyke  really has some object in view. It has really encouraged me immensely.\"    \"And very properly so,\" I replied. \"I, too, although I really know  nothing of what my colleague is doing, feel very strongly that he would  not take all this trouble and give up so much valuable time if he had  not some very definite purpose and some substantial reasons for taking  a hopeful view.\"    \"Thank you for saying that,\" she rejoined warmly; \"and you will let me  have a crumb of comfort when you can, won't you?\" She looked in my face  so wistfully as she made this appeal that I was quite moved; and,  indeed, I am not sure that my state of mind at that moment did not fully  justify my colleague's reticence towards me.    However, I, fortunately, had nothing to tell, and so, when we emerged  into Fleet Street to find Mrs. Hornby already ensconced in a hansom, I  could only promise, as I grasped the hand that she offered to me, to see  her again at the earliest opportunity--a promise which my inner  consciousness assured me would be strictly fulfilled.    \"You seem to be on quite confidential terms with our fair friend,\"  Thorndyke remarked, as we strolled back towards his chambers. \"You are  an insinuating dog, Jervis.\"    \"She is very frank and easy to get on with,\" I replied.    \"Yes. A good girl and a clever girl, and comely to look upon withal. I  suppose it would be superfluous for me to suggest that you mind your  eye?\"    \"I shouldn't, in any case, try to cut out a man who is under a cloud,\" I  replied sulkily.    \"Of course you wouldn't; hence the need of attention to the ophthalmic  member. Have you ascertained what Miss Gibson's actual relation is to  Reuben Hornby?\"    \"No,\" I answered.    \"It might be worth while to find out,\" said Thorndyke; and then he  relapsed into silence.          CHAPTER VI    COMMITTED FOR TRIAL      Thorndyke's hint as to the possible danger foreshadowed by my growing  intimacy with Juliet Gibson had come upon me as a complete surprise, and  had, indeed, been resented by me as somewhat of an impertinence.  Nevertheless, it gave me considerable food for meditation, and I  presently began to suspect that the watchful eyes of my observant friend  might have detected something in my manner towards Miss Gibson  suggestive of sentiments that had been unsuspected by myself.    Of course it would be absurd to suppose that any real feeling could have  been engendered by so ridiculously brief an acquaintance. I had only met  the girl three times, and even now, excepting for business relations,  was hardly entitled to more than a bow of recognition. But yet, when I  considered the matter impartially and examined my own consciousness, I  could not but recognise that she had aroused in me an interest which  bore no relation to the part that she had played in the drama that was  so slowly unfolding. She was undeniably a very handsome girl, and her  beauty was of a type that specially appealed to me--full of dignity and  character that gave promise of a splendid middle age. And her  personality was in other ways not less attractive, for she was frank and  open, sprightly and intelligent, and though evidently quite  self-reliant, was in nowise lacking in that womanly softness that so  strongly engages a man's sympathy.    In short, I realised that, had there been no such person as Reuben  Hornby, I should have viewed Miss Gibson with uncommon interest.    But, unfortunately, Reuben Hornby was a most palpable reality, and,  moreover, the extraordinary difficulties of his position entitled him to  very special consideration by any man of honour. It was true that Miss  Gibson had repudiated any feelings towards Reuben other than those of  old-time friendship; but young ladies are not always impartial judges of  their own feelings, and, as a man of the world, I could not but have my  own opinion on the matter--which opinion I believed to be shared by  Thorndyke. The conclusions to which my cogitations at length brought me  were: first, that I was an egotistical donkey, and, second, that my  relations with Miss Gibson were of an exclusively business character and  must in future be conducted on that basis, with the added consideration  that I was the confidential agent, for the time being, of Reuben Hornby,  and in honour bound to regard his interests as paramount.    \"I am hoping,\" said Thorndyke, as he held out his hand for my teacup,  \"that these profound reflections of yours are connected with the Hornby  affair; in which case I should expect to hear that the riddle is solved  and the mystery made plain.\"    \"Why should you expect that?\" I demanded, reddening somewhat, I suspect,  as I met his twinkling eye. There was something rather disturbing in  the dry, quizzical smile that I encountered and the reflection that I  had been under observation, and I felt as much embarrassed as I should  suppose a self-conscious water-flea might feel on finding itself on the  illuminated stage of a binocular microscope.    \"My dear fellow,\" said Thorndyke, \"you have not spoken a word for the  last quarter of an hour; you have devoured your food with the relentless  regularity of a sausage-machine, and you have, from time to time, made  the most damnable faces at the coffee-pot--though there I'll wager the  coffee-pot was even with you, if I may judge by the presentment that it  offers of my own countenance.\"    I roused myself from my reverie with a laugh at Thorndyke's quaint  conceit and a glance at the grotesquely distorted reflection of my face  in the polished silver.    \"I am afraid I _have_ been a rather dull companion this morning,\" I  admitted apologetically.    \"By no means,\" replied Thorndyke, with a grin. \"On the contrary, I have  found you both amusing and instructive, and I only spoke when I had  exhausted your potentialities as a silent entertainer.\"    \"You are pleased to be facetious at my expense,\" said I.    \"Well, the expense was not a very heavy one,\" he retorted. \"I have been  merely consuming a by-product of your mental activity--Hallo! that's  Anstey already.\"    A peculiar knock, apparently delivered with the handle of a  walking-stick on the outer door, was the occasion of this exclamation,  and as Thorndyke sprang up and flung the door open, a clear, musical  voice was borne in, the measured cadences of which proclaimed at once  the trained orator.    \"Hail, learned brother!\" it exclaimed. \"Do I disturb you untimely at  your studies?\" Here our visitor entered the room and looked round  critically. \"'Tis even so,\" he declared. \"Physiological chemistry and  its practical applications appears to be the subject. A physico-chemical  inquiry into the properties of streaky bacon and fried eggs. Do I see  another learned brother?\"    He peered keenly at me through his pince-nez, and I gazed at him in some  embarrassment.    \"This is my friend Jervis, of whom you have heard me speak,\" said  Thorndyke. \"He is with us in this case, you know.\"    \"Th"]]]
