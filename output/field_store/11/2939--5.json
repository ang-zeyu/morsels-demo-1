[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#11)"],[1,"one can go with his armour without much difficulty.\"    From the Algonkin Indians in the neighbourhood of these St. Louis  Rapids, and also from those living near Quebec, Champlain obtained a  good deal of geographical information to add to his own observations.  He was given an idea, more or less correct, of Lake Ontario, the Falls  of Niagara, Lake Erie and Lake Huron, and perhaps also of Lake  Superior, a sea so vast, said the Amerindians, that the sun set on its  horizon. This sheet of water, Champlain calculated, must be 1200 miles  distant to the west, and therefore identical with the \"Mer du sud\"  (Pacific Ocean), which all North-American explorers for three  centuries wished to reach.    After collecting much information about possible copper mines in the  regions north and south of the Lower St. Lawrence, and of silver[8] in  New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, and a terrible story which he more than  half believed about a monster of prodigious size, the _Gougou_,[9]  Champlain set sail for France at the end of August, 1603.    [Footnote 8: Or lead mixed with silver. The local natives used this  ore, which was white when beaten, for their arrowheads.]    [Footnote 9: The Gougou dwelt on the small island of Miscon, to the  east of the Bay of Chaleurs. It had the form of a woman but was about  a hundred feet high. Its habit was to catch and devour men and women,  whom it first placed in a pocket capacious enough to hold a small  ship. Its roarings and hissings could be heard at times coming from  the island of Miscon, where the Gougou lay concealed. Even a  Frenchman, the Sieur Prevert, had heard these noises. Probably this  islet had a whirlpool communicating with a cavern into which fishermen  were sucked by the current.]    In April, 1604, Champlain accompanied the Sieur de Monts (who had  succeeded the dead Amyard de Chastes as head of a chartered  fur-trading association) in a fresh expedition to North America,  together with a hundred and twenty artisans and several noblemen.  They were to occupy the lands of \"Cadie\" (Acadia, Nova Scotia),  Canada, and other places in New France. De Monts thought Tadoussac and  Quebec too cold in wintertime, and preferred the sunnier east coast  regions. He aimed indeed at colonizing what is now New England.    On the way to Nova Scotia, the expedition was nearly wrecked on Sable  Island, about one hundred and twenty miles south of Cape Breton  Island, and noticed there the large red cattle run wild from the bulls  and cows landed on Sable Island by the Portuguese some sixty years  earlier. (The Portuguese of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  deserved well of humanity for the generous way in which they left  cattle, goats, pigs, and rabbits to run wild on desert islands and  serve as provender for shipwrecked mariners like Robinson Crusoe.)  Champlain also speaks of the \"fine large black foxes\" which he and  other voyagers noticed on Sable Island. How they came there is a  mystery, unless the island had once been part of the mainland.    This same Sable Island had been the scene of an extraordinary  experiment at the end of the previous century. In 1598 the Marquis de  la Roche, given a commission to colonize New France, sailed in a small  ship for North America with sixty convicts from French prisons as  colonists. He landed them on Sable Island, and went away to look for  some good site for his colony. But then a storm arose, and his little  ship was literally blown back to France. The convicts, abandoned thus,  built themselves shelters out of the driftwood of wrecks; killed and  ate the cattle and caught fish. They made themselves warm clothes out  of the skins of the seals which frequented the island coast in  thousands. But these convicts quarrelled and fought among themselves  so fiercely that when at last a ship from Normandy came to take them  away, there were only twelve left--twelve shaggy men with long tangled  hair and beards; and, a legend says, in addition a Franciscan monk  who had been landed on the island with them as a kind of missionary or  chaplain, and who had been so heartbroken at their bloody quarrels and  horrible deeds that when the Norman ship arrived to take the castaways  back to France, the Franciscan refused to go with them, believing  himself to be dying and wishing to end his life undisturbed. So he was  left behind. But after the ship had sailed away he slowly mended, grew  well and strong, and cultivated eagerly his little garden. For food he  ate the whelks, mussels, and oysters that were so abundant on the  shore. Occasionally ships (then as now) were wrecked on Sable Island  in stormy weather, and the good monk ministered to the mariners who  reached the shore. Also he was visited, ever and again, by the Breton  fishing boats, which brought him supplies of necessaries and the bread  and wine for celebrating Mass. Long after his death his spirit was  thought to haunt the desolate island.    Champlain and his companions passed on from Sable Island to the  south-east coast of Nova Scotia, noticing as they landed here and  there the abundance of rabbits[10] and sea birds, especially the Great  Auk, of which they killed numbers with sticks, cormorants (whose fishy  eggs they ate with enjoyment), puffins, guillemots, gulls, terns,  scissorbills, divers, ospreys, buzzards, and falcons; and no doubt the  typical American white-tailed sea eagles, ravens, ducks, geese,  curlews, herons, and cranes. Here and there they found the shore  \"completely covered with sea wolves\"--seals, of course, probably the  common seal and the grey seal. Of these they captured as many as they  wanted, for the seals, like most of the birds, were quite unafraid of  man.    [Footnote 10: There are no real rabbits in America. This was probably  the Polar Hare (_Lepus timidus glacialis_), or the common small  varying hare (_L. americanus_).]    They then explored the Bay of Fundy, and, after zig-zagging about,  decided to fix on the harbour of St. John's (New Brunswick) as the  site for their colony. The future capital of New France, therefore,  was begun on La Sainte Croix (Dochet) Island, near the mouth of the  wonderful tidal estuary of the Uigudi (Ouygoudy) River.    Here they passed the winter, but suffered so badly from scurvy[11]  that, when in the spring of 1605 Du Pont Grave arrived from Brittany  with supplies, the remnant of the colony was removed to the opposite  coast of Nova Scotia to Port Royal (afterwards named by the English  Annapolis[12]). The French seem to have fallen in love with this place  from the very first. Nevertheless here they suffered from scurvy  during the winter as elsewhere. Before moving over here, however,  Champlain, together with De Monts, had explored the west of New  England south of New Brunswick as far as Plymouth, just south of  Boston.    [Footnote 11: How awful was this \"mal de terre\" or scurvy amongst the  French settlers may be seen from this description of Champlain: \"There  were produced in the mouths of those who had it great pieces of  superfluous and drivelling flesh, which got the upper hand to such an  extent that scarcely anything but liquid could be taken. Their teeth  became very loose and could be pulled out with the fingers without its  causing them pain.... Afterwards a violent pain seized their arms and  legs, which remained swollen and very hard, all spotted as if with  fleabites; and they could not walk on account of the contraction of  the muscles.... They suffered intolerable pains in the loins, stomach,  and bowels, and had a very bad cough and short breath.... Out of  seventy-nine who composed our party, thirty-five died and twenty were  on the point of death (when spring began in May).\"    Scurvy is said to be a disease of the blood caused by a damp, cold,  and impure atmosphere combined with absence of vegetable food and a  diet of salted or semi-putrid meat or fish, such as was so often the  winter food of Amerindians and of the early French pioneers in Canada.  We have already noted Cartier's discovery of the balsam remedy.]    [Footnote 12: From Queen Anne.]    Off the coast of Maine (Richmond's Island) they encountered  agricultural Amerindians of a new tribe, the Penobskot probably, who  cultivated a form of rank narcotic tobacco (_Nicotiana rustica_),  which they called _Petun_. (A variety of this has produced the  handsome garden flower _Petunia_, whose Latin name is derived from  this native word Petun.) They also grew maize or Indian corn, planting  very carefully three or four seeds in little mounds three feet apart  one from the other, the soil in between being kept clear of weeds. The  American farmers of to-day cannot adopt any better method.    The islands round about Portland (Maine) were matted all over with  wild red currants, so that the eye could scarcely discern anything  else. Attracted by this fruit, clouds of wild pigeons had  assembled[13]. They manifested hardly any fear of the French, who  captured large numbers of them in snares, or killed them with guns.  The natives of southern Maine fled with dismay on sighting the French  ships, for they had never before seen sailing vessels, but later on  they timidly approached the French ships in a canoe, then landed and  went through a wild dance on the shore to typify friendliness.  Champlain took with him some drawing paper and a pencil or crayon,  together with a quantity of knives and ship's biscuit. Landing alone,  he attracted the natives towards him by offering them biscuits, and  having gathered them round him (being of course as much unable to  understand their speech as they were French), he proceeded to ask  questions by means of certain drawings, chiefly the outlines of the  coast. The savages at once seized his idea, and taking up his pencil  drew on the paper an accurate outline of Massachusetts Bay, adding  also rivers and islands unknown to the French. They went on by further  intelligent signs to supply "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#11)"],[1," 1617, and he fixed upon a place called Fukiyacho,  which, on account of the quantities of rushes which grew there, was  named _Yoshi-Wara,_ or the rush-moor, a name which now-a-days, by a  play upon the word _yoshi,_ is written with two Chinese characters,  signifying the \"good,\" or \"lucky moor.\" The place was divided into  four streets, called the Yedo Street, the Second Yedo Street, the  Kioto Street, and the Second Kioto Street.    In the eighth month of the year 1655, when Yedo was beginning to  increase in size and importance, the Yoshiwara, preserving its name,  was transplanted bodily to the spot which it now occupies at the  northern end of the town. And the streets in it were named after the  places from which the greater number of their inhabitants originally  came, as the \"Sakai Street,\" the \"Fushimi Street,\" &c.    The official Guide to the Yoshiwara for 1869 gives a return of 153  brothels, containing 3,289 courtesans of all classes, from the  _Oiran_, or proud beauty, who, dressed up in gorgeous brocade of gold  and silver, with painted face and gilded lips, and with her teeth  fashionably blacked, has all the young bloods of Yedo at her feet,  down to the humble _Shinzo_, or white-toothed woman, who rots away her  life in the common stews. These figures do not, however, represent the  whole of the prostitution of Yedo; the Yoshiwara is the chief, but not  the only, abiding-place of the public women. At Fukagawa there is  another Flower District, built upon the same principle as the  Yoshiwara; while at Shinagawa, Shinjiku, Itabashi, Senji, and  Kadzukappara, the hotels contain women who, nominally only waitresses,  are in reality prostitutes. There are also women called _Jigoku-Omna,_  or hell-women, who, without being borne on the books of any brothel,  live in their own houses, and ply their trade in secret. On the whole,  I believe the amount of prostitution in Yedo to be wonderfully small,  considering the vast size of the city.    There are 394 tea-houses in the Yoshiwara, which are largely used as  places of assignation, and which on those occasions are paid, not by  the visitors frequenting them, but by the keepers of the brothels. It  is also the fashion to give dinners and drinking-parties at these  houses, for which the services of _Taikomochi_, or jesters, among whom  there are thirty-nine chief celebrities, and of singing and dancing  girls, are retained. The Guide to the Yoshiwara gives a list of  fifty-five famous singing-girls, besides a host of minor stars. These  women are not to be confounded with the courtesans. Their conduct is  very closely watched by their masters, and they always go out to  parties in couples or in bands, so that they may be a check upon one  another. Doubtless, however, in spite of all precautions, the shower  of gold does from time to time find its way to Danae's lap; and to be  the favoured lover of a fashionable singer or dancer is rather a  feather in the cap of a fast young Japanese gentleman. The fee paid to  singing-girls for performing during a space of two hours is one  shilling and fourpence each; for six hours the fee is quadrupled, and  it is customary to give the girls a _hana_, or present, for  themselves, besides their regular pay, which goes to the master of the  troupe to which they belong.    Courtesans, singing women, and dancers are bought by contractors,  either as children, when they are educated for their calling, or at a  more advanced age, when their accomplishments and charms render them  desirable investments. The engagement is never made life-long, for  once past the flower of their youth the poor creatures would be mere  burthens upon their masters; a courtesan is usually bought until she  shall have reached the age of twenty-seven, after which she becomes  her own property. Singers remain longer in harness, but even they  rarely work after the age of thirty, for Japanese women, like  Italians, age quickly, and have none of that intermediate stage  between youth and old age, which seems to be confined to countries  where there is a twilight.    Children destined to be trained as singers are usually bought when  they are five or six years old, a likely child fetching from about  thirty-five to fifty shillings; the purchaser undertakes the education  of his charge, and brings the little thing up as his own child. The  parents sign a paper absolving him from all responsibility in case of  sickness or accident; but they know that their child will be well  treated and cared for, the interests of the buyer being their material  guarantee. Girls of fifteen or upwards who are sufficiently  accomplished to join a company of singers fetch ten times the price  paid for children; for in their case there is no risk and no expense  of education.    Little children who are bought for purposes of prostitution at the age  of five or six years fetch about the same price as those that are  bought to be singers. During their novitiate they are employed to wait  upon the _Oiran_, or fashionable courtesans, in the capacity of little  female pages (_Kamuro_). They are mostly the children of distressed  persons, or orphans, whom their relatives cruelly sell rather than be  at the expense and trouble of bringing them up. Of the girls who enter  the profession later in life, some are orphans, who have no other  means of earning a livelihood; others sell their bodies out of filial  piety, that they may succour their sick or needy parents; others are  married women, who enter the Yoshiwara to supply the wants of their  husbands; and a very small proportion is recruited from girls who have  been seduced and abandoned, perhaps sold, by faithless lovers.    The time to see the Yoshiwara to the best advantage is just after  nightfall, when the lamps are lighted. Then it is that the women--who  for the last two hours have been engaged in gilding their lips and  painting their eyebrows black, and their throats and bosoms a snowy  white, carefully leaving three brown Van-dyke-collar points where the  back of the head joins the neck, in accordance with one of the  strictest rules of Japanese cosmetic science--leave the back rooms,  and take their places, side by side, in a kind of long narrow cage,  the wooden bars of which open on to the public thoroughfare. Here they  sit for hours, gorgeous in dresses of silk and gold and silver  embroidery, speechless and motionless as wax figures, until they shall  have attracted the attention of some of the passers-by, who begin to  throng the place. At Yokohama indeed, and at the other open ports, the  women of the Yoshiwara are loud in their invitations to visitors,  frequently relieving the monotony of their own language by some  blasphemous term of endearment picked up from British and American  seamen; but in the Flower District at Yedo, and wherever Japanese  customs are untainted, the utmost decorum prevails. Although the shape  which vice takes is ugly enough, still it has this merit, that it is  unobtrusive. Never need the pure be contaminated by contact with the  impure; he who goes to the Yoshiwara, goes there knowing full well  what he will find, but the virtuous man may live through his life  without having this kind of vice forced upon his sight. Here again do  the open ports contrast unfavourably with other places: Yokohama at  night is as leprous a place as the London Haymarket.[14]    [Footnote 14: Those who are interested in this branch of social  science, will find much curious information upon the subject of  prostitution in Japan in a pamphlet published at Yokohama, by Dr.  Newton, R.N., a philanthropist who has been engaged for the last two  years in establishing a Lock Hospital at that place. In spite of much  opposition, from prejudice and ignorance, his labours have been  crowned by great success.]    A public woman or singer on entering her profession assumes a _nom de  guerre_, by which she is known until her engagement is at an end. Some  of these names are so pretty and quaint that I will take a few  specimens from the _Yoshiwara Saiken_, the guidebook upon which this  notice is based. \"Little Pine,\" \"Little Butterfly,\" \"Brightness of the  Flowers,\" \"The Jewel River,\" \"Gold Mountain,\" \"Pearl Harp,\" \"The Stork  that lives a Thousand Years,\" \"Village of Flowers,\" \"Sea Beach,\" \"The  Little Dragon,\" \"Little Purple,\" \"Silver,\" \"Chrysanthemum,\"  \"Waterfall,\" \"White Brightness,\" \"Forest of Cherries,\"--these and a  host of other quaint conceits are the one prettiness of a very foul  place.          KAZUMA'S REVENGE      It is a law that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword. In  Japan, where there exists a large armed class over whom there is  practically little or no control, party and clan broils, and single  quarrels ending in bloodshed and death, are matters of daily  occurrence; and it has been observed that Edinburgh in the olden time,  when the clansmen, roistering through the streets at night, would pass  from high words to deadly blows, is perhaps the best European parallel  of modern Yedo or Kioto.    It follows that of all his possessions the Samurai sets most store by  his sword, his constant companion, his ally, defensive and offensive.  The price of a sword by a famous maker reaches a high sum: a Japanese  noble will sometimes be found girding on a sword, the blade of which  unmounted is worth from six hundred to a thousand riyos, say from L200  to L300, and the mounting, rich in cunning metal work, will be of  proportionate value. These swords are handed down as heirlooms from  father to son, and become almost a part of the wearer's own self.  Iyeyasu, the founder of the last dynasty of Shoguns, wrote in his  Legacy,[15] a code of rules drawn up for the guidance of his  successors and their advisers in the government, \"The girded sword is  the living soul of the Samurai. In the case of a Samurai forgetting  his sword, act as is appointed: it may not be overlooked.\"    [Footn"]]]
