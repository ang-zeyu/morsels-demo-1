So another  laugh of appreciation ran around the barroom at the mention of creasing.    \"No,\" answered Barry, \"I went out with a halter and after a while Satan  got used to me and followed me home.\"    They waited only long enough to draw deep breath; then came a long yell  of delight. But the obscure devil was growing stronger and stronger in  Strann. He beat on the bar until he got silence. Then he leaned over to  meet the eyes of Barry.    \"That,\" he remarked through his teeth, \"is a damned--lie!\"    There is only one way of answering that word in the mountain-desert, and  Barry did not take it. The melancholy brown eyes widened; he sighed, and  raising his glass of lemonade sipped it slowly. Came a sick silence in  the barroom. Men turned their eyes towards each other and then flashed  them away again. It is not good that one who has the eyes and the tongue  of a man should take water from another--even from a Jerry Strann. And  even Jerry Strann withdrew his eyes slowly from his prey, and shuddered;  the sight of the most grisly death is not so horrible as cowardice.    And the devil which was still strong in Strann made him look about for a  new target; Barry was removed from all danger by an incredible barrier.  He found that new target at once, for his glance reached to the corner  of the room and found there the greenish, glimmering eyes of the dog. He  smote upon the bar.    \"Is this a damned kennel?\" he shouted. \"Do I got to drink in a barnyard?  What's the dog doin' here?\"    And he caught up the heavy little whiskey glass and hurled it at the  crouching dog. It thudded heavily, but it brought no yelp of pain;  instead, a black thunderbolt leaped from the corner and lunged down the  room. It was the silence of the attack that made it terrible, and Strann  cursed and pulled his gun. He could never have used it. He was a whole  half second too late, but before the dog sprang a voice cut in: \"Bart!\"    It checked the animal in its very leap; it landed on the floor and slid  on stiffly extended legs to the feet of Strann.    \"Bart!\" rang the voice again.    And the beast, flattening to the floor, crawled backwards, inch by inch;  it was slavering, and there was a ravening madness in its eyes.    \"Look at it!\" cried Strann. \"By God, it's mad!\"    And he raised his gun to draw the bead.    \"Wait!\" called the same voice which had checked the spring of the dog.  Surely it could not have come from the lips of Barry. It held a  resonance of chiming metal; it was not loud, but it carried like a  brazen bell. \"Don't do it, Strann!\"    And it came to every man in the barroom that it was unhealthy to stand  between the two men at that instant; a sudden path opened from Barry to  Strann.    \"Bart!\" came the command again. \"Heel!\"    The dog obeyed with a slinking swiftness; Jerry Strann put up his gun  and smiled.    \"I don't take a start on no man,\" he announced quite pleasantly. \"I  don't need to. But--you yaller hearted houn'--get out from between. When  I make my draw I'm goin' to kill that damn wolf.\"    Now, the fighting face of Jerry Strann was well known in the Three B's,  and it was something for men to remember until they died in a peaceful  bed. Yet there was not a glance, from the bystanders, for Strann. They  stood back against the wall, flattening themselves, and they stared,  fascinated, at the slender stranger. Not that his face had grown ugly by  a sudden metamorphosis. It was more beautiful than ever, for the man was  smiling. It was his eyes which held them. Behind the brown a light was  growing, a yellow and unearthly glimmer which one felt might be seen on  the darkest night.    There was none of the coward in Jerry Strann. He looked full into that  yellow, glimmering, changing light--he looked steadily--and a strange  feeling swept over him. No, it was not fear. Long experience had taught  him that there was not another man in the Three B's, with the exception  of his own terrible brother, who could get a gun out of the leather  faster than he, but now it seemed to Jerry Strann that he was facing  something more than mortal speed and human strength and surety. He could  not tell in what the feeling was based. But it was a giant, dim  foreboding holding dominion over other men's lives, and it sent a train  of chilly-weakness through his blood.    \"It's a habit of mine,\" said Jerry Strann, \"to kill mad dogs when I see  'em.\" And he smiled again.    They stood for another long instant, facing each other. It was plain  that every muscle in Strann's body was growing tense; the very smile was  frozen on his lips. When he moved, at last, it was a convulsive jerk of  his arm, and it was said, afterward, that his gun was all clear of the  leather before the calm stranger stirred. No eye followed what happened.  Can the eye follow such speed as the cracking lash of a whip?    There was only one report. The forefinger of Strann did not touch his  trigger, but the gun slipped down and dangled loosely from his hand. He  made a pace forward with his smile grown to an idiotic thing and a  patch of red sprang out in the centre of his breast. Then he lurched  headlong to the floor.          CHAPTER X    \"SWEET ADELINE\"      Fatty Matthews came panting through the doors. He was one of those men  who have a leisurely build and a purely American desire for action; so  that he was always hurrying and always puffing. If he mounted a horse,  sweat started out from every pore; if he swallowed a glass of red-eye he  breathed hard thereafter. Yet he was capable of great and sustained  exertions, as many and many a man in the Three B's could testify. He was  ashamed of his fat. Imagine the soul of a Bald Eagle in the body of a  Poland China sow and you begin to have some idea of Fatty Matthews. Fat  filled his boots as with water and he made a \"squnching\" sound when he  walked; fat rolled along his jowls; fat made his very forehead flabby;  fat almost buried his eyes. But nothing could conceal the hawk-line of  his nose or the gleam of those half-buried eyes. His hair was  short-cropped, grey, and stood on end like bristles, and he was in the  habit of using his panting breath in humming--for that concealed the  puffing. So Fatty Matthews came through the doors and his little,  concealed eyes darted from face to face. Then he kneeled beside Strann.    He was humming as he opened Jerry's shirt; he was humming as he pulled  from his bag--for Fatty was almost as much doctor as he was marshal,  cowpuncher, miner, and gambler--a roll of cotton and another roll of  bandages. The crowd grouped around him, fascinated, and at his  directions some of them brought water and others raised and turned the  body while the marshal made the bandages; Jerry Strann was unconscious.  Fatty Matthews began to intersperse talk in his humming.    \"You was plugged from in front--my beauty--was you?\" grunted Fatty, and  then running the roll of bandage around the wounded man's chest he  hummed a bar of:       _\"Sweet Adeline, my Adeline,     At night, dear heart, for you I pine.\"_    \"Was Jerry lookin' the other way when he was spotted?\" asked Fatty of  the bystanders. \"O'Brien, you seen it?\"    O'Brien cleared his throat.    \"I didn't see nothin',\" he said mildly, and began to mop his bar, which  was already polished beyond belief.    \"Well,\" muttered Fatty Matthews, \"all these birds get it. And Jerry was  some overdue. Lew, you seen it?\"    \"Yep.\"    \"Some drunken bum do it?\"    Lew leaned to the ear of the kneeling marshal and whispered briefly.  Fatty opened his eyes and cursed until his panting forced him to break  off and hum.    \"Beat him to the draw?\" he gasped at length.    \"Jerry's gun was clean out before the stranger made a move,\" asserted  Lew.    \"It ain't possible,\" murmured the deputy, and hummed softly:       _\"In all my dreams, your fair face beams.\"_    He added sharply, as he finished the bandaging: \"Where'd he head for?\"    \"No place,\" answered Lew. \"He just now went out the door.\"    The deputy swore again, but he added, enlightened; \"Going to plead  self-defense, eh?\"    Big O'Brien leaned over the bar.    \"Listen, Fatty,\" he said earnestly, \"There ain't no doubt of it. Jerry  had his war-paint on. He tried to kill this feller Barry's wolf.\"    \"Wolf?\" cut in the deputy marshal.    \"Dog, I guess,\" qualified the bartender. \"I dunno. Anyway, Jerry made  all the leads; this Barry simply done the finishing. I say, don't put  this Barry under arrest. You want to keep him here for Mac Strann.\"    \"That's my business,\" growled Fatty. \"Hey, half a dozen of you gents.  Hook on to Jerry and take him up to a room. I'll be with you in a  minute.\"    And while his directions were being obeyed he trotted heavily up the  length of the barroom and out the swinging doors. Outside, he found only  one man, and in the act of mounting a black horse; the deputy marshal  made straight for that man until a huge black dog appeared from nowhere  blocking his path. It was a silent dog, but its teeth and eyes said  enough to stop Fatty in full career.    \"Are you Barry?\" he asked.    \"That's me. Come here, Bart.\"    The big dog backed to the other side of the horse without shifting his  eyes from the marshal. The latter gingerly approached the rider, who sat  perfectly at ease in the saddle; most apparently he was in no haste to  leave.    \"Barry,\" said the deputy, \"don't make no play when I tell you who I am;  I don't mean you no harm, but my name's Matthews, and--\" he drew back  the flap of his vest enough to show the glitter of his badge of office.  All the time his little beady eyes watched Barry with bird-like  intentness. The rider made not a move. And now Matthews noted more in  detail the feminine slenderness of the man and the large, placid eyes.  He stepped closer and dropped a confidential hand on the pommel of the  saddle.    \"Son,\" he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#11)"],[1,"sizes of rolls,  can be run at a high speed, and possesses automatic stop motions,  one for each roll.    A full roll and a partially-filled roll are clearly seen. A recent  improvement in the shape of a new yarn drag device, and an automatic  stop when the yarn breaks or the yarn on the bobbin is exhausted,  has just been introduced on to the Combe-Barbour frame.    [Illustration: FIG. 24 ROLL WINDING MACHINE (FROM HANKS) _By  permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.]    Weft Winding. A few firms wind jute weft yarn from the spinning  bobbins on to pirns (wooden centres). The great majority of  manufacturers, however, use cops for the loom shuttles. The cops are  almost invariably wound direct from the spinning bobbins, the  exception being coloured yarn which is wound from hank. There are  different types of machines used for cop winding, but in every case  the yarn is wound upon a bare spindle, and the yarn guide has a  rapid traverse in order to obtain the well-known cross-wind so  necessary for making a stable cop. The disposition of the cops in  the winding operation is vertical, but while in some machines the  tapered nose of the cop is in the high position and the spinning  bobbin from which the yarn is being drawn is in the low position, in  other machines these conditions are opposite. Thus, in the cop  winding frame made by Messrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd., Arbroath,  and illustrated in Fig. 25, the spinning bobbins are below the cops,  the tapered noses of the latter are upwards in their cones or shapers,  and the yarn guides are near the top of the machine. This view shows  about three-fourths of the full width of a 96-spindle machine, 48  spindles on each side, two practically full-length cops and one  partially built. The illustration in Fig. 26 is the above-mentioned  opposite type, and the one most generally adopted, with the spinning  bobbins as shown near the top of the frame, the yarn guides in the  low position, and the point or tapered nose of the cop pointing  downwards. Six spindles only appear in this view, which represents  the machine made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd., Dundee,  but it will be understood that all machines are made as long as  desired within practicable and economic limits.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd_.  FIG. 25 COP WINDING MACHINE]    The spindles of cop machines are gear driven as shown clearly in Fig.  26; the large skew bevel wheels are keyed to the main shaft, while  the small skew bevel wheels are loose on their respective spindles.  The upper face of each small skew bevel wheel forms one part of a  clutch; the other part of the clutch is slidably mounted on the  spindle. When the two parts of the clutch are separated, as they are  when the yarn breaks or runs slack, when it is exhausted, or when  the cop reaches a predetermined length, the spindle stops; but when  the two parts of the clutch are in contact, the small skew bevel  wheel drives the clutch, the latter rotates the spindle, and the  spindle in turn draws forward the yarn from the bobbin, and in  conjunction with the rapidly moving yarn guide and the inner surface  of the cone imparts in rapid succession new layers on the nose of  the cop, and thus the formed layers of the latter increase the  length proportionately to the amount of yarn drawn on, and the  partially completed cop moves slowly away from its cup or cone until  the desired length is obtained when the spindle is automatically  stopped and the winding for that particular spindle ceases. Cops may  be made of any length and any suitable diameter; a common size for  jute shuttle is 10 in. long, and 1-5/8 in. diameter, and the  angle formed by the two sides of the cone is approximately 30 degrees.    [Illustration: FIG 26 COP WINDING MACHINE _By permission of Messrs.  Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.]          CHAPTER XIII.  WARPING, BEAMING AND DRESSING    There are a few distinct methods of preparing warp threads on the  weaver's beam. Stated briefly, the chief methods are--    1. The warp is made in the form of a chain on a warping mill, and  when the completed chain is removed from the mill it is transferred  on to the weaver's beam.    2. The warp is made in the form of a chain on a linking machine, and  then beamed on to a weaver's beam.    3. The warp yarns are wound or beamed direct from the large  cylindrical \"rolls\" or \"spools\" on to a weaver's beam.    4. The warp yarns are starched, dried and beamed simultaneously on  to a weaver's beam.    The last method is the most extensively adapted; but we shall  describe the four processes briefly, and in the order mentioned.    For mill warping, as in No. 1 method, from 50 to 72 full spinning  bobbins are placed in the bank or creel as illustrated to the right  of each large circular warping mill in Fig. 27. The ends of the  threads from these bobbins are drawn through the eyes of two leaves  of the \"heck,\" and all the ends tied together. The heck, or  apparatus for forming what is known as the weaver's lease, drawer's  lease, or thread-by-thread lease, is shown clearly between the  bobbin bank and the female warper in the foreground of the  illustration. The heck is suspended by means of cords, or chains,  and so ranged that when the warping mill is rotated in one direction  the heck is lowered gradually between suitable slides, while when  the mill is rotated in the opposite direction the heck is raised  gradually between the same slides. These movements are necessary in  order that the threads from the bobbins may be arranged spirally  round the mill and as illustrated clearly on all the mills in the  figure. The particular method of arranging the ropes, or the gearing  if chains are used, determines the distance between each pair of  spirals; a common distance is about 1-1/2 in. There are about  42 spirals or rounds on the nearest mill in Fig. 27, and this number  multiplied by the circumference of the mill represents the length of  the warp.    [Illustration: FIG. 27 A ROW OF MODERN WARPING MILLS]    At the commencement, the heck is at the top, and when the weaver's  lease has been formed on the three pins near the top of the mill  with the 50 to 72 threads (often 56), the mill is rotated by means  of the handle and its connections shown near the bottom of the mill.  As the mill rotates, the heck with the threads descends gradually  and thus the group of threads is disposed spirally on the vertical  spokes of the mill until the desired length of the warp is reached.  A beamer's lease or \"pin lease\" is now made on the two lower pegs;  there may be two, three, four or more threads in each group of the  pin lease; a common number is 7 to 9. When this pin lease has been  formed, one section of the warp has been made, the proportion  finished being (50 to 72)/x where x is the total number of threads  required for the cloth. The same kind of lease must again be made on  the same two pins at the bottom for the beginning of the next  section of 50 to 72 threads, and the mill rotated in the opposite  direction in order to draw up the heck, and to cause the second  group of 50 to 72 threads to be arranged spirally and in close touch  with the threads of the first group. When the heck reaches the top of  the mill, the single-thread lease is again made, all the threads  passed round the end pin, and then all is ready for repeating the  same two operations until the requisite number of threads has been  introduced on to the mill. If it is impossible to accommodate all the  threads for the cloth on the mill, the warp is made in two or more  parts or chains. It will be noticed that the heck for the nearest  mill is opposite about the 12th round of threads from the bobbin,  whereas the heck for the second mill is about the same distance from  the top. A completed warp or chain is being bundled up opposite the  third mill. When the warp is completed it is pulled off the mill and  simultaneously linked into a chain.    A very similar kind of warp can be made more quickly, and often  better, on what is termed the linking machine mentioned in No. 2  method. Such a machine is illustrated in Fig. 28, and the full  equipment demands the following four distinct kinds of apparatus--a  bank capable of holding approximately 300 spools, a frame for  forming the weaver's lease and the beamer's lease, machine for  drawing the threads from the spools in the bank and for measuring  the length and marking the warp at predetermined intervals, and  finally the actual machine which links the group of threads in the  form of a chain.    In Fig. 28 part of the large bank, with a few rows of spools, is  shown in the extreme background. The two sets of threads, from the  two wings of the bank, are seen distinctly, and the machine or frame  immediately in front of the bank is where the two kinds of lease are  made when desired, i.e. at the beginning and at the end of the warp.  Between this leasing frame and the linking machine proper, shown in  the foreground, is the drawing, measuring and marking machine. Only  part of this machine is seen--the driving pulleys and part of the  frame adjoining them. All these frames and machines are necessary,  but the movements embodied in them, or the functions which they  perform, are really subsidiary to those of the linker shown in the  foreground of Fig. 28.    [Illustration: FIG. 28 POWER CHAIN OF WARP LINKING MACHINE]    Although the linking machine is composed of only a few parts, it is  a highly-ingenious combination of mechanical parts; these parts  convert the straight running group of 300 threads into a linked chain,  and the latter is shown distinctly descending from the chute on to  the floor in the figure. Precisely the same kind of link is made by  the hand wrappers when the warps indicated in Fig. 27 are being  withdrawn from the mills. Two completed chains are shown tied up in  Fig. 28, and a stock"]]]
