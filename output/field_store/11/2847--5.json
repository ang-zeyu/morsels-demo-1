Now I  will tell you what this adventure is on which we are set; it is this--there  is, some small distance from this, a castle of a knight hight Sir Turquine,  who hath in his prison a great many knights of King Arthur's court, and  several knights of his Round Table. These knights he keepeth there in great  dole and misery, for it is said that their groans may be heard by the  passers along the high-road below the castle. This Sir Turquine is held to  be the greatest knight in the world (unless it be thou) for he hath never  yet been overcome in battle, whether a-horseback or a-foot. But, indeed, I  think it to be altogether likely that thou wilt overcome him.\"    \"Fair damsel,\" quoth Sir Launcelot, \"I too have hope that I shall hold mine  own with him, when I meet him, and to that I shall do my best endeavor. Yet  this and all other matters are entirely in the hands of God.\"    Then the damsel said, \"If you should overcome this Sir Turquine, I know of  still another adventure which, if you do not undertake it, I know of no one  else who may undertake to bring it to a successful issue.\"    Quoth Sir Launcelot, \"I am glad to hear of that or of any other adventure,  for I take great joy in such adventuring. Now, tell me, what is this other  adventure?\"    [Sidenote: The maiden tells Sir Launcelot of the savage forest knight]  \"Sir,\" said the damsel, \"a long distance to the west of this there is a  knight who hath a castle in the woods and he is the evilest disposed knight  that ever I heard tell of. For he lurks continually in the outskirts of the  woods, whence he rushes forth at times upon those who pass by. Especially  he is an enemy to all ladies of that country, for he hath taken many of  them prisoners to his castle and hath held them in the dungeon thereof for  ransom; and sometimes he hath held them for a long while. Now I am fain  that thou undertake that adventure for my sake.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I believe it would be a good thing for any  knight to do to rid the world of such an evil-disposed knight as that, so  if I have the good fortune to overcome this Sir Turquine, I give my  knightly word that I will undertake this adventure for thy sake, if so be  thou wilt go with me for to show me the way to his castle.\"    \"That I will do with all gladness,\" said the damsel, \"for it is great pride  for any lady to ride with you upon such an adventure.\"    Thus they talked, and all was arranged betwixt them. And thus they rode  very pleasantly through that valley for the distance of two leagues or a  little more, until they came to that place where the road crossed the  smooth stream of water afore told of; and there was the castle of Sir  Turquine as afore told of; and there was the thorn-bush and the basin  hanging upon the thorn-bush as afore told of. Then the maiden said: \"Sir  Launcelot, beat upon that basin and so thou shalt summon Sir Turquine to  battle with thee.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot smites upon the basin] So Sir Launcelot rode to  that basin where it hung and he smote upon it very violently with the butt  of his spear. And he smote upon that basin again and again until he smote  the bottom from out it; but at that time immediately no one came.    Then, after a while, he was ware of one who came riding toward him, and he  beheld that he who came riding was a knight very huge of frame, and long  and strong of limb. And he beheld that the knight was clad entirely in  black, and that the horse upon which he rode and all the furniture of the  horse was black. And he beheld that this knight drave before him another  horse, and that across the saddle of that other horse there lay an armed  knight, bound hand and foot; and Sir Launcelot wist that the sable knight  who came riding was that Sir Turquine whom he sought.    [Sidenote: The sable knight bringeth Sir Gaheris captive] So Sir Turquine  came very rapidly along the highway toward where Sir Launcelot sat, driving  that other horse and the captive knight before him all the while. And as  they came nearer and nearer Sir Launcelot thought that he should know who  the wounded knight was and when they came right close, so that he could see  the markings of the shield of that captive knight, he wist that it was Sir  Gaheris, the brother of Sir Gawaine, and the nephew of King Arthur, whom  Sir Turquine brought thither in that wise.    At this Sir Launcelot was very wroth; for he could not abide seeing a  fellow-knight of the Round Table treated with such disregard as that which  Sir Gaheris suffered at the hands of Sir Turquine; wherefore Sir Launcelot  rode to meet Sir Turquine, and he cried out: \"Sir Knight! put that wounded  man down from his horse, and let him rest for a while, and we two will  prove our strength, the one against the other! For it is a shame for thee  to treat a noble knight of the Round Table with such despite as thou art  treating that knight.\"    \"Sir,\" said Sir Turquine, \"as I treat that knight, so treat I all knights  of the Round Table--and so will I treat thee if thou be of the Round  Table.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"as for that, I am indeed of the Round Table,  and I have come hither for no other reason than for to do battle with  thee.\"    \"Sir Knight,\" said Sir Turquine, \"thou speakest very boldly; now I pray  thee to tell me what knight thou art and what is thy name.\"    \"Messire,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I have no fear to do that. I am called Sir  Launcelot of the Lake, and I am a knight of King Arthur's, who made me  knight with his own hand.\"    \"Ha!\" said Sir Turquine, \"that is very good news to me, for of all knights  in the world thou art the one I most desire to meet, for I have looked for  thee for a long while with intent to do battle with thee. For it was thou  who didst slay my brother Sir Caradus at Dolorous Gard, who was held to be  the best knight in all the world. Wherefore, because of this, I have the  greatest despite against thee of any man in the world, and it was because  of that despite that I waged particular battle against all the knights of  King Arthur's court. And in despite of thee I now hold five score and eight  knights, who are thy fellows, in the dismallest dungeon of my castle. Also  I have to tell thee that among those knights is thine own brother, Sir  Ector, and thy kinsman, Sir Lionel. For I overthrew Sir Ector and Sir  Lionel only a day or two ago, and now they lie almost naked in the lower  parts of that castle yonder. I will put down this knight as thou biddst me,  and when I have done battle with thee I hope to tie thee on his  saddle-horn in his place.\"    So Sir Turquine loosed the cords that bound Sir Gaheris and set him from  off the horse's back, and Sir Gaheris, who was sorely wounded and very  weak, sat him down upon a slab of stone near-by.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquine do battle together] Then Sir  Launcelot and Sir Turquine made themselves ready at all points, and each  took such stand as seemed to him to be best; and when each was ready for  the assault, each set spurs to his horse and rushed the one against the  other with such terrible violence that they smote together like a clap of  thunder.    So fierce was that onset that each horse fell back upon the ground and only  by great skill and address did the knight who rode him void his saddle, so  as to save himself from a fall. And in that meeting the horse of Sir  Turquine was killed outright and the back of Sir Launcelot's horse was  broken and he could not rise, but lay like dead upon the ground.    Then each knight drew his sword and set his shield before him and they came  together with such wrath that it appeared as though their fierce eyes shot  sparks of fire through the oculariums of their helmets. So they met and  struck; and they struck many scores of times, and their blows were so  violent that neither shield nor armor could withstand the strokes they  gave. For their shields were cleft and many pieces of armor were hewn from  their limbs, so that the ground was littered with them. And each knight  gave the other so many grim wounds that the ground presently was all  sprinkled with red where they stood.    Now that time the day had waxed very hot, for it was come high noontide, so  presently Sir Turquine cried out: \"Stay thee, Sir Launcelot, for I have a  boon to ask!\" At this Sir Launcelot stayed his hand and said: \"What is it  thou hast to ask, Sir Knight?\" Sir Turquine said: \"Messire, I am  athirst--let me drink.\" And Sir Launcelot said: \"Go and drink.\"    So Sir Turquine went to that river and entered into that water, which was  presently stained with red all about him. And he stooped where he stood and  drank his fill, and presently came forth again altogether refreshed.    Therewith he took up his sword once more and rushed at Sir Launcelot and  smote with double strength, so that Sir Launcelot bent before him and had  much ado to defend himself from these blows.    Then by and by Sir Launcelot waxed faint upon his part and was athirst, and  he cried out: \"I crave of thee a boon, Sir Knight!\" \"What wouldst thou  have?\" said Sir Turquine. \"Sir Knight,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"bide while I  drink, for I am athirst.\" \"Nay,\" said Sir Turquine, \"thou shalt not drink  until thou quenchest thy thirst in Paradise.\" \"Ha!\" cried Sir Launcelot,  \"thou art a foul churl and no true knight. For when thou wert athirst, I  let thee drink; and now that I am athirst, thou deniest me to quench my  thirst.\"    Therewith he was filled with such anger that he was like one gone wode;  wherefore he flung aside his shield and took his sword in both hands and  rushed upon Sir Turquine and smote him again and again; and the blows he  gave were so fierce that Sir Turquine waxed somewhat bewildered and bore  aback, and held his shield low for faintness.

Chilcot, or Pyramid Harbor, is about twelve hours run from Juneau, and it  is here the famous Chilcot blanket is made from the goat's wool, woven by  hand, and dyed by native dyes, and worked from grotesque patterns. Here,  also, are two of the largest salmon canneries in Alaska, and here,  indeed, were we in the    LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN.    The hours passed quickly by as the supposed night wore away. At midnight  the twilight was so bright that one could read a newspaper easily. Then  the moon shone in the clear sky with all regal splendor until 3.30 in the  morning, when old Sol again put in his claims for admission. He lifted his  golden head above the snowy peaks, and spirited away the uncertain light  of unfolding dawn by drawing the curtains of the purpling east, and  sending floods of radiance upon the entire world. It was a sight never to  be forgotten, if seen but once in a lifetime.    Onward once again when the tide was in, and our next awakening was on the  grand glacier fields. The greatest sight of the entire trip, or of any  other in America, now opened out before many eager eyes. For several  days, icebergs had been seen sailing along on the smooth surface from the  great glaciers, and speeding to the southern seas like phantom ships. As  the ship neared the bay, these huge bergs increased in size and number,  with such grotesque and weird shapes, that the mind is absorbed in  shaping turrets, ghosts, goblins, and the like, each moment developing  more and more of things unearthly, until the heart and eyes seem bursting  with the strain, when suddenly a great roar, like the shock of an  explosion of giant powder, turns the eyes to the parent glacier to see  the birth of these unnatural forms. They break from the icy wall with a  stupendous crash, and fall into the water with such force as to send our  great ship careening on her side when the swell from the disturbed waters  strikes her.    The Muir glacier is the one that occupies the most attention, as it is  the most accessible to tourists. It rises to a perpendicular height of  350 feet, and stretches across the entire head of the Glacier Bay, which  is estimated from three to five miles in width. The Muir and Davidson  glaciers are two arms of that great Ice field extending more than 400  miles in length, covering more area    THAN ALL SWITZERLAND,    and any one of the fifteen subdivisions of the glacial stream is as large  as the Great Rhone glacier.    Underlying this great ice field is that glacial river which bears these  mountains of ice on its bosom to the ocean. With a roar like distant  artillery, or an approaching thunder-storm, the advancing walls of this  great monster split and fall into the watery deep, which has been sounded  to a depth of some 800 feet without finding anchor.    The glacial wall is a rugged, uneven mass, with clefts and crevices,  towering pinnacles and domes, higher than Bunker Hill monument, cutting  the air at all angles, and with a stupendous crash sections break off  from any portion without warning and sink far out of sight. Scarcely two  minutes elapse without a portion falling from some quarter. The marble  whiteness of the face is relieved by lines of intense blue, a  characteristic peculiar to the small portions as well as the great.    Going ashore in little rowboats, the vast area along the sandy beach was  first explored, and it was, indeed, like a fairy land. There were acres  of grottoes, whose honey-combed walls were most delicately carved by the  soft winds and the sunlight reflections around and in the arches of ice,  such as are never seen except in water, ice, and sky.    MOUNTAINS OF ICE,    remnants of glaciers, along the beach, stood poised on one point, or  perchance on two points, and arched between. These icebergs were dotted  with stones imbedded; great bowls were melted out and filled with water,  and little cups made of ice would afford you a drink of fresh water on  the shore of this salt sea.    At five o'clock in the morning, with the sun kissing the cold majestic  glacier into a glad awakening from its icy sleep, the ascent was begun.  Too eager to be among the first to see the top, many started without  breakfast, while others chose the wiser part, and waited to be physically  fortified.    The ascent is not so difficult as it is dangerous. There is no trail and  no guide, and many a step had to be retraced to get across or around some  bottomless fissure. For some distance the ground seemed quite solid. Soon  it was discovered that there was but a thin covering of dirt on the solid  ice below; but anon in striking the ground with the end of an alpine stick  it would prove to be but an inch of ice and dirt mixed, and a dark abyss  below which we could not fathom. It is to be hoped, for the good of  future tourists, that there are not many such places, or that they may  soon be exposed so they can be avoided. Reaching the top after a tedious  and slippery climb, there was a long view of icy billows, as if the sea  had suddenly congealed amid a wild tempestuous storm. Deep chasms  obstructed the way on all sides, and a misstep or slip would send one  down the blue steps where no friendly rope could rescue, and only the  rushing water could be heard. To view the solid phalanxes of icy floes,  as they fill the mountain fastnesses and imperceptibly march through the  ravines and force their way to the sea, fills one with awe indescribable.  The knowledge that the ice is moving from beneath one's feet thrills one  with a curious sensation hard to portray.    Below, it seems like the constant wooing of the sea that wins the  offering from this wealth of purity, instead of the voluntary act of this  giant of the Arctic zone.    For twenty-four hours the awful grandeur of these scenes was gloried in,  when Captain Hunter gave the order to draw the anchor and steam away. The  whistles call the passengers back to the steamer, where they were soon  comparing specimens, viewing instantaneous photographs, hiding bedraggled  clothing, casting away tattered mufflers, and telling of hair-breadth  escapes from peril and death. Many a tired head sought an early pillow,  and floated away in dreams of ghoulish icebergs, until the call for  breakfast disclosed to opening eyes that the boat was anchored in the    BEAUTIFUL HARBOR OF SITKA.    The steamer's whistle is the signal for a holiday in all Alaska ports,  and Sitka is no exception to the rule. Six o'clock in the morning, but  the sleepy town had awakened to the fact of our arrival, and the  inhabitants were out in force to greet friends or sell their canoes.  There are some 1,500 people living in Sitka, including all races. The  harbor is the most beautiful a fertile brain can imagine. Exquisitely  moulded islands are scattered about in the most enchanting way, all  shapes and sizes, with now and then a little garden patch, and ever  verdant with native woods and grasses and charming rockeries. As far out  as the eye can reach the beautiful isles break the cold sea into  bewitching inlets and lure the mariner to shelter from evil outside waves.    The village nestles between giant mountains on a lowland curve surrounded  by verdure too dense to be penetrated with the eye, and too far to try to  walk--which is a good excuse for tired feet. The first prominent feature  to meet the eye on land is a large square house, two stories high,  located on a rocky eminence near the shore, and overlooking the entire  town and harbor. Once it was a model dwelling of much pretension, with  its spacious apartments, hard-wood six-inch plank floors,  elaborately-carved decorations, stained-glass windows, and its amusement  and refreshment halls. All betoken the former elegance of the Russian  governor's home, which was supported with such pride and magnificence as  will never be seen there again. The walls are crumbling, the windows  broken, and the old oaken stairways will soon be sinking to earth again,  and its only life will be on the page of history.    [Illustration: DEVIL'S THUMB, ALASKA.  Reached via the Union Pacific Ry.]    The mission-school hospital, chapel, and architectural buildings occupied  much of the tourists' time, and some were deeply interested. There are  eighteen missionaries in Sitka, under the Presbyterian jurisdiction,  trying to educate and Christianize the Indians. They are doing a noble  work, but it does seem a hopeless task when one goes among the Indian  homes, sees the filth, smells the vile odors, and studies the native  habits.    These Indians, like the other tribes, are not poor, but all have more or  less money.    MANY ARE RICH,    having more than $20,000 in good hard cash, yet the squalor in which they  live would indicate the direst poverty.    The stroll to Indian river, from which the town gets its water supply, is  bewitching. The walk is made about six feet through an evergreen forest,  the trees arching overhead, for a distance of two miles, and is close to  the bay, and following the curve in a most picturesque circle. The water  is carried in buckets loaded on carts and wheeled by hand, for horses are  almost unknown in Alaska. There are probably not more than half a dozen  horses and mules in all Alaska--not so much because of the expense of  transportation and board, as lack of roads and the long, dark days and  months of winter, when people do not go out but very little. All the  packing is done in all sections of Alaska by natives carrying the packs  and supplies on their backs.    Sitka's most interesting object is the old Greek church, located in the  middle of the town, and also in the middle of the street. Its form is  that of a Greek cross, with a copper-covered dome, surmounted by a  chime-bell tower. The inside glitters with gold and rare paintings, gold  embroidered altar cloths and robes; quaint candelabra of solid silver are  suspended in many nooks, and an air "]]]
