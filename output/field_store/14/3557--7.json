You will have to keep public men       up to the mark, and each one of you will have to make up his mind       whether he is prepared to see this colony remain a part of the       British Empire, which carries with it obligations as well as       privileges, or whether he is prepared to obey the dictates of the       Bond. From the very first time, some years ago, when the poison       began to be instilled into the country, I felt that it must come       to this--Is England or the Transvaal to be the paramount force in       South Africa?... Since then that institution has made a show of       loyalty, while it stirred up disloyalty.... Some people, who       should have known better, were dragged into the toils under the       idea that they could influence it for good, but the whole       teaching of history goes to show that when the conflict was       between men of extreme views and moderate men, the violent       section triumphed. And so we see that some moderate men are in       the power of an institution whose avowed object is to combat the       British Government. In any other country such an organisation       could not have grown; but here, among a scattered population, it       has insidiously and successfully worked.... No one who wishes       well for the British Government could have read the leading       articles of the _Zuid Africaan_, and _Express_, and _De Patriot_,       in expounding the Bond principles, without seeing that the       maintenance of law and order under the British Crown and the       object they have in view are absolutely different things. My       quarrel with the Bond is that it stirs up race differences. Its       main object is to make the South African Republic the paramount       power in South Africa.\"    This was plain speaking. The rare insight revealed in such a sentence  as this--\"in any other country such an organisation could not have  grown, but here, _among a scattered population_, it has insidiously  and successfully worked\"; the piquant incident of the reproduction of  the speech on the eve of the war; the fact that the man who made this  diagnosis was to drink the poison whose fatal effects he described so  faithfully, was indeed to become the most bitter opponent of the great  statesman that \"kept South Africa a part of the British  Empire,\"--these things together make Mr. Merriman's Grahamstown speech  one of the most curious and instructive of the political utterances of  the period.    [Sidenote: Change of Bond policy.]    In the year following (1886) the Bond met officially, for the first  and only time, as an inter-state organisation. Bloemfontein was the  place of assemblage, and in the Central Bestuur, or Committee, the  South African Republic, the Free State, and the Cape Colony were each  represented by two delegates. This meeting revealed the practical  difficulties which prevented the Cape nationalists from adopting the  definitely anti-British programme of the Bond leaders in the  Republics; and the conflict of commercial interests between the Cape  Colony and the Transvaal, already initiated by the attempt of the  latter to secure Bechuanaland in 1884-5, confirmed the Cape delegates  in their decision to develop the Bond in the Cape Colony upon colonial  rather than inter-state lines. The result of the divergences of aim  manifested at Bloemfontein was speedily made apparent in the Cape  Colony. In 1887 Mr. T. P. Theron, then Secretary of the Bond,  delivered an address in which the new, or Hofmeyr, programme was  formulated and officially adopted. In recommending the new policy to  the members of the Bond, Mr. Theron made no secret of the nature of  the considerations by which its leaders had been chiefly influenced.         \"You must remember,\" he said, \"that the eyes of all are directed       towards you. The Press will cause your actions, expressions, and       resolutions to be known everywhere. You cannot but feel how much       depends on us for our nation and our country. If we must plead       guilty in the past of many an unguarded expression, let us be       more cautious and guarded for the future.\"    And he then proceeded to sketch a picture of racial conciliation, when  all \"differences and disagreements\" between Dutch and English would be  merged in the consciousness of a new and common nationality--pointing  out, however, that the advent of that day depended on \"you and me, my  fellow Bond members.\"    [Sidenote: Rhodes and Hofmeyr.]    Assuming that the predominance of Afrikander ideals could be secured  only by the complete separation of the local governments from the  Government of Great Britain, nothing could be more masterly than the  manner in which the Bond approached the task of reuniting the European  communities of South Africa--the task which the Imperial Government  had abandoned as hopeless. As inspired and controlled by Hofmeyr  during the years between this date (1887) and the Jameson Raid, the  Bond embodied a volume of effort in which the most sincere supporter  of the British connection could co-operate. It was the assistance  afforded by the Bond in moulding British administration in South  Africa upon South African lines that provided the common ground upon  which Rhodes and Hofmeyr met in their long alliance. Hofmeyr probably  never abandoned his belief that a republican form of government was  the inevitable _denouement_ to which the administration of South  Africa on a basis of South African ideas must lead. Rhodes never  wavered in his loyalty to the British connection. But there was a  great body of useful work which both men could accomplish in common,  which each desired to see accomplished, which, when accomplished,  would leave each free to choose the path--Republican or Imperial--by  which the last stage was to be traversed and the goal of South  African unity finally attained.    The character and career of Rhodes afford material for a study of such  peculiar and engrossing interest that any adequate treatment of the  subject would require a separate volume. Fortunately, the broad facts  of his life are sufficiently well known to make it unnecessary to  attempt the almost impossible task of condensing a volume within the  limits of a few pages. None the less, there is one incident in his  political career which must be recalled here, and that for the simple  reason that it establishes two facts, each of which is essential to  the complete understanding of the situation in the Cape Colony as it  developed immediately after the Raid. First, that all through the  years of the Rhodes-Hofmeyr alliance the Bond remained at heart true  to the aim which it had at first openly avowed--the aim of  establishing a united South Africa under its own flag. And second,  that Rhodes was equally staunch in maintaining his ideal of a united  South Africa under the British flag. The incident which exhibits both  these facts in the clearest light is the refusal by Rhodes of the  overtures made to him by Borckenhagen. At the time when these  overtures were made Rhodes was Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, the  Chartered Company had been successfully launched, and the alliance  between himself and Hofmeyr was in full operation. The occasion which  led to them was the opening of the railway at Bloemfontein in 1890--a  railway constructed by the Cape Government under a friendly  arrangement with the Free State. And it was one, therefore, which  afforded a conspicuous example of the value of the Bond influence as a  means of securing progress in the direction of South African unity.  The story was told by Rhodes himself in a speech which he made in the  Cape Colony on March 12th, 1898.    [Sidenote: Rhodes and Borckenhagen.]         \"I remember,\" he said, \"that we had a great meeting at       Bloemfontein, and in the usual course I had to make a speech. I       think I was your Prime Minister. And this speech pleased many       there, and especially--and I speak of him with the greatest       respect--a gentleman who is dead, Mr. Borckenhagen. He came to me       and asked me to dictate to him the whole of my speech. I said, 'I       never wrote a speech, and I don't know what I said; but I will       tell you what I know about it.' He wrote it down, and afterwards       came to Capetown with me.... He spoke very nicely to me about my       speech. 'Mr. Rhodes, we want a united South Africa.' And I said,       'So do I; I am with you entirely. We must have a united South       Africa.' He said, 'There is nothing in the way.' And I said, 'No;       there is nothing in the way. Well,' I said, 'we are one.' 'Yes,'       he said, 'and I will tell you: we will take you as our leader,'       he said. 'There is only one small thing, and that is, we must, of       course, be independent to the rest of the world.' I said, 'No;       you take me either for a rogue or a fool. I would be a rogue to       forget all my history and traditions; and I would be a fool,       because I would be hated by my own countrymen and mistrusted by       yours.' From that day he assumed a most acrid tone in his       _Express_ towards myself, and I was made full sorry at times by       the tone. But that was the overpowering thought in his mind--an       independent South Africa.\"[23]             [Footnote 23: _Cecil Rhodes: His Political Life and           Speeches._ By Vindex; p. 533.

This, I believe, is a fact by no means uncommon.    My retriever will carry an egg in his mouth to a great distance, and  during a considerable length of time, without ever breaking or even  cracking the shell. A small bird having escaped from its cage and  fallen into the sea, a dog conveyed it in his mouth to the ship,  without doing it the slightest injury.    [Illustration: RETRIEVER.]    One of the carriers of a New York paper called the \"Advocate,\" having  become indisposed, his son took his place; but not knowing the  subscribers he was to supply, he took for his guide a dog which had  usually attended his father. The animal trotted on a-head of the boy,  and stopped at every door where the paper was in use to be left,  without making a single omission or mistake.    The following is from a newspaper of this year:--    \"A most extraordinary circumstance has just occurred at the Hawick  toll-bar, which is kept by two old women. It appears that they had a  sum of money in the house, and were extremely alarmed lest they should  be robbed of it. Their fears prevailed to such an extent, that, when a  carrier whom they knew was passing by, they urgently requested him to  remain with them all night, which, however, his duties would not  permit him to do; but, in consideration of the alarm of the women, he  consented to leave with them a large mastiff dog. In the night the  women were disturbed by the uneasiness of the dog, and heard a noise  apparently like an attempt to force an entrance into the premises,  upon which they escaped by the back-door, and ran to a neighbouring  house, which happened to be a blacksmith's shop. They knocked at the  door, and were answered from within by the smith's wife. She said her  husband was absent, but that she was willing to accompany the  terrified women to their home. On reaching the house, they heard a  savage but half-stifled growling from the dog. On entering they saw  the body of a man hanging half in and half out of their little window,  whom the dog had seized by the throat, and was still worrying. On  examination, the man proved to be their neighbour the blacksmith,  dreadfully torn about the throat, and quite dead.\"    A dog, belonging to the late Dr. Robert Hooper, had been in the  constant habit of performing various little personal services for his  master, such as fetching his slippers, &c. It happened one day that  Dr. Hooper had been detained by his professional duties much beyond  his usual dinner hour. The dog impatiently waited for his arrival, and  he at last returned, weary and hungry. After showing his pleasure at  the arrival of his master, greeting him with his usual attention, the  animal remained tolerably quiet until he conceived a reasonable time  had elapsed for the preparation of the Doctor's dinner. As it did not,  however, make its appearance, the dog went into the kitchen, seized  with his mouth a half-broiled beefsteak, with which he hastened back  to his master, placing it on the table-cloth before him.    A few years ago, the public were amused with an account given in the  newspapers of a dog which possessed the strange fancy of attending all  the fires that occurred in the metropolis. The discovery of this  predilection was made by a gentleman residing a few miles from town,  who was called up in the middle of the night by the intelligence that  the premises adjoining his house of business were on fire. \"The  removal of my books and papers,\" said he, in telling the story, \"of  course claimed my attention; yet, notwithstanding this, and the bustle  which prevailed, my eye every now and then rested on a dog, which,  during the hottest progress of the conflagration, I could not help  noticing running about, and apparently taking a deep interest in what  was going on; contriving to keep himself out of everybody's way, and  yet always present amidst the thickest of the stir. When the fire was  got under, and I had leisure to look about me, I again observed the  dog, which, with the firemen, appeared to be resting from the fatigues  of duty, and was led to make some inquiries respecting him. 'Is this  your dog, my friend?' said I to a fireman. 'No, sir,' answered he; it  does not belong to me, or to any one in particular. We call him the  firemen's dog.' 'The firemen's dog!' I replied. 'Why so? Has he no  master?' 'No, sir,' rejoined the fireman; 'he calls none of us master,  though we are all of us willing enough to give him a night's lodging  and a pennyworth of meat. But he won't stay long with any of us. His  delight is to be at all the fires in London; and, far or near, we  generally find him on the road as we are going along, and sometimes,  if it is out of town, we give him a lift. I don't think there has been  a fire for these two or three years past which he has not been at.'    \"The communication was so extraordinary, that I found it difficult to  believe the story, until it was confirmed by the concurrent testimony  of several other firemen. None of them, however, were able to give any  account of the early habits of the dog, or to offer any explanation of  the circumstances which led to this singular propensity.    \"Some time afterwards, I was again called up in the night to a fire in  the village in which I resided (Camberwell, in Surrey), and to my  surprise here I again met with 'the firemen's dog,' still alive and  well, pursuing, with the same apparent interest and satisfaction, the  exhibition of that which seldom fails to bring with it disaster and  misfortune, oftentimes loss of life and ruin. Still, he called no man  master, disdained to receive bed or board from the same hand more than  a night or two at a time, nor could the firemen trace out his  resting-place.\"    Such was the account of this interesting animal as it appeared in the  newspapers, to which were shortly afterwards appended several  circumstances communicated by a fireman at one of the police offices.  A magistrate having asked him whether it was a fact that the dog was  present at most of the fires that occurred in the metropolis, the  fireman replied that he never knew \"Tyke,\" as he was called, to be  absent from a fire upon any occasion that he (the fireman) attended  himself. The magistrate said the dog must have an extraordinary  predilection for fires. He then asked what length of time he had been  known to possess that propensity. The fireman replied that he knew  Tyke for the last nine years; and although he was getting old, yet the  moment the engines were about, Tyke was to be seen as active as ever,  running off in the direction of the fire. The magistrate inquired  whether the dog lived with any particular fireman. The fireman replied  that Tyke liked one fireman as well as another; he had no particular  favourites, but passed his time amongst them, sometimes going to the  house of one, and then to another, and off to a third when he was  tired. Day or night, it was all the same to him; if a fire broke out,  there he was in the midst of the bustle, running from one engine to  another, anxiously looking after the firemen; and, although pressed  upon by crowds, yet, from his dexterity, he always escaped accidents,  only now and then getting a ducking from the engines, which he rather  liked than otherwise. The magistrate said that Tyke was a most  extraordinary animal; and having expressed a wish to see him, he was  shortly after exhibited at the office, and some other peculiarities  respecting him were related. There was nothing at all particular in  the appearance of the dog; he was a rough-looking small animal, of the  terrier breed, and seemed to be in excellent condition, no doubt from  the care taken of him by the firemen belonging to the different  companies. There was some difficulty experienced in bringing him to  the office, as he did not much relish going any distance from where  the firemen are usually to be found, except in cases of attending with  them at a conflagration, and then distance was of no consequence. It  was found necessary to use stratagem for the purpose. A fireman  commenced running. Tyke, accustomed to follow upon such occasions, set  out after him; but this person, having slackened his pace on the way,  the sagacious animal, knowing there was no fire, turned back, and it  was necessary to carry him to the office.    The following striking anecdote, of a similar kind, appeared in the  first number of the new issue of Cassell's \"Illustrated Family  Paper.\" After giving a short account of a fire-escape man, named  Samuel Wood, the writer thus alludes to his dog Bill:--    \"As to Bill, he regards him evidently in the light of a friend; he had  him when he was a pup from a poor fellow who died in the service, and  he and his 'Bill' have been on excellent terms ever since.    \"The fire-escape man's dog takes after his master in courage and  perseverance. He is of the terrier breed, six years old. An alarm of  fire calls forth all his energy. He is the first to know that  something is wrong--the first to exert himself in setting it right. He  has not been trained to the work--'it is a gift,' as his master says;  and if we all used our gifts as efficiently as the dog Bill, it would  be the better for us. On an alarm of fire Bill barks his loudest,  dashes about in a frantic manner, till his master and the escape are  on their way to it. He, of course, is there first, giving the police  and the crowd to understand that Wood and his fire-escape are coming.  When the escape is fixed, and Wood begins to ascend the ladder, Bill  runs up the canvas; as soon as a window is opened, Bill leaps in and  dashes about to find the occupants, loudly barking for assistance as  soon as he has accomplished his errand of mercy. His watchfulness and  sagacity are never at fault, although on more than one occasion he has  stood a fair chance of losing his life,"]]]
