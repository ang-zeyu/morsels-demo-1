[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#11)"],[1,"man was the same, the bargain was soon struck: the page bound  himself by the most terrible oaths to keep the secret; and the marquis,  in order to supply whatever assistance was in his power, gave him money  to spend, believing that there was no woman, however virtuous, who could  resist the combination of youth, beauty, and fortune: unhappily for the  marquis, such a woman, whom he thought impossible, did exist, and was  his wife.    The page was so anxious to obey his master, that from that very day his  mistress remarked the alteration that arose from the permission given  him--his prompt obedience to her orders and his speed in executing them,  in order to return a few moments the sooner to her presence. She was  grateful to him, and in the simplicity of her heart she thanked him. Two  days later the page appeared before her splendidly dressed; she observed  and remarked upon his improved appearance, and amused herself in conning  over all the parts of his dress, as she might have done with a new doll.  All this familiarity doubled the poor young man's passion, but he stood  before his mistress, nevertheless, abashed and trembling, like Cherubino  before his fair godmother. Every evening the marquis inquired into his  progress, and every evening the page confessed that he was no farther  advanced than the day before; then the marquis scolded, threatened to  take away his fine clothes, to withdraw his own promises, and finally to  address himself to some other person. At this last threat the youth  would again call up his courage, and promise to be bolder to-morrow; and  on the morrow would spend the day in making a thousand compliments to  his mistress's eyes, which she, in her innocence, did not understand. At  last, one day, Madame de Perrant asked him what made him look at her  thus, and he ventured to confess his love; but then Madame de Perrant,  changing her whole demeanour, assumed a face of sternness and bade him  go out of her room.    The poor lover obeyed, and ran, in despair, to confide his grief to the  husband, who appeared sincerely to share it, but consoled him by saying  that he had no doubt chosen his moment badly; that all women, even the  least severe, had inauspicious hours in which they would not yield to  attack, and that he must let a few days pass, which he must employ in  making his peace, and then must take advantage of a better opportunity,  and not allow himself to be rebuffed by a few refusals; and to these  words the marquis added a purse of gold, in order that the page might,  if necessary, win over the marquise's waiting-woman.    Guided thus by the older experience of the husband, the page began to  appear very much ashamed and very penitent; but for a day or two the  marquise, in spite of his apparent humility, kept him at a distance: at  last, reflecting no doubt, with the assistance of her mirror and of her  maid, that the crime was not absolutely unpardonable, and after having  reprimanded the culprit at some length, while he stood listening with  eyes cast down, she gave a him her hand, forgave him, and admitted him  to her companionship as before.    Things went on in this way for a week. The page no longer raised his  eyes and did not venture to open his mouth, and the marquise was  beginning to regret the time in which he used to look and to speak,  when, one fine day while she was at her toilet, at which she had allowed  him to be present, he seized a moment when the maid had left her alone,  to cast himself at her feet and tell her that he had vainly tried to  stifle his love, and that, even although he were to die under the weight  of her anger, he must tell her that this love was immense, eternal,  stronger than his life. The marquise upon this wished to send him away,  as on the former occasion, but instead of obeying her, the page, better  instructed, took her in his arms. The marquise called, screamed, broke  her bell-rope; the waiting-maid, who had been bought over, according to  the marquis's advice, had kept the other women out of the way, and was  careful not to come herself. Then the marquise, resisting force by  force, freed herself from the page's arms, rushed to her husband's room,  and there, bare-necked, with floating hair, and looking lovelier than  ever, flung herself into his arms and begged his protection against the  insolent fellow who had just insulted her. But what was the amazement of  the marquise, when, instead of the anger which she expected to see break  forth, the marquis answered coldly that what she was saying was  incredible, that he had always found the young man very well behaved,  and that, no doubt, having taken up some frivolous ground of resentment  against him, she was employing this means to get rid of him; but, he  added, whatever might be his love for her, and his desire to do  everything that was agreeable to her, he begged her not to require this  of him, the young man being his friend's son, and consequently his own  adopted child. It was now the marquise who, in her turn, retired  abashed, not knowing what to make of such a reply, and fully resolving,  since her husband's protection failed her, to keep herself well guarded  by her own severity.    Indeed, from that moment the marquise behaved to the poor youth with so  much prudery, that, loving her as he did, sincerely, he would have died  of grief, if he had not had the marquis at hand to encourage and  strengthen him. Nevertheless, the latter himself began to despair, and  to be more troubled by the virtue of his wife than another man might  have been by the levity of his. Finally, he resolved, seeing that  matters remained at the same point and that the marquise did not relax  in the smallest degree, to take extreme measures. He hid his page in a  closet of his wife's bedchamber, and, rising during her first sleep,  left empty his own place beside her, went out softly, double-locked the  door, and listened attentively to hear what would happen.    He had not been listening thus for ten minutes when he heard a great  noise in the room, and the page trying in vain to appease it. The  marquis hoped that he might succeed, but the noise increasing, showed  him that he was again to be disappointed; soon came cries for help, for  the marquise could not ring, the bell-ropes having been lifted out of  her reach, and no one answering her cries, he heard her spring from her  high bed, run to the door, and finding it locked rush to the window,  which she tried to open: the scene had come to its climax.    The marquis decided to go in, lest some tragedy should happen, or lest  his wife's screams should reach some belated passer-by, who next day  would make him the talk of the town. Scarcely did the marquise behold  him when she threw herself into his arms, and pointing to the page,  said:--    \"Well, monsieur, will you still hesitate to free me from this insolent  wretch?\"    \"Yes, madame,\" replied the marquis; \"for this insolent wretch has been  acting for the last three months not only with my sanction but even by  my orders.\"    The marquise remained stupefied. Then the marquis, without sending away  the page, gave his wife an explanation of all that had passed, and  besought her to yield to his desire of obtaining a successor, whom he  would regard as his own child, so long as it was hers; but young though  she was, the marquise answered with a dignity unusual at her age, that  his power over her had the limits that were set to it by law, and not  those that it might please him to set in their place, and that however  much she might wish to do what might be his pleasure, she would yet  never obey him at the expense of her soul and her honour.    So positive an answer, while it filled her husband with despair, proved  to him that he must renounce the hope of obtaining an heir; but since  the page was not to blame for this, he fulfilled the promise that he had  made, bought him a regiment, and resigned himself to having the most  virtuous wife in France. His repentance was not, however, of long  duration; he died at the end of three months, after having confided to  his friend, the Marquis d'Urban, the cause of his sorrows.    The Marquis d'Urban had a son of marriageable age; he thought that he  could find nothing more suitable for him than a wife whose virtue had  come triumphantly through such a trial: he let her time of mourning  pass, and then presented the young Marquis d'Urban, who succeeded in  making his attentions acceptable to the beautiful widow, and soon became  her husband. More fortunate than his predecessor, the Marquis d'Urban  had three heirs to oppose to his collaterals, when, some two years and a  half later, the Chevalier de Bouillon arrived at the capital of the  county of Venaissin.    The Chevalier de Bouillon was a typical rake of the period, handsome,  young, and well-grown; the nephew of a cardinal who was influential at  Rome, and proud of belonging to a house which had privileges of  suzerainty. The chevalier, in his indiscreet fatuity, spared no woman;  and his conduct had given some scandal in the circle of Madame de  Maintenon, who was rising into power. One of his friends, having  witnessed the displeasure exhibited towards him by Louis XIV, who was  beginning to become devout, thought to do him a service by warning him  that the king \"gardait une dent\" against him. [ Translator's  note.--\"Garder une dent,\" that is, to keep up a grudge, means literally  \"to keep a tooth\" against him.]    \"Pardieu!\" replied the chevalier, \"I am indeed unlucky when the only  tooth left to him remains to bite me.\"    This pun had been repeated, and had reached Louis XIV, so that the  chevalier presently heard, directly enough this time, that the king  desired him to travel for some years. He knew the danger of  neglecting--such intimations, and since he thought the country after all  preferable to the Bastille, he left Paris, and arrived at Avignon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#11)"],[1,"you  take in the plates--I will not disturb your studies.\"    \"Thank you.\"    \"But on one condition; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is.\"    \"Oh! willingly; in his own room. Only--\"    \"Only that one can't enter it?\"    \"Unapproachable.\"    \"For everybody?\"    \"Everybody. He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my  observations, and then he went away.\"    \"Well, my dear Monsieur Moliere, but you will go and tell him I am  here.\"    \"I!\" exclaimed Moliere, in the tone of a courageous dog, from which  you snatch the bone it has legitimately gained; \"I disturb myself! Ah!  Monsieur d'Artagnan, how hard you are upon me!\"    \"If you don't go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here, my dear  Moliere,\" said D'Artagnan, in a low tone, \"I warn you of one thing: that  I won't exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me.\"    Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture, \"This gentleman,  is it not?\"    \"Yes.\"    Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds  and hearts of men. The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one,  for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber.        Chapter IV. The Patterns.    During all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away, leaving at  every angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace, as the waves  leave foam or scattered seaweed on the sands, when they retire with the  ebbing tide. In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared, making another  sign to D'Artagnan from under the hangings. The latter hurried after  him, with Porthos in the rear, and after threading a labyrinth of  corridors, introduced him to M. Percerin's room. The old man, with his  sleeves turned up, was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered  brocade, so as the better to exhibit its luster. Perceiving D'Artagnan,  he put the silk aside, and came to meet him, by no means radiant with  joy, and by no means courteous, but, take it altogether, in a tolerably  civil manner.    \"The captain of the king's musketeers will excuse me, I am sure, for I  am engaged.\"    \"Eh! yes, on the king's costumes; I know that, my dear Monsieur  Percerin. You are making three, they tell me.\"    \"Five, my dear sir, five.\"    \"Three or five, 'tis all the same to me, my dear monsieur; and I know  that you will make them most exquisitely.\"    \"Yes, I know. Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world,  I do not deny it; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word,  they must first be made; and to do this, captain, I am pressed for  time.\"    \"Oh, bah! there are two days yet; 'tis much more than you require,  Monsieur Percerin,\" said D'Artagnan, in the coolest possible manner.    Percerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be  contradicted, even in his whims; but D'Artagnan did not pay the least  attention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume.    \"My dear M. Percerin,\" he continued, \"I bring you a customer.\"    \"Ah! ah!\" exclaimed Percerin, crossly.    \"M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,\" continued  D'Artagnan. Percerin attempted a bow, which found no favor in the eyes  of the terrible Porthos, who, from his first entry into the room, had  been regarding the tailor askance.    \"A very good friend of mine,\" concluded D'Artagnan.    \"I will attend to monsieur,\" said Percerin, \"but later.\"    \"Later? but when?\"    \"When I have time.\"    \"You have already told my valet as much,\" broke in Porthos,  discontentedly.    \"Very likely,\" said Percerin; \"I am nearly always pushed for time.\"    \"My friend,\" returned Porthos, sententiously, \"there is always time to  be found when one chooses to seek it.\"    Percerin turned crimson; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by  age.    \"Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere.\"    \"Come, come, Percerin,\" interposed D'Artagnan, \"you are not in a good  temper to-day. Well, I will say one more word to you, which will bring  you on your knees; monsieur is not only a friend of mine, but more, a  friend of M. Fouquet's.\"    \"Ah! ah!\" exclaimed the tailor, \"that is another thing.\" Then turning  to Porthos, \"Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent?\" he  inquired.    \"I am attached to myself,\" shouted Porthos, at the very moment that the  tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue. Moliere  was all observation, D'Artagnan laughed, Porthos swore.    \"My dear Percerin,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you will make a dress for the  baron. 'Tis I who ask you.\"    \"To you I will not say nay, captain.\"    \"But that is not all; you will make it for him at once.\"    \"'Tis impossible within eight days.\"    \"That, then, is as much as to refuse, because the dress is wanted for  the _fete_ at Vaux.\"    \"I repeat that it is impossible,\" returned the obstinate old man.    \"By no means, dear Monsieur Percerin, above all if _I_ ask you,\" said a  mild voice at the door, a silvery voice which made D'Artagnan prick up  his ears. It was the voice of Aramis.    \"Monsieur d'Herblay!\" cried the tailor.    \"Aramis,\" murmured D'Artagnan.    \"Ah! our bishop!\" said Porthos.    \"Good morning, D'Artagnan; good morning, Porthos; good-morning, my dear  friends,\" said Aramis. \"Come, come, M. Percerin, make the baron's  dress; and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet.\" And he  accompanied the words with a sign, which seemed to say, \"Agree, and  dismiss them.\"    It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior  even to D'Artagnan's, for the tailor bowed in assent, and turning round  upon Porthos, said, \"Go and get measured on the other side.\"    Porthos colored in a formidable manner. D'Artagnan saw the storm coming,  and addressing Moliere, said to him, in an undertone, \"You see before  you, my dear monsieur, a man who considers himself disgraced, if you  measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him; study this type  for me, Master Aristophanes, and profit by it.\"    Moliere had no need of encouragement, and his gaze dwelt long and keenly  on the Baron Porthos. \"Monsieur,\" he said, \"if you will come with me, I  will make them take your measure without touching you.\"    \"Oh!\" said Porthos, \"how do you make that out, my friend?\"    \"I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of  your dress. It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of  quality, who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch  them. We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being  measured, a process which, as I think, wounds the natural dignity of a  man; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these--\"    \"_Corboeuf!_ I believe I am too!\"    \"Well, that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence, and you shall  have the benefit of our invention.\"    \"But how in the world can it be done?\" asked Porthos, delighted.    \"Monsieur,\" said Moliere, bowing, \"if you will deign to follow me, you  will see.\"    Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes. Perhaps he fancied from  D'Artagnan's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos, so as not to  lose the conclusion of a scene well begun. But, clear-sighted as he was,  Aramis deceived himself. Porthos and Moliere left together: D'Artagnan  remained with Percerin. Why? From curiosity, doubtless; probably to  enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis. As Moliere  and Porthos disappeared, D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes, a  proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him.    \"A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?\"    Aramis smiled. \"No,\" said he.    \"You will go to Vaux, however?\"    \"I shall go, but without a new dress. You forget, dear D'Artagnan, that  a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every  _fete_.\"    \"Bah!\" said the musketeer, laughing, \"and do we write no more poems now,  either?\"    \"Oh! D'Artagnan,\" exclaimed Aramis, \"I have long ago given up all such  tomfoolery.\"    \"True,\" repeated D'Artagnan, only half convinced. As for Percerin, he  was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades.    \"Don't you perceive,\" said Aramis, smiling, \"that we are greatly boring  this good gentleman, my dear D'Artagnan?\"    \"Ah! ah!\" murmured the musketeer, aside; \"that is, I am boring you,  my friend.\" Then aloud, \"Well, then, let us leave; I have no further  business here, and if you are as disengaged as I, Aramis--\"    \"No, not I--I wished--\"    \"Ah! you had something particular to say to M. Percerin? Why did you not  tell me so at once?\"    \"Something particular, certainly,\" repeated Aramis, \"but not for you,  D'Artagnan. But, at the same time, I hope you will believe that I can  never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not  hear it.\"    \"Oh, no, no! I am going,\" said D'Artagnan, imparting to his voice an  evident tone of curiosity; for Aramis's annoyance, well dissembled as it  was, had not a whit escaped him; and he knew that, in that impenetrable  mind, every thing, even the most apparently trivial, was designed to  some end; an unknown one, but an end that, from the knowledge he had of  his friend's character, the musketeer felt must be important.    On his part, Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion, and  pressed him. \"Stay, by all means,\" he said, \"this is what it is.\" Then  turning towards the tailor, \"My dear Percerin,\" said he,--\"I am even  very happy that you are here, D'Artagnan.\"    \"Oh, indeed,\" exclaimed the Gascon, for the third time, even less  deceived this time than before.    Percerin never moved. Aramis roused him violently, by snatching from his  hands the stuff upon which he was engaged. \"My dear Percerin,\" said he,  \"I have, near hand, M. Lebrun, one of M. Fouquet's painters.\"    \"Ah, very good,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"but why Lebrun?\"    Aramis looked at D'Artagnan, who seemed to be occupied with an engraving  of Mark Antony. \"And you wish that I should make him a"]]]
