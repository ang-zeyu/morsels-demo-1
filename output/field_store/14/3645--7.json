This would have looked awkward, if there had  been the least appearance of its being an accidental error; so that, in  order to draw the eye to it, and show that it is done on purpose, the  upper triangles are made about two inches higher than the lower ones, so  as to be much more acute in proportion and effect, and actually to  look considerably narrower, though of the same width at the base. By  this means they are made lighter in effect, and subordinated to the  richly decorated series of the lower band, and the two courses, instead  of repeating, unite with each other, and become a harmonious whole.    [Illustration: Plate V.                 Archivolt in the Duomo of Murano.]    In order, however, to make still more sure that this difference in the  height of the triangles should not escape the eye, another course of  plain bricks is added above their points, increasing the width of the  band by another two inches. There are five courses of bricks in the  lower band, and it measures 1 ft. 6 in. in height: there are seven  courses in the upper (of which six fall between the triangles), and it  measures 1 ft. 10 in. in height, except at the extremity of the northern  aisle, where for some mysterious reason the intermediate cornice is  sloped upwards so as to reduce the upper triangles to the same height as  those below. And here, finally, observe how determined the builder was  that the one series should not be a mere imitation of the other; he  could not now make them acute by additional height--so he here, and here  only, _narrowed their bases_, and we have seven of them above, to six  below.    Sec. XXVII. We come now to the most interesting portion of the whole east  end, the archivolt at the end of the northern aisle.    It was above stated, that the band of triangles was broken by two higher  arches at the ends of the aisles. That, however, on the northern side of  the apse does not entirely interrupt, but lifts it, and thus forms a  beautiful and curious archivolt, drawn opposite, in Plate V. The upper  band of triangles cannot rise together with the lower, as it would  otherwise break the cornice prepared to receive the second story; and  the curious zigzag with which its triangles die away against the sides  of the arch, exactly as waves break upon the sand, is one of the most  curious features in the structure.    It will be also seen that there is a new feature in the treatment of the  band itself when it turns the arch. Instead of leaving the bricks  projecting between the sculptured or colored stones, reversed triangles  of marble are used, inlaid to an equal depth with the others in the  brickwork, but projecting beyond them so as to produce a sharp dark line  of zigzag at their junctions. Three of these supplementary stones have  unhappily fallen out, so that it is now impossible to determine the full  harmony of color in which they were originally arranged. The central  one, corresponding to the keystone in a common arch, is, however, most  fortunately left, with two lateral ones on the right hand, and one on  the left.    Sec. XXVIII. The keystone, if it may be so called, is of white marble,  the lateral voussoirs of purple; and these are the only colored stones  in the whole building which are sculptured; but they are sculptured in a  way which, more satisfactorily proves that the principle above stated  was understood by the builders, than if they had been left blank. The  object, observe, was to make the archivolt as rich as possible; eight of  the white sculptured marbles were used upon it in juxtaposition. Had the  purple marbles been left altogether plain, they would have been out of  harmony with the elaboration of the rest. It became necessary to touch  them with sculpture as a mere sign of carefulness and finish, but at the  same time destroying their colored surface as little as possible. _The  ornament is merely outlined upon them with a fine incision_, as if it  had been etched out on their surface preparatory to being carved. In two  of them it is composed merely of three concentric lines, parallel with  the sides of the triangle; in the third, it is a wreath of beautiful  design, which I have drawn of larger size in fig. 2, Plate V., that the  reader may see how completely the surface is left undestroyed by the  delicate incisions of the chisel, and may compare the method of working  with that employed on the white stones, two of which are given in that  plate, figs. 4 and 5. The keystone, of which we have not yet spoken, is  the only white stone worked with the light incision; its design not  being capable of the kind of workmanship given to the floral ornaments,  and requiring either to be carved in complete relief, or left as we see  it. It is given at fig. 1 of Plate IV. The sun and moon on each side of  the cross are, as we shall see in the fifth Chapter, constantly employed  on the keystones of Byzantine arches.    Sec. XXIX. We must not pass without notice the grey and green pieces of  marble inserted at the flanks of the arch. For, observe, there was a  difficulty in getting the forms of the triangle into anything like  reconciliation at this point, and a mediaeval artist always delights in a  difficulty: instead of concealing it, he boasts of it; and just as we  saw above that he directed the eye to the difficulty of filling the  expanded sides of the upper band by elongating his triangles, so here,  having to put in a piece of stone of awkward shape, he makes that very  stone the most conspicuous in the whole arch, on both sides, by using in  one case a dark, cold grey; in the other a vigorous green, opposed to  the warm red and purple and white of the stones above and beside it. The  green and white piece on the right is of a marble, as far as I know,  exceedingly rare. I at first thought the white fragments were inlaid, so  sharply are they defined upon their ground. They are indeed inlaid, but  I believe it is by nature; and that the stone is a calcareous breccia of  great mineralogical interest. The white spots are of singular value in  giving piquancy to the whole range of more delicate transitional hues  above. The effect of the whole is, however, generally injured by the  loss of the three large triangles above. I have no doubt they were  purple, like those which remain, and that the whole arch was thus one  zone of white, relieved on a purple ground, encircled by the scarlet  cornices of brick, and the whole chord of color contrasted by the two  precious fragments of grey and green at either side.    Sec. XXX. The two pieces of carved stone inserted at each side of the  arch, as seen at the bottom of Plate V., are of different workmanship from  the rest; they do not match each other, and form part of the evidence  which proves that portions of the church had been brought from the  mainland. One bears an inscription, which, as its antiquity is confirmed  by the shapelessness of its letters, I was much gratified by not being  able to read; but M. Lazari, the intelligent author of the latest and best  Venetian guide, with better skill, has given as much of it as remains,  thus:    [Illustration: T    SCEMARIEDIGENETRICISETBEATIESTEFANIMART                 IRIEGOINDIGNVSETPECCATURDOMENICUST]    I have printed the letters as they are placed in the inscription, in  order that the reader may form some idea of the difficulty of reading  such legends when the letters, thus thrown into one heap, are themselves  of strange forms, and half worn away; any gaps which at all occur  between them coming in the wrong places. There is no doubt, however, as  to the reading of this fragment:--\"T ... Sancte Marie Domini Genetricis  et beati Estefani martiri ego indignus et peccator Domenicus T.\" On  these two initial and final T's, expanding one into Templum, the other  into Torcellanus, M. Lazari founds an ingenious conjecture that the  inscription records the elevation of the church under a certain bishop  Dominic of Torcello (named in the Altinat Chronicle), who flourished in  the middle of the ninth century. If this were so, as the inscription  occurs broken off on a fragment inserted scornfully in the present  edifice, this edifice must be of the twelfth century, worked with  fragments taken from the ruins of that built in the ninth. The two T's  are, however, hardly a foundation large enough to build the church upon,  a hundred years before the date assigned to it both by history and  tradition (see above, Sec. VIII.): and the reader has yet to be made  aware of the principal fact bearing on the question.    Sec. XXXI. Above the first story of the apse runs, as he knows already,  a gallery under open arches, protected by a light balustrade. This  balustrade is worked on the _outside_ with mouldings, of which I shall  only say at present that they are of exactly the same school as the  greater part of the work of the existing church. But the great  horizontal pieces of stone which form the top of this balustrade are  fragments of an older building turned inside out. They are covered with  sculptures on the back, only to be seen by mounting into the gallery.  They have once had an arcade of low wide arches traced on their surface,  the spandrils filled with leafage, and archivolts enriched with studded  chainwork and with crosses in their centres. These pieces have been used  as waste marble by the architect of the existing apse. The small arches  of the present balustrade are cut mercilessly through the old work, and  the profile of the balustrade is cut out of what was once the back of  the stone; only some respect is shown for the crosses in the old design,  the blocks are cut so that these shall be not only left uninjured, but  come in the centre of the balustrades.    Sec. XXXII. Now let the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#11)"],[1,"and accurately to  see for themselves. It will in no wise take the place of this personal  sight. Nothing can be done well in art, except by vision. Scientific  principles and experiences are helps to the eye, as a microscope is; and  they are of exactly as much use _without_ the eye. No science of  perspective, or of anything else, will enable us to draw the simplest  natural line accurately, unless we see it and feel it. Science is soon  at her wits' end. All the professors of perspective in Europe, could  not, by perspective, draw the line of curve of a sea beach; nay, could  not outline one pool of the quiet water left among the sand. The eye and  hand can do it, nothing else. All the rules of aerial perspective that  ever were written, will not tell me how sharply the pines on the  hill-top are drawn at this moment on the sky. I shall know if I see  them, and love them; not till then. I may study the laws of atmospheric  gradation for fourscore years and ten, and I shall not be able to draw  so much as a brick-kiln through its own smoke, unless I look at it; and  that in an entirely humble and unscientific manner, ready to see all  that the smoke, my master, is ready to show me, and expecting to see  nothing more.    Sec. XIX. So that all the knowledge a man has must be held cheap, and  neither trusted nor respected, the moment he comes face to face with  Nature. If it help him, well; if not, but, on the contrary, thrust  itself upon him in an impertinent and contradictory temper, and venture  to set itself in the slightest degree in opposition to, or comparison  with, his sight, let it be disgraced forthwith. And the slave is less  likely to take too much upon herself, if she has not been bought for a  high price. All the knowledge an artist needs, will, in these days, come  to him almost without his seeking; if he has far to look for it, he may  be sure he does not want it. Prout became Prout, without knowing a  single rule of perspective to the end of his days; and all the  perspective in the Encyclopaedia will never produce us another Prout.    Sec. XX. And observe, also, knowledge is not only very often unnecessary,  but it is often _untrustworthy_. It is inaccurate, and betrays us where  the eye would have been true to us. Let us take the single instance of  the knowledge of aerial perspective, of which the moderns are so proud,  and see how it betrays us in various ways. First by the conceit of it,  which often prevents our enjoying work in which higher and better things  were thought of than effects of mist. The other day I showed a line  impression of Albert Durer's \"St. Hubert\" to a modern engraver, who had  never seen it nor any other of Albert Durer's works. He looked at it for  a minute contemptuously, then turned away: \"Ah, I see that man did not  know much about aerial perspective!\" All the glorious work and thought  of the mighty master, all the redundant landscape, the living  vegetation, the magnificent truth of line, were dead letters to him,  because he happened to have been taught one particular piece of  knowledge which Durer despised.    Sec. XXI. But not only in the conceit of it, but in the inaccuracy of  it, this science betrays us. Aerial perspective, as given by the modern  artist, is, in nine cases out of ten, a gross and ridiculous  exaggeration, as is demonstrable in a moment. The effect of air in  altering the hue and depth of color is of course great in the exact  proportion of the volume of air between the observer and the object. It  is not violent within the first few yards, and then diminished  gradually, but it is equal for each foot of interposing air. Now in a  clear day, and clear climate, such as that generally presupposed in a  work of fine color, objects are completely visible at a distance of ten  miles; visible in light and shade, with gradations between the two.  Take, then, the faintest possible hue of shadow, or of any color, and  the most violent and positive possible, and set them side by side. The  interval between them is greater than the real difference (for objects  may often be seen clearly much farther than ten miles, I have seen Mont  Blanc at 120) caused by the ten miles of intervening air between any  given hue of the nearest, and most distant, objects; but let us assume  it, in courtesy to the masters of aerial perspective, to be the real  difference. Then roughly estimating a mile at less than it really is,  also in courtesy to them, or at 5000 feet, we have this difference  between tints produced by 50,000 feet of air. Then, ten feet of air  will produce the 5000th part of this difference. Let the reader take the  two extreme tints, and carefully gradate the one into the other. Let him  divide this gradated shadow or color into 5000 successive parts; and the  difference in depth between one of these parts and the next is the exact  amount of aerial perspective between one object, and another, ten feet  behind it, on a clear day.    Sec. XXII. Now, in Millais' \"Huguenot,\" the figures were standing about  three feet from the wall behind them; and the wise world of critics,  which could find no other fault with the picture, professed to have its  eyes hurt by the want of an aerial perspective, which, had it been  accurately given (as, indeed, I believe it was), would have amounted to  the 10/3-5000th, or less than the 15,000th part of the depth of any  given color. It would be interesting to see a picture painted by the  critics, upon this scientific principle. The aerial perspective usually  represented is entirely conventional and ridiculous; a mere struggle on  the part of the pretendedly well-informed, but really ignorant, artist,  to express distances by mist which he cannot by drawing.    It is curious that the critical world is just as much offended by the  true _presence_ of aerial perspective, over distances of fifty miles,  and with definite purpose of representing mist, in the works of Turner,  as by the true _absence_ of aerial perspective, over distances of three  feet, and in clear weather, in those of Millais.    Sec. XXIII. \"Well but,\" still answers the reader, \"this kind of error  may here and there be occasioned by too much respect for undigested  knowledge; but, on the whole, the gain is greater than the loss, and the  fact is, that a picture of the Renaissance period, or by a modern  master, does indeed represent nature more faithfully than one wrought in  the ignorance of old times.\" No, not one whit; for the most part less  faithfully. Indeed, the outside of nature is more truly drawn; the  material commonplace, which can be systematized, catalogued, and taught  to all pains-taking mankind,--forms of ribs and scapulae,[12] of eyebrows  and lips, and curls of hair. Whatever can be measured and handled,  dissected and demonstrated,--in a word, whatever is of the body  only,--that the schools of knowledge do resolutely and courageously  possess themselves of, and portray. But whatever is immeasurable,  intangible, indivisible, and of the spirit, that the schools of  knowledge do as certainly lose, and blot out of their sight, that is to  say, all that is worth art's possessing or recording at all; for  whatever can be arrested, measured, and systematized, we can contemplate  as much as we will in nature herself. But what we want art to do for us  is to stay what is fleeting, and to enlighten what is incomprehensible,  to incorporate the things that have no measure, and immortalize the  things that have no duration. The dimly seen, momentary glance, the  flitting shadow of faint emotion, the imperfect lines of fading thought,  and all that by and through such things as these is recorded on the  features of man, and all that in man's person and actions, and in the  great natural world, is infinite and wonderful; having in it that spirit  and power which man may witness, but not weigh; conceive, but not  comprehend; love, but not limit; and imagine, but not define;--this, the  beginning and the end of the aim of all noble art, we have, in the  ancient art, by perception; and we have _not_, in the newer art, by  knowledge. Giotto gives it us, Orcagna gives it us. Angelico, Memmi,  Pisano, it matters not who,--all simple and unlearned men, in their  measure and manner,--give it us; and the learned men that followed them  give it us not, and we, in our supreme learning, own ourselves at this  day farther from it than ever.    Sec. XXIV. \"Nay,\" but it is still answered, \"this is because we have not  yet brought our knowledge into right use, but have been seeking to  accumulate it, rather than to apply it wisely to the ends of art. Let us  now do this, and we may achieve all that was done by that elder ignorant  art, and infinitely more.\" No, not so; for as soon as we try to put our  knowledge to good use, we shall find that we have much more than we can  use, and that what more we have is an encumbrance. All our errors in  this respect arise from a gross misconception as to the true nature of  knowledge itself. We talk of learned and ignorant men, as if there were  a certain quantity of knowledge, which to possess was to be learned, and  which not to possess was to be ignorant; instead of considering that  knowledge is infinite, and that the man most learned in human estimation  is just as far from knowing anything as he ought to know it, as the  unlettered peasant. Men are merely on a lower or higher stage of an  eminence, whose summit is God's throne, infinitely above all; and there  is just as much reason for the wisest as for the simplest man being  discontented with his position, as respects the real quantity of  knowledge he possesses. And, for both of them, the only true reasons for  contentment with the sum of knowledge they possess are these: that it is  the kind of knowledge they need for their duty and happiness in life;  that all they have is tested and certain, so far as it is in their  power; that all they have is "]]]
