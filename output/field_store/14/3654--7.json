For a long time she persisted in her denial, but at  length in a moment of weakness, when the children had come out of their  fits at her chance exhortation to them, she became convinced that she  was guilty and exclaimed, \"O sir, I have been the cause of all this  trouble to your children.\" The woman, who up to this time had shown some  spirit, had broken down. She now confessed that she had given her soul  to the Devil. A clergyman was hastily sent for, who preached a sermon of  repentance, upon which the distracted woman made a public confession.  But on the next day, after she had been refreshed by sleep and had been  in her own home again, she denied her confession. The constable now  prepared to take the woman as well as her daughter to the Bishop of  Lincoln, and the frightened creature again made a confession. In the  presence of the bishop she reiterated her story in detail and gave the  names of her spirits. She was put in gaol at Huntingdon and with her  were imprisoned her daughter Agnes and her husband John Samuel, who were  now accused by the Throckmorton children, and all three were tried at  the assizes in Huntingdon before Judge Fenner. The facts already  narrated were given in evidence, the seizures of the children at the  appearance of any of the Samuel family[22], the certainty with which the  children could with closed eyes pick Mother Samuel out of a crowd and  scratch her, the confessions of the crazed creature, all these evidences  were given to the court. But the strongest proof was that given in the  presence of the court. The daughter Agnes Samuel was charged to repeat,  \"As I am a witch and consenting to the death of Lady Cromwell, I charge  thee, come out of her.\"[23] At this charge the children would at once  recover from their fits. But a charge phrased negatively, \"As I am no  witch,\" was ineffectual. And the affirmative charge, when tried by some  other person, had no result. This was deemed conclusive proof. The woman  was beyond doubt guilty. The same method was applied with equally  successful issue to the father. When he refused to use the words of the  charge he was warned by the judge that he would endanger his life. He  gave way.    It is needless to say that the grand jury arraigned all three of the  family and that the \"jury of life and death\" found them guilty. It  needed but a five hours' trial.[24] The mother was induced to plead  pregnancy as a delay to execution, but after an examination by a jury  was adjudged not pregnant. The daughter had been urged to make the same  defence, but spiritedly replied, \"It shall never be said that I was both  a witch and a whore.\" At the execution the mother made another  confession, in which she implicated her husband, but refused to the end  to accuse her daughter.    From beginning to end it had been the strong against the weak. Sir  Robert Throckmorton, Sir Henry Cromwell, William Wickham, Bishop of  Lincoln, the justices of the peace, Justice Fenner of the king's court,  the Cambridge scholars, the \"Doctor of Divinitie,\" and two other  clergymen, all were banded together against this poor but respectable  family. In some respects the trial reminds us of one that was to take  place ninety-nine years later in Massachusetts. The part played by the  children in the two instances was very similar. Mother Samuel had hit  the nail on the head when she said that the trouble was due to the  children's \"wantonness.\" Probably the first child had really suffered  from some slight ailment. The others were imitators eager to gain notice  and pleased with their success; and this fact was realized by some  people at the time. \"It had been reported by some in the county, those  that thought themselves wise, that this Mother Samuel ... was an old  simple woman, and that one might make her by fayre words confesse what  they would.\" Moreover the tone of the writer's defense makes it evident  that others beside Mother Samuel laid the action of the Throckmorton  children to \"wantonness.\" And six years later Samuel Harsnett, chaplain  to the Bishop of London and a man already influential, called the  account of the affair \"a very ridiculous booke\" and evidently believed  the children guilty of the same pretences as William Somers, whose  confessions of imposture he was relating.[25]    We have already observed that the Warboys affair was the only celebrated  trial of its sort in the last part of Elizabeth's reign--that is, from  the time of Reginald Scot to the accession of James I. This does not  mean that the superstition was waning or that the trials were on the  decrease. The records show that the number of trials was steadily  increasing. They were more widely distributed. London was still the  centre of the belief. Chief-Justice Anderson sent Joan Kerke to Tyburn  and the Middlesex sessions were still occupied with accusations. The  counties adjacent to it could still claim more than two-thirds of the  executions. But a far wider area was infected with the superstition.  Norfolk in East Anglia, Leicester, Nottingham and Derby in the  Midlands, and York and Northumberland in the North were all involved.    The truth is that there are two tendencies that appear very clearly  towards the last part of Elizabeth's reign. On the one hand the feeling  of the people against witchcraft was growing in intensity, while on the  other the administration at London was inclined to be more lenient.  Pardons and reprieves were issued to women already condemned,[26] while  some attempt was made to curb popular excitement. The attitude of the  queen towards the celebrated John Dee was an instance in point. Dee was  an eminent alchemist, astrologer, and spiritualist of his time. He has  left a diary which shows us his half mystic, half scientific pursuits.  In the earlier part of Mary's reign he had been accused of attempting  poison or magic against the queen and had been imprisoned and examined  by the privy council and by the Star Chamber. At Elizabeth's accession  he had cast the horoscope for her coronation day, and he was said to  have revealed to the queen who were her enemies at foreign courts. More  than once afterwards Dee was called upon by the queen to render her  services when she was ill or when some mysterious design against her  person was feared. While he dealt with many curious things, he had  consistently refused to meddle with conjuring. Indeed he had rebuked the  conjurer Hartley and had refused to help the bewitched Margaret Byrom of  Cleworth in Lancashire. Sometime about 1590 Dee's enemies--and he had  many--put in circulation stories of his success as a conjurer. It was  the more easy to do, because for a long time he had been suspected by  many of unlawful dealings with spirits. His position became dangerous.  He appealed to Elizabeth for protection and she gave him assurance that  he might push on with his studies. Throughout her life the queen  continued to stand by Dee,[27] and it was not until a new sovereign came  to the throne that he again came into danger. But the moral of the  incident is obvious. The privy council, so nervous about the conjurers  in the days of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Catholic and Spanish plots,  was now resting easier and refused to be affrighted.    We have already referred to the pardons issued as one of the evidences  of the more lenient policy of the government. That policy appeared too  in the lessening rigor of the assize judges. The first half of  Elizabeth's reign had been marked by few acquittals. Nearly half the  cases of which we have record in the second part resulted in the  discharge of the accused. Whether the judges were taking their cue from  the privy council or whether some of them were feeling the same reaction  against the cruelty of the prosecutions, it is certain that there was a  considerable nullifying of the force of the belief. We shall see in the  chapter on Reginald Scot that his _Discoverie of Witchcraft_ was said to  have \"affected the magistracy and the clergy.\" It is hard to lay one's  finger upon influences of this sort, but we can hardly doubt that there  was some connection between Scot's brave indictment of the witch-triers  and the lessening severity of court verdicts. When George Gifford, the  non-conformist clergyman at Maiden, wrote his _Dialogue concerning  Witches_, in which he earnestly deprecated the conviction of so many  witches, he dedicated the book \"to the Right Worshipful Maister Robert  Clarke, one of her Maiesties Barons of her Highnesse Court of the  Exchequer,\" and wrote that he had been \"delighted to heare and see the  wise and godly course used upon the seate of justice by your worship,  when such have bene arraigned.\" Unfortunately there is not much evidence  of this kind.    One other fact must not be overlooked. A large percentage of the cases  that went against the accused were in towns judicially independent of  the assize courts. At Faversham, at Lynn, at Yarmouth, and at  Leicester[28] the local municipal authorities were to blame for the  hanging of witches. The regular assize courts had nothing to do with the  matter. The case at Faversham in Kent was unusual. Joan Cason was  indicted for bewitching to death a three-year-old child. Eight of her  neighbors, seven of them women, \"poore people,\" testified against her.  The woman took up her own cause with great spirit and exposed the  malicious dealings of her adversaries and also certain controversies  betwixt her and them. \"But although she satisfied the bench,\" says  Holinshed, \"and all the jurie touching hir innocencie ... she ...  confessed that a little vermin, being of colour reddish, of stature  lesse than a rat ... did ... haunt her house.\" She was willing too to  admit illicit relations with one Mason, whose housekeeper she had  been--probably the original cause of her troubles. The jury acquitted  her of witchcraft, but found her guilty of the \"invocation of evil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#11)"],[1,"--G. BERNARD SHAW.      'I don't believe in the existence of Puritan women. I don't think    there is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered    if one made love to her. It is that which makes woman so    irresistibly adorable.' --OSCAR WILDE.      If there be any readers whose susceptibilities are shocked by this  headline, they are respectfully requested--nay, commanded--to read no  further. If there be any whose susceptibilities waver without as yet  experiencing any actual shock, they are affectionately asked--nay,  implored--to re-read several times the above quotation from Mr Shaw's  immortal _Candida_, to thereupon pull themselves together and take the  plunge. I can promise them it won't be anything like as terrible as they  half hope--in fact its essential propriety will probably disappoint them  bitterly!    Curiously enough, though women are more anxious to marry than men,  and do everything in their power to achieve what men often strive to  resist--after marriage it is generally the woman who is most  discontented. Of late years a spirit of strange unrest has come over  married women, and they frequently rebel against conditions which our  grandmothers would never have dreamed of murmuring at. There are a  variety of causes for this: one that marriage falls short of women's  expectations, as I said in the opening chapter, another that they have  had no _feminine_ wild oats. Please note the qualifying adjective, duly  italicised, and do not attempt to misunderstand me. I am no advocate of  the licence generally accorded to men being extended to women.    'Wild oats' of this nature, otherwise an ante-hymeneal 'fling,' was  certainly not a necessity of our grandmothers, but a certain (fairly  numerous) type of modern women seem to make better wives when they have  reaped this harvest. Take for example the cases of Yvonne and Yvette  which are personally known to me. Yvette was engaged at eighteen and  married at twenty-one. At the age of twenty-six she was the mother of  four children. She had scarcely time to realise what youth meant and  begin to enjoy it before her girlhood was stifled under the  responsibilities of marriage and maternity. She had accepted her first  offer, and he was practically the only man she knew anything of. Beyond  him she had seen nothing of men, or of the world; certainly she had  never flirted or had men friends or enjoyed any admiration but that of  her _fiance_.    At twenty-six Yvette began to realise that she had been cheated out of a  very precious part of life and an invaluable experience. Though a fairly  happy wife and a devoted mother, she felt that she might have had those  lost delights as well as the domestic joys, and the knowledge enraged  her.    A dangerous spirit of curiosity entered her heart, and a still more  dangerous longing for adventure and excitement. She realised that there  were other men in the world who admired her besides her Marcus, and that  she was pretty and still quite a young woman. At thirty Yvette was a  mistress of the art of intrigue--had engineered several dangerous  _affaires_, and might have come to serious grief had not Marcus been a  singularly wise, tender, and understanding husband.    'It isn't that I don't love him dearly,' she confided in me when  resolving to turn over a new leaf. 'I wouldn't exchange him for anyone  in the world, and you know what the children are to me--but somehow I  want something else as well--some excitement. I feel I've had no _fun_  in my life, and I wanted to have a fling before it was too late. When I  was engaged I scarcely ever even danced with anyone but Marcus, and for  the first four years of my married life I had a baby every eighteen  months--it was nothing but babies, nursing the old one and getting ready  for the new one! Not that I didn't love it, but the reaction was bound  to come, and it did. If only I could have had the excitement and the  gaiety and the glamour first, and then married when I was about  twenty-five, I should have been perfectly satisfied then, like Yvonne!'    Yvonne certainly managed her affairs better. Fate saved her from the  misfortune of falling in love too soon. She always had a train of  admirers, and was enabled to enjoy the power of her womanhood to the  full; she travelled, made delightful friendships with both sexes, learnt  to know the world and acquired a philosophy of life. When she married,  at twenty-nine, she had seen enough of other men to know exactly the  kind of husband she wanted, and had had enough excitement to make her  appreciate the peace and calm of matrimony.    The secrets of many wives lie heavily on my soul as I write, and more  than one woman, with some real reason for remorse, has confided in me  that it was only that fatal desire for excitement that primarily caused  her undoing. I shall instruct my son to be sure to marry a woman who has  got her wild oats safely over, or select a wife of the more  old-fashioned type who does not require them. With the modern  temperament they must almost inevitably come sooner or later, and to  what extent the modern temperament will have evolved by the time the Boy  of Boys is marriageable, the ironical gods alone know!    Bachelors take note! A woman--new style--who has knocked about over half  the world and sown a mild crop of the delectable cereal will prove a far  better wife, a more cheery friend and faithful comrade than the girl _of  more or less the same type_ whose first experience you are, and who will  make enormous claims on your love and patience by reason of her utter  ignorance of men. You will possibly even have to live up to an ideal  founded on novel-reading, and that you will find very wearing, my  friend! The experienced woman knows men so thoroughly, she will expect  nothing more of you than you can give her, and will appreciate your  virtues to the utmost and make the best of your vices. 'But she has  flirted so outrageously,' you say? Well, so much the better, she is less  likely to do it after marriage. 'But, hang it all, she has been kissed  by other men,' you say? Well then, she has no need for further  experiences of this kind and is not likely ever to give her lips again  to others once she is yours. . . . How can you be sure? That is one of  the innumerable risks of marriage. How can _she_ be sure that _your_  last crop is sown, still less reaped? . . . Oh, my dear man, you really  make me very angry--do for heaven's sake try and get away from  conventional ideas of right and wrong! Judge things _for yourself_, and  as they would seem, say, at the edge of an active volcano! . . . All the  things we fuss so much about would doubtless quickly assume their real  value if viewed from this perilous situation.    And even in the sad cases where a woman has sown real wild oats in the  man's sense of the word, how different the little moral rules and  regulations which we keep for these occasions would appear in the face  of an immediate and violent death. I heard not long ago of a very sad  story which bears this out. A man very narrowly escaped death from  drowning, shortly after he had broken his engagement with a girl he  genuinely loved, on her confessing to him that, many years before, she  had once yielded to the importunities of a passionate lover. I do not  know what were his emotions in the awful moment when the waters closed  over him, and he was experiencing that horrible fight for breath which  those who have known it describe as the most terrible sensation  conceivable. Apparently his hairbreadth escape from death tore from his  eyes the swathings of conventional opinion with which he had been  blinded. Instead of regarding himself as a deeply wronged man he  realised that he had behaved horribly to the unfortunate girl, who had  thus been doubly outraged by his sex. He sought her at once and begged  to be taken back again, but she happened to be a woman of some spirit,  and she refused to trust herself to a man of such narrow views, and  given to such harsh judgment.    Of course this treatment increased his love a thousandfold. It obsessed  him to a painful degree, and in the end his desperate entreaties  prevailed on her deep affection for him and she relented. Their marriage  was not very happy, as may be imagined; they both loved to madness and  the ghost of that dead passion stood ever between them, an invisible,  poisonous presence that killed their joy in each other. After a time a  deep melancholy settled on the woman, and she allowed some trifling  illness to take such a hold on her that it caused her death.    When she was dying, I am told, she said to her faithful friend: 'If ever  you meet another woman who has made one little slip--a thing which at  the time seemed so natural and inevitable as not to be sin at all--tell  her never _never_ to confess it to the man she is going to marry, least  of all if she loves him. If that confession doesn't part them  altogether, it will always be between them. One does it wishing to be  straight, but it's the most dreadful mistake a woman can make.'    Her wish to be straight had cost this poor woman not only her whole  life's happiness, and her very life itself, but the happiness of the man  she loved, in whose interests she had made the confession that wrought  the harm. 'How dearly I have paid! how dearly I have paid!' she used to  say over and over again in her last illness.    This is an absolutely true story, and it seems to me a burning injustice  that a woman should suffer so bitterly for what would be absolutely  disregarded in a man. I have no doubt there are many similar cases, and  emphatically I say that such confessions are ill-advised. The ordinary  conventional-thinking man placed in these circumstances would either  throw a woman over, or marry her against his convictions. The  extraordinary masculine code, for some reason beyond my feminine powers  of comprehension, will"]]]
