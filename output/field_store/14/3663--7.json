[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32023"],[0,"The Boy's Voice (#11)"],[1,"    A correspondent from another agricultural county--I will not give his  name--favours me with some rules which he has used more or less for  thirty years. In one school taught by the writer, the inspector said he  could not distinguish the boys from the girls' voices--truly a high  compliment. My correspondent names a new hindrance to church music in  rural places, namely, the clergyman's daughter!--    \"Practise the scales up and down to the words 'la' and 'ha,' the latter  for the purpose of separating the teeth. Commence at the key of C to  C1, then from D to D1, and so on upwards as high as the voices of the  boys can reach, never resting satisfied until they cover two octaves  firmly. In teaching new music, and, generally speaking, in accompanying  the boys, play the note they are singing and its octave above--on the  stopped diapason and flute if an organ, or the corresponding stops on a  harmonium. Let there be no other accompaniment, and on every occasion  the octave above the note sung. This is very particular. Check one voice  singing above another. Have no leaders. Stop or subdue all harsh voices,  and make them listen to, and try to copy the pure notes of the flute;  let the boys sing well within their strength. If you lack power,  increase the number of choristers, and subdue the voices. I always  choose smooth flowing chants, with the reciting note ranging from F to  C. I do not care to go higher than G above the line in anthems or  services, but have trained them to start on B[b], 'The Sisters of the  Sea,' by Jackson.    \"I never trouble about altos, they are too difficult to get, and  indifferent and troublesome when obtained, but in verse parts of  services or anthems, one of the best boys will supply the deficiency,  and even take up the lead in a chorus.    \"Choirs experience a difficulty which is not included in your list of  points. I have received L60 per annum as an organist, L50 and a house.  On another occasion I was offered the choir-mastership of a church  choral society of 60 members. At this time I was trainer and conductor  of a choral society of 100 voices with string and wind accompaniment,  the subject being _The Messiah_. Yet I was not considered competent at  the church at which I played to put a tune to a hymn, but had to submit  to the parson's daughter, who was qualified through taking three months'  lessons from a German. On one occasion this lady went ten times through  a hymn to please her father in trying to fit a four-lined tune of the  wrong metre to a six-lined hymn! I offered to go through an eleventh  time, but he never interfered again. I could give you many instances  where these ladies themselves are the great drawback of good church  singing, but on the other hand, I could mention cases where they never  come near a practice, or interfere from one year's end to the other.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Knowing, as I do, the devoted way in which clergymen's daughters in many  rural places train the choir, I hesitate to endorse this charge. The  work needs to be done with tact and consideration. In the vast majority  of cases these ladies are a great help. I do not approve the plan of  playing the melody in octaves while it is being learnt, which my  correspondent advocates. I give his letter as a record of earnest work.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. W. W. Pearson, of Elmham, Dereham, Norfolk, writes to me as  follows:--    \"I have had, as you say, a great deal of experience in teaching singing,  especially in rural districts; but the neighbourhood I have lived in for  the last twenty years (Norfolk), is a very barren field for musical  culture--the worst in my experience. The voices of those who _do_ sing  in this county are, on an average, a minor third lower than those of  Yorkshire, North Wales, the west of England, and other places where I  have had experience. They are also, for the most part, _flabby_, wanting  in resonance and quality. Tenors are very scarce, and even the few who  can sing in the tenor register, have not got the true tenor quality.  This may be the effect of the low elevation above the sea-level, and  the damp humid atmosphere; or it may be partly due to _race_.    \"The plan I adopt for getting boys to use their upper registers is a  very old-fashioned one; but it is very effective. It is to make them  sing the major diatonic scale, ascending and descending; beginning at a  low pitch, and gradually raising it by a semitone at a time.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. C. Hibberd, of Bemerton, near Salisbury, whom I quote also in the  chapter on \"Flattening,\" dwells on the difficulties of the rural  choirmaster. He says:--    \"I have rarely come across the soft fluty tone in the country. I once  met with a boy with it in the choir at Parkstone, near Bournemouth, and  another here at Bemerton, but in both cases the boys were above the  average of country boys, and the village was close to a larger town. In  both cases, also, the boys had good and careful practice over and above  the ordinary choir practices. At places farther in the country it seems  an impossibility to get the tone. With only a few boys to pick from, it  is a difficulty to find boys enough to fill up ordinary vacancies. With  a great deal of trouble and practice one can get a great part of the  roughness toned down, and, as a rule, that is all.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Several of my correspondents, it will be noticed, speak with great  confidence of the use of the Tonic Sol-fa system in rural places. This  system, useful everywhere, certainly attains its greatest usefulness in  places where the task of the choirmaster reaches its highest degree of  difficulty. To those whose only acquaintance with Tonic Sol-fa is a  casual glance at a printed page of the new notation, it naturally seems  strange that the use of a musical shorthand can affect the whole  training of the boy. But behind the letters and punctuation marks, which  go to make up the Tonic Sol-fa notation, there lies the Tonic Sol-fa  method--a fixed and many-sided educational system, founded on the truest  principles of education, carrying on simultaneously the training of the  ear for tune and time, making progress sure because gradually  developing the intelligence along with the voice. With Tonic Sol-fa,  also, is associated a definite system of voice-training. Tonic Sol-fa  teachers are all more or less of educationists, and have caught by  observation or study the teacher's art. This is the cause of their  success.    [Illustration: Decoration]          CHAPTER XI.    NOTES ON THE PRACTICE OF VARIOUS CHOIRMASTERS IN CATHEDRALS, &c.      I SUMMARISE here information obtained, chiefly by observation and  conversation, from various trainers of boys' voices at cathedrals and  collegiate churches.      CHAPEL ROYAL, ST. JAMES'S.    Some years ago I attended a practice of the boys, under the late Rev.  Thomas Helmore. It began with slow scales sung to a light pianoforte  accompaniment. These were followed by rapid runs, the key gradually  rising until the highest note touched was C above the treble staff. The  vocable used was \"ah.\" After this came time exercises, solfeggios, the  pointing out of notes by the boys on and between the fingers of their  left hands, which represented the staff. Mr. Helmore declared that new  boys while singing nearly always (1) frown, or (2) hold their heads on  one side. He was strict about avoiding these faults. In going over the  psalms for the day, the boys sang mostly one by one, verse after verse.  This was a searching test for the boy who sang, while all the others  were actively criticising. The boys practised secular music by way of  change. Four of them were monitors, four fags, and two probationers. The  tone was refined and pure, Mr. Helmore himself being a good singer.      ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.    Here, owing to the size of the building, a tremendous volume of shrill  tone has to be cultivated, which in the practice room is sometimes  overwhelming. The practice I heard began with slow scales sung to \"ah\"  (pianoforte accompaniment) ranging over two octaves, C to C2; each key  between C to C1 was taken, and the scale sung ascending and descending.  This was loud singing, but not shouting. Then came agility exercises in  the form of chords, rapid scales, &c., sung still to \"ah.\" This daily  \"tuning-up\" lasted ten minutes. Then (incidentally affording rest to the  boys) came a short lesson on theory. Boys were called up in turn to  write notes, signs, &c., on the blackboard. Practice now began. The boys  sing a new piece to words at once, never sol-faing. They seldom try a  piece more than three times before it is heard at the cathedral. They  sit during rehearsal, standing at the Gloria Patri. The boys have a  daily practice of an hour-and-a-half.      WESTMINSTER ABBEY.    The refined style of the boys trained by Dr. Bridge is well known. The  abbey is small enough to allow the graces of singing to be cultivated.  In the music room there are two rows of desks facing the same way, so  that Dr. Bridge, sitting at his cottage piano, can cast a side glance  full upon the boys. Two practices are held daily; one from nine till ten  a.m. is spent in getting up the service music. The afternoon practice,  at the close of evensong, is chiefly devoted to theory. A card hanging  up on the wall shows exactly how the time of the afternoon practice is  apportioned between the study of intervals, and scales, chanting,  responses, manuscript exercises, the singing of Concone's solfeggios,  and the practice of secular music. The excellent phrasing and pure tone  are partly due to the practice of secular music, which gives elasticity  and gentleness to the boys' voices. No formal system of voice-training  is in use. The boys enter at from 9 to 10-1/2, not older. A new boy is  placed in the middle of the row "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#11)"],[1," it up in a packing case.  This was in  the year 1521, on the Saturday before Judicz.    Also on the Saturday before Judicz, Rodrigo gave me six  large Indian cocoanuts, a very fine piece of coral, and two  large Portuguese florins, one of which weighs 10 ducats, and  I gave the boy 15 stivers for a tip. I have bought a lode-  stone for 16 stivers. I have changed an angel for expenses.  Paid 6 stivers for packing. Sent Master Hugo at Brussels an  engraved \"Passion\" and some other prints for his little  porphyry stone. I have made for Tomasin a design drawn and  tinted in half-colours, from which he means to have his  house painted. I painted \"Jerome\" in oils with care and gave  it to Rodrigo of Portugal, who gave Susanna a ducat for a  tip. Have changed a Philip's florin for expenses and gave 10  stivers to my Father Confessor. Gave 4 stivers for the  little tortoise. I have dined with Herr Gilbert, who gave me  a Calicut target made of a fish skin, and two gloves as they  use them for fighting. I have given Peter 2 stivers. Gave 10  stivers for the fish fins, and 3 stivers for a tip. I have  made a very good portrait in hard chalk of Cornelius, the  secretary of Antwerp.    I have given 3 florins, 16 stivers, for the five silk  girdles which I mean to give away, besides 20 stivers for an  edging [lace?]. These six edgings I have sent as presents to  the wives of Kasperi Nutzel, Franz Imhof, Straub, the two  Spenglers, Loffelholz, besides a good pair of gloves to  each. To Pirkheimer I have sent a large cap, a very handsome  buffalo horn inkstand, a silver [medal of the] Emperor, a  pound of pistachios, and three sugar canes. To Kasper  Ntitzel I have sent a great elk's foot, ten large fir cones  with pine kernels. To Jacob Muffel I have sent a scarlet  breast cloth of one ell; to Hans Imhof's child an  embroidered scarlet cap and pine kernels; to Kramer's wife  four ells of taffeta, worth 4 florins. To Lochinger's wife  one ell of taffeta, of 1 florin's worth; to the two  Spenglers, each a bag and three fine horns; to Herr  Hieronimus Holzschuher, a very large horn.    Have eaten twice with the factor; dined with Master Adrian,  the secretary of the town council of Antwerp, who gave me  the small painted panel made by Master Joachim [de Patinir]:  it is of \"Lot and his Daughters.\" Have taken 12 florins for  prints, also I have sold some of Hans Baldung Grun's works  for 1 florin. Rudiger von Gelern has given me a piece of  sandalwood; I gave his boy a stiver. I have painted the  portrait of Bernhard of Brussels in oils; he gave me 8  florins for it, and gave my wife a crown, and Susanna a  florin worth 24 stivers. I have given 3 stivers for the  Swiss jug, and 2 stivers for the ship, also 3 stivers for  the case and 4 stivers to the Father Confessor. I have  changed an angel for expenses; have taken 4 florins, 10  stivers for works of art: paid 3 stivers for salve; gave 12  1/2 stivers for wood; changed 1 florin for expenses; have  given 1 florin for 14 pieces of French wood. I gave Ambrozio  Hochstutter a \"Life of Our Lady,\" and he gave me a model of  his ship. Rodrigo gave my wife a little ring which is worth  more than 5 florins. Have changed 1 florin for expenses.    I have done the portrait of Factor Brandon's secretary in  charcoal; I have done the portrait of his Moorish woman in  silverpoint, and I have done Rodrigo's portrait on a large  sheet of paper with the brush, in black and white. I have  given 16 florins for a piece of camlet measuring twenty-four  ells, and it cost 1 stiver to bring home. Have paid 2  stivers for gloves. I have done Lucas of Dantzic's portrait  in charcoal. He gave me 1 florin for it, and a piece of  sandalwood.      VISIT TO BRUGES AND GHENT (April 6-11, 1521)    On the Saturday after Easter, with Hans Luber and Master Jan  Prevost, a good painter born at Bruges, I set out from  Antwerp towards Bruges by way of the Scheldt and came to  Beveren, a large village. From there to Vracene, also a big  village; thence we passed through some villages and came to  a fine large village, where the rich farmers live, and there  we breakfasted. Thence we journeyed towards St. Paul's, the  rich abbey, and went through Caudenborn, a fine village;  thence through the large village of Kalve, and thence to  Ertvelde; there we lay the night and started early on Sunday  morning and came from Ertvelde to a small town. From that we  went to Ecloo, which is a mighty large village; it is  plastered, and has a square; there we breakfasted. Thence we  went to Maldegem, and then through other villages, and came  to Bruges--which is a fine noble town. I paid 21 stivers for  fare and other expenses. And arriving at Bruges, Jan Prevost  took me into his house to lodge, and the same night prepared  a costly meal, and asked much company to meet me.    The next day Marx, the goldsmith, invited me, and gave me a  costly meal and asked many to meet me; afterwards they took  me to see the Emperor's house, which is large and splendid.  There I saw the chapel which Roger painted, and some  pictures by a great old artist. I gave the man who showed  them to us 1 stiver; afterwards I bought two ivory combs for  30 stivers. Thence they took me to St. James's and let me  see the splendid paintings of Roger and Hugo, who are both  great masters. Afterwards I saw the alabaster Madonna in Our  Lady's Church that Michelangelo of Rome made; afterwards  they took me to many churches and let me see all the fine  paintings, of which there is abundance there, and when I had  seen the Jan [Van Eyck] and all the other things, we came at  last to the Painters' Chapel, in which there are good  things. Then they prepared a banquet for me, and I went  thence with them to their guildhall; there were many  honourable men gathered together, goldsmiths, painters, and  merchants, and they made me sup with them, and they gave me  presents and sought my acquaintance and did me great honour;  and the two brothers Jacob and Peter Mostaert, the town  councilors, gave me twelve cans of wine, and the whole  assembly, more than sixty persons, accompanied me home with  many torches. I also saw in their shooting gallery the great  fish tub from which they eat, which is 19 feet long, 7 high,  and 7 broad.    Early on Tuesday we departed, but before that, I did Jan  Prevost's portrait in silverpoint, and gave his wife 10  stivers at parting. And so we traveled to Ursel; there we  breakfasted. On the way there are three villages. Then we  traveled towards Ghent, again through three villages, and I  paid 4 stivers for the journey, and 4 stivers for expenses;  and on my arrival at Ghent, there came to me the dean of the  painters and brought with him the first masters in painting;  they showed me great honour, received me most courteously,  and commended to me their good-will and service, and supped  with me. On Wednesday early they took me to the tower of St.  John's, whence I looked all over the great and wonderful  town, where I had just been treated as a great person.  Afterwards I saw the Jan [Van Eyck's] picture, which is a  very splendid, deeply studied painting, and especially the  \"Eve,\" the \"Mary,\" and \"God the Father\" were extremely good.    Then I saw the lions and drew one of them in silverpoint;  also I saw on the bridge, where men are beheaded, two  pictures which were made as a sign that there a son had  beheaded his father. Ghent is beautiful and a wonderful  town; four great waters flow through it. I gave 3 stivers as  a tip to the sacristan and the lions' keeper. I saw many  other remarkable things in Ghent, and the painters with  their dean did not forget me, but ate with me morning and  evening, and paid for everything, and were very friendly. I  gave away 3 stivers at the inn on leaving. Then early on  Thursday I set out from Ghent and came through various  villages to the inn called \"The Swan,\" where we breakfasted;  thence we passed through a beautiful village and came to  Antwerp, and I paid 8 stivers for the fare.      AT ANTWERP (April 11-May 17, 1521)    I have taken 4 florins for works of art; changed one florin  for expenses. Have taken the portrait of Hans Lieber of Ulm  in charcoal; he wished to pay me 1 florin, but I would not  take it. Gave 7 stivers for wood and 1 stiver for bringing  it; changed 1 florin for expenses. In the third week after  Easter a violent fever came upon me with great weakness,  nausea, and headache; and before, when I was in Zeeland, a  strange illness overcame me such as I never heard of from  anyone, and this illness I have still. I paid 6 stivers for  a case. The monk has bound two books for me for the prints  which I gave him. I have given 10 florins, 8 stivers for a  piece of arras for two mantles for my mother-in-law and my  wife. I gave the doctor 8 stivers, and 3 stivers to the  apothecary, also changed 1 florin for expenses and spent 3  stivers in company. Paid the doctor 10 stivers; again paid  the doctor 6 stivers.    During my illness Rodrigo sent me many sweetmeats; I gave  the boy 4 stivers for a tip. I have drawn Master Joachim  [Patinir] in silverpoint, and made him besides another  likeness in silverpoint. Again changed a crown for expenses,  and again 1 florin for expenses. Paid the doctor 6 stivers,  and 7 stivers at the apothecary's; changed 1 florin for  expenses. For packing the third bale, which I sent from  Antwerp to Nuremberg by a carrier called Hans Staber, I paid  13 stivers, and I paid the carrier 1 florin for it, and I  agreed with him to take it from Antwerp to Nuremberg for 1  florin, I ort, per cwt., and this bale is to be taken to  Herr Hans Imhof, the elder. I have paid the doctor, the  apothecary, and the barber 14 stivers. I gave Master Jacob,  the surgeon, 4 florins' worth of prints. I have made a  portrait in charcoal of Thomas Polonius of Rome.    My camlet cloak came to twenty-one Brabant ells, which are  three finger-breadths longer than the"]]]
