By now Herzl would have been pleased to  let the East African project disappear from the agenda; it was clear  that the English government was not greatly interested and was seeking  a way out; but the devious route of political action, once started,  could not so easily be halted; Herzl found himself chained to a  political reality.    Throughout his Zionist life, Herzl suffered from a heart ailment  which became more and more acute as he was taken up by the excitements  and activities of the Movement. He became aware of his illness soon  after he had written \"The Jewish State.\" He had premonitions of the  fatal consequences but persisted in carrying the burden of the  Movement himself, consuming all his strength in the process. At  intervals he was forced to take rest cures. On a number of occasions  it was thought that he had reached the end of his strength. When he  was grappling with the Uganda project, York-Steiner, an intimate  friend, wrote of his appearance: \"The imposing figure is now stooped,  the face sallow, the eyes--the mirrors of a fine soul--were darkened,  the mouth was drawn in pain and marked by passion.\"    He was almost at the brink of the grave. In May, an alarming change  for the worse occurred in the condition of his heart muscles. He was  ordered to Franzienbad for six weeks, but the rest did him no good. On  June 3, he left with his wife and several friends for Edlach in  Semmering. He knew that this was his last journey. Then there was a  slight improvement and he returned to his desk. But he rapidly grew  worse. To the faithful Hechler he said, \"Give them all my greetings  and tell them that I have given my heart's blood for my people.\" On  July 3, pneumonia set in and there were signs of approaching  exhaustion. His mother arrived, then his two younger children, Hans  and Trude. At five in the afternoon, his physician who had taken his  eyes off the patient for a moment, heard a deep sigh. When he turned,  he saw Herzl's head sunk on his breast.    In his will Herzl asked that his body be buried next to his father,  \"to remain there until the Jewish people will carry my remains to  Palestine.\" When the Russians entered Vienna in 1945 the remains of  Herzl were still there.          _The Jewish State_    by    _Theodor Herzl_          _Preface_      The idea which I have developed in this pamphlet is a very old one: it  is the restoration of the Jewish State.    The world resounds with outcries against the Jews, and these outcries  have awakened the slumbering idea.    I wish it to be clearly understood from the outset that no portion of  my argument is based on a new discovery. I have discovered neither the  historic condition of the Jews nor the means to improve it. In fact,  every man will see for himself that the materials of the structure I  am designing are not only in existence, but actually already in hand.  If, therefore, this attempt to solve the Jewish Question is to be  designated by a single word, let it be said to be the result of an  inescapable conclusion rather than that of a flighty imagination.    I must, in the first place, guard my scheme from being treated as  Utopian by superficial critics who might commit this error of judgment  if I did not warn them. I should obviously have done nothing to be  ashamed of if I had described a Utopia on philanthropic lines; and I  should also, in all probability, have obtained literary success more  easily if I had set forth my plan in the irresponsible guise of a  romantic tale. But this Utopia is far less attractive than any one of  those portrayed by Sir Thomas More and his numerous forerunners and  successors. And I believe that the situation of the Jews in many  countries is grave enough to make such preliminary trifling  superfluous.    An interesting book, \"Freiland,\" by Dr. Theodor Hertzka, which  appeared a few years ago, may serve to mark the distinction I draw  between my conception and a Utopia. His is the ingenious invention of  a modern mind thoroughly schooled in the principles of political  economy, it is as remote from actuality as the Equatorial mountain on  which his dream State lies. \"Freiland\" is a complicated piece of  mechanism with numerous cogged wheels fitting into each other; but  there is nothing to prove that they can be set in motion. Even  supposing \"Freiland societies\" were to come into existence, I should  look on the whole thing as a joke.    The present scheme, on the other hand, includes the employment of an  existent propelling force. In consideration of my own inadequacy, I  shall content myself with indicating the cogs and wheels of the  machine to be constructed, and I shall rely on more skilled  mechanicians than myself to put them together.    Everything depends on our propelling force. And what is that force?  The misery of the Jews.    Who would venture to deny its existence? We shall discuss it fully in  the chapter on the causes of Anti-Semitism.    Everybody is familiar with the phenomenon of steam-power, generated by  boiling water, which lifts the kettle-lid. Such tea-kettle phenomena  are the attempts of Zionist and kindred associations to check  Anti-Semitism.    I believe that this power, if rightly employed, is powerful enough to  propel a large engine and to move passengers and goods: the engine  having whatever form men may choose to give it.    I am absolutely convinced that I am right, though I doubt whether I  shall live to see myself proved to be so. Those who are the first to  inaugurate this movement will scarcely live to see its glorious close.  But the inauguration of it is enough to give them a feeling of pride  and the joy of spiritual freedom.    I shall not be lavish in artistically elaborated descriptions of my  project, for fear of incurring the suspicion of painting a Utopia. I  anticipate, in any case, that thoughtless scoffers will caricature my  sketch and thus try to weaken its effect. A Jew, intelligent in other  respects, to whom I explained my plan, was of the opinion that \"a  Utopia was a project whose future details were represented as already  extant.\" This is a fallacy. Every Chancellor of the Exchequer  calculates in his Budget estimates with assumed figures, and not only  with such as are based on the average returns of past years, or on  previous revenues in other States, but sometimes with figures for  which there is no precedent whatever; as for example, in instituting a  new tax. Everybody who studies a Budget knows that this is the case.  But even if it were known that the estimates would not be rigidly  adhered to, would such a financial draft be considered Utopian?    But I am expecting more of my readers. I ask the cultivated men whom I  am addressing to set many preconceived ideas entirely aside. I shall  even go so far as to ask those Jews who have most earnestly tried to  solve the Jewish Question to look upon their previous attempts as  mistaken and futile.    I must guard against a danger in setting forth my idea. If I describe  future circumstances with too much caution I shall appear to doubt  their possibility. If, on the other hand, I announce their realization  with too much assurance I shall appear to be describing a chimera.    I shall therefore clearly and emphatically state that I believe in the  practical outcome of my scheme, though without professing to have  discovered the shape it may ultimately take. The Jewish State is  essential to the world; it will therefore be created.    The plan would, of course, seem absurd if a single individual  attempted to do it; but if worked by a number of Jews in co-operation  it would appear perfectly rational, and its accomplishment would  present no difficulties worth mentioning. The idea depends only on the  number of its supporters. Perhaps our ambitious young men, to whom  every road of progress is now closed, seeing in this Jewish State a  bright prospect of freedom, happiness and honors opening to them, will  ensure the propagation of the idea.    I feel that with the publication of this pamphlet my task is done. I  shall not again take up the pen, unless the attacks of noteworthy  antagonists drive me to do so, or it becomes necessary to meet  unforeseen objections and to remove errors.    Am I stating what is not yet the case? Am I before my time? Are the  sufferings of the Jews not yet grave enough? We shall see.    It depends on the Jews themselves whether this political pamphlet  remains for the present a political romance. If the present generation  is too dull to understand it rightly, a future, finer and a better  generation will arise to understand it. The Jews who wish for a State  shall have it, and they will deserve to have it.          _Chapter I. Introduction_      It is astonishing how little insight into the science of economics  many of the men who move in the midst of active life possess. Hence it  is that even Jews faithfully repeat the cry of the Anti-Semites: \"We  depend for sustenance on the nations who are our hosts, and if we had  no hosts to support us we should die of starvation.\" This is a point  that shows how unjust accusations may weaken our self-knowledge. But  what are the true grounds for this statement concerning the nations  that act as \"hosts\"? Where it is not based on limited physiocratic  views it is founded on the childish error that commodities pass from  hand to hand in continuous rotation. We need not wake from long  slumber, like Rip van Winkle, to realize that the world is  considerably altered by the production of new commodities. The  technical progress made during this wonderful era enables even a man  of most limited intelligence to note with his short-sighted eyes the  appearance of new commodities all around him. The spirit of enterprise  has created them.    Labor without enterprise is the stationary labor of ancient days; and  typical of it is the work of the husbandman, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#11)"],[1,"this view  affords a satisfactory account of animal desires, it is not difficult  to see that the same explanation is applicable to the desires of human  beings.    We judge easily from the behaviour of an animal of a familiar  kind whether it is hungry or thirsty, or pleased or displeased, or  inquisitive or terrified. The verification of our judgment, so far  as verification is possible, must be derived from the immediately  succeeding actions of the animal. Most people would say that they infer  first something about the animal's state of mind--whether it is hungry  or thirsty and so on--and thence derive their expectations as to its  subsequent conduct. But this detour through the animal's supposed mind  is wholly unnecessary. We can say simply: The animal's behaviour during  the last minute has had those characteristics which distinguish what  is called \"hunger,\" and it is likely that its actions during the next  minute will be similar in this respect, unless it finds food, or is  interrupted by a stronger impulse, such as fear. An animal which is  hungry is restless, it goes to the places where food is often to be  found, it sniffs with its nose or peers with its eyes or otherwise  increases the sensitiveness of its sense-organs; as soon as it is near  enough to food for its sense-organs to be affected, it goes to it with  all speed and proceeds to eat; after which, if the quantity of food has  been sufficient, its whole demeanour changes it may very likely lie  down and go to sleep. These things and others like them are observable  phenomena distinguishing a hungry animal from one which is not hungry.  The characteristic mark by which we recognize a series of actions  which display hunger is not the animal's mental state, which we cannot  observe, but something in its bodily behaviour; it is this observable  trait in the bodily behaviour that I am proposing to call \"hunger,\"  not some possibly mythical and certainly unknowable ingredient of the  animal's mind.    Generalizing what occurs in the case of hunger, we may say that what  we call a desire in an animal is always displayed in a cycle of actions  having certain fairly well marked characteristics. There is first a  state of activity, consisting, with qualifications to be mentioned  presently, of movements likely to have a certain result; these  movements, unless interrupted, continue until the result is achieved,  after which there is usually a period of comparative quiescence. A cycle  of actions of this sort has marks by which it is broadly distinguished  from the motions of dead matter. The most notable of these marks  are--(1) the appropriateness of the actions for the realization of a  certain result; (2) the continuance of action until that result has been  achieved. Neither of these can be pressed beyond a point. Either may  be (a) to some extent present in dead matter, and (b) to a considerable  extent absent in animals, while vegetable are intermediate, and display  only a much fainter form of the behaviour which leads us to attribute  desire to animals. (a) One might say rivers \"desire\" the sea water,  roughly speaking, remains in restless motion until it reaches either  the sea or a place from which it cannot issue without going uphill, and  therefore we might say that this is what it wishes while it is flowing.  We do not say so, because we can account for the behaviour of water by  the laws of physics; and if we knew more about animals, we might equally  cease to attribute desires to them, since we might find physical and  chemical reactions sufficient to account for their behaviour. (b) Many  of the movements of animals do not exhibit the characteristics of the  cycles which seem to embody desire. There are first of all the movements  which are \"mechanical,\" such as slipping and falling, where ordinary  physical forces operate upon the animal's body almost as if it were  dead matter. An animal which falls over a cliff may make a number of  desperate struggles while it is in the air, but its centre of gravity  will move exactly as it would if the animal were dead. In this case, if  the animal is killed at the end of the fall, we have, at first sight,  just the characteristics of a cycle of actions embodying desire, namely,  restless movement until the ground is reached, and then quiescence.  Nevertheless, we feel no temptation to say that the animal desired what  occurred, partly because of the obviously mechanical nature of the whole  occurrence, partly because, when an animal survives a fall, it tends not  to repeat the experience.    There may be other reasons also, but of them I do not wish to speak yet.  Besides mechanical movements, there are interrupted movements, as when  a bird, on its way to eat your best peas, is frightened away by the boy  whom you are employing for that purpose. If interruptions are frequent  and completion of cycles rare, the characteristics by which cycles  are observed may become so blurred as to be almost unrecognizable. The  result of these various considerations is that the differences  between animals and dead matter, when we confine ourselves to external  unscientific observation of integral behaviour, are a matter of degree  and not very precise. It is for this reason that it has always been  possible for fanciful people to maintain that even stocks and stones  have some vague kind of soul. The evidence that animals have souls is  so very shaky that, if it is assumed to be conclusive, one might just as  well go a step further and extend the argument by analogy to all matter.  Nevertheless, in spite of vagueness and doubtful cases, the existence  of cycles in the behaviour of animals is a broad characteristic by which  they are prima facie distinguished from ordinary matter; and I think it  is this characteristic which leads us to attribute desires to animals,  since it makes their behaviour resemble what we do when (as we say) we  are acting from desire.    I shall adopt the following definitions for describing the behaviour of  animals:    A \"behaviour-cycle\" is a series of voluntary or reflex movements of an  animal, tending to cause a certain result, and continuing until that  result is caused, unless they are interrupted by death, accident,  or some new behaviour-cycle. (Here \"accident\" may be defined as the  intervention of purely physical laws causing mechanical movements.)    The \"purpose\" of a behaviour-cycle is the result which brings it to an  end, normally by a condition of temporary quiescence-provided there is  no interruption.    An animal is said to \"desire\" the purpose of a behaviour cycle while the  behaviour-cycle is in progress.    I believe these definitions to be adequate also to human purposes and  desires, but for the present I am only occupied with animals and with  what can be learnt by external observation. I am very anxious that no  ideas should be attached to the words \"purpose\" and \"desire\" beyond  those involved in the above definitions.    We have not so far considered what is the nature of the initial stimulus  to a behaviour-cycle. Yet it is here that the usual view of desire seems  on the strongest ground. The hungry animal goes on making movements  until it gets food; it seems natural, therefore, to suppose that the  idea of food is present throughout the process, and that the thought of  the end to be achieved sets the whole process in motion. Such a view,  however, is obviously untenable in many cases, especially where instinct  is concerned. Take, for example, reproduction and the rearing of the  young. Birds mate, build a nest, lay eggs in it, sit on the eggs, feed  the young birds, and care for them until they are fully grown. It  is totally impossible to suppose that this series of actions, which  constitutes one behaviour-cycle, is inspired by any prevision of the  end, at any rate the first time it is performed.* We must suppose that  the stimulus to the performance of each act is an impulsion from behind,  not an attraction from the future. The bird does what it does, at each  stage, because it has an impulse to that particular action, not because  it perceives that the whole cycle of actions will contribute to the  preservation of the species. The same considerations apply to other  instincts. A hungry animal feels restless, and is led by instinctive  impulses to perform the movements which give it nourishment; but the act  of seeking food is not sufficient evidence from which to conclude that  the animal has the thought of food in its \"mind.\"         * For evidence as to birds' nests, cf. Semon, \"Die Mneme,\"       pp. 209, 210.    Coming now to human beings, and to what we know about our own actions,  it seems clear that what, with us, sets a behaviour-cycle in motion is  some sensation of the sort which we call disagreeable. Take the case  of hunger: we have first an uncomfortable feeling inside, producing a  disinclination to sit still, a sensitiveness to savoury smells, and an  attraction towards any food that there may be in our neighbourhood. At  any moment during this process we may become aware that we are hungry,  in the sense of saying to ourselves, \"I am hungry\"; but we may have been  acting with reference to food for some time before this moment. While we  are talking or reading, we may eat in complete unconsciousness; but we  perform the actions of eating just as we should if we were conscious,  and they cease when our hunger is appeased. What we call \"consciousness\"  seems to be a mere spectator of the process; even when it issues orders,  they are usually, like those of a wise parent, just such as would have  been obeyed even if they had not been given. This view may seem at first  exaggerated, but the more our so-called volitions and their causes are  examined, the more it is forced upon us. The part played by words in all  this is complicated, and a potent source of confusions; I shall return  to it later. For the present, I am"]]]
