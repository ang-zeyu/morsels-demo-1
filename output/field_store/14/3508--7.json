Engineering as a profession is scientific,  idealistic, constructive, profitable. It is combative--in the sense  that it shapes nature's forces--and it calls for a sense of artistry in  its practitioners. Added to these, it embraces a certain kind of  profound knowledge the possession of which is always a source of pride  to the owner.    Let me explain this last. The engineer, being as he is a man who views  things objectively, notes details in everything that comes under his  eye, be it dwelling or automobile, or bookbinding or highway. The layman  does not. The layman, outside his work, sees only the thing itself, when  looking at it--the general outline. But the engineer, trained to note  details in construction, observes detail at a glance, and does it almost  subconsciously, if not immediately after leaving school, then assuredly  later, after he has been practicing his profession for a time. His  outlook is objectively critical. Entering a house for the first time,  and trained as a mechanical engineer, he will note the character of the  woodwork, the decorations, the atmosphere, the arrangement of the  furnishings, all with the same facility that he will note details upon  entering for the first time a power-station or a manufacturing  plant--things within his own province.    Nor is this faculty confined to the concrete. Engineers are of that  deeply instinctive race of folk who perceive cause in effect with the  lightning swiftness of a wild animal. If they are not this when entering  upon the profession, assuredly they become so after a period spent in  the work. Something about the practice of engineering breeds it--breeds  this objective seeing and abstract reasoning--and to be possessed of it  is to get more out of life than otherwise is possible. Which possibly  accounts for the fact that engineers as a group seem to have a  common-sense viewpoint of things, one that is frankly acknowledged and  drawn upon when needed by men in other walks of life. Engineers are  extremely practical-minded, and this makes for a certain outlook that  will not permit of visionary scaring away from the common sense and the  practical on the part of its possessor. Engineers know why things occur  without having witnessed even the occurrence itself. Their powers of  reasoning are developed to degrees beyond the average--or they seem to  be--and out of this comes one of the sources of gratification on the  personal side to the man who pursues engineering as a profession.    The thing spreads out as I contemplate it. I would make so bold as to  say that the man of engineering training will see more at a glance when  first viewing the Grand Canyon, say, than will any other professionally  trained man. Should the Canyon collapse, he would know instantly why it  collapsed. He could give an opinion on the wonderful color effects that  would interest the artist, and he would know without hesitation how best  to descend to the bottom and wherein to seek the easiest trail. All  this, without his being a civil or a mining engineer, understand; merely  a man trained in constructive mechanics. On the other hand, the mining  or the civil man would view the wreckage of a locomotive accident and  see in the debris, select from the snarl of tangled wheels and  driving-arms and axles a ready picture of the nature of the accident and  how much of the wreckage offered possibilities for repair. Again, the  engineer sees in a tree, with its tapering trunk, the symbol of all  tower construction, just as he sees in the shape of a man's arm the  pattern to follow when devising a cast-iron lever for an automatic  machine. He sees things, does the engineer; sees objectively; follows  nature throughout.    All this being true, the engineer has a rather interesting life of it.  For not only does he see a little more clearly than otherwise would be  possible to him without his education and training, but also he does  things with his hands that come easy to him without previously having  undertaken them. The engineer can do much around his own home, if he so  choose, that of itself is a source of great satisfaction. Engineers can  swing doors, build fireplaces, landscape, erect fences, make garden, and  can perform these tasks with a degree of neatness and skill that brings  favorable comment from journeymen whose vocations this work is, and do  the work without training whatsoever in the work. Wall-papering,  painting, carpentering, laying up of brick, or the placing of a dry  wall--plastering, glazing--the list is endless that as side-plays are  possible to the man with an engineering training. He need not do these  things, ever; but if he wants ever to do them, he finds that he can do  them and do a creditable job of each, and this without his ever having  turned his hand to the work before.    Which sums up in a measure the personal side. The engineer is not a  superior being. Merely he is a man possessed of a highly specialized  education and training which peculiarly fits him for any practical work,  and out of this work, for practical thinking of the kind known as  constructive. Being constructive with his hands, he cannot but in time  become constructive with his brain. Being constructive as a thinker  first, he cannot but become constructive as a doer later. The one hinges  closely on the other, and having both, as the engineer must who would be  a successful engineer, he has as much of the world under his control as  comes to any man, and, in a great degree, more than is the favorable lot  of most men. For the engineer is both a thinker and a doer. Ponder  that--you. Men are either one or the other--most men--and rarely are  they both. Either side of their brain has been developed at the expense  of the other side. Not so with the engineer. The successful engineer is  both thinker and doer--must be in his profession. It seems to me that  engineering has many beautiful attractions as a profession."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#11)"],[1,"the secret springs of action. He is aristocratic in his  politics, monarchical, an advocate for the centralisation of power;  but he would have the monarch enlightened, constitutional, and  pacific. He values solid gains more than showy magnificence; and  knowing the use of astuteness, he knows also the importance of good  faith. He has a sense of the balance of European power, and anticipates  Montesquieu in his theory of the influence of climates on peoples.  There is something of pity, something of irony, in the view which  he takes of the joyless lot of the great ones of the earth. Having  ascertained how few of the combinations of events can be controlled  by the wisest calculation, he takes refuge in a faith in Providence;  he finds God necessary to explain this entangled world; and yet his  morality is in great part that which tries good and evil by the test  of success. By the intensity of his thought Commines sometimes becomes  striking in his expression; occasionally he rises to a grave  eloquence; occasionally his irony is touched by a bitter humour. But  in general he writes with little sentiment and no sense of beauty,  under the control of a dry and circumspect intelligence.          CHAPTER IV  LATEST MEDIAEVAL POETS--THE DRAMA      I  LATEST MEDIAEVAL POETS    The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries form a period of transition  from the true Middle Ages to the Renaissance. The national epopee  was dead; the Arthurian tales were rehandled in prose; under the  influence of the _Roman de la Rose_, allegory was highly popular,  and Jean de Meun had shown how it could be applied to the  secularisation of learning; the middle classes were seeking for  instruction. In lyric poetry the free creative spirit had declined,  but the technique of verse was elaborated and reduced to rule; ballade,  chant royal, lai, virelai, rondeau were the established forms, and  lyric verse was often used for matter of a didactic, moral, or  satirical tendency. Even Ovid was tediously moralised (_c_. 1300)  in some seventy thousand lines by Chretien Legouais. Literary  societies or _puys_[1] were instituted, which maintained the rules  of art, and awarded crowns to successful competitors in poetry; a  formal ingenuity replaced lyrical inspiration; poetry accepted  proudly the name of \"rhetoric.\" At the same time there is gain in  one respect--the poets no longer conceal their own personality behind  their work: they instruct, edify, moralise, express their real or  simulated passions in their own persons; if their art is mechanical,  yet through it we make some acquaintance with the men and manners  of the age.    [Footnote 1: _Puy_, mountain, eminence, signifying the elevated seat  of the judges of the artistic competition.]    The chief exponent of the new art of poetry was GUILLAUME DE MACHAUT.  Born about 1300, he served as secretary to the King of Bohemia, who  fell at Crecy. He enjoyed a tranquil old age in his province of  Champagne, cultivating verse and music with the applause of his  contemporaries. The ingenuities of gallantry are deployed at length  in his _Jugement du Roi de Navarre_; he relates with dull prolixity  the history of his patron, Pierre de Lusignan, King of Cyprus, in  his _Prise d'Alexandrie_; the _Voir dit_ relates in varying verse  and prose the course of his sexagenarian love for a maiden in her  teens, Peronne d'Armentieres, who gratified her coquetry with an old  poet's adoration, and then wedded his rival.    In the forms of his verse EUSTACHE DESCHAMPS, also a native of  Champagne (_c_. 1345-1405), was a disciple of Machaut: if he was not  a poet, he at least interests a reader by rhymed journals of his own  life and the life of his time, written in the spirit of an honest  bourgeois, whom disappointed personal hopes and public misfortune  had early embittered. Eighty thousand lines, twelve hundred ballades,  nearly two hundred rondeaux, a vast unfinished satire on woman, the  _Miroir de Mariage_, fatigued even his own age, and the official court  poet of France outlived his fame. He sings of love in the conventional  modes; his historical poems, celebrating events of the day, have  interest by virtue of their matter; as a moralist in verse he deplores  the corruption of high and low, the cupidity in Church and State,  and, above all, applies his wit to expose the vices and infirmities  of women. The earliest Poetic in French--_L'art de dictier et de fere  chancons, balades, virelais, et rondeaulx_ (1392)--is the work of  Eustache Deschamps, in which the poet, by no means himself a master  of harmonies, insists on the prime importance of harmony in verse.    The exhaustion of the mediaeval sources of inspiration is still more  apparent in the fifteenth-century successors of Deschamps. But  already something of the reviving influence of Italian culture makes  itself felt. CHRISTINE DE PISAN, Italian by her parentage and place  of birth (_c_. 1363), was left a widow with three young children at  the age of twenty-five. Her sorrow, uttered in verse, is a genuine  lyric cry; but when in her poverty she practised authorship as a trade,  while she wins our respect as a mother, the poetess is too often at  once facile and pedantic. Christine was zealous in maintaining the  honour of her sex against the injuries of Jean de Meun; in her prose  _Cite des Dames_ she celebrates the virtues and heroism of women,  with examples from ancient and modern times; in the _Livre des Trois  Vertus_ she instructs women in their duties. When advanced in years,  and sheltered in the cloister, she sang her swan-song in honour of  Joan of Arc. Admirable in every relation of life, a patriot and a  scholar, she only needed one thing--genius--to be a poet of  distinction.    A legend relates that the Dauphiness, Margaret of Scotland, kissed  the lips of a sleeper who was the ugliest man in France, because from  that \"precious mouth\" had issued so many \"good words and virtuous  sayings.\" The sleeper was Christine's poetical successor, ALAIN  CHARTIER. His fame was great, and as a writer of prose he must be  remembered with honour, both for his patriotic ardour, and for the  harmonious eloquence (modelled on classical examples) in which that  ardour found expression. His first work, the _Livre des Quatre Dames_,  is in verse: four ladies lament their husbands slain, captured, lost,  or fugitive and dishonoured, at Agincourt. Many of his other poems  were composed as a distraction from the public troubles of the time;  the title of one, widely celebrated in its own day, _La Belle Dame  sans Mercy_, has obtained a new meaning of romance through its  appropriation by Keats. In 1422 he wrote his prose _Quadrilogue  Invectif_, in which suffering France implores the nobles, the clergy,  the people to show some pity for her miserable state. If Froissart  had not discerned the evils of the feudal system, they were patent  to the eyes of Alain Chartier. His _Livre de l'Esperance_, where the  oratorical prose is interspersed with lyric verse, spares neither  the clergy nor the frivolous and dissolute gentry, who forget their  duty to their country in wanton self-indulgence; yet his last word,  written at the moment when Joan of Arc was leaving the pastures for  battle, is one of hope. His _Curial_ (_The Courtier_) is a satire  on the vices of the court by one who had acquaintance with its  corruption. The large, harmonious phrase of Alain Chartier was new  to French prose, and is hardly heard again until the seventeenth  century.    The last grace and refinements of chivalric society blossom in the  poetry of CHARLES D'ORLEANS, \"la grace exquise des choses freles.\"  He was born in 1391, son of Louis, Duke of Orleans, and an Italian  mother, Valentine of Milan. Married at fifteen to the widow of Richard  II. of England, he lost his father by assassination, his mother by  the stroke of grief, his wife in childbirth. From the battlefield  of Agincourt he passed to England, where he remained a prisoner,  closely guarded, for twenty-five years. It seems as if events should  have made him a tragic poet; but for Charles d'Orleans poetry was  the brightness or the consolation of his exile. His elder years at  the little court of Blois were a season of delicate gaiety, when he  enjoyed the recreations of age, and smiled at the passions of youth.  He died in 1465. Neither depth of reflection nor masculine power of  feeling finds expression in his verse; he does not contribute new  ideas to poetry, nor invent new forms, but he rendered the old material  and made the accepted moulds of verse charming by a gracious  personality and an exquisite sense of art. Ballade, rondeau, chanson,  each is manipulated with the skill of a goldsmith setting his gems.  He sings of the beauty of woman, the lighter joys of love, the pleasure  of springtide, the song of the birds, the gliding of a stream or a  cloud; or, as an elder man, he mocks with amiable irony the fatiguing  ardours of young hearts. When St. Valentine's day comes round, his  good physician \"Nonchaloir\" advises him to abstain from choosing a  mistress, and recommends an easy pillow. The influence of Charles  d'Orleans on French poetry was slight; it was not until 1734 that  his forgotten poems were brought to light.    In the close of the mediaeval period, when old things were passing  away and new things were as yet unborn, the minds of men inclined  to fill the void with mockery and satire. Martin Lefranc (_c_. 1410-61)  in his _Champion des Dames_--a poem of twenty-four thousand lines, in  which there is much spirit and vigour of versification--balances one  against another the censure and the praise of women. Coquillard, with  his railleries assuming legal forms and phrases, laughs at love and  lovers, or at the _Droits Nouveaux_ of a happy time when licence had  become the general law. Henri Baude, a realist in his keen observation,  satirises with direct, incisive force, the"]]]
