The  composition of proteine, according to his newest experiments, is--         Carbon       54.0       Hydrogen      7.1       Nitrogen     16.0       Oxygen       21.4       Sulphur       1.5                   -----                   100.0    and is exactly the same from whatever albuminous compound it is  obtained. Although the importance of proteine is probably not so great  as Mulder supposed, it affords an important illustration of the close  similarity of the different substances from which it is obtained, the  more especially as there is every reason to believe that the different  albuminous compounds are capable of changing into one another, just as  starch and sugar are mutually convertible; and the possibility of this  change throws much light on many of the phenomena of nutrition in plants  and animals. Indeed, it would seem probable that these compounds are  formed from their elements by plants only, and are merely assimilated by  animals to produce the nitrogenous constituents they contain.    _Diastase_ is the name applied to a substance existing in malt, and  obtained by macerating that substance with cold water, and adding a  quantity of alcohol to the fluid, when the diastase is immediately  precipitated in white flocks. It is produced during the malting process,  and is not found in the unmalted barley. Its chemical composition is  unknown, but it is nitrogenous, and is believed to be produced by the  decomposition of gluten. If a very small quantity of diastase be mixed  with starch suspended in hot water, the starch is found gradually to  dissolve, and to pass first into the state of dextrine, then into that  of sugar. The change thus effected takes place also in a precisely  similar manner in the plant, diastase being produced during the process  of germination of all seeds and tubers, for the purpose of effecting  this change, and to fulfil other functions less understood, but no doubt  equally important. Diastase is found in the seeds only during the period  when the starch they contain is passing into sugar; as soon as that  change has taken place, its function is ended, and it disappears.          CHAPTER III.    THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE FOOD OF PLANTS DURING THEIR GROWTH.      The simple compounds which the plant absorbs from the atmosphere and  soil are elaborated within its system, and converted into the various  complex substances of which its tissues are composed, by a series of  changes, the details of which are still in some respects imperfectly  known, although their general nature is sufficiently well understood.  They may be best rendered intelligible by reference, in the first  instance, to the changes occurring during germination, when the young  plant is nourished by a supply of food stored up in the seed, in  sufficient quantity to maintain its existence until the organs by which  it is afterwards to draw its nutriment from the air and soil are  sufficiently developed to serve that purpose.    _Changes occurring during Germination._--When a seed is placed in the  soil under favourable circumstances, it becomes the seat of an important  and remarkable series of chemical changes, which result in the  production of the young plant. Experiment and observation have shown  that heat, moisture, and air, are necessary to the production of these  changes, and though probably not absolutely essential, the absence of  light is favourable in the early stages. The temperature required for  germination varies greatly in different seeds, some germinating readily  at a few degrees above the freezing point, and others requiring a  tolerably high temperature. The rapidity with which it takes place  appears to increase with the temperature; but this is true only within  very narrow limits, for beyond a certain point heat is injurious, and  when it exceeds 120 deg. or 130 deg. Fahrenheit, entirely prevents the process.  The presence of oxygen is also essential, for it has been shown that if  seeds are placed in a soil exposed to an atmosphere deprived of that  element, or if they be buried so deep that the air does not reach them,  they may lie without change for an unlimited period; but so soon as they  are exposed to the air, germination immediately commences. Illustrations  of this fact are frequently observed where earth from a considerable  depth has been thrown up to the surface, when it often becomes covered  with plants not usually seen in the neighbourhood, which have sprung  from buried seeds. When all the necessary conditions for germination are  fulfilled, the seed absorbs moisture, swells up, and sends out a shoot  which rises to the surface, and a radicle which descends--the one  destined to develop the leaves, the other the roots, by which the plant  is afterwards to derive its nutriment from the air and the soil. But  until these organs are properly developed, the plant is dependent on the  matters contained in the seed itself. These substances are mostly  insoluble, but are brought into solution by the atmospheric oxygen  acting upon the gluten, and converting it into a soluble substance  called diastase, which in its turn reacts upon the starch, converting it  first into dextrine, and then into cellulose, and the latter is finally  deposited in the form of organised cells, and produces the first little  shoot of the plant. At the first moment of germination, the oxygen  absorbed appears simply to oxidize the constituents of the seed, but  this condition exists only for a very limited period, and is soon  followed by the evolution of carbonic acid, water being at the same time  formed from the organic constituents of the seed, which gradually  diminishes in weight. The amount of this diminution is different with  different plants, but always considerable. Boussingault found that the  loss of dry substance in the pea amounted in 26 days to 52 per cent, and  in wheat to 57 per cent in 51 days. Against this, of course, is to be  put the weight of the young plant produced; but this is never sufficient  to counterbalance the diminished weight of the seed, for Saussure found  that a horse bean and the plant produced from it weighed, after 16 days,  less by 29 per cent than the seed before germination. The same  phenomenon is observed in the process of malting, which is in fact the  artificial germination of barley, the malt produced always weighing  considerably less than the grain from which it was obtained. It was  believed by Saussure, and the older investigators, that the carbonic  acid evolved was entirely produced from starch and sugar; and as these  substances may be viewed as compounds of carbon and water, the change  was very simply explained by supposing that the carbon was oxidised and  converted into carbonic acid and its water eliminated. But this  hypothesis is incapable of explaining all the phenomena observed; for  woody fibre, which is one of the chief constituents of the young plant,  contains more carbon than the starch and sugar from which it must have  been produced, and we are, therefore, forced to admit that the action  must be more complicated. There is every reason to believe that the  nitrogenous constituents of the seed are most abundantly oxidized, for  they are remarkably prone to change; but the action of the air is not  confined to them, and it appears most probable that all the substances  take part in the decomposition, and the process of germination may, in  some respects, be compared to decay or putrefaction, which, like it, is  attended by the absorption of oxygen and evolution of carbonic acid; but  while in the latter case the residual substances remain in a useless  state, in the former they at once become part of a new organism.    _Changes occurring during the After-growth of the Plant._--When the  plant has developed its roots and leaves, and exhausted the store of  materials laid up for it in the seed, it begins to derive its  subsistence from the surrounding air, and to absorb carbonic acid,  water, ammonia, and nitric acid, and to decompose and convert them into  the different constituents of its tissues. These changes take place  slowly at first, and more rapidly as the organs fitted for the  elaboration of its food are developed. The roots and the leaves are  equally active in performing this duty, the former absorbing the mineral  matters along with the carbonic acid, ammonia, nitric acid, and moisture  in the soil, or the manure added to it; the latter gathering the gaseous  substances existing in the air. Each of these undergoes a series of  changes claiming our consideration.    _Decomposition of Carbonic Acid._--Carbonic acid, which appears to be  absorbed with equal readiness by the roots, leaves, and stems, undergoes  immediate decomposition, its carbon being retained, and its oxygen, in  whole or in part, evolved into the air. This decomposition occurs only  under the action of the sun's rays, and has been found to be  proportionate to the amount of light to which the plant is exposed. It  takes place only in the green parts of plants, for though the roots  absorb carbonic acid, they cannot decompose it, or evolve oxygen; and  the coloured parts, the flowers, fruits, etc., have an entirely opposite  effect, absorbing oxygen and giving off carbonic acid. The absorption of  carbonic acid and escape of oxygen has been proved by numerous direct  experiments by Saussure and others, in which both atmospheric air and  artificial mixtures containing an increased quantity of carbonic acid  have been employed. Saussure allowed seven plants of periwinkle (_Vinca  minor_) to vegetate in an atmosphere containing 7.5 per cent of carbonic  acid for six days, during each of which the apparatus was exposed for  six hours to the sun's rays. The air was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#11)"],[1," on more  energetically and more openly.    But beyond them, and of infinitely more importance, there was one fact  which dominated the situation and retarded the crisis. A burgher cannot  go to war without his horse, his horse cannot move without grass, grass  will not come until after rain, and it was still some weeks before the  rain would be due. Negotiations, then, must not be unduly hurried while  the veldt was a bare russet-coloured dust-swept plain. Mr. Chamberlain  and the British public waited week after week for an answer. But there  was a limit to their patience, and it was reached on August 26, when the  Colonial Secretary showed, with a plainness of speech which is as  unusual as it is welcome in diplomacy, that the question could not be  hung up for ever. 'The sands are running down in the glass,' said he.  'If they run out we shall not hold ourselves limited by that which we  have already offered, but, having taken the matter in hand, we will not  let it go until we have secured conditions which once for all shall  establish which is the paramount power in South Africa, and shall secure  for our fellow-subjects there those equal rights and equal privileges  which were promised them by President Kruger when the independence of  the Transvaal was granted by the Queen, and which is the least that in  justice ought to be accorded them.' Lord Salisbury, a short time before,  had been equally emphatic: 'No one in this country wishes to disturb the  conventions so long as it is recognised that while they guarantee the  independence of the Transvaal on the one side, they guarantee equal  political and civil rights for settlers of all nationalities upon the  other. But these conventions are not like the laws of the Medes and the  Persians. They are mortal, they can be destroyed ... and once destroyed  they can never be reconstructed in the same shape.' The long-enduring  patience of Great Britain was beginning to show signs of giving way.    Pressure was in the meanwhile being put upon the old President and upon  his advisers, if he can be said ever to have had any advisers, in order  to induce him to accept the British offer of a joint committee of  inquiry. Sir Henry de Villiers, representing the highest Africander  opinion of the Cape, wrote strongly pleading the cause of peace, and  urging Mr. Fischer of the Free State to endeavour to give a more  friendly tone to the negotiations. 'Try to induce President Kruger to  meet Mr. Chamberlain in a friendly way, and remove all the causes of  unrest which have disturbed this unhappy country for so many years.'  Similar advice came from Europe. The Dutch minister telegraphed as  follows:    '_August 4, 1899._--Communicate confidentially to the President that,  having heard from the Transvaal Minister the English proposal of the  International Commission, I recommend the President, in the interest of  the country, not peremptorily to refuse that proposition.'    '_August 15, 1899._--Please communicate confidentially to the President  that the German Government entirely shares my opinion expressed in my  despatch of August 4, not to refuse the English proposal. The German  Government is, like myself, convinced that every approach to one of the  Great Powers in this very critical moment will be without any results  whatever, and very dangerous for the Republic.'    But neither his Africander brothers nor his friends abroad could turn  the old man one inch from the road upon which he had set his foot. The  fact is, that he knew well that his franchise proposals would not bear  examination; that, in the words of an eminent lawyer, they 'might as  well have been seventy years as seven,' so complicated and impossible  were the conditions. For a long time he was silent, and when he at last  spoke it was to open a new phase of the negotiations. His ammunition was  not all to hand yet, his rifles had not all been distributed, the grass  had not appeared upon the veldt. The game must be kept going for a  couple of months. 'You are such past-masters in the art of gaining  time!' said Mr. Labouchere to Mr. Montague White. The President  proceeded to prove it.    His new suggestions were put forward on August 12. In them the Joint  Commission was put aside, and the proposal was made that the Boer  Government should accede to the franchise proposals of Sir Alfred Milner  on condition that the British Government withdrew or dropped her claim  to a suzerainty, agreed to arbitration by a British and South African  tribunal, and promised never again to interfere in the internal affairs  of the Republic. To this Great Britain answered that she would agree to  such arbitration; that she hoped never again to have occasion to  interfere for the protection of her own subjects, but that with the  grant of the franchise all occasion for such interference would pass  away; and, finally, that she would never consent to abandon her position  as suzerain power. Mr. Chamberlain's despatch ended by reminding the  Government of the Transvaal that there were other matters of dispute  open between the two Governments apart from the franchise, and that it  would be as well to have them settled at the same time. By these he  meant such questions as the position of the native races and the  treatment of Anglo-Indians.    For a moment there seemed now to be a fair prospect of peace. There was  no very great gap between the two parties, and had the negotiations  been really _bona fide_ it seems incredible that it could not be  bridged. But the Transvaal was secure now of the alliance of the Orange  Free State; it believed that the Colony was ripe for rebellion; and it  knew that with 60,000 cavalry and 100 guns it was infinitely the  strongest military power in Africa. One cannot read the negotiations  without being convinced that they were never meant to succeed, and the  party which did not mean them to succeed was the party which prepared  all the time for war. De Villiers, a friendly critic, says of the  Transvaal Government: 'Throughout the negotiations they have always been  wriggling to prevent a clear and precise decision.' Surely the sequel  showed clearly enough why this was so. Their military hand was stronger  than their political one, and it was with that that they desired to play  the game. It would not do, therefore, to get the negotiations into such  a stage that a peaceful solution should become inevitable. What was the  use of all those rifles and cannon if the pen were after all to effect a  compromise? 'The only thing that we are afraid of,' wrote young  Blignant, 'is that Chamberlain with his admitted fitfulness of temper  should cheat us out of our war and, consequently, the opportunity of  annexing the Cape Colony and Natal, and forming the Republican United  States of South Africa'--a legitimate national ambition perhaps, but not  compatible with _bona-fide_ peaceful negotiations.    It was time, then, to give a less promising turn to the situation. On  September 2 the answer of the Transvaal Government was returned. It was  short and uncompromising. They withdrew their offer of the franchise.  They reasserted the non-existence of the suzerainty. The negotiations  were at a deadlock. It was difficult to see how they could be reopened.  In view of the arming of the burghers, the small garrison of Natal had  been taking up positions to cover the frontier. The Transvaal asked for  an explanation of their presence. Sir Alfred Milner answered that they  were guarding British interests, and preparing against contingencies.  The roar of the fall was sounding loud and near.    On September 8 there was held a Cabinet Council--one of the most  important in recent years. The military situation was pressing. The  handful of troops in Africa could not be left at the mercy of the large  and formidable force which the Boers could at any time hurl against  them. On the other hand, it was very necessary not to appear to threaten  or to appeal to force. For this reason reinforcements were sent upon  such a scale as to make it evident that they were sent for defensive,  and not for offensive, purposes. Five thousand men were sent from India  to Natal, and the Cape garrisons were strengthened from England.    At the same time that they took these defensive measures, a message was  sent to Pretoria, which even the opponents of the Government have  acknowledged to be temperate, and offering the basis for a peaceful  settlement. It begins by repudiating emphatically the claim of the  Transvaal to be a sovereign international State in the same sense in  which the Orange Free State is one. Any proposal made conditional upon  such an acknowledgment could not be entertained. The status of the  Transvaal was settled by certain conventions agreed to by both  Governments, and nothing had occurred to cause us to acquiesce in a  radical change in it.    The British Government, however, was prepared to accept the five years'  franchise as stated in the note of August 19, assuming at the same time  that in the Raad each member might use his own language.    'Acceptance of these terms by the South African Republic would at once  remove tension between the two Governments, and would in all probability  render unnecessary any future intervention to secure redress for  grievances which the Uitlanders themselves would be able to bring to the  notice of the Executive Council and the Volksraad.    'Her Majesty's Government are increasingly impressed with the danger of  further delay in relieving the strain which has already caused so much  injury to the interests of South Africa, and they earnestly press for an  immediate and definite reply to the present proposal. If it is acceded  to they will be ready to make immediate arrangements ... to settle all  details of the proposed tribunal of arbitration.... If, however, as they  most anxiously hope will not be the case, the reply of the South African  Republic"]]]
