The afterglow faded  in the western sky around the old church beyond the village gardens; and  the night, though one by one the stars were lighted overhead, became so  dark that I could see nothing plainly except the white froth, in large  round masses, floating idly down the pool. I waited impatiently for the  moon to rise, for I feared lest the faint, occasional plashes in the  pool indicated that the otter had left her \"holt,\" and would probably be  fishing in a distant pool when an opportunity for observation arrived.    The night was strangely impressive, as it always is to me while I roam  through the woodlands or lie in hiding to watch the creatures that haunt  the gloom-wrapt clearings among the oaks and the beeches. In the  darkness, long intervals, during which nothing will be seen or heard,  must of necessity be spent by the naturalist; and in such intervals the  mind is often filled with what may, perhaps, be best described as the  spiritual influence of night, when the eyes turn upward to the stars or  to the lights of a lone farmstead twinkling through the trees, and  imagination, wondering greatly at its own daring, links time with  eternity, and the destinies of this little world with the affairs of a  limitless universe.    At length the rim of the full moon appeared above the crest of the hill  behind the village, and gradually, as the orb ascended, the night became  brighter, till the whole surface of the pool, except for a fleeting  shadow, was clear and white, and a broad silver bar lay across the  ripples between me and the reed-bed on the further side. For a time no  sign of a living creature was visible; then a brown rat crept along the  bank beneath my hiding place; a dim form, which from its size I  concluded was that of Lutra, the otter, crossed a spit of sand about a  dozen yards above the reed-bed, where a moonbeam glanced through the  alders; and a big brown owl, silhouetted against the sky, flew silently  up-stream, and perched on a low, bare branch of a Scotch fir beside the  grass-grown path.    After another uneventful interval a slight movement was observable in  the reeds directly opposite. Straight in the line of the silver bar a  water-vole came towards me, only the head of the little swimmer being  visible at the apex of a V-shaped wake lengthening rapidly behind him.  More than half-way across the pool a large boulder stood out of the  water, but the vole was heading towards the bank above. Then, apparently  without cause, he turned quickly and made straight for the stone. He had  barely landed and run round to hide in a shallow depression of the stone  when the water seemed to swell and heave immediately beside the boulder,  and Lutra's head, with wide-open jaws, shot above the current.  Disappointed, the otter vanished under the shining surface of the  stream, came to sight once more in an eddy between the boulder and the  bank, and once more disappeared. I was keenly interested, for every  movement of the vole and the otter had been plainly discernible, so  bright was the night, and so close were the creatures to my hiding  place; and, raising myself slightly, I crawled a few inches nearer the  edge of the overhanging bank.    [Illustration: \"AN OPPORTUNITY CAME, WHICH, HAD SHE BEEN POISED IN THE  AIR, COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN MISSED.\"]    For a long time the vole, not daring to move, remained in the shadow. I  had almost concluded that he had dived through some crevice into the  dark water on the other side of the boulder, when he cautiously lifted  his head to the light, and crept into a grass-clump on the top of the  stone. Thence, after a little hesitation, he moved to the edge, as if  contemplating a second swim. Fastidious as to his toilet, even in the  presence of danger, he rose on his haunches and washed his round, furry  face. The action was almost fatal. The brown owl, that had doubtless  seen him by the grass-clump and had therefore left her perch in the  fir-tree, dropped like a bolt and hovered, with wings nearly touching  the silver stream, above the spot where she had marked her prey. But she  was too late--the vole had dived. Yet, even while, having alighted on  the boulder, the owl stood baffled by the disappearance of the vole, an  opportunity came, which, had she been poised in the air, could scarcely  have been missed. Close to the near bank a wave rose above the surface  of the eddy as Lutra, having seen the vole dive from the stone, again  hurried in pursuit. So fast was the otter that the momentum carried her  well into the shallows. But for the third time the vole escaped. I  indistinctly saw him scramble out, and run, with a shrill squeak, across  a ridge of sand, offering a second chance to the listening owl; and,  from his flight in the direction of the well known burrow, I concluded  that the hunted creature was russet-coated little Brighteye. But the  bird knew that she could not rise and swoop in time; so, probably  disturbed by the presence of the otter, she flew away down-stream just  as Lutra, since the vole was out of reach, glided from the sand and  philosophically turned her attention to less evasive trout and eels.    Then all was motionless and silent, but for an occasional faint whistle  as Lutra fished in the backwater at the throat of the pool, the wailing  cry of the owl from the garden on the crest of the slope behind me, and  the ceaseless, gentle ripple of the river. At last, when the voices of  the otter and the owl were still, and when the shadows were  foreshortened as the moon gazed coldly down between the branches of the  fir, Brighteye, having recovered from his recent fright, left his  sanctuary by the roots of the willow, and wandered, singing, singing,  down the white, winding run-way and out into the main road of the  riverside people, till he came to a jutting branch above the river's  brim, whence he dived into the placid pool, and swam away towards the  reed-bed. Then the crossed shadows of the flags and hemlocks screened  him from my sight.    The first autumn in the water-vole's life was a season of wonderful  beauty. A few successive frosts chilled the sap in the trees and the  bushes near the river, but were succeeded by a long period when the air  was crisp yet balmy, and not a breath of wind was noticeable except by  the birds and the squirrels high among the giant beeches around the old  garden, and when the murmur of summer insects was never heard by night,  and only by day if a chance drone-fly or humble-bee visited a surviving  clump of yellow ragweed by the run-way close to Brighteye's burrow. The  elms and the sycamores glowed with purple and bronze, the ash-trees and  the willows paled to lemon yellow, the oaks arrayed themselves in rich  and glossy olive green; while the beeches in the glade, and the brambles  along the outskirts of the thickets, ruddy and golden and glittering in  the brief, delicious autumn days, seemed to filter and yet stain the  mellow sunshine, and to fill each nook with liquid shadow as pure and  glorious as the blue and amber lights on the undulating hills. Spread on  the bosom of the brimming river, and broken, here and there, by creamy  lines of passing foam, the reflections of this beauty seemed to well and  bubble, from unfathomable deeps, around the \"sly, fat fishes sailing,  watching all.\"    The water became much colder than in summer; but Brighteye, protected by  a warm covering of thick, soft fur through which the moisture could not  penetrate, as well as by an over-garment of longer, coarser hair from  which the drops were easily shaken when he left the stream, hardly  noticed the change of temperature. But he well knew there were changes  in the surroundings of his home. The flags in the reed-bed were not so  succulent as they had been in early summer; the branches that sometimes  guided him as he swam from place to place seemed strangely bare and  grey; the clump of may-weed that, growing near his burrow, had served as  a beacon in the gloom, was faded to a few short brown tufts; and  nightly in his wanderings he was startled by the withered leaves that,  like fluttering birds, descended near him on the littered run-ways or on  the glassy surface of the river-reach. It was long before he became  accustomed to the falling of the leaves, and up to the time when every  bough was bare the rustling flight of a great chestnut plume towards him  never failed to rouse the fear first wakened by the owl, and to send him  on a long, breathless dive to the bottom of the pool.    Brighteye was a familiar figure to all the river-folk, while he, in  turn, knew most of them, and had learned to distinguish between friends  and foes. But occasionally he made a slight mistake. Though shy, he was  as curious as the squirrel that, one afternoon when Brighteye was early  abroad, hopped down the run-way to make his acquaintance, and frightened  him into a precipitate retreat, then ran out to a branch above the  stream and loudly derided the creature apparently drowning in the  stream.    An object of ceaseless curiosity to Brighteye was a water-shrew, not  more than half the size of the vole, that had come to dwell in the  pool, and had tunnelled out a burrow in the bank above the reed-bed.  Nightly, after supper, Brighteye made a circuit of the pool to find the  shrew, and with his companion swam hither and thither, till, startled by  some real or imagined danger, each of the playmates hurried to refuge,  and was lost awhile to the other amid the darkness and the solitude of  the silent hours.    Brighteye soon became aware of the fact that some of the habits of the  shrew were entirely different from his own. While the vole was almost  entirely a vegetable feeder, the shrew, diving to the bed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#11)"],[1,"modern writers that the physical  change from youth to age is accompanied in the body, and in a sense  caused by, the deterioration in the quality of the cells of the body,  and they call this change a breaking-down process by which the finer and  more highly differentiated cells, such, for example, as the nerve-cells,  and others which have high and complicated duties to perform, are  displaced by cells of an inferior type, which they name conjunctive  cells, much as the common sparrow drives away the songbirds from the  home garden and, usurping the place of the songbird, substitutes a  wretched twitter for the golden notes of the warblers which once  delighted our ears. The common cells, also, on usurping the place of the  nobler cells, are unable to perform the difficult duties of the latter,  and the result upon human organism is disorder, decay, disease, etc.,  contributing to, if not causing, the condition of old age. This is an  ingenious but not convincing theory. Our knowledge of histological  processes is too incomplete at this stage to permit its acceptance as  fact. It assumes too much to be known which is quite unknown. Moreover,  it refutes itself upon examination in this particular, and in several  others, that if it were true that these inferior cells are on the  lookout to invade instantly any part of the human organism in which  there was a breaking down of nerve-tissue, for example, then it would be  impossible to build new nerve-tissue to take the place of that which was  destroyed, because its place, according to this theory, has been already  taken by an intruder who cannot be dislodged. But new nerve-cells are  constantly being rebuilt, and constantly being put to use in the  organism. If this theory were true, then a brain in middle age would be  unable to function because of the impossibility of renewing its cells.    A much more reasonable and probably true explanation of the cause of old  age is the gradual disappearance of animal matter in the bones and  tissues, and the corresponding increase of the mineral matter in the  bones and tissues, amounting to ossification of cartilage, whereby the  supple cartilage, losing its animal content, becomes practically bone by  deposit of lime particles. This would also account in a common-sense  manner for the fragility of the bones of the aged, the brittleness being  due to calcareous deposits in the substance of the bone itself, in  excess of the normal mineral contents of the bones in youth. The  function of the seminal fluids, therefore, appears to be to restore to  the aging tissues this property, this animal matter, which when in its  right ratio and proportion in the cells of the organism produces the  condition of youth. The action of these seminal fluids, therefore, seems  to be two-fold, a dissolving and a nourishing. The distinction should be  clearly made that the action is NOT merely stimulating. The stimulation  of a nerve-cell is a temporary excitement. We speak of the stimulation  of alcohol, and this illustration gives a clearer view of the difference  between the nourishing action of the seminal fluids and a stimulating  action than we could obtain by the employment of many words. It is  interesting to remember that while it is possible to increase the  mineral particles of soda, potash, lime, iron, silica and magnesia in  the blood and lymph, it is practically impossible for us to increase the  animal contents of the cells by any method of medication or dieting  known to us. Only Life can produce this change in the cells, and only  this method of gland-transplantation has furnished a means of impressing  Life into service to work for us in this matter. To produce the effects  which are needed to rejuvenate a body that has increased its mineral  matter at the expense of its animal matter we require the co-operation  of glands made active, because only the glands, in the marvelous  chemistry of the body, are able to compound the animal substances  required to nourish the cells, tissues and organs of the body, and to  dissolve and remove those injurious substances of a mineral nature which  have accumulated in excess in cells and tissues, usurping the place of  the animal matter in the cells because of the inactivity of function  generally, and the poor elimination of waste matter, as the years pass.  This is the re-creative and rejuvenating work of the gland secretions.  It is beyond us to say exactly what these secretions consist of. We know  the importance of their presence in blood and lymph only by the  disasters that follow their absence. The thyroid gland and parathyroids,  for instance, seem to be connected by some close sympathy with the  activity or non-activity of the interstitial glands, and the atrophy of  one is often accompanied by the atrophy of the other. The subject is  still hidden in darkness to the extent of insufficient knowledge on our  part of the exact constituents of the active agents in the secretions of  the testes, thyroids, suprarenals, pituitary and other glands. Time and  further opportunity for experiment are needed to show to what extent the  goat-gland transplantation can be used to remedy goitre, epilepsy and  the graver lesions of paralysis. The use of the goat-glands is too  recent to admit of anything but speculation on these points. There would  seem to be no good reason to doubt that if the male organs of a young  goat do rejuvenate the atrophied testes of a man, which Dr. Brinkley has  abundantly proved they do, the thyroid gland of a young goat might be  expected to restore the atrophied thyroid of a human being. This again  is only conjecture, Dr. Brinkley's work up to the present having been  confined to the transplantation of testes and ovaries. But he expects to  find time during the present year to satisfy himself of the results of  such important experimental work as is here indicated. It is possible  that his visit to Europe this summer may be the means of enlarging his  field considerably, although it would appear that if he had six pairs of  hands and could keep all employed in continuous service he could  scarcely cope with the demands upon his time which any and all countries  of the earth may be expected to make when his work is known. In ten  years, no doubt, gland-transplantation, particularly goat-gland  transplantation, for the renewal of youth in man and woman will be so  usual as to occasion neither wonder nor hilarity. But we are not living  ten years from now, but at this present moment, and Dr. Brinkley's  operation to-day is a marvel, a wonder and a joy. There is a  satisfaction in being in the van. It is fine to be the first to do a big  thing, especially if that big thing is something of the most practical  value to humanity. Mankind has always crowned its great generals, its  great destroyers of life. Here is a man who comes forward to preserve  life. That is his mission, if you like. Certainly it is his life work.  It is a noble work. The question in the writer's mind is, What will they  do to him? How will they take him in England? Will they applaud, or  crucify, or neglect? Probably they will show him something of the  generous hospitality of England, and leaven this with a plentiful  sprinkling of ridicule, because the subject of the goat lends itself to  humor of the obvious kind. But it is our belief that the hard, practical  common sense of the Anglo-Saxon will lead them to make the utmost use of  this opportunity of his visit, and, having got him, it is to be expected  that they will know enough to keep him. This is quite as much their  opportunity as his. While they sharpen their wit upon the sacrificial  goat and make merry, they are pretty sure to make full use of his  knowledge and skill while they have him with them, and might make things  so pleasant for him that he might say, when the summer is over and he  looks back upon the white cliffs of Dover, returning to his own country,  \"This is a good land. I have enjoyed the trip. I like the people. I will  return next summer, and for many summers thereafter.\"          CHAPTER X    THE SPARK OF LIFE      +By J. R. Brinkley, M.D., C.M., Ph.D., Sc.D.+      Chief Surgeon, Brinkley-Jones Hospital and Training School    for Nurses, Milford, Kansas        (Written October, 1920)    For many years scientists have believed that a part, or all of the  glands of the human body influenced longevity. They believed our glands  contained the \"life spark.\" Men for hundreds of years have been seeking  the \"fountain of youth.\" Ponce de Leon when he landed in Florida and saw  the beautiful springs and flowers thought he had found it, and so  announced to the world. Long ago we learned that the pituitary gland  influenced growth and development. For instance if the pituitary gland  over-functioned we had Giantism. If it under-functioned the opposite was  the result--a dwarf. If the thyroid gland was at fault we would have  either the low mentality commonly spoken of as cretinism, or myxedema.  We found that by feeding children the fresh gland substance a marked  improvement would be obtained and sometimes a cure. Some years ago there  was a surgical craze which called for the removal of the women's  ovaries. It was thought that many nervous troubles, including epilepsy,  etc., were due to diseased ovaries, so the surgeons removed ovaries just  about as promiscuously as tonsils and teeth are now taken out. After a  while they found a woman without ovaries was about ruined, so something  had to be done, and ovarian extracts and substances were fed to the  unfortunates. Good results were obtained so long as the feeding process  kept up, but if the feeding was stopped, the miserable symptoms  returned. One factor was always in evidence, that a woman who had no  ovaries never menstruated again. Premature change of life (menopause)  resulted. Ageing took place early.
