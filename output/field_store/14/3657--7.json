This should be  woven with a tape needle. Weave the border at the foot of the loom. This  extends the entire width. Place the extra rods two inches toward the  center from the side rods on the outside of the rug, keeping them _back_  of the border already woven at the foot. This will outline the sides of  the plain oblong in the center. Weave the left and right hand borders up  to a point two inches from the head piece, taking care to go around the  rods just placed. Then begin the plain center. As you come to the border  on each side, run your tape needle _through_ the loops of mottled  silkoline which are around the rod, but do not go around the rod itself  with the plain silkoline, since doing so would make a ridge in the rug.  Draw the woof strips tightly and firmly, so that the work will lie flat  and smooth when removed from the loom. Be sure to weave the center far  enough, remembering that the upper woof strips in the border will crowd  it down. When the center is finished, remove the extra rods and finish  weaving the border to the head piece. In selecting a color for the  center, match one of the colors in the figured silkoline. The color for  the center in the rug of the illustration on page 90 is green, and the  same color appears also in the mottled border, with yellow and brown.  The ends should be left plain, the warp strings being concealed as  directed. These rugs are very beautiful, and can be made in an infinite  variety through the use of different colors, and by reversing the center  and border. They can be made of carpet or Germantown wool, in two colors  or in two tones of one color. In weaving rugs with centers and borders,  weave a little farther than the exact measure, because the next woof  threads will push down the woof already made, and you may find that you  have not woven the correct measure. These rugs are useful as \"heel  rugs\"; they are placed under the piano near the pedal to protect the  carpet from the pressure of the heel. (See also page 82.)    [Illustration: _A plain silkoline rug, with a mottled border_]    [Sidenote: _Holder or mat_]    [Sidenote: _Many squares joined together_]    [Sidenote: _Small rug with fringe_]    [Sidenote: _Stair and hall carpets_]    Adjust the loom for the size required. The plaid effect in the holder  illustrated on page 92 is obtained by stringing a close warp with green  and white carpet wool, alternating two of white with four of green. In  weaving, use two woof threads of white and _four_ of green to make the  square correct. The kindergarten designs make pretty holders. If you  have woven a holder, it will be finished when it is removed from the  loom and the warp strings have been fastened. If you wish your holder to  be very thick, weave two of these pieces, lay a square of felt or  flannel between and sew or crochet the edges together. If the work is to  be a mat, knot a pretty fringe all around it. Many of these squares can  be joined to make sofa pillows, afghans, slumber robes, and other dainty  articles. With a continuous warp, one can weave long strips for the same  articles. If a small rug for Miss Dolly's bedroom is desired, string the  warp so that the two ends will have a fringe. Stair and hall carpets for  the doll house can be woven in these pretty designs by adjusting the  loom for a narrow strip, and, if necessary, a continuous warp.    [Illustration: _Holder of green and white carpet wool_]          Chapter Nine    HAMMOCKS      [Illustration: _Back of loom, showing method of stringing warp through  rings for a hammock_]    [Sidenote: _Method of adjustment_]    [Sidenote: _Use of stripes for various colors_]    [Sidenote: _Lengthwise stripes_]    To weave a hammock, one must first adjust the loom to its full size. Tie  two rings together and fasten them at the back of the loom, to head,  foot, and sides, as in the illustration. One must then decide how close  the warp is to be strung. Measure the string, which should be  continuous, allowing enough to go to the rings at the back and make a  buttonhole stitch each time. Then wind on a long thin stick or dress  steel, in such a way that it will pass easily through the rings. In  stringing the hammock in the illustration, a penholder was used. The  rings are tied, with white cord, to the four sides of the loom. By doing  this, all tangling of the warp string is avoided, and it is far  preferable to splicing. Tie the first warp string to the top ring. Draw  it tightly through the first groove, over the face of the loom to the  opposite groove, then to the back of the loom through the bottom ring.  Make a buttonhole stitch and return in the same manner over the face of  the loom, around to the top ring, where you make a buttonhole stitch and  return, until the whole warp is strung. Care should be taken to make it  firm and tight. Hold the string and ring firmly in the left hand while  making the buttonhole stitch with the right. Cut the woof cords long  enough to allow a fringe on each side of the hammock. Weave each cord  separately, tying in pairs around the rods. Stripes of one or more  colors can be woven at each end or at intervals through the hammock. By  weaving two colors alternately, the stripes will be lengthwise instead  of crosswise. Knot the fringe at each side. To fasten the top and bottom  woof cords so that they will not pull out of place, thread a tape needle  with cord and tie each warp string close to the woof. Another way to  secure the top and bottom woof cords is to weave two cords at one time,  twisting one over the other between the warp strings. The bottom one  should be woven before the hammock is commenced. The top one can be  woven before the hammock is finished, and pushed up close to the head  piece. Then fill up the space.    [Illustration: _A hammock made from strings of different colors in  lengthwise stripes_]    [Sidenote: _Making the fringe_]    [Sidenote: _The stretcher_]    [Sidenote: _The head-rest_]    [Sidenote: _Hammock with lengthwise colored stripes_]    [Sidenote: _Knotted hammocks_]    Instead of knotting the fringe as suggested, two cords can be twisted at  each side of the hammock in the same way that the woof cords are secured  at the top and bottom. This forms a heading for the fringe. Take up  _two_ cords of the fringe at a time. If desired, the strings which  extend from the rings to the hammock may be woven for the space of an  inch or so close to the rings instead of making a buttonhole stitch.  Make a stretcher for the head by covering a piece of rattan with  buttonhole stitch. Fasten this to the hammock. A head-rest can also be  woven and adjusted. To remove the hammock from the loom, cut the two  rings apart, and then lift the warp strings from the grooves. A very  pretty hammock can be made by stringing the warp of different colors, in  order to make _lengthwise_ stripes. Weave a neutral color through them.  In this case, have a close warp. Pretty hammocks can be made by knotting  instead of weaving.    [Sidenote: _To string warp for hammock in order to have the sides  shorter than the center_]    Cut two semi-circular pieces from light wood or pasteboard. These should  suit the width of the hammock to be made. If this is the width of the  loom, then 9-1/2 inches long and two inches at the widest part. Cut the  curved edge in notches to correspond with the number taken in the head  piece. These pieces will be firmer and more satisfactory if made of wood  and finished at the lower edges like the metal head piece. This can be  easily done by glueing them to a narrow piece of wood so that they will  stand. If furnished with perforations, they can be laced to the head and  foot pieces or the rods can be run through them. By stringing the warp  in this way, the sides of the hammock will be shorter than the center,  and there will be no danger of Miss Dolly falling out.    The warp can be strung more quickly and easily if hammock hooks similar  to those in the two illustrations below are used. Measure the right  length--22 warp strings 31 inches long for the metal loom, or 29 the  same length for the wooden loom--and wind as before.    [Illustration: _Hook No. 1_]    [Illustration: _Hook No. 2_]    [Sidenote: _Hammock hooks_]    [Sidenote: _Weaving_]    In using hammock hook No. 1, knot half the number of warp strings in the  left-hand ring and half in the right-hand ring. If hook No. 2 be used,  unpin the part at the right, knot the warp strings along the straight  edge at the bottom, and then pin the right-hand part again. Weaving each  cord separately across the loom makes a heavy fringe at the sides. If a  lighter fringe be desired, cut the woof cords twice the width of the  loom plus twice the length of the fringe. Weave across the loom, leaving  enough for the fringe at the side, then _around_ the rod and back again,  drawing the cord through to the same length as the part left at first.  Weave in the same way with the second color, having the loop on the  _same_ rod and the fringe at the _same_ side as the other. Weave the  next two cords with loops on the _opposite_ rod and fringe on the  _opposite_ side. Continue in this way until the hammock is finished.  Make a heading at the sides as described, only carry the two cords  _through_ the loops, crossing them between on top of the rods. The warp  strings can be passed through the rings without buttonholing. A firm  pretty finish can be made at the sides by cutting two cords--one of each  color two yards long and buttonholing around the rods on _top_ of the  woof cords which extend at each side. Fasten these long cords at the  bottom of the loom. After two pairs of woof cords have been tied,  buttonhole the edge over them and around the rods and continue this  until the hammock is finished.

Several days before the ceremony the beadle invited all the  faithful; for it was a public festival, and everybody was  supposed to share in the joy of the bride and bridegroom.  On the  day of the wedding, the bridegroom, attended by the rabbi and men  of standing in the community and followed by other members of the  congregation, proceeded to the synagogue to the accompaniment of  music.  At the synagogue he was awaited by the bride, who was  surrounded by her maids of honor and by a number of women.  The  rabbi presented the young girl to the bridegroom, and he took her  hand, while the by-standers showered grains of wheat upon them  and small pieces of money, which were picked up by the poor.  Then, hand in hand, the couple walked to the door of the  synagogue, where they paused a while.  After this the bride was  led to her own home so that she might complete her toilet.  Under  a large mantle of silk and fur, with puffed sleeves, she wore a  white robe, symbol of the mourning for Zion, the memory of which  was not to leave her even on this day of joy.  The sign of  mourning adopted for the bridegroom was a special headgear.    After the bridegroom had returned to the synagogue and placed  himself near the Ark of the Law, the morning service was held.  Meanwhile the bride was led to the door of the synagogue, always  to the accompaniment of music, and the bridegroom, conducted by  the rabbi and the heads of the community, went to receive her  there.  He placed himself on her left, and preceded by his mother  and the mother of the bride, he guided her to the pulpit in the  centre [center sic] of the synagogue.  Here was pronounced the  nuptial benediction.    The ceremony over, the husband hastened to his home to meet his  wife and introduce her to the dwelling of which she was to be the  mistress.  Here it was that the wedding feast was spread.  Festivities continued for several days, and the following  Saturday special hymns were inserted in the service in honor of  the newlywedded couple.[25]  No parade or pomp marred the beauty  and grace of this ceremony, every act of which bespoke pure  poetry and religion.    From this it is evident how much domestic virtues were prized  among the Jews of the middle ages.  The family was expected to be  a model of union and harmony, of tenderness of mate toward mate  and parents toward children.  Gentleness and a spirit of trust  were to preside over the household.  Rashi, as we shall see,[26]  speaks in moving terms of the high regard which a man owes his  wife.                                   II    But it was not given to Rashi to pass untroubled through his  fruitful life of study.  A terrible shock surprised him.  The  eleventh century set in a sea of blood.    Some legends have a hardy life.  Not the least remarkable of these  is the myth that the Crusades were wholly inspired by religious  zeal.  These great European movements are always represented as  having been called forth by enthusiasm and thirst for self-  sacrifice.  A great wave of faith, we are told, swept over the  masses, and carried them on to the conquest of the Holy  Sepulchre.  There is another side to the shield-faith fawning on  political expediency and egoism, and turning brigand.  Without  doubt many Christians went on the Crusades impelled by religious  conviction.  But how many nourished less vague ideas in their  hearts?  Not to mention those whose only aim was to escape from  the consequences of their misdeeds and obtain absolution and  indulgences, not to mention those who were animated by a foolish  sense of chivalry, by love of adventure, of perilous risks, drawn  by the attraction of the unknown and the marvellous [marvelous  sic] - apart from these, there was the great mass, impelled by  greed and thirst for pillage.    Complaisant historians express their admiring wonder at these  \"hundreds of thousands of men fighting with their eyes doggedly  fixed upon the Holy Sepulchre and dying in order to conquer it.\"  They pity these \"multitudes of men who threw themselves on Islam  the unknown, these naive, trusting spirits, who each day imagined  themselves at Jerusalem, and died on the road thither.\" Would it  not be well for them to reserve a little of their admiration and  pity for the unfortunates that were the victims of these \"naive\"  multitudes? Ought they not to say that this religious fervor was  a mixture chiefly of blind hate and bloody fanaticism? After a  victory the Crusaders would massacre the populations of the  conquered cities, including in the slaughter not only the  Mohammedans but also the Oriental Christians.  Then why should we  wonder if on the road to Palestine they laid violent hands on the  Jews they found by the way?[27]    It is known what an important part France played in the First  Crusade.  From France issued the spark that set the entire  Occident aflame, and France furnished the largest contingent to  the Crusades.    However, the disorders in France were merely local.  If the rage  for blood enkindled by the First Crusade scarcely affected the  Jews of France, it is because the population was concentrated on  the banks of the Rhine.  But here its murderous frenzy knew no  bounds.  The people threw themselves on the Jewish communities of  Treves, Speyer, Worms, Mayence, and Cologne, and put to death all  who refused to be converted (May to July, 1096).  The noise of  events such as these perforce \"found a path through the sad  hearts\" of the Jews of Champagne; for they maintained lively and  cordial relations with their brethren in the Rhine lands, many  being bound to them by ties of kinship.  Among the martyrs of  1096 was Asher ha-Levi, who was the disciple of Isaac ben  Eleazar, Rashi's second teacher, and who died together with his  mother, his two brothers, and their families.  From a Hebrew text  we learn that the Jews of France ordered a fast and prayers in  commemoration of these awful massacres, the victims of which  numbered not less than ten thousand.    But all could not sacrifice their lives for the sake of their  faith.  Though so large a number were slain by the pious hordes  or slew one another in order to escape violence, others allowed  themselves to be baptized, or adopted Christianity, in appearance  at least.  After the Crusaders were at a distance, on the way to  their death in the Orient, the Jews left behind could again  breathe freely.  Of many of them, Gregory of Tours might have said  that \"the holy water had washed their bodies but not their  hearts, and, liars toward God, they returned to their original  heresy.\"  The emperor of Germany, Henry IV, it seems, even  authorized those who had been forced into baptism to return to  Judaism, and the baptized Jews hastened to throw off the hateful  mask.  This benevolent measure irritated the Christian clergy, and  the Pope bitterly reproached the Emperor.    What sadder, more curious spectacle than that which followed?  Many of those Jews who had remained faithful to their religion  would not consider the apostates as their brethren, unwilling  apostates though they had been, and strenuously opposed their  re-admission to the Synagogue.    This unwillingness to compound, showing so little generosity and  charity, must have distressed Rashi profoundly.  For, when  consulted in regard to the repulsed converts, he displayed a  loftiness of view and a breadth of tolerance which Maimonides  himself could not equal.  In similar circumstances Maimonides,  it seems, in intervening, yielded a little to personal  prepossession.  \"Let us beware,\" wrote Rashi, \"let us beware of  alienating those who have returned to us by repulsing them.  They  became Christians only through fear of death; and as soon as the  danger disappeared, they hastened to return to their faith.\"    Though the First Crusade affected the Jews of France only  indirectly, it none the less marks a definite epoch in their  history.  The fanaticism it engendered wreaked its fury upon the  Jews, against whom all sorts of odious charges were brought.  They were placed in the same category as sorcerers and lepers,  and among the crimes laid at their door were ritual murder and  piercing of the host.  The instigations of the clergy did not  remain without effect upon a people lulled to sleep by its  ignorance, but aroused to action by its faith.  The kings and  seigneurs on their side exploited the Jews, and expelled them  from their territories.    Rashi had the good fortune not to know these troublous times.  But  he discerned in a sky already overcast the threatening  premonitions of a tempest, and as though to guard his fellow-Jews  against the danger, he left them a work which was to be a  viaticum and an asylum to them.  When one sees how Rashi's work  brought nourishment, so to speak, to all later Jewish literature,  which was a large factor in keeping Israel from its threatened  ruin, one is convinced that Rashi, aside from his literary  efforts, contributed no slight amount toward the preservation and  the vitality of the Jewish people.    Even if the Crusades had not involved persecution of the Jews and  so provoked the noble intervention of Rashi, they would  nevertheless have made themselves felt in Champagne.  Count Hugo,  among others, remained in the Holy Land from 1104 to 1108; and  his brother was killed at Ramleh in 1102.  According to a rather  wide-spread legend, Rashi stood in intimate relations with one of  the principal chiefs of the Crusade, the famous duke of Lower  Lotharingia, Godfrey of Bouillon.  Historians have found that the  part actually played by the duke in the Crusades is smaller than  that ascribed to him by tradition, yet the profound impression he  made on the popular imagination has remained, and legend soon  endowed him with a fabulous genealogy, making of him an almost  mythical personage.  A favorite trick of the makers of legends is  to connect their"]]]
