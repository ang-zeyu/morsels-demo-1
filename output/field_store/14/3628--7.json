Walking out upon the snow a little way, he halted, at a distance of  perhaps thirty paces from the poachers. At the sound of his snowshoes  the two men looked up scowling and apprehensive; and the kneeling one  sprang to his feet. They wanted no witnesses of their illegal work.    \"Good morning,\" said the Boy politely.    At the sound of his soft young voice, the sight of his slender figure  and youthful face, their apprehensions vanished; but not their anger  at being discovered.    \"Mornin'!\" growled one, in a surly voice; while the other never opened  his mouth. Then they looked at each other with meaning question in  their eyes. How were they going to keep this unwelcome visitor from  betraying them?    \"I'm going to ask you,\" said the Boy sweetly, \"to be so kind as to  stop trapping on this pond. Of course you didn't know it, but this is  my pond, and there is no trapping allowed on it. It is reserved, you  know; and I don't want a single one of my beavers killed.\"    The man with the axe scowled fiercely and said nothing. But the other,  the one who had been driving the stakes, laughed in harsh derision.    \"You don't, hey, sonny?\" he answered. \"Well, you just wait an' watch  us. We'll show ye whose beaver they be!\" And turning his back in scorn  of his interlocutor's youth, he knelt down again to drive another  stake. The man who had not spoken, however, stood leaning on his axe,  eying the Boy with an ugly expression of menace.    The Boy's usually quiet blood was now pounding and tingling with  anger. His alert eyes had measured the whole situation, and noted that  the men had no firearms but their rifles, which were leaning against a  tree on the shore fully fifty yards behind them.    \"Stop!\" he cried, with so confident a tone of authority that the  kneeling man looked up, though with a sneer on his face. \"Unless you  go away from this pond at once, I'll get the men from the camp, and  they'll make you go. They'll not be so polite as I am. You're just  poachers, anyway. And the boys will like as not just run you clean out  of the country. Will you do as I ask you, or shall I go and get  them?\"    The man with the axe spat out some French curse which the Boy didn't  understand very clearly. But the man at the stakes jumped up again  with a dangerous grin.    \"You'll stay right where you are, sonny, till we're done with you,\" he  snarled. \"You understand? You're a-goin' to git hurt ef ye gits in our  way any! See?\"    The Boy was now in a white rage; but he kept his wits cool and his  eyes watchful. He realized at this moment that he was in great danger;  but, his mettle being sound, this only made him the more resolute.    \"All right. You've decided!\" he said slowly. \"We'll see what the boys  will have to say about it.\"    As he spoke he made a movement as if to turn, but without taking his  eyes from the enemy. The movement just served to swing his little  Winchester into a readier position.    At his first move the man with the axe took a step forward, and swung  up his axe with a peculiar gesture which the Boy understood. He had  seen the woodsmen throw their axes. He knew well their quickness and  their deadly precision. But quickness and precision with the little  Winchester were his own especial pride,--and, after all, he had not  turned any further than was just right for a good shot. Even as the  axe was on the verge of leaving the poacher's hand, the rifle cracked  sharply. The poacher yelled a curse, and his arm dropped. The axe flew  wide, landing nowhere near its aim. On the instant both the  half-breeds turned, and raced for their rifles on the shore.    \"Stop, or I'll shoot you both!\" shouted the Boy, now with embarrassment  added to his wrath. In their wild fury at being so balked by a boy,  both men trusted to his missing his aim--or to the hope that his gun  was not a repeater. They ignored his command, and rushed on. The Boy  was just going to shoot again, aiming at their legs; when, to his  amazement and inconceivable relief, out from behind the tree where the  poachers' rifles leaned, came Jabe.    Snatching up one of the guns, he echoed the Boy's command.    \"Stop _right_ there!\" he ordered curtly. \"An' up with your hands,  too! Mebbe youse kin fling a knife slick ez ye kin an axe.\"    The half-breeds stood like stones. One held up both hands; but the  other only held up his left, his right being helpless. They knew there  was nothing to say. They were fairly caught. They were poaching. The  tall lumberman had seen the axe flung. Their case was a black one; and  any attempt to explain could do no less than make it worse. They did  not even dare to look at each other, but kept their narrow, beady eyes  fixed on Jabe's face.    The Boy came swiftly to Jabe's side.    \"Neat shot!\" said the woodsman; but the note of astonished admiration  in his tone was the most thrilling compliment the Boy had ever  received.    \"What are you going to do with them, Jabe?\" he inquired, mildly.    \"That's fer you to say! They're yourn!\" answered Jabe, keeping his  eyes on the prisoners.    The Boy looked the two culprits over carefully, with his calm, boyish  gaze. He was overwhelmingly elated, but would have died rather than  show it. His air was that of one who is quite used to capturing two  outlaws,--and having axes hurled at his head,--and putting bullets  through men's shoulders. He could not help feeling sorry for the man  with the bullet through his shoulder.    \"Well, Jabe,\" he said presently, \"we can't let them go with their  guns, because they're such sneaking brutes, they'd shoot us from  behind a tree. And we can't let them go without their guns, because we  can't be sure they wouldn't starve before they got to their own homes.  And we don't want to take them into camp, for the fellows would  probably treat them as they deserve,--and I don't want them to get  anything so bad as that!\"    \"Maybe it _might_ be better not to let the hands git hold of 'em!\"  agreed Jabe. \"They'd be rough!\"    A gleam of hope came into the prisoners' eyes. The unwounded one  spoke. And he had the perspicacity to address himself to the Boy  rather than to Jabe, thereby conciliating the Boy appreciably.    \"Let us go!\" he petitioned, choking down his rage. \"We'll swear to  quit, right now an' fer good; an' not to try to git back at yez!\"    \"Ye'll have to leave yer guns!\" said Jabe sternly.    \"They're the only guns we got; an' they're our livin', fer the  winter!\" protested the half-breed, still looking at the Boy.    \"If we take away their guns, what's the good of making them swear?\"  demanded the Boy, stepping up and gazing into their eyes. \"No, I  reckon if they give their oath, they'll stick to it. Where's your  camp, men?\"    \"Over yonder, about three mile!\" answered the spokesman, nodding  toward the northeast.    \"If we give you back your guns,\" went on the Boy gently, \"will you  both give us your oath to clear right out of this country altogether,  and not trap at all this side of the line? And will you take oath,  also, that you will never, in any way, try to get even with either him  or me for having downed you this way?\"    \"Sartain!\" responded the spokesman, with obvious sincerity. \"I'll  swear to all that! An' I won't never _want_ to git even, if you use us  so gentlemanlike!\"    \"And will you swear, too?\" inquired the Boy, turning to the silent one  who had thrown the axe at him. The fellow glared at him defiantly for  a moment, then glanced at his wounded arm, which hung limp at his  side. At last he answered with a sullen growl:    \"Yes, I'll swear! Got to! Curse you!\"    \"Good!\" said the Boy. \"That's the best way for all of us. Jabe, will  you take their oaths. You know how better than I do!\"    \"All right!\" responded the latter, shrugging his shoulders in a way  which said--\"it's your idee, not mine!\" Then he proceeded to bind each  man separately by an oath which left no loophole, and which was sealed  by all that their souls held sacred. This done, he handed back the  rifles,--and the two poachers, without a word, turned their backs and  made off at a swift lope straight up the open pond. The Boy and Jabe  watched them till they vanished among the trees. Then, with a shy  little laugh, the Boy picked up the axe which had been hurled at his  head.    \"I'm glad he left me this,\" he murmured, \"to kind of remember him  by!\"    \"The sneakin' skunk!\" growled Jabe. \"If I'd had my way, it'd be the  penitentiary for the both of 'em!\"    That evening, when the whole story was told, the woodsmen were  indignant, for a time, because the half-breeds had been let go; but at  last they gave heed to Jabe's representations, and acknowledged that  the Boy's plan had saved a \"sight of bother.\" To guard against future  difficulties, however, they took a big piece of smooth board, and  painted the following sign, to be nailed up on a conspicuous tree  beside the pond.                                     NOTICE                     THIS IS BOY'S POND. NO TRAPPING HERE.                 IF ANYBODY WANTS TO SAY, WHY NOT? LAWLER'S                          CAMP WILL LET HIM KNOW.          THE WHITE-SLASHED BULL      HER back crushed beneath the massive weight of a \"deadfall,\" the  mother moose lay slowly sobbing her life out on the sweet spring air.  The villainous log, weighted cunningly with rocks, had caught her just  above the withers, bearing her forward so that her forelegs were  doubled under her, and her neck outstretched so that she could not  lift her muzzle from the wet moss. Though her eyes were already  glazing, and her nostrils full of a blown and blood-streaked froth,  from time to time she would struggle desperately to raise her head,  for she yearned to lick the sprawling, wobbling legs of the ungainly  calf which stood close beside her, bewildered because she would not  rise and suckle him.    The dying animal lay in the middle of the trail, which was an old,  half-obliterated "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#11)"],[1,"elow. They  are called \"black haglets\" by the fishermen, whose vessels they follow  in the hope of procuring bits of refuse. They commonly nest in burrows  in the ground, but are also said to build in fissures among the ledges.  Their single white egg measures 2.55 x 1.75. Data.--Island in Ungava  Bay, northern Labrador, June 14, 1896. Egg laid in a fissure of a sea  cliff. Collector, A. N. McFord.      95. DARK-BODIED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus griseus._    This is a southern species which, after having nested on islands in the  far south during our winter, comes north and appears off the Pacific  coast of the United States during the summer. It is a similar bird to  the Sooty Shearwater, but is considerably darker and the under coverts  are whitish. Their nesting habits are the same as those of other members  of the family. Size of egg, 2.40 x 1.65. Data.--Stewart's Island, New  Zealand, February 15, 1896. Single egg at the end of a long burrow.      96. SLENDER-BILLED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus tenuirostris._    Range.--Northern Pacific Ocean in the summer, extending from Japan and  Alaska southward. Supposed to breed in the southern hemisphere, as well  as probably on some of the Aleutians in Alaska.      96.1. WEDGE-TAILED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus cuneatus._    Range.--North Pacific, breeding on the Revillagigedo Islands off the  coast of Mexico, and probably on some of the small islands in the Gulf  of California.      97. BLACK-TAILED SHEARWATER. _Priofinus cinerus._    This is a Shearwater which inhabits the southern hemisphere, but which  has accidentally wandered to the Pacific coast of the United States. It  is dark above and whitish below, with black under tail coverts. It  breeds in the far south.    [Illustration 068: Sooty Shearwater.]  [Illustration: Dark-bodied Shearwater. Slender-billed Shearwater.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 67    98. BLACK-CAPPED PETREL. _AEstrelata hasitata._    This is not a common species; it is an inhabitant of tropical seas and  has only been casually found on our coasts or inland. It is a handsome  species with white forehead, underparts and nape with a small isolated  black cap on the crown; the rest of the upper parts are blackish. It is  a native of the West Indies.      99. SCALED PETREL. _AEstrelata scalaris._    This is another rare species which is an inhabitant of southern seas. A  single specimen taken in New York State gives it a claim as a doubtful  North American species. It is a handsome bird, the feathers of the  grayish upperparts being edged with white, thus giving it the appearance  of being barred. Its eggs have only been known to science within the  past few years. Data.--Preservation Inlet, New Zealand, June 7, 1900.  Single white egg. Size 2.40 x 1.75. Collector, P. Seymour. Parent bird  taken with the egg.      100. FISHER'S PETREL. _AEstralata fisheri._    This is a handsome bird known only from the type specimen taken off  Kadiak Is., Alaska, by Mr. Fisher.      101. BULWER'S PETREL. _Bulweria bulweri._    An eastern Atlantic species which is only an accidental visitant to our  shores. They breed on the Madeira Islands where the eggs are laid in  crevices among the rocks or in burrows in the ground. Size 1.75 x 1.55,  white.      102. PINTADO PETREL. _Daption capensis._    This is the Cape Pigeon of the southern hemisphere. It has only  accidentally occurred on our coast.    [Illustration 069: Black-capped Petrel. Scaled Petrel. Fisher's  Petrel.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 68    103. LEAST PETREL. _Halocyptena microsoma._    Range.--Pacific coast of America from Lower California to Panama. The  Least Petrel is the smallest of this family, in length measuring only  5.75 inches. Their plumage is entirely dark sooty. They have been found  breeding on San Benito Island, Lower California, and they probably do on  others farther south. The single egg that this bird lays is white with a  wreath of fine black specks around one and sometimes both ends.  Data.--San Benito Is., Lower California, June 12, 1897. No nest, the egg  being simply laid on the bare rock in a crevice. Size 1.00 x .75.  Collector, A. W. Anthony.      104. STORM PETREL. _Thalassidroma pelagica._    North Atlantic Ocean chiefly on the European side, wintering south to  New Brunswick. Smallest of the white rumped, black petrels; 5.75 inches  in length.    This species is the originally called \"Mother Cary's Chicken\" by the  sailors. They nest abundantly on many of the islands off the coasts of  Europe and the British Isles, laying their single egg either in burrows  or crevices among the cliffs. Data.--Coast of County Kerry, Ireland,  June 1, 1895. Single egg laid at the end of burrow in a sea cliff. Size  1.05 x .80; white with a wreath of very fine dots about the larger end.  Collector, G. H. McDonald.      105. FORKED-TAILED PETREL. _Oceanodroma furcata._    Range.--North Pacific from California to Alaska, breeding in the  Aleutians.    These birds have a plumage of bluish gray, the wings being darker and  the underparts lightest. The nests are made in burrows or crevices in  the banks. Data.--Uniak Is., Alaska, June 10, 1900. No nest. Single egg  laid at the end of a burrow. Several pairs nesting near. Egg white with  a fine wreath of purplish black specks about the large end. Size 1.25 x  .95.    [Illustration 070: White.]  [Illustration: Least Petrel. Stormy Petrel. Forked-tailed Petrel.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 69    105.2. KAEDING'S PETREL. _Oceanodroma kaedingi._    This bird is similar to Leach Petrel, but is smaller and the tail is  less deeply forked. Its range is from California to Panama breeding on  the Revillagigedo Islands off Mexico.      106. LEACH'S PETREL. _Oceanodroma leucorhoa._    Range.--North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, breeding from Maine and  from the Farallones, northward to Greenland and the Aleutians.    These are the most common of the Petrels found on our coast; they are  eight inches in length, of a sooty brown color, and have a white rump.  The forked tail will at once distinguish them from any of the Atlantic  Petrels. They nest in burrows in the ground, laying a pure white egg,  sometimes with a very faint dusty wreath about the larger end. Size 1.20  x .95. These birds generally take turns in the task of incubation, one  remaining at sea during the day and returning at night while his mate  takes her turn roving the briny deep in search of food. The young are  fed by regurgitation upon an oily fluid which has a very offensive odor.  This odor is always noticeable about an island inhabited by Petrels and  is always retained by the eggs or skins of these birds. They are very  rarely seen flying in the vicinity of their nesting island during the  day; the bird that is on the nest will remain until removed by hand.  Data.--Pumpkin Is., Maine, June 22, 1893. Single egg; nest of a few  grasses at the end of a burrow dug in the bank. Collector, J. Lefavour.      106.1 GUADALUPE PETREL. _Oceanodroma macrodactyla._    This species, which is very similar to the preceding, except for a  longer and more deeply forked tail, breeds on Guadalupe Is. Their eggs  are white very minutely wreathed with reddish brown; they are, however,  nearly always nest stained to an uneven brownish color. Data.--Guadalupe  Is., Lower California, March 24, 1897. Single egg laid on a few oak  leaves and pine needles at the end of a three foot burrow. Size of egg  1.40 x 1.00. Collector, A. W. Anthony.    [Illustration 071: White.]  [Illustration: Kaeding's Petrel. Leach's Petrel. Guadalupe Petrel.]  [Illustration: White, nest stained.]  [Illustration: right hand border.]    Page 70    107. BLACK PETREL. _Oceanodroma melania._    Range.--South Pacific, from southern California southward, breeding on  the small islands on both coasts of Lower California. They are similar  to the Leach's Petrel except that the rump is blackish. Data.--San  Benito Is., Lower California, July 23, 1896. White egg laid on bare  ground at the end of three foot burrow. Size 1.40 x 1. Collector, A. W.  Anthony.    108. ASHY PETREL. _Oceanodroma homochroa._    Range.--California coast, breeding on the Farallones and Santa Barbara  Islands.    This species, while not common, nests in all manner of localities on the  Farallones, concealing their eggs under any rock or in any crevice that  may attract their fancy. Their single white egg is only faintly if at  all wreathed with fine dust-like specks of reddish brown. Size 1.15 x  .86. Data.--Farallone Is., California, June 12, 1895. Egg laid on sand  in crevice at the base of a stone wall; well concealed. Collector,  Chester Barlow.      108.1. SOCORRO PETREL. _Oceanodroma socorroensis._    Breeds on Socorro, San Benito and Coronado Islands, placing its eggs at  the end of burrow. Data.--San Benito Is., Lower California, July 12,  1897. Single egg at the end of a burrow 3 feet in length. Egg pure white  very finely wreathed with pale reddish brown. Size 1.15 x .87.  Collector, A. W. Anthony.    [Illustration 072: Black Petrel. Ashy Petrel.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 71    109. WILSON'S PETREL. _Oceanites oceanicus._    Breeds in the southern hemisphere in February and March and spends the  summer off the Atlantic coast as far north as Newfoundland. This species  can be distinguished from Leach Petrel by its square tail and from the  Stormy Petrel by its large size and yellow webs to its feet. These birds  are the greatest wanderers of the genus, being found at different  seasons in nearly all quarters of the globe. Their single egg is white.  Size 1.25 x .90.      110. WHITE-BELLIED PETREL. _Fregetta grallaria._    A small species (length about 7.5 inches) inhabiting southern seas.  Recorded once at Florida. General plumage blackish. Upper tail coverts,  bases of tail feathers, under wing coverts, and abdomen, white.      111. WHITE-FACED PETREL."]]]
