He regards me  unsuspiciously, or avoids me with a noble reserve--or, if I am quiet and  incurious, graciously hops toward me, as if to pay his respects, or to  make my acquaintance. I have passed under his nest within a few feet of  his mate and brood, when he sat near by on a branch eying me sharply,  but without opening his beak; but the moment I raised my hand toward his  defenseless household his anger and indignation were beautiful to  behold.    What a noble pride he has! Late one October, after his mates and  companions had long since gone South, I noticed one for several  successive days in the dense part of this next-door wood, flitting  noiselessly about, very grave and silent, as if doing penance for some  violation of the code of honor. By many gentle, indirect approaches, I  perceived that part of his tail-feathers were undeveloped. The sylvan  prince could not think of returning to court in this plight, and so,  amid the falling leaves and cold rains of autumn, was patiently biding  his time.    [Illustration: WOOD THRUSH]    It is a curious habit the wood thrush has of starting its nest with a  fragment of newspaper or other paper. Except in remote woods, I think it  nearly always puts a piece of paper in the foundation of its nest. Last  spring I chanced to be sitting near a tree in which a wood thrush had  concluded to build. She came with a piece of paper nearly as large as my  hand, placed it upon the branch, stood upon it a moment, and then flew  down to the ground. A little puff of wind caused the paper to leave the  branch a moment afterward. The thrush watched it eddy slowly down to the  ground, when she seized it and carried it back. She placed it in  position as before, stood upon it again for a moment, and then flew  away. Again the paper left the branch, and sailed away slowly to the  ground. The bird seized it again, jerking it about rather spitefully, I  thought; she turned it round two or three times, then labored back to  the branch with it, upon which she shifted it about as if to hit upon  some position in which it would lie more securely. This time she sat  down upon it for a moment, and then went away, doubtless with the  thought in her head that she would bring something to hold it down. The  perverse paper followed her in a few seconds. She seized it again, and  hustled it about more than before. As she rose with it toward the nest,  it in some way impeded her flight, and she was compelled to return to  the ground with it. But she kept her temper remarkably well. She turned  the paper over and took it up in her beak several times before she was  satisfied with her hold, and then carried it back to the branch, where,  however, it would not stay. I saw her make six trials of it, when I was  called away. I think she finally abandoned the restless fragment,  probably a scrap that held some \"breezy\" piece of writing, for later in  the season I examined the nest and found no paper in it.    How completely the life of a bird revolves about its nest, its home! In  the case of the wood thrush, its life and joy seem to mount higher and  higher as the nest prospers. The male becomes a fountain of melody; his  happiness waxes day by day; he makes little triumphal tours about the  neighborhood, and pours out his pride and gladness in the ears of all.  How sweet, how well-bred, is his demonstration! But let any accident  befall that precious nest, and what a sudden silence falls upon him!  Last summer a pair of wood thrushes built their nest within a few rods  of my house, and when the enterprise was fairly launched and the mother  bird was sitting upon her four blue eggs, the male was in the height of  his song. How he poured forth his rich melody, never in the immediate  vicinity of the nest, but always within easy hearing distance! Every  morning, as promptly as the morning came, between five and six, he would  sing for half an hour from the top of a locust-tree that shaded my  roof. I came to expect him as much as I expected my breakfast, and I was  not disappointed till one morning I seemed to miss something. What was  it? Oh, the thrush had not sung this morning. Something is the matter;  and, recollecting that yesterday I had seen a red squirrel in the trees  not far from the nest, I at once inferred that the nest had been  harried. Going to the spot, I found my fears were well grounded; every  egg was gone. The joy of the thrush was laid low. No more songs from the  tree-top, and no more songs from any point, till nearly a week had  elapsed, when I heard him again under the hill, where the pair had  started a new nest, cautiously tuning up, and apparently with his recent  bitter experience still weighing upon him.    There is no nest-builder that suffers more from crows and squirrels and  other enemies than the wood thrush. It builds as openly and  unsuspiciously as if it thought all the world as honest as itself. Its  favorite place is the fork of a sapling, eight or ten feet from the  ground, where it falls an easy prey to every nest-robber that comes  prowling through the woods and groves. It is not a bird that skulks and  hides, like the catbird, the brown thrasher, the chat, or the chewink,  and its nest is not concealed with the same art as theirs. Our thrushes  are all frank, open-mannered birds; but the veery and the hermit build  on the ground, where they may at least escape the crows, owls, and jays,  and stand a good chance of being overlooked by the red squirrel and  weasel also; while the robin seeks the protection of dwellings and  outbuildings. For years I have not known the nest of a wood thrush to  succeed. During the season referred to I observed but two, both  apparently a second attempt, as the season was well advanced, and both  failures. In one case, the nest was placed in a branch that an  apple-tree, standing near a dwelling, held out over the highway. The  structure was barely ten feet above the middle of the road, and would  just escape a passing load of hay. It was made conspicuous by the use of  a large fragment of newspaper in its foundation,--an unsafe material to  build upon in most cases. Whatever else the press may guard, this  particular newspaper did not guard this nest from harm. It saw the egg  and probably the chick, but not the fledgeling. A murderous deed was  committed above the public highway, but whether in the open day or under  cover of darkness I have no means of knowing. The frisky red squirrel  was doubtless the culprit. The other nest was in a maple sapling, within  a few yards of the little rustic summer-house already referred to. The  first attempt of the season, I suspect, had failed in a more secluded  place under the hill; so the pair had come up nearer the house for  protection. The male sang in the trees near by for several days before I  chanced to see the nest. The very morning, I think, it was finished, I  saw a red squirrel exploring a tree but a few yards away; he probably  knew what the singing meant as well as I did. I did not see the inside  of the nest, for it was almost instantly deserted, the female having  probably laid a single egg, which the squirrel had devoured.    One evening, while seated upon my porch, I had convincing proof that  musical or song contests do take place among the birds. Two wood  thrushes who had nests near by sat on the top of a dead tree and pitted  themselves against each other in song for over half an hour, contending  like champions in a game, and certainly affording the rarest treat in  wood-thrush melody I had ever had. They sang and sang with unwearied  spirit and persistence, now and then changing position or facing in  another direction, but keeping within a few feet of each other. The  rivalry became so obvious and was so interesting that I finally made it  a point not to take my eyes from the singers. The twilight deepened till  their forms began to grow dim; then one of the birds could stand the  strain no longer, the limit of fair competition had been reached, and  seeming to say, \"I will silence you, anyhow,\" it made a spiteful dive at  its rival, and in hot pursuit the two disappeared in the bushes beneath  the tree.          THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE      The nest of nests, the ideal nest, is unquestionably that of the  Baltimore oriole. It is the only perfectly pensile nest we have. The  nest of the orchard oriole is indeed mainly so, but this bird generally  builds lower and shallower, more after the manner of the vireos.    The Baltimore oriole loves to attach its nest to the swaying branches of  the tallest elms, making no attempt at concealment, but satisfied if the  position be high and the branch pendent. This nest would seem to cost  more time and skill than any other bird structure. A peculiar flax-like  material seems to be always sought after and always found. The nest when  completed assumes the form of a large, suspended gourd. The walls are  thin but firm, and proof against the most driving rain. The mouth is  hemmed or over-handed with strings or horsehair, and the sides are  usually sewed through and through with the same.    Not particular as to the matter of secrecy, the bird is not particular  as to material, so that it be of the nature of strings or threads. A  lady friend once told me that, while she was working by an open window,  one of these birds approached while her back was turned, and, seizing a  skein of some kind of thread or yarn, made off with it to its  half-finished nest. But the perverse yarn caught fast in the branches,  and, in the bird's efforts to extricate it, got hopelessly tangled. She  tugged away at it all day, but was finally obliged to content herself  with a few detached portions. The fluttering strings were an eyesore to  her ever after, and, passing and repassing, she would give them a  spiteful jerk, as much as to say, \"There is that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#11)"],[1,"angle, scarcely  exceeding the angle of repose, a slope of soft, loose snow, and the very  top of that slope where it actually joined the wall of ice offered the  only possible passage. The wall was in the main perpendicular, and  turned at a right angle midway. Just where it turned, a great mass  bulged out and overhung. This traverse was so long that with both ropes  joined it was still necessary for three of the four members of the party  to be on the snow slope at once, two men out of sight of the others. Any  one familiar with Alpine work will realize immediately the great danger  of such a traverse. There was, however, no avoiding it, or, at whatever  cost, we should have done so. Twice already the passage had been made by  Karstens and Walter, but not with heavy packs, and one man was always on  ice while the other was on snow. This time all four must pass, bearing  all that men could bear. Cautiously the first man ventured out, setting  foot exactly where foot had been set before, the three others solidly  anchored on the ice, paying out the rope and keeping it taut. When all  the first section of rope was gone, the second man started, and when, in  turn, his rope was paid out, the third man started, leaving the last man  on the ice holding to the rope. This, of course, was the most dangerous  part of this passage. If one of the three had slipped it would have been  almost impossible for the others to hold him, and if he had pulled the  others down, it would have been quite impossible for the solitary man on  the ice to have withstood the strain. When the first man reached solid  ice again there was another equally dangerous minute or two, for then  all three behind him were on the snow slope. The beetling cliff, where  the trail turned at right angles, was the acutely dangerous spot. With  heavy and bulky packs it was exceedingly difficult to squeeze past this  projection. Ice gives no such entrance to the point of the axe as hard  snow does, yet the only aid in steadying the climber, and in somewhat  relieving his weight on the loose snow, was afforded by such purchase  upon the ice-wall, shoulder high, as that point could effect. Not a word  was spoken by any one; all along the ice-wall rang in the writer's ears  that preposterous line from \"The Hunting of the Snark\"--\"Silence, not  even a shriek!\" It was with a deep and thankful relief that we found  ourselves safely across, and when a few minutes later we had climbed the  steep snow that lay against the cleavage wall and were at last upon the  smooth, unbroken crest of the ridge, we realized that probably the worst  place in the entire climb was behind us.    Steep to the very limit of climbability as that ridge was, it was the  easiest going we had had since we left the glacier floor. The steps were  already cut; it was only necessary to lift one foot after the other and  set the toe well in the hole, with the ice-axe buried afresh in the snow  above at every step. But each step meant the lifting not only of oneself  but of one's load, and the increasing altitude, perhaps aggravated by  the dense vapor with which the air was charged, made the advance  exceedingly fatiguing. From below, the foreshortened ridge seemed only  of short length and of moderate grade, could we but reach it--a  tantalizingly easy passage to the upper glacier it looked as we chopped  our way, little by little, nearer and nearer to it. But once upon it, it  lengthened out endlessly, the sky-line always just a little above us,  but never getting any closer.    [Sidenote: The Cock's Comb]    Just before reaching the steepest pitch of the ridge, where it sweeps up  in a cock's comb,[3] we came upon the vestiges of a camp made by our  predecessors of a year before, in a hollow dug in the snow--an empty  biscuit carton and a raisin package, some trash and brown paper and  discolored snow--as fresh as though they had been left yesterday instead  of a year ago. Truly the terrific storms of this region are like the  storms of Guy Wetmore Carryl's clever rhyme that \"come early and avoid  the _rush_.\" They will sweep a man off his feet, as once threatened to  our advance party, but will pass harmlessly over a cigarette stump and a  cardboard box; our tent in the glacier basin, ramparted by a wall of  ice-blocks as high as itself, we found overwhelmed and prostrate upon  our return, but the willow shoots with which we had staked our trail  upon the glacier were all standing.    Long as it was, the slope was ended at last, and we came straight to the  great upstanding granite slabs amongst which is the natural  camping-place in the pass that gives access to the Grand Basin. We named  that pass the Parker Pass, and the rock tower of the ridge that rises  immediately above it, the most conspicuous feature of this region from  below, we named the Browne Tower. The Parker-Browne party was the first  to camp at this spot, for the astonishing \"sourdough\" pioneers made no  camp at all above the low saddle of the ridge (as it then existed), but  took all the way to the summit of the North Peak in one gigantic stride.  The names of Parker and Browne should surely be permanently associated  with this mountain they were so nearly successful in climbing, and we  found no better places to name for them.    There is only one difficulty about the naming of this pass; strictly  speaking, it is not a pass at all, and the writer does not know of any  mountaineering term that technically describes it. Yet it should bear a  name, for it is the doorway to the upper glacier, through which all  those who would reach the summit must enter. On the one hand rises the  Browne Tower, with the Northeast Ridge sweeping away beyond it toward  the South Peak. On the other hand, the ice of the upper glacier plunges  to its fall. The upstanding blocks of granite on a little level shoulder  of the ridge lead around to the base of the cliffs of the Northeast  Ridge, and it is around the base of those cliffs that the way lies to  the midst of the Grand Basin. So the Parker Pass we call it and desire  that it should be named.    [Illustration: The Upper Basin reached at last. Our camp at the Parker  Pass at 15,000 feet.]    [Sidenote: Karstens Ridge]    And while names are before us, the writer would ask permission to bestow  another. Having nothing to his credit in the matter at all, as the  narrative has already indicated, he feels free to say that in his  opinion the conquest of the difficulties of the earthquake-shattered  ridge was an exploit that called for high qualities of judgment and  cautious daring, and would, he thinks, be considered a brilliant piece  of mountaineering anywhere in the world. He would like to name that  ridge Karstens Ridge, in honor of the man who, with Walter's help, cut  that staircase three miles long amid the perilous complexities of its  chaotic ice-blocks.    When we reached the Parker Pass all the world beneath us was shrouded in  dense mist, but all above us was bathed in bright sunshine. The great  slabs of granite were like a gateway through which the Grand Basin  opened to our view.    The ice of the upper glacier, which fills the Grand Basin, came  terracing down from some four thousand feet above us and six miles  beyond us, with progressive leaps of jagged blue serac between the two  peaks of the mountain, and, almost at our feet, fell away with cataract  curve to its precipitation four thousand feet below us. Across the  glacier were the sheer, dark cliffs of the North Peak, soaring to an  almost immediate summit twenty thousand feet above the sea; on the left,  in the distance, was just visible the receding snow dome of the South  Peak, with its two horns some five hundred feet higher. The mists were  passing from the distant summits, curtain after curtain of gauze draping  their heads for a moment and sweeping on.    We made our camp between the granite slabs on the natural camping site  that offered itself, and a shovel and an empty alcohol-can proclaimed  that our predecessors of last year had done the same.    The next morning the weather had almost completely cleared, and the view  below us burst upon our eyes as we came out of the tent into the still  air.    [Sidenote: Parker Pass]    The Parker Pass is the most splendid coigne of vantage on the whole  mountain, except the summit itself. From an elevation of something more  than fifteen thousand feet one overlooks the whole Alaskan range, and  the scope of view to the east, to the northeast, and to the southeast is  uninterrupted. Mountain range rises beyond mountain range, until only  the snowy summits are visible in the great distance, and one knows that  beyond the last of them lies the open sea. The near-by peaks and ridges,  red with granite or black with shale and gullied from top to bottom with  snow and ice, the broad highways of the glaciers at their feet carrying  parallel moraines that look like giant tram-lines, stand out with vivid  distinction. A lofty peak, that we suppose is Mount Hunter, towers above  the lesser summits. The two arms of the Muldrow Glacier start right in  the foreground and reveal themselves from their heads to their junction  and then to the terminal snout, receiving their groaning tributaries  from every evacuating height. The dim blue lowlands, now devoid of snow,  stretch away to the northeast, with threads of stream and patches of  lake that still carry ice along their banks.    And all this splendor and diversity yielded itself up to us at once;  that was the most sensational and spectacular feature of it. We went to  sleep in a smother of mist; we had seen nothing as we climbed; we rose  to a clear, sparkling day. The clouds were mysteriously rolling away  from the lowest depths; the last wisps of vapor were sweeping over the  ultimate heights. Here one would like to camp through a whole week of  fine weather could such a week ever be counted upon. Higher than any  point in"]]]
