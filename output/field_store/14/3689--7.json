The present taxonomic position of _Spiza_ in the Richmondeninae,  which has been questioned by Beecher (1951a:431; 1953:309), is  corroborated at least insofar as the serological evidence is  concerned. Certainly, serological correspondence of _Spiza_ with the  richmondenine-emberizine-thraupid assemblage is greater than with any  other group of birds tested.    It is obvious that the serological affinities of the carduelines do  not lie with the richmondenines, emberizines, or thraupids. The  carduelines show greater serological correspondence with the  estrildines than they do with any of the other groups tested. Further  serological investigation involving other species, however, is  necessary before the nearest relatives of the carduelines can be  determined with certainty.    The two estrildines tested (_Estrilda_ and _Poephila_) show close  serological relationship. Their nearest relatives, serologically, seem  to be the carduelines. The classification (Wetmore, 1951) that places  _Passer_ in the same family with the estrildines is not upheld by the  serological data available. _Passer_ is not, serologically, closely  related to any of the birds tested. It is of interest that Beecher  (1953:303-305), on the basis of jaw musculature, places _Passer_ and  the estrildines in separate families (Ploceidae and Estrildidae,  respectively).    _Molothrus_ shows greater serological correspondence to the  richmondenine-emberizine-thraupid assemblage than to any of the other  birds tested. It is definitely set apart from this group, however, and  its position, serologically, is compatible with that based on evidence  from other sources.    There seems to be but little argument among ornithologists that  icterids, fringillids, and ploceids constitute families which are  distinct from one another. If, then, the serological differences  between _Molothrus_ (Icteridae) and _Richmondena_ (Fringillidae),  between _Molothrus_ and _Zonotrichia_ (Fringillidae), and between  _Richmondena_ and _Poephila_ (Ploceidae) are indicative of family  differences, there are four families represented by the birds  involved. _Molothrus_ represents one family; _Piranga_, _Richmondena_,  _Spiza_, _Junco_, and _Zonotrichia_, a second; _Estrilda_, _Poephila_,  _Carpodacus_, and _Spinus_, a third; and _Passer_, a fourth.          CONCLUSIONS      The heterogeneity of the Family Fringillidae has been emphasized by  many authors. The relationships of the species now included in this  Family have been the subject of much discussion and constitute an  important problem in avian systematics.    Sushkin's studies (1924, 1925) of features of the horny and bony  palates have served as a basis for the present division of the Family  into subfamilies. Recently, Beecher (1951a, 1951b, 1953) and Tordoff  (1954) have used these features and others which they thought to be of  value in an attempt to clarify the relationships of the species  involved.    Beecher's work (1951a, 1951b, 1953) on jaw-musculature is a valuable  contribution to our knowledge of the anatomy of passerine birds. His  myological studies were so thorough and his presentation so detailed  that students who disagree with his interpretations can draw their own  conclusions. Beecher (1951b:276) points out that there are two basic  types of skeletal muscle--those with parallel fibers and those with  pinnately arranged fibers. The muscles with pinnate fibers seem to be  more efficient, each muscle having a greater functional cross section  for its bulk than does one with parallel fibers. He assumes that  muscles with parallel fibers are more primitive, phylogenetically,  than are those with fibers arranged pinnately. Since his study of the  jaw muscles of the Icteridae (1951a) revealed that patterns of  jaw-musculature within this Family remain constant regardless of the  methods used in procuring food, he assumes that such patterns may be  used as indicators of relationship throughout the entire oscinine  group. These two assumptions, then, serve as the basis for his  hypothesis concerning relationship and phylogeny within this  assemblage. Beecher (1951b:278-280; 1953:310-312) maintains that  within the Family Thraupidae there are two main lines which lead with  almost no disjunction to the Carduelinae and Richmondeninae. The  thraupid-richmondenine line involves a shift in the nature of the _m.  adductor mandibulae externus superficialis_, which becomes more  pinnate in the richmondenines. This results in greater crushing power.  The thraupid-cardueline line involves a shift in emphasis from the the  _m. adductor mandibulae externus medialis_ to the _m. pseudotemporalis  superficialis_ and the forward advance of the insertion of the latter.  This, also, promotes greater crushing ability. He states that features  of the horny palate and of the plumage provide further evidence of  close relationship of these groups. He includes, therefore, the  Thraupinae, the Carduelinae, and the Pyrrhuloxiinae (=Richmondeninae)  in the Family Thraupidae. Beecher (1953:307) indicates that the  patterns of jaw-musculature of the Parulinae (wood warblers) and  Emberizinae (buntings) are similar and suggests that the buntings had  their origin from the wood warblers. He includes these subfamilies,  therefore, in the Family Parulidae.    Beecher's reasoning may be criticized on several points. It may be, as  he suggests, that muscles with parallel fibers evolved earlier,  phylogenetically, than did muscles with pinnate fibers, but he does  not give adequate consideration, it seems to me, to the possibility  that parallel fibers may also have evolved secondarily from pinnate  fibers. Since Beecher (1951a) found that patterns of jaw-musculature  within the Family Icteridae were conservative, he is reluctant to  admit the possibility of convergence among any of the other families.  Differences in patterns of jaw-musculature are, however, functional  adaptations and like the bill, which is also associated with  food-getting may be subject to rapid evolutionary change. Finally, in  attempting to classify the oscines, he has relied almost entirely on a  single character--the pattern of jaw-musculature.    Tordoff's attempts (1954) to clarify the relationships of the  fringillids and related species are based chiefly on features of the  bony palate. He assumes that since palato-maxillaries seem to be  absent in the majority of passerine birds, their occurrence in certain  nine-primaried oscine groups indicates relationship among these  groups. He points out that these bones, when present, are important  areas of origin of the _m. pterygoideus_ which functions in depression  of the upper jaw and in elevation of the lower jaw. He assumes,  therefore, that palato-maxillaries were evolved to provide for a more  effective action of the _m. pterygoideus_. The need for such action  could be associated with a seed-eating habit. All richmondenines and  emberizines possess palato-maxillary bones either free or fused to the  prepalatine bar, but there is no trace of these bones in the  carduelines. Carduelines, furthermore, possess prepalatine bars that  are characteristically flared anteriorly. This condition does not  exist in the richmondenines or in the emberizines.    Tordoff points out, also, that the irregular, erratic migrations of  the New World Carduelinae are unlike the more regular migrations of  the richmondenines and emberizines. The carduelines, furthermore, are  more arboreal in their habits than are these other groups and exhibit  a decided lack of nest sanitation during the later stages of nesting,  a situation which contrasts with that found in the Richmondeninae and  Emberizinae. He suggests, therefore, that the carduelines are not so  closely related to the richmondenines and the emberizines as  previously has been thought.    Since there are only two cardueline genera, _Loximitris_ and  _Hesperiphona_, endemic to the New World and at least 10 genera with  many species endemic to the Old World, Tordoff (1954:15) suggests an  Old World origin for the carduelines. He strengthens his argument for  this hypothesis by pointing out that in features of the bony palate  and in habits the carduelines resemble the estrildines of the Family  Ploceidae.    Tordoff (1954:29-30) states that the tanagers not only merge with the  richmondenines but also grade imperceptibly into the emberizines. He  includes, therefore, the Richmondeninae, Emberizinae, and Thraupinae  in the Family Fringillidae. He suggests that the carduelines are  ploceids, closely related to the Subfamily Estrildinae, on the basis  of structure of the bony palate, geographic distribution, social  behavior, and habits such as nest-fouling and nest-building.    Tordoff, like Beecher, has based his interpretations chiefly on one  feature--structure of the bony palate. Since this feature also is  associated with food-getting, the possibilities of convergence of  distantly related species with similar habits and divergence of  closely related species with different habits may not be excluded.    The hazard of unrecognized adaptive convergence cannot, of course, be  excluded from most fields of taxonomic research, but some features of  morphology and biochemistry are notably more conservative than others  and undergo slower evolutionary change. Such features are often of  utmost importance in distinguishing the higher taxonomic categories.    Most ornithologists are aware that, within the Order Passeriformes,  patterns of musculature in the leg have evolved at a slow rate and  exhibit little variation within the Order. Differences which do occur,  therefore, probably are significant, especially those that are  consistent between groups of species. As I have pointed out earlier  (p. 184), there are no significant differences in leg-musculature  between the Richmondeninae, Emberizinae, and Thraupidae. Indeed, it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33941"],[0,"The Methods of Glass Blowing and of Working Silica in the Oxy-Gas Flame (#11)"],[1,"actice, but to make a tolerably presentable piece  of apparatus in which the two limbs are bent round till they are  parallel, without any considerable constriction at the bend, can be  accomplished without much difficulty.[11]    [11] Large tubes may also be bent by rotating a sufficient length of the  tube in a large flame till it softens, and bending in the same manner as  in the case of smaller tubes, and after filling them with sand, closing  one end completely, and the other so that the sand cannot escape, though  heated air can do so.      =Spiral Tubes.=--These may be made by twisting a tube gradually softened  by heat round a metal cylinder. Spiral tubes made of small thin tubes  possess considerable elasticity, and have been used by Mr. Crookes for  making air-tight connections between separate pieces of apparatus when a  rigid connection would have been unnecessary and inconvenient. By the  use of such spiral tubes it is possible to combine comparatively free  movement with all the advantages attached to hermetically-sealed joints.    To make a flexible spiral tube, mount a copper cylinder on a screw, so  that the cylinder will travel in the direction of its axis when it is  rotated. Fix a fine glass tube to the cylinder, and direct a flame  towards the cylinder so as to heat and soften the glass, which will then  bend to the form of the cylinder. Gradually rotate the cylinder before  the source of heat, so that fresh portions of tube are successively  brought into position, softened, and bent. Useful spirals may also be  made by hand without a cylinder. As each length of tube is bent, a fresh  length may be united to it until the spiral is completed. The fine tubes  employed are prepared by heating and drawing out larger tubes.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]      =Thistle Funnels= (Fig. 25).--Seal a moderately thick piece of small  glass tube at _A_, then heat a wide zone of it a little below _A_ by  rotating it horizontally in the blow-pipe flame till the glass softens,  and expand the glass to a bulb, as shown at _B_ of 1; during the  operation of blowing this bulb, the end _A_ must be directed to the  ground.    Soften the end _A_ and a small portion of _B_ as before, and, holding  the tube horizontally from the mouth, blow out the end _C_ as at 2. Heat  the end of _C_ gradually, till the glass softens and collapses to the  dotted line _dd_, and at once blow a steady stream of air into the open  end of the tube, rotating it steadily, till it is about to burst;  finally clean off the thin glass from round the edges of the funnel,  which should have the form shown at 3, and round them. An inspection of  a purchased thistle funnel will generally show that the head _B_ has  been formed from a larger tube sealed to _E_ at _f_.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]      =Closing Tubes containing Chemicals= for experiments at high  temperatures.--Tubes of the hard glass used for organic analyses answer  best for this purpose; the operation of drawing out the end of such a  tube is practically identical with what has been described under the  head of choking, p. 35. A well-sealed tube presents the appearance of  that shown by Fig. 26.    In order to secure a thick end to the point of the tube _a_, about an  inch or so of the tube near the contracted part should be warmed a  little, if it is not already warm, at the moment of finally sealing it;  the contraction of the air in the tube, in consequence of the cooling of  the warm tube, will then ensure the glass at _a_ running together to a  solid end when it is melted in the flame.    If it will be necessary to collect a gas produced during a chemical  action from such a tube, make the contracted end several inches long,  and bend it into the form of a delivery tube. It will then be possible  to break the tip of this under a cylinder in a trough of liquid.      =In order to explain the construction of apparatus consisting of several  parts=, it will be sufficient to take as examples, two very well-known  instruments, and to describe their construction in detail. From what is  learned in studying these, the student will gather the information that  is wanted.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.]    1. _To make Hofman's Apparatus for the electrolysis of water_ (Fig. 27).    Take two tubes about 35 cm. in length, and 14 mm. in diameter for _AA_,  join taps _TT_ to the end _B_ of each of them, draw out the other end,  as shown at _D_, after sheets of platinum foil with wires attached to  them[12] have been introduced into the tubes, and moved by shaking to  _BB_. Then allow the platinum wires to pass through the opening _D_ left  for the purpose, and seal the glass at _D_ round the platinum as at _E_.  Pierce the tubes at _JJ_, and join them by a short piece of tube _K_,  about 14 mm. in diameter, to which the tube _T_, carrying the reservoir  _R_, has been previously united. _R_ may be made by blowing a bulb from  a larger piece of tube attached to the end of _T_. The mouth _M_ of the  reservoir being formed from the other end of the wide tube afterwards.  One of the taps can be used for blowing through at the later stages.  Each joint, especially those at _JJ_, must be annealed after it is  blown. Some operators might prefer to join _AA_ by the tube _K_ in the  first instance, then to introduce the electrodes at _E_ and _D_. In some  respects this plan would be rather easier than the other, but, on the  whole, it is better to make the joints at _JJ_ last in order, as they  are more apt to be broken than the others during the subsequent  manipulations.    [12] Red-hot platinum welds very well. The wire may be joined to the  sheet of foil by placing the latter on a small piece of fire-brick,  holding the wire in contact with it at the place where they are to be  united, directing a blow-pipe flame upon them till they are at an  intense heat, and smartly striking the wire with a hammer. The blow  should be several times repeated after re-heating the metal.    2. I have before me the vacuum tube shown by Fig. 28, in which the  dotted lines relate to details of manipulation only.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.]    It is usually possible to detect the parts of which a piece of apparatus  has been built up, for even the best-made joints exhibit evidence of  their existence. Thus, although I did not make the tube that is before  me, and cannot therefore pretend to say precisely in what order its  parts were made and put together, the evidence which it exhibits of  joints at the dotted lines _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, _E_, _F_, enables me to  give a general idea of the processes employed in its construction, and  to explain how a similar tube might be constructed. I should advise  proceeding as follows:--    Join a piece of tube somewhat larger than _M_ to its end _A_, draw out  the other end of the larger tube, and blow a bulb _L_ as directed on p.  47. Then seal the electrode _R_ into the bulb _L_ (p. 55).    Blow a similar but larger bulb _N_ from a large piece of tube sealed  between two tubes of similar size to _M_, as described at p. 50. Cut off  one of the tubes at _B_, and join the bulb _N_ to _M_ at _B_. Form the  bulb _Q_ in the same manner as in the case of _L_, seal into it the  electrode _R_, and add the tube marked by the dotted lines at _F_.    Seal a narrow tube _P_ to the end of a larger tube, and blow out the  tube at the joint till the glass is thin and regular. Take a tube _O_,  of similar size to _M_, slightly longer than _P_, contract its mouth  slightly to meet the wide end of _P_ at _D_, and after loosely  supporting _P_ inside _O_ with a cork, or otherwise, close the end _N_  of _O_ by sealing or corking it, and join _P_ to _O_ at _D_. Cut off _O_  just above _D_ at _E_, and join it to the bulb _Q_, closing either _O_  or _F_ for the purpose. Cut off the end of _O_ at _C_ parallel to the  end of _P_, and connect _O_ to _N_, using _F_ for blowing the joint at  _C_. _F_ may be used subsequently for introducing any gas into the tube,  and, when a vacuum has been established, may be sealed before the  blow-pipe.      [Illustration: FIG. 29.]    =Modes of combining the Parts of Heavy Apparatus.=--It is often  necessary to connect pieces of apparatus which are too heavy to be  freely handled before the blow-pipe, and which, therefore, cannot be  welded together as described on p. 39, by some more effective method  than the ordinary one of connecting by india-rubber tubing. For example,  apparatus which is to be exhausted by a Sprengel air-pump must be  attached to the pump by a joint as perfectly air-tight as can be  obtained. This, indeed, often may be done by welding the apparatus to be  exhausted to the air-pump before the blow-pipe. But such a method is  open to the obvious objection that it is very troublesome to connect and  disconnect the parts as often as may be necessary, and that there is  some risk of accidental breakages. Nevertheless it may be done on  occasion, especially if there be no objection to the use of the  flexible spiral tubes already alluded to. When the use of a spiral  connecting-tube is not admissible the difficulty is considerably  increased. For example, the author has lately required to attach an  ozone generator, of the form shown by Fig. 19, which previously had been  cemented into a heavy copper jacket, to a pressure-gauge rigidly fixed  to a support, and of considerable size. The employment of a flexible  spiral connection was prohibited by the fact that it was necessary that  the volume of the connecting-tube should be but a small fraction of that  of the ozone generator, a condition which compelled the use of a tube of  almost capillary bore, and of inconsiderable length. At the same time  the frailness of such a connection made it necessary to fix the  generator and pressure-gauge rigidly to their supports, in order to  avoid the possibility of breakage by slight accidental movements of  either of them, and it was obviously necessary to fix "]]]
