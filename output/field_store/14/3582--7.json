Of all the comic scenes connected with that  unseemly _fracas_, not the least laughable and characteristic was the  grand festival of reconciliation at Hatton House, when Lady Hatton  received the king and queen in Holborn, and expressly forbade her  husband to presume to show himself among her guests. \"The expectancy of  Sir Edward's rising,\" says a writer of the period,[6] \"is much abated by  reason of his lady's liberty,[7] who was brought in great honor to  Exeter House by my Lord of Buckingham from Sir William Craven's, whither  she had been remanded, presented by his lordship to the king, received  gracious usage, reconciled to her daughter by his Majesty, and her house  in Holborn enlightened by his presence at a dinner, where there was a  royal feast; and to make it more absolutely her own, express  commandment given by her ladyship, that neither Sir Edward Coke nor any  of his servants should be admitted.\"    If tradition may be credited, the law is greatly indebted to the class  of women whom it was our forefathers' barbarous wont to punish with the  ducking-stool. Had Coke been happy in his second marriage, it is assumed  that he would have spent more time in pleasure and fewer hours at his  desk, that the suitors in his court would have had less careful  decisions, and that posterity would have been favored with fewer  reports. If the inference is just, society may point to the commentary  on Littleton, and be thankful for the lady's unhappy temper and sharp  tongue. In like manner the wits of the following century maintained that  Holt's steady application to business was a consequence of domestic  misery. The lady who ruled his house in Bedford Row, is said to have  been such a virago, that the Chief Justice frequently retired to his  chambers, in order that he might place himself beyond reach of her  voice. Amongst the good stories told of Radcliffe, the Tory physician,  is the tradition of his boast, that he kept Lady Holt alive out of pure  political animosity to the Whig Chief Justice. Another eminent lawyer,  over whose troubles people have made merry in the same fashion, was  Jeffrey Gilbert, Baron of the Exchequer. At his death, October 14, 1726,  this learned judge left behind him that mass of reports, histories, and  treatises by which he is known as one of the most luminous, as well as  voluminous of legal writers. None of his works passed through the press  during his life, and when their number and value were discovered after  his departure to another world, it was whispered that they had been  composed in hours of banishment from a hearth where a _scolding wife_  made misery for all who came within the range of her querulous notes.    Disappointed in his suit to his beautiful and domineering cousin, Bacon  let some five or six years pass before he allowed his thoughts again to  turn to love, and then he wooed and waited for nearly three years more,  ere, on a bright May day, he met Alice Barnham in Marylebone Chapel, and  made her his wife in the presence of a courtly company. In the July of  1603, he wrote to Cecil:--\"For this divulged and almost prostituted  title of knighthood, I could, without charge by your honor's mean, be  content to have it, both because of this late disgrace, and because I  have three new knights in my mess in Gray's Inn Commons, and because I  have found out an alderman's daughter, a handsome maiden, to my liking.  So as if your honor will find the time, I will come to the court from  Gorhambury upon any warning.\" This expression, 'an alderman's daughter,'  contributed greatly, if it did not give rise to, the misapprehension  that Bacon's marriage was a mercenary arrangement. In these later times  the social status of an alderman is so much beneath the rank of a  distinguished member of the bar, that a successful queen's counsel, who  should make an offer to the daughter of a City magistrate, would be  regarded as bent upon a decidedly unambitious match; and if in a  significant tone he spoke of the lady as 'an alderman's daughter' his  words might be reasonably construed as a hint that her fortune atoned  for her want of rank. But it never occurred to Bacon's contemporaries to  put such a construction on the announcement. Far from using the words in  an apologetic manner, the lover meant them to express concisely that  Alice Barnham was a lady of suitable condition to bear a title as well  as to become his bride. Cecil regarded them merely as an assurance that  his relative meditated a suitable and even advantageous alliance, just  as any statesman of the present day would read an announcement that a  kinsman, making his way in the law-courts, intended to marry 'an  admiral's daughter' or a 'bishop's daughter.' That it was the reverse of  a mercenary marriage, Mr. Hepworth Dixon has indisputably proved in his  eighth chapter of 'The Story of Lord Bacon's Life,' where he contrasts  Lady Bacon's modest fortune with her husband's personal acquisitions and  prospects.    [4] To readers who have no sense of humor and irony, the essay 'Of Love'  unquestionably gives countenance to the theory that Francis Bacon was  cold and passionless in all that concerned woman. Of the many strange  constructions put upon this essay, not the least amusing and perverse is  that which would make it a piece of adroit flattery to Elizabeth, who  never permitted love \"to check with business,\" though she is represented  to have used it as a diversion in idle moments. If Sir Thomas More's  'Utopia' had been published a quarter of a century after 1518 (the date  of its appearance), a similar construction would have been put on the  passage, which urges that lovers should not be bound by an indissoluble  tie of wedlock, until mutual inspection has satisfied each of the  contracting parties that the other does not labor under any grave  personal defect. If it were possible to regard the passage containing  this proposal as an interpolation in the original romance, it might then  be regarded as an attempt to palliate Henry VIII.'s conduct to Anne of  Cleves.    [5] When due allowance has been made for the difference between the  usages of the sixteenth century and the present time, decency was  signally violated by this marriage, which followed so soon upon Mrs.  Coke's death, and still sooner upon the death of Lady Hatton's famous  grandfather, at whose funeral the lawyer made the first overtures for  her hand. Mrs. Coke died June 27, 1598, and was buried at Huntingfield,  co. Suffolk, July 24, 1598. Lord Burleigh expired on August 4, of the  same year. Coke's first marriage was not unhappy; and on the death of  his wife by that union, he wrote in his note-book:--\"Most beloved and  most excellent wife, she well and happily lived, and, as a true handmaid  of the Lord, fell asleep in the Lord, and now lives and reigns in  heaven.\" In after years he often wished most cordially that he could say  _as much_ for his second wife.    [6] Strafford's Letters and Despatches, I. 5.    [7] Lady Hatton never used her second husband's name either before or  after his knighthood. A good case, touching the customary right of a  married lady to bear the name, and take her title from the rank of a  former husband, is that of Sir Dudley North, Charles II.'s notorious  sheriff of London. The son of an English peer, he married Lady Gunning,  the widow of a wealthy civic knight, and daughter of Sir Robert Cann, \"a  morose old merchant of Bristol\"--the same magistrate whom Judge  Jeffreys, in terms not less just than emphatic, upbraided for his  connection with, or to speak moderately, his connivance at, the Bristol  kidnappers. It might be thought that the merchant's daughter, on her  marriage with a peer's son, would be well content to relinquish the  title of Lady Gunning; but Roger North tells us that his brother Dudley  accepted knighthood, in order that he might avoid giving offence to the  city, and also, in order that his wife might be called Lady North, and  not Lady Gunning.--_Vide Life of the Hon. Sir Dudley North._ After Sir  Thomas Wilde (subsequently Lord Truro), married Augusta Emma d'Este, the  daughter of the duke of Sussex and Lady Augusta Murray, that lady, of  whose legitimacy Sir Thomas had vainly endeavored to convince the House  of Lords, retained her maiden surname. In society she was generally  known as the Princess d'Este, and the bilious satirists of the Inns of  Court used to speak of Sir Thomas as 'the Prince.' It was said that one  of Wilde's familiar associates, soon after the lawyer's marriage, called  at his house and asked if the Princess d'Este was at home. \"No, sir,\"  replied the servant, \"the Princess d'Este is not at home, but the Prince  is!\" That this malicious story obtained a wide currency is not  wonderful; that it is a truthful anecdote the writer of this book would  not like to pledge his credit. The case of Sir John Campbell and Lady  Strathedon, was a notable instance of a lawyer and his wife bearing  different names. Raised to the peerage, with the title of Baroness  Stratheden, the first Lord Abinger's eldest daughter was indebted to her  husband for an honor that made him her social inferior. Many readers  will remember a droll story of a misapprehension caused by her  ladyship's title. During an official journey, Sir John Campbell and  Baroness Stratheden slept at lodgings which he had frequently occupied  as a circuiteer. On the morning after his arrival, the landlady obtained  a special interview with Campbell, and in the baroness's absence thus  addressed him, with mingled indignation and respectfulness:--\"Sir John  Campbell, I am a lone widow, and live by my good name.

You can see from these three  pictures partly how it happened. (20, 21, 22.)    Many of the other pictures were much too beautiful to begin with,  especially before lunch, but as they were drawn over and over again on  birch-bark, they became plainer and easier, till at last even Tegumai  said he could find no fault with them. They turned the hissy-snake the  other way round for the Z-sound, to show it was hissing backwards in a  soft and gentle way (23); and they just made a twiddle for E, because  it came into the pictures so often (24); and they drew pictures of the  sacred Beaver of the Tegumais for the B-sound (25, 26, 27, 28); and  because it was a nasty, nosy noise, they just drew noses for the  N-sound, till they were tired (29); and they drew a picture of the big  lake-pike's mouth for the greedy Ga-sound (30); and they drew the pike's  mouth again with a spear behind it for the scratchy, hurty Ka-sound  (31); and they drew pictures of a little bit of the winding Wagai river  for the nice windy-windy Wa-sound (32, 33); and so on and so forth and  so following till they had done and drawn all the sound-pictures that  they wanted, and there was the Alphabet, all complete.    And after thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and after  Hieroglyphics and Demotics, and Nilotics, and Cryptics, and Cufics, and  Runics, and Dorics, and Ionics, and all sorts of other ricks and  tricks (because the Woons, and the Neguses, and the Akhoonds, and the  Repositories of Tradition would never leave a good thing alone when they  saw it), the fine old easy, understandable Alphabet--A, B, C, D, E,  and the rest of 'em--got back into its proper shape again for all Best  Beloveds to learn when they are old enough.    But I remember Tegumai Bopsulai, and Taffimai Metallumai and Teshumai  Tewindrow, her dear Mummy, and all the days gone by. And it was so--just  so--a little time ago--on the banks of the big Wagai!         OF all the Tribe of Tegumai         Who cut that figure, none remain,--       On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry         The silence and the sun remain.         But as the faithful years return         And hearts unwounded sing again,       Comes Taffy dancing through the fern         To lead the Surrey spring again.         Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,         And golden elf-locks fly above;       Her eyes are bright as diamonds         And bluer than the skies above.         In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,         Unfearing, free and fair she flits,       And lights her little damp-wood smoke         To show her Daddy where she flits.         For far--oh, very far behind,         So far she cannot call to him,       Comes Tegumai alone to find         The daughter that was all to him.          THE CRAB THAT PLAYED WITH THE SEA    BEFORE the High and Far-Off Times, O my Best Beloved, came the Time of  the Very Beginnings; and that was in the days when the Eldest Magician  was getting Things ready. First he got the Earth ready; then he got the  Sea ready; and then he told all the Animals that they could come out and  play. And the Animals said, 'O Eldest Magician, what shall we play  at?' and he said, 'I will show you. He took the  Elephant--All-the-Elephant-there-was--and said, 'Play at being  an Elephant,' and All-the-Elephant-there-was played. He took the  Beaver--All-the-Beaver-there-was and said, 'Play at being a Beaver,'  and All-the Beaver-there-was played. He took the Cow--All-the  Cow-there-was--and said, 'Play at being a Cow,' and  All-the-Cow-there-was played. He took the Turtle--All-the-Turtle  there-was and said, 'Play at being a Turtle,' and  All-the-Turtle-there-was played. One by one he took all the beasts and  birds and fishes and told them what to play at.    But towards evening, when people and things grow restless and tired,  there came up the Man (With his own little girl-daughter?)--Yes, with  his own best beloved little girl-daughter sitting upon his shoulder, and  he said, 'What is this play, Eldest Magician?' And the Eldest Magician  said, 'Ho, Son of Adam, this is the play of the Very Beginning; but you  are too wise for this play.' And the Man saluted and said, 'Yes, I am  too wise for this play; but see that you make all the Animals obedient  to me.'    Now, while the two were talking together, Pau Amma the Crab, who was  next in the game, scuttled off sideways and stepped into the sea, saying  to himself, 'I will play my play alone in the deep waters, and I will  never be obedient to this son of Adam.' Nobody saw him go away except  the little girl-daughter where she leaned on the Man's shoulder. And the  play went on till there were no more Animals left without orders; and  the Eldest Magician wiped the fine dust off his hands and walked about  the world to see how the Animals were playing.    He went North, Best Beloved, and he found All-the-Elephant-there-was  digging with his tusks and stamping with his feet in the nice new clean  earth that had been made ready for him.    'Kun?' said All-the-Elephant-there-was, meaning, 'Is this right?'    'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician, meaning, 'That is quite  right'; and he breathed upon the great rocks and lumps of earth that  All-the-Elephant-there-was had thrown up, and they became the great  Himalayan Mountains, and you can look them out on the map.    He went East, and he found All-the-Cow there-was feeding in the field  that had been made ready for her, and she licked her tongue round a  whole forest at a time, and swallowed it and sat down to chew her cud.    'Kun?' said All-the-Cow-there-was.    'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the bare  patch where she had eaten, and upon the place where she had sat down,  and one became the great Indian Desert, and the other became the Desert  of Sahara, and you can look them out on the map.    He went West, and he found All-the-Beaver-there-was making a beaver-dam  across the mouths of broad rivers that had been got ready for him.    'Kun?' said All-the-Beaver-there-was.    'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the fallen  trees and the still water, and they became the Everglades in Florida,  and you may look them out on the map.    Then he went South and found All-the-Turtle-there-was scratching with  his flippers in the sand that had been got ready for him, and the sand  and the rocks whirled through the air and fell far off into the sea.    'Kun?' said All-the-Turtle-there-was.    'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the sand and  the rocks, where they had fallen in the sea, and they became the most  beautiful islands of Borneo, Celebes, Sumatra, Java, and the rest of the  Malay Archipelago, and you can look them out on the map!    By and by the Eldest Magician met the Man on the banks of the Perak  river, and said, 'Ho! Son of Adam, are all the Animals obedient to you?'    'Yes,' said the Man.    'Is all the Earth obedient to you?'    'Yes,' said the Man.    'Is all the Sea obedient to you?'    'No,' said the Man. 'Once a day and once a night the Sea runs up the  Perak river and drives the sweet-water back into the forest, so that my  house is made wet; once a day and once a night it runs down the river  and draws all the water after it, so that there is nothing left but mud,  and my canoe is upset. Is that the play you told it to play?'    'No,' said the Eldest Magician. 'That is a new and a bad play.'    'Look!' said the Man, and as he spoke the great Sea came up the mouth of  the Perak river, driving the river backwards till it overflowed all the  dark forests for miles and miles, and flooded the Man's house.    'This is wrong. Launch your canoe and we will find out who is playing  with the Sea,' said the Eldest Magician. They stepped into the canoe;  the little girl-daughter came with them; and the Man took his kris--a  curving, wavy dagger with a blade like a flame,--and they pushed out on  the Perak river. Then the sea began to run back and back, and the canoe  was sucked out of the mouth of the Perak river, past Selangor, past  Malacca, past Singapore, out and out to the Island of Bingtang, as  though it had been pulled by a string.    Then the Eldest Magician stood up and shouted, 'Ho! beasts, birds, and  fishes, that I took between my hands at the Very Beginning and taught  the play that you should play, which one of you is playing with the  Sea?'    Then all the beasts, birds, and fishes said together, 'Eldest Magician,  we play the plays that you taught us to play--we and our children's  children. But not one of us plays with the Sea.'    Then the Moon rose big and full over the water, and the Eldest Magician  said to the hunchbacked old man who sits in the Moon spinning a  fishing-line with which he hopes one day to catch the world, 'Ho! Fisher  of the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?'    'No,' said the Fisherman, 'I am spinning a line with which I shall some  day catch the world; but I do not play with the Sea.' And he went on  spinning his line.    Now there is also a Rat up in the Moon who always bites the old  Fisherman's line as fast as it is made, and the Eldest Magician said to  him, 'Ho! Rat of the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?'    And the Rat said, 'I am too busy biting through the line that this  old Fisherman is spinning. I do not play with the Sea.' And he went on  biting the line.    Then the little girl-daughter put up her little soft brown arms with the  beautiful white shell bracelets and said, 'O Eldest Magician! when my  father here talked to you at the Very Beginning, and I leaned upon his  shoulder while the beasts were being taught their plays, one beast went  away naughtily into the Sea before you had taught him his play.    And the Eldest Magician said, 'How wise are little children who see and  are silent! What was the beast like?'    And the little girl-daughter said, "]]]
