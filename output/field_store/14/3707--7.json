He will find that its main purpose is this: To teach the  reader how to perceive the hidden and connate abomination of Original Sin;  to set forth distinctly our misery and helplessness; to teach us to put no  trust in ourselves or our ability; to take away everything from ourselves,  and to ascribe all to Christ, so that He alone may dwell in us, work all  things in us, alone live in us, and create all things in us, because he is  the beginning, middle, and end, of our conversion and salvation. All this  has been plainly and abundantly explained in many passages of this Book;  and, at the same time, the doctrines of the Papists, Synergists, and  Majorists, have been expressly refuted and rejected. The doctrine,  moreover, of justification by faith, has been set forth in this Book, and  especially in Book II., in the most pointed and explicit manner. In order,  however, to obviate all misapprehensions, I have subjected the present  edition to a very careful revision, and I beg the reader to receive the  editions which have appeared in Frankfort and other places, in the sense  in which the present Magdeburg edition is to be received. I also affirm,  that this Book, as well in all other articles and points, as also in the  articles of Free Will, and of the Justification of a poor sinner before  God, is not to be understood in any other manner than in accordance with  the Symbolical Books of the churches of the Augsburg Confession, namely,  the first UNALTERED AUGSBURG CONFESSION, the APOLOGY, the SMALCALD  ARTICLES, the TWO CATECHISMS of Luther, and the FORMULA OF CONCORD.    May God enlighten us all by his Holy Spirit, so that we may be sincere and  without offence, both in our faith and in our life, till the day of Christ  (which is near at hand), being filled with the fruits of righteousness,  unto the glory and praise of God! Amen.          Chapter I.                       Showing What The Image Of God In Man Is.          _Be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and ... put on the new      man, which after God is created in righteousness and true      holiness._--EPH. 4:23, 24.      The image of God in man, is the conformity of the soul of man, of his  spirit and mind, of his understanding and will, and of all his faculties  and powers, both bodily and mental, to God and the Holy Trinity. For the  decree of the Holy Trinity was thus expressed: \"_Let us_ make man in our  image, after our likeness,\" etc. Gen., 1:26.    2. It is evident, therefore, that, when man was created, the image of the  Trinity was impressed on him, in order that the holiness, righteousness,  and goodness of God, might shine forth in his soul; diffuse abundant light  through his understanding, will, and affections; and visibly appear even  in his life and conversation: that, consequently, all his actions, both  inward and outward, might breathe nothing but divine love, purity, and  power, and, in short, that the life of man upon earth might resemble that  of the angels in heaven, who are always engaged in doing the will of their  Heavenly Father. In thus impressing his image on man, God designed to  delight and rejoice in him, just as a father rejoices in a child born  after his own image: for as a parent, beholding himself, or _another  self_, in his offspring, cannot but feel the greatest complacency and  delight; so, when God beheld the express character of his own Person  reflected in an image of himself, his \"delights were with the sons of  men.\" Prov. 8:31. Thus it was God's chief pleasure to look on man, in whom  he rejoiced, and rested, as it were, from all his labor; considering him  as the great _masterpiece_ of his creation, and knowing that in the  perfect innocence and beauty of man, the excellency of his own glory would  be fully set forth. And this blessed communion our first parents and their  posterity were always to have enjoyed, had they continued in the likeness  of God, and rested in him and in his will; who, as he was their author,  was also to be their end.    3. It undoubtedly is the essential property of every image, that it be a  just representation of the object which it is intended to express; and as  the reflection in a mirror is vivid in a degree proportioned to the  clearness of the mirror itself, so the image of God becomes more or less  visible, according to the purity of the soul in which it is beheld.    4. Hence God originally created man perfectly pure and undefiled; that so  the divine image might be beheld in him, not as an empty, lifeless shadow  in a glass, but as a true and living image of the invisible God, and as  the likeness of his inward, hidden, and unutterable beauty. There was an  image of the wisdom of God, in the _understanding_ of man; of his  goodness, gentleness, and patience, in the _spirit_ of man; of his divine  love and mercy, in the _affections_ of man's heart. There was an image of  the righteousness and holiness, the justice and purity of God, in the  _will_ of man; of his kindness, clemency, and truth, in all the _words_  and _actions_ of man; of his almighty power, in man's _dominion_ over the  earth, and inferior creatures; and lastly, there was an image of God's  eternity, in the _immortality_ of the human soul.    5. From the divine image thus implanted in him, man should have acquired  the knowledge both of _God_ and of _himself_. Hence he might have learned,  that God, his Creator, is all in all, the Being of beings, and the chief  and only BEING, from whom all created beings derive their existence, and  in whom, and by whom, all things that are, subsist. Hence, also, he might  have known, that God, as the Original of man's nature, is all that  _essentially_, of which he himself was but the image and representation.  For since man was to bear the image of the divine goodness, it follows  that God is the sovereign and universal goodness _essentially_ (Matt.  19:17); and, consequently, that God is essential love, essential life, and  essential holiness, to whom alone (because he is all this _essentially_),  worship and praise, honor and glory, might, majesty, dominion, and virtue,  are to be ascribed: whereas these do not appertain to the creature, nor  belong to anything but God alone.    6. From this image of the Divine Being, man should further have acquired  the knowledge of _himself_. He should have considered what a vast  difference there was between God and himself. Man is not God, but God's  _image_; and the image of God ought to represent nothing but God. He is a  portraiture of the Divine Being; a character, an image, in which God alone  should be seen and glorified. Nothing therefore ought to live in man,  besides God. Nothing but the Divinity should stir, will, love, think,  speak, act, or rejoice in him. For if anything besides God live or work in  man, he ceases to be the image of God; and becomes the image of that which  thus lives and acts within him. If therefore a man would become, and  continue to be, the image of God, he must wholly surrender himself to the  Divine Being, and submit entirely to his will; he must suffer God to work  in him whatsoever he pleases; so that, by denying his own will, he may do  the will of his Heavenly Father without reserve, being entirely resigned  to God, and willing to become a holy instrument in his hands, to do his  will and his work. Such a man follows not his _own_ will, but the will of  God; he loves not himself, but God; seeks not his own honor, but the honor  of God. He covets no estates nor affluence for himself, but refers all to  the Supreme Good; and so being contented to possess him, rises above the  love of the creature and the world. And thus ought man to divest himself  of all love of himself and the world, that God alone may be all in him,  and work all in him, by his Holy Spirit. Herein consisted the perfect  innocence, purity, and holiness of man. For, what greater innocence can  there be, than that a man should do, not his own will, but the will of his  Heavenly Father? Or what greater purity, than that man should suffer God  to work in him, and to do everything according to His pleasure? Or, what  greater holiness, than to become an instrument in the hands of the Spirit  of God? To resemble a child, in whose breast self-love and self-honor do  not yet prevail, is, in truth, the highest simplicity.    7. Of this entire devotedness to the Divine will, our Lord Jesus Christ,  while he sojourned in our world, was a _perfect_ example. He sacrificed  his own will to God his Father, in blameless obedience, humility, and  meekness; readily depriving himself of all honor and esteem, of all  self-interest and self-love, of all pleasure and joy; and leaving God  alone, to think, speak, and act, in him, and by him. In short, he  invariably made the will and pleasure of God his own, as the Father  himself testified by a voice from Heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom  I am well pleased.\" Matt. 3:17. The Lord Jesus Christ, blessed forever, is  the true Image of God, in whom nothing appears but God himself, and such  manifestations as are agreeable to his nature; namely, love, mercy,  long-suffering, patience, meekness, gentleness, righteousness, holiness,  consolation, life, and everlasting blessedness: for by him, the invisible  God was willing to be discovered and made known to man. He is indeed the  image of God in a more sublime sense; that is, according to his  _Divinity_, by virtue of which, he is himself very God, the express and  essential image of his Father's glory, in the infinite splendor of the  uncreated light. Heb. 1:3. But of this point no more can at present be  said: our design being to speak of him only as he lived and conversed in  his holy _humanity_, while he tabernacled upon the earth.    8. It was in such a holy innocence as this, that the image of God was, in  the beginning, conferred on Adam, which he should have preserved in true  humility "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#11)"],[1,"birds and of their  eggs is marvellous. The story of how a photograph of a Dottrel's nest  was obtained is of value to teachers, for it will remind us that it  is not well to neglect the three R's, and that Nature-study alone  will not give a complete education. Three bird-lovers spent some time  trying to find this nest, while the parent birds flew noisily around.  Suspecting at last that the birds' knowledge of numbers was probably  deficient, the three hid behind a log. Two then walked away. The birds  immediately returned to the nest, and a valuable photograph was the  result. A training in Nature-study, valuable as it undoubtedly is, is  thus not all of our work.    The Painted Snipe breeds in Australia, but the Australian Snipe breeds  in Japan, so it, properly speaking, is not an Australian bird. Think  of the journey twice a year! Six of these wading-birds even visit New  Zealand each year. How do they find their way there, across a gap  of over 1000 miles, without any land whatever? Inherited memory is  strong, but how did the first batches find their way? Their annual  journey supports the geographer in his surmise that Australia at no  very distant date extended very much farther to the east. Indeed,  these birds almost certainly follow the old coast of the Australian  continent.    Snipe, some Plovers, Dottrels, Curlews (Sea), Whimbrels, Godwits, &c.,  thus go to the North each year to partake of the abundant banquet  of fruits, &c., preserved in the great ice chamber of the North.  Numberless flocks of birds follow up the melting ice, and so nest  unmolested on the great tundras and plains of Siberia. They wear their  bright wedding dress in the far North, and are known here only in the  quiet mottled browns and grays. In autumn these birds depart. They  travel mostly at night, to avoid Birds of Prey, and so are seldom  seen, though they may be heard calling as they pass high overhead.  They are occasionally seen with the aid of telescopes as they pass  across the face of the moon.    The Pratincole, or Swallow-Plover, is a representative of an Old-World  family. Its long wings and long legs denote a rapid runner and a rapid  flyer, so that it has little trouble in catching its insect food,  either in the air or on the ground.    Our inland Stone-Curlew has a call very similar to that of the sea  (true) Curlew, but it has a short, straight bill, instead of a long,  arched bill. The proper name of the land Curlew is the Southern  Stone-Curlew or Stone-Plover. It is the only Australian bird that  seems to have the power of varying the color of its eggs. If the eggs  are laid in grass, they are greenish; if amongst ironstone, the eggs  are reddish-brown; if on sand, the eggs are tawny; and so on. Other  ground-laying birds seem to pick out the soil that matches the  color of their eggs, and lay there only. Possibly local races of the  Southern Stone-Curlew keep to the one class of country. However, the  eggs do match the surroundings, and the birds nest on different kinds  of soil and rock.    In Family 42, the only Australian bird is the Australian Bustard, our  representative of a widely-spread family, a member of which formerly  bred in Great Britain. It is the well-known \"Wild Turkey.\" As it is a  good table bird, it is generally shot on sight. This is a mistake,  as it is (as Mr. C. French, Government Entomologist, has pointed out)  worth many times its table value as an insect destroyer. None of the  family has spread to America. As no Bustard occurs in the regions  between Australia and India, this bird supplies a good example of  what is known to zoo-geographers as \"discontinuous distribution.\"  \"Discontinuous distribution,\" as applied to land animals, _e.g._,  marsupials found in America and Australia, ratite birds in South  America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, or the tapir,  found in Central America and Malaysia, implies a land connexion (not  necessarily complete at any one period) to allow of the gradual spread  of the animals. Of course, as flying birds can pass easily from one  region to another, \"discontinuous distribution,\" as applied to them,  cannot have so much importance attached to it as indicating previous  land connexions.    ====      [Page 42]      [Illustration: [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82]]        ORDER X.--CHARADRIIFORMES.
