F. Cruse.    _Mosheim_: Dr. J. L. von Mosheim, chancellor of the University of  Gottingen; a German writer, noted for his contributions to church  history. He is the author of an exhaustive work on \"Ecclesiastical  History\" (6 vols.), dated 1755.

A hasty and casual reading of the passage may suggest the  inference that the \"ungodly men\" referred to had been appointed or  \"ordained\" in the providence of God to sow the seeds of discord and  dissension in the Church. A careful study of this scripture shows that  no such inference is warranted. The \"ungodly men\" \"who were before of  old ordained to this condemnation\" were men who had already, i. e.,  previously, been denounced, proscribed and condemned for the very  heresies which now they were endeavoring to perpetuate in the Church,  they having crept in unawares, or in other words, they having become  members of the Church by false pretenses and profession, and being  able because of their membership, to spread their false teachings more  effectively. Dr. Adam Clarke, in his Bible Commentary, thus treats the  passage under consideration:    \"_For there are certain men crept in unawares_.\" They have got into  the church under specious pretenses, and when in, began to sow their  bad seed.    \"_Before of old ordained_: Such as were long ago proscribed and  condemned in the most public manner; this is the import of the  [original] word in this place, and there are many examples of this use  of it in the Greek writers.\"    \"_To this condemnation_: To a similar punishment to that about to be  mentioned.    \"In the sacred writings all such persons, false doctrines and impure  practices have been most openly proscribed and condemned, and the  apostle immediately produces several examples, viz., the disobedient  Israelites, the unfaithful angels, and the impure inhabitants of Sodom  and Gomorrah. This is most obviously the apostle's meaning, and it is  as ridiculous as it is absurd, to look into such words for a decree of  reprobation, etc., such a doctrine being as far from the apostle's  mind as from that of Him in whose name he wrote.\"--(Clarke, \"Bible  Commentary,\" Jude 4.)    In the Revised Version of the New Testament the passage is rendered  thus: \"I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend  earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the  saints. For there are certain men crept in privily, even they who were  of old set forth unto this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the  grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and  Lord, Jesus Christ.\"          CHAPTER IV.    **Causes of the Apostasy.--External Causes Considered**.      1. We are now to consider some of the principal causes contributing to  apostasy from the Primitive Church and leading later to the apostasy  of the Church as an earthly institution; and we are to study the  manner in which those causes have operated.    2. In the scriptures before cited as proof of the early beginning of  the apostasy, many of the contributing causes are indicated, such as  the rise of false teachers, the spread of heretical doctrines, and the  growth of the power of Satan in general. These may be classed as  internal causes, originating within the Church itself. In contrast  with these there were other conditions operating upon the Church from  without; and such may be classed as external causes. For convenience  in study we shall consider the subject in the following order of  treatment: (1) External causes; (2) Internal causes.    **External Causes of the Great Apostasy**.    3. External conditions operating against the Church, tending to  restrict its development and contributing to its decline may be  designated by the general term; _persecution_. It is a matter of  history, undisputed and indisputable, that from the time of its  inception to that of its actual cessation, the Church established by  Jesus Christ was the object of bitter persecution, and the victim of  violence. The question as to whether persecution is to be regarded as  an element tending to produce apostasy is worthy of present  consideration. Opposition is not always destructive; on the contrary  it may contribute to growth. Persecution may impel to greater zeal,  and thus prove itself a potent factor of advancement. A proverb still  in favor declares that \"the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the  Church.\" But proverbs and adages, aphorisms and parables, while true  as generalities, are not always applicable to special conditions.    4. Undoubtedly the persistent persecution to which the early Church  was subjected caused many of its adherents to renounce the faith they  had professed and to return to their former allegiances, whether  Judaistic or pagan. Church membership was thus diminished; but such  instances of apostasy from the Church may be regarded as individual  desertions and of comparatively little importance in its effect upon  the Church as a body. The dangers that affrighted some would arouse  the determination of others; the ranks deserted by disaffected  weaklings would be replenished by zealous converts. Let it be repeated  that apostasy from the Church is insignificant as compared with the  apostasy of the church as an institution. Persecution as a cause of  apostasy has operated indirectly but none the less effectively upon  the Church of Christ.--(See Notes 1 and 2, end of chapter.)    5. We have considered briefly the testimony of early church historians  showing that schisms, contention, and perversion of doctrine invaded  the Church immediately after the passing of the apostles; we have seen  how wolves had awaited the departure of the shepherds that they might  the more effectively worry the flock. It cannot be denied that the  early persecutions were directed most particularly against the leaders  of the people; the sharpest shafts were aimed against the officers of  the Church. In the fierce battle between Christianity and its allied  foes--Judaism and heathendom--the strong men who stood for Christ were  the first to fall. And with their fall, the traitors within the  Church, the ungodly and the rebellious, those who had crept in  unawares, and whose sinister purpose it was to pervert the gospel of  Christ, were relieved of restraint, and found themselves free to  propagate their heresies and to undermine the foundations of the  Church. Persecution, operating from without, and therefore essentially  an external cause, served to set in motion the enginery of disruption  within the Church, and therefore must be treated as an effective  element contributing to the great apostasy.    6. A further purpose in introducing here a brief summary of the  persecutions of which the early Church was the victim, is that of  affording a basis of ready comparison between such and the  persecutions waged by the apostate church itself in later centuries.  We shall find that the sufferings of the Church in the days of its  integrity, are surpassed by the cruel inflictions perpetrated in the  name of Christ. Moreover, a study of the early persecutions will  enable us to contrast the conditions of opposition and poverty with  those of ease and affluence as affecting the integrity of the Church  and the devotion of its adherents.    7. The persecution to which the Primitive Church was subjected was  two-fold; viz., Judaistic and pagan. It must be remembered that the  Jews were distinguished from all other nations of antiquity by their  belief in the existence of a living God. The rest of the world before  and at the time of Christ was idolatrous and pagan, professedly  believing in a host of deities, yet with no recognition of a Supreme  Being as a living personage. The Jews were bitter in their opposition  to Christianity, which they regarded as a rival religion to their own;  and moreover, they recognized the fact that if Christianity ever came  to be generally accepted as the truth, their nation would stand  convicted of having put to death the Messiah.    **Judaistic Persecution**.    (See Note 3, end of Chapter.)    8. Opposition to Christianity on the part of those who belonged to the  House of Israel was rather Judaistic than Jewish. The conflict was  between systems, not between peoples or nations. Christ was a Jew: His  apostles were Jews, and the disciples who constituted the body of the  Church at its establishment and throughout the early years of its  existence were largely Jews. Our Lord's instructions to the chosen  twelve on their first missionary tour restricted their ministry to the  House of Israel;--(See Matt. 10:5, 6.) and when the time was  propitious for extending the privileges of the gospel to the Gentiles,  a miraculous manifestation was necessary to convince the apostles that  such extension was proper.--(See Acts, chapters 10 and 11.) The Church  was at first exclusively and for a long time pre-eminently Jewish in  membership. Judaism, the religious system founded on the law of Moses,  was the great enemy of Christianity. When therefore we read of the  Jews"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#11)"],[1,"travagant, dissipated, and generally ne'er-do-weel; but instead  of helplessly sitting down to regret their marriage-day, they take the  management of everything into their own hands, and make the best of the  inevitable by patient endurance in well-doing. It is sometimes said that  \"any husband is better than none.\" Perhaps so; in the sense of his being  a sort of domestic Attila, a \"scourge of God\" to \"whip the offending  Adam\" out of a woman and turn her into an angel, as the wives of some  bad husbands seem to become.    \"I will do anything,\" says Portia, in the \"Merchant of Venice,\" \"ere I  will be married to a sponge;\" and in answer to the question--\"How like  you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?\" she answers: \"Very  vilely in the morning, when he is sober; and most vilely in the  afternoon, when he is drunk: when he is best he is a little worse than a  man; and when he is worst he is little better than a beast: an the worst  fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.\"    When a poor girl has not had Portia's discernment to discover such  faults before marriage, what can she do? She can do her best.    \"What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?\"  Endeavouring to do this, you will not only have the answer of a good  conscience, but will have taken the best precaution against falling  yourself, so that it never can be truly said of you--      \"As the husband is, the wife is; thou art mated with a clown,    And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.\"    It has been said that to have loved and lost--either by that total  disenchantment which leaves compassion as the sole substitute for love  which can exist no more, or by the slow torment which is obliged to let  go day by day all that constitutes the diviner part of love, namely,  reverence, belief, and trust, yet clings desperately to the only thing  left it, a long-suffering apologetic tenderness--this lot is probably  the hardest any woman can have to bear.      \"What is good for a bootless bane?--      And she made answer, 'Endless sorrow.'\"    This answer should never have been made, for none but the guilty can be  long and completely miserable. The effect and duration of sorrow greatly  depends upon ourselves. \"If thou hast a bundle of thorns in thy lot, at  least thou need'st not insist on sitting down on them.\" Nor must we  forget that there is a \"wondrous alchemy in time and the power of God\"  to transmute our sorrows, as well as our faults and errors, into golden  blessings.    It is an old maxim that if one will not, two cannot quarrel. If one of  the heads of a house has a bad temper, there is all the more reason for  the other to be cool and collected, and capable of keeping domestic  peace. Think of Socrates, who, when his wife Zanthippe concluded a fit  of scolding by throwing at him a bucket of water, quietly remarked,  \"After the thunder comes the rain.\" And when she struck him, to some  friends who would have had him strike her again, he replied, that he  would not make them sport, nor that they should stand by and say, \"_Eia  Socrates, eia Zanthippe!_\" as boys do when dogs fight, animate them more  by clapping hands.    If we would learn how to make the worst instead of the best of a  matrimonial bargain, Adam, the first husband, will teach us. He allowed  himself to be tempted by Eve, and then like a true coward tried to put  all the blame upon her. This little bit of history repeats itself every  day. \"In the state of innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack  Falstaff do in the days of villainy?\"    There is another way in which people make the worst instead of the best  of their bad matrimonial bargains. \"Faults are thick where love is  thin,\" and love having become thin they exaggerate the badness of their  bargains. A man, having one well-formed and one crooked leg, was wont to  test the disposition of his friends, by observing which leg they looked  at first or most. Surely the last people we should draw with their worst  leg foremost are our life partners. The best of men are only _men_ at  the best. They are, as Sterne said, \"a strange compound of contradictory  qualities; and were the accidental oversights and folly of the wisest  man--the failings and imperfections of a religious man--the hasty acts  and passionate words of a meek man--were they to rise up in judgment  against them, and an ill-natured judge to be suffered to mark in this  manner what has been done amiss, what character so unexceptionable as  to be able to stand before him?\" Ought husbands and wives to be  ill-natured judges of what is amiss?    \"Let a man,\" says Seneca, \"consider his own vices, reflect upon his own  follies, and he will see that he has the greatest reason to be angry  with himself.\" The best advice to give husband and wife is to ask them  to resolve in the words of Shakespeare, \"I will chide no breather in the  world but myself, against whom I know most faults.\" Why beholdest thou  the mote that is in the eye of thy matrimonial bargain, but considerest  not the beam that is in thine own eye?    When you find yourself complaining of your matrimonial bargain, think  sometimes whether you deserve a better one. What right and title has thy  greedy soul to domestic happiness or to any other kind of happiness?  \"Fancy,\" says Carlyle, \"thou deservest to be hanged (as is most likely),  thou wilt feel it happiness to be only shot.\" We may imagine that we  deserve a perfect matrimonial bargain, but a less partial observer like  Lord Braxfield might make a correction in our estimate. This Scotch  judge once said to an eloquent culprit at the bar, \"Ye're a verra clever  chiel, mon, but I'm thinkin' ye wad be nane the waur o' a hangin'.\"  Equally instructive is the story of a magistrate, who, when a thief  remonstrated, \"But, sir, I must live,\" replied, \"I don't recognize the  necessity.\" It is only when we cease to believe that we must have  supreme domestic and other kinds of felicity, that we are able with a  contented mind to bear our share of the \"weary weight of all this  unintelligible world.\"    In reference to marriage and to everything else in life, we should  sometimes reflect how much worse off we might be instead of how much  better. Perhaps you are like the man who said, \"I must put up with it,\"  when he had only turkey and plum pudding for dinner. If, as it has often  been said, all men brought their grievances of mind, body, and  estate--their lunacies, epilepsies, cancers, bereavement, beggary,  imprisonment--and laid them on a heap to be equally divided, would you  share alike and take your portion, or be as you are? Without question  you would be as you are. And perhaps if all matrimonial bargains were to  be again distributed, it would be better for you to keep what you have  than to run the chance of getting worse. A man who grumbled at the  badness of his shoes felt ashamed on meeting with one who had no feet.  \"Consider the pains which martyrs have endured, and think how even now  many people are bearing afflictions beyond all measure greater than  yours, and say, 'Of a truth my trouble is comfort, my torments are but  roses as compared to those whose life is a continual death, without  solace, or aid, or consolation, borne down with a weight of grief  tenfold greater than mine.'\"      \"Oft in life's stillest shade reclining,    In desolation unrepining,    Without a hope on earth to find    A mirror in an answering mind,    Meek souls there are, who little dream    Their daily strife an angel's theme,    Or that the rod they take so calm    Shall prove in Heaven a martyr's palm.\"    One of these \"meek souls\" is reported to have said to a friend, \"You  know not the joy of an accepted sorrow.\" And of every disappointment, we  may truly say that people know not how well it may be borne until they  have tried to bear it. This, which is true of disappointment in general,  is no less true of the disappointments of a married pair. Those who have  not found in marriage all that they fondly, and perhaps over sanguinely,  anticipated, may, after some time, become to a certain extent happy  though married, if they resolve to do their best under the  circumstances.          CHAPTER VII.    MARRIAGE CONSIDERED AS A DISCIPLINE OF CHARACTER.         \"Certainly wife and children are a kind of Discipline of       Humanity.\"--_Bacon._         \"I well remember the bright assenting laugh which she (Mrs.       Carlyle) once responded to some words of mine, when the propriety       was being discussed of relaxing the marriage laws. I had said       that the true way to look at marriage was as a discipline of       character.\"--_Froude._      \"Did you ever see anything so absurd as a horse sprawling like that?\"  This was the hasty exclamation of a connoisseur on taking up a small  cabinet picture. \"Excuse me,\" replied the owner, \"you hold it the wrong  way: it is a horse galloping.\" So much depends upon the way we look at  things. In the preceding chapter we spoke of making the best of bad  matrimonial bargains. Perhaps it would help some people to do this if  they looked at marriage from a different point of view--if they  considered it as a discipline of character rather than as a short cut  to the highest heaven of happiness. Certainly this is a practical point  of view, and it may be that those who marry in this spirit are more  likely to use their matrimony rightly than those who start with  happiness as their only goal. That people get happiness by being willing  to pass it by and do without it rather than by directly pursuing it, is  as true of domestic felicity as of other kinds.    \"Ven you're a married man, Samivel,\" says Mr. Weller to his son Sam,  \"you'll understand a good many things as you don't understand now; but  vether it's worth while going through so much to learn so little, as the  charity boy said ven he got to the end of the alphabet, is a"]]]
