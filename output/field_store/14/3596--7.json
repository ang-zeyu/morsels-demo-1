An instant in this porch she stayed                            530    And gaily to the stranger said,    \"On heaven and on thy lady call,    And enter the enchanted hall!\"      XXVII      \"My hope, my heaven, my trust must be,    My gentle guide, in following thee.\"                           535    He crossed the threshold--and a clang    Of angry steel that instant rang.    To his bold brow his spirit rushed,    But soon for vain alarm he blushed,    When on the floor he saw displayed,                            540    Cause of the din, a naked blade    Dropped from the sheath, that careless flung    Upon a stag's huge antlers swung;    For all around, the walls to grace,    Hung trophies of the fight or chase:                           545    A target there, a bugle here,    A battle-ax, a hunting spear,    And broadswords, bows, and arrows store,    With the tusked trophies of the boar.    Here grins the wolf as when he died,                           550    And there the wild-cat's brindled hide    The frontlet of the elk adorns,    Or mantles o'er the bison's horns;    Pennons and flags defaced and stained,    That blackening streaks of blood retained,                     555    And deer-skins, dappled, dun, and white,    With otter's fur and seal's unite,    In rude and uncouth tapestry all,    To garnish forth the silvan hall.      XXVIII      The wondering stranger round him gazed,                        560    And next the fallen weapon raised--    Few were the arms whose sinewy strength,    Sufficed to stretch it forth at length.    And as the brand he poised and swayed,    \"I never knew but one,\" he said,                               565    \"Whose stalwart arm might brook to wield    A blade like this in battle-field.\"    She sighed, then smiled and took the word:    \"You see the guardian champion's sword;    As light it trembles in his hand,                              570    As in my grasp a hazel wand;    My sire's tall form might grace the part    Of Ferragus, or Ascabart;    But in the absent giant's hold    Are women now, and menials old.\"                               575      XXIX      The mistress of the mansion came,    Mature of age, a graceful dame;    Whose easy step and stately port    Had well become a princely court,    To whom, though more than kindred knew,                        580    Young Ellen gave a mother's due.    Meet welcome to her guest she made,    And every courteous rite was paid,    That hospitality could claim,    Though all unasked his birth and name.                         585    Such then the reverence to a guest,    That fellest foe might join the feast,    And from his deadliest foeman's door    Unquestioned turn, the banquet o'er.    At length his rank the stranger names,                         590    \"The Knight of Snowdoun, James Fitz-James;    Lord of a barren heritage,    Which his brave sires, from age to age,    By their good swords had held with toil;    His sire had fallen in such turmoil,                           595    And he, God wot, was forced to stand    Oft for his right with blade in hand.    This morning, with Lord Moray's train    He chased a stalwart stag in vain,    Outstripped his comrades, missed the deer,                     600    Lost his good steed, and wandered here.\"      XXX      Fain would the Knight in turn require    The name and state of Ellen's sire.    Well showed the elder lady's mien,    That courts and cities she had seen;                           605    Ellen, though more her looks displayed    The simple grace of silvan maid,    In speech and gesture, form and face,    Showed she was come of gentle race.    'Twere strange in ruder rank to find                           610    Such looks, such manners, and such mind.    Each hint the Knight of Snowdoun gave,    Dame Margaret heard with silence grave;    Or Ellen, innocently gay,    Turned all inquiry light away:                                 615    \"Weird women we--by dale and down    We dwell, afar from tower and town.    We stem the flood, we ride the blast,    On wandering knights our spells we cast;    While viewless minstrels touch the string,                     620    'Tis thus our charmed rimes we sing.\"    She sung, and still a harp unseen    Filled up the symphony between.      XXXI    SONG      \"Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,      Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking;                      625    Dream of battled fields no more,      Days of danger, nights of waking.    In our isle's enchanted hall,      Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,    Fairy strains of music fall,                                   630      Every sense in slumber dewing.    Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,    Dream of fighting fields no more;    Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,    Morn of toil, nor night of waking.                             635      \"No rude sound shall reach thine ear,      Armor's clang, or war-steed champing,    Trump nor pibroch summon here      Mustering clan, or squadron tramping.    Yet the lark's shrill fife may come                            640      At the day-break from the fallow,    And the bittern sound his drum,      Booming from the sedgy shallow.    Ruder sounds shall none be near,    Guards nor warders challenge here,                             645    Here's no war-steed's neigh and champing,    Shouting clans or squadrons stamping.\"      XXXII      She paused--then, blushing, led the lay    To grace the stranger of the day.    Her mellow notes awhile prolong                                650    The cadence of the flowing song,    Till to her lips in measured frame    The minstrel verse spontaneous came.      SONG--(_Continued_)      \"Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done,      While our slumbrous spells assail ye,                        655    Dream not, with the rising sun,      Bugles here shall sound reveille.    Sleep! the deer is in his den;      Sleep! thy hounds are by thee lying;    Sleep! nor dream in yonder glen,                               660      How thy gallant steed lay dying.    Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done,    Think not of the rising sun,    For at dawning to assail ye,    Here no bugles sound reveille.\"                                665      XXXIII      The hall was cleared--the stranger's bed    Was there of mountain heather spread,    Where oft a hundred guests had lain,    And dreamed their forest sports again.    But vainly did the heath-flower shed                           670    Its moorland fragrance round his head;    Not Ellen's spell had lulled to rest    The fever of his troubled breast.    In broken dreams the image rose    Of varied perils, pains, and woes:                             675    His steed now flounders in the brake,    Now sinks his barge upon the lake;    Now leader of a broken host,    His standard falls, his honor's lost.    Then--from my couch may heavenly might                         680    Chase that worst phantom of the night!    Again returned the scenes of youth,    Of confident undoubting truth;    Again his soul he interchanged    With friends whose hearts were long estranged.                 685    They come, in dim procession led,    The cold, the faithless, and the dead;    As warm each hand, each brow as gay,    As if they parted yesterday.    And doubt distracts him at the view--                          690    O were his senses false or true?    Dreamed he of death, or broken vow,    Or is it all a vision now?      XXXIV      At length, with Ellen in a grove    He seemed to walk, and speak of love;                          695    She listened with a blush and sigh,    His suit was warm, his hopes were high.    He sought her yielded hand to clasp,    And a cold gauntlet met his grasp;    The phantom's sex was changed and gone,                        700    Upon its head a helmet shone;    Slowly enlarged to giant size,    With darkened cheek and threatening eyes,    The grisly visage, stern and hoar,    To Ellen still a likeness bore.                                705    He woke, and, panting with affright,    Recalled the vision of the night.    The hearth's decaying brands were red.    And deep and dusky luster shed,    Half showing, half concealing, all                             710    The uncouth trophies of the hall.    Mid those the stranger fixed his eye,    Where that huge falchion hung on high,    And thoughts on thoughts, a countless throng,    Rushed, chasing countless thoughts along.                      715    Until, the giddy whirl to cure,    He rose, and sought the moonshine pure.      XXXV      The wild-rose, eglantine, and broom,    Wasted around their rich perfume:    The birch-trees swept in fragrant balm,                        720    The aspens slept beneath the calm;    The silver light, with quivering glance,    Played on the water's still expanse--    Wild were the heart whose passion's sway    Could rage beneath the sober ray!                              725    He felt its calm, that warrior guest,    While thus he communed with his breast:    \"Why is it, at each turn I trace    Some memory of that exiled race?    Can I not mountain-maiden spy,                                 730    But she must bear the Douglas eye?    Can I not view a Highland brand,    But it must match the Douglas hand?    Can I not frame a fevered dream,    But still the Douglas is the theme?                            735    I'll dream no more--by manly mind    Not even in sleep is will resigned.    My midnight orisons said o'er,    I'll turn to rest, and dream no more.\"    His midnight orisons he told,                                  740    A prayer with every bead of gold,    Consigned to heaven his cares and woes,    And sunk"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#11)"],[1,"remote and unconnected in speech, have  practically much the same myths.

I. recapitulated--Proposal of a new method: Science of  comparative or historical study of man--Anticipated in part by  Eusebius, Fontenelle, De Brosses, Spencer (of C. C. C., Cambridge), and  Mannhardt--Science of Tylor--Object of inquiry: to find condition of  human intellect in which marvels of myth are parts of practical everyday  belief--This is the savage state--Savages described--The wild element of  myth a survival from the savage state--Advantages of this method--Partly  accounts for wide DIFFUSION as well as ORIGIN of myths--Connected  with general theory of evolution--Puzzling example of myth of the  water-swallower--Professor Tiele's criticism of the method--Objections  to method, and answer to these--See Appendix B.      The past systems of mythological interpretation have been briefly  sketched. It has been shown that the practical need for a reconciliation  between RELIGION and MORALITY on one side, and the MYTHS about the gods  on the other, produced the hypotheses of Theagenes and Metrodorus, of  Socrates and Euemerus, of Aristotle and Plutarch. It has been shown that  in each case the reconcilers argued on the basis of their own ideas and  of the philosophies of their time. The early physicist thought that  myth concealed a physical philosophy; the early etymologist saw in it a  confusion of language; the early political speculator supposed that myth  was an invention of legislators; the literary Euhemerus found the secret  of myths in the course of an imaginary voyage to a fabled island.  Then came the moment of the Christian attacks, and Pagan philosophers,  touched with Oriental pantheism, recognised in myths certain pantheistic  symbols and a cryptic revelation of their own Neo-platonism. When the  gods were dead and their altars fallen, then antiquaries brought their  curiosity to the problem of explaining myth. Christians recognised in it  a depraved version of the Jewish sacred writings, and found the ark on  every mountain-top of Greece. The critical nineteenth century brought  in, with Otfried Muller and Lobeck, a closer analysis; and finally, in  the sudden rise of comparative philology, it chanced that philologists  annexed the domain of myths. Each of these systems had its own amount of  truth, but each certainly failed to unravel the whole web of tradition  and of foolish faith.    Meantime a new science has come into existence, the science which  studies man in the sum of all his works and thoughts, as evolved  through the whole process of his development. This science, Comparative  Anthropology, examines the development of law out of custom; the  development of weapons from the stick or stone to the latest repeating  rifle; the development of society from the horde to the nation. It is a  study which does not despise the most backward nor degraded tribe, nor  neglect the most civilised, and it frequently finds in Australians  or Nootkas the germ of ideas and institutions which Greeks or Romans  brought to perfection, or retained, little altered from their early  rudeness, in the midst of civilisation.    It is inevitable that this science should also try its hand on  mythology. Our purpose is to employ the anthropological method--the  study of the evolution of ideas, from the savage to the barbarous, and  thence to the civilised stage--in the province of myth, ritual, and  religion. It has been shown that the light of this method had dawned on  Eusebius in his polemic with the heathen apologists. Spencer, the head  of Corpus, Cambridge (1630-93), had really no other scheme in his mind  in his erudite work on Hebrew Ritual.(1) Spencer was a student of man's  religions generally, and he came to the conclusion that Hebrew ritual  was but an expurgated, and, so to speak, divinely \"licensed\" adaptation  of heathen customs at large. We do but follow his guidance on less  perilous ground when we seek for the original forms of classical rite  and myth in the parallel usages and legends of the most backward races.      (1) De Legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibus, Tubingae, 1782.      Fontenelle in the last century, stated, with all the clearness of the  French intellect, the system which is partially worked out in this  essay--the system which explains the irrational element in myth as  inherited from savagery. Fontenelle's paper (Sur l'Origine des Fables)  is brief, sensible, and witty, and requires little but copious evidence  to make it adequate. But he merely threw out the idea, and left it to be  neglected.(1)      (1) See Appendix A., Fontenelle's Origine des Fables.      Among other founders of the anthropological or historical school of  mythology, De Brosses should not be forgotten. In his Dieux Fetiches  (1760) he follows the path which Eusebius indicated--the path of Spencer  and Fontenelle--now the beaten road of Tylor and M'Lennan and Mannhardt.    In anthropology, in the science of Waitz, Tylor, and M'Lennan, in  the examination of man's faith in the light of his social, legal, and  historical conditions generally, we find, with Mannhardt, some of the  keys of myth. This science \"makes it manifest that the different stages  through which humanity has passed in its intellectual evolution have  still their living representatives among various existing races.  The study of these lower races is an invaluable instrument for the  interpretation of the survivals from earlier stages, which we meet in  the full civilisation of cultivated peoples, but whose origins were in  the remotest fetichism and savagery.\"(1)      (1) Mannhardt op. cit. p. xxiii.      It is by following this road, and by the aid of anthropology and  of human history, that we propose to seek for a demonstrably actual  condition of the human intellect, whereof the puzzling qualities of myth  would be the natural and inevitable fruit. In all the earlier theories  which we have sketched, inquirers took it for granted that the  myth-makers were men with philosophic and moral ideas like their  own--ideas which, from some reason of religion or state, they expressed  in bizarre terms of allegory. We shall attempt, on the other hand, to  prove that the human mind has passed through a condition quite unlike  that of civilised men--a condition in which things seemed natural and  rational that now appear unnatural and devoid of reason, and in which,  therefore, if myths were evolved, they would, if they survived into  civilisation, be such as civilised men find strange and perplexing.    Our first question will be, Is there a stage of human society and of  the human intellect in which facts that appear to us to be monstrous  and irrational--facts corresponding to the wilder incidents of myth--are  accepted as ordinary occurrences of everyday life? In the region of  romantic rather than of mythical invention we know that there is such  a state. Mr. Lane, in his preface to the Arabian Nights, says that the  Arabs have an advantage over us as story-tellers. They can introduce  such incidents as the change of a man into a horse, or of a woman into a  dog, or the intervention of an Afreet without any more scruple than our  own novelists feel in describing a duel or the concealment of a will.  Among the Arabs the agencies of magic and of spirits are regarded as at  least as probable and common as duels and concealments of wills seem  to be thought by European novelists. It is obvious that we need look no  farther for the explanation of the supernatural events in Arab romances.  Now, let us apply this system to mythology. It is admitted that Greeks,  Romans, Aryans of India in the age of the Sanskrit commentators, and  Egyptians of the Ptolemaic and earlier ages, were as much puzzled as  we are by the mythical adventures of their gods. But is there any  known stage of the human intellect in which similar adventures, and  the metamorphoses of men into animals, trees, stars, and all else  that puzzles us in the civilised mythologies, are regarded as possible  incidents of daily human life? Our answer is, that everything in the  civilised mythologies which we regard as irrational seems only part of  the accepted and natural order of things to contemporary savages, and in  the past seemed equally rational and natural to savages concerning whom  we have historical information.(1) Our theory is, therefore, that the  savage and senseless element in mythology is, for the most part, a  legacy from the fancy of ancestors of the civilised races who were once  in an intellectual state not higher, but probably lower, than that of  Australians, Bush-men, Red Indians, the lower races of South America,  and other worse than barbaric peoples. As the ancestors of the Greeks,  Aryans of India, Egyptians and others advanced in civilisation, their  religious thought was shocked and surprised by myths (originally dating  from the period of savagery, and natural in that period, though even  then often in contradiction to morals and religion) which were preserved  down to the time of Pausanias by local priesthoods, or which were  stereotyped in the ancient poems of Hesiod and Homer, or in the  Brahmanas and Vedas of India, or were retained in the popular religion  of Egypt. This theory recommended itself to Lobeck. \"We may believe that  ancient and early tribes framed gods like unto themselves in action and  in experience, and that the allegorical softening down of myths is the  explanation added later by descendants who had attained to purer ideas  of divinity, yet dared not reject the religion of their ancestors.\"(2)  The senseless element in the myths would, by this theory, be for the  most part a \"survival\"; and the age and condition of human thought  whence it survived would be one in which our most ordinary ideas about  the nature of things and the limits of"]]]
