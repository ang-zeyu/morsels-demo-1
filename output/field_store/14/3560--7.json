[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26672"],[0,"Bookbinding, and the Care of Books (#11)"],[1,"joint.\" Broadly speaking, when there are a  great many very thin sections, the thinnest thread may be used; and  coarser thread may be used when the sections are thicker, or fewer in  number. In the case of large manuscripts on vellum it is best to use  very thick silk, or even catgut. Vellum is so tough and durable, that  any binding of a vellum book should be made as if it were expected to  last for hundreds of years.    In selecting the thickness of cord for a book, some judgment is  required. On an old book the bands are best made rather prominent by  the use of thick cord, but the exact thickness to be used is a matter  for taste and experience to decide.    A very thick band on a small book is clumsy, while a very thin band on  the back of a heavy book suggests weakness, and is therefore  unsightly.    In bindings of early printed books and manuscripts an appearance of  great strength is better than extreme neatness.    When the sewing is completed, the cords are cut off close to the lay  cords, and then the keys will be loose enough to be easily removed.  The knots remaining on the lay bands are removed, and the keys slung  through one of them.                                       CHAPTER VIII              Fraying out Slips--Glueing up--Rounding and Backing                         FRAYING OUT SLIPS AND GLUEING UP    After sewing, the book should be looked through to see that all sheets  and plates have been caught by the thread, and special attention  should be given to end papers to see that the sewing lies evenly.    The ends of the cords should next be cut off to within about two  inches of the book on each side, and the free portions frayed out. If  proper sewing cord is used, this will be found to be very easily done,  if a binder's bodkin is first inserted between the two strands,  separating them, and then again in the centre of each separated strand  to still further straighten the fibres (see fig. 34).    The fraying out of the thick cord recommended for heavy books is a  more difficult operation, but with a little trouble the fibres of any  good cord can be frayed out. Vellum or tape bands will only require  cutting off, leaving about two inches free on each side. The free  parts of the bands are called slips.        [Illustration: FIG. 34.]    The book is now ready for glueing up. A piece of waste mill-board or  an old cloth cover is put on each side over the slips, and the book  knocked up squarely at the back and head. Then it is lowered into the  lying press and screwed up, leaving the back with the protecting  boards projecting about three-quarters of an inch. If the back has too  much swelling in it or is spongy, it is better to leave the slips on  one side free and to pull them as tight as possible while the book is  held in the press, or a knocking-down iron may be placed on one side  of the projecting back and the other side tapped with the backing  hammer to make the sections lie close to one another, and then the  slips pulled straight (fig. 35). The back must now be glued. The glue  for this operation must be hot, and not too thick. It is very  important that it should be worked well between the sections with the  brush, and it is well after it has been applied to rub the back with a  finger or folder to make quite sure that the glue goes between every  section for its entire length. If the book is too tightly screwed up  in the press, the glue is apt to remain too much on the surface; and  if not tightly enough, it may penetrate too deeply between the  sections. If the glue is thick, or stringy, it may be diluted with hot  water and the glue-brush rapidly spun round in the glue-pot to break  it up and to make it work freely.        [Illustration: FIG. 35.]    Very great care is needed to see that the head of a previously trimmed  book is knocked up exactly square before the back is glued, for if it  is not, it will be very difficult to get it even afterwards.                               ROUNDING AND BACKING    The amount of rounding on the back of a book should be determined by  the necessities of the case; that is to say, a back that has, through  guarding, or excess of sewing, a tendency to be round, is best not  forced to be flat, and a back that would naturally be flat, is best  not forced to be unduly round. A very round back is objectionable  where it can be avoided, because it takes up so much of the back  margins of the sheets, and is apt to make the book stiff in opening.  On the other hand, a back that is quite flat has to be lined up  stiffly, or it may become concave with use.        [Illustration: FIG. 36.]    The method of rounding is to place the book with the back projecting a  little over the edge of the press or table, then to draw the back over  towards the workman, and, while in this position, to tap it carefully  with a hammer (see fig. 36). This is repeated on the other side of the  book, and, if properly done, will give the back an even, convex form  that should be in section, a portion of a circle. Rounding and backing  are best done after the glue has ceased to be tacky, but before it has  set hard.        [Illustration: FIG. 37.]    Backing is perhaps the most difficult and important operation in  forwarding. The sewing threads in the back cause that part to be  thicker than the rest of the book. Thus in a book with twenty sections  there will be in the back, in addition to the thickness of the paper,  twenty thicknesses of thread.    If the boards were laced on to the book without rounding or backing,  and the book were pressed, the additional thickness of the back,  having to go somewhere, would cause it to go either convex or concave,  or else perhaps to crease up (see fig. 37). The object of rounding is  to control the distribution of this swelling, and to make the back  take an even and permanently convex form.        [Illustration: FIG. 38.]    If the boards were merely laced on after rounding, there would be a  gap between the square ends of the board and the edge of the back (see  fig. 38), though the convexity and even curve of the back would be to  some extent assured. What is done in backing is to make a groove, into  which the edges of the board will fit neatly, and to hammer the backs  of the sections over one another from the centre outwards on both  sides to form the \"groove,\" to ensure that the back shall return to  the same form after the book has been opened.        [Illustration: FIG. 39.]    To back the book, backing boards are placed on each side (leaving the  slips outside) a short distance below the edge of the back (fig. 39).  The amount to leave here must be decided by the thickness of the  boards to be used. When the backing boards are in position, the book  and boards must be carefully lowered into the lying press and screwed  up very tight, great care being taken to see that the boards do not  slip, and that the book is put in evenly. Even the most experienced  forwarder will sometimes have to take a book out of the press two or  three times before he gets it in quite evenly and without allowing the  boards to slip. Unless the back has a perfectly even curve when put in  the press for backing, no amount of subsequent hammering will put it  permanently right.        [Illustration: FIG. 40.]        [Illustration: FIG. 41.]    The backs of the sections should be evenly fanned out one over the  other from the centre outwards on both sides. This is done by side  strokes of the hammer, in fact by a sort of \"riveting\" blow, and not  by a directly crushing blow (see fig. 41, in which the arrows show the  direction of the hammer strokes). If the sections are not evenly  fanned out from the centre, but are either zigzagged by being crushed  by direct blows of the hammer, as shown in fig. 42, A, or are unevenly  fanned over more to one side than the other, as shown in fig. 42, B,  the back, although it may be even enough when first done, will  probably become uneven with use. A book in which the sections have  been crushed down, as at fig. 42, A, will be disfigured inside by  creases in the paper.        [Illustration: FIG. 42.]        [Illustration: FIG. 43.]        [Illustration: FIG. 44.]    It is a mistake to suppose that a very heavy hammer is necessary for  backing any but the largest books. For flexible books a hammer with a  comparatively small face should be used, as by its use the book can be  backed without flattening the bands. It is well to have a hammer head  of the shape shown in fig. 43. By using the thin end, the force of a  comparatively light blow, because concentrated on a small surface, is  effective.    At fig. 44 is shown an ordinary backing hammer.                                        CHAPTER IX           Cutting and Attaching Boards--Cleaning off Back--Pressing                           CUTTING AND ATTACHING BOARDS    The first quality of the best black board made from old rope is the  best to use for \"extra\" binding. It will be found to be very hard, and  not easily broken or bent at the corners. In selecting the thickness  suitable for any given book, the size and thickness of the volume  should be taken into account. The tendency of most modern binders is  to use a rather over thick board, perhaps with a view to bulk out the  volume. For manuscripts, or other books on vellum, it is best to use  wooden boards, which should be clasped. From their stability they form  a kind of permanent press, in which the vellum leaves are kept flat.  In a damp climate like that of England, vellum, absorbing moisture  from the atmosphere, soon cockles up unless it is held tightly in some  way; and when it is once cockled, the book cannot be made to shut  properly, except with very special treatment. Then also dust and damp  have ready access to the interstices of the crinkled pages, resulting  in the disfigurement so well known and so deplored by all lovers of  fine books.

The King did his Petition grant,    And said he lik'd him dearly,  Which gave to _Donald_ more content,    Than Twenty Shillings yearly:        This wily Leard        Rode in the Guard,  And lov'd a strong Beer Barrel;        Yet stout enough,        To Fight and Cuff,  But was not given to Quarrel.    Till on a _Saturday_ at Night,    He walked in the Park, Sir;  And there he kenn'd a well fair Lass,    When it was almost dark, Sir;        Poor _Donald_ he        Drew near to see,  And kist her bonny Mow, Sir;        He laid her flat        Upon her back,  And bang'd her side Weam too, Sir.    He took her by the Lilly white Hand,    And kiss'd his bonny _Mary_,  Then they did to the Tavern go,    Where they did drink Canary;        When he was Drunk,        In came a Punck,  And ask'd gan he would Mow her;        Then he again,        With Might and Main,  Did bravely lay her o'er, Sir.    Poor _Donald_ he rose up again,    As nothing did him ail, Sir;  But little kenn'd this bonny Lass,    Had Fire about her Tail, Sir:        When Night was spent        Then Home he went,  And told it with a Hark, Sir;        How he did Kiss        A dainty Miss,  And lifted up the Sark, Sir.    But e'er a Month had gone about,  Poor _Donald_ walked sadly:  And every yean enquir'd of him,    What gar'd him leuk so badly:        A Wench, quoth he,        Gave Snuff to me,  Out of her Placket box, Sir;        And I am sure,        She prov'd a Whore,  And given to me the Pox, Sir.    Poor _Donald_ he being almost Dead,    Was turn'd out of the Guard, Sir;  And never could get in again,    Although he was a Leard, Sir:        When _Mars_ doth meet,        With _Venus_ sweet,  And struggles to surrender;        The Triumph's lost,        Then never trust  A Feminine Commander.    Poor _Donald_ he went home again,    Because he lost his Place, Sir;  For playing of a Game at Whisk,    And turning up an Ace, Sir;        Ye Soldiers all,        Both great and small,  A Foot-man or a Trooper;        When you behold,        A Wench that's bold  Remember _Donald Cooper_.          _The Jovial Drinker._      [Music]    A Pox on those Fools, who exclaim against Wine,    And fly the dear sweets that the Bottle doth bring;  It heightens the Fancy, the Wit does refine,    And he that was first Drunk was made the first King.    By the help of good Claret old Age becomes Youth,    And sick Men still find this the only Physitian;  Drink largely, you'll know by experience, the Truth,    That he that drinks most is the best Politician.    To Victory this leads on the brave Cavalier,    And makes all the Terrors of War, but Delight;  This flushes his Courage, and beats off base Fear,    'Twas that taught _Caesar_ and _Pompey_ to fight.    This supports all our Friends, and knocks down our Foes,    This makes us all Loyal Men from Courtier to Clown;  Like _Dutchmen_ from Brandy, from this our Strength grows    So 'tis Wine, noble Wine, that's a Friend to the Crown.          _The Sexton's_ SONG.    _Sung by_ BEN.

[Music]    My Friend if you would understand,    My Fortunes what they are;  I once had Cattle House and Land,    But now I am never the near:  My Father left a good Estate,    As I may tell to thee;  I couzened was of all I had,    _Like a great Boobee_.    I went to School with a good intent,    And for to learn my Book;  And all the Day I went to play,    In it I never did look:  Full seven Years, or very nigh,    As I may tell to thee;  I could hardly say my Criss-Cross-Row,    _Like a great Boobee_.    My Father then in all the hast,    Did set me to the Plow;  And for to lash the Horse about,    Indeed I knew not how:  My Father took his Whip in Hand,    And soundly lashed me;  He called me Fool and Country Clown,    _And a great Boobee_.    But I did from my Father run,    For I would Plow no more;  Because he had so lashed me,    And made my sides so sore:  But I will go to _London_ Town,    Some Fashions for to see;  When I came there they call'd me Clown,    _And a great Boobee_.    But as I went along the Street,    I carried my Hat in my Hand,  And to every one that I did meet,    I bravely Buss'd my Hand:  Some did laugh, and some did scoff,    And some did mock at me;  And some did say I was a Woodcock,    _And a great Boobee_.    Then I did walk in hast to _Paul's_    The Steeple for to view;  Because I heard some People say,    It should be builded new;  Then I got up unto the Top,    The City for to see;  It was so high it made me cry,    _Like a great Boobee_.    From thence I went to _Westminster_,    And for to see the Tombs:  Oh, said I, what a House is here,    With an infinite sight of Rooms:  Sweetly the Abby Bells did Ring,    It was a fine sight to see;  Methought I was going to Heav'n in a String,    _Like a great Boobee_.    But as I went along the Street,    The most part of the Day;  Many Gallants I did meet,    Methought they were very gay:  I blew my Nose and pist my Hose,    Some People did me see:  They said I was a Beastly Fool:    _And a great Boobee_.    Next Day I thro' _Pye-corner_ past,    The Roast-meat on the Stall;  Invited me to take a Taste,    My Money was but small:  The Meat I pickt, the Cook me kickt,    As I may tell to thee;  He beat me sore and made me roar,    _Like a great Boobee_.    As I thro' _Smithfield_ lately walkt,    A gallant Lass I met:  Familiarly with me she talk't,    Which I cannot forget:  She proferr'd me a Pint of Wine,    Methought she was wondrous free,  To the Tavern then I went with her,    _Like a great Boobee_.    She told me we were near of Kin,    And call'd for Wine good store;  Before the Reckoning was brought in,    My Cousin prov'd a Whore:  My Purse she pickt, and went away,    My Cousin couzened me,  The Vintner kickt me out of Door;    _Like a great Boobee_.    At the _Exchange_ when I came there,    I saw most gallant things;  I thought the Pictures living were,    Of all our English Kings:  I doft my Hat and made a Leg,    And kneeled on my Knee;  The People laugh'd and call'd me Fool,    _And a great Boobee_.    To _Paris-Garden_ then I went,    Where there is great resort;  My Pleasure was my Punishment,    I did not like the Sport:  The Garden-Bull with his stout Horns,    On high then tossed me;  I did bewray my self with fear,    _Like a great Boobee_.    The Bearward went to save me then,    The People flock'd about;  I told the Bear-Garden-Men,    My Guts they were almost out:  They said I stunk most grievously,    No Man would pity me;  They call'd me witless Fool and Ass,    _And a great Boobee_.    Then o'er the water I did pass,    As you shall understand;  I dropt into the Thames, alass,    Before I came to Land:  The Waterman did help me out,    And thus did say to me;  'Tis not thy fortune to be drown'd,    _Like a great Boobee_.    But I have learned so much Wit,    Shall shorten all my Cares;  If I can but a Licence get,    To play before the Bears:  'Twould be a gallant Place indeed,    As I may tell to thee:  Then who dares call me Fool or Ass,    _Or great Boobee_.          _Set by Mr._ Jeremiah Clark,    _Sung by Mr._ LEVERIDGE.
