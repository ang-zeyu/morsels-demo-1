Because this water clock uses wheels and strikes bells one must    reject the evidence of literary reference, such as by Dante,    from which the mention of wheels and bells have been taken as    positive proof of the existence of mechanical clocks with    mechanical escapements. The to-and-fro motion of the mechanical    clock escapement is quite an impressive feature, but there    seems to be no literary reference to it before the time of de    Dondi.

A loud shout of laughter followed, and Lord  Mansfield leaned back to enjoy it, and then gravely leaned forward and  asked if Mr. Dunning had any more questions to put to the witness. No  answer was given, and none were put. The same counsel, when at the  height of his large practice at the Bar, was asked how he got through  all his work. He replied: \"I do one-third of it; another third does  itself; and I don't do the remaining third.\"    A witness under severe cross-examination by Serjeant Dunning was  repeatedly asked if he did not live close to the Court. On admitting  that he did, the further question was put, \"And pray, sir, for what  reason did you take up your residence in that place?\"--\"To avoid the  rascally impertinence of dunning,\" came the ready answer.    A barrister's name once gave a witness the opportunity to score in the  course of a severe cross-examination. Missing was the leader of his  Circuit and was defending his client charged with stealing a donkey. The  prosecutor had left the donkey tied up to a gate, and when he returned  it was gone. \"Do you mean to say,\" said counsel, \"the donkey was stolen  from the gate?\"--\"I mean to say, sir,\" said the witness, giving the  judge and then the jury a sly look, at the same time pointing to the  counsel, \"the ass was missing.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Clarke, a leader of the Midland Circuit, was a very worthy lawyer of  the old school. A client long refusing to agree to refer to arbitration  a cause which judge, jury, and counsel wished to get rid of, he at last  said to him, \"You d--d infernal fool, if you do not immediately follow  his lordship's recommendation, I shall be obliged to use strong language  to you.\" Once, in a council of the Benchers of Lincoln's Inn, the same  gentleman very conscientiously opposed their calling a Jew to the Bar.  Some tried to point out the hardship to be imposed upon the young  gentleman, who had been allowed to keep his terms, and whose prospects  in life would thus be suddenly blasted. \"Hardship!\" said the zealous  churchman, \"no hardship at all! Let him become a Christian, and be d--d  to him!\"    It is sometimes imagined by laymen that verdicts may be obtained by the  trickery of counsel. Doubtless counsel may try to throw dust in the  eyes of jurors, but they are not very successful. Lord Campbell tells a  story of Clarke, who by such tactics brought a case to a satisfactory  compromise. The attorney, coming to him privately, said, \"Sir, don't you  think we have got very good terms? But you rather went beyond my  instructions.\"--\"You fool!\" retorted Clarke; \"how do you suppose you  could have got such terms if I had stuck to your instructions.\"    [Illustration: JOHN ADOLPHUS, BARRISTER.]    In the biography of John Adolphus, a famous criminal lawyer, we are told  that the judges of his time were much impressed with the following table  of degrees. \"The three degrees of comparison in a lawyer's progress are:  getting on; getting on-er (honour); getting on-est (honest).\" He  declared the judges acknowledged much truth in the degrees. The third  degree in Mr. Adolphus' table reminds us of the story of the farmer who  was met by the head of a firm of solicitors, who inquired the name of a  plant the farmer was carrying. \"It's a plant,\" replied the latter, \"that  will not grow in a lawyer's garden; it is called honesty.\"    One night, walking through St. Giles's by way of a short cut towards  home, an Irish woman came up to Mr. Adolphus. \"Why, Misther Adolphus!  and who'd a' thought of seeing you in the Holy Ground?\"--\"And how came  you to know who I am?\" said Adolphus. \"Lord bless and save ye, sir!  not know ye? Why, I'd know ye if ye was boiled up in a soup!\"    Mr. Montagu Chambers was counsel for a widow who had been put in a  lunatic asylum, and sued the two medical men who signed the certificate  of her insanity. The plaintiff's case was to prove that she was not  addicted to drinking, and that there was no pretence for treating hers  as a case of _delirium tremens_. Dr. Tunstal, the last of plaintiff's  witnesses, described one case in which he had cured a patient of  _delirium tremens_ in a _single night_, and he added, \"It was a case of  gradual drinking, _sipping all day_ from morning till night.\" These  words were scarcely uttered when Mr. Chambers rose in triumph, and said,  \"My lord, that is _my case_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    On the Northern Circuit a century ago, there was a famous barrister who  was familiarly known among his brother advocates as Jack Lee. He was  engaged in examining one Mary Pritchard, of Barnsley, and began his  examination with, \"Well, Mary, if I may credit what I hear, I may  venture to address you by the name of Black Moll.\"--\"Faith you may,  mister lawyer, for I am always called so by the blackguards.\" On another  occasion he was retained for the plaintiff in an action for breach of  promise of marriage. When the consultation took place, he inquired  whether the lady for whose injury he was to seek redress was  good-looking. \"Very handsome indeed, sir,\" was the assurance of her  attorney. \"Then, sir,\" replied Lee, \"I beg you will request her to be in  Court, and in a place where she can be seen.\" The attorney promised  compliance, and the lady, in accordance with Lee's wishes, took her seat  in a conspicuous place, where the jury could see her. Lee, in addressing  the jury, did not fail to insist with great warmth on the \"abominable  cruelty\" which had been exercised towards \"the highly attractive and  modest girl who trusted her cause to their discernment\"; and did not sit  down until he had succeeded in working upon their feelings with great  and, as he thought, successful effect. The counsel on the other side,  however, speedily broke the spell with which Lee had enchanted the jury,  by observing that \"his learned friend, in describing the graces and  beauty of the plaintiff, ought in common fairness not to have concealed  from the jury the fact that the lady had a _wooden leg_!\" The Court was  convulsed with laughter at this discovery, while Lee, who was ignorant  of this circumstance, looked aghast; and the jury, ashamed of the  influence that mere eloquence had had upon them, returned a verdict for  the defendant.    Justice Willes, the son of Chief Justice Willes, had an offensive habit  of interrupting counsel. On one occasion an old practitioner was so  irritated by this practice that he retorted sharply by saying, \"Your  lordship doubtless shows greater acuteness even than your father, the  Chief Justice, for he used to understand me _after I had done_, but your  lordship understands me even _before I have begun_.\"    Of Whigham, a later leader on the Northern Circuit, an amusing story  used to be told. He was defending a prisoner, and opened an alibi in his  address to the jury, undertaking to prove it by calling the person who  had been in bed with his client at the time in question, and deprecating  their evil opinion of a woman whose moral character was clearly open to  grave reproach, but who was still entitled to be believed upon her oath.  Then he called \"Jessie Crabtree.\" The name was, as usual, repeated by  the crier, and there came pushing his way sturdily through the crowd a  big Lancashire lad in his rough dress, who had been the prisoner's  veritable bedfellow--Whigham's brief not having explained to him that  the Christian name of his witness was, in this case, a male one.    Colman, in his _Random Records_, tells the following anecdote of the  witty barrister, Mr. Jekyll. One day observing a squirrel in Colman's  chambers, in the usual round cage, performing the same operation as a  man in a tread-mill, and looking at it for a minute, exclaimed, \"Oh!  poor devil, he's going the Home Circuit.\"    Jekyll was asked why he no longer spoke to a lawyer named Peat; to which  he replied, \"I choose to give up his acquaintance--I have common of  turbary, and have a right to cut _peat_!\" An impromptu of his on a  learned serjeant who was holding the Court of Common Pleas with his  glittering eye, is well known:        \"Behold the serjeant full of fire,        Long shall his hearers rue it,      His purple garments _came_ from Tyre,        His arguments _go to it_.\"    Mr. H. L. Adam, in his volume _The Story of Crime_, tells an amusing  story of a prisoner whose counsel had successfully obtained his  acquittal on a charge of brutal assault. A policeman came across a man  one night lying unconscious on the pavement, and near by him was an  ordinary \"bowler\" hat. That was the only clue to the perpetrator of the  deed. The police had their suspicions of a certain individual, whom they  proceeded to interrogate. In addition to being unable to give a  satisfactory account of his movements on the night of the assault, it  was found that the \"bowler\" hat in question fitted him like a glove. He  was accordingly arrested and charged with the crime, the hat being the  chief evidence against him. Counsel for the defence, however, dwelt so  impressively on the risk of accepting such evidence that the jury  brought in a verdict of \"not proven,\" and the prisoner was discharged.  Before leaving the dock he turned to the judge, and pointing to the  hat in Court, said, \"My lord, may I 'ave my 'at.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Some amusing scenes have occurred in suits brought by tailors and  dressmakers to recover the price of garments for which their customers  have declined to pay on the ground of misfit. Serjeant Ballantine, in  his _Experiences of a Barrister_, relates the case of a tailor in which  the defendant was the famous Sir Edwin Landseer. It was tried in the  Exchequer Court, before Baron Martin. \"The coat was produced,\""]]]
