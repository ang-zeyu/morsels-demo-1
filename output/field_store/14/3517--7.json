Say  How can my care thy grace repay.\"  Envoy of Him whom all adore  Thus to the king he spake once more:  \"The Gods accept thy worship: they  Give thee the blessed fruit to-day.  Approach and take, O glorious King,  This heavenly nectar which I bring,  For it shall give thee sons and wealth,  And bless thee with a store of health.  Give it to those fair queens of thine,  And bid them quaff the drink divine:  And they the princely sons shall bear  Long sought by sacrifice and prayer.\"      \"Yea, O my lord,\" the monarch said,  And took the vase upon his head,  The gift of Gods, of fine gold wrought,  With store of heavenly liquor fraught.  He honoured, filled with transport new,  That wondrous being, fair to view,  As round the envoy of the God  With reverential steps he trod.(110)  His errand done, that form of light  Arose and vanished from the sight.  High rapture filled the monarch's soul,  Possessed of that celestial bowl,  As when a man by want distressed  With unexpected wealth is blest.  And rays of transport seemed to fall  Illuminating bower and hall,  As when the autumn moon rides high,  And floods with lovely light the sky.  Quick to the ladies' bower he sped,  And thus to Queen Kausalya said:  \"This genial nectar take and quaff,\"  He spoke, and gave the lady half.  Part of the nectar that remained  Sumitra from his hand obtained.  He gave, to make her fruitful too,  Kaikeyi half the residue.  A portion yet remaining there,    He paused awhile to think.  Then gave Sumitra, with her share.    The remnant of the drink.  Thus on each queen of those fair three    A part the king bestowed,  And with sweet hope a child to see    Their yearning bosoms glowed.  The heavenly bowl the king supplied    Their longing souls relieved,  And soon, with rapture and with pride,    Each royal dame conceived.  He gazed upon each lady's face,    And triumphed as he gazed,  As Indra in his royal place    By Gods and spirits praised.          Canto XVI. The Vanars.      When Vishnu thus had gone on earth,  From the great king to take his birth,  The self-existent Lord of all  Addressed the Gods who heard his call:  \"For Vishnu's sake, the strong and true,  Who seeks the good of all of you,  Make helps, in war to lend him aid,  In forms that change at will, arrayed,  Of wizard skill and hero might,  Outstrippers of the wind in flight,  Skilled in the arts of counsel, wise,  And Vishnu's peers in bold emprise;  With heavenly arts and prudence fraught,  By no devices to be caught;  Skilled in all weapon's lore and use  As they who drink the immortal juice.(111)  And let the nymphs supreme in grace,  And maidens of the minstrel race,  Monkeys and snakes, and those who rove  Free spirits of the hill and grove,  And wandering Daughters of the Air,  In monkey form brave children bear.  So erst the lord of bears I shaped,  Born from my mouth as wide I gaped.\"      Thus by the mighty Sire addressed  They all obeyed his high behest,  And thus begot in countless swarms  Brave sons disguised in sylvan forms.  Each God, each sage became a sire,  Each minstrel of the heavenly quire,(112)  Each faun,(113) of children strong and good  Whose feet should roam the hill and wood.  Snakes, bards,(114) and spirits,(115) serpents bold  Had sons too numerous to be told.  Bali, the woodland hosts who led,  High as Mahendra's(116) lofty head,  Was Indra's child. That noblest fire,  The Sun, was great Sugriva's sire,  Tara, the mighty monkey, he  Was offspring of Vrihaspati:(117)  Tara the matchless chieftain, boast  For wisdom of the Vanar host.  Of Gandhamadan brave and bold  The father was the Lord of Gold.  Nala the mighty, dear to fame,  Of skilful Visvakarma(118) came.  From Agni,(119) Nila bright as flame,  Who in his splendour, might, and worth,  Surpassed the sire who gave him birth.  The heavenly Asvins,(120) swift and fair,  Were fathers of a noble pair,  Who, Dwivida and Mainda named,  For beauty like their sires were famed,  Varun(121) was father of Sushen,  Of Sarabh, he who sends the rain,(122)  Hanuman, best of monkey kind,  Was son of him who breathes the wind:  Like thunderbolt in frame was he,  And swift as Garud's(123) self could flee.  These thousands did the Gods create  Endowed with might that none could mate,  In monkey forms that changed at will;  So strong their wish the fiend to kill.  In mountain size, like lions thewed,  Up sprang the wondrous multitude,  Auxiliar hosts in every shape,  Monkey and bear and highland ape.  In each the strength, the might, the mien  Of his own parent God were seen.  Some chiefs of Vanar mothers came,  Some of she-bear and minstrel dame,  Skilled in all arms in battle's shock;  The brandished tree, the loosened rock;  And prompt, should other weapons fail,  To fight and slay with tooth and nail.  Their strength could shake the hills amain,  And rend the rooted trees in twain,  Disturb with their impetuous sweep  The Rivers' Lord, the Ocean deep,  Rend with their feet the seated ground,  And pass wide floods with airy bound,  Or forcing through the sky their way  The very clouds by force could stay.  Mad elephants that wander through  The forest wilds, could they subdue,  And with their furious shout could scare  Dead upon earth the birds of air.  So were the sylvan chieftains formed;  Thousands on thousands still they swarmed.  These were the leaders honoured most,  The captains of the Vanar host,  And to each lord and chief and guide  Was monkey offspring born beside.  Then by the bears' great monarch stood  The other roamers of the wood,  And turned, their pathless homes to seek,  To forest and to mountain peak.  The leaders of the monkey band  By the two brothers took their stand,  Sugriva, offspring of the Sun  And Bali, Indra's mighty one.  They both endowed with Garud's might,  And skilled in all the arts of fight,  Wandered in arms the forest through,  And lions, snakes, and tigers, slew.  But every monkey, ape, and bear  Ever was Bali's special care;  With his vast strength and mighty arm  He kept them from all scathe and harm.  And so the earth with hill, wood, seas,  Was filled with mighty ones like these,  Of various shape and race and kind,  With proper homes to each assigned,  With Rama's champions fierce and strong    The earth was overspread,  High as the hills and clouds, a throng    With bodies vast and dread.(124)          Canto XVII. Rishyasring's Return.      Now when the high-souled monarch's rite,  The Asvamedh, was finished quite,  Their sacrificial dues obtained,  The Gods their heavenly homes regained.  The lofty-minded saints withdrew,  Each to his place, with honour due,  And kings and chieftains, one and all,  Who came to grace the festival.  And Dasaratha, ere they went,  Addressed them thus benevolent:  \"Now may you, each with joyful heart,  To your own realms, O Kings, depart.  Peace and good luck attend you there,  And blessing, is my friendly prayer;  Let cares of state each mind engage  To guard his royal heritage.  A monarch from his throne expelled  No better than the dead is held.  So he who cares for power and might  Must guard his realm and royal right.  Such care a meed in heaven will bring  Better than rites and offering.  Such care a king his country owes  As man upon himself bestows,  When for his body he provides  Raiment and every need besides.  For future days should kings foresee,  And keep the present error-free.\"      Thus did the king the kings exhort:  They heard, and turned them from the court  And, each to each in friendship bound,  Went forth to all the realms around.  The rites were o'er, the guests were sped:  The train the best of Brahmans led,  In which the king with joyful soul,  With his dear wives, and with the whole  Of his imperial host and train  Of cars and servants turned again,  And, as a monarch dear to fame,  Within his royal city came.      Next, Rishyasring, well-honoured sage,  And Santa, sought their hermitage.  The king himself, of prudent mind,  Attended him, with troops behind.  And all her men the town outpoured  With Saint Vasishtha and their lord.  High mounted on a car of state,  O'er canopied fair Santa sate.  Drawn by white oxen, while a band  Of servants marched on either hand.  Great gifts of countless price she bore,  With sheep and goats and gems in store.  Like Beauty's self the lady shone  With all the jewels she had on,  As, happy in her sweet content,  Peerless amid the fair she went.  Not Queen Paulomi's(125) self could be  More loving to her lord than she.  She who had lived in happy ease,  Honoured with all her heart could please,  While dames and kinsfolk ever vied  To see her wishes gratified,  Soon as she knew her husband's will  Again to seek the forest, still  Was ready for the hermit's cot,  Nor murmured at her altered lot.  The king attended to the wild  That hermit and his own dear child,  And in the centre of a throng  Of noble courtiers rode along.  The sage's son had let prepare  A lodge within the wood, and there  While they lingered blithe and gay.  Then, duly honoured, went their way.  The glorious hermit Rishyasring  Drew near and thus besought the king:      \"Return, my honoured lord, I pray,  Return, upon thy homeward way.\"  The monarch, with the waiting crowd,  Lifted his voice and wept aloud,  And with eyes dripping still to each  Of his good queens he spake this speech:      \"Kausalya and Sumitra dear,  And thou, my sweet Kaikeyi, hear.  All upon Santa feast your gaze,  The last time for a length of days.\"  To Santa's arms the ladies leapt,  And hung about her neck and wept,  And cried, \"O, happy be the life  Of this great Brahman and his wife.  The Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high,  The Earth, the Streams, the circling Sky,  Preserve thee in the wood, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#11)"],[1,"be the very lad for the business.    Mr. Carroll came at last, and we all went down to meet him at the  gate. Ned Brooke also came shuffling along to take the horse, and Mr.  Carroll tossed the reins to him and at the same time handed a  pocketbook to his wife.    \"Just as well to be careful where you put that,\" he said laughingly.  \"There's a sum in it not to be picked up on every gooseberry bush.  Gilman Harris paid me this morning for that bit of woodland I sold him  last fall--five hundred dollars. I promised that you and the girls  should have it to get a new piano, so there it is for you.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Carroll delightedly. \"However, you'd better put  it back in your pocket till we go in. Amy is in a hurry.\"    Mr. Carroll took back the pocketbook and dropped it carelessly into  the inside pocket of the light overcoat that he wore.    I happened to glance at Ned Brooke just then, and I could not help  noticing the sudden crafty, eager expression that flashed over his  face. He eyed the pocketbook in Mr. Carroll's hands furtively, after  which he went off with the horse in a great hurry.    The girls were exclaiming and thanking their father, and nobody  noticed Ned Brooke's behaviour but myself, and it soon passed out of  my mind.    \"Come to take the place, are you, Amy?\" said Mr. Carroll. \"Well,  everything is ready, I think. I suppose we'd better proceed. Where  shall we stand? You had better group us as you think best.\"    Whereupon I proceeded to arrange them in due order under the maple.  Mrs. Carroll sat in a chair, while her husband stood behind her.  Gertie stood on the steps with a basket of flowers in her hand, and  Lilian was at one side. The two little boys, Teddy and Jack, climbed  up into the maple, and little Dora, the dimpled six-year-old, stood  gravely in the foreground with an enormous grey cat hugged in her  chubby arms.    It was a pretty group in a pretty setting, and I thrilled with  professional pride as I stepped back for a final, knowing squint at it  all. Then I went to my camera, slipped in the plate, gave them due  warning and took off the cap.    I took two plates to make sure and then the thing was over, but as I  had another plate left I thought I might as well take a view of the  house by itself, so I carried my camera to a new place and had just  got everything ready to lift the cap when Mr. Carroll came down and  said:    \"If you girls want to see something pretty, come to the back field  with me. That will wait till you come back, won't it, Amy?\"    So we all betook ourselves to the back field, a short distance away,  where Mr. Carroll proudly displayed two of the prettiest little Jersey  cows I had ever seen.    We returned to the house by way of the back lane and, as we came in  sight of the main road, my brother Cecil drove up and said that if I  were ready, I had better go home with him and save myself a hot, dusty  walk.    The Carrolls all went down to the fence to speak to Cecil, but I  dashed hurriedly down through the orchard, leaped over the fence into  the lawn and ran to the somewhat remote corner where I had left my  camera. I was in a desperate hurry, for I knew Cecil's horse did not  like to be kept waiting, so I never even glanced at the house, but  snatched off the cap, counted two and replaced it.    Then I took out my plate, put it in the holder and gathered up my  traps. I suppose I was about five minutes at it all and I had my back  to the house the whole time, and when I laid all my things ready and  emerged from my retreat, there was nobody to be seen about the place.    As I hurried up through the lawn, I noticed Ned Brooke walking at a  smart pace down the lane, but the fact did not make any particular  impression on me at the time, and was not recalled until afterwards.    Cecil was waiting for me, so I got in the buggy and we drove off. On  arriving home I shut myself up in my dark room and proceeded to  develop the first two negatives of the Carroll housestead. They were  both excellent, the first one being a trifle the better, so that I  decided to finish from it. I intended also to develop the third, but  just as I finished the others, a half-dozen city cousins swooped down  upon us and I had to put away my paraphernalia, emerge from my dark  retreat and fly around to entertain them.    The next day Cecil came in and said:    \"Did you hear, Amy, that Mr. Carroll has lost a pocketbook with five  hundred dollars in it?\"    \"No!\" I exclaimed. \"How? When? Where?\"    \"Don't overwhelm a fellow. I can answer only one question--last night.  As to the 'how,' they don't know, and as to the 'where'--well, if they  knew that, there might be some hope of finding it. The girls are in a  bad way. The money was to get them their longed-for piano, it seems,  and now it's gone.\"    \"But how did it happen, Cecil?\"    \"Well, Mr. Carroll says that Mrs. Carroll handed the pocketbook back  to him at the gate yesterday, and he dropped it in the inside pocket  of his over-coat--\"    \"I saw him do it,\" I cried.    \"Yes, and then, before he went to be photographed, he hung his coat up  in the hall. It hung there until the evening, and nobody seems to have  thought about the money, each supposing that someone else had put it  carefully away. After tea Mr. Carroll put on the coat and went to see  somebody over at Netherby. He says the thought of the pocketbook never  crossed his mind; he had forgotten all about putting it in that coat  pocket. He came home across the fields about eleven o'clock and found  that the cows had broken into the clover hay, and he had a great chase  before he got them out. When he went in, just as he entered the door,  the remembrance of the money flashed over him. He felt in his pocket,  but there was no pocketbook there; he asked his wife if she had taken  it out. She had not, and nobody else had. There was a hole in the  pocket, but Mr. Carroll says it was too small for the pocketbook to  have worked through. However, it must have done so--unless someone  took it out of his pocket at Netherby, and that is not possible,  because he never had his coat off, and it was in an inside pocket.  It's not likely that they will ever see it again. Someone may pick it  up, of course, but the chances are slim. Mr. Carroll doesn't know his  exact path across the fields, and if he lost it while he was after the  cows, it's a bluer show still. They've been searching all day, of  course. The girls are awfully disappointed.\"    A sudden recollection came to me of Ned Brooke's face as I had seen it  the day before at the gate, coupled with the remembrance of seeing him  walking down the lane at a quick pace, so unlike his usual shambling  gait, while I ran through the lawn.    \"How do they know it was lost?\" I said. \"Perhaps it was stolen before  Mr. Carroll went to Netherby.\"    \"They think not,\" said Cecil. \"Who would have stolen it?\"    \"Ned Brooke. I saw him hanging around. And you never saw such a look  as came over his face when he heard Mr. Carroll say there was five  hundred dollars in that pocketbook.\"    \"Well, I did suggest to them that Ned might know something about it,  for I remembered having seen him go down the lane while I was waiting  for you, but they won't hear of such a thing. The Brookes are kind of  proteges of theirs, you know, and they won't believe anything bad of  them. If Ned did take it, however, there's not a shadow of evidence  against him.\"    \"No, I suppose not,\" I answered thoughtfully, \"but the more I think it  over, the more I'm convinced that he took it. You know, we all went to  the back field to look at the Jerseys, and all that time the coat was  hanging there in the hall, and not a soul in the house. And it was  just after we came back that I saw Ned scuttling down the lane so  fast.\"    I mentioned my suspicions to the Carrolls a few days afterwards, when  I went down with the photographs, and found that they had discovered  no trace of the lost pocketbook. But they seemed positively angry when  I hinted that Ned Brooke might know more about its whereabouts than  anyone else. They declared that they would as soon think of suspecting  one of themselves as Ned, and altogether they seemed so offended at my  suggestion that I held my peace and didn't irritate them by any more  suppositions.    Afterwards, in the excitement of our cousins' visit, the matter passed  out of my mind completely. They stayed two weeks, and I was so busy  the whole time that I never got a chance to develop that third plate  and, in fact, I had forgotten all about it.    One morning soon after they went away, I remembered the plate and  decided to go and develop it. Cecil went with me, and we shut  ourselves up in our den, lit our ruby lantern and began operations. I  did not expect much of the plate, because it had been exposed and  handled carelessly, and I thought that it might prove to be  underexposed or light-struck. So I left Cecil to develop it while I  prepared the fixing bath. Cecil was whistling away when suddenly he  gave a tremendous \"whew\" of astonishment and sprang to his feet.    \"Amy, Amy, look here!\" he cried.    I rushed to his side and looked at the plate as he held it up in the  rosy light. It was a splendid one, and the Carroll house came out  clear, with the front door and the steps in full view.    And there, just in the act of stepping from the threshold, was the  figure of a boy with an old straw hat on his head and--in his  hand--the pocketbook!    He was standing with his head turned towards the corner of the house  as if listening, with one hand holding his ragged coat open and the  other poised in mid-air with the pocketbook, as if he were just going  to put it in his inside pocket. The whole scene was as clear as  noonday, and nobody with eyes in his head could have failed to  recognize Ned Brooke.    \"Goodness!\" I gasped. \"In with it--quick!\"    And we doused the thing into the fixing bath and"]]]
