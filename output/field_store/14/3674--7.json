[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#11)"],[1,", and sugar, and  a single can of peaches. Of course there was game. Now if we had found  ourselves confined to meat, mush, oatmeal pones, and tea, we should,  after a little, have felt ourselves reduced to dull monotony, and after  a little more we should have begun to long mightily for the fleshpots of  Deadwood. But that can of peaches lurked in the back of our minds. By  its presence we were _not_ reduced to meat, mush, oatmeal pones, and  tea. Occasionally we would discuss gravely the advisability of opening  it, but I do not believe any one of us down deep in his heart meant it  in sober earnest. What was the mere tickling of the palate compared with  the destruction of a symbol.    [Sidenote: Take Your Pet Luxury]    Somewhat similarly I was once on a trip with an Englishman who, when we  outfitted, insisted on marmalade. In vain we pointed out the fact that  glass always broke. Finally we compromised on one jar, which we wrapped  in the dish towel and packed in the coffee pot. For five weeks that  unopened jar of marmalade traveled with us, and the Englishman was  content. Then it got broken--as they always do. From that time on our  friend uttered his daily growl or lament over the lack of marmalade.  And, mind you, he had already gone five weeks without tasting a  spoonful!    So include in the list your pet luxury. Tell yourself that you will eat  it just at the psychological moment. It is a great comfort. But to our  list:    _Bacon_ is the stand-by. Get the very best you can buy, and the leanest.  In a walking trip cut off the rind in order to reduce the weight.    _Ham_ is a pleasant variety if you have room for it.    [Sidenote: Cereals]    _Flour._--Personally I like the whole wheat best. It bakes easier than  the white, has more taste, and mixes with other things quite as well. It  comes in 10-pound sacks, which makes it handy to carry.    _Pancake Flour_, either buckwheat or not, makes flapjacks, of course,  but also bakes into excellent loaves, and is a fine base for camp cake.    _Boston Brown Bread Flour_ is self-rising, on the principle of the  flapjack flour. It makes genuine brown bread, toothsome quick biscuits  with shortening, and a glorious boiled or steamed pudding. If your  outfitter does not know of it, tell him it is made at San Jose,  California.    _Cornmeal._--Get the yellow. It makes good Johnny cake, puddings, fried  mush, and unleavened corn pone, all of which are palatable, nourishing,  and easy to make. If you have a dog with you, it is the easiest ration  for between-meat seasons. A quarter cup swells up into an abundant meal  for the average-sized canine.    _Hominy._--The coarse sort makes a good variety.    _Tapioca._--Utterly unsatisfactory over an open fire. Don't take it.    [Sidenote: Rice, the Ideal Stand-by]    _Rice._--I think rice is about the best stand-by of all. In the first  place, ten pounds of rice will go farther than ten pounds of any other  food; a half cup, which weighs small for its bulk, boils up into a half  kettleful, a quantity ample for four people. In the second place, it  contains a great percentage of nutriment, and is good stuff to travel  on. In the third place, it is of that sort of palatability of which one  does not tire. In the fourth place it can be served in a variety of  ways: boiled plain; boiled with raisins; boiled with rolled oats;  boiled, then fried; made into baked puddings; baked in gems or loaves;  mixed with flapjacks. Never omit it from your list.    [Illustration: When you quit the trail for a day's rest]    [Sidenote: Buy Only the Best Brands]    _Baking Powder._--Do not buy an unknown brand at a country store; you  will find it bad for your insides after a very short use. Royal and  Price's are both good.    _Tea and Coffee._--Even confirmed coffee drinkers drop away from their  allegiance after being out a short time. Tea seems to wear better in the  woods. Personally, I never take coffee at all, unless for the benefit of  some other member of the party.    _Potatoes_ are generally out of the question, although you can often  stick a small sack in your kyacks. They are very grateful when you can  carry them. A desiccated article is on the market. Soaked up it takes on  somewhat the consistency of rather watery mashed potatoes. It is not  bad.    _Onions_ are a luxury; but, like the potatoes, can sometimes be taken,  and add largely to flavor.    [Sidenote: Saccharine Tablets]    _Sugar._--My experience is, that one eats a great deal more sweets out  of doors than at home. I suppose one uses up more fuel. In any case I  have many a time run out of sugar, and only rarely brought any home  Saxin, crystallose and saccharine are all excellent to relieve the  weight in this respect. They come as tablets, each a little larger than  the head of a pin. A tablet represents the sweetening power of a lump of  sugar. Dropped in the tea, two of them will sweeten quite as well as two  heaping spoonfuls and you could never tell the difference. A man could  carry in his waistcoat pocket vials containing the equivalent of  twenty-five pounds of sugar. Their advantage in lightening a back load  is obvious.    _Fats._--Lard is the poorest and least wholesome. Cottolene is better.  Olive oil is best. The latter can be carried in a screw-top tin. Less of  it need be used than of the others. It gives a delicious flavor to  anything fried in it.    _Mush._--Rolled oats are good, but do not agree with some people. Cream  of Wheat and Germea are more digestible. Personally I prefer to take my  cereal in the form of biscuits. It \"sticks to the ribs\" better.  Three-quarters of a cup of cereal will make a full supply of mush for  three people, leaving room for mighty little else. On the other hand, a  full cup of the same cereal will make six biscuits--two apiece for our  three people. In other words, the biscuits allow one to eat a third more  cereal in half the bulk.    [Sidenote: Fruits]    _Dried Fruit._--This is another class of food almost to be classed as  condensed. It is easily carried, is light, and when cooked swells  considerably. Raisins lead the list, as they cook in well with any of  the flour stuffs and rice, and are excellent to eat raw as a lunch.  Dried figs come next. I do not mean the layer figs, but those dried  round like prunes. They can be stewed, eaten raw, or cooked in puddings.  Dried apples are good stewed, or soaked and fried in a little sugar.  Prunes are available, raw or cooked. Peaches and apricots I do not care  for, but they complete the list.    [Sidenote: A Good Remedy for a Chill]    _Salt and Pepper._--A little cayenne in hot water is better than whiskey  for a chill.    _Cinnamon._--Excellent to sprinkle on apples, rice, and puddings. A  flavoring to camp cake. One small box will last a season.    _Milk._--Some people like the sticky sweetened Borden milk. I think it  very sickish and should much prefer to go without. The different brands  of evaporated creams are palatable, but too bulky and heavy for ordinary  methods of transportation. A can or so may sometimes be included,  however. Abercrombie & Fitch offer a milk powder. They claim that a  spoonful in water \"produces a sweet wholesome milk.\" It may be  wholesome; it certainly is sweet--but as for being milk! I should like  to see the cow that would acknowledge it.    _Syrup._--Mighty good on flapjacks and bread, and sometimes to be  carried when animals are many. The easiest to get that tastes like  anything is the \"Log Cabin\" maple syrup. It comes in a can of a handy  shape.    [Sidenote: Altitude's Influence on Cooking]    _Beans._--Another rich stand-by; rich in sustenance, light in weight,  and compressed in bulk. Useless to carry in the mountains, where, as a  friend expressed it, \"all does not boil that bubbles.\" Unless you have  all day and unlimited firewood they will not cook in a high altitude.  Lima beans are easier cooked. A few chilis are nice to add to the pot by  way of variety.    _Pilot Bread or Hardtack._--If you use it at all--which of course must  be in small quantities for emergencies--be sure to get the coarsest. It  comes in several grades, and the finer crumble. The coarse, however,  breaks no finer than the size of a dollar, and so is edible no matter  how badly smashed. With raisins it makes a good lunch.    _Butter_, like milk, is a luxury I do without on a long trip. The lack  is never felt after a day or two. I believe you can get it in air-tight  cans.    _Macaroni_ is bulky, but a single package goes a long way, and is both  palatable and nutritious. Break it into pieces an inch or so long and  stow it in a grub bag.    [Sidenote: Canned Goods]    That finishes the list of the bulk groceries. Canned goods, in general,  are better left at home. You are carrying the weight not only of the  vegetable, but also of the juice and the tin. One can of tomatoes merely  helps out on one meal, and occupies enough space to accommodate eight  meals of rice; or enough weight to balance two dozen meals of the same  vegetable. Both the space of the kyacks and the carrying power of your  horse are better utilized in other directions. I assume you never will  be fool enough to weight your own back with such things.    So much for common sense and theory. As a matter of practice, and if you  have enough animals to avoid overloading, you will generally tuck in a  can here and there. These are to be used only on great occasions, but  grace mightily holidays and very tired times.    Now some canned goods make you feel you are really getting something  worth while; and others do not.    _Corn_ is probably the most satisfactory of all. It is good warmed up,  made into fritters, baked into a pudding, or mixed with lima beans as  succotash.    [Sidenote: Good and Bad Canned Goods]    _Peas_ on the other hand are no good. Too much water, and too little pea  is the main trouble, which combines discouragingly with the fact that a  mouthful of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32958"],[0,"Edge Hill: The Battle and Battlefield; With Notes on Banbury & Thereabout (#11)"],[1,"in the county of Oxford. Part of the materials of the  chancel, the mouldings, walls, and buttresses are Norman, though the  church is mainly of the 14th century, about which time it was re-built.  The west doorway is surmounted by figures of the apostles, with a canopied  representation of the Saviour at the apex; on the left and right are  sculptured representations also of the rising of the dead and the  punishment of the lost. The spire, which is 195 feet high, presents a  particularly graceful outline. The square tower is crowned by an octagon  middle stage, rising above which is a balcony, projected on corbels from  the face of the tower. Within the balcony the spire springs, and from the  four angles of the square tower stage slender turrets, terminating in  spirets, are carried up through the middle stage to above the springing of  the spire. The geometric tracery of the windows of the west front, and the  grotesque cornice carvings on the north side, are exceedingly good work.  The decorated oak chancel screen is again a noticeable feature, and its  restoration has brought to light the remains of paintings on its lower  panels. There are also remains of a mural painting of St. Christopher on  the north wall, and of others on the wall above the rood loft. There are  large perpendicular windows in the Milcombe chapelry, on the south side of  the church, and in its north aisle is a beautiful decorated column, having  an enriched capital, with sculptures of mailed figures and heads of  saints. A good Gothic font, the carved work of the hoods of the north and  south doorways, and a handsome modern reredos and other portions of the  chancel can here be mentioned only.    KING'S SUTTON.--Altitudes: 385-282; population, 1037; 5 miles south-east  of Banbury. It is built on the red rock and marls of the Middle Lias. The  old life is represented in the handsome manor house, by tradition also  connected with the wanderings of King Charles I., and a good house on the  south side of the green said to have been a prebendary manor. The town was  in the eighteenth century, with the adjoining village of Astrop, of resort  for the use of its mineral waters. The chalybeate spring (St. Rumbald's  well) is in Sir Wm. Brown's park at Astrop. The well basin and the carved  stone hood stand as in old time together with the Well House. The Well  House, by the work of the doorway and windows, would appear to be of  earlier date than the well hood, but the spring is at present conveyed  from its source to a replica of the well head by the road side. The  associated buildings have long since disappeared, but the pleasant walk up  the old road past the Well Close and the Long Spinney remain. Near the  railway station at King's Sutton is the other mineral spring charged with  sulphate of soda, yet in common use by the people of the homesteads near.  Celia Fiennes in her diary, \"Through England on a side saddle,\" writes of  her journey: \"Thence I went to Astrop where is a Steele water much  ffrequented by y{e} Gentry, it has some mixture of Allum so is not so  strong as Tunbridge. There is a ffine Gravell Walke that is between 2  high cutt hedges where is a Roome for the Musick and a Roome for y{e}  Company besides y{e} Private Walkes. The well runnes very quick, they are  not curious in keeping it, neither is there any bason for the spring to  run out off, only a dirty well full of moss's which is all changed yellow  by the water. There are Lodgings about for y{e} Company at a little place  called Sutton.\" Halliwell gives the following rhyme in his nursery series:      \"King's Sutton is a pretty town,      And lies all in a valley:    There is a pretty ring of bells,      Besides a bowling-alley:    Wine and liquor in good store,      Pretty maidens plenty:    Can a man desire more?      There aint such a town in twenty.\"      [Illustration: KING'S SUTTON CHURCH.]      KING'S SUTTON CHURCH is dedicated to St. Peter. The chancel is principally  Norman work, and has along each side a continuous stone bench under an  arcade, exhibiting the characteristic zigzag moulding. The piers and  arches on the south side of the nave are also Norman; those on the north  side are early English. The rood loft turret and staircase remain in the  south abutment of the chancel arch. The appearance of the tower from the  north and south-west is very beautiful. Crocketed pinnacles, connected by  flying buttresses with the face of the spire, are arranged around the  junction of the spire and tower, and the spire itself is boldly crocketed  from base to apex. It is of the early perpendicular period. The deeply  recessed doorway of the western entrance may be of somewhat later date,  and contains the original west door. Separating the chancel from the nave  is a beautiful oak screen, which was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott.    A well-known local rhyme, referring to the spires of the three famous  churches of the neighbourhood, says:--      Bloxham for length,    Adderbury for strength,      And King's Sutton for beauty.    A hill side coppice bearing the name of Rosamunds Bower and the Moate  House are within easy walking distance. The pathway near the bog (mineral)  spring is the shorter and pleasanter route to Banbury, leading near to the  calcining furnaces and ironstone quarries of the Astrop Ironstone Company.    COMPTON WYNYATES, the residence of The Marquis of Northampton, is distant  about nine miles to the south-west of Banbury, and is a beautiful example  of a brick castellated house of Tudor date. It stands in a prettily  wooded hollow at the foot of the hills which skirt the south-east border  of Warwickshire. The building surrounds a quadrangle, and was formerly  encircled by a moat, which has now been filled in on the west, south, and  east sides; its erection began about 1519. The woodwork of the gables and  the doorway of the entrance front, with the shields bearing the Tudor  roses and the emblems of Castile and Arragon, are good instances of the  work of the time. On the right of the quadrangle is the rich bay window of  the hall, and in the hall itself is a finely carved wood screen, coeval  with the building. The tower, and particularly the highly ornamented brick  chimneys, are worth detailed attention. Adjoining the tower is the chapel,  the window of which looks out upon the lawn; a secret passage and Roman  Catholic chapel also testify to the troubled transition times of the early  households. There is but space to note two incidents in the long history  of the house,--the visit of King Henry VIII., and in later years the  fierce little fight when the place, garrisoned by the Puritan troops, was  attacked by Sir Charles and Sir Wm. Compton with a party of Royalists from  Banbury. The Comptons failed to regain their home.      [Illustration: COMPTON WYNYATES, HALL WINDOW.]      HORLEY.--Altitudes, 500-400; population, 247; is 4 miles north-west of  Banbury, and may be reached by a pleasant footpath passing over Ruscot  Hill and through Drayton fields. The village stands at the neck dividing  two of the high vales of North Oxon, the Lias ironstone covering all the  high lands thereabouts. St. Ethelreda's Church, plain, square towered and  full of good old Early English work, is in mid village; the two pointed  arches between chancel and nave, the old glass of the north aisle and the  great mural painting of Saint Christopher, the Christ bearer, with the  legend:      \"What are thou; and art so yying    Bar I never so heavy a thinge.\"      \"Yey, I be hevy, no wunther nys    For I am the Kynge of blys.\"    All these, and the organ (1765), are worth the passing hour of the  wayfarer. Many of the houses, for instance that of Mr. B. Hirons, are of  good proportion and build. At the north-west end of the village, Clump  Lane leads to some beautifully terraced fields known as Steps Meadow and  Hadsham Hollow, and the footway along the high bank to the near village of  Hornton is also one of the pleasant ways of the countryside. At the Yellow  Well beyond the Horley House a dole of bread was wont to be made on St.  Thomas's day.    RADWAY.--Altitude, 400; population, 216; 9 miles north-west of Banbury; is  pleasantly reached by the pathway below the Tower at Ratley Grange. Radway  Grange by alteration about 1735 lost most of its good features as a  building--it stands on the slopes of its park land at the foot of the  hill. The farm pool runs close to the road side, and a pleasant prospect  of the hill side is got through its foliage. The church is more noticeable  for its enclosure of the Kingsmill monument, one of the burials of the  Edge Hill fight, than for its architectural style. The wide openings of  the village and the high wooded lanes of the Edge are diversified with  many a pleasant path and resting place.      [Illustration: COMPTON WYNYATES, ANGLE AND CHIMNEYS.]      WARMINGTON.--Altitudes: high town, 600; low town, 409; population, 269.  The village is within the Warwickshire border, 5-1/2 miles to the north of  Banbury, and is built on the slopes of a continuation of the Edge Hill  escarpment. From the south side it is hidden from view by the woods of  Deddington Hill. The church stands on a bold mass of Lias rock jutting  into the roadway, and with the old homesteads surrounding the green and  pool and the high banks clothed with wood and orchard, have given  Warmington a high reputation for beauty even amongst the many beautiful  villages near it. St. Nicholas' Church is known to antiquarians more by  the plain solidity of its work than by any richness of ornamentation. It  has heavy Norman and early English piers, and sedilia and piscina in the  chancel with Norman enrichment. The priest's house, one of the best of the  countryside, is on the north side. It has done service as vestry also, and  in the window embrasure in the upper room is a stone altar table. There is  the ancient stone fireplace also, and a window "]]]
