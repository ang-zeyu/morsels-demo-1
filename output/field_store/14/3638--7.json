'But don't you worry -- just plunge across,     For he swims like a well-trained setter.    Then hide away in the scrub and gorse    The rest will be far ahead of course --     The further ahead the better.      'You must rush the jumps in the last half-round     For fear that he might refuse 'em;    He'll try to baulk with you, I'll be bound,    Take whip and spurs on the mean old hound,     And don't be afraid to use 'em.      'At the final round, when the field are slow     And you are quite fresh to meet 'em,    Sit down, and hustle him all you know    With the whip and spurs, and he'll have to go --     Remember, you've GOT to beat 'em!'           .    .    .    .    .      The flag went down and we seemed to fly,     And we made the timbers shiver    Of the first big fence, as the stand flashed by,    And I caught the ring of the trainer's cry:     'Go on!  For the Mooki River!'      I jammed him in with a well-packed crush,     And recklessly -- out for slaughter --    Like a living wave over fence and brush    We swept and swung with a flying rush,     Till we came to the dreaded water.      Ha, ha! I laugh at it now to think     Of the way I contrived to work it.    Shut in amongst them, before you'd wink,    He found himself on the water's brink,     With never a chance to shirk it!      The thought of the horror he felt, beguiles     The heart of this grizzled rover!    He gave a snort you could hear for miles,    And a spring would have cleared the Channel Isles     And carried me safely over!      Then we neared the scrub, and I pulled him back     In the shade where the gum-leaves quiver:    And I waited there in the shadows black    While the rest of the horses, round the track,     Went on like a rushing river!      At the second round, as the field swept by,     I saw that the pace was telling;    But on they thundered, and by-and-bye    As they passed the stand I could hear the cry     Of the folk in the distance, yelling!      Then the last time round!  And the hoofbeats rang!     And I said, 'Well, it's now or never!'    And out on the heels of the throng I sprang,    And the spurs bit deep and the whipcord sang     As I rode!  For the Mooki River!      We raced for home in a cloud of dust     And the curses rose in chorus.    'Twas flog, and hustle, and jump you must!    And The Cow ran well -- but to my disgust     There was one got home before us.      'Twas a big black horse, that I had not seen     In the part of the race I'd ridden;    And his coat was cool and his rider clean,    And I thought that perhaps I had not been     The only one that had hidden.           .    .    .    .    .      And the trainer came with a visage blue     With rage, when the race concluded:    Said he, 'I thought you'd have pulled us through,    But the man on the black horse planted too,     AND NEARER TO HOME THAN YOU DID!'      Alas to think that those times so gay     Have vanished and passed for ever!    You don't believe in the yarn you say?    Why, man!  'Twas a matter of every day     When we raced on the Mooki River!          In the Stable          What!  You don't like him; well, maybe -- we all have our fancies, of course:    Brumby to look at you reckon?  Well, no:  he's a thoroughbred horse;    Sired by a son of old Panic -- look at his ears and his head --    Lop-eared and Roman-nosed, ain't he? -- well, that's how the Panics are bred.    Gluttonous, ugly and lazy, rough as a tip-cart to ride,    Yet if you offered a sovereign apiece for the hairs on his hide    That wouldn't buy him, nor twice that; while I've a pound to the good,    This here old stager stays by me and lives like a thoroughbred should:    Hunt him away from his bedding, and sit yourself down by the wall,    Till you hear how the old fellow saved me from Gilbert, O'Maley and Hall.           .    .    .    .    .      Gilbert and Hall and O'Maley, back in the bushranging days,    Made themselves kings of the district -- ruled it in old-fashioned ways --    Robbing the coach and the escort, stealing our horses at night,    Calling sometimes at the homesteads and giving the women a fright:    Came to the station one morning -- and why they did this no one knows --    Took a brood mare from the paddock -- wanting some fun, I suppose --    Fastened a bucket beneath her, hung by a strap round her flank,    Then turned her loose in the timber back of the seven-mile tank.      Go!  She went mad!  She went tearing      and screaming with fear through the trees,    While the curst bucket beneath her was banging her flanks and her knees.    Bucking and racing and screaming she ran to the back of the run,    Killed herself there in a gully; by God, but they paid for their fun!    Paid for it dear, for the black-boys found tracks, and the bucket, and all,    And I swore that I'd live to get even with Gilbert, O'Maley and Hall.      Day after day then I chased them -- 'course they had friends on the sly,    Friends who were willing to sell them to those who were willing to buy.    Early one morning we found them in camp at the Cockatoo Farm    One of us shot at O'Maley and wounded him under the arm:    Ran them for miles in the ranges, till Hall, with his horse fairly beat,    Took to the rocks and we lost him -- the others made good their retreat.    It was war to the knife then, I tell you, and once, on the door of my shed,    They nailed up a notice that offered a hundred reward for my head!      Then we heard they were gone from the district;      they stuck up a coach in the West,    And I rode by myself in the paddocks, taking a bit of a rest,    Riding this colt as a youngster -- awkward, half-broken and shy,    He wheeled round one day on a sudden; I looked, but I couldn't see why,    But I soon found out why, for before me, the hillside rose up like a wall,    And there on the top with their rifles were Gilbert, O'Maley and Hall!      'Twas a good three-mile run to the homestead --      bad going, with plenty of trees --    So I gathered the youngster together, and gripped at his ribs with my knees.    'Twas a mighty poor chance to escape them!  It puts a man's nerve to the test    On a half-broken colt to be hunted by the best mounted men in the West.    But the half-broken colt was a racehorse!  He lay down to work with a will,    Flashed through the scrub like a clean-skin --      by Heavens we FLEW down the hill!    Over a twenty-foot gully he swept with the spring of a deer    And they fired as we jumped, but they missed me --      a bullet sang close to my ear --    And the jump gained us ground, for they shirked it:      but I saw as we raced through the gap    That the rails at the homestead were fastened --      I was caught like a rat in a trap.    Fenced with barbed wire was the paddock --      barbed wire that would cut like a knife --    How was a youngster to clear it that never had jumped in his life?      Bang went a rifle behind me -- the colt gave a spring, he was hit;    Straight at the sliprails I rode him -- I felt him take hold of the bit;    Never a foot to the right or the left did he swerve in his stride,    Awkward and frightened, but honest, the sort it's a pleasure to ride!    Straight at the rails, where they'd fastened      barbed wire on the top of the post,    Rose like a stag and went over, with hardly a scratch at the most;    Into the homestead I darted, and snatched down my gun from the wall,    And I tell you I made them step lively, Gilbert, O'Maley and Hall!      Yes!  There's the mark of the bullet -- he's got it inside of him yet    Mixed up somehow with his victuals, but bless you he don't seem to fret!    Gluttonous, ugly, and lazy -- eats any thing he can bite;    Now, let us shut up the stable, and bid the old fellow good-night:    Ah!  We can't breed 'em, the sort that were bred when we old 'uns were young.    Yes, I was saying, these bushrangers, none of 'em lived to be hung,    Gilbert was shot by the troopers, Hall was betrayed by his friend,    Campbell disposed of O'Maley, bringing the lot to an end.    But you can talk about riding -- I've ridden a lot in the past --    Wait till there's rifles behind you, you'll know what it means to go fast!    I've steeplechased, raced, and 'run horses',      but I think the most dashing of all    Was the ride when the old fellow saved me from Gilbert, O'Maley and Hall!          \"He Giveth His Beloved Sleep\"          The long day passes with its load of sorrow:     In slumber deep    I lay me down to rest until to-morrow --     Thank God for sleep.      Thank God for all respite from weary toiling,     From cares that creep    Across our lives like evil shadows, spoiling     God's kindly sleep.      We plough and sow, and, as the hours grow later,     We strive to reap,    And build our barns, and hope to build them greater     Before we sleep.      We toil and strain and strive with one another     In hopes to heap    Some greater share of profit than our brother     Before we sleep.      What will it profit that with tears or laughter     Our watch we keep?    Beyond it all there lies the Great Hereafter!     Thank God for sleep!      For, at the last, beseeching Christ to save us,     We turn with deep    Heart-felt thanksgiving unto God, who gave us     The Gift of Sleep.          Driver Smith          'Twas Driver Smith of Battery A was anxious to see a fight;    He thought of the Transvaal all the day, he thought of it all the night --    'Well, if the battery's left behind, I'll go to the war,' says he,    'I'll go a-driving an ambulance in the ranks of the A.M.C.      'I'm fairly sick of these here parades, it's want of a change that kills    A-charging the Randwick Rifle Range and aiming at Surry Hills.    And I think if I go with the ambulance I'm certain to find a show,    For they have to send the Medical men wherever the troops can go.

I try to work it out but lacking all other information  the best I can do is inject two and keep one till later. I put that  one in my pocket.    The stretcher is all expanded now; a very thin but quite rigid grid,  six feet by two; I lash him on it without changing his position and  fasten the helmet over his head.    Antigrav; the straps just go round him and the stretcher.    I point the thing up towards the trap door and give it a gentle push;  then I scramble up the rungs and get there just in time to guide it  through. It takes a knock then and some more while I am getting it  down to the next partition, but he can't feel it.    This time I find the door, because the roar of noise behind it acts as  a guide. The sea is getting up and is dashing halfway to the door as I  crawl through. My boat is awash, pivoting to and fro on the grips of  the front \"limbs.\"    I grab it, release the limbs and pull it as far back as the door. I  maneuver the stretcher on top and realize there is nothing to fasten  it with ... except the antigrav, I get that undone, holding the  stretcher in balance, and manage to put it under the stretcher and  pass the straps between the bars of the grid ... then round the little  boat, and the buckle just grips the last inch. It will hold, though.           *       *       *       *       *    I set the boat to face the broken end of the ship, but I daren't put  it farther back than the doorway; I turn the antigrav to half, fasten  the limb-grips and rush back towards the nose of the ship. Silver knob  under the dial. I turn it down, hear the thing begin a fast, steady  ticking, and turn and run.    Twenty minutes.    One and a half to get back to the boat, four to get inside it without  overturning. Nearly two to get down to the sea--balance difficult. One  and a half to lower myself in.    Thirty seconds' tossing before I sink below the wave layer; then I  turn the motor as high as I dare and head for the shore.    In a minute I have to turn it down; at this speed the radar is  bothered by water currents and keeps steering me away from them as  though they were rocks; I finally find the maximum safe speed but it  is achingly slow. What happens if you are in water when Andite blows  half a mile away? A moment's panic as I find the ship being forced up,  then I realize I have reached the point where the beach starts to  shelve, turn off radar and motor and start crawling. Eternal slow  reach out, grab, shove, haul, with my heart in my mouth; then suddenly  the nose breaks water and I am hauling myself out with a last wave  doing its best to overbalance me.    I am halfway out of the boat when the Andite blows behind me. There is  a flat slapping sound; then an instant roar of wind as the air  receives the binding energies of several tons of matter; then a long  wave comes pelting up the beach and snatches at the boat.    I huddle into the shingle and hold the boat; I have just got the  antigrav turned off, otherwise I think it would have been carried  away. There are two or three more big waves and a patter of spray;  then it is over.    The outlet valve of the helmet is working, so M'Clare is still  breathing; very deep, very slow.    I unfasten the belt of the antigrav, having turned it on again, and  pull the belt through the buckle. No time to take it off and rearrange  it; anyway it will work as well under the stretcher as on top of it. I  drag the boat down to the water, put in an Andite cartridge with the  longest fuse I have, set the controls to take it straight out to sea  at maximum depth the radar control will allow--six feet above  bottom--and push it off. The other Andite cartridge starts burning a  hole in my pocket; I would have liked to put that in too, but I must  keep it, in case.    I look at my chrono and see that in five minutes the hopper will come.    Five minutes.    I am halfway back to the stretcher when I hear a noise further up the  beach. Unmistakable. Shingle under a booted foot.    I stand frozen in mid-stride. I turned the light out after launching  the boat but my eyes have not recovered yet; it is murkily black. Even  my white suit is only the faintest degree paler than my surroundings.    Silence for a couple of minutes. I stand still. But it can't have gone  away. What happens when the hopper comes? They will see whoever it is  on the infrared vision screen. They won't come--    Footsteps again. Several.    Then the clouds part and one of those superfluous little moons shines  straight through the gap.    The bay is not like the stereo the colonel showed because that was  taken in winter; now the snow is melted, leaving bare shingle and mud  and a tumble of rocks; more desolate than the snow. Fifty feet off is  a man.    He is huddled up in a mass of garments but his head is bare, rising  out of a hood which he has pushed back, maybe so as to listen better;  he looks young, hardly older than me. He is holding a long thin object  which I never saw before, but it must be a weapon of some sort.    This is the end of it. All the evidence of faking is destroyed; except  M'Clare and me. Even if I use the Andite he has seen me--and that  leaves M'Clare.    [Illustration]    I am standing here on one foot like a dancer in a jammed movie,  waiting for Time to start again or the world to end--    Like the little figure in the dance-instruction kit Dad got when I was  seven, when you switched her off in the middle.           *       *       *       *       *    Like a dancer--    My weight shifts on to the forward foot. My arms swing up, forwards,  back. I take one step, another.    Swing. Turn. Kick. Sideways.    Like the silly little dancer who could not get out of the plastic  block; but I am moving forward little by little, even if I have to  take three steps roundabout for every one in advance.    Arms, up. Turn, round. Leg, up. Straighten, out. Step.    Called the Dance of the Little Robot, for about three months Dad  thought it was no end cute, till he caught on I was thinking so, too.    It is just about the only kind of dance you could do on shingle, I  guess.    When this started I thought I might be going crazy, but I just had not  had time to work it out. In terms of Psychology it goes like this; to  shoot off a weapon a man needs a certain type of Stimulus like the  sight of an enemy over the end of it. So if I do my best not to look  like an enemy he will not get that Stimulus. Or put it another way  most men think twice before shooting a girl in the middle of a dance.  If I should happen to get away with this, nobody will believe his  story, he won't believe it himself.    As for the chance of getting away with it, i.e., getting close enough  to grab the gun or hit him with a rock or something, I know I would  become a Stimulus to shooting before I did that but there are always  the clouds, if one will only come back over the moon again.    I have covered half the distance.    Twenty feet from him, and he takes a quick step back.    Turn, kick, out, step. I am swinging round away from him, let's hope  he finds it reassuring. I dare not look up but I think the light is  dimming. Turn, kick, out, step. Boxing the compass. Coming round  again.    And the cloud is coming over the moon, out of the corner of my eye I  see darkness sweeping towards us--and I see his face of sheer horror  as he sees it, too; he jumps back, swings up the weapon, and fires  straight in my face.    And it is dark. So much for Psychology.    There is a clatter and other sounds--    Well, quite a lot for Psychology maybe, because at twenty feet he  seems to have missed me.           *       *       *       *       *    I pick myself up and touch something which apparently is his weapon,  gun or whatever. I leave it and hare back to the stretcher, next-to  fall over it but stop just in time, and switch on the antigrav. Up;  level it; now where to? The cliffs enclosing the bay are about thirty  yards off to my left and they offer the only cover.    The shingle is relatively level; I make good time till I stumble  against a rock and nearly lose the stretcher. I step up on to the rock  and see the cliff as a blacker mass in the general darkness, only a  yard away. I edge the stretcher round it.    It is almost snatched out of my hand by a gust of wind. I pull it back  and realize that in the bay I have been sheltered; there is pretty  near half a gale blowing across the face of the cliff.    Voices and footsteps, away back among the rocks where the man came  from.    If the clouds part again they will see me, sure as shooting.    I take a hard grip on the stretcher and scramble round the edge of the  cliff.    After the first gust the wind is not so bad; for the most part it is  trying to press me back into the cliff. The trouble is that I can't  see. I have to shuffle my foot forward, rubbing one shoulder against  the cliff to feel where it is because I have no hand free.    After a few yards I come to an impasse; something more than knee high;  boulder, ridge, I can't tell.    I weigh on the edge of the stretcher and tilt it up to get it over the  obstacle. With the antigrav full on it keeps its momentum and goes on  moving up. I try to check it, but the wind gets underneath.    It is tugging to get away; I step blindly upwards in the effort to  keep up with it. One foot goes on a narrow ledge, barely a toe hold. I  am being hauled upwards. I bring the other foot up and find the top of  a boulder, just within reach. Now the first foot--    And now I am on top of the boulder, but I have lost touch with the  cliff and the full force of the wind is pulling the stretcher upwards.  I get one arm over it and fumble underneath for the control of the  antigrav; I must give it weight and put it down on this boulder and  wait for the wind to drop.    Suddenly I realize that my weight is going;"]]]
