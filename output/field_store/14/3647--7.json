Neither could any other law  possibly exist; for a law always supposes some superior who is to make  it; and in a state of nature we are all equal, without any other  superior but him who is the author of our being. But man was formed  for society; and, as is demonstrated by the writers on this  subject[b], is neither capable of living alone, nor indeed has the  courage to do it. However, as it is impossible for the whole race of  mankind to be united in one great society, they must necessarily  divide into many; and form separate states, commonwealths, and  nations; entirely independent of each other, and yet liable to a  mutual intercourse. Hence arises a third kind of law to regulate this  mutual intercourse, called \"the law of nations;\" which, as none of  these states will acknowlege a superiority in the other, cannot be  dictated by either; but depends entirely upon the rules of natural  law, or upon mutual compacts, treaties, leagues, and agreements  between these several communities: in the construction also of which  compacts we have no other rule to resort to, but the law of nature;  being the only one to which both communities are equally subject: and  therefore the civil law[c] very justly observes, that _quod naturalis  ratio inter omnes homines constituit, vocatur jus gentium_.    [Footnote b: Puffendorf, _l._ 7. _c._ 1. compared with Barbeyrac's  commentary.]    [Footnote c: _Ff._ 1. 1. 9.]    THUS much I thought it necessary to premise concerning the law of  nature, the revealed law, and the law of nations, before I proceeded  to treat more fully of the principal subject of this section,  municipal or civil law; that is, the rule by which particular  districts, communities, or nations are governed; being thus defined by  Justinian[d], \"_jus civile est quod quisque sibi populus constituit_.\"  I call it _municipal_ law, in compliance with common speech; for, tho'  strictly that expression denotes the particular customs of one single  _municipium_ or free town, yet it may with sufficient propriety be  applied to any one state or nation, which is governed by the same laws  and customs.    [Footnote d: _Inst._ 1. 2. 1.]    MUNICIPAL law, thus understood, is properly defined to be \"a rule of  civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding  what is right and prohibiting what is wrong.\" Let us endeavour to  explain it's several properties, as they arise out of this definition.    AND, first, it is a _rule_; not a transient sudden order from a  superior to or concerning a particular person; but something  permanent, uniform, and universal. Therefore a particular act of the  legislature to confiscate the goods of Titius, or to attaint him of  high treason, does not enter into the idea of a municipal law: for the  operation of this act is spent upon Titius only, and has no relation  to the community in general; it is rather a sentence than a law. But  an act to declare that the crime of which Titius is accused shall be  deemed high treason; this has permanency, uniformity, and  universality, and therefore is properly a _rule_. It is also called a  _rule_, to distinguish it from _advice_ or _counsel_, which we are at  liberty to follow or not, as we see proper; and to judge upon the  reasonableness or unreasonableness of the thing advised. Whereas our  obedience to the _law_ depends not upon _our approbation_, but upon  the _maker's will_. Counsel is only matter of persuasion, law is  matter of injunction; counsel acts only upon the willing, law upon the  unwilling also.    IT is also called a _rule_, to distinguish it from a _compact_ or  _agreement_; for a compact is a promise proceeding _from_ us, law is a  command directed _to_ us. The language of a compact is, \"I will, or  will not, do this;\" that of a law is, \"thou shalt, or shalt not, do  it.\" It is true there is an obligation which a compact carries with  it, equal in point of conscience to that of a law; but then the  original of the obligation is different. In compacts, we ourselves  determine and promise what shall be done, before we are obliged to do  it; in laws, we are obliged to act, without ourselves determining or  promising any thing at all. Upon these accounts law is defined to be  \"_a rule_.\"    MUNICIPAL law is also \"a rule _of civil conduct_.\" This distinguishes  municipal law from the natural, or revealed; the former of which is  the rule of _moral_ conduct, and the latter not only the rule of moral  conduct, but also the rule of faith. These regard man as a creature,  and point out his duty to God, to himself, and to his neighbour,  considered in the light of an individual. But municipal or civil law  regards him also as a citizen, and bound to other duties towards his  neighbour, than those of mere nature and religion: duties, which he  has engaged in by enjoying the benefits of the common union; and which  amount to no more, than that he do contribute, on his part, to the  subsistence and peace of the society.    IT is likewise \"a rule _prescribed_.\" Because a bare resolution,  confined in the breast of the legislator, without manifesting itself  by some external sign, can never be properly a law. It is requisite  that this resolution be notified to the people who are to obey it. But  the manner in which this notification is to be made, is matter of very  great indifference. It may be notified by universal tradition and long  practice, which supposes a previous publication, and is the case of  the common law of England. It may be notified, _viva voce_, by  officers appointed for that purpose, as is done with regard to  proclamations, and such acts of parliament as are appointed to be  publicly read in churches and other assemblies. It may lastly be  notified by writing, printing, or the like; which is the general  course taken with all our acts of parliament. Yet, whatever way is  made use of, it is incumbent on the promulgators to do it in the most  public and perspicuous manner; not like Caligula, who (according to  Dio Cassius) wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung them  up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare the people.  There is still a more unreasonable method than this, which is called  making of laws _ex post facto_; when _after_ an action is committed,  the legislator then for the first time declares it to have been a  crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it;  here it is impossible that the party could foresee that an action,  innocent when it was done, should be afterwards converted to guilt by  a subsequent law; he had therefore no cause to abstain from it; and  all punishment for not abstaining must of consequence be cruel and  unjust[e]. All laws should be therefore made to commence _in futuro_,  and be notified before their commencement; which is implied in the  term \"_prescribed_.\" But when this rule is in the usual manner  notified, or prescribed, it is then the subject's business to be  thoroughly acquainted therewith; for if ignorance, of what he _might_  know, were admitted as a legitimate excuse, the laws would be of no  effect, but might always be eluded with impunity.    [Footnote e: Such laws among the Romans were denominated _privilegia_,  or private laws, of which Cicero _de leg._ 3. 19. and in his oration  _pro domo_, 17. thus speaks; \"_Vetant leges sacratae, vetant duodecim  tabulae, leges privatis hominibus irrogari; id enim est privilegium.  Nemo unquam tulit, nihil est crudelius, nihil perniciosius, nihil quod  minus haec civitas ferre possit_.\"]    BUT farther: municipal law is \"a rule of civil conduct prescribed _by  the supreme power in a state_.\" For legislature, as was before  observed, is the greatest act of superiority that can be exercised by  one being over another. Wherefore it is requisite to the very essence  of a law, that it be made by the supreme power. Sovereignty and  legislature are indeed convertible terms; one cannot subsist without  the other.    THIS will naturally lead us into a short enquiry concerning the nature  of society and civil government; and the natural, inherent right that  belongs to the sovereignty of a state, wherever that sovereignty be  lodged, of making and enforcing laws.    THE only true and natural foundations of society are the wants and the  fears of individuals. Not that we can believe, with some theoretical  writers, that there ever was a time when there was no such thing as  society; and that, from the impulse of reason, and through a sense of  their wants and weaknesses, individuals met together in a large plain,  entered into an original contract, and chose the tallest man present  to be their governor. This notion, of an actually existing unconnected  state of nature, is too wild to be seriously admitted; and besides it  is plainly contradictory to the revealed accounts of the primitive  origin of mankind, and their preservation two thousand years  afterwards; both which were effected by the means of single families.  These formed the first society, among themselves; which every day  extended it's limits, and when it grew too large to subsist with  convenience in that pastoral state, wherein the patriarchs appear to  have lived, it necessarily subdivided itself by various migrations  into more. Afterwards, as agriculture increased, which employs and can  maintain a much greater number of hands, migrations became less  frequent; and various tribes, which had formerly separated, re-united  again; sometimes by compulsion and conquest, sometimes by accident,  and sometimes perhaps by compact. But though society had not it's  formal beginning from any convention of individuals, actuated by their  wants and their fears; yet it is the _sense_ of their weakness and  imperfection that _keeps_ mankind together; that demonstrates the  necessity of this union; and that therefore is the solid and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#11)"],[1," few weavers who do not own pandans themselves must  purchase. The leaves are sold on the tree, the purchaser cutting them  off with a bolo. The price is from 20 to 30 centavos per hundred,  depending upon their size, softness, thickness, and imperfections. The  longest, thinnest, darkest green leaves, with the fewest imperfections,  are considered the best and cost the most. In Cavinti, where the leaves  are imported from Luisiana and Majayjay, the price of the best leaves  is 50 centavos per hundred. The estimates of the number of leaves  yielded by a plant in a year differ considerably. By some it is stated  that on the average one leaf is produced per month; others report  that from three to five leaves are gathered in from three to six weeks.    The thorns are removed from the edges, and the midrib is cut away,  thus reducing the leaf into two halves, each of which is again  divided. These strips are placed in the sun for half a day. The  unique process in the preparation of this pandan straw is the rolling  which occurs at this point. While it is probable that any roller with  sufficient weight could be used, that employed in the pandan districts  of Laguna is the primitive \"iluhan\" by which sugar-cane and copra are  also crushed. It consists essentially of three heavy wooden horses, in  the grooves of which a log, heavily weighted with stones, rotates. The  pandan lengths are placed in one of the grooves underneath the log and  so rolled. The object of the process is to make the material thinner  and more pliable. Straw is stripped from the lengths thus prepared  by the use of the gauge. [20] The straw is then further dried in the  sunshine and is ready to be woven. Sometimes the lengths are stripped  before being rolled, hence the straw is left in the sunshine for  another half day and then placed under the log in the iluhan.    Mats are woven in Majayjay and Luisiana only, the weavers of  Cavinti devoting their entire time to the fabrication of hats. The  mats are woven of single straw, but they are fairly thick and not  at all limber. The number produced per week runs probably into the  thousands, of which about 75 per cent are made of coarse straw and are  intended for use in drying palay, copra, etc. These mats are known as  \"bangkoan,\" a word having about the same significance as \"bastos;\"  that is, coarsely or poorly made. The finer and better made mats are  intended for use as sleeping mats and for the floor. They are decorated  with colored buri straw, usually in some shade of red produced by  mordanting with kolis leaves and boiling with sappan wood as explained  for buri straw. Occasionally, other colors are used, produced from  the imported coal-tar (\"Chino\") dyes, but in all cases the shades  produced are not very pleasing. The decorations are embroidered in,  and consist of simple borders in straight lines with an open center  design of somewhat the same pattern. When first woven, the mats are  usually of a dark green color. Before being sold, they are placed in  the sun, which changes them to a grayish color somewhat resembling  sabutan. After long use, however, the final shade is yellowish green.    There seems to be but little division of labor in the production of  these mats. Usually the whole family goes out into the patch and cuts  the leaves, removing the thorns before bringing them home. Only women  weave the mats. In Majayjay a few workers color their own buri straw  used in decorating the mats, but for the most part this material is  obtained from dyers, one a Chinese, the other a Filipino, who prepare  it for sale.    The weavers are independent of advances by brokers and sell their  product to Filipinos or to the representatives of Chinese merchants  in Pagsanjan and Manila. A few weavers take their mats to Lukban,  whence they are distributed over Tayabas Province, but many more are  gathered up by these brokers and sold in the market at Pagsanjan. The  mat market there usually occupies one whole sidewalk running the  length of the market building.    The pandan mats of Majayjay and Luisiana are notable for their strength  and durability, and are excellent for the floor or bath. In price they  range from P0.50 to P5.00. The usual price of the decorated mats is  P1.50. The demand continues brisk and prices have recently risen. The  weakest point in the mat at the present time is in the colored buri  straw used to decorate it, for this tears long before the pandan shows  signs of wear. If colored sabutan straw is substituted for the buri,  a much stronger and probably more pleasing article will result. [21]        Karagumoy. [22]    The pandan P. simplex, known as \"karagumoy\" or \"carogumoy,\" is the  economic pandan of the Bicol peninsula in southern Luzon. It is usually  found growing in well drained soil under the shade of banana and abaca  plants and areca palms. It needs this protection because the leaves are  easily broken or ruined by hard winds. The leaves are generally longer  than those of sabutan (they are 2 meters to 3 1/2 meters in length)  and are but from 6 cm. to 10 cm. wide. They are very thick, being  practically as coarse as the leaves of P. utilissimus. They bear stout  spines on the midrib and along the margins, from two centimeters to  three centimeters apart. A fungus disease often attacks them, causing  dry hard patches, and not only spoiling the color but also making  the material so brittle that it breaks in the preparation of the straw.    The plant is propagated by means of suckers in patches seldom over a  half hectare in extent and often consisting of a few plants back of  the house. The suckers are set out in rows and are probably one year  old when the first leaves are taken, though the workers disagree on  this point. At a specified time, from eight to fifteen leaves are  cut from the plant each year; at other periods, two or three may be  taken from the same plants. Most of the leaves are harvested during  the rainy season. Karagumoy leaves have a commercial value in many  of the places in which the plant occurs. In Tabaco, Albay, women cut  the leaves and carry them in large bundles to the market, where they  are sold at prices usually varying from 8 to 12 centavos per hundred.    Throughout the Province of Albay mats are made from karagumoy, and in  some towns the industry is of considerable importance. For instance,  in the barrio of San Lorenzo in Tabaco, mats may be found in the making  in nearly every house. In Sorsogon, too, the industry is widespread  though not so important commercially. In Balusa the production is  large enough to supply the local demand and leave a surplus for export  to neighboring towns. In the Bicol provinces karagumoy is considered  the best of all straws for the production of mats. In price the mats  vary from thirty to ninety centavos, according to fineness.    In preparing the material, the spines and midrib are first removed  and the leaves are divided into four strips of about equal width. The  straw is prepared from these with the knife and gauge; it is dried  in the shade for a few hours and drawn several times over a piece of  bamboo as explained for sabutan in order to make it more supple and  smooth. The mats are woven in the early morning and at night, the straw  being more pliable then. Attempts have been made in the schools to  dye karagumoy but no success has yet been attained. The mats are plain.        Bariu.    The stem of this plant, P. copelandii, grows from 4 to 9 meters  high. The leaves have an average length of 2.1 meter and a width of  8 cm. [23] Spines occur along the entire margin. Near the base they  are comparatively coarse and from 3 to 4 mm. long. Towards the apex  of the margins and midveins, the spines are short and close together  like the teeth of a fine saw. From 3 to 5 heads generally form on the  fruit stalk, each of them from 7 to 12 cm. long and 5 to 7 cm. across,  at first pale yellowish in appearance but soon turning red. Their  drupes are 14 mm. long and 3 to 4 mm. in diameter. This pandan is  found in Cagayan, Benguet, Nueva Ecija, Samar, Bohol, Occidental  Negros, Capiz, Surigao, Davao, and other provinces. [24]    This pandan is not of economic importance in central and southern  Luzon. In the Bicol provinces it is used to some extent but it is  considered inferior to other materials. In parts of the Visayas,  such as Bohol, Capiz and Samar, it is utilized to a considerable  extent, but cannot be considered of commercial importance. It is the  economic pandan of Surigao, but even there its commercial importance  is local only.      Table showing comparative measurements of certain Philippine pandans.

The species P. radicans is reported as olango from Leyte, wango in  Bohol, owango in Surigao and uyagno in Sorsogon. It is usually found  growing along rivers and in marshes. The trunk reaches a height of  8 m. and its largest leaves may be 6 m. long and 12 cm. wide. There  are from 6 to 10 dark brick red fruits in a cluster.
