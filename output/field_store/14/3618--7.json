Across the Atlantic came the news of Stephenson's remarkable success.  And by this time railroads were beginning in various parts of the United  States: the Mohawk and Hudson, from Albany to Schenectady; the Baltimore  and Ohio; the Charleston and Hamburg in South Carolina; the Camden and  Amboy, across New Jersey. Horses, mules, and even sails, furnished the  power for these early railroads. It can be imagined with what interest  the owners of these roads heard that at last a practicable locomotive  was running in England.    This news stimulated the directors of the Baltimore and Ohio to try the  locomotive. They had not far to go for an experiment, for Peter Cooper,  proprietor of the Canton Iron Works in Baltimore, had already designed  a small locomotive, the Tom Thumb. This was placed on trial in August,  1830, and is supposed to have been the first American-built locomotive  to do work on rails, though nearly coincident with it was the Best  Friend of Charleston, built by the West Point Foundry, New York, for the  Charleston and Hamburg Railroad. It is often difficult, as we have seen,  to say which of two or several things was first. It appears as though  the little Tom Thumb was the first engine built in America, which  actually pulled weight on a regular railway, while the much larger Best  Friend was the first to haul cars in regular daily service.    The West Point Foundry followed its first success with the West Point,  which also went into service on the Charleston and Hamburg Railroad, and  then built for the newly finished Mohawk and Hudson (the first link in  the New York Central Lines) the historic De Witt Clinton. This primitive  locomotive and the cars it drew may be seen today in the Grand Central  Station in New York.    Meanwhile, the Stevens brothers, sons of John Stevens, were engaged in  the construction of the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The first locomotive  to operate on this road was built in England by George Stephenson. This  was the John Bull, which arrived in the summer of 1831 and at once went  to work. The John Bull was a complete success and had a distinguished  career. Sixty-two years old, in 1893, it went to Chicago, to the  Columbian Exposition, under its own steam. The John Bull occupies a  place today in the National Museum at Washington.    With the locomotive definitely accepted, men began to turn their minds  towards its improvement and development, and locomotive building soon  became a leading industry in America. At first the British types and  patterns were followed, but it was not long before American designers  began to depart from the British models and to evolve a distinctively  American type. In the development of this type great names have been  written into the industrial history of America, among which the name of  Matthias Baldwin of Philadelphia probably ranks first. But there have  been hundreds of great workers in this field. From Stephenson's Rocket  and the little Tom Thumb of Peter Cooper, to the powerful \"Mallets\"  of today, is a long distance--not spanned in ninety years save by the  genius and restless toil of countless brains and hands.      If the locomotive could not remain as it was left by Stephenson and  Cooper, neither could the stationary steam engine remain as it was left  by James Watt and Oliver Evans. Demands increasing and again increasing,  year after year, forced the steam engine to grow in order to meet its  responsibilities. There were men living in Philadelphia in 1876, who had  known Oliver Evans personally; at least one old man at the Centennial  Exhibition had himself seen the Oruktor Amphibolos and recalled the  consternation it had caused on the streets of the city in 1804. It  seemed a far cry back to the Oruktor from the great and beautiful  engine, designed by George Henry Corliss, which was then moving all the  vast machinery of the Centennial Exhibition. But since then achievements  in steam have dwarfed even the great work of Corliss. And to do a kind  of herculean task that was hardly dreamed of in 1876 another type of  engine has made its entrance: the steam turbine, which sends its awful  energy, transformed into electric current, to light a million lamps or  to turn ten thousand wheels on distant streets and highways.        CHAPTER IV. SPINDLE, LOOM, AND NEEDLE IN NEW ENGLAND    The major steps in the manufacture of clothes are four: first to  harvest and clean the fiber or wool; second, to card it and spin it into  threads; third, to weave the threads into cloth; and, finally to fashion  and sew the cloth into clothes. We have already seen the influence  of Eli Whitney's cotton gin on the first process, and the series of  inventions for spinning and weaving, which so profoundly changed the  textile industry in Great Britain, has been mentioned. It will be the  business of this chapter to tell how spinning and weaving machinery was  introduced into the United States and how a Yankee inventor laid the  keystone of the arch of clothing machinery by his invention of the  sewing machine.    Great Britain was determined to keep to herself the industrial secrets  she had gained. According to the economic beliefs of the eighteenth  century, which gave place but slowly to the doctrines of Adam Smith,  monopoly rather than cheap production was the road to success. The  laws therefore forbade the export of English machinery or drawings  and specifications by which machines might be constructed in other  countries. Some men saw a vast prosperity for Great Britain, if only the  mystery might be preserved.    Meanwhile the stories of what these machines could do excited envy in  other countries, where men desired to share in the industrial gains.  And, even before Eli Whitney's cotton gin came to provide an abundant  supply of raw material, some Americans were struggling to improve the  old hand loom, found in every house, and to make some sort of a spinning  machine to replace the spinning wheel by which one thread at a time was  laboriously spun.    East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, was the scene of one of the earliest  of these experiments. There in 1786 two Scotchmen, who claimed to  understand Arkwright's mechanism, were employed to make spinning  machines, and about the same time another attempt was made at Beverly.  In both instances the experiments were encouraged by the State and  assisted with grants of money. The machines, operated by horse power,  were crude, and the product was irregular and unsatisfactory. Then  three men at Providence, Rhode Island, using drawings of the Beverly  machinery, made machines having thirty-two spindles which worked  indifferently. The attempt to run them by water power failed, and they  were sold to Moses Brown of Pawtucket, who with his partner, William  Almy, had mustered an army of hand-loom weavers in 1790, large enough to  produce nearly eight thousand yards of cloth in that year. Brown's need  of spinning machinery, to provide his weavers with yarn, was very great;  but these machines he had bought would not run, and in 1790 there was  not a single successful power-spinner in the United States.    Meanwhile Benjamin Franklin had come home, and the Pennsylvania Society  for the Encouragement of Manufactures and Useful Arts was offering  prizes for inventions to improve the textile industry. And in Milford,  England, was a young man named Samuel Slater, who, on hearing that  inventive genius was munificently rewarded in America, decided to  migrate to that country. Slater at the age of fourteen had been  apprenticed to Jedediah Strutt, a partner of Arkwright. He had served  both in the counting-house and the mill and had had every opportunity to  learn the whole business.    Soon after attaining his majority, he landed in New York, November,  1789, and found employment. From New York he wrote to Moses Brown of  Pawtucket, offering his services, and that old Quaker, though not giving  him much encouragement, invited him to Pawtucket to see whether he could  run the spindles which Brown had bought from the men of Providence. \"If  thou canst do what thou sayest,\" wrote Brown, \"I invite thee to come to  Rhode Island.\"    Arriving in Pawtucket in January, 1790, Slater pronounced the machines  worthless, but convinced Almy and Brown that he knew his business, and  they took him into partnership. He had no drawings or models of the  English machinery, except such as were in his head, but he proceeded to  build machines, doing much of the work himself. On December 20, 1790, he  had ready carding, drawing, and roving machines and seventy-two spindles  in two frames. The water-wheel of an old fulling mill furnished the  power--and the machinery ran.    Here then was the birth of the spinning industry in the United States.  The \"Old Factory,\" as it was to be called for nearly a hundred years,  was built at Pawtucket in 1793. Five years later Slater and others built  a second mill, and in 1806, after Slater had brought out his brother  to share his prosperity, he built another. Workmen came to work for  him solely to learn his machines, and then left him to set up for  themselves. The knowledge he had brought soon became widespread. Mills  were built not only in New England but in other States. In 1809  there were sixty-two spinning mills in operation in the country, with  thirty-one thousand spindles; twenty-five more mills were building or  projected, and the industry was firmly established in the United States.  The yarn was sold to housewives for domestic use or else to professional  weavers who made cloth for sale. This practice was continued for years,  not only in New England, but also in those other parts of the country  where spinning machinery had been introduced.    By 1810, however, commerce and the fisheries had produced considerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#11)"],[1,"commenced. A very ingenious smith (CAMPION), who was seeking      employment, was secured by my brother, and a temporary forge erected      in an upstairs room.\"    The sale of these telescopes of HERSCHEL'S must have produced a large  sum, for he had made before 1795 more than two hundred seven-feet, one  hundred and fifty ten-feet, and eighty twenty-feet mirrors. For many of  the telescopes sent abroad no stands were constructed. The mirrors and  eye-pieces alone were furnished, and a drawing of the stand sent with  them by which the mirrors could be mounted.    In 1785 the cost of a seven-foot telescope, six and four-tenths inches  aperture, stand, eye-pieces, etc., complete, was two hundred guineas, a  ten-foot was six hundred guineas, and a twenty-foot about 2,500 to 3,000  guineas. He had made four ten-foot telescopes like this for the king.  In 1787 SCHROETER got the mirrors and eye-pieces only for a  four-and-three-quarter-inch reflector for five guineas; those for his  seven-foot telescope were twenty-three guineas. Later a seven-foot  telescope, complete, was sold for one hundred guineas, and the  twenty-five-foot reflector, made for the Madrid observatory, cost them  75,000 francs = $15,000.[19] It was ordered in 1796, but not delivered  for several years, the Spanish government being short of money. For a  ten and a seven foot telescope, the Prince of Canino paid L2,310.    VON MAGELLAN writes to BODE concerning a visit to HERSCHEL:[20]        \"I spent the night of the 6th of January at HERSCHEL'S, in Datchet,      near Windsor, and had the good luck to hit on a fine evening. He has      his twenty-foot Newtonian telescope in the open air and mounted in      his garden very simply and conveniently. It is moved by an      assistant, who stands below it. . . . Near the instrument is a clock      regulated to sidereal time. . . . In the room near it sits HERSCHEL'S      sister, and she has FLAMSTEED'S Atlas open before her. As he gives      her the word, she writes down the declination and right ascension      and the other circumstances of the observation. In this way      HERSCHEL examines the whole sky without omitting the least part. He      commonly observes with a magnifying power of one hundred and fifty,      and is sure that after four or five years he will have passed in      review every object above our horizon. He showed me the book in      which his observations up to this time are written, and I am      astonished at the great number of them. Each sweep covers 2 deg. 15'      in declination, and he lets each star pass at least three times through      the field of his telescope, so that it is impossible that anything      can escape him. He has already found about 900 double stars and      almost as many nebulae. I went to bed about one o'clock, and up to      that time, he had found that night four or five new nebulae. The      thermometer in the garden stood at 13 deg. Fahrenheit; but, in spite of      this, HERSCHEL observes the whole night through, except that he      stops every three or four hours and goes in the room for a few      moments. For some years HERSCHEL has observed the heavens every hour      when the weather is clear, and this always in the open air, because      he says that the telescope only performs well when it is at the same      temperature as the air. He protects himself against the weather by      putting on more clothing. He has an excellent constitution, and      thinks about nothing else in the world but the celestial bodies. He      has promised me in the most cordial way, entirely in the service of      astronomy, and without thinking of his own interest, to see to the      telescopes I have ordered for European observatories, and he will      himself attend to the preparation of the mirrors.\"    It was at this time, 1783, May 8, that HERSCHEL married. His wife was  the daughter of Mr. JAMES BALDWIN, a merchant of the city of London, and  the widow of JOHN PITT, Esq. She is described as a lady of singular  amiability and gentleness of character. She was entirely interested in  his scientific pursuits, and the jointure which she brought removed all  further anxiety about money affairs. They had but one child, JOHN  FREDERICK WILLIAM, born March 7, 1792.[21]           *       *       *       *       *    The house at Datchet became more and more unfit for the needs of the  family, and in June, 1785, a move was made to Clay Hall, in Old Windsor.  The residence here was but short, and finally a last change was made to  Slough on April, 3d, 1786.    The ardor of the work during these years can be judged of by a single  sentence from CAROLINA HERSCHEL'S diary:        \"The last night at Clay Hall was spent in sweeping till daylight,      and by the next evening the telescope stood ready for observation at      Slough.\"    From 1786 until his death, HERSCHEL remained at Slough; his life, truly  speaking, was in his observatory.    It is indeed true, as ARAGO has said in his eloquent tribute to him: \"On  peut dire hardiment du jardin et de la petite maison de Slough, que  c'est le lieu du monde ou il a ete fait le plus de decouvertes. Le nom  de ce village ne perira pas; les sciences le transmettront  religieusement a nos derniers neveux.\"    HERSCHEL'S first contribution to the _Philosophical Transactions_ was  printed in the volume for 1780, his last in that for 1818. Of these  thirty-nine volumes, there are only two (1813 and 1817) which contain no  paper from his hand, and many volumes contain more than one, as he  published no less than sixty-eight memoirs in this place.    And yet it must not be thought that his was an austere and grave  existence. Music, which he loved to enthusiasm, was still a delight to  him. All the more that his devotion was free. The glimpses which we get  of his life with his friends show him always cheerful, ardent, and  devoted. Even in his later years, he had not lost a \"boyish earnestness  to explain;\" his simplicity and the charm of his manner struck every  one.    \"HERSCHEL, you know, and everybody knows, is one of the most pleasing  and well-bred natural characters of the present age,\" says Dr. BURNEY,  who had opportunity to know.    The portrait which is given in the frontispiece must have been painted  about this time (1788), and the eager, ardent face shows his inner life  far better than any words can do.    Even in his scientific writings, which everything conspired to render  grave and sober, the almost poetic nature of his mind shows forth. In  one of his (unpublished) note-books, now in the Royal Society's library,  I found this entry:        \"640th Sweep--November 28, 1786.--The nebula of _Orion_, which I saw      by the front view, was so glaring and beautiful that I could not      think of taking any place of its extent.\"    He was quite alone under the perfectly silent sky when this was written,  and he was at his post simply to make this and other such observations.  But the sky was beautiful to him, and his faithful sister, CAROLINA,  sitting below, has preserved for us the words as they dropped from his  lips.    On the 11th of January, 1787, HERSCHEL discovered two satellites to  _Uranus_.    After he had well assured himself of their existence, but before he  communicated his discovery to the world, he made this crucial test. He  prepared a sketch of _Uranus_ attended by his two satellites, as it  would appear on the night of February 10, 1787, and when the night  came, \"the heavens displayed the original of my drawings, by showing in  the situation I had delineated them _the Georgian planet attended by two  satellites_. I confess that this scene appeared to me with additional  beauty, as the little secondary planets seemed to give a dignity to the  primary one which raises it into a more conspicuous situation among the  great bodies of the solar system.\". . .    In a memoir of 1789, he has a few sentences which show the living way  in which the heavens appeared to him:        \"This method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them into a new      kind of light.        \"They are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden, which contains      the greatest variety of productions in different flourishing beds;      and one advantage we may at least reap from it is, that we can, as      it were, extend the range of our experience to an immense duration.      For is it not almost the same thing whether we live successively to      witness the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity, fading,      withering, and corruption of a plant, or whether a vast number of      specimens selected from every stage through which the plant passes      in the course of its existence be brought at once to our view?\"    The thought here is no less finely expressed than it is profound. The  simile is perfect, if we have the power to separate among the vast  variety each state of being from every other, and if the very luxuriance  of illustration in the heavens does not bewilder and overpower the mind.  It was precisely this discriminating power that HERSCHEL possessed in  perfection.    There is a kind of humor in the way he records a change of opinion:        \"I formerly supposed the surface of _Saturn's_ ring to be rough,      owing to luminous points like mountains seen on it, till one of      these was kind enough to venture off the edge of the ring and appear      as a satellite.\"    In 1782 he replies with a certain concealed sharpness to the idea that  he used magnifying powers which were too high. There is a tone almost of  impatience, as if he were conscious he was replying to a criticism based  on ignorance:        \"We are told that we gain nothing by magnifying too much. I grant      it; but shall never believe I magnify too much till by experience I      find that I can see better with a lower power.\" (1782.)    By 1786, when he returns to this subject, in answer to a formal request  to explain his use of high"]]]
