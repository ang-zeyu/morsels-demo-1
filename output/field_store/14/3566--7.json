[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#11)"],[1,". The few really untrue and unscrupulous things I have seen  in American 'stories' have always been in the headlines. And the  headlines are written by somebody else; some solitary and savage cynic  locked up in the office, hating all mankind, and raging and revenging  himself at random, while the neat, polite, and rational pressman can  safely be let loose to wander about the town.    For instance, I talked to two decidedly thoughtful fellow journalists  immediately on my arrival at a town in which there had been some labour  troubles. I told them my general view of Labour in the very largest and  perhaps the vaguest historical outline; pointing out that the one great  truth to be taught to the middle classes was that Capitalism was itself  a crisis, and a passing crisis; that it was not so much that it was  breaking down as that it had never really stood up. Slaveries could  last, and peasantries could last; but wage-earning communities could  hardly even live, and were already dying.    All this moral and even metaphysical generalisation was most fairly and  most faithfully reproduced by the interviewer, who had actually heard it  casually and idly spoken. But on the top of this column of political  philosophy was the extraordinary announcement in enormous letters,  'Chesterton Takes Sides in Trolley Strike.' This was inaccurate. When I  spoke I not only did not know that there was any trolley strike, but I  did not know what a trolley strike was. I should have had an indistinct  idea that a large number of citizens earned their living by carrying  things about in wheel-barrows, and that they had desisted from the  beneficent activities. Any one who did not happen to be a journalist, or  know a little about journalism, American and English, would have  supposed that the same man who wrote the article had suddenly gone mad  and written the title. But I know that we have here to deal with two  different types of journalists; and the man who writes the headlines I  will not dare to describe; for I have not seen him except in dreams.    Another innocent complication is that the interviewer does sometimes  translate things into his native language. It would not seem odd that a  French interviewer should translate them into French; and it is certain  that the American interviewer sometimes translates them into American.  Those who imagine the two languages to be the same are more innocent  than any interviewer. To take one out of the twenty examples, some of  which I have mentioned elsewhere, suppose an interviewer had said that I  had the reputation of being a nut. I should be flattered but faintly  surprised at such a tribute to my dress and dashing exterior. I should  afterwards be sobered and enlightened by discovering that in America a  nut does not mean a dandy but a defective or imbecile person. And as I  have here to translate their American phrase into English, it may be  very defensible that they should translate my English phrases into  American. Anyhow they often do translate them into American. In answer  to the usual question about Prohibition I had made the usual answer,  obvious to the point of dullness to those who are in daily contact with  it, that it is a law that the rich make knowing they can always break  it. From the printed interview it appeared that I had said,  'Prohibition! All matter of dollar sign.' This is almost avowed  translation, like a French translation. Nobody can suppose that it would  come natural to an Englishman to talk about a dollar, still less about a  dollar sign--whatever that may be. It is exactly as if he had made me  talk about the Skelt and Stevenson Toy Theatre as 'a cent plain, and two  cents coloured' or condemned a parsimonious policy as dime-wise and  dollar-foolish. Another interviewer once asked me who was the greatest  American writer. I have forgotten exactly what I said, but after  mentioning several names, I said that the greatest natural genius and  artistic force was probably Walt Whitman. The printed interview is more  precise; and students of my literary and conversational style will be  interested to know that I said, 'See here, Walt Whitman was your one  real red-blooded man.' Here again I hardly think the translation can  have been quite unconscious; most of my intimates are indeed aware that  I do not talk like that, but I fancy that the same fact would have  dawned on the journalist to whom I had been talking. And even this  trivial point carries with it the two truths which must be, I fear, the  rather monotonous moral of these pages. The first is that America and  England can be far better friends when sharply divided than when  shapelessly amalgamated. These two journalists were false reporters, but  they were true translators. They were not so much interviewers as  interpreters. And the second is that in any such difference it is often  wholesome to look beneath the surface for a superiority. For ability to  translate does imply ability to understand; and many of these  journalists really did understand. I think there are many English  journalists who would be more puzzled by so simple an idea as the  plutocratic foundation of Prohibition. But the American knew at once  that I meant it was a matter of dollar sign; probably because he knew  very well that it is.    Then again there is a curious convention by which American interviewing  makes itself out much worse than it is. The reports are far more rowdy  and insolent than the conversations. This is probably a part of the fact  that a certain vivacity, which to some seems vitality and to some  vulgarity, is not only an ambition but an ideal. It must always be  grasped that this vulgarity is an ideal even more than it is a reality.  It is an ideal when it is not a reality. A very quiet and intelligent  young man, in a soft black hat and tortoise-shell spectacles, will ask  for an interview with unimpeachable politeness, wait for his living  subject with unimpeachable patience, talk to him quite sensibly for  twenty minutes, and go noiselessly away. Then in the newspaper next  morning you will read how he beat the bedroom door in, and pursued his  victim on to the roof or dragged him from under the bed, and tore from  him replies to all sorts of bald and ruthless questions printed in large  black letters. I was often interviewed in the evening, and had no notion  of how atrociously I had been insulted till I saw it in the paper next  morning. I had no notion I had been on the rack of an inquisitor until I  saw it in plain print; and then of course I believed it, with a faith  and docility unknown in any previous epoch of history. An interesting  essay might be written upon points upon which nations affect more vices  than they possess; and it might deal more fully with the American  pressman, who is a harmless clubman in private, and becomes a sort of  highway-robber in print.    I have turned this chapter into something like a defence of  interviewers, because I really think they are made to bear too much of  the burden of the bad developments of modern journalism. But I am very  far from meaning to suggest that those bad developments are not very  bad. So far from wishing to minimise the evil, I would in a real sense  rather magnify it. I would suggest that the evil itself is a much larger  and more fundamental thing; and that to deal with it by abusing poor  journalists, doing their particular and perhaps peculiar duty, is like  dealing with a pestilence by rubbing at one of the spots. What is wrong  with the modern world will not be righted by attributing the whole  disease to each of its symptoms in turn; first to the tavern and then to  the cinema and then to the reporter's room. The evil of journalism is  not in the journalists. It is not in the poor men on the lower level of  the profession, but in the rich men at the top of the profession; or  rather in the rich men who are too much on top of the profession even to  belong to it. The trouble with newspapers is the Newspaper Trust, as the  trouble might be with a Wheat Trust, without involving a vilification of  all the people who grow wheat. It is the American plutocracy and not the  American press. What is the matter with the modern world is not modern  headlines or modern films or modern machinery. What is the matter with  the modern world is the modern world; and the cure will come from  another.          _Some American Cities_      There is one point, almost to be called a paradox, to be noted about New  York; and that is that in one sense it is really new. The term very  seldom has any relevance to the reality. The New Forest is nearly as old  as the Conquest, and the New Theology is nearly as old as the Creed.  Things have been offered to me as the new thought that might more  properly be called the old thoughtlessness; and the thing we call the  New Poor Law is already old enough to know better. But there is a sense  in which New York is always new; in the sense that it is always being  renewed. A stranger might well say that the chief industry of the  citizens consists of destroying their city; but he soon realises that  they always start it all over again with undiminished energy and hope.  At first I had a fancy that they never quite finished putting up a big  building without feeling that it was time to pull it down again; and  that somebody began to dig up the first foundations while somebody else  was putting on the last tiles. This fills the whole of this brilliant  and bewildering place with a quite unique and unparalleled air of rapid  ruin. Ruins spring up so suddenly like mushrooms, which with us are the  growth of age like mosses, that one half expects to see ivy climbing  quickly up the broken walls as in the nightmare of the Time Machine, or  in some incredibly accelerated cinema.

That was my last outing with Hauptmann in the textile regions. A few  months later I visited him at his home, located in the woods, close to  the edge of a mountain.    Still later, when I was serving a term of imprisonment at the  Schweidnitzer prison for my sins in exercising too much freedom of the  press, I was overjoyed one morning by the news that Hauptmann had sent  me a box of books. Through his kindness, Gottfried Keller, Konrad  Ferdinand Meyer and other authors have illumined many dreary days of my  cell life.    All the books reached me safely but the \"Weavers,\" which had just been  published at that time, and that I could not get hold of, in spite of  every effort. The inspector had strict orders to consider that book as  contraband.    Every time I went into the office to change one book for another, I saw  the \"Weavers\" on the table. The temptation to shove the book under my  jacket at an opportune moment was very great and trying, but  unfortunately the State Attorney had instilled the idea into the head of  the inspector that it was a very dangerous work; he never took his eyes  from it.    Gerhart Hauptmann remained to the Schweidnitzer prison administration  the most dangerous, prohibited author.    [Illustration]          DISAPPOINTED ECONOMISTS.      Teachers and economists represent the bees as models of diligence.  Behold how these little hard workers gather the honey together! Not a  sign of obstinacy. They never insist on a certain number of hours for  their workday, nor do they crave time for leisure, meditation or rest.  Indeed, they employ all their energies, so that the owner of the beehive  shall gain high profits.    No matter if they gather a thousandfold as much honey as they can  consume, they never seek iniquity. Man takes all their wealth from them,  and in the spring, in the beautiful month of May, when the flower cups  begin to fill, the little hustlers resume their work again without  complaint and without murmur.    Probably some economists regret that workmen are not endowed by nature  with such an instinct for work as would let them feel nothing else but  the desire to accumulate wealth for others.    It is too bad, indeed, that house builders, railroad workers, miners,  garment workers and farmers are creatures with thinking faculties. That  they should be able to analyze, to compare, to draw conclusions is  really very unfortunate for the \"Captains of Industry.\"    Next to the bee, the Asiatic coolie is the favorite ideal of the  every-day economist. In one respect he surpasses the bee--he does not  destroy drones.    How smoothly everything might run along in this world of material  supremacy, if only the workers were made up of such a desirable mixture  as the bees and coolies.    Fortunately, Fate hath not willed it so.    [Illustration]          VITAL ART.    ANNY MALI HICKS.      IN order to estimate the value of any movement, whether social,  economic, ethical or esthetic, it must be studied in its relation and  attitude to general progress. Its effectiveness should be judged by what  it contributes to the growth of the universal conscience. That \"no man  liveth unto himself alone\" is never so true as now, because now it is  more generally realized. Therefore, any expression which concerns itself  solely with its own special field of action finds itself soon set aside,  and presently becoming divorced from reality, ends as a sporadic type.  Any expression, however, which responds to the larger life gains a  vitality which insures its continuance.    Thus, the effort to apply certain truths not new in themselves, is a  tendency to work in harmony with progress. The effort to apply  principle, however imperfectly expressed, is important, not because of  its results, but because of the desire to relate theory and action in a  conduct of life. Almost every type of expression is undergoing its phase  of application. Esthetics have somewhat aligned themselves to the  others, but at last there is a movement, known as the arts and crafts  movement, more properly called applied esthetics, which is the effort to  relate art to life. The old banality, \"Art for Art's sake,\" is obsolete,  and the vital meaning of art is in a more rational and beautiful  expression of life, as it were, the continent art of living well.    This is the ideal and educational aspect of applied esthetics. Within  the limits of its exclusive circle and within the radius of its special  activities there is a trend to contentment with the production of  objects of \"worth and virtue.\" The object of luxury, which in fact has  no vital meaning to either the producer or consumer. Were the production  of such things to be its only aim, it would soon defeat its own end. But  this movement has in reality wider and more democratic ideals. Because  of its power to stimulate self-expression and the creative impulses, its  greatest and most vital influence is more social than artistic. It  principally concerns itself with the desire of the worker to express in  his work whatever impulse for beauty may be his. There is no surer way  of feeling the pressure of present economic conditions. The value of  applied esthetics is as a medicine to stir up social unrest and  discontent. Its keynote is self-expression, and it is when men and women  begin to think and act for themselves that they most keenly feel social  and economic restrictions, and are made to suffer under them. But if  suffering is necessary to growth, let us have it and have it over with  by all means. No sane being will stand much of it without making an  effort to get at its cause. It has been said that the most important  part of progress is to make people think; it is vastly more important  that they should feel. The average individual is not discontented with  his surroundings, else he would go to work to change them. As a product  of them he is benumbed by their mechanical influence, and consequently  expresses himself within their limits. He is the mouthpiece of existing  conditions, and, accordingly, acts in law-abiding fashion.    The larger emotional life, or inner social impulse emanates from those  pioneers who, living beyond existing conditions, are the dynamics of  society. Through them life pushes onward. The inner impulse becomes  public opinion, public opinion becomes custom, custom crystallizes into  law. Now the fresh impulse is needed for new growth; where shall it be  sought if not in the expression of the emotional life? What form shall  the expression take unless it be the purest and most spontaneous form of  art, which is without purpose other than the expression of an impulse?  This alone fosters the growth of the emotions.    Art, like justice, has many crimes committed in its name, and much  called so that is merely a methodical and imitative performance. It is  in no wise that spontaneous expression of life which, coming simply and  directly as an impulse, takes a decorative or applied form. All the  beginnings of art grew up in this way. In primitive peoples it is the  first expression of emotional life, which comes after the material need  is satisfied. The savage makes his spade or fish spear from the  necessity of physical preservation. Thus from the joy of living he  applies to it his feeling for beauty.    The earliest forms of art were all applied. Stone carving was applied to  architecture, thus colored stones, called mosaics, as wall decorations;  from these to the fresco; from the fresco to the pictorial form of  painting. To-day the final degeneration of art is in the easel picture,  which as an object detached and disassociated from its surroundings,  takes refuge in the story-telling phase to justify its _raison d'etre_.  But, alas for the easel picture! alas, also, for the usual illustration,  without which most literature would be so difficult to understand. In  each case the one is there to help out the other's deficiency. Two  important expressions of art, in a state of insubordination. It is the  opera over again, where music and drama keep up an undignified race for  prominence. Supposing an illustration were decorative in character  echoing in a minor manner the suggested theme, would that not be a  fitting background for the story-telling art? The Greeks knew very well  what they were about when they introduced the relatively subordinate but  decoratively important chorus into their dramas. This as well expresses  their sense of relative proportion as does their sculpture and  architecture.    What is decorative art, if not a sense of beauty applied to objects of  use? That these need the emotional element as well as their element of  service is as essential as the life breath in the body. It is the spark  of divine fire which relates the actual to the ideal, resulting in the  reality. It removes from our surroundings any influence which is solely  mechanical. Applied art is alike because of its association with that  which is necessary to life.    The test is necessity, not alone the physical, but likewise the  emotional necessity, for all sides of our nature must be developed if  life is to have full meaning and come to its maturity. The influence of  applied esthetics is more vital because it is unconsciously absorbed  through constant association. Imagine surroundings where everything  which did not have a distinct use were eliminated and where everything  else was distinctly fitted to its use. If this were put into practice in  the usual household, a certain simplicity would be the result, to say  the least. Most things with which we surround ourselves are neither  useful nor beautiful. They are either so absurdly over-ornamented as to  have their usefulness completely impaired, or else they are the usual  mechanical device equally complicated and hideous.
