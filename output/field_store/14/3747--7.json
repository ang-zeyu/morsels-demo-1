Many of them are head-hunters. But they have suffered cruelly from the  coast Dyaks, with whom, as your excellency has said, they have an  eternal feud.\"    \"They are pests,\" the governor snarled. \"They keep the lowlands in a  continual turmoil with their raids. We cannot grow a blade of rice on  account of them.\"    \"That is where your excellency and I must disagree,\" Peter Gross  asserted quietly.    \"Ha!\" the governor exclaimed incredulously. \"What do you say, Mynheer  Gross?\"    \"Your excellency, living in Batavia, you have seen only one side of this  question, the side your underlings have shown you. With your  excellency's permission I shall show you another side, the side a  stranger, unprejudiced, with no axes to grind either way, saw in his  eight years of sailoring about these islands. Have I your excellency's  permission?\"    A frown gathered on the governor's face. His thin lips curled, and his  bristly mane rose belligerently.    \"Proceed,\" he snapped.    Peter Gross rested his elbows on the table and leaned toward the  governor.    \"Your excellency,\" he began, \"let it be understood that I bring no  accusations to-night; that we are speaking as man to man. I go to  Bulungan to inquire into the truth of the things I have heard. Whatever  I learn shall be faithfully reported to your excellency.\"    Van Schouten nodded curtly.    \"Your excellency has spoken of the unrest in Bulungan,\" Peter Gross  continued. \"Your excellency also spoke of piracies committed in these  seas. It is my belief, your excellency, that the government has been  mistaken in assuming that there is no connection between the two. I am  satisfied that there is a far closer union and a better understanding  between the Dyaks and the pirates than has ever been dreamed of here in  Batavia.\"    The governor smiled derisively.    \"You are mistaken, Mynheer Gross,\" he contradicted. \"I almost believed  so, too, at one time, and I had Captain Van Slyck, our commandant at  Bulungan, investigate for me. I have his report here. I shall be glad to  let you read it.\"    He tapped a gong. In a moment Sachsen bustled in.    \"Sachsen,\" the governor said, \"Kapitein Van Slyck's report on the  pirates of the straits, if you please.\"    Sachsen bowed and withdrew.    \"I shall be glad to read the captain's report,\" Peter Gross assured  gravely. A grimly humorous twinkle lurked in his eyes. The governor was  quick to note it.    \"But it will not convince you, eh, _mynheer_?\" he challenged. He smiled.  \"You Yankees are an obstinate breed--almost as stubborn as we Dutch.\"    \"I am afraid that the captain's report will not cover things I know,\"  Peter Gross replied. \"Yet I have no doubt it will be helpful.\"    The subtle irony his voice expressed caused the governor to look at him  quizzically, but Van Schouten was restrained from further inquiry by the  return of Sachsen with the report. The governor glanced at the  superscription and handed the document to Peter Gross with the remark:  \"Read that at your leisure. I will have Sachsen make you a copy.\"    Peter Gross pocketed the report with a murmured word of thanks. The  governor frowned, trying to recollect where the thread of conversation  had been broken, and then remarked:    \"As I say, Mynheer Gross, I am sure you will find yourself mistaken. The  Dyaks are thieves and head-hunters, a treacherous breed. They do not  know the meaning of loyalty--God help us if they did! No two villages  have ever yet worked together for a common aim. As for the pirates, they  are wolves that prey on everything that comes in their path. Some of the  _orang kayas_ may be friendly with them, but as for there being any  organization--bah! it is too ridiculous to even discuss it.\"    Peter Gross's lips pressed a little tighter.    \"Your excellency,\" he replied with perfect equanimity, \"you have your  opinion and I have mine. My work in Bulungan, I hope, will show which  of us is right. Yet I venture to say this. Before I have left Bulungan I  shall be able to prove to your excellency that one man, not so very far  from your excellency's _paleis_ at this moment, has united the majority  of the sea Dyaks and the pirates into a formidable league of which he is  the head. More than this, he has established a system of espionage which  reaches into this very house.\"    Van Schouten stared at Peter Gross in amazement and incredulity.    \"Mynheer Gross,\" he finally exclaimed, \"this is nonsense!\"    Peter Gross's eyes flashed. \"Your excellency,\" he retorted, \"it is the  truth.\"    \"What proofs have you?\" the governor demanded.    \"None at present that could convince your excellency,\" Peter Gross  admitted frankly. \"All I have is a cumulative series of instances,  unrelated in themselves, scraps of conversations picked up here and  there, little things that have come under my observation in my sojourns  in many ports of the archipelago. But in Bulungan I expect to get the  proofs. When I have them, I shall give them to your excellency, that  justice may be done. Until then I make no charges. All I say is--guard  carefully what you would not have your enemies know.\"    \"This is extraordinary,\" the governor remarked, impressed by Peter  Gross's intense earnestness. \"Surely you do not expect me to believe all  this on your unsupported word, _mynheer_?\"    \"The best corroboration which I can offer is that certain matters which  your excellency thought were known only to himself are now common gossip  from Batavia to New Guinea,\" Peter Gross replied.    The governor's head drooped. His face became drawn. Lines formed where  none had been before. The jauntiness, the pompous self-assurance, and  the truculence that so distinguished him among his fellows disappeared  from his mien; it was as though years of anxiety and care had suddenly  passed over him.    \"This discussion brings us nowhere, Mynheer Gross,\" he wearily remarked.  \"Let us decide how large a force you should have. What you have told me  convinces me the more that you will need at least two hundred men. I  hesitate to send you with less than a regiment.\"    \"Let me deal with this situation in my own way, your excellency,\" Peter  Gross pleaded. \"I believe that just dealing will win the confidence of  the upland Dyaks. Once that is done, the rest is easy. Twenty-five men,  backed by the garrison at Bulungan and the hill Dyaks, will be able to  break up the pirate bands, if the navy does its share. After that the  problem is one of administration, to convince the coast Dyaks that the  state is fair, that the state is just, and that the state's first  thought is the welfare of her people, be they brown, black, or white.\"    \"You think twenty-five men can do all that?\" the governor asked  doubtfully.    \"The men I shall choose can, your excellency. They will be men whom I  can trust absolutely, who have no interests except the service of Peter  Gross.\"    \"Where will you find them, _mynheer_?\"    \"Here in Java, your excellency. Americans. Sailors who have left the  sea. Men who came here to make their fortunes and failed and are too  proud to go back home. Soldiers from the Philippines, adventurers, lads  disappointed in love. I could name you a dozen such here in Batavia  now.\"    The governor looked at his new lieutenant long and thoughtfully.    \"Do as you deem best, _mynheer_. It may be God has sent you here to  teach us why we have failed. Is there anything else you need, besides  the usual stores?\"    \"There is one more request I wish to make of your excellency,\" Peter  Gross replied.    \"And that is--\"    \"That your excellency cancel the reward offered for the arrest of  Leveque's daughter.\"    Van Schouten stroked his brow with a gesture of infinite weariness.    \"You make strange requests, _mynheer_,\" he observed. \"Yet I am moved to  trust you. What you ask shall be done.\"    He rose to signify that the interview was at an end. \"You may make your  requisitions through Sachsen, _mynheer_. God speed you and give you  wisdom beyond your years.\"          CHAPTER VII    MYNHEER MULLER WORRIES      Seated in a low-framed rattan chair on the broad veranda of his cottage,  Mynheer Hendrik Muller, _controlleur_, and acting resident of Bulungan,  awaited in perspiring impatience the appearance of his military  associate, Captain Gerrit Van Slyck.    State regulations required daily conferences, that the civil arm of the  government might lay its commands upon the military and the military  make its requisitions upon the civil. An additional incentive to prompt  attendance upon these was that _mynheer_ the resident rarely failed to  produce a bottle of Hollands, which, compounded with certain odorous and  acidulated products of the tropics, made a drink that cooled the fevered  brow and mellowed the human heart, made a hundred and twenty in the  shade seem like seventy, and chased away the home-sickness of folk  pining for the damp and fog of their native Amsterdam.    It was no urgent affair of state, however, that made Muller fume and  fuss like a washerwoman on a rainy Monday at Van Slyck's dilatoriness. A  bit of gossip, casually dropped by the master of a trading schooner who  had called for clearance papers an hour before, was responsible for his  agitation.    \"When does your new resident arrive?\" the visiting skipper had asked.    \"The new resident?\" Muller returned blankly. \"What new resident?\"    The skipper perceived that he was the bearer of unpleasant tidings and  diplomatically minimized the importance of his news.    \"Somebody down to Batavia told me you were going to have a new resident  here,\" he replied lightly. \"It's only talk, I s'pose. You hear so many  yarns in port.\"    \"There is nothing official--yet,\" Muller declared. He had the air of one  who could tell much if he chose. But when the sailor had gone back to  his ship he hurriedly sent Cho Seng to the stockade"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#11)"],[1,"of Charlemagne as a great warrior and a wise emperor spread  all over the world. Many kings sent messengers to him to ask his  friendship, and bring him presents. Harun-al-Rashid (_hah-roon'  al rash'-eed_), the famous caliph, who lived at Bagdad, in Asia,  sent him an elephant and a clock which struck the hours.    The Franks were much astonished at the sight of the elephant; for  they had never seen one before. They also wondered much at the  clock. In those days there were in Europe no clocks such as we  have; but water-clocks and hour-glasses were used in some places.  The water-clock was a vessel into which water was allowed to trickle.  It contained a float which pointed to a scale of hours at the side  of the vessel. The float gradually rose as the water trickled in.    The hour-glasses measured time by the falling of fine sand from  the top to the bottom of a glass vessel made with a narrow neck in  the middle for the sand to go through. They were like the little  glasses called egg-timers, which are used for measuring the time  for boiling eggs.    [Illustration: CHARLEMAGNE]    Charlemagne died in 814. He was buried in the church which he had  built at Aix-la-Chapelle. His body was placed in the tomb, seated  upon a grand chair, dressed in royal robes, with a crown on the  head, a sword at the side, and a Bible in the hands.    This famous emperor is known in history as Charlemagne, which is  the French word for the German name Karl der Grosse (_Charles the  Great_), the name by which he was called at his own court during  his life. The German name would really be a better name for him;  for he was a German, and German was the language that he spoke.  The common name of his favorite residence, Aix-la-Chapelle, also  is French, but he knew the place as Aachen (_ae'chen_).    The great empire which Charlemagne built up held together only  during the life of his son. Then it was divided among his three  grandsons. Louis took the eastern part, Lo-thaire' took the central  part, with the title of emperor, and Charles took the western part.          HARUN-AL-RASHID    CALIPH FROM 786-809 A.D.    I    The most celebrated of all Mohammedan caliphs was Harun-al-Rashid,  which means, in English, Aaron the Just. Harun is the hero of several  of the stories of the \"Arabian Nights,\" a famous book, which perhaps  you have read. There are many curious and wonderful tales in it.    When Harun was only eighteen years old he showed such courage and  skill as a soldier that his father, who was then caliph, allowed  him to lead an army against the enemies of the Mohammedans; and  he won many great victories.    He afterwards commanded an army of ninety-five thousand Arabs and  Persians, sent by his father to invade the Eastern Roman Empire,  which was then ruled by the Empress Irene (_i-re'ne_). After defeating  Irene's famous general, Nicetas (_ni-ce'tas_), Harun marched his  army to Chrys-op'o-lis, now Scutari (_skoo'ta-re_), on the Asiatic  coast, opposite Constantinople. He encamped on the heights, in  full view of the Roman capital.    The Empress saw that the city would certainly by taken by the Moslems.  She therefore sent ambassadors to Harun to arrange terms; but he  sternly refused to agree to anything except immediate surrender.    Then one of the ambassadors said, \"The Empress has heard much of  your ability as a general. Though you are her enemy, she admires  you as a soldier.\"    These flattering words were pleasing to Harun. He walked to and  fro in front of his tent and then spoke again to the ambassadors.    \"Tell the Empress,\" he said, \"that I will spare Constantinople  if she will pay me seventy thousand pieces of gold as a yearly  tribute. If the tribute is regularly paid Constantinople shall not  be harmed by any Moslem force.\"    The Empress had to agree to these terms. She paid the first year's  tribute; and soon the great Moslem army set out on its homeward  march.    When Harun was not quite twenty-one years old he became caliph.    He began his reign by appointing very able ministers, who carried  on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved  the condition of the people.    Harun built a palace in Bagdad, far grander and more beautiful  than that of any caliph before him. Here he established his court  and lived in great splendor, attended by hundreds of courtiers  and slaves.    He was very anxious that his people should be treated justly by  the officers of the government; and he was determined to find out  whether any had reason to complain. So he sometimes disguised himself  at night and went about through the streets and bazaars, listening  to the talk of those whom he met and asking them questions. In  this way he learned whether the people were contented and happy,  or not.    In those times Bagdad in the east and the Mohammedan cities of  Spain in the west were famed for their schools and learned men.  Arabian teachers first introduced into Western Europe both algebra  and the figures which we use in arithmetic. It is for this reason  that we call these figures the \"Arabic numerals.\"    Harun-al-Rashid gave great encouragement to learning. He was a  scholar and poet himself and whenever he heard of learned men in  his own kingdom, or in neighboring countries, he invited them to  his court and treated them with respect.    The name of Harun, therefore, became known throughout the world. It  is said that a correspondence took place between him and Charlemagne  and that, as you have learned, Harun sent the great emperor a present  of a clock and an elephant.    [Illustration: THE PRESENTS FROM HARUN-AL-RASHID]    The tribute of gold that the Empress Irene agreed to pay Harun was  sent regularly for many years. It was always received at Bagdad  with great ceremony. The day on which it arrived was made a holiday.  The Roman soldiers who came with it entered the gates in procession.  Moslem troops also took part in the parade.    When the gold had been delivered at the palace, the Roman soldiers  were hospitably entertained, and were escorted to the main gate of  the city when they set out on their journey back to Constantinople.    II    In 802 Ni-ceph'o-rus usurped the throne of the Eastern Empire.  He sent ambassadors with a letter to Harun to tell him that the  tribute would no longer be paid. The letter contained these words:    \"The weak and faint-hearted Irene submitted to pay you tribute.  She ought to have made you pay tribute to her. Return to me all  that she paid you; else the matter must be settled by the sword.\"    As soon as Harun had read these words the ambassadors threw a bundle  of swords at his feet. The caliph smiled, and drawing his own sword,  or cimeter (_sim'e-ter_), he cut the Roman swords in two with one  stroke without injuring the blade, or even turning the edge of  his weapon.    Then he dictated a letter to Nicephorus, in which he said:    \"Harun-al-Rashid, Commander of the Faithful to Nicephorus, the  Roman dog: I have read thy letter. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt  _see_ my reply.\"    [Illustration: HARUN-AL-RASHID]    Harun was as good as his word. He started that day with a large  army to punish the emperor. As soon as he reached Roman territory  he ravaged the country and took possession of everything valuable  that he found. He laid siege to Her-a-cle'a, a city on the shores  of the Black Sea, and in a week forced it to surrender. Then he  sacked the place.    Nicephorus was now forced to agree to pay the tribute. Scarcely,  however, had the caliph reached his palace in Bagdad when the emperor  again refused to pay.    Harun, consequently, advanced into the Roman province of Phrygia,  in Asia Minor, with an army of 15,000 men. Nicepherus marched against  him with 125,000 men. In the battle which followed the emperor was  wounded, and 40,000 of his men were killed.    After this defeat Nicephorus again promised payment of the tribute,  but again failed to keep his promise.    Harun now vowed that he would kill the emperor if he should ever  lay hands upon him. But as he was getting ready to march once more  into the Roman provinces a revolt broke out in one of the cities  of his own kingdom; and while on his way to suppress it the great  caliph died of an illness which had long given him trouble.          EGBERT    KING FROM 802-837 A.D.    I    Egbert the Saxon lived at the same time as did Harun-al-Rashid  and Charlemagne. He was the first king who ruled all England as  one kingdom. Long before his birth the people who are known to  us as Britons lived there, and they gave to the island the name  Britain.    But Britain was invaded by the Romans under Julius Caesar and his  successors, and all that part of it which we now call England was  added to the Empire of Rome. The Britons were driven into Wales  and Cornwall, the western sections of the island.    The Romans kept possession of the island for nearly four hundred  years. They did not leave it until 410, the year that Alaric sacked  the city of Rome. At this time the Roman legions were withdrawn  from Britain.    Some years before this the Saxons, Angles and Jutes, German tribes,  had settled near the shores of the North Sea. They learned much  about Britain; for trading vessels, even at that early day, crossed  the Channel. Among other things, the men from the north learned  that Britain was crossed with good Roman roads, and dotted with  houses of brick and stone; that walled cities had taken the place  of tented camps, and that the country for miles round each city  was green every spring with waving wheat, or white with orchard  blossoms.    [Illustration: HENGIST AND HORSA LANDING IN ENGLAND]    After the Roman legions had left Britain, the Jutes, led, it is  said, by two great captains named Hengist and Horsa, landed upon  the southeastern coast and made a settlement.    Britain proved a pleasant place to live in, and soon the Angles  and Saxons also left the North Sea "]]]
