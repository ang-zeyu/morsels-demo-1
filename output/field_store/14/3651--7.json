We could even distinguish upon its northwest side a  deep-cut gorge, which was not visible before. Upon its smooth and perfect  slopes remained only the tatters of its last winter's garments. We could  also look far out over the Sardarbulakh ridge, which connects the two  Ararats, and on which the Cossacks are encamped. It was to them that the  mutessarif had desired us to go, but we had subsequently determined to  make the ascent directly from the Turkish side.      [Illustration: LITTLE ARARAT COMES INTO VIEW.]    Following up this southeast ridge we came at 5:45 P. M. to a point about  eleven thousand feet. Here the thermometer registered 39 deg. Fahrenheit, and  was constantly falling. If we should continue on, the cold during the  night, especially with our scanty clothing, would become intolerable; and  then, too, we could scarcely find a spot level enough to sleep on. We  therefore determined to stop here for the night, and to continue the  ascent at dawn. Some high, rugged crags on the ridge above us attracted  our attention as affording a comparatively protected lodging. Among these  we spread our carpet, and piled stones in the intervening spaces to form a  complete inclosure. Thus busily engaged, we failed for a time to realize  the grandeur of the situation. Over the vast and misty panorama that  spread out before us, the lingering rays of the setting sun shed a tinge  of gold, which was communicated to the snowy beds around us. Behind the  peak of Little Ararat a brilliant rainbow stretched in one grand archway  above the weeping clouds. But this was only one turn of nature's  kaleidoscope. The arch soon faded away, and the shadows lengthened and  deepened across the plain, and mingled, till all was lost to view behind  the falling curtains of the night. The Kurdish tents far down the slope,  and the white curling smoke from their evening camp-fires, we could see no  more; only the occasional bark of a dog was borne upward through the  impenetrable darkness.    Colder and colder grew the atmosphere. From 39 deg. the thermometer gradually  fell to 36 deg., to 33 deg., and during the night dropped below freezing-point.  The snow, which fell from the clouds just over our heads, covered our  frugal supper-table, on which were placed a few hard-boiled eggs, some  tough Turkish bread, cheese, and a bottle of tea mixed with raki. Ice-tea  was no doubt a luxury at this time of the year, but not on Mount Ararat,  at the height of eleven thousand feet, with the temperature at  freezing-point. M. Raffl was as cheerful as could be expected under the  circumstances. He expressed his delight at our progress thus far; and now  that we were free from our \"gentlemen\" attendants, he considered our  chances for success much brighter. We turned in together under our single  blanket, with the old gentleman between us. He had put on every article of  clothing, including gloves, hat, hood, cloak, and heavy shoes. For pillows  we used the provision-bags and camera. The bottle of cold tea we buttoned  up in our coats to prevent it from freezing. On both sides, and above us,  lay the pure white snow; below us a huge abyss, into which the rocky ridge  descended like a darkened stairway to the lower regions. The awful  stillness was unbroken, save by the whistling of the wind among the rocks.  Dark masses of clouds seemed to bear down upon us every now and then,  opening up their trapdoors, and letting down a heavy fall of snow. The  heat of our bodies melted the ice beneath us, and our clothes became  saturated with ice-water. Although we were surrounded by snow and ice, we  were suffering with a burning thirst. Since separating from our companions  we had found no water whatever, while the single bottle of cold tea we had  must be preserved for the morrow. Sleep, under such circumstances, and in  our cramped position, was utterly impossible. At one o'clock the morning  star peeped above the eastern horizon. This we watched hour after hour, as  it rose in unrivaled beauty toward the zenith, until at last it began to  fade away in the first gray streaks of the morning.      [Illustration: THE WALL INCLOSURE FOR OUR BIVOUAC AT ELEVEN THOUSAND    FEET.]    By the light of a flickering candle we ate a hurried breakfast, fastened  on our spiked shoes, and strapped to our backs a few indispensable  articles, leaving the rest of our baggage at the camp until our return.  Just at daybreak, 3:55 A. M., on the 4th of July, we started off on what  proved to be the hardest day's work we had ever accomplished. We struck  out at once across the broad snow-field to the second rock rib on the  right, which seemed to lead up to the only line of rocks above. The  surface of these large snow-beds had frozen during the night, so that we  had to cut steps with our ice-picks to keep from slipping down their  glassy surface. Up this ridge we slowly climbed for three weary hours,  leaping from boulder to boulder, or dragging ourselves up their  precipitous sides. The old gentleman halted frequently to rest, and showed  evident signs of weariness. \"It is hard; we must take it slowly,\" he would  say (in German) whenever our impatience would get the better of our  prudence. At seven o'clock we reached a point about 13,500 feet, beyond  which there seemed to be nothing but the snow-covered slope, with only a  few projecting rocks along the edge of a tremendous gorge which now broke  upon our astonished gaze. Toward this we directed our course, and, an hour  later, stood upon its very verge. Our venerable companion now looked up at  the precipitous slope above us, where only some stray, projecting rocks  were left to guide us through the wilderness of snow. \"Boys,\" said he,  despondently, \"I cannot reach the top; I have not rested during the night,  and I am now falling asleep on my feet; besides, I am very much fatigued.\"  This came almost like a sob from a breaking heart. Although the old  gentleman was opposed to the ascent in the first instance, his old Alpine  spirit arose within him with all its former vigor when once he had started  up the mountain slope; and now, when almost in sight of the very goal, his  strength began to fail him. After much persuasion and encouragement, he  finally said that if he could get half an hour's rest and sleep, he  thought he would be able to continue. We then wrapped him up in his  greatcoat, and dug out a comfortable bed in the snow, while one of us sat  down, with back against him, to keep him from rolling down the  mountain-side.      [Illustration: NEARING THE HEAD OF THE GREAT CHASM.]    We were now on the chasm's brink, looking down into its unfathomable  depths. This gigantic rent, hundreds of feet in width and thousands in  depth, indicates that northwest-southeast line along which the volcanic  forces of Ararat have acted most powerfully. This fissure is perhaps the  greatest with which the mountain is seamed, and out of which has  undoubtedly been discharged a great portion of its lava. Starting from the  base of the dome, it seemed to pierce the shifting clouds to a point about  500 feet from the summit. This line is continued out into the plain in a  series of small volcanoes the craters of which appear to be as perfect as  though they had been in activity only yesterday. The solid red and yellow  rocks which lined the sides of the great chasm projected above the  opposite brink in jagged and appalling cliffs. The whole was incased in a  mass of huge fantastic icicles, which, glittering in the sunlight, gave it  the appearance of a natural crystal palace. No more fitting place than  this could the fancy of the Kurds depict for the home of the terrible  jinn; no better symbol of nature for the awful jaws of death.    Our companion now awoke considerably refreshed, and the ascent was  continued close to the chasm's brink. Here were the only rocks to be seen  in the vast snow-bed around us. Cautiously we proceed, with cat-like  tread, following directly in one another's footsteps, and holding on to  our alpenstocks like grim death. A loosened rock would start at first  slowly, gain momentum, and fairly fly. Striking against some projecting  ledge, it would bound a hundred feet or more into the air, and then drop  out of sight among the clouds below. Every few moments we would stop to  rest; our knees were like lead, and the high altitude made breathing  difficult. Now the trail of rocks led us within two feet of the chasm's  edge; we approached it cautiously, probing well for a rock foundation, and  gazing with dizzy heads into the abyss.    The slope became steeper and steeper, until it abutted in an almost  precipitous cliff coated with snow and glistening ice. There was no escape  from it, for all around the snow-beds were too steep and slippery to  venture an ascent upon them. Cutting steps with our ice-picks, and  half-crawling, half-dragging ourselves, with the alpenstocks hooked into  the rocks above, we scaled its height, and advanced to the next abutment.  Now a cloud, as warm as exhausted steam, enveloped us in the midst of this  ice and snow. When it cleared away, the sun was reflected with intenser  brightness. Our faces were already smarting with blisters, and our dark  glasses afforded but little protection to our aching eyes.    At 11 A. M. we sat down on the snow to eat our last morsel of food. The  cold chicken and bread tasted like sawdust, for we had no saliva with  which to masticate them. Our single bottle of tea had given out, and we  suffered with thirst for several hours. Again the word to start was given.  We rose at once, but our stiffened legs quivered beneath us, and we leaned  on our alpenstocks for support. Still we plodded on for two more weary  hours, cutting our steps in the icy cliffs, or sinking to our thighs in  the treacherous snow-beds. We could see that we were nearing the top of  the great chasm, for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#11)"],[1,"tury.       It will be admitted, he thinks, by every one, that this career,       however inadequately delineated, has been one of singular       eminence and brilliancy. Entering upon public life at the close       of the first epoch in the political history of the United       States under the present Constitution, Mr. Webster has stood       below none of the distinguished men who have impressed their       character on the second.         \"There is a class of public questions in reference to which the       opinions of most men are greatly influenced by prejudices       founded in natural temperament, early associations, and real or       supposed local interest. As far as such questions are       concerned, it is too much to hope that, in times of high party       excitement, full justice will be done to prominent statesmen by       those of their contemporaries who differ from them. We greatly       err, however, if candid men of all parties, and in all parts of       the country, do not accord to Mr. Webster the praise of having       formed to himself a large and generous view of the character of       an American statesman, and of having adopted the loftiest       standard of public conduct. They will agree that he has       conceived, in all its importance, the position of the country       as a member of the great family of nations, and as the leading       republican government. In reference to domestic politics it       will be as generally conceded, that, reposing less than most       public men on a party basis, it has been the main object of his       life to confirm and perpetuate the great work of the       constitutional fathers of the last generation. By their wisdom       and patriotic forethought we are blessed with a system in which       the several states are brought into a union so admirably       composed and balanced,--both complicated and kept distinct with       such skill,--as to seem less a work of human prudence than of       Providential interposition. Mr. Webster has at all times been       fully aware of the evils of anarchy, discord, and civil war at       home, and of utter national insignificance abroad, from which       the formation of the Union saved us. He has been not less       sensible to the obstacles to be overcome, the perils to be       encountered, and the sufferings to be borne, before this       wonderful framework of government could be established. And he       has been persuaded that, if destroyed, it can never be       reconstructed. With these views, his life has been consecrated       to the maintenance in all their strength of the principles on       which the Constitution rests, and to the support of the system       created by it.         \"The key to his whole political course is the belief that, when       the Union is dissolved, the internal peace, the vigorous       growth, and the prosperity of the states, and the welfare of       their inhabitants, are blighted for ever, and that, while the       Union endures, all else of trial and calamity which can befall       a nation may be remedied or borne. So believing, he has pursued       a course which has earned for him an honored name among those       who have discharged the duty of good citizens with the most       distinguished ability, zeal, and benefit to the country. In the       relations of civilized life, there is no higher service which       man can render to man, than thus to preserve a wise       constitution of government in healthful action. Nor does the       most eloquent of the statesmen of antiquity content himself       with pronouncing this the highest human merit. In that       admirable treatise on the Republic, of which some precious       chapters have been restored to us after having been lost for       ages, he does not hesitate to affirm, that there is nothing in       which human virtue approaches nearer the divine, than in       establishing and preserving states.\"          ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.      Miss Mitford, in her pleasant _Reminiscences of a Literary Life_, gives  the following sketch of this charming poetess:         \"My first acquaintance with Elizabeth Barrett commenced about       fifteen years ago. She was certainly one of the most       interesting persons that I had ever seen. Every body who then       saw her said the same; so that it is not merely the impression       of my partiality or my enthusiasm. Of a slight, delicate       figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on either side of a       most expressive face, large, tender eyes, richly fringed by       dark eyelashes, a smile like a sunbeam, and such a look of       youthfulness that I had some difficulty in persuading a friend,       in whose carriage we went together to Chiswick, that the       translatress of the 'Prometheus' of AEschylus, the authoress of       the 'Essay on Mind,' was old enough to be introduced into       company, in technical language, 'was out.' Through the kindness       of another invaluable friend, to whom I owe many obligations,       but none so great as this, I saw much of her during my stay in       town. We met so constantly and so familiarly that, in spite of       the difference of age, intimacy ripened into friendship, and       after my return into the country, we corresponded freely and       frequently, her letters being just what letters ought to       be--her own talk put upon paper.         \"The next year was a painful one to herself and to all who       loved her. She broke a blood-vessel upon the lungs, which did       not heal. If there had been consumption in the family, that       disease would have intervened. There were no seeds of the fatal       English malady in her constitution, and she escaped. Still,       however, the vessel did not heal, and after attending her for       above a twelvemonth at her father's house in Wimpole street,       Dr. Chambers, on the approach of winter, ordered her to a       milder climate. Her eldest brother, a brother in heart and       talent worthy of such a sister, together with other devoted       relatives, accompanied her to Torquay, and there occurred the       fatal event which saddened her bloom of youth, and gave a       deeper hue of thought and feeling, especially of devotional       feeling, to her poetry. I have so often been asked what could       be the shadow that had passed over that young heart, that, now       that time has softened the first agony, it seems to me right       that the world should hear the story of an accident in which       there much sorrow, but no blame.         \"Nearly a twelvemonth had passed, and the invalid, still       attended by her affectionate companions, had derived much       benefit from the mild sea-breezes of Devonshire. One fine       summer morning, her favorite brother, together with two other       fine young men, his friends, embarked on board a small       sailing-vessel for a trip of a few hours. Excellent sailors       all, and familiar with the coast, they sent back the boatmen,       and undertook themselves the management of the little craft.       Danger was not dreamt of by any one; after the catastrophe, no       one could divine the cause, but, in a few minutes after their       embarkation, and in sight of their very windows, just as they       were crossing the bar, the boat went down, and all who were in       her perished. Even the bodies were never found. I was told by a       party who were travelling that year in Devonshire and Cornwall,       that it was most affecting to see on the corner houses of every       village street, on every church door, and almost on every cliff       for miles and miles along the coast, handbills, offering large       rewards for linen cast ashore, marked with the initials of the       beloved dead; for it so chanced that all the three were of the       dearest and the best; one, I believe, an only son, the other       the son of a widow.         \"This tragedy nearly killed Elizabeth Barrett. She was utterly       prostrated by the horror and the grief, and by a natural but a       most unjust feeling that she had been, in some sort, the cause       of this great misery. It was not until the following year that       she could be removed, in an invalid carriage, and by journeys       of twenty miles a day, to her afflicted family and her London       home. The house that she occupied at Torquay had been chosen as       one of the most sheltered in the place. It stood at the bottom       of the cliffs, almost close to the sea; and she told me herself       that during that whole winter the sound of the waves rang in       her ears like the moans of one dying. Still she clung to       literature and to Greek; in all probability she would have died       without that wholesome diversion of her thoughts. Her medical       attendant did not always understand this. To prevent the       remonstrances of her friendly physician, Dr. Barry, she caused       a small edition of Plato to be so bound as to resemble a novel.       He did not know, skilful and kind though he were, that to her,       such books were not an arduous and painful study, but a       consolation and a delight. Returned to London, she began the       life which she continued for so many years, confined to one       large and commodious but darkened chamber, admitting only her       own affectionate family and a few devoted friends (I, myself,       have often joyfully travelled five-and-forty miles to see her,       and returned the same evening without entering another house),       reading almost every book worth reading in almost every       language, and giving herself, heart and soul, to that poetry of       which she seemed born to be the priestess. Gradually her health       improved. About four years ago she married Mr. Browning, and       immediately accompanied him to Pisa. They then settled at       Florence; and this summer "]]]
