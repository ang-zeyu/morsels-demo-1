Poor new-chums! Little do they know the kind of  people they are up against.    The following description of a night at Thursday Island is taken from a  new-chum's note book:    \"Passed Proudfoot shoal and arrived at Thursday Island. First sight  of Australia. Lot of men came aboard, all called Captain. They are all  pearl-fishers or pilots, not a bit like the bushmen I expected. When  they came aboard they divided into parties. Some invaded the Captain's  cabin; others sat in the smoking room; the rest crowded into the saloon.  They talked to the passengers about the Boer War, and told us about  pearls worth 1000 pounds that had been found lately.    \"One captain pulled a handful of loose pearls out of a jar and handed  them round in a casual way for us to look at. The stewards opened  bottles and we all sat down for a drink and a smoke. I spoke to one  captain--an oldish man--and he grinned amiably, but did not answer.  Another captain leaned over to me and said, 'Don't take any notice of  him, he's boozed all this week.'    \"Conversation and drink became general. The night was very hot and  close, and some of the passengers seemed to be taking more than was good  for them. A contagious thirst spread round the ship, and before long the  stewards and firemen were at it. The saloon became an inferno of drink  and sweat and tobacco smoke. Perfect strangers were talking to each  other at the top of their voices.    \"Young MacTavish, who is in a crack English regiment, asked the captain  of a pearling lugger whether he didn't know Talbot de Cholmondeley in  the Blues.    \"The pearler said very likely he had met 'em, and no doubt he'd remember  their faces if he saw them, but he never could remember names.    \"Another passenger--a Jew--was trying to buy some pearls cheap from the  captains, but the more the captains drank the less anxious they became  to talk about pearls.    \"The night wore on, and still the drinks circulated. Young MacTavish  slept profoundly.    \"One passenger gave his steward a sovereign as he was leaving the  ship, and in half an hour the steward was carried to his berth in  a fit--alcoholic in its origin. Another steward was observed openly  drinking the passengers' whisky. When accused, he didn't even attempt  to defend himself; the great Thursday Island thirst seemed to have  communicated itself to everyone on board, and he simply _had_ to drink.    \"About three in the morning a tour of the ship disclosed the following  state of affairs: Captain's room full of captains solemnly tight;  smoking-room empty, except for the inanimate form of the captain who had  been boozed all the week, and was now sleeping peacefully with his feet  on the sofa and his head on the floor. The saloon was full of captains  and passengers--the latter mostly in a state of collapse or laughing and  singing deliriously; the rails lined with firemen who had business over  the side; stewards ditto.    \"At last the Thursday Islanders departed, unsteadily, but still on their  feet, leaving a demoralized ship behind them. And young MacTavish,  who has seen a thing or two in his brief span, staggered to his berth,  saying, 'My God! Is _all_ Australia like this place?'\"       *  *  *  *  *    When no ships arrive, the Islanders just drop into the pubs, as a  matter of routine, for their usual evening soak. They drink weird  compounds--horehound beer, known as \"lady dog\", and things like that.  About two in the morning they go home speechless, but still able to  travel. It is very rarely that an Islander gets helplessly drunk, but  strangers generally have to be put to bed.    The Japanese on the island are a strong faction. They have a club of  their own, and once gave a dinner to mark the death of one of their  members. He was shrewdly suspected of having tried to drown another  member by cutting his airpipe, so, when he died, the club celebrated  the event. The Japanese are not looked upon with favor by the white  islanders. They send their money to Japan--thousands of pounds a year go  through the little office in money-orders--and so they are not \"good for  trade\".    The Manilamen and Kanakas and Torres Strait islanders, on the other  hand, bring all the money they do not spend on the pearling schooner to  the island, and \"blow it in\", like men. They knife each other sometimes,  and now and again have to be run in wholesale, but they are \"good for  trade\". The local lock-up has a record of eighteen drunks run in in  seven minutes. They weren't taken along in carriages-and-four, either;  they were mostly dragged along by the scruff of the neck.    Billy Malkeela, the South Sea diver, summed up the Japanese  question--\"Seems to me dis Islan' soon b'long Japanee altogedder. One  time pa-lenty rickatta (plenty regatta), all same Isle of Wight. Now no  more rickatta. All money go Japan!\"    An English new-chum made his appearance there lately--a most undefeated  sportsman. He was put down in a diving dress in about eight feet of  water, where he bubbled and struggled about in great style. Suddenly he  turned, rushed for the beach, and made for the foot of a tree, which he  tried to climb under the impression that he was still at the bottom of  the ocean. Then he was hauled in by the life-line.    The pearlers thought to get some fun out of him by giving him an oyster  to open in which they had previously planted a pearl; he never saw the  pearl and threw the oyster into the scuppers with the rest, and the  pearlers had to go down on all fours and grope for that pearl among the  stinking oysters. It was funny--but not in the way they had intended.    The pearlers go out in schooners called floating stations (their enemies  call them floating public-houses) and no man knows what hospitality  is till he has been a guest on a pearling schooner. They carry it to  extremes sometimes. Some pearlers were out in a lugger, and were passing  by one of these schooners. They determined not to go on board, as it was  late, and they were in a hurry. The captain of the schooner went below,  got his rifle and put two bullets through their foresail. Then they put  the helm down and went aboard; it was an invitation almost equivalent to  a royal command. They felt heartily ashamed of themselves as they slunk  up on deck, and the captain of the schooner eyed them reproachfully.    \"I couldn't let you disgrace yourselves by passing my schooner,\" he  said; \"but if it ever happens again I'll fire at the deck. A man that  would pass a schooner in broad daylight is better dead.\"    There is a fort and garrison at Thirsty Island, but they are not needed.  If an invading fleet comes this way it should be encouraged by every  possible means to land at the island; the heat, the thirst, the  horehound beer, and the Islanders may be trusted to do the rest.          DAN FITZGERALD EXPLAINS      The circus was having its afternoon siesta. Overhead the towering canvas  tent spread like a giant mushroom on a network of stalks--slanting  beams, interlaced with guys and wire ropes.    The ring looked small and lonely; its circle of empty benches seemed  to stare intently at it, as though some sort of unseen performance were  going on for the benefit of a ghostly audience. Now and again a guy rope  creaked, or a loose end of canvas flapped like faint, unreal applause,  as the silence shut down again, it did not need much imagination to  people the ring with dead and gone circus riders performing for the  benefit of shadowy spectators packed on those benches.    In the menagerie portion matters were different; here there was a free  and easy air, the animals realising that for the present the eyes of the  public were off them, and they could put in the afternoon as they chose.    The big African apes had dropped the \"business\" of showing their teeth,  and pretending that they wanted to tear the spectators' faces off. They  were carefully and painstakingly trying to fix up a kind of rustic seat  in the corner of their cage with a short piece of board, which they  placed against the wall. This fell down every time they sat on it, and  the whole adjustment had to be gone through again.    The camel had stretched himself full length on the tan, and was enjoying  a luxurious snooze, oblivious of the fact that before long he would  have to get up and assume that far-off ship-of-the-desert aspect. The  remainder of the animals were, like actors, \"resting\" before their  \"turn\" came on; even the elephant had ceased to sway about, while a  small monkey, asleep on a sloping tent pole, had an attack of nightmare  and would have fallen off his perch but for his big tail. It was a land  of the Lotus-eater        \"In which it seemed always afternoon.\"    These visions were dispelled by the entry of a person who said, \"D'ye  want to see Dan?\" and soon Dan Fitzgerald, the man who knows all  about the training of horses, came into the tent with Montgomery, the  ringmaster, and between them they proceeded to expound the methods of  training horseflesh.    \"What sort of horse do we buy for circus work? Well, it depends what we  want 'em for. There are three sorts of horses in use in a circus--ring  horses, trick horses, and school horses; but it doesn't matter what he  is wanted for, a horse is all the better if he knows nothing. A horse  that has been pulled about and partly trained has to unlearn a lot  before he is any use to us. The less he knows, the better it is.\"    \"Then do you just try any sort of horse?\"    \"Any sort, so long as he is a good sort, but it depends on what he is  wanted for. If we want a ring horse, he has to be a quiet sober-going  animal, not too well-bred and fiery. A ring horse is one that just goes  round the ring for the bareback riders"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#11)"],[1,"the Bible beforehand; on the other hand, the text of the Old and  New Testaments might be written on its walls, and yet the building be a  very inconvenient kind of book, not so useful as if it had been adorned  with intelligible and vivid sculpture. So, again, the power of exciting  emotion must vary or vanish, as the spectator becomes thoughtless or  cold; and the building may be often blamed for what is the fault of its  critic, or endowed with a charm which is of its spectator's creation. It  is not, therefore, possible to make expressional character any fair  criterion of excellence in buildings, until we can fully place ourselves  in the position of those to whom their expression was originally  addressed, and until we are certain that we understand every symbol, and  are capable of being touched by every association which its builders  employed as letters of their language. I shall continually endeavor to  put the reader into such sympathetic temper, when I ask for his judgment  of a building; and in every work I may bring before him I shall point  out, as far as I am able, whatever is peculiar in its expression; nay, I  must even depend on such peculiarities for much of my best evidence  respecting the character of the builders. But I cannot legalize the  judgment for which I plead, nor insist upon it if it be refused. I can  neither force the reader to feel this architectural rhetoric, nor compel  him to confess that the rhetoric is powerful, if it have produced no  impression on his own mind.    Sec. III. I leave, therefore, the expression of buildings for incidental  notice only. But their other two virtues are proper subjects of  law,--their performance of their common and necessary work, and their  conformity with universal and divine canons of loveliness: respecting  these there can be no doubt, no ambiguity. I would have the reader  discern them so quickly that, as he passes along a street, he may, by a  glance of the eye, distinguish the noble from the ignoble work. He can  do this, if he permit free play to his natural instincts; and all that I  have to do for him is to remove from those instincts the artificial  restraints which prevent their action, and to encourage them to an  unaffected and unbiassed choice between right and wrong.    Sec. IV. We have, then, two qualities of buildings for subjects of  separate inquiry: their action, and aspect, and the sources of virtue  in both; that is to say, Strength and Beauty, both of these being  less admired in themselves, than as testifying the intelligence or  imagination of the builder.    For we have a worthier way of looking at human than at divine  architecture: much of the value both of construction and decoration, in  the edifices of men, depends upon our being led by the thing produced or  adorned, to some contemplation of the powers of mind concerned in its  creation or adornment. We are not so led by divine work, but are content  to rest in the contemplation of the thing created. I wish the reader to  note this especially: we take pleasure, or _should_ take pleasure, in  architectural construction altogether as the manifestation of an  admirable human intelligence; it is not the strength, not the size, not  the finish of the work which we are to venerate: rocks are always  stronger, mountains always larger, all natural objects more finished;  but it is the intelligence and resolution of man in overcoming physical  difficulty which are to be the source of our pleasure and subject of our  praise. And again, in decoration or beauty, it is less the actual  loveliness of the thing produced, than the choice and invention  concerned in the production, which are to delight us; the love and the  thoughts of the workman more than his work: his work must always be  imperfect, but his thoughts and affections may be true and deep.    Sec. V. This origin of our pleasure in architecture I must insist upon  at somewhat greater length, for I would fain do away with some of the  ungrateful coldness which we show towards the good builders of old time.  In no art is there closer connection between our delight in the work,  and our admiration of the workman's mind, than in architecture, and yet  we rarely ask for a builder's name. The patron at whose cost, the monk  through whose dreaming, the foundation was laid, we remember  occasionally; never the man who verily did the work. Did the reader ever  hear of William of Sens as having had anything to do with Canterbury  Cathedral? or of Pietro Basegio as in anywise connected with the Ducal  Palace of Venice? There is much ingratitude and injustice in this; and  therefore I desire my reader to observe carefully how much of his  pleasure in building is derived, or should be derived, from admiration  of the intellect of men whose names he knows not.    Sec. VI. The two virtues of architecture which we can justly weigh, are,  we said, its strength or good construction, and its beauty or good  decoration. Consider first, therefore, what you mean when you say a  building is well constructed or well built; you do not merely mean that  it answers its purpose,--this is much, and many modern buildings fail of  this much; but if it be verily well built, it must answer this purpose  in the simplest way, and with no over-expenditure of means. We require  of a light-house, for instance, that it shall stand firm and carry a  light; if it do not this, assuredly it has been ill built; but it may do  it to the end of time, and yet not be well built. It may have hundreds  of tons of stone in it more than were needed, and have cost thousands  of pounds more than it ought. To pronounce it well or ill built, we must  know the utmost forces it can have to resist, and the best arrangements  of stone for encountering them, and the quickest ways of effecting such  arrangements: then only, so far as such arrangements have been chosen,  and such methods used, is it well built. Then the knowledge of all  difficulties to be met, and of all means of meeting them, and the quick  and true fancy or invention of the modes of applying the means to the  end, are what we have to admire in the builder, even as he is seen  through this first or inferior part of his work. Mental power, observe:  not muscular nor mechanical, nor technical, nor empirical,--pure,  precious, majestic, massy intellect; not to be had at vulgar price, nor  received without thanks, and without asking from whom.    Sec. VII. Suppose, for instance, we are present at the building of a  bridge: the bricklayers or masons have had their centring erected for  them, and that centring was put together by a carpenter, who had the  line of its curve traced for him by the architect: the masons are  dexterously handling and fitting their bricks, or, by the help of  machinery, carefully adjusting stones which are numbered for their  places. There is probably in their quickness of eye and readiness of  hand something admirable; but this is not what I ask the reader to  admire: not the carpentering, nor the bricklaying, nor anything that he  can presently see and understand, but the choice of the curve, and the  shaping of the numbered stones, and the appointment of that number;  there were many things to be known and thought upon before these were  decided. The man who chose the curve and numbered the stones, had to  know the times and tides of the river, and the strength of its floods,  and the height and flow of them, and the soil of the banks, and the  endurance of it, and the weight of the stones he had to build with, and  the kind of traffic that day by day would be carried on over his  bridge,--all this specially, and all the great general laws of force and  weight, and their working; and in the choice of the curve and numbering  of stones are expressed not only his knowledge of these, but such  ingenuity and firmness as he had, in applying special means to overcome  the special difficulties about his bridge. There is no saying how much  wit, how much depth of thought, how much fancy, presence of mind,  courage, and fixed resolution there may have gone to the placing of a  single stone of it. This is what we have to admire,--this grand power  and heart of man in the thing; not his technical or empirical way of  holding the trowel and laying mortar.    Sec. VIII. Now there is in everything properly called art this concernment  of the intellect, even in the province of the art which seems merely  practical. For observe: in this bridge-building I suppose no reference  to architectural principles; all that I suppose we want is to get safely  over the river; the man who has taken us over is still a mere  bridge-builder,--a _builder_, not an architect: he may be a rough,  artless, feelingless man, incapable of doing any one truly fine thing  all his days. I shall call upon you to despise him presently in a sort,  but not as if he were a mere smoother of mortar; perhaps a great man,  infinite in memory, indefatigable in labor, exhaustless in expedient,  unsurpassable in quickness of thought. Take good heed you understand him  before you despise him.    Sec. IX. But why is he to be in anywise despised? By no means despise him,  unless he happen to be without a soul,[29] or at least to show no signs  of it; which possibly he may not in merely carrying you across the  river. He may be merely what Mr. Carlyle rightly calls a human beaver  after all; and there may be nothing in all that ingenuity of his greater  than a complication of animal faculties, an intricate bestiality,--nest  or hive building in its highest development. You need something more  than this, or the man is despicable; you need that virtue of building  through which he may show his affections and delights; you need its  beauty or decoration.    Sec. X. Not that, in reality, one division of the man is more human than  another. Theologists fall into this error very fatally and continually;  and a man from whom I have"]]]
