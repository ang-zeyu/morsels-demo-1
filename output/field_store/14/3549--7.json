This bill passed the two Houses  with little or no opposition. [49] But the malecontents out of doors did  not fail to remark that, in the late reign, the Habeas Corpus Act had  not been one day suspended. It was the fashion to call James a tyrant,  and William a deliverer. Yet, before the deliverer had been a month on  the throne, he had deprived Englishmen of a precious right which the  tyrant had respected. [50] This is a kind of reproach which a government  sprung from a popular revolution almost inevitably incurs. From such  a government men naturally think themselves entitled to demand a more  gentle and liberal administration than is expected from old and deeply  rooted power. Yet such a government, having, as it always has, many  active enemies, and not having the strength derived from legitimacy and  prescription, can at first maintain itself only by a vigilance and  a severity of which old and deeply rooted power stands in no need.  Extraordinary and irregular vindications of public liberty are sometimes  necessary: yet, however necessary, they are almost always followed  by some temporary abridgments of that very liberty; and every such  abridgment is a fertile and plausible theme for sarcasm and invective.    Unhappily sarcasm and invective directed against William were but too  likely to find favourable audience. Each of the two great parties had  its own reasons for being dissatisfied with him; and there were some  complaints in which both parties joined. His manners gave almost  universal offence. He was in truth far better qualified to save a nation  than to adorn a court. In the highest parts of statesmanship, he had  no equal among his contemporaries. He had formed plans not inferior in  grandeur and boldness to those of Richelieu, and had carried them into  effect with a tact and wariness worthy of Mazarin. Two countries, the  seats of civil liberty and of the Reformed Faith, had been preserved  by his wisdom and courage from extreme perils. Holland he had delivered  from foreign, and England from domestic foes. Obstacles apparently  insurmountable had been interposed between him and the ends on which  he was intent; and those obstacles his genius had turned into stepping  stones. Under his dexterous management the hereditary enemies of his  house had helped him to mount a throne; and the persecutors of his  religion had helped him to rescue his religion from persecution.  Fleets and armies, collected to withstand him, had, without a struggle,  submitted to his orders. Factions and sects, divided by mortal  antipathies, had recognised him as their common head. Without carnage,  without devastation, he had won a victory compared with which all the  victories of Gustavus and Turenne were insignificant. In a few weeks he  had changed the relative position of all the states in Europe, and  had restored the equilibrium which the preponderance of one power had  destroyed. Foreign nations did ample justice to his great qualities. In  every Continental country where Protestant congregations met, fervent  thanks were offered to God, who, from among the progeny of His servants,  Maurice, the deliverer of Germany, and William, the deliverer of  Holland, had raised up a third deliverer, the wisest and mightiest  of all. At Vienna, at Madrid, nay, at Rome, the valiant and sagacious  heretic was held in honour as the chief of the great confederacy  against the House of Bourbon; and even at Versailles the hatred which he  inspired was largely mingled with admiration.    Here he was less favourably judged. In truth, our ancestors saw him in  the worst of all lights. By the French, the Germans, and the Italians,  he was contemplated at such a distance that only what was great could be  discerned, and that small blemishes were invisible. To the Dutch he was  brought close: but he was himself a Dutchman. In his intercourse with  them he was seen to the best advantage, he was perfectly at his ease  with them; and from among them he had chosen his earliest and dearest  friends. But to the English he appeared in a most unfortunate point of  view. He was at once too near to them and too far from them. He lived  among them, so that the smallest peculiarity of temper or manner could  not escape their notice. Yet he lived apart from them, and was to the  last a foreigner in speech, tastes, and habits.    One of the chief functions of our Sovereigns had long been to preside  over the society of the capital. That function Charles the Second had  performed with immense success. His easy bow, his good stories, his  style of dancing and playing tennis, the sound of his cordial laugh,  were familiar to all London. One day he was seen among the elms of Saint  James's Park chatting with Dryden about poetry. [51] Another day his arm  was on Tom Durfey's shoulder; and his Majesty was taking a second, while  his companion sang \"Phillida, Phillida,\" or \"To horse, brave boys,  to Newmarket, to horse.\" [52] James, with much less vivacity and good  nature, was accessible, and, to people who did not cross him, civil.  But of this sociableness William was entirely destitute. He seldom came  forth from his closet; and, when he appeared in the public rooms, he  stood among the crowd of courtiers and ladies, stern and abstracted,  making no jest and smiling at none. His freezing look, his silence, the  dry and concise answers which he uttered when he could keep silence no  longer, disgusted noblemen and gentlemen who had been accustomed to  be slapped on the back by their royal masters, called Jack or Harry,  congratulated about race cups or rallied about actresses. The women  missed the homage due to their sex. They observed that the King spoke in  a somewhat imperious tone even to the wife to whom he owed so much, and  whom he sincerely loved and esteemed. [53] They were amused and shocked  to see him, when the Princess Anne dined with him, and when the first  green peas of the year were put on the table, devour the whole dish  without offering a spoonful to her Royal Highness; and they pronounced  that this great soldier and politician was no better than a Low Dutch  bear. [54]    One misfortune, which was imputed to him as a crime, was his bad  English. He spoke our language, but not well. His accent was foreign:  his diction was inelegant; and his vocabulary seems to have been no  larger than was necessary for the transaction of business. To the  difficulty which he felt in expressing himself, and to his consciousness  that his pronunciation was bad, must be partly ascribed the taciturnity  and the short answers which gave so much offence. Our literature he was  incapable of enjoying or of understanding. He never once, during his  whole reign, showed himself at the theatre. [55] The poets who wrote  Pindaric verses in his praise complained that their flights of sublimity  were beyond his comprehension. [56] Those who are acquainted with the  panegyrical odes of that age will perhaps be of opinion that he did not  lose much by his ignorance.    It is true that his wife did her best to supply what was wanting, and  that she was excellently qualified to be the head of the Court. She was  English by birth, and English also in her tastes and feelings. Her  face was handsome, her port majestic, her temper sweet and lively, her  manners affable and graceful. Her understanding, though very imperfectly  cultivated, was quick. There was no want of feminine wit and shrewdness  in her conversation; and her letters were so well expressed that they  deserved to be well spelt. She took much pleasure in the lighter kinds  of literature, and did something towards bringing books into fashion  among ladies of quality. The stainless purity of her private life and  the strict attention which she paid to her religious duties were the  more respectable, because she was singularly free from censoriousness,  and discouraged scandal as much as vice. In dislike of backbiting indeed  she and her husband cordially agreed; but they showed their dislike in  different and in very characteristic ways. William preserved profound  silence, and gave the talebearer a look which, as was said by a person  who had once encountered it, and who took good care never to encounter  it again, made your story go back down your throat. [57] Mary had a way  of interrupting tattle about elopements, duels, and playdebts by asking  the tattlers, very quietly yet significantly, whether they had ever read  her favourite sermon, Doctor Tillotson's on Evil Speaking. Her charities  were munificent and judicious; and, though she made no ostentatious  display of them, it was known that she retrenched from her own state in  order to relieve Protestants whom persecution had driven from France and  Ireland, and who were starving in the garrets of London. So amiable was  her conduct, that she was generally spoken of with esteem and tenderness  by the most respectable of those who disapproved of the manner in which  she had been raised to the throne, and even of those who refused  to acknowledge her as Queen. In the Jacobite lampoons of that time,  lampoons which, in virulence and malignity, far exceed any thing that  our age has produced, she was not often mentioned with severity. Indeed  she sometimes expressed her surprise at finding that libellers who  respected nothing else respected her name. God, she said, knew where  her weakness lay. She was too sensitive to abuse and calumny; He had  mercifully spared her a trial which was beyond her strength; and the  best return which she could make to Him was to discountenance all  malicious reflections on the characters of others. Assured that she  possessed her husband's entire confidence and affection, she turned the  edge of his sharp speeches sometimes by soft and sometimes by playful  answers, and employed all the influence which she derived from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II â€” Volume 4 (#11)"],[1,", but is not yet entirely unveiled. Some parts which  are still obscure may possibly, by the discovery of letters or diaries  now reposing under the dust of a century and a half, be made clear to  our posterity. The materials, however, which are at present accessible,  are sufficient for the construction of a narrative not to be read  without shame and loathing. [62]    We have seen that, in the spring of 1690, Shrewsbury, irritated by  finding his counsels rejected, and those of his Tory rivals followed,  suffered himself, in a fatal hour, to be drawn into a correspondence  with the banished family. We have seen also by what cruel sufferings of  body and mind he expiated his fault. Tortured by remorse, and by disease  the effect of remorse, he had quitted the Court; but he had left behind  him men whose principles were not less lax than his, and whose hearts  were far harder and colder.    Early in 1691, some of these men began to hold secret communication with  Saint Germains. Wicked and base as their conduct was, there was in it  nothing surprising. They did after their kind. The times were troubled.  A thick cloud was upon the future. The most sagacious and experienced  politician could not see with any clearness three months before him.  To a man of virtue and honour, indeed, this mattered little. His  uncertainty as to what the morrow might bring forth might make him  anxious, but could not make him perfidious. Though left in utter  darkness as to what concerned his interests, he had the sure guidance  of his principles. But, unhappily, men of virtue and honour were not  numerous among the courtiers of that age. Whitehall had been, during  thirty years, a seminary of every public and private vice, and  swarmed with lowminded, doubledealing, selfseeking politicians. These  politicians now acted as it was natural that men profoundly immoral  should act at a crisis of which none could predict the issue. Some  of them might have a slight predilection for William; others a slight  predilection for James; but it was not by any such predilection that the  conduct of any of the breed was guided. If it had seemed certain that  William would stand, they would all have been for William. If it had  seemed certain that James would be restored, they would all have been  for James. But what was to be done when the chances appeared to be  almost exactly balanced? There were honest men of one party who would  have answered, To stand by the true King and the true Church, and, if  necessary, to die for them like Laud. There were honest men of the other  party who would have answered, To stand by the liberties of England and  the Protestant religion, and, if necessary, to die for them like Sidney.  But such consistency was unintelligible to many of the noble and the  powerful. Their object was to be safe in every event. They therefore  openly took the oath of allegiance to one King, and secretly plighted  their word to the other. They were indefatigable in obtaining  commissions, patents of peerage, pensions, grants of crown land, under  the great seal of William; and they had in their secret drawers promises  of pardon in the handwriting of James.    Among those who were guilty of this wickedness three men stand  preeminent, Russell, Godolphin and Marlborough. No three men could  be, in head and heart, more unlike to one another; and the peculiar  qualities of each gave a peculiar character to his villany. The treason  of Russell is to be attributed partly to fractiousness; the treason of  Godolphin is to be attributed altogether to timidity; the treason of  Marlborough was the treason of a man of great genius and boundless  ambition.    It may be thought strange that Russell should have been out of humour.  He had just accepted the command of the united naval forces of England  and Holland with the rank of Admiral of the Fleet. He was Treasurer  of the Navy. He had a pension of three thousand pounds a year. Crown  property near Charing Cross, to the value of eighteen thousand pounds,  had been bestowed on him. His indirect gains must have been immense.  But he was still dissatisfed. In truth, with undaunted courage, with  considerable talents both for war and for administration, and with a  certain public spirit, which showed itself by glimpses even in the  very worst parts of his life, he was emphatically a bad man, insolent,  malignant, greedy, faithless. He conceived that the great services which  he had performed at the time of the Revolution had not been adequately  rewarded. Every thing that was given to others seemed to him to be  pillaged from himself. A letter is still extant which he wrote to  William about this time. It is made up of boasts, reproaches and sneers.  The Admiral, with ironical professions of humility and loyalty, begins  by asking permission to put his wrongs on paper, because his bashfulness  would not suffer him to explain himself by word of mouth. His grievances  were intolerable. Other people got grants of royal domains; but he could  get scarcely any thing. Other people could provide for their dependants;  but his recommendations were uniformly disregarded. The income which  he derived from the royal favour might seem large; but he had poor  relations; and the government, instead of doing its duty by them, had  most unhandsomely left them to his care. He had a sister who ought to  have a pension; for, without one, she could not give portions to her  daughters. He had a brother who, for want of a place, had been reduced  to the melancholy necessity of marrying an old woman for her money.  Russell proceeded to complain bitterly that the Whigs were neglected,  that the Revolution had aggrandised and enriched men who had made the  greatest efforts to avert it. And there is reason to believe that this  complaint came from his heart. For, next to his own interests, those  of his party were dear to him; and, even when he was most inclined to  become a Jacobite, he never had the smallest disposition to become a  Tory. In the temper which this letter indicates, he readily listened  to the suggestions of David Lloyd, one of the ablest and most active  emissaries who at this time were constantly plying between France and  England. Lloyd conveyed to James assurances that Russell would, when a  favourable opportunity should present itself, try to effect by means of  the fleet what Monk had effected in the preceding generation by means  of the army. [63] To what extent these assurances were sincere was a  question about which men who knew Russell well, and who were minutely  informed as to his conduct, were in doubt. It seems probable that,  during many months, he did not know his own mind. His interest was to  stand well, as long as possible, with both Kings. His irritable and  imperious nature was constantly impelling him to quarrel with both. His  spleen was excited one week by a dry answer from William, and the  next week by an absurd proclamation from James. Fortunately the most  important day of his life, the day from which all his subsequent years  took their colour, found him out of temper with the banished King.    Godolphin had not, and did not pretend to have, any cause of complaint  against the government which he served. He was First Commissioner of the  Treasury. He had been protected, trusted, caressed. Indeed the favour  shown to him had excited many murmurs. Was it fitting, the Whigs had  indignantly asked, that a man who had been high in office through the  whole of the late reign, who had promised to vote for the Indulgence,  who had sate in the Privy Council with a Jesuit, who had sate at the  Board of Treasury with two Papists, who had attended an idolatress to  her altar, should be among the chief ministers of a Prince whose title  to the throne was derived from the Declaration of Rights? But on William  this clamour had produced no effect; and none of his English servants  seems to have had at this time a larger share of his confidence than  Godolphin.    Nevertheless, the Jacobites did not despair. One of the most zealous  among them, a gentleman named Bulkeley, who had formerly been on terms  of intimacy with Godolphin, undertook to see what could be done. He  called at the Treasury, and tried to draw the First Lord into political  talk. This was no easy matter; for Godolphin was not a man to put  himself lightly into the power of others. His reserve was proverbial;  and he was especially renowned for the dexterity with which he, through  life, turned conversation away from matters of state to a main of cocks  or the pedigree of a racehorse. The visit ended without his uttering a  word indicating that he remembered the existence of King James.    Bulkeley, however, was not to be so repulsed. He came again, and  introduced the subject which was nearest his heart. Godolphin then asked  after his old master and mistress in the mournful tone of a man who  despaired of ever being reconciled to them. Bulkeley assured him that  King James was ready to forgive all the past. \"May I tell His Majesty  that you will try to deserve his favour?\" At this Godolphin rose, said  something about the trammels of office and his wish to be released from  them, and put an end to the interview.    Bulkeley soon made a third attempt. By this time Godolphin had  learned some things which shook his confidence in the stability of the  government which he served. He began to think, as he would himself have  expressed it, that he had betted too deep on the Revolution, and that  it was time to hedge. Evasions would no longer serve his turn. It was  necessary to speak out. He spoke out, and declared himself a devoted  servant of King James. \"I shall take an early opportunity of resigning  my place. But, till then, I am under a tie. I must not betray my trust.\"  To enhance the value of the sacrifice which he proposed to make, he  produced a most friendly and confidential letter which he had lately  received"]]]
