As to him who is wealthy-    To him thou wast all attention:    Yet is it not thy concern if he be not cleansed:2    But as to him who cometh to thee in earnest,    And full of fears-    Him dost thou neglect.    Nay! but it (the Koran) is a warning;    (And whoso is willing beareth it in mind)    Written on honoured pages,    Exalted, purified,    By the hands of Scribes, honoured, righteous.    Cursed be man! What hath made him unbelieving?    Of what thing did God create him?    Out of moist germs.3    He created him and fashioned him,    Then made him an easy passage from the womb,    Then causeth him to die and burieth him;    Then, when he pleaseth, will raise him again to life.    Aye! but man hath not yet fulfilled the bidding of his Lord.    Let man look at his food:    It was We who rained down the copious rains,    Then cleft the earth with clefts,    And caused the upgrowth of the grain,    And grapes and healing herbs,    And the olive and the palm,    And enclosed gardens thick with trees,    And fruits and herbage,    For the service of yourselves and of your cattle.    But when the stunning trumpet-blast shall arrive,4    On that day shall a man fly from his brother,    And his mother and his father,    And his wife and his children;    For every man of them on that day his own concerns shall be enough.    There shall be faces on that day radiant,    Laughing and joyous:    And faces on that day with dust upon them:    Blackness shall cover them!    These are the Infidels, the Impure.      _______________________    1 We are told in the traditions, etc., that when engaged in converse with  Walid, a chief man among the Koreisch, Muhammad was interrupted by the blind  Abdallah Ibn Omm Maktûm, who asked to hear the Koran. The Prophet spoke very  roughly to him at the time, but afterwards repented, and treated him ever  after with the greatest respect. So much so, that he twice made him Governor  of Medina.    2 That is, if he does not embrace Islam, and so become pure from sin, thou  wilt not be to blame; thou art simply charged with the delivery of a message  of warning.    3 Ex spermate.    4 Descriptions of the Day of Judgment now become very frequent.

We will teach thee to recite the Koran, nor aught shalt thou forget,    Save what God pleaseth; for he knoweth alike things manifest and hidden;    And we will make easy to thee our easy ways.    Warn, therefore, for the warning is profitable:    He that feareth God will receive the warning,-    And the most reprobate only will turn aside from it,    Who shall be exposed to the terrible fire,    In which he shall not die, and shall not live.    Happy he who is purified by Islam,    And who remembereth the name of his Lord and prayeth.    But ye prefer this present life,    Though the life to come is better and more enduring.

This valley in  about the fourth century of our ra was a kind of sacred forest of 37 miles  in circumference, and called Haram a name applied to it as early as the time  of Pliny (vi. 32). It had the privilege of asylum, but it was not lawful to  inhabit it, or to carry on commerce within its limits, and its religious  ceremonies were a bond of union to several of the Bedouin tribes of the  Hejaz. The Koreisch had monopolised most of the offices and advantages of the  Haram in the time of Muhammad. See Sprenger's Life of Mohammad, pp. 7 20.

But for those who shall have believed and done the things that be right, are  the Gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow. This the immense bliss!    Verily, right terrible will be thy Lord's vengeance!

Along the edge of the rocks on the summit of Mount  Willard a great profusion of the common saxifrage was waving in the  fresh breeze:        \"Ten thousand saw I at a glance,      Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\"    On the lower parts of the mountains, the foliage was already well out,  while the upper parts were of a fine purplish tint, which at first I was  unable to account for, but which I soon discovered to be due to the fact  that the trees at that height were still only in bud.    A notable feature of the White Mountain forests is the absence of oaks  and hickories. These tough, hard woods would seem to have been created  on purpose to stand against wind and cold. But no; the hills are covered  with the fragile poplars and birches and spruces, with never an oak or  hickory among them. I suspect, indeed, that it is the very softness of  the former which gives them their advantage. For this, as I suppose, is  correlated with rapid growth; and where the summer is very short, speed  may count for more than firmness of texture, especially during the first  one or two years of the plant's life. Trees, like men, lose in one way  what they gain in another; or, in other words, they \"have the defects  of their qualities.\" Probably Paul's confession, \"When I am weak, then  am I strong,\" is after all only the personal statement of a general law,  as true of a poplar as of a Christian. For we all believe (do we not?)  that the world is a universe, governed throughout by one Mind, so that  whatever holds in one part is good everywhere.    But it was June, and the birds, who were singing from daylight till  dark, would have the most of my attention. It was pleasant to find here  two comparatively rare warblers, of whom I had before had only casual  glimpses,--the mourning warbler and the bay-breasted. The former was  singing his loud but commonplace ditty within a few rods of the piazza  on one side of the house, while his congener, the Maryland  yellow-throat, was to be heard on the other side, along with the  black-cap (_Dendroeca striata_), the black-and-yellow, and the  Canadian flycatcher. The mourning warbler's song, as I heard it, was  like this: _Whit whit whit_, _wit wit_. The first three notes were  deliberate and loud, on one key, and without accent. The last two were  pitched a little lower, and were shorter, with the accent on the first  of the pair; they were thinner in tone than the opening triplet, as is  meant to be indicated by the difference of spelling.[8] Others of the  family were the golden-crowned thrush, the small-billed water-thrush,  the yellow-rumped, the Blackburnian (with his characteristic _zillup_,  _zillup_, _zillup_), the black-throated green, the black-throated blue  (the last with his loud, coarse _kree_, _kree_, _kree_), the redstart,  and the elegant blue yellow-back. Altogether, they were a gorgeous  company.    But the chief singers were the olive-backed thrushes and the winter  wrens. I should be glad to know on just what principle the olive-backs  and their near relatives, the hermits, distribute themselves throughout  the mountain region. Each species seems to have its own sections, to  which it returns year after year, and the olive-backed, being, as is  well known, the more northern species of the two, naturally prefers the  more elevated situations. I have found the latter abundant near the  Profile House, and for three seasons it has had exclusive possession of  the White Mountain Notch,--so far, at least, as I have been able to  discover.[9] The hermits, on the other hand, frequent such places as  North Conway, Gorham, Jefferson, Bethlehem, and the vicinity of the  Flume. Only once have I found the two species in the same neighborhood.  That was near the Breezy Point House, on the side of Mount Moosilauke;  but this place is so peculiarly romantic, with its noble amphitheatre of  hills, that I could not wonder neither species was willing to yield the  ground entirely to the other; and even here it was to be noticed that  the hermits were in or near the sugar-grove, while the Swainsons were in  the forest, far off in an opposite direction.[10]    It is these birds, if any, whose music reaches the ears of the ordinary  mountain tourist. Every man who is known among his acquaintances to have  a little knowledge of such things is approached now and then with the  question, \"What bird was it, Mr. So-and-So, that I heard singing up in  the mountains? I didn't see him; he was always ever so far off; but his  voice was wonderful, so sweet and clear and loud!\" As a rule it may  safely be taken for granted that such interrogatories refer either to  the Swainson thrush or to the hermit. The inquirer is very likely  disposed to be incredulous when he is told that there are birds in his  own woods whose voice is so like that of his admired New Hampshire  songster that, if he were to hear the two together, he would not at  first be able to tell the one from the other. He has never heard them,  he protests; which is true enough, for he never goes into the woods of  his own town, or, if by chance he does, he leaves his ears behind him in  the shop. His case is not peculiar. Men and women gaze enraptured at New  Hampshire sunsets. How glorious they are, to be sure! What a pity the  sun does not sometimes set in Massachusetts!    As a musician the olive-back is certainly inferior to the hermit, and,  according to my taste, he is surpassed also by the wood thrush and the  Wilson; but he is a magnificent singer, for all that, and when he is  heard in the absence of the others it is often hard to believe that any  one of them could do better. A good idea of the rhythm and length of his  song may be gained by pronouncing somewhat rapidly the words, \"I love, I  love, I love you,\" or, as it sometimes runs, \"I love, I love, I love you  truly.\" How literal this translation is I am not scholar enough to  determine, but without question it gives the sense substantially.    The winter wrens were less numerous than the thrushes, I think, but,  like them, they sang at all hours of the day, and seemed to be well  distributed throughout the woods. We can hardly help asking how it is  that two birds so very closely related as the house wren and the winter  wren should have been chosen haunts so extremely diverse,--the one  preferring door-yards in thickly settled villages, the other keeping  strictly to the wildest of all wild places. But whatever the  explanation, we need not wish the fact itself different. Comparatively  few ever hear the winter wren's song, to be sure (for you will hardly  get it from a hotel piazza), but it is not the less enjoyed on that  account. There is such a thing as a bird's making himself too common;  and probably it is true even of the great _prima donna_ that it is not  those who live in the house with her who find most pleasure in her  music. Moreover, there is much in time and circumstance. You hear a song  in the village street, and pass along unmoved; but stand in the silence  of the forest, with your feet in a bed of creeping snowberry and oxalis,  and the same song goes to your very soul.    The great distinction of the winter wren's melody is its marked rhythm  and accent, which give it a martial, fife-like character. Note tumbles  over note in the true wren manner, and the strain comes to an end so  suddenly that for the first few times you are likely to think that the  bird has been interrupted. In the middle is a long in-drawn note, much  like one of the canary's. The odd little creature does not get far away  from the ground. I have never seen him sing from a living tree or bush,  but always from a stump or a log, or from the root or branch of an  overturned tree,--from something, at least, of nearly his own color.[11]  The song is intrinsically one of the most beautiful, and in my ears it  has the further merit of being forever associated with reminiscences of  ramblings among the White Hills. How well I remember an early morning  hour at Profile Lake, when it came again and again across the water from  the woods on Mount Cannon, under the Great Stone Face!    Whichever way I walked, I was sure of the society of the snow-birds.  They hopped familiarly across the railroad track in front of the  Crawford House, and on the summit of Mount Washington were scurrying  about among the rocks, opening and shutting their pretty white-bordered  fans. Half-way up Mount Willard I sat down to rest on a stone, and after  a minute or two out dropped a snow-bird at my feet, and ran across the  road, trailing her wings. I looked under the bank for her nest, but, to  my surprise, could find nothing of it. So I made sure of knowing the  place again, and continued my tramp. Returning two hours later, I sat  down upon the same bowlder, and watched for the bird to appear as  before; but she had gathered courage from my former failure,--or so it  seemed,--and I waited in vain till I rapped upon the ground over her  head. Then she scrambled out and limped away, repeating her innocent but  hackneyed ruse. This time I was resolved not to be baffled. The nest was  there, and I would find it. So down on my knees I got, and scrutinized  the whole place most carefully. But though I had marked the precise  spot, there was no sign of a nest. I was about giving over the search  ignominiously, when I descried a slight opening between the overhanging  roof of the bank and a layer of earth which some roots held in place  close under it. Into this slit I inserted my fingers, and there,  entirely out of sight, was the nest full of eggs. No man could ever have  found it, had the bird been brave and wise enough to keep her seat.  However, I had before this noticed that the snow-bird, while often  extremely clever in choosing a building site, is seldom very skillful in  keeping a secret. I saw him one day standing on the side of the same  Mount"]]]
