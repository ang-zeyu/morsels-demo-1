The 8-1/2d. could not work miracles, and try as  they would--and did--those responsible for the welfare of the men found  themselves hard pressed in ensuring that their charges were even  decently fed. Nor was the procuring of suitable and adequate rations the  only trouble. Cooking them also presented many difficulties. Travelling  kitchens had not then been supplied to the new units, and the only  cooking vessels available were the camp kettles or dixies. Consequently  such food as had to be cooked could only be boiled or stewed, and even  then the results were not always satisfactory. The cooks themselves were  untrained and often had to be changed. They lacked the knowledge and  experience necessary to secure the best results and avoid waste. They  were also handicapped for want of proper fuel and plant. The fuel was  wood. What kind of wood it was, or where it came from, nobody knew. It  had the appearance and endurance of that stray log which sometimes  arrives in loads from Australian woodyards and which the self-respecting  householder absolutely declines to tackle except in the last extremity.  It played havoc with the temper of the cooks' fatigues and also with  their tools.    Clothing was an important factor. The heavy woollen material of the  Australian uniforms was unsuitable in a climate where rain was almost  unknown and where the daily temperature averaged over 90 deg. in the  shade during the whole time of the Battalion's stay. Furthermore, a  number of hats had been lost overboard during the voyage from Fremantle.  There were no present means of replacing these; meanwhile, men were in  daily danger of heat stroke. It was decided, therefore, to clothe all  the troops in khaki cotton shorts (trousers reaching only to the knees),  linen shirts, and pith helmets. These they wore with the ordinary  underclothing and with boots and puttees. This issue was completed  within ten days of arrival. It added considerably to the comfort of the  individual and the dress in itself was not unattractive. One individual  of French extraction refused for some unknown reason to wear the shorts.  He was proof against persuasion and eventually had to be removed from  the Battalion and given an opportunity for fuller reflection.    Perhaps it was inevitable that the drastic change from the Australian to  the Egyptian climate, soil, and conditions of life, should adversely  affect the health of the individual. At any rate such turned out to be  the case, and for the first ten days after arrival at Abbasia there were  some 130 to 150 men out of action each day. The principal causes were an  acute form of diarrhoea and tonsilitis. Amongst others were severe  colds, septic hands, knees, and feet, ophthalmia, and two or three  slight cases of heat stroke. Measles did not re-appear after the landing  at Suez, although the camp was placed in quarantine for 14 days and  visits to the neighbouring towns were forbidden. After the tenth day the  number of cases reporting to the medical officer began to decrease and  by the 20th July had dropped to 50, about which figure it remained  during the following few weeks. One death occurred--that of  Lance-Corporal J. K. Quick, of \"B\" Company, who succumbed to pneumonia  on the 14th August whilst a patient in No. 1 Australian General  Hospital.    To assist in the preservation of health everyone was encouraged to lie  down during the heat of the day, to keep the hair of the head cut short,  make frequent use of the shower baths, and consume no liquor, except  such as could be obtained within the camp. Undoubtedly the root cause of  many of the ailments was the pollution of the desert soil. One had only  to observe the habits of the natives to become aware that the earth of  Cairo and its environs was saturated with the filth of ages. This was  stirred up by the feet of the infantrymen in training and by the horses  going to exercise or water. Horses were numerous about this time. The  brigades of Light Horse on Gallipoli had left their mounts behind.  These, augmented in August by the 2nd Mounted Division, totalled nearly  10,000, and were cared for in a large Remount Depot established not far  from Abbasia Camp. The dust caused by them was at times almost  intolerable and the subject of frequent protests by those who soldiered  on foot.    [Illustration: MAJOR J. KENNY, A.A.M.C.  The Regimental Medical Officer.]    [Illustration: CAPTAIN J. J. S. SCOULER.  Signalling Officer, 1915-16.]    The method of dealing with the sick was as follows: A \"sick parade\" was  held daily at the medical officer's tent at 5.30 a.m. and again at 2.30  p.m. All men feeling unwell attended this parade, were examined, and  were prescribed for according to their condition. If their symptoms were  those of a complaint likely to lay them up, or render them unfit for  duty for several days, they would be \"evacuated\" to a neighbouring  hospital and detained there for treatment. Once a man was evacuated he  ceased, for all practical purposes, to be a member of the Battalion and  came under the control of the medical administration. If he was quickly  cured of his complaint he was sent back to his unit. If, on the other  hand, his recovery was retarded, he remained for some time in hospital,  or in a convalescent depot, and, perhaps, finally returned to Australia  either for a change or discharge.    Through sickness, transfers, and one or two other causes, the wastage in  the Battalion was considerable. This was partly replaced on the 17th  August by a first draft from the reinforcements camped at Zeitun. Lieut.  J. Quilty brought over 84 and 54, respectively, from the 1st and 2nd  Reinforcements. These were also first class men and were quickly  absorbed into the companies.    Factors which affect the conduct and character of a soldier on active  service are numerous and all weighty. Amongst them may be mentioned his  treatment as regards work, food, pay, recreation and amusement, and  mails from home. The first two of these have already been referred to  and, after reflection, it cannot reasonably be said that whilst in Egypt  he received too much of either. Pay very early became a vexed question.  Letters from relatives indicated that the distribution of allotment  money and separation allowance was being very imperfectly carried  out--resulting in much hardship and consequent anxiety. Although this  was eventually straightened out, it unsettled many men and bred a spirit  of discontent very difficult to allay and eradicate. The pay of the  troops themselves was drastically affected by the issue, in mid-August,  of an order limiting the drawing to two-fifths of the daily rate. The  exact reasons for this restriction were not given, but it is believed  that those responsible desired, firstly, to remove the distinction which  existed between the British and Australian rates and, secondly, to  encourage thrift and retain for the soldier on his discharge a sum,  beyond his deferred pay, which could be spent more wisely in Australia  and not go to fill the pockets of the Egyptians. To many this  restriction was a genuine hardship, whilst others circumvented it by  drawing on their private funds by means of the cable service. This was  extensively done, and those who had the wherewithal established a system  for regularly receiving remittances from the home land. Payments were  made in the local currency--the Egyptian pound of 100 piastres being  equal to L1 0s. 6-1/4d. The piastre (sometimes termed \"disaster\") was worth  about 2-1/2d. There was a smaller coin--a millieme--equal to one-tenth  of a piastre. English and Australian sovereigns were at first plentiful,  but an attempt was made to restrict their circulation, as it was  believed that the natives were hoarding them.    Mails arrived from Australia every week or ten days, and were heartily  welcomed. Those who received newspapers handed them round for others to  read. The Australian proved himself an inveterate letter writer and  found much to describe to his relatives and friends. The signallers were  rather noted for the amount of work they gave the officer who had to  sight their correspondence. They seemed to devote much time to writing  and to have a large circle of lady friends. As a rule, the soldier  observed the censor's injunctions, and, in doing so, made the work of  his officer light. Occasionally a transgression came under notice. In  such cases, the letter was either returned to the writer or the  offending part struck out. In one instance, the soldier had drawn  attention to the harrowing conditions under which he said he was  living--working from dawn to dark, with little or no food, and without  pay. Questioned as to his reason for this action, he confessed that he  was short of money and had intended to so play on the feelings of his  friends as to prompt them to send him financial aid.    Censoring letters was a valuable education for an officer. It gave him a  deep personal knowledge of the men he commanded and was to lead. It also  enabled him to realise that in most situations there were points of view  other than his own. He was the better for the knowledge. There were many  letters to read. Most had a grave earnest tone running through them.  Some were pathetic. Others were humorous and, again, others cleverly  descriptive of the passing life and scenes. The trend of thought of some  soldiers will be illustrated by the following:--In 1916, whilst  assisting to hold the trenches in front of Messines, a member of the  Battalion wrote a lengthy and comprehensive criticism of a recent book  dealing with the Darwinian theory. About the same time, and from the  same place, another member--a brave and sincere man, but a little  pharisaical--violated the censorship requirements by criticising the  army system generally and his own comrades in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#11)"],[1,"length, but only eighteen inches or two feet wide, and three or four  feet deep. To this spot the bear turned; and when, on crossing the  chasm, the bight of the rope fell into it, he placed himself across the  opening; then suspending himself by his hind feet, with a leg on each  side, he dropped his head and most all of his body into the chasm; and  with a foot applied to each side of the neck, tried for some minutes to  push the rope over his head.    Finding that this scheme did not work, he moved to the main ice, and  running with great force from the ship, gave a strong put on the rope;  then going backward a few steps, he repeated the jerk. At length, after  repeated attempts to make his escape in this way, every failure of which  he announced with an angry growl, he gave himself up to his hard fate,  and lay down on the ice in angry and sullen silence.    [Illustration]          LXXXIV    DECEIVING THE FOWLER      A young pointer, out with his master hunting, ran on a brood of very  small partridges. The old bird cried, fluttered, and ran trembling along  just before the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable  distance; when she took wing and flew farther off, but not out of the  field. At this the dog went back nearly to the place where the young  ones lay concealed in the grass. The old bird no sooner saw this than  she flew back again, settled first before the dog's nose, and a second  time acted the same part, rolling and tumbling about till she drew off  his attention from the brood, and thus succeeded in saving them.    [Illustration]          LXXXV    ASKING ASSISTANCE      A party of a ship's crew was sent ashore on a part of the coast of  India, for the purpose of cutting wood for the ship. One of the men,  having strayed from the rest, was greatly frightened by the appearance  of a large lioness, who came toward him. But when she had come up to  him, she lay down at his feet, and looked very earnestly, first at him,  and then at a tree a short distance off. After doing this several times,  she arose and started toward the tree, looking back at the man several  times, as if trying to make him follow her. At length he went, and when  he reached the tree, he saw a huge baboon with two young cubs in her  arms. He supposed they must belong to the lioness, as she lay down like  a cat, and seemed to be watching them very anxiously. The man being  afraid to climb the tree, decided to cut it down, and having his axe  with him, he at once set to work, the lioness, meantime, watching to see  what he was doing. When the tree fell, she sprang upon the baboon, and  after tearing her in pieces, she turned round and fawned round the man,  rubbing her head against him in great fondness, and in token of her  gratitude for the service he had done her. After this she took the cubs  away, one at a time, and the man went back to the ship.    [Illustration]          LXXXVI    DOG SMUGGLERS      In the Netherlands, they use dogs of a very large and strong breed as  they would horses. They are harnessed like horses, and chiefly employed  in drawing little carts filled with fish, vegetables, and other produce.  Before the year 1795, such dogs were also employed in smuggling; which  was the easier, as they are exceedingly docile.    The dogs were trained to go back and forth between two places on the  frontiers, without any person to attend them. Being well loaded with  little parcels of goods, lace, and the like, they set out at midnight,  and went only when it was perfectly dark. An excellent, quick-scented  dog always went some paces before the others, stretched out his nose  toward all quarters, and when he scented custom house officers, turned  back, which was the signal for immediate flight.    Concealed behind bushes, or in ditches, the dogs waited till all was  safe, then continued their journey, and at last reached, beyond the  frontier, the dwelling-house of the receiver of the goods, who was in  the secret. But here, also, the leading dog only at first showed  himself. On a certain whistle, which was a signal that all was right,  they all hastened up. They were then unloaded, taken to a nearby  stable, where there was a good layer of hay and plenty of good food.  There they rested until midnight, and they then returned in the same  manner as they had come, back over the frontiers.    [Illustration]          LXXXVII    PORUS SAVED BY HIS ELEPHANT      King Porus, in a battle with Alexander the Great, being severely  wounded, fell from the back of his elephant. The Macedonian soldiers,  supposing him dead, pushed forward, in order to rob him of his rich  clothing and accoutrements; but the faithful elephant, standing over the  body of its master, boldly drove back every one who dared to come near,  and while the enemy stood at bay, took the bleeding Porus up with his  trunk, and placed him again on his back.    The troops of Porus came by this time to his relief, and the king was  saved; but the elephant died of the wounds which it had so bravely  received in the heroic defense of its master.    [Illustration]          LXXXVIII    A HUMANE SOCIETY      A large colony of rooks had lived for many years in a grove on the banks  of a river. One quiet evening the idle birds amused themselves with  chasing one another through endless mazes, and in their flight they made  the air sound with many discordant noises. In the midst of this play, it  unfortunately happened that one of the rooks, by a sudden turn, struck  his head against the wing of another. The wounded bird instantly fell  into the river. A general cry of distress followed. The birds hovered  with every expression of anxiety over their distressed companion.    Encouraged by their sympathy, and perhaps by the language of counsel  known to themselves, he sprang into the air, and by one strong effort  reached the point of a rock that projected into the river. The joy  became loud and universal; but, alas! it was soon changed into notes of  sorrow, for the poor, wounded bird, in trying to fly toward his nest,  dropped again into the river, and was drowned.    [Illustration]          LXXXIX    A MOTHER WATCHING HER YOUNG      The following singular instance of the far-sighted watchfulness of the  mother turkey over her young is told by a French priest. \"I have heard,\"  he says, \"a mother turkey, when at the head of her brood, send forth the  most hideous scream, without being able to see any cause for it. Her  young ones, however, the moment the warning was given, hid under the  bushes, the grass, or whatever else seemed to offer shelter or  protection. They even stretched themselves at full length on the ground,  and lay as motionless as if dead.    In the meantime, the mother, with her eyes directed upward, kept up her  cries and screaming as before. On looking up in the direction in which  she seemed to gaze, I discovered a black spot just under the clouds, but  was unable at first to decide what it was. However, it soon appeared to  be a bird of prey, though at first at too great a distance to be  distinguished. I have seen one of those mother turkeys continue in this  agitated state for four hours at a stretch, and her whole brood pinned  down to the ground, as it were, the whole of that time, while their foe  has taken its circuits, has mounted and hovered directly over their  heads. When he, at last, disappeared, the mother changed her note and  sent forth a different sort of cry, which in an instant gave life to  the whole trembling brood, and they all flocked round her with  expressions of pleasure, as if conscious of their happy escape from  danger.\"    [Illustration]          XC    A REFUGEE SQUIRREL      A squirrel, whose bad luck it was to be captured, was lodged for safe  keeping in a trap used for taking rats alive. Here he remained for  several weeks, till at length, panting for liberty, he managed to make  his escape through a window, and went back once more to his native  fields.    The family in which he had been pet, were not a little vexed at the loss  of their little favorite, and the servant was ordered in the evening of  the same day to remove the trap, that they might no longer be reminded  of their loss. When he went to do this, he found to his surprise that  the squirrel, all wet and ruffled by the storm, had come back, and again  taken up his lodgings in the corner of the trap.    [Illustration]          XCI    ESCAPE OF JENGIS KAHN      The Mogul and Kalmuc Tartars give to the white owl credit for preserving  Jengis Khan, the founder of their empire; and they pay it, on that  account, almost divine honors. The prince, with a small army, happened  to be surprised and put to flight by his enemies. Forced to seek  concealment in a coppice, a white owl settled on the bush under which he  was hidden. At the sight of this bird, the prince's pursuers never  thought of searching the spot, thinking it impossible that such a bird  would perch where any human being was concealed. Jengis escaped, and  ever after his countrymen held the white owl sacred, and every one wore  a plume of its feathers on his head. The Kalmucs continue the custom to  this day, at all their great festivals; and some tribes have an idol in  the form of an owl, to which they fasten the real legs of this bird.    [Illustration]          XCII    A SHREWD GUESSER      A French officer, more remarkable for his birth and spirit than his  wealth, had served the Venetian republic for some years with great valor  and fidelity, but had not met with that preferment which he deserved.  One day he waited on a nobleman whom he had often solicited in vain, but  on whose friendship he had still some reliance. The reception he met  with was cool and mortifying; the nobleman turned his back upon the  veteran, and left him to find his way to the street through a suite of  apartments magnificently furnished.    He passed them lost in thought, till, casting his eyes"]]]
