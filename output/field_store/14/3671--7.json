[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3284"],[0,"The Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#11)"],[1,"worth thinking of, with a  view to a sporting tour as well as scientific investigation.    A circumstance arose here, which, insignificant though it appeared,  is worth noting, to show how careful one must be in understanding and  dealing with negro servants. Quite unaccountably to myself, the general  of my Wanguana, Baraka, after showing much discontent with his position  as head of Captain Grant's establishment, became so insolent, that it  was necessary to displace him, and leave him nothing to do but look  after the men. This promoted Frij, who enjoyed his rise as much as  Baraka, if his profession was to be believed, enjoyed his removal from  that office. Though he spoke in this manner, still I knew that there was  something rankling in his mind which depressed his spirits as long as he  remained with us, though what it was I could not comprehend, nor did I  fully understand it till months afterwards. It was ambition, which was  fast making a fiend of him; and had I known it, he would, and with great  advantage too, have been dismissed upon the spot. The facts were these:  He was exceedingly clever, and he knew it. His command over men was  surprising. At Zanzibar he was the Consul's right-hand man: he ranked  above Bombay in the consular boat's crew, and became a terror even to  the Banyans who kept slaves. He seemed, in fact, in his own opinion, to  have imbibed all the power of the British Consul who had instructed him.  Such a man was an element of discord in our peaceful caravan. He was far  too big-minded for the sphere which he occupied; and my surprise now  is that he ever took service, knowing what he should, at the time of  enlistment, have expected, that no man would be degraded to make room  for him. But this was evidently what he had expected, though he dared  not say it. He was jealous of Bombay, because he thought his position  over the money department was superior to his own over the men; and he  had seen Bombay, on one occasion, pay a tax in Uzaramo--a transaction  which would give him consequence with the native chiefs. Of Sheikh Said  he was equally jealous, for a like reason; and his jealousy increased  the more that I found it necessary to censure the timidity of this  otherwise worthy little man. Baraka thought, in his conceit, that he  could have done all things better, and gained signal fame, had he been  created chief. Perhaps he thought he had gained the first step towards  this exalted rank, and hence his appearing very happy for this time.  I could not see through so deep a scheme and only hoped that he would  shortly forget, in the changes of the marching life, those beautiful  wives he had left behind him, which Bombay in his generosity tried to  persuade me was the cause of his mental distraction.    Our halt at the ford here was cut short by the increasing sickness of  the Hottentots, and the painful fact that Captain Grant was seized with  fever. [6] We had to change camp to the little village of Kiruru, where,  as rice was grown--an article not to be procured again on this side of  Unyamuezi--we stopped a day to lay in supplies of this most valuable of  all travelling food. Here I obtained the most consistent accounts of the  river system which, within five days' journey, trends through Uzegura;  and I concluded, from what I heard, that there is no doubt of the  Mukondokua and Wami rivers being one and the same stream. My informants  were the natives of the settlement, and they all concurred in saying  that the Kingani above the junction is called the Rufu, meaning the  parent stream. Beyond it, following under the line of the hills, at one  day's journey distant, there is a smaller river called Msonge. At  an equal distance beyond it, another of the same size is known as  Lungerengeri; and a fourth river is the Wami, which mouths in the sea at  Utondue, between the ports of Whindi and Saadami. In former years, the  ivory-merchants, ever seeking for an easy road for their trade, and  knowing they would have no hills to climb if they could only gain a  clear passage by this river from the interior plateau to the sea, made  friends with the native chiefs of Uzegura, and succeeded in establishing  it as a thoroughfare. Avarice, however, that fatal enemy to the negro  chiefs, made them overreach themselves by exorbitant demands of taxes.  Then followed contests for the right of appropriating the taxes, and the  whole ended in the closing of the road, which both parties were equally  anxious to keep open for their mutual gain. This foolish disruption  having at first only lasted for a while, the road was again opened and  again closed, for the merchants wanted an easy passage, and the native  chiefs desired cloths. But it was shut again; and now we heard of its  being for a third time opened, with what success the future only can  determine--for experience WILL not teach the negro, who thinks only for  the moment. Had they only sense to see, and patience to wait, the  whole trade of the interior would inevitably pass through their country  instead of Uzaramo; and instead of being poor in cloths, they would  be rich and well dressed like their neighbours. But the curse of Noah  sticks to these his grandchildren by Ham, and no remedy that has yet  been found will relieve them. They require a government like ours in  India; and without it, the slave trade will wipe them off the face of  the earth.    Now leaving the open parks of pretty acacias, we followed up the Mgazi  branch of the Mgeta, traversed large tree-jungles, where the tall  palm is conspicuous, and drew up under the lumpy Mkambaku, to find  a residence for the day. Here an Arab merchant, Khamis, bound for  Zanzibar, obliged us by agreeing for a few dollars to convey our recent  spoils in natural history to the coast.    My plans for the present were to reach Zungomero as soon as possible,  as a few days' halt would be required there to fix the longitude of the  eastern flank of the East Coast Range by astronomical observation;  but on ordering the morning's march, the porters--too well fed and  lazy--thought our marching-rate much too severe, and resolutely refused  to move. They ought to have made ten miles a-day, but preferred doing  five. Argument was useless, and I was reluctant to apply the stick,  as the Arabs would have done when they saw their porters trifling  with their pockets. Determining, however, not to be frustrated in this  puerile manner, I ordered the bugler to sound the march, and started  with the mules and coast-men, trusting to Sheikh and Baraka to bring on  the Wanyamuezi as soon as they could move them. The same day we crossed  the Mgazi where we found several Wakhutu spearing fish in the muddy  hovers of its banks.    We slept under a tree, and this morning found a comfortable residence  under the eaves of a capacious hut. The Wanyamuezi porters next came  in at their own time, and proved to us how little worth are orders in  a land where every man, in his own opinion, is a lord, and no laws  prevail. Zungomero, bisected by the Mgeta, lies on flat ground, in a  very pretty amphitheatre of hills, S. lat. 7 deg. 26' 53\", and E. long.  37 deg. 36' 45\". It is extremely fertile, and very populous, affording  everything that man can wish, even to the cocoa and papwa fruits;  but the slave-trade has almost depopulated it, and turned its once  flourishing gardens into jungles. As I have already said, the people who  possess these lands are cowardly by nature, and that is the reason why  they are so much oppressed. The Wasuahili, taking advantage of their  timidity, flock here in numbers to live upon the fruits of their  labours. The merchants on the coast, too, though prohibited by their  Sultan from interfering with the natural course of trade, send their  hungry slaves, as touters, to entice all approaching caravans to  trade with their particular ports, authorising the touters to pay such  premiums as may be necessary for the purpose. Where they came from we  could not ascertain; but during our residence, a large party of the  Wasuahili marched past, bound for the coast, with one hundred head of  cattle, fifty slaves in chains, and as many goats. Halts always end  disastrously in Africa, giving men time for mischief;--and here was an  example of it. During the target-practice, which was always instituted  on such occasions to give confidence to our men, the little pepper-box  Rahan, my head valet, challenged a comrade to a duel with carbines.  Being stopped by those around him, he vented his wrath in terrible  oaths, and swung about his arms, until his gun accidentally went off,  and blew his middle finger off.    Baraka next, with a kind of natural influence of affinity when a row is  commenced, made himself so offensive to Bombay, as to send him running  to me so agitated with excitement that I thought him drunk. He seized my  hands, cried, and implored me to turn him off. What could this mean?  I could not divine; neither could he explain, further than that he had  come to a determination that I must send either him or Baraka to the  right-about; and his first idea was that he, and not Baraka, should be  the victim. Baraka's jealousy about his position had not struck me yet.  I called them both together and asked what quarrel they had, but could  not extract the truth. Baraka protested that he had never given, either  by word or deed, the slightest cause of rupture; he only desired the  prosperity of the march, and that peace should reign throughout the  camp; but Bombay was suspicious of him, and malignantly abused him, for  what reason Baraka could not tell. When I spoke of this to Bombay, like  a bird fascinated by the eye of a viper, he shrank before the slippery  tongue of his opponent, and could only say, \"No, Sahib--oh no, that is  not it; you had better turn me off, for his tongue is so long, and mine  so short, you never will believe me.\" I tried to make them friends,  hoping it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#11)"],[1," hollow it out with the adze.\"    Mrs. Murray was greatly pleased. \"I'm very much obliged to you, Ranald,\"  she said, \"and I am glad I came down to see your camp. Now, if you will  ask me, I should like to see you make the sugar.\" Had her request been  made before the night of their famous ride, Ranald would have found  some polite reason for refusal, but now he was rather surprised to find  himself urging her to come to a sugaring-off at the close of the season.    \"I shall be delighted to come,\" cried Mrs. Murray, \"and it is very good  of you to ask me, and I shall bring my niece, who is coming with Mr.  Murray from town to spend some weeks with me.\"    Ranald's face fell, but his Highland courtesy forbade retreat. \"If she  would care,\" he said, doubtfully.    \"Oh, I am sure she would be very glad! She has never been outside of the  city, and I want her to learn all she can of the country and the woods.  It is positively painful to see the ignorance of these city children in  regard to all living things--beasts and birds and plants. Why, many of  them couldn't tell a beech from a basswood.\"    \"Oh, mother!\" protested Hughie, aghast at such ignorance.    \"Yes, indeed, it is dreadful, I assure you,\" said his mother, smiling.  \"Why, I know a grown-up woman who didn't know till after she was married  the difference between a spruce and a pine.\"    \"But you know them all now,\" said Hughie, a little anxious for his  mother's reputation.    \"Yes, indeed,\" said his mother, proudly; \"every one, I think, at least  when the leaves are out. So I want Maimie to learn all she can.\"    Ranald did not like the idea any too well, but after they had gone  his thoughts kept turning to the proposed visit of Mrs. Murray and her  niece.    \"Maimie,\" said Ranald to himself. \"So that is her name.\" It had  a musical sound, and was different from the names of the girls he  knew--Betsy and Kirsty and Jessie and Marget and Jinny. It was finer  somehow than these, and seemed to suit better a city girl. He wondered  if she would be nice, but he decided that doubtless she would be  \"proud.\" To be \"proud\" was the unpardonable sin with the Glengarry  boy. The boy or girl convicted of this crime earned the contempt of all  self-respecting people. On the whole, Ranald was sorry she was coming.  Even in school he was shy with the girls, and kept away from them. They  were always giggling and blushing and making one feel queer, and they  never meant what they said. He had no doubt Maimie would be like the  rest, and perhaps a little worse. Of course, being Mrs. Murray's niece,  she might be something like her. Still, that could hardly be. No girl  could ever be like the minister's wife. He resolved he would turn Maimie  over to Don. He remembered, with great relief, that Don did not mind  girls; indeed, he suspected Don rather enjoyed playing the \"forfeit\"  games at school with them, in which the penalties were paid in kisses.  How often had he shuddered and admired from a distance, while Don and  the others played those daring games! Yes, Don would do the honors for  Maimie. Perhaps Don would even venture to play \"forfeits\" with her.  Ranald felt his face grow hot at this thought. Then, with sudden  self-detection, he cried, angrily, aloud: \"I don't care; let him; he may  for all I care.\"    \"Who may what?\" cried a voice behind him. It was Don himself.    \"Nothing,\" said Ranald, blushing shamefacedly.    \"Why, what are you mad about?\" asked Don, noticing his flushed face.    \"Who is mad?\" said Ranald. \"I am not mad whatever.\"    \"Well, you look mighty like it,\" said Don. \"You look mad enough to  fight.\"    But Ranald, ignoring him, simply said, \"We will need to be gathering the  sap this evening, for the troughs will be full.\"    \"Huh-huh,\" said Don. \"I guess we can carry all there is to-day, but we  will have to get the colt to-morrow. Got the spiles ready?\"    \"Enough for to-day,\" said Ranald, wondering how he could tell Don of  the proposed visit of Mrs. Murray and her niece. Taking each a bundle of  spiles and an ax, the boys set out for the part of the sugar bush as yet  untapped, and began their work.    \"The minister's wife and Hughie were here just now,\" began Ranald.    \"Huh-huh, I met them down the road. Hughie said he was coming day after  to-morrow.\"    \"Did Mrs. Murray tell you--\"    \"Tell me what?\"    \"Did she tell you she would like to see a sugaring-off?\"    \"No; they didn't stop long enough to tell me anything. Hughie shouted at  me as they passed.\"    \"Well,\" said Ranald, speaking slowly and with difficulty, \"she wanted  bad to see the sugar-making, and I asked her to come.\"    \"You did, eh? I wonder at you.\"    \"And she wanted to bring her niece, and--and--I let her,\" said Ranald.    \"Her niece! Jee-roo-sa-LEM!\" cried Don. \"Do you know who her niece is?\"    \"Not I,\" said Ranald, looking rather alarmed.    \"Well, she is the daughter of the big lumberman, St. Clair, and she is a  great swell.\"    Ranald stood speechless.    \"That does beat all,\" pursued Don; \"and you asked her to our camp?\"    Then Ranald grew angry. \"And why not?\" he said, defiantly. \"What is  wrong about that?\"    \"O, nothing much,\" laughed Don, \"if I had done it, but for you, Ranald!  Why, what will you do with that swell young lady from the city?\"    \"I will just do nothing,\" said Ranald. \"There will be you and Mrs.  Murray, and--\"    \"Oh, I say,\" burst in Don, \"that's bully! Let's ask some of the boys,  and--your aunt, and--my mother, and--some of the girls.\"    \"Oh, shucks!\" said Ranald, angrily. \"You just want Marget Aird.\"    \"You get out!\" cried Don, indignantly; \"Marget Aird!\" Then, after a  pause, he added, \"All right, I don't want anybody else. I'll look after  Mrs. Murray, and you and Maimie can do what you like.\"    This combination sounded so terrible to Ranald that he surrendered at  once; and it was arranged that there should be a grand sugaring-off, and  that others besides the minister's wife and her niece should be invited.    But Mrs. Murray had noticed the falling of Ranald's face at the mention  of Maimie's visit to the camp, and feeling that she had taken him at  a disadvantage, she determined that she would the very next day put  herself right with him. She was eager to follow up the advantage she had  gained the day before in establishing terms of friendship with Ranald,  for her heart went out to the boy, in whose deep, passionate nature she  saw vast possibilities for good or ill. On her return from her daily  visit to Macdonald Dubh, she took the camp road, and had the good  fortune to find Ranald alone, \"rigging up\" his kettles preparatory  to the boiling. But she had no time for kettles to-day, and she went  straight to her business.    \"I came to see you, Ranald,\" she said, after she had shaken hands with  him, \"about our sugaring-off. I've been thinking that it would perhaps  be better to have no strangers, but just old friends, you and Don and  Hughie and me.\"    Ranald at once caught her meaning, but found himself strangely unwilling  to be extricated from his predicament.    \"I mean,\" said Mrs. Murray, frankly, \"we might enjoy it better without  my niece; and so, perhaps, we could have the sugaring when I come to  bring Hughie home on Friday. Maimie does not come till Saturday.\"    Her frankness disarmed Ranald of his reserve. \"I know well what you  mean,\" he said, without his usual awkwardness, \"but I do not mind now  at all having your niece come; and Don is going to have a party.\" The  quiet, grave tone was that of a man, and Mrs. Murray looked at the boy  with new eyes. She did not know that it was her own frank confidence  that had won like confidence from him.    \"How old are you, Ranald?\" she said, in her wonder.    \"I will be going on eighteen.\"    \"You will soon be a man, Ranald.\" Ranald remained silent, and she went  on earnestly: \"A strong, good, brave man, Ranald.\"    The blood rushed to the boy's face with a sudden flood, but still he  stood silent.    \"I'm going to give you Hughie for two days,\" she continued, in the same  earnest voice; and leaning down over her pony's neck toward him: \"I want  him to know strong and manly boys. He is very fond of you, Ranald. He  thinks you are better than any man in the world.\" She paused, her lips  parting in a smile that made Ranald's heart beat quick. Then she went on  with a shy hesitancy: \"Ranald, I know the boys sometimes drop words they  should not and tell stories unfit to hear\"; the blood was beginning  to show in her cheek; \"and I would not like my little boy--\" Her voice  broke suddenly, but recovering quickly she went on in grave, sweet  tones: \"I trust him to you, Ranald, for this time and afterward. He  looks up to you. I want him to be a good, brave man, and to keep his  heart pure.\" Ranald could not speak, but he looked steadily into Mrs.  Murray's eyes as he took the hand she offered, and she knew he was  pledging himself to her.    \"You'll come for him to-morrow,\" she said, as she turned away. By this  time Ranald had found his voice.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" he replied. \"And I will take good care of him.\"    Once more Mrs. Murray found herself looking at Ranald as if seeing him  for the first time. He had the solemn voice and manner of a man making  oath of allegiance, and she rode away with her heart at rest concerning  her little boy. With Ranald, at least, he would be safe.                *         *         *         *         *    Those two days had been for Hughie long and weary, but at last the great  day came for him, as all great days will come for those who can wait.  Ranald appeared at the manse before the breakfast was well begun, and  Hughie, with the unconscious egoism of childhood, was for rushing off  without thought of preparation for himself or of farewell for those left  behind. Indeed, he was for leaving his porridge untasted, declaring he  \"wasn't a bit hungry,\" but his mother brought him to his senses.    \"No breakfast, no sugar bush to-day,"]]]
