I had my trap set in a spring and every  time he wanted to steal bait he could manage it without getting into  the trap. I let the trap set the same way and kept it baited but  meanwhile I was thinking of a plan to capture him. In fixing the  spring I made a dam out of dirt, placing a few small flat stones on  top of it. Now I made up my mind that as the dam was the nearest  point to the bait that he must be stealing it from that place. Now I  took the trap out of the spring and put in a stone covered with a  tuft of grass to resemble the trap and setting the trap itself in the  dam, covering with dirt and laying a little flat stone on the pan. I  had made up my mind that when he stepped on the dam he would step on  the small stones that I had laid on top to keep the dirt from washing  away. While stepping on the dam to reach for the bait he stepped on  the small stone on the pan and was held fast by a No. 2 1/2 Blake &  Lamb trap, just as I had calculated on.      * * *    One way of trapping fox is setting under water, especially in slow  moving water, is most effectual in killing the trap odor, says a  Michigan trapper. The metallic smell will not rise through water, but  will be absorbed and carried away by it. As much as a fortnight  before setting take a hoe and dig a shallow pool in a swamp where  foxes are known to cross. Dig it six or seven feet across in a mucky  ooze and leave a drain way or outlet open so that in event of rain  storms, water will not rise and stand too deep in the pool. The pool  should bear as few evidences as possible of having been made by man.  In the course of a fortnight after the scent of the trapper has faded  away and leaves have fallen, the trap is smeared with tallow and the  chain is fastened to long narrow stone, approaching so as to make and  leave as few tracks as possible. The trap along with the stone and  chain is set in the bottom of the pool, not in the center, but so  near one side that the trap will be from 12 to 14 inches from the low  bank. A little tuft of grass as large as a soda biscuit is placed  directly over the trap resting on it, so the top of the tuft will  show a little above the water, looking as though it grew there. About  a foot beyond it further out in the water another tuft a little  larger and thicker, is placed so it will show distinctly above the  water, and on it place the bait. A fox crossing the swamp on a chilly  day scenting the bait will approach the pool. To avoid wading in the  cold muddy water he will probably step on the nearest tuft. That is  the one on the trap in which he will be caught by the foreleg.      * * *    I will tell you what I know about the fox, says a Canadian trapper.  He is the slyest animal we have to deal with here. I think the best  way is to use several different ways to trap foxes, and your chances  will be doubled in taking them.    Take a horse or beef head and put it out in the woods and leave it  there for about a week. Then if the foxes have been at it, set your  traps and cover with leaves or dead pine needles. When you are  leaving take a brush and brush some snow over your traps to about  half cover the leaves. Leave no foot marks around and you will be  pretty sure to get your fox.    Another good way is to take tainted beef or pig kidneys and put them  at the back of a V, made by two logs falling across each other. I  took one this way before the snow came, but he got away with my trap.    I have read and heard a lot about human scent and animals being  afraid of it. I have seen enough to be sure that fox are not afraid  of either human scent or steel traps, if the dirt is not disturbed  around the trap.      * * *      [Illustration: CALIFORNIA TRAPPER VISITING TRAPS.]    When snow is plentiful so that sly Reynard may be tracked, then  search out his haunts and find where he sleeps in the day time, says  a Canadian hunter. They seldom go in holes in the winter, and in the  bright sunny days are very sleepy. In tracking you will see marks  where they have been lying, generally in some elevated position close  to their haunts, where they may be caught napping as they often are  caught. The snow should be soft so as to make the least noise  possible, but it is astonishing the amount of noise you can make and  still not disturb them, providing you have been thoughtful enough to  keep the wind in your favor, as they are very quick to smell a  person, so in consequence you should always face the wind and go easy  in your search. The snow shoes are a great help when the snow is  deep, as it is then that the fox is easiest gotten as they will not  go far in the deep snow. Try it boys and be surprised at your  success.      * * *    I will try and explain to you my method of catching fox alive, writes  Howard Hurst, of Pennsylvania. Take a common box trap, put a wire  partition about 4 inches from back end of trap. On the back end of  trap put a wire door that you can open and shut. Take the trap to  some good den, take a small live chicken and put in the back part of  trap. The noise of the chicken will attract the foxes' attention and  he will enter the trap door. I saw four caught this way last spring  by a boy 9 years old.      * * *    I will mention how you can get a fox without bait, says Jarvis Green,  of Maine. Look up an old path or wood road where you see that they  have traveled, and notice a mound or rise of ground; now the foxes  always stop to urinate on all such places. When you see the wind and  atmosphere indicates a fall of snow, go and set your trap, smear with  balsam of fir, cedar, hemlock or spruce, set your trap on center of  mound and on one side stick up a tree branch to look as if grown  there, about eight inches high, fasten trap to a clog by the middle,  cover trap lightly with some fine substance. A drop or two of scent  is sure of every one that comes along. Try this. The Blake & Lamb  trap is best. I have only one fault with the single spring and that  is the trencher is too large. On the new style if the animal steps on  the edge of trencher, result is a toe or two will be left. Be careful  in covering trap so that when it springs the jaws will shut tight.      * * *      [Illustration: PENNSYLVANIA FOX TRAPPER'S CABIN.]    When I was a boy I used to hunt foxes with dog and gun. In tracking  them I noticed that they would go to every skunk that was killed,  writes L. M. Cartwright, of Pennsylvania, near where they traveled,  and nose around, but never saw where they ate any of it, so I used  the scent successfully in catching them. I have caught many of them  in No. 1 Newhouse trap fastened to a clog; had one to pull the staple  out of a clog and carry trap as much as five miles before catching  him, and if it had not been for a fresh fall of snow would have been  out.    About as sure a way to catch fox (if you have the proper place) is to  snare him. Here they very often cross the creek on logs or trees that  have fallen across, when the creek is not frozen over. Take about  three and a half feet of wire, such as is used for baling hay, make a  snare, staple or spike the end of wire down on the side of the tree  about the center of the creek, bend wire up so the loop comes over  the center of log, make loop about seven or eight inches in diameter,  set small bush on each side, stick in log and cover just over top of  snare. If properly set will catch fox, coon and dogs (so it is best  to set where dogs do not travel).    I suppose any log up from the ground high enough would do by using  the scent from the female fox. Another way, drive a stake beside a  log, set trap about six to nine inches away, pour fish brine on stake  and see what it will do. This should be away from dogs.    My way of trapping the fox is by the old method. Take a bushel of  buckwheat chaff and where foxes travel nearly every night scatter it  about four feet around, and take a stick and pat the chaff down so it  is nice and smooth all over the bed. Then take tallow cracklings and  scatter them over the bed about a foot apart, then leave everything  natural, and as soon as a fox takes the bait place your trap (which  should be a double spring Newhouse or a No. 2 1/2 B. & L.) set it in  center of bed and cover about 3/4 or 1 inch with chaff. Put cotton  under pan so it will not hinder trap from springing. The trap should  be fastened to a clog or drag hook. I say to young trappers try my  way and you will be successful.      * * *    Do not spit or drop anything or touch anything with your bare hands,  says a Vermont trapper. Yes, I know some say animals are not afraid  of human scent. I have my ideas and know what I have to do to be  successful. If others can make a success in a different way I will  not disagree with them. You cut a stake, sharpen it at one end, cut  it about 15 inches long, about 1 inch in diameter; leave a prong  about three inches long and about three inches from top to stake down  trap. I will set this No. 2 1/2 Blake now. I ask all of you to pay  attention, as I have often made the assertion that I could set a fox  trap before 400 persons and not ten of them would make fox trappers.  Now let me set this trap and carry it set to this bank, which is a  sharp knoll about two feet high. I take my digger and cut a sod 6  inches square. Now I dig a hole back in the bank 6 or 8 inches and  about three inches across. Make the cavity large enough to set trap  about 3 inches deep, place ring over stake and drive stake in ground  under where you set the trap. Set trap so pan will be about three  inches from mouth of hole and square in front of hole. Now with  digger cover trap about 1/2 inch deep so it will be all covered  evenly. Put two pieces of bait in hole beyond trap and about three  inches from mouth, and one in further end of hole. Drop a few drops  of scent at mouth of hole and the thing is done. If you have paid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#11)"],[1,"seem to know  them all.    For bait I use fish oil, you can get it almost anywhere and it is  cheap and good, the older the better. Place a few drops on the end of  a tile, roots of a tree or stone, or in fact anywhere you have a trap  but not on your trap. I never put it on dead bait but just sprinkle  it around. A mink likes to kill his own game. Make him think there is  some around and hunt for it, which he surely will do if there is  nothing but the scent to find.    To be a successful mink trapper you must study his trails and set  your trap accordingly.    Most methods that I read for trapping the mink are for trapping in  the north or far north. Now some of them are good, while others are  useless here. From my observation of the habits of the mink in  Virginia, I don't think they have any fixed abode (in trapping season  any how). Wherever is most convenient after a full meal or light  overtakes them they den up for the day, and the next day may be  snugly sleeping under the roots of a blown over tree or under the  banks of a creek five miles away. The building of barricades of  rocks, old chunks or pens of sticks and bait within is time and labor  thrown away. Now, young trapper, I am going to give you four of my  favorite sets for mink, that if you will follow will give you some  success, if there are any mink where you are trapping.    Follow along ditches and find where they cross, usually called secret  ditches, which come into the main one, set your trap at the entrance  of the covered one a little under water, and cover with water soaked  leaves. Do not use bait but may use scent, or a decoy. One may be  fixed by making a box about 6 inches square, 12 or 18 inches long, of  old boards, with hoe plant in bank at desirable place so as to look  natural. Set your trap in front.    Another is to get a piece of hollow log 3 or 4 feet long, place in  mouth of ditch or branch where it comes into creek, anchor with  stakes or weigh down with stones, close one end, place trap at other,  under water if possible; place bait in log. This is a sure set for  coon. It took me nearly half a day last September to cut a log, get  it in branch and weigh down with stones to keep high water from  washing away, but caught four mink and two coon at the entrance.    Another is where banks are steep along small streams. Set trap in  water, cause anything that may come along to pass over trap by a row  of dead sticks, weeds or a bunch of old weeds. I have also caught  many by placing two old logs five or six feet long, four or five  inches apart in shallow water near a steep bank, cover with a larger  log. If you have plenty of traps you can set one in each end. Do not  use bait but can use scent. Be sure to search out all the old hollow  logs near streams and set trap in or near entrance--place bait in  log. By following these rules any one, where game is fairly  plentiful, can catch some mink.        CHAPTER XIV.    MANY GOOD METHODS.    Last winter I knew of at least eight trappers who were trapping for  mink along the same stream where I was trapping, and while all of  them combined caught four mink, I had the good luck of catching  thirteen in my traps and I shot one one morning, making fourteen in  all, says an Ohio trapper.    I wonder how many readers have ever heard a mink scream when in a  trap? I think it is the most blood-curdling hair-raising noise I have  ever heard; it is equal to the scream of a panther. I had great sport  last winter by sending some young boy trappers out to track a mink to  his den. I told them that all they had to do was to follow him to the  last hole he crawled into and then set their traps, but after  following him for about three miles they came back discouraged and  disappointed. They said he had gone into about one thousand holes,  but had always come out again, and such was a fact.    I don't know how they do in other parts of the country, but here it  is next to impossible to track one down; it looks as if they never  stop. I have followed them for six miles already and they were still  going on; I don't believe that they have any regular den or hole  after the breeding season is over; you just have to catch them on the  run.    One evening last fall I was sitting on the creek bank fishing when a  very large mink came up the creek by me and he was a curiosity; his  tail was just as white as snow. I tried awfully hard to get hold of  him last winter, but failed. I presume he never stopped until he  reached the north pole.    I have two methods for trapping them; one is to find a hole along  some stream, an old muskrat or woodchuck hole is best. If there are  no holes it is an easy matter to make one. It is a well known habit  of the mink to be crawling into every hole he comes to, and I have  known them to go one hundred yards out of their path, just for the  pleasure of investigating an old woodchuck hole.    After finding a suitable hole for setting your trap, throw a piece of  muskrat liberally doped with equal parts of oil of peppermint and  sweet oil back in the hole, and set your trap at the entrance; use a  little care in concealing the trap and sprinkle a few drops of the  above oil over the trap, and you may be sure of having the pleasure  of skinning the first mink that comes along.    I have caught them as far as two miles from any stream in my coon and  fox traps, so that goes to prove that they do not stay along the  streams altogether.    Another method I use, and the one I consider the best, is to go along  the banks of some stream, where you are sure that mink are in the  habit of traveling, then get four old boards, six or eight feet long  and six inches wide, (if necessary logs can be used instead of  boards) then stake them down on their edges so that they will form  the letter X, only instead of crossing them leave a small opening of  three or four inches like this X for the mink to run through, then  set the trap a few inches either way from the center, or two traps  can be set, one on each side of the center. They will never jump over  the boards, but instead they will guide them over the trap.    After an experience of 34 years in trapping mink I presume I can  give a few points, writes Mr. Moses Bone, of Iowa, that may help  younger trappers who wish to trap mink. The mink is very cunning  and hard to catch in a steel trap unless you know how and where to  set, which is about the only secret there is in catching mink. I have  had people write to know what scent I used and how I set traps. A man  can learn better methods as long as he traps--experience is the best  teacher--and unless he is willing to work hard he will never make a  successful trapper of any kind of game. A trapper simply wants to  shoulder his traps early in the morning and travel ten, twenty and  perhaps thirty miles a day; he must foot it, for no other method of  traveling will do. The writer has done it many times, starting before  daylight and not getting home until after dark.    As before stated, my experience as a mink trapper began 34 years ago,  my brother and I trapping together, and we began putting out our  traps the first week in November, 1867. There were very few trappers  then and mink were plentiful. In four weeks we caught 101 mink and 50  muskrats. The mink were mostly in prime condition and brought  $300.00. Rats at this time were worth 25 cents each.    At the beginning of the trapping season my brother in one night  caught 15 mink, the largest catch I ever knew. In 1873 I caught 10  mink in one night, but it took two days to visit my traps, walking 60  miles. In 1878 I caught 15 mink in one hole where the water ran all  winter, and I never had to bait the trap as the scent was enough to  attract every mink coming near. In the past three years I have caught  90 mink within a mile of home. Several years ago I caught 8 in one  place.    I use steel traps, not so many as I used to, as trappers are numerous  nowadays. Water set was always my favorite way of catching mink,  setting about two inches under water, in a spring, ditch or where the  water ran swift, otherwise the water will freeze over. Of course when  very cold weather comes, dry land sets must be resorted to. I always  use No. 1 steel traps. No. 1 1/2 is better for skunk or coon. For  bait use chicken, rabbit, or still better, muskrat, but they must be  strictly fresh.    In order to make mink trapping interesting one must make it pay, and  where there are plenty of the animals the scientific trapper can make  it pay, for they are about as easily caught as any other game when  you understand your business. Mink fur is not good and prime before  the middle of November in Iowa and states in same latitude, and it is  useless to catch them earlier.    When you see signs of the mink set your trap as near as you can get  to a spring, ditch or running water with a steep bank a foot or more  high. Here dig a hole in the bank 6 or 8 inches inward and low enough  to let the water flow in. Now get a forked stick, cut off one fork  say an inch long, leaving the other 6 or 8 inches long. Sharpen the  end of the long fork and run it through your bait (remember bait must  be fresh) up to the fork. The bait is now fastened on the stick and  run it in the bank back in the hole as far as you can.    If any mink comes along they will find it. Set your trap near  entrance, but always in the current. Take weeds or sticks, say a foot  long, stick them in the mud, making a lane so the mink must pass over  the trap in order to get the bait.    If you wish a good scent to draw mink in the spring of the year,  collect the scent bags of the muskrat and preserve them in alcohol,  to which is added 5 cents worth of oil of cumin if you like. I  discarded all scents, however, 30 years ago, finding nothing better  than fresh bait, the more bloody the better. The mink has a good  smeller. For dry land set I go on the same principles, but "]]]
