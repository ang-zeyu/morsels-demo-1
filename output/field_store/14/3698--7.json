In this connection we quote from an article in a current magazine,  the truth of the contentions being borne out to a greater or less  extent by our own observations:    After her puppies are about five weeks of age a bitch will begin to  vomit the contents of her stomach for the puppies. I have known many  breeders of experience argue that but few bitches do so. Over and  over again have I been able to convince persons who, having immediate  care of the bitch and her litter, deny that the bitch ever vomits to  her puppies, that they are wrong. Many bitches never vomit when the  attendant is about, and only appear to do so at night; hence the  belief that they do not do so at all. It is the natural manner in  which the bitch feeds her whelp with partially digested food, after  her milk supply ceases to suffice for their requirements. If the  bitch is of good constitution and in good health, the puppies  flourish remarkably on the diet thus provided, and in such cases my  experience leads me to believe that puppies left with their dams do  better than when separated from them and, strange to say, bitches who  are in the habit of picking up all sorts of apparently undesirable  odds and ends do not seem to do their puppies less well under these  circumstances than cleaner feeders do.    Many bitches eat the young soon as they come if not closely watched,  especially the first time. There should be an attendant at time of  whelping. Whelps must be removed to a basket of warm cloths and kept  away till all have come and then place to matron for nursing. There  is no danger of her devouring them thereafter.    To resume: This is what I feed pups: grind rye without bolting and  sometimes oats ground very fine; then run through a coarse sieve, and  bake into bread without soda or baking powder, or make into a thick  mush and feed it with plenty of milk if convenient. As they grow  older add cornmeal and scraps from the butcher shop to the feed, and  give them enough to keep them nice and sleek, but do not overfeed.    By the time they are three weeks old they will be running everywhere,  and let them have plenty of room to run and play. Change their beds  as often as needed, which is a good way to prevent fleas. Should  fleas get on them as they are sure to do, put a tablespoonful of oil  of tar in a quart of warm water, take a fine tooth comb, dip in tar  water, and comb them until the hair is thoroughly saturated;  repeating as often as needed.    For bedding, the best is leaves from the woods; straw will answer,  but I prefer the leaves to anything I have ever tried, but whatever  is used it should be changed often and kept dry. For the dog with a  damp place to sleep, will soon have the mange, and it is far easier  to keep a dog healthy than to cure him after he has become diseased.  In warm weather I use no bedding as it is only a harbor for vermin.    The best place by far, to keep your dogs, is in a park, where there  is shade in summer, with running water, and slope enough to the land,  to allow it to be well washed whenever it rains. Then provide dry,  comfortable quarters to sleep, and you have an ideal home for dogs.  In case you cannot have a place of this kind nor even a small park,  and must keep your dog chained, attach a good heavy wire to the dog  house and the other end to a tree, where your dog can get to a shade  if possible; then attach a chain to the wire so your dog can travel  along the wire; but be sure that he cannot get tangled up and have to  lay out some wet night.    Some are situated far better than others for taking care of dogs and  I am sorry to say there is an occasional sportsman (or at least he  owns a dog or two), who is inclined to let his dogs shift for  themselves. I pity the dog that is unfortunate enough to have such an  owner.    My experience is that too much meat is not good for the foxhound, and  if they get a mess of old stale meat just before you want to run  them, the chances are that they can't make the race. I have seen good  dogs that couldn't run an hour, simply because they were filled up  with old dead hog or horse. If you want to make a good race with your  dog, keep him tied two or three days before you intend to run him,  feed him corn bread (well baked) and sweet milk. If you run at night,  give your dog a good feed at noon and very little at night when you  start, and if your hound has the \"stuff\" in him he is good for all  night.    I think rotten meat will affect the smelling of a dog as well as heat  them up, so they can't make a good race. To let your dog run loose  until you are ready for a chase, where he can find slop and such  stuff to be filled up on, and have your friend meet you with his  hounds in fine shape and lead your hound all the time, well you know  how you would feel.    Some say you must have it bred in a hound to run. That is all true  enough, but a well bred hound with all grit can't make a good race if  he isn't in shape to do it.    The foregoing is borne out and added detail given in the following  contribution from New York State:    I find that fox hounds which I feed on old stinking pork or stinking  meat of any kind are quite stupid and very careless about hunting.  They cannot keep on the trail, neither do they wish to run fast or  continue running long. Old stinking pork seems to be the worst I  could feed to a fox hound, and corn bread and some milk on it seems  to be the best.    When my dogs are fed on cornbread and milk they display the most  activity, and can follow a fox or rabbit more accurately and  accordingly run faster. When I want to make my hound run slow I feed  him some meat, and the more it stinks the less he can smell anything  but the fumes of this in his stomach. I can easily tell by the smell  of my dog's breath whether he has eaten fresh mutton or rotten horse  recently, and I think any healthy person  can easily.    Here are another hunter's views on this same subject:    In rearing hounds, to have them hardy and intelligent you must feed  them right and provide them with a lot of good fresh water as well as  to give them daily exercise. When I feed beef, I have a small axe  with which I chop all the bones into fine pieces. They also get  scraps from the table with some vegetables mixed with cooked rolled  oats. I feed the old ones once a day with raw meat and once with  porridge. I see that they get just enough to keep them always in good  running condition, that is neither fat nor thin. I like a dog with a  good rolling skin. I never take a skeleton dog in the woods as I have  often seen hunters going deer hunting with dogs which you could read  a newspaper through.    Now of what use are such animals as these? Some say that a thin dog  will run better than a fat one. Yes, if the fat one is hog fat; but a  dog with about one-half inch of hard fat on the ribs will out-do a  dozen of these starved dogs of which you can count the bones at one  hundred yards from them. No, a dog with just the skin and bones  cannot stand any work for the reason that he has no bottom.    Young pups should be fed at the very least three times daily, four  times is still better. Never give them more than what they can eat,  and in the meantime see that they just get enough so as to clean the  dish well at every meal and in no case should the pan containing the  food be left in the intervals with the puppies if they have not  cleaned it out as they will become disgusted with it and next time  refuse to feed. Keep everything clean and dry and always feed at the  same hour daily. It is much easier to rear a pair of pups than a  single one.    Before weaning the dew-claw should always be removed. These are of no  use but only serve to bother the dogs and hounds should always have  them cut off.    Worm medicine should always be given to all young dogs and kennels  should be lime washed at least three times a year and never allow  your dogs to sleep near the stove and then turn them out in the cold.  If you desire a lazy hound allow him to burn himself at the stove,  but if on the contrary you wish a lively dog, provide him with a good  dry kennel and if you keep several dogs see that each one has his own  stall. This has the advantage of preventing them from fighting and  from the risk of taking cold by lying out of the kennel.    When your dogs return from the hunt always examine their feet and  legs and if you find any sore spots attend to them at once. If the  dogs return wet to camp always allow them to dry near a stove before  turning them to their kennel which should be a good dry one.    If you desire your dogs to stand hard work day after day you must  look after them with as much care as a jockey attends to his horse.    The very moment you notice your dog is looking dull ascertain at once  what is the cause, and if you are of the opinion that it is a cold or  distemper, don't wait until you see his eyes and nose running, to  doctor him, but attend to him immediately.

The main and most important question in breeding race horses as well  as hounds is to get always the very best and to do this, one has to  be on the move and watch the hunting and staying quality as well as  the style of looking for trails, etc.; and a breeder should always be  ready to pay the price for a good sire or dam. And he should always  bear in mind that there is no more trouble or bother and that it does  not cost more to raise a pair of dogs from well known hunting stock  than from unknown stock but where it tells is when the dogs are of  age for training.

Nay! but it (the Koran) is a warning;    (And whoso is willing beareth it in mind)    Written on honoured pages,    Exalted, purified,    By the hands of Scribes, honoured, righteous.    Cursed be man! What hath made him unbelieving?    Of what thing did God create him?    Out of moist germs.3    He created him and fashioned him,    Then made him an easy passage from the womb,    Then causeth him to die and burieth him;    Then, when he pleaseth, will raise him again to life.    Aye! but man hath not yet fulfilled the bidding of his Lord.    Let man look at his food:    It was We who rained down the copious rains,    Then cleft the earth with clefts,    And caused the upgrowth of the grain,    And grapes and healing herbs,    And the olive and the palm,    And enclosed gardens thick with trees,    And fruits and herbage,    For the service of yourselves and of your cattle.

The Prophet spoke very  roughly to him at the time, but afterwards repented, and treated him ever  after with the greatest respect. So much so, that he twice made him Governor  of Medina.    2 That is, if he does not embrace Islam, and so become pure from sin, thou  wilt not be to blame; thou art simply charged with the delivery of a message  of warning.    3 Ex spermate.    4 Descriptions of the Day of Judgment now become very frequent.

This valley in  about the fourth century of our ra was a kind of sacred forest of 37 miles  in circumference, and called Haram a name applied to it as early as the time  of Pliny (vi. 32). It had the privilege of asylum, but it was not lawful to  inhabit it, or to carry on commerce within its limits, and its religious  ceremonies were a bond of union to several of the Bedouin tribes of the  Hejaz. The Koreisch had monopolised most of the offices and advantages of the  Haram in the time of Muhammad. See Sprenger's Life of Mohammad, pp. 7 20.
