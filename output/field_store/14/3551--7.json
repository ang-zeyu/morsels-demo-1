Here is the recipe for  a good sort: Cream half a cup of butter with a cup of sugar and add a  cup of sour milk in which three-quarters of a teaspoon of soda has been  dissolved, and two cups or a little more of flour, sifted with half a  teaspoon of cloves, half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of salt.

Lastly, add  half a teaspoon of soda. It is well to add the soda last, where a light  mixture is desired, as it begins to give off carbon dioxide, the gas  that makes the dough rise, as soon as it is moist and comes in contact  with the acid of the sour milk.           *       *       *       *       *    Graham bread made with sour milk in this way is delicious: Sift together  a cup and a half of graham flour and one of white.

At thirty minutes remove  cake and invert pan allowing to stand thus until cold.                                                  MISS ELIZA KENNEDY.    [Illustration]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],[0,"The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#11)"],[1,"out  of this circumstance was removed by the long pre-existing intercourse  of other Semites, of every grade of civilisation, with the Egyptians. In  Mesopotamia and elsewhere, as in Phenicia, Semitic people had attained  to a social organisation as advanced as that of the Egyptians; Semites  had conquered and occupied Lower Egypt for centuries. So extensively had  Semitic influences penetrated Egypt that the Egyptian language, during  the period of the nineteenth dynasty, is said by Brugsch to be as full  of Semitisms as German is of Gallicisms; while Semitic deities had  supplanted the Egyptian gods at Heliopolis and elsewhere. On the other  hand, the Semites, as far as Phenicia, were extensively influenced by  Egypt.    It is generally admitted [31] that Moses, Phinehas (and perhaps Aaron),  are names of Egyptian origin, and there is excellent authority for  the statement that the name _Abir,_ which the Israelites gave to their  golden calf, and which is also used to signify the strong, the heavenly,  and even God, [32] is simply the Egyptian Apis. Brugsch points out that  the god, Tum or Tom, who was the special object of worship in the city  of Pi-Tom, with which the Israelites were only too familiar, was called  Ankh and the \"great god,\" and had no image. Ankh means \"He who lives,\"  \"the living one,\" a name the resemblance of which to the \"I am that I  am\" of Exodus is unmistakable, whatever may be the value of the fact.  Every discussion of Israelitic ritual seeks and finds the explanation  of its details in the portable sacred chests, the altars, the priestly  dress, the breastplate, the incense, and the sacrifices depicted on the  monuments of Egypt. But it must be remembered that these signs of the  influence of Egypt upon Israel are not necessarily evidence that such  influence was exerted before the Exodus. It may have come much later,  through the close connection of the Israel of David and Solomon, first  with Phenicia and then with Egypt.    If we suppose Moses to have been a man of the stamp of Calvin, there is  no difficulty in conceiving that he may have constructed the substance  of the ten words, and even of the Book of the Covenant, which curiously  resembles parts of the Book of the Dead, from the foundation of Egyptian  ethics and theology which had filtered through to the Israelites  in general, or had been furnished specially to himself by his early  education; just as the great Genevese reformer built up a puritanic  social organisation on so much as remained of the ethics and theology of  the Roman Church, after he had trimmed them to his liking.    Thus, I repeat, I see no _a priori_ objection to the assumption that  Moses may have endeavoured to give his people a theologico-political  organisation based on the ten commandments (though certainly not quite  in their present form) and the Book of the Covenant, contained in our  present book of Exodus. But whether there is such evidence as amounts to  proof, or, I had better say, to probability, that even this much of  the Pentateuch owes its origin to Moses is another matter. The mythical  character of the accessories of the Sinaitic history is patent, and  it would take a good deal more evidence than is afforded by the bare  assertion of an unknown writer to justify the belief that the people who  \"saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the trumpet  and the mountain smoking\" (Exod. xx. 18); to whom Jahveh orders Moses to  say, \"Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.  Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver and gods of gold ye  shall not make unto you\" (_ibid._ 22, 23), should, less than six weeks  afterwards, have done the exact thing they were thus awfully forbidden  to do. Nor is the credibility of the story increased by the statement  that Aaron, the brother of Moses, the witness and fellow-worker of the  miracles before Pharaoh, was their leader and the artificer of the  idol. And yet, at the same time, Aaron was apparently so ignorant of  wrongdoing that he made proclamation, \"Tomorrow shall be a feast to  Jahveh,\" and the people proceeded to offer their burnt-offerings  and peace-offerings, as if everything in their proceedings must be  satisfactory to the Deity with whom they had just made a solemn covenant  to abolish image-worship. It seems to me that, on a survey of all the  facts of the case, only a very cautious and hypothetical judgment is  justifiable. It may be that Moses profited by the opportunities afforded  him of access to what was best in Egyptian society to become acquainted,  not only with its advanced ethical and legal code, but with the more or  less pantheistic unification of the Divine to which the speculations of  the Egyptian thinkers, like those of all polytheistic philosophers, from  Polynesia to Greece, tend; if indeed the theology of the period of the  nineteenth dynasty was not, as some Egyptologists think, a modification  of an earlier, more distinctly monotheistic doctrine of a long  antecedent age. It took only half a dozen centuries for the theology  of Paul to become the theology of Gregory the Great; and it is possible  that twenty centuries lay between the theology of the first worshippers  in the sanctuary of the Sphinx and that of the priests of Ramses Maimun.    It may be that the ten commandments and the Book of the Covenant are  based upon faithful traditions of the efforts of a great leader to  raise his followers to his own level. For myself, as a matter of pious  opinion, I like to think so; as I like to imagine that, between Moses  and Samuel, there may have been many a seer, many a herdsman such as him  of Tekoah, lonely amidst the hills of Ephraim and Judah, who cherished  and kept alive these traditions. In the present results of Biblical  criticism, however, I can discover no justification for the common  assumption that, between the time of Joshua and that of Rehoboam, the  Israelites were familiar with either the Deuteronomic or the Levitical  legislation; or that the theology of the Israelites, from the king who  sat on the throne to the lowest of his subjects, was in any important  respect different from that which might naturally be expected from their  previous history and the conditions of their existence. But there is  excellent evidence to the contrary effect. And, for my part, I see no  reason to doubt that, like the rest of the world, the Israelites had  passed through a period of mere ghost-worship, and had advanced through  Ancestor-worship and Fetishism and Totemism to the theological level at  which we find them in the books of Judges and Samuel.    All the more remarkable, therefore, is the extraordinary change which is  to be noted in the eighth century B.C. The student who is familiar with  the theology implied, or expressed, in the books of Judges, Samuel, and  the first book of Kings, finds himself in a new world of thought, in  the full tide of a great reformation, when he reads Joel, Amos, Hosea,  Isaiah, Micah, and Jeremiah.    The essence of this change is the reversal of the position which, in  primitive society, ethics holds in relation to theology. Originally,  that which men worship is a theological hypothesis, not a moral ideal.  The prophets, in substance, if not always in form preach the opposite  doctrine. They are constantly striving to free the moral ideal from the  stifling embrace of the current theology and its concomitant ritual.  Theirs was not an intellectual criticism, argued on strictly scientific  grounds; the image-worshippers and the believers in the efficacy of  sacrifices and ceremonies might logically have held their own against  anything the prophets have to say; it was an ethical criticism. From  the height of his moral intuition--that the whole duty of man is to do  justice and to love mercy and to bear himself as humbly as befits his  insignificance in face of the Infinite--the prophet simply laughs at the  idolaters of stocks and stones and the idolaters of ritual. Idols of the  first kind, in his experience, were inseparably united with the  practice of immorality, and they were to be ruthlessly destroyed. As for  sacrifices and ceremonies, whatever their intrinsic value might be, they  might be tolerated on condition of ceasing to be idols; they might even  be praiseworthy on condition of being made to subserve the worship of  the true Jahveh--the moral ideal.    If the realm of David had remained undivided, if the Assyrian and the  Chaldean and the Egyptian had left Israel to the ordinary course of  development of an Oriental kingdom, it is possible that the effects of  the reforming zeal of the prophets of the eighth and seventh centuries  might have been effaced by the growth, according to its inevitable  tendencies, of the theology which they combated. But the captivity made  the fortune of the ideas which it was the privilege of these men to  launch upon an endless career. With the abolition of the Temple-services  for more than half a century, the priest must have lost and the scribe  gained influence. The puritanism of a vigorous minority among the  Babylonian Jews rooted out polytheism from all its hiding-places in the  theology which they had inherited; they created the first consistent,  remorseless, naked monotheism, which, so far as history records,  appeared in the world (for Zoroastrism is practically ditheism, and  Buddhism any-theism or no-theism); and they inseparably united therewith  an ethical code, which, for its purity and for its efficiency as a bond  of social life, was and is, unsurpassed. So I think we must not judge  Ezra and Nehemiah and their followers too hardly, if they exemplified  the usual doom of poor humanity to escape from one error only to fall  into another; if they failed to free themselves as completely from the  idolatry of ritual as they had from that of images and dogmas; if they  cherished the new fetters of the Levitical"]]]
