To regulate the current a rheostat is necessary. When using  constant current the carbons should stand at an angle in order to  utilize to best advantage the stronger light of the positive (upper)  carbon. For spectroscopic projections the carbons of the lamp have to be  in vertical position.    Connected with the lamp is a triple condenser of 150 mm aperture. The  latter should be protected from the heat-rays by a large mica-plate  which is furnished with the apparatus.    Various devices permit very accurate adjustment of the lamp and  condenser. For example, two thumb-screws control the position of the  carbons of the lamp so that the luminous point may be readily brought  into the exact optical axis of the condenser. Again, the two inner  lenses of the condenser are moveable and are controlled by two knobs  conveniently situated as shown in the illustration.    By this adjustment of the lenses of the condenser it is possible to do  away with disturbing chromatic aberration. The rays of light leave the  condenser in moderate convergence.    For direct projection from the preparation the apparatus consists of the  optical bench upon which are mounted the various accessories in proper  succession (Fig. p. 88):    1. A large cooling cell, which is to be filled with water or alum  solution.    2. The bellows with tube. This is connected with the cooling cell by  means of a metal ring which slips over the end of the cell and is held  in place by a screw. The metal ring is attached to one end of the  bellows, while the other end carries a large tube.    3. The microscope condensers and diaphragm holder. A larger tube fits  over the tube of the bellows and carries on a revolving arm the cylinder  diaphragm and the two condensers. For low power objectives Nos. 1-3, the  cylinder diaphragm and the condenser of longer focus have to be used.  The latter at the same time serves as the objective for lantern slide  projection.    The other condenser is especially needed when high powers are employed  (Objectives 4 to 6). A small rack and pinion arrangement serves for the  adjustment of condenser and diaphragm.    4. The object stage and small cooler. The stage has connected with it a  second cooling cell on which the preparation rests. This arrangement  permits prolonged use of the condenser and the greatest intensity of  light without burning the most delicate specimens. The adjustment of the  object is accomplished by means of an arrangement which permits any  particular point to be brought accurately into the field.    [Illustration]    5. The objective carrier is provided with a nose-piece for three  objectives, with a broad projection tube, having an Iris diaphragm for  the purpose of narrowing the aperture, and with a narrow tube which  screws into the broad one, in case it is desired to use oculars in  making the projection. The adjustments of the objectives are  accomplished by rack and pinion and by micrometer screw.    In order to change readily from microscopic to lantern-slide projection,  the parts 4 and 5 have been provided with hinges, by means of which they  can be thrown to one side after loosening a lever (see illustration  below).    6. Wooden cover with cloth curtain which fits over the diaphragm  carrier, the stage and the objectives, to shut off any light which may  escape at the sides.    For the projection of large preparations of from 8-35 mm diameter our  photographic objectives of 24, 35, 42 and 64 mm focal distance are best  adapted (p. 86). In connection with these low powers the large tube only  should be used.    [Illustration]    With this projection apparatus the powers of microscope objectives till  number 6 may be well employed.    The picture, even when the highest powers are made use of, and the  screen is at a distance of twelve feet from the apparatus, is of  sufficient clearness and brightness to be available for demonstration to  a large audience.    For the projection of lantern slides or of large section of tissue  following parts of the apparatus are required: Lamp, condenser, cooler  and bellows are the same as in the above described apparatus.    The stage and objective carrier are swung to one side.    The special-projection lens of 300 mm focal distance is to be used.    A slide carrier slips into the frame of the bellows, which is  sufficiently large to accommodate lantern slides 9x10 and 9x12 cm in  size. The slide carrier has a stop at both ends which facilitates its  adjustment in the axis of the instrument, and is arranged for the  simultaneous reception of two slides, so that while one is being  projected it may be charged with a second which may then without delay  be pushed into the optical axis as the first is removed. In this way  series of pictures may be thrown on the screen without interruption.    When so arranged the projection can be made upon a screen 30 feet from  the apparatus, over the heads of an audience.

They are to be had in three different sizes. The larger two are slightly  different in construction from the third. The two former microtomes are  provided with an automatic feed attachement. A heavy knife-carrier  slides smoothly and rapidly on a horizontal track and is so arranged  that it may be manipulated by the hand of the operator alone or by a  wheel and chain device, which tends to assure a perfectly uniform stroke  of the knife.    The objectclamp is raised vertically by a micrometer screw. This motion  is accomplished by turning a large disc having teeth cut into its  periphery and a turn of one tooth being equal to an elevation of 0.0025  mm.    The automatic feed is arranged as follows: With each return of the  knife-carrier to the end of its track pressure is made upon an  adjustable lever which regulates the motion of the micrometer wheel.  This device may be so adjusted as to move the micrometer disc any number  of teeth from one to ten with each sweep of the knife.    Three different forms of clamps may be had for these microtomes, and  freezing apparatus as well as paraffin tables can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35937"],[0,"Are the Planets Inhabited?

The first of this series of facts concerning Mars about which there can be  no controversy or dispute relates to its size and mass. As the foregoing  Table shows, it comes between the Moon and the Earth in these respects.    The figures show at a glance that Mars ranks in its dimensions between the  Moon and the Earth, and that, on the whole, it is more like to the Moon  than it is to the Earth.    But in what way would this affect Mars as a suitable home for life? In  many ways; and amongst these the distribution of its atmosphere and the  sluggishness of its atmospheric circulation are not the least important.    It was mentioned in Chapter III that at a height of about three and a  third miles the barometer will stand at 15 inches, or half its mean height  at sea level, showing that one half the atmosphere has been passed  through. Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe, is under 3 miles in  height, so that it is not possible, in Europe, to climb to the level of  half-pressure; Mt. Everest, the highest mountain in the world, is not  quite six miles high, so that no part of the solid substance of our planet  reaches up to the level of the quarter pressure. On a very few occasions  daring aeronauts have soared into the empyrean higher than the summits of  even our loftiest mountains, but the excursion has been a dangerous one,  and they have with difficulty brought their life back from so rare and  cold, so inhospitable a region. When Gay-Lussac, in 1804, attained a  height of 23,000 feet above sea level, the thermometer, which on the  ground read 31 deg. C., sank to 9 deg. below zero, and the rare atmosphere was so  dry that paper crumpled up as if it had been placed near the fire, and his  pulse rose to 120 pulsations a minute instead of his normal 66. When Mr.  Glaisher and Mr. Coxwell made their celebrated ascent between 1 and 2  o'clock on the afternoon of September 5, 1861, they found that at a height  of 21,000 feet the temperature sank to -10.4 deg.; at 26,000 feet to -15.2 deg.;  and at 39,000 feet the temperature was down to -16.0 deg. C. At this height  the rarefaction of the air was so great and the cold so intense that Mr.  Glaisher fainted, and Mr. Coxwell's hands being rendered numb and useless  by the cold, he was only able to bring about their descent in time by  pulling the string of the safety valve with his teeth. Yet when they  attained this height they were far above all cloud or mist, and the Sun's  rays fell full upon them. The Sun's rays had all the force that they had  at the surface of the Earth, but in the rare atmosphere of seven miles  above the Earth, the radiation from every particle not in direct sunlight  was so great that while the right hand, exposed to the Sun, might burn,  the left hand, protected from his direct rays, might freeze.    But gravity at the surface of Mars is much feebler than at the surface of  the Earth, and in order to reach the level of half-pressure a Martian  mountaineer would have to climb, not three and a third miles, but eight  and three-quarter miles; that is to say, the distance to be ascended is in  the inverse proportion of the force of gravity at the surface of the  planet. The atmosphere of Mars, therefore, is much deeper than that of the  Earth, and one great cause of precipitation here is much weakened there. A  current of air heavily laden with moisture, if it encounters a range of  mountains, is forced upwards, and consequently expands, owing to the  diminished pressure. The expansion brings about a cooling, and from both  causes the atmosphere is unable to retain as much water-vapour as it  carried before. On Mars, the same relative expansion and cooling would  only follow if the ascent were nearly three times as great, and the feeble  force of gravity has its effect in another way; for just as a weight on  Mars will only fall six feet in the first second as against sixteen on  the Earth, so a dense and heavy column of air will fall with proportionate  slowness and a light column ascend in the same languid manner. An  ascending current on Mars would therefore take 1/0.38 x 1/0.38 = 1/0.145,  or seven times as long to attain the same relative expansion as on the  Earth.    The winds of Mars are therefore sluggish, and precipitation is slight. So  far at least it resembles      \"The island valley of Avilion;    Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,    Nor ever wind blows loudly;\"    and R. A. Proctor, acute and accurate writer on planetary physics as he  was, fell into a mistake when he referred to Mars as being  \"hurricane-swept.\" There are no hurricanes on Mars; its fiercest winds can  never exceed in violence what a sailor would call a \"capful.\"    This holds good for Mars, but it also holds good for every planet where  the force of gravity at the surface is relatively feeble. The greater the  force of gravity the more active the atmospheric circulation, and more  violent its disturbances; the feebler the action of gravity the more  languid the circulation, and the slighter the disturbances.
