Fig. 24 gives a picture of it.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--The Pleiades.]    Without going thus far, and penetrating into telescopic depths, my  readers can get some notion of these star-clusters with the help of a  small telescope or opera-glasses, or even with the unaided eye, by  looking at the beautiful group of the Pleiades, already familiar to us  on another page, and using it as a test of vision. The little map  subjoined (Fig. 25) will be an assistance in recognizing them, and in  estimating their magnitudes, which are in the following order:              Alcyone    3.0.            Electra    4.5.            Atlas      4.6.            Maia       5.0.            Merope     5.5.            Taygeta    5.8.            Pleione    6.3.            Celaeno     6.5.            Asterope   6.8.    Good eyes distinguish the first six, sharp sight detects the three  others.    In the times of the ancient Greeks, seven were accounted of equal  brilliancy, and the poets related that the seventh star had fled at the  time of the Trojan War. Ovid adds that she was mortified at not being  embraced by a god, as were her six sisters. It is probable that only the  best sight could then distinguish Pleione, as in our own day. The  angular distance from Atlas to Pleione is 5'.    The length of this republic, from Atlas and Pleione to Celaeno, is 4'/23\"  of time, or 1 deg. 6' of arc; the breadth, from Merope to Asterope, is  36'.[8]    In the quadrilateral, the length from Alcyone to Electra is 36', and the  breadth from Merope to Maia 25'. To us it appears as though, if the Full  Moon were placed in front of this group of nine stars, she would cover  it entirely, for to the naked eye she appears much larger than all the  Pleiades together. But this is not so. She only measures 31', less than  half the distance from Atlas to Celaeno; she is hardly broader than the  distance from Alcyone to Atlas, and could pass between Merope and  Taygeta without touching either of these stars. This is a perennial and  very curious optical illusion. When the Moon passes in front of the  Pleiades, and occults them successively, it is hard to believe one's  eyes. The fact occurred, _e.g._, on July 23, 1897, during a fine  occultation observed at the author's laboratory of Juvisy (Fig. 26).    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Occultation of the Pleiades by the Moon.]    Photography here discovers to us, not 6, 9, 12, 15, or 20 stars, but  hundreds and millions.    These are the most brilliant flowers of the celestial garden.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Stellar dial of the double star [gamma] of the  Virgin.]    We, alas, can but glance at them rapidly. In contemplating them we are  transported into immensities both of space and time, for the stellar  periods measured by these distant universes often overpower in their  magnitude the rapid years in which our terrestrial days are estimated.  For instance, one of the double stars we spoke of above, [gamma] of the  Virgin, sees its two components, translucent diamonds, revolve around  their common center of gravity, in one hundred and eighty years. How  many events took place in France, let us say, in a single year of this  star!--The Regency, Louis XV, Louis XVI, the Revolution, Napoleon, Louis  XVIII, Louis Philippe, the Second Republic, Napoleon III, the  Franco-German War, the Third Republic.... What revolutions here, during  a single year of this radiant pair! (Fig. 27.)    But the pageant of the Heavens is too vast, too overwhelming. We must  end our survey.    Our Milky Way, with its millions of stars, represents for us only a  portion of the Creation. The illimitable abysses of Infinitude are  peopled by other universes as vast, as imposing, as our own, which are  renewed in all directions through the depths of Space to endless  distance. Where is our little Earth? Where our Solar System? We are fain  to fold our wings, and return from the Immense and Infinite to our  floating island.          CHAPTER IV    OUR STAR THE SUN      In the incessant agitation of daily life in which we are involved by the  thousand superfluous wants of modern \"civilization,\" one is prone to  assume that existence is complete only when it reckons to the good an  incalculable number of petty incidents, each more insignificant than the  last. Why lose time in thinking or dreaming? We must live at fever heat,  must agitate, and be infatuated for inanities, must create imaginary  desires and torments.    The thoughtful mind, prone to contemplation and admiration of the  beauties of Nature, is ill at ease in this perpetual vortex that  swallows everything--satisfaction, in a life that one has not time to  relish; love of the beautiful, that one views with indifference; it is a  whirlpool that perpetually hides Truth from us, forgotten forever at the  bottom of her well.    And why are our lives thus absorbed in merely material interests? To  satisfy our pride and vanity! To make ourselves slaves to chimeras! If  the Moon were inhabited, and if her denizens could see us plainly  enough to note and analyze the details of human existence on the surface  of our planet, it would be curious and perhaps a little humiliating for  us, to see their statistics. What! we should say, is this the sum of our  lives? Is it for this that we struggle, and suffer, and die? Truly it is  futile to give ourselves such trouble.    And yet the remedy is simple, within the power of every one; but one  does not think of it just because it is too easy, although it has the  immense advantage of lifting us out of the miseries of this weary world  toward the inexpressible happiness that must always awaken in us with  the knowledge of the Truth: we need only open our eyes to see, and to  look out. Only--one hardly ever thinks of it, and it is easier to let  one's self be blinded by the illusion and false glamor of appearances.    Think what it would be to consecrate an hour each day to voluntary  participation in the harmonious Choir of Nature, to raise one's eyes  toward the Heavens, to share the lessons taught by the Pageant of the  Universe! But, no: there is no time, no time for the intellectual life,  no time to become attached to real interests, no time to pursue them.    Among the objects marshaled for us in the immense spectacle of Nature,  nothing without exception has struck the admiration and attention of  man as much as the Sun, the God of Light, the fecundating orb, without  which our planet and its life would never have issued from nonentity,  _the visible image of the invisible god_, as said Cicero, and the poets  of antiquity. And yet how many beyond the circle of those likely to read  these pages know that this Sun is a star in the Milky Way, and that  every star is a sun? How many take any account of the reality and  grandeur of the Universe? Inquire, and you will find that the number of  people who have any notion, however rudimentary, of its construction, is  singularly restricted. Humanity is content to vegetate, much after the  fashion of a race of moles.    Henceforward, you will know that you are living in the rays of a star,  which, from its proximity, we term a sun. To the inhabitants of other  systems of worlds, our splendid Sun is only a more or less brilliant,  luminous point, according as the spot from which it is observed is  nearer or farther off. But to us its \"terrestrial\" importance renders it  particularly precious; we forget all the sister stars on its account,  and even the most ignorant hail it with enthusiasm without exactly  knowing what its role in the universe may be, simply because they feel  that they depend on it, and that without it life would become extinct on  this globe. Yes, it is the beneficent rays of the Sun that shed upon  our Earth the floods of light and heat to which Life owes its existence  and its perpetual propagation.    Hail, vast Sun! a little star in Infinitude, but for us a colossal and  portentous luminary. Hail, divine Benefactor! How should we not adore,  when we owe him the glow of the warm and cheery days of summer, the  gentle caresses by which his rays touch the undulating ears, and gild  them with the touch? The Sun sustains our globe in Space, and keeps it  within his rays by the mysteriously powerful and delicate cords of  attraction. It is the Sun that we inhale from the embalmed corollas of  the flowers that uplift their gracious heads toward his light, and  reflect his splendors back to us. It is the Sun that sparkles in the  foam of the merry wine; that charms our gaze in those first days of  spring, when the home of the human race is adorned with all the charms  of verdant and flowering youth. Everywhere we find the Sun; everywhere  we recognize his work, extending from the infinitely great to the  infinitely little. We bow to his might, and admire his power. When in  the sad winter day he disappears behind the snowy eaves, we think his  fiery globe will never rise to mitigate the short December days which  are alleviated with his languid beams.    April restores him to superb majesty, and our hearts are filled with  hope in the illumination of those beauteous, sunny hours.           *       *       *       *       *    Our celestial journey carried us far indeed from our own Solar System.  Guided by the penetrating eye of the telescope, we reached such distant  creations that we lost sight of our cherished luminary.    But we remember that he burns yonder, in the midst of the pale cosmic  cloud we term the Milky Way. Let us approach him, now that we have  visited the Isles of Light in the Celestial Ocean; let us traverse the  vast plains strewn with the burning gold of the Suns of the Infinite.    We embark upon a ray of light, and glide rapidly to the portals of our  Universe. Soon we perceive a tiny speck, scintillating feebly in the  depths of Space, and recognize it as our own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#11)"],[1,"go.    SEPTEMBER 10.    Oh, what a night, Wilhelm! I can henceforth bear anything. I shall never  see her again. Oh, why cannot I fall on your neck, and, with floods of  tears and raptures, give utterance to all the passions which distract my  heart! Here I sit gasping for breath, and struggling to compose myself.  I wait for day, and at sunrise the horses are to be at the door.    And she is sleeping calmly, little suspecting that she has seen me for  the last time. I am free. I have had the courage, in an interview of  two hours' duration, not to betray my intention. And O Wilhelm, what a  conversation it was!    Albert had promised to come to Charlotte in the garden immediately  after supper. I was upon the terrace under the tall chestnut trees, and  watched the setting sun. I saw him sink for the last time beneath this  delightful valley and silent stream. I had often visited the same  spot with Charlotte, and witnessed that glorious sight; and now--I was  walking up and down the very avenue which was so dear to me. A secret  sympathy had frequently drawn me thither before I knew Charlotte; and  we were delighted when, in our early acquaintance, we discovered that we  each loved the same spot, which is indeed as romantic as any that ever  captivated the fancy of an artist.    From beneath the chestnut trees, there is an extensive view. But I  remember that I have mentioned all this in a former letter, and have  described the tall mass of beech trees at the end, and how the avenue  grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them, till it ends  in a gloomy recess, which has all the charm of a mysterious solitude. I  still remember the strange feeling of melancholy which came over me the  first time I entered that dark retreat, at bright midday. I felt some  secret foreboding that it would, one day, be to me the scene of some  happiness or misery.    I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts of  going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace. I ran to  meet them. I trembled as I took her hand, and kissed it. As we reached  the top of the terrace, the moon rose from behind the wooded hill. We  conversed on many subjects, and, without perceiving it, approached the  gloomy recess. Charlotte entered, and sat down. Albert seated himself  beside her. I did the same, but my agitation did not suffer me to remain  long seated. I got up, and stood before her, then walked backward and  forward, and sat down again. I was restless and miserable. Charlotte  drew our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw  a silver hue over the terrace in front of us, beyond the beech trees.  It was a glorious sight, and was rendered more striking by the darkness  which surrounded the spot where we were. We remained for some time  silent, when Charlotte observed, \"Whenever I walk by moonlight, it  brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departed friends, and I  am filled with thoughts of death and futurity. We shall live again,  Werther!\" she continued, with a firm but feeling voice; \"but shall we  know one another again what do you think? what do you say?\"    \"Charlotte,\" I said, as I took her hand in mine, and my eyes filled with  tears, \"we shall see each other again--here and hereafter we shall meet  again.\" I could say no more. Why, Wilhelm, should she put this question  to me, just at the moment when the fear of our cruel separation filled  my heart?    \"And oh! do those departed ones know how we are employed here? do they  know when we are well and happy? do they know when we recall their  memories with the fondest love? In the silent hour of evening the shade  of my mother hovers around me; when seated in the midst of my children,  I see them assembled near me, as they used to assemble near her; and  then I raise my anxious eyes to heaven, and wish she could look down  upon us, and witness how I fulfil the promise I made to her in her last  moments, to be a mother to her children. With what emotion do I then  exclaim, 'Pardon, dearest of mothers, pardon me, if I do not adequately  supply your place! Alas! I do my utmost. They are clothed and fed; and,  still better, they are loved and educated. Could you but see, sweet  saint! the peace and harmony that dwells amongst us, you would glorify  God with the warmest feelings of gratitude, to whom, in your last hour,  you addressed such fervent prayers for our happiness.'\" Thus did she  express herself; but O Wilhelm! who can do justice to her language? how  can cold and passionless words convey the heavenly expressions of the  spirit? Albert interrupted her gently. \"This affects you too deeply,  my dear Charlotte. I know your soul dwells on such recollections with  intense delight; but I implore--\" \"O Albert!\" she continued, \"I am sure  you do not forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the little  round table, when papa was absent, and the little ones had retired. You  often had a good book with you, but seldom read it; the conversation of  that noble being was preferable to everything,--that beautiful,  bright, gentle, and yet ever-toiling woman. God alone knows how I have  supplicated with tears on my nightly couch, that I might be like her.\"    I threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it with  a thousand tears. \"Charlotte!\" I exclaimed, \"God's blessing and your  mother's spirit are upon you.\" \"Oh! that you had known her,\" she said,  with a warm pressure of the hand. \"She was worthy of being known to  you.\" I thought I should have fainted: never had I received praise so  flattering. She continued, \"And yet she was doomed to die in the flower  of her youth, when her youngest child was scarcely six months old. Her  illness was but short, but she was calm and resigned; and it was only  for her children, especially the youngest, that she felt unhappy. When  her end drew nigh, she bade me bring them to her. I obeyed. The younger  ones knew nothing of their approaching loss, while the elder ones were  quite overcome with grief. They stood around the bed; and she raised  her feeble hands to heaven, and prayed over them; then, kissing them in  turn, she dismissed them, and said to me, 'Be you a mother to them.'  I gave her my hand. 'You are promising much, my child,' she said: 'a  mother's fondness and a mother's care! I have often witnessed, by your  tears of gratitude, that you know what is a mother's tenderness: show it  to your brothers and sisters, and be dutiful and faithful to your  father as a wife; you will be his comfort.' She inquired for him. He  had retired to conceal his intolerable anguish,--he was heartbroken,  'Albert, you were in the room.' She heard some one moving: she inquired  who it was, and desired you to approach. She surveyed us both with a  look of composure and satisfaction, expressive of her conviction that  we should be happy,--happy with one another.\" Albert fell upon her neck,  and kissed her, and exclaimed, \"We are so, and we shall be so!\" Even  Albert, generally so tranquil, had quite lost his composure; and I was  excited beyond expression.    \"And such a being,\" She continued, \"was to leave us, Werther! Great God,  must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this world? Nobody  felt this more acutely than the children: they cried and lamented for  a long time afterward, complaining that men had carried away their dear  mamma.\"    Charlotte rose. It aroused me; but I continued sitting, and held her  hand. \"Let us go,\" she said: \"it grows late.\" She attempted to withdraw  her hand: I held it still. \"We shall see each other again,\" I exclaimed:  \"we shall recognise each other under every possible change! I am going,\"  I continued, \"going willingly; but, should I say for ever, perhaps I may  not keep my word. Adieu, Charlotte; adieu, Albert. We shall meet again.\"  \"Yes: tomorrow, I think,\" she answered with a smile. Tomorrow! how I  felt the word! Ah! she little thought, when she drew her hand away from  mine. They walked down the avenue. I stood gazing after them in the  moonlight. I threw myself upon the ground, and wept: I then sprang  up, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of the  linden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate. I  stretched out my arms, and she vanished.          BOOK II.    OCTOBER 20.    We arrived here yesterday. The ambassador is indisposed, and will not  go out for some days. If he were less peevish and morose, all would  be well. I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined me to severe  trials; but courage! a light heart may bear anything. A light heart!  I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen. A little more  lightheartedness would render me the happiest being under the sun.  But must I despair of my talents and faculties, whilst others of far  inferior abilities parade before me with the utmost self-satisfaction?  Gracious Providence, to whom I owe all my powers, why didst thou not  withhold some of those blessings I possess, and substitute in their  place a feeling of self-confidence and contentment?    But patience! all will yet be well; for I assure you, my dear friend,  you were right: since I have been obliged to associate continually with  other people, and observe what they do, and how they employ themselves,  I have become far better satisfied with myself. For we are so  constituted by nature, that we are ever prone to compare ourselves with  others; and our happiness or misery depends very much on the objects  and persons around us. On this account, nothing is more dangerous than  solitude: there our imagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new  flight on the wings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom  we seem the most inferior. All things appear greater than they really  are, and all seem superior to us. This operation of the mind is quite  natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, and fancy we  perceive in others the qualities"]]]
