We must not build her  on the sea-coast, or before the time when we need her she may be  destroyed by the Danes. We will build her on the Parrot. The water is  deep enough far up from the sea to float her when empty, and if we  choose some spot where the river runs among woods we might hide her so  that she may to the last escape the attention of the Danes.    \"We must get some men crafty in ship-building from one of the ports,  sending down a body of our own serfs to do the rough work. We will go  to Exeter first and there choose us the craftsman most skilled in  building ships, and will take council with him as to the best form and  size. She must be good to sail and yet able to row fast with a strong  crew, and she must have room to house a goodly number of rowing and  fighting men. You, Edmund, might, before we start, consult King Alfred.  He must have seen at Rome and other ports on the Mediterranean the  ships in use there, which are doubtless far in advance of our own. For  we know from the Holy Bible that a thousand years ago St. Paul made  long voyages in ships, and doubtless they have learned much since those  days.\"    Edmund thought the idea a good one, and asked the king to make him a  drawing of the vessels in use in the Mediterranean. This King Alfred  readily did, and Egbert and Edmund then journeyed to Exeter, where  finding out the man most noted for his skill in building ships, they  told him the object they had in view, and showed him the drawings the  king had made. There were two of them, the one a long galley rowed with  double banks of oars, the other a heavy trading ship.    \"This would be useless to you,\" the shipwright said, laying the second  drawing aside. \"It would not be fast enough either to overtake or to  fly. The other galley would, methinks, suit you well. I have seen a  drawing of such a ship before. It is a war galley such as is used by  the Genoese in their fights against the African pirates. They are fast  and roomy, and have plenty of accommodation for the crews. One of them  well manned and handled should be a match for six at least of the  Danish galleys, which are much lower in the water and smaller in all  ways. But it will cost a good deal of money to build such a ship.\"    \"I will devote all the revenues of my land to it until it is finished,\"  Edmund said. \"I will place a hundred serfs at your service, and will  leave it to you to hire as many craftsmen as may be needed. I intend to  build her in a quiet place in a deep wood on the river Parrot, so that  she may escape the eyes of the Danes.\"    \"I shall require seasoned timber,\" the shipwright urged.    \"That will I buy,\" Edmund replied, \"as you shall direct, and can have  it brought up the river to the spot.\"    \"Being so large and heavy,\" the shipwright said, \"she will be difficult  to launch. Methinks it were best to dig a hole or dock at some little  distance from the river; then when she is finished a way can be cut to  the river wide enough for her to pass out. When the water is turned in  it will float her up level to the surface, and as she will not draw  more than two feet of water the cut need not be more than three feet  deep.\"    \"That will be the best plan by far,\" Edmund agreed, \"for you can make  the hole so deep that you can build her entirely below the level of the  ground. Then we can, if needs be, fill up the hole altogether with  bushes, and cover her up, so that she would not be seen by a Danish  galley rowing up the river, or even by any of the enemy who might enter  the wood, unless they made special search for her; and there she could  lie until I chose to embark.\"    The shipwright at once set to work to draw out his plans, and a week  later sent to Edmund a messenger with an account of the quantity and  size of wood he should require. This was purchased at once. Edmund and  Egbert with their serfs journeyed to the spot they had chosen, and were  met there by the shipwright, who brought with him twenty craftsmen from  Exeter. The wood was brought up the river, and while the craftsmen  began to cut it up into fitting sizes, the serfs applied themselves to  dig the deep dock in which the vessel was to be built.          CHAPTER V: A DISCIPLINED BAND      The construction of the ship went on steadily. King Alfred, who was  himself building several war vessels of ordinary size, took great  interest in Edmund's craft and paid several visits to it while it was  in progress.    \"It will be a fine ship,\" he said one day as the vessel was approaching  completion, \"and much larger than any in these seas. It reminds me,  Edmund, not indeed in size or shape, but in its purpose, of the ark  which Noah built before the deluge which covered the whole earth. He  built it, as you know, to escape with his family from destruction. You,  too, are building against the time when the deluge of Danish invasion  will sweep over this land, and I trust that your success will equal  that of the patriarch.\"    \"I shall be better off than Noah was,\" Edmund said, \"for he had nothing  to do, save to shut up his windows and wait till the floods abated,  while I shall go out and seek my enemies on the sea.\"    The respite purchased by the king from the Danes was but a short one.  In the autumn of 875 their bands were again swarming around the borders  of Wessex, and constant irruptions took place. Edmund received a  summons to gather his tenants, but he found that these no longer  replied willingly to the call. Several of his chief men met him and  represented to him the general feeling which prevailed.    \"The men say,\" their spokesman explained, \"that it is useless to fight  against the Danes. In 872 there were ten pitched battles, and vast  numbers of the Danes were slain, and vast numbers also of Saxons. The  Danes are already far more numerous than before, for fresh hordes  continue to arrive on the shores, and more than fill up the places of  those who are killed; but the places of the Saxons are empty, and our  fighting force is far smaller than it was last year. If we again go out  and again fight many battles, even if we are victorious, which we can  hardly hope to be, the same thing will happen. Many thousands will be  slain, and the following year we shall in vain try to put an army in  the field which can match that of the Danes, who will again have filled  up their ranks, and be as numerous as ever. So long as we continue to  fight, so long the Danes will slay, burn, and destroy wheresoever they  march, until there will remain of us but a few fugitives hidden in the  woods. We should be far better off did we cease to resist, and the  Danes become our masters, as they have become the masters of  Northumbria, Mercia, and Anglia.    \"There, it is true, they have plundered the churches and thanes' houses  and have stolen all that is worth carrying away; but when they have  taken all that there is to take they leave the people alone, and  unmolested, to till the ground and to gain their livelihood. They do  not slay for the pleasure of slaying, and grievous as is the condition  of the Angles they and their wives and children are free from massacre  and are allowed to gain their livings. The West Saxons have showed that  they are no cowards; they have defeated the Northmen over and over  again when far outnumbering them. It is no dishonour to yield now when  all the rest of England has yielded, and when further fighting will  only bring ruin upon ourselves, our wives, and children.\"    Edmund could find no reply to this argument. He knew that even the king  despaired of ultimately resisting the Danish invasion, and after  listening to all that the thanes had to say he retired with Egbert  apart.    \"What say you, Egbert? There is reason in the arguments that they use.  You and I have neither wives nor children, and we risk only our own  lives; but I can well understand that those who have so much to lose  are chary of further effort. What say you?\"    \"I do not think it will be fair to press them further,\" Egbert  answered; \"but methinks that we might raise a band consisting of all  the youths and unmarried men in the earldom. These we might train  carefully and keep always together, seeing that the lands will still be  cultivated and all able to pay their assessment, and may even add to  it, since you exempt them from service. Such a band we could train and  practise until we could rely upon them to defeat a far larger force of  the enemy, and they would be available for our crew when we take to the  ship.\"    \"I think the idea is a very good one, Egbert; we will propose it to the  thanes.\" The proposition was accordingly made that all married men  should be exempt from service, but that the youths above the age of  sixteen and the unmarried men should be formed into a band and kept  permanently under arms. Landowners who lost the services of sons or  freemen working for them should pay the same assessment only as before,  but those who did not contribute men to the levy should pay an  additional assessment. Edmund said he would pay the men composing the  band the same wages they would earn in the field, and would undertake  all their expenses. \"So long as the king continues the struggle,\" he  said, \"it is our duty to aid him, nor can we escape from the dangers  and perils of invasion. Should the Danes come near us all must perforce  fight, but so long as they continue at a distance things can go on here  as if we had peace in the land.\"    The proposal was, after some discussion, agreed to, and the news caused  gladness and contentment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#11)"],[1,"financial investment, and he may succeed, indeed, has often  succeeded, certainly to the extent of getting back his outlay with  interest, and sometimes making a handsome profit. But this needs  experience. Just as one must build at least two houses before he can  exactly suit himself, so he must collect two libraries before he can get  one that will prove a fair investment in the vulgar sense of trade.    I dare say that one will frequently pay more for a fine microscope or  telescope than he can ever obtain for it if he desires or is pressed to  sell it, but who would or should stop to think of that? The power of  prying into the mysteries of the earth and the wonders of the heavens  should raise one's thoughts above such petty considerations. So it should  be in buying that which enables one to converse with Shakespeare or Milton  or scan the works of Raphael or Durer. When the pioneer on the western  plains purchases an expensive rifle he does not inquire whether he can  sell it for what it costs; his purpose is to defend his house against  Indians and other wild beasts. So the true book-buyer buys books to fight  weariness, disgust, sorrow and despair; to loose himself from the world  and forget time and all its limitations and besetments. In this view they  never cost too much. And so when asked if book-collecting pays, I retort  by asking, does piety pay? \"Honesty is the best policy\" is the meanest of  maxims. Honesty ought to be a principle and not a policy; and  book-collecting ought to be a means of education, refinement and  enjoyment, and not a mode of financial investment.          XIV.    THE BOOK-WORM'S FAULTS.      This is not a case of \"Snakes in Iceland,\" for the Book-Worm has faults.  One of his faults is his proneness to regard books as mere merchandise and  not as vehicles of intellectual profit, that is to say, to be read. Too  many collectors buy books simply for their rarity and with too little  regard to the value of their contents. The Circassian slave-dealer does  not care whether his girls can talk sense or not, and too many men buy  books with a similar disregard to their capacity for instructing or  entertaining. It seems to me that a man who buys books which he does not  read, and especially such as he cannot read, merely on account of their  value as merchandise, degrades the noble passion of bibliomania to the  level of a trade. When I go through such a library I think of what  Christ said to the traders in the Temple. Another fault is his lack of  independence and his tendency to imitate the recognized leaders. He is too  prone to buy certain books simply because another has them, and thus even  rare collections are apt to fall into a tiresome routine. The collector  who has a hobby and independence to ride it is admirable. Let him addict  himself to some particular subject or era or \"ana,\" and try to exhaust it,  and before he is conscious he will have accumulated a collection precious  for its very singularity. It strikes me that the best example of this  idea that I have ever heard of is the attempt, in which two collectors in  this country are engaged, to acquire the first or at least one specimen of  every one of the five hundred fifteenth century printers. If this should  ever succeed, the great libraries of all the world would be eager for it,  and the undertaking is sufficiently arduous to last a lifetime.    Sometimes out of this fault, sometimes independently of it, arises the  fault by which book collecting degenerates into mere rivalry--the vulgar  desire of display and ambition for a larger or rarer or costlier  accumulation than one's neighbor has. The determination not to be  outdone does not lend dignity or worth to the pursuit which would  otherwise be commendable. During the late civil war in this country the  chaplain of a regiment informed his colonel, who was not a godly person,  that there was a hopeful revival of religion going on in a neighboring and  rival regiment, and that forty men had been converted and baptized.  \"Dashed if I will submit to that,\" said the swearing colonel: \"Adjutant,  detail fifty men for baptism instantly!\" So Mr. Roe, hearing that Mr. Doe  has acquired a Caxton or other rarity of a certain height, and absolutely  flawless except that the corners of the last leaf have been skillfully  mended and that six leaves are slightly foxed, cannot rest night or day  for envy, but is like the troubled sea until he can find a copy a  sixteenth of an inch taller, the corners of whose leaves are in their  pristine integrity, and over whose brilliant surface the smudge of the fox  has not been cast, and then how high is his exaltation! Not that he cares  anything for the book intrinsically, but he glories in having beaten  Doe. Now if any speaks to him of Doe's remarkable copy, he can draw out  his own and create a surprise in the bosom of Doe's adherent. The laurels  of Miltiades no longer deprive him of rest. He has overcome in this  trivial and childish strife concerning size and condition, and he holds  the champion's belt for the present. He not only feels big himself but he  has succeeded in making Doe feel small, which is still better. I don't  know whether there will be any book-collecting in Mr. Bellamy's Utopia,  but if there is, it will not be disfigured by such meanness, but  collectors will go about striving to induce others to accept their  superior copies and everything will be as lovely as in Heine's heaven,  where geese fly around ready cooked, and if one treads on your corn it  conveys a sensation of exquisite delight.    It has been several times remarked by moralists that human nature is  selfish. One of course does not expect another to relinquish to him his  place in a \"queue\" at a box-office or his turn at a barber's shop, but in  the noble and elegant pursuit of book-collecting it would be well to  emulate the politeness of the French at Fontenoy, and hat in hand offer  our antagonist the first shot. But I believe the only place where the  Book-Worm ever does that is the auction room.          I no sooner come into the library, but I bolt the door to me,      excluding lust, ambition, avarice, and all such vices, whose nurse is      idleness, the mother of ignorance, and melancholy herself, and in the      very lap of eternity, among so many divine souls, I take my seat with      so lofty a spirit and sweet content, that I pity all our great ones      and rich men that know not this happiness.        --Heinsius.      The modern Book-Worm is not the simple and absent-minded creature who went  by this name a century ago or more. He is no mere antiquarian, Dryasdust  or Dominie Sampson, but he is a sharp merchant, or a relentless broker, or  a professional railroad wrecker, or a keen lawyer, or a busy physician, or  a great manufacturer--a wide awake man of affairs, quite devoid of the  conventional innocency and credulity which formerly made the name of  Book-Worm suggestive of a necessity for a guardian or a committee in  lunacy. No longer does he inquire, as Becatello inquired of Alphonso,  King of Naples, which had done the better--Poggius, who sold a Livy,  fairly writ in his own hand, to buy a country home near Florence, or he,  who to buy a Livy had sold a piece of land? No longer is the scale turned  in the negotiation of a treaty between princes by the weight of a rare  book, as when Cosimo dei Medici persuaded King Alphonso of Naples to a  peace by sending him a codex of Livy. No longer does the Book-Worm sit in  his modest book-room, absorbed in his adored volumes, heedless of the  waning lamp and the setting star, of hunger and thirst, unmindful of the  scent of the clover wafted in at the window, deaf to the hum of the bees  and the low of the kine, blind to the glow of sunsets and the soft contour  of the blue hills, and the billowy swaying of the wheat field before the  gentle breath of the south. No longer can it be said that      THE BOOK-WORM DOES NOT CARE FOR NATURE.      I feel no need of nature's flowers--      Of flowers of rhetoric I have store;    I do not miss the balmy showers--      When books are dry I o'er them pore.      Why should I sit upon a stile      And cause my aged bones to ache,    When I can all the hours beguile      With any style that I would take?      Why should I haunt a purling stream,      Or fish in miasmatic brook?    O'er Euclid's angles I can dream,      And recreation find in Hook.      Why should I jolt upon a horse      And after wretched vermin roam,    When I can choose an easier course      With Fox and Hare and Hunt at home?      Why should I scratch my precious skin      By crawling through a hawthorne hedge,    When Hawthorne, raking up my sin,      Stands tempting on the nearest ledge?      No need that I should take the trouble      To go abroad to walk or ride,    For I can sit at home and double      Quite up with pain from Akenside.    The modern Book-Worm deals in sums of six figures; he keeps an agent \"on  the other side;\" he cables his demands and his decisions; his name  flutters the dovecotes in the auction-room; to him is proffered the first  chance at a rarity worth a King's ransom; too busy to potter in person  with such a trifle as the purchase of a Mazarine Bible, he hires others to  do the hunting and he merely receives the game; the tiger skin and the  elephant's tusk are laid at his feet to order, but he misses all the joy  and ardor of the hunt. How different is all this from Sir Thomas  Urquhart's account of his own library, of which he says: \"There were not  three works therein which were not of mine own purchase, and all of them  together, in the order wherein I had ranked them, compiled like to a  complete nosegay of flowers, which in my travels I had gathered out of the  gardens of sixteen several kingdoms.\"    Another fault of the Book-Worm is the affectation of collecting books on  subjects in which he takes no practical"]]]
