These objectors  belong partly, I think, in Jefferson's category of \"nervous  persons\"--\"anti-republicans,\" as he goes on to define them--\"whose  languid fibres have more analogy with a passive than an active state of  things.\" Other objectors to the phrase \"all men are created equal\" have  had an obvious personal or political motive for refusing assent to  the proposition. But \"no intelligent man,\" says one of Jefferson's  biographers, \"has ever misconstrued it [the Declaration] except  intentionally.\"    Nobody would claim today that Thomas Jefferson's statement of the  sentiments and reasons for the independence of the thirteen British  colonies in 1776 was an adequate handbook of political wisdom, fit for  all the exigencies of contemporary American democracy. It is not that.  It is simply, in Lincoln's phrase, one of \"the standard maxims of free  society\" which no democracy can safely disregard.    Jefferson's long life, so varied, so flexible, so responsive to the  touch of popular forces, illustrates the process by which the Virginia  mind of 1743 became the nationalized, unionized mind of 1826. It is  needless here to dwell upon the traits of his personal character: his  sweetness of spirit, his stout-heartedness in disaster, his scorn of  money, his love for the intellectual life. \"I have no ambition to govern  men,\" he wrote to Edward Rutledge. He was far happier talking about  Greek and Anglo-Saxon with Daniel Webster before the fire-place  of Monticello than he ever was in the presidential chair. His  correspondence was enormous. His writings fill twenty volumes. In his  theories of education he was fifty years ahead of his time; in his  absolute trust in humanity he was generations ahead of it. \"I am not  one of those who fear the people,\" he declared proudly. It is because of  this touching faith, this invincible and matchless ardor, that Jefferson  is today remembered. He foreshadowed Lincoln. His belief in the  inarticulate common people is rewarded by their obstinate fidelity to  his name as a type and symbol. \"I know of no safe depository of the  ultimate powers of society but the people themselves,\" wrote Jefferson,  and with the people themselves is the depository of his fame.        CHAPTER V. THE KNICKERBOCKER GROUP    The Fourth of July orator for 1826 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was  Edward Everett. Although only thirty-two he was already a distinguished  speaker. In the course of his oration he apostrophized John Adams and  Thomas Jefferson as venerable survivors of that momentous day, fifty  years earlier, which had witnessed our Declaration of Independence.  But even as Everett was speaking, the aged author of the Declaration  breathed his last at Monticello, and in the afternoon of that same day  Adams died also, murmuring, it is said, with his latest breath, and as  if with the whimsical obstinacy of an old man who hated to be beaten  by his ancient rival, \"Thomas Jefferson still lives.\" But Jefferson was  already gone.    On the first of August, Everett commemorated the career of the two  Revolutionary leaders, and on the following day a greater than Everett,  Daniel Webster, pronounced the famous eulogy in Faneuil Hall. Never were  the thoughts and emotions of a whole country more adequately voiced than  in this commemorative oratory. Its pulse was high with national pride  over the accomplishments of half a century. \"I ask,\" Everett declared,  \"whether more has not been done to extend the domain of civilization, in  fifty years, since the Declaration of Independence, than would have  been done in five centuries of continued colonial subjection?\" Webster  asserted in his peroration: \"It cannot be denied, but by those who would  dispute against the sun, that with America, and in America, a new  era commences in human affairs. This era is distinguished by free  representative governments, by entire religious liberty, by  improved systems of national intercourse, by a newly awakened and an  unconquerable spirit of free enquiry, and by a diffusion of knowledge  through the community such as has been before altogether unknown and  unheard of.\"    Was this merely the \"tall talk\" then so characteristic of American  oratory and soon to be satirized in \"Martin Chuzzlewit\"? Or was it  prompted by a deep and true instinct for the significance of the vast  changes that had come over American life since 1776? The external  changes were familiar enough to Webster's auditors: the opening of  seemingly illimitable territory through the Louisiana Purchase, the  development of roads, canals, and manufactures; a rapid increase in  wealth and population; a shifting of political power due to the rise of  the new West--in a word, the evidences of irrepressible national energy.  But this energy was inadequately expressed by the national literature.  The more cultivated Americans were quite aware of this deficiency. It  was confessed by the pessimistic Fisher Ames and by the ardent young men  who in 1815 founded \"The North American Review.\" British critics in \"The  Edinburgh\" and \"The Quarterly,\" commenting upon recent works of travel  in America, pointed out the literary poverty of the American soil.  Sydney Smith, by no means the most offensive of these critics, declared  in 1820: \"During the thirty or forty years of their independence  they have done absolutely nothing for the sciences, for the arts, for  literature.... In the four quarters of the globe, who reads an American  book? or goes to an American play? or looks at an American picture or  statue?\"    Sydney Smith's question \"Who reads an American book?\" has outlived  all of his own clever volumes. Even while he was asking it, London was  eagerly reading Irving's \"Sketch Book.\" In 1821 came Fenimore Cooper's  Spy and Bryant's \"Poems,\" and by 1826, when Webster was announcing in  his rolling orotund that Adams and Jefferson were no more, the London  and Paris booksellers were covering their stalls with Cooper's \"The Last  of the Mohicans.\" Irving, Cooper, and Bryant are thus the pioneers in a  new phase of American literary activity, often called, for convenience  in labeling, the Knickerbocker Group because of the identification of  these men with New York. And close behind these leaders come a younger  company, destined likewise, in the shy boyish words of Hawthorne, one of  the number, \"to write books that would be read in England.\" For by 1826  Hawthorne and Longfellow were out of college and were trying to learn  to write. Ticknor, Prescott, and Bancroft, somewhat older men, were  settling to their great tasks. Emerson was entering upon his duties as  a minister. Edgar Allan Poe, at that University of Virginia which  Jefferson had just founded, was doubtless revising \"Tamerlane and Other  Poems\" which he was to publish in Boston in the following year. Holmes  was a Harvard undergraduate. Garrison had just printed Whittier's first  published poem in the Newburyport \"Free Press.\" Walt Whitman was a  barefooted boy on Long Island, and Lowell, likewise seven years of age,  was watching the birds in the treetops of Elmwood. But it was Washington  Irving who showed all of these men that nineteenth century England would  be interested in American books.    The very word Knickerbocker is one evidence of the vitality of Irving's  happy imaginings. In 1809 he had invented a mythical Dutch historian  of New York named Diedrich Knickerbocker and fathered upon him a witty  parody of Dr. Mitchill's grave \"Picture of New York.\" To read Irving's  chapters today is to witness one of the rarest and most agreeable of  phenomena, namely, the actual beginning of a legend which the world is  unwilling to let die. The book made Sir Walter Scott's sides ache with  laughter, and reminded him of the humor of Swift and Sterne. But certain  New Yorkers were slow to see the joke.    Irving was himself a New Yorker, born just at the close of the  Revolution, of a Scotch father and English mother. His youth was  pleasantly idle, with a little random education, much theater-going,  and plentiful rambles with a gun along the Hudson River. In 1804 he went  abroad for his health, returned and helped to write the light social  satire of the \"Salmagundi Papers,\" and became, after the publication of  the \"Knickerbocker History,\" a local celebrity. Sailing for England in  1815 on business, he stayed until 1832 as a roving man of letters in  England and Spain and then as Secretary of the American Legation in  London. \"The Sketch Book,\" \"Bracebridge Hall,\" and \"Tales of a Traveler\"  are the best known productions of Irving's fruitful residence in  England. The \"Life of Columbus,\" the \"Conquest of Granada,\" and \"The  Alhambra\" represent his first sojourn in Spain. After his return to  America he became fascinated with the Great West, made the travels  described in his \"Tour of the Prairies,\" and told the story of roving  trappers and the fur trade in \"Captain Bonneville\" and \"Astoria.\"  For four years he returned to Spain as American Minister. In his last  tranquil years at Sunnyside on the Hudson, where he died in 1859, he  wrote graceful lives of Goldsmith and of Washington.    Such a glance at the shelf containing Irving's books suggests but  little of that personal quality to which he owes his significance as  an interpreter of America to the Old World. This son of a narrow, hard,  Scotch dealer in cutlery, this drifter about town when New York was  only a big slovenly village, this light-hearted scribbler of satire and  sentiment, was a gentleman born. His boyhood and youth were passed in  that period of Post-Revolutionary reaction which exhibits the United  States in some of its most unlovely aspects. Historians like Henry  Adams and McMaster have painted in detail the low estate of education,  religion, and art as the new century began. The bitter feeling of the  nascent nation toward Great Britain was intensified by the War of 1812.

A--the snare,  should be made of rabbit wire, four or five strand twisted together.  Should be long enough to make a loop about seven inches in diameter  when set.

Some bend down a sapling for a spring pole, but we think the best way  is to cut and trim up a small pole about ten feet long; fasten the  big end under a root and bend it down over a crotch, stake or small  tree. Snare should be set on a summer sheep path, where it goes  through the bushes.      [Illustration: PATH SET SNARE.]    Stake might be driven down a foot or more back from the path, where a  branch of an evergreen bush would hang over it so as to hide it and a  string long enough from stake or trigger to snare to rest over path.      * * *    The setting of a snare is done thus: A good sound tamarac or other  pole fifteen or twenty feet long is used for the tossing. The butt  end of this must be five or six inches in diameter and the small end  about three inches. A tree with a crotch in it is then selected to  balance the pole upon. Failing to find such a tree in the proper  place, an artificial fork is made by crossing two stout young birch  or tamarac, firmly planted in the ground, and the two upper points  tied together six or ten inches from the top. The balancing or  tossing pole is lodged in this fork so that the part towards the butt  would out-weigh a bear of two or three hundred pounds suspended from  the small end.    Next a stout little birch or spruce is selected and a section of  three or four cut off. From this all the branches are removed, except  one, the small end is pointed and driven deep into the ground a few  inches at one side of the bear road. The snare is made of three  twisted strands of eighteen thread cod line and is firmly tied to the  tossing pole. A few dried branches are stuck in the ground each side  of the path, the pole is depressed so the very end is caught under  the twig on the stick driven in the ground for that purpose and the  noose is stiffened by rubbing balsam branches which leave enough gum  to make it hold its shape.    The noose is kept in the proper position (the bottom being about  sixteen inches above the road and the diameter being about eleven  inches) by blades of dry grass looped to it and the ends let into a  gash on sticks at each side, put there for that purpose. No green  branches are used in the hedge about the road because this would make  the bear suspicious. The snare is now complete and the hunter stands  back and examines it critically. His last act is to rub some beaver  castor on the trunk of some tree standing near the road, ten or  twelve feet from the snare. This is done on another tree at the same  distance on the opposite side of the snare.    Bears are attracted by the smell of the castor and rub themselves  against the tree in the same way as a dog rubs on carrion. When  finished rubbing on one tree he scents the other and in going to get  at the fresh one tries to pass thru the snare. He feels the noose  tighten about his neck and struggles; this pulls the end of the  tossing pole from under the branch trigger, up goes the pole and old  Bruin with it.      * * *    My way, according to a Massachusetts trapper, to trap skunk without  scenting, and it is successful, is to snare them. Use a spring pole  and if one does not grow handy, cut one and set it up as firmly as  possible about four or five feet from the burrow and to one side.  Probably the ground is frozen and you will have to brace it up with  logs or stones or perhaps lash it to a stump or root. When the top of  the pole is bent down it should be caught under the end of a log or  rock on the opposite side of the hole so that it can easily be  dislodged by an animal, either going in or out of the burrow.    The snare or noose is attached to the spring pole directly over the  center of the burrows and the bottom of the noose should be an inch  and a half or two inches from the ground to allow the animal's feet  to pass under it and his little pointed nose to go thru the center.  Set the noose as closely over the entrance of the hole as possible  and one or two carefully arranged twigs will keep it in place.    Strong twine is better for the noose than large cord as the skunk is  less liable to notice it.  When a skunk passes in or out of the hole  the noose becomes tightened about his neck and a slight pull releases  the spring pole which soon strangles him. While this may seem an  elaborate description of so simple a trap, still, like any other  trap, if set in a careless, half-hearted manner, it will meet with  indifferent success and, tho simple the snare, with a little thought  and ingenuity can be applied in almost any situation for the capture  of small game.        CHAPTER XVI.    TRAIL SET SNARE.    Many of the boys, writes an Indiana trapper, have come forth with  their particular snares and methods of making same, all of which I  believe are good, but most of them require to be baited, which is one  bad feature as applied to certain districts, for such has been my  experience that in many localities it is utterly impossible to get  animals to take bait. This snare may be used as a blind or set with  bait as your trapping grounds, or rather the animals, may require.    It is very inexpensive and so simple any boy can make it. First get a  strip of iron one-eighth inch thick, three-eighths or one-half wide.  Cut it in nine inch lengths and bend in the shape of Fig. 2, having  drilled a one-fourth inch hole in either end. Next secure some light  sheet iron, or heavy tin, cut in pieces 2 3/4 inches by 5 3/4 inches  for the pan, and drill a one-fourth inch hole in center of same as  shown in Fig. 3. It is now a very easy matter to rivet the pan or  Fig. 3 to Fig. 2. This done, take some 20 penny spikes and cut off  the heads as per Fig. 1.      [Illustration: TRIP PAN OR PLATE.]    Now brass, or preferably copper wire, can be had on spools at most  any hardware store, which is used for the loops, as it is so pliable  yet sufficiently strong to hold any of the small fur bearers, as it  is made in many sizes. Use the brass or copper wire only for the  loops, as ordinary stove pipe wire is just the article for the  finishing of the snare.    For a blind set to be placed in the run of the animals, make a double  loop, that is, two loops for each snare. Now, take a bunch of these  with you and find the runs or follow the ravines and creeks where  they feed. If you can find a tree in a favorable spot on their runs,  take one of your headless spikes and drive in the base of the tree a  few inches from the ground.    Now take No. 2 with the pan riveted thereon and hook bent and over  spike, driving spike into tree until pan is level and until there is  just room enough to hook loop of wire over head of spike. (See  illustration.) Dig out under pan so same can fall when stepped upon.  Then secure a rock or chunk of sufficient weight and fasten to other  end of wire. Throw this over limb of tree and hook loop over head of  a spike, having first put No. 2 in place.    Put one loop on one side of the pan and the other loop on the other  side, so that an animal coming either way will step upon the pan to  his sorrow. This done, drive a staple in tree over wire running from  spike to limb, which will prevent the animal being pulled over the  limb and escaping.      [Illustration: DOUBLE TRAIL SET.]    Having covered everything up with the natural surroundings and left  no signs, you may claim the first furrier that happens that way and  he will be waiting for you. This snare may also be used with the  ordinary spring pole by driving spike in a stake, then the stake in  the ground, in which case it is best to make the usual V-shaped pen  with stakes or stones, covering same over at top and setting so the  pan will be right in the mouth of the pen and the single loop just  between pan and bait. In this way they tread upon the pan just before  they reach the bait.    You find this snare easily thrown. They will not cost you over three  cents a piece, and any man can easily carry one hundred of them and  not be half loaded.      * * *    In many ways the snare is splendid for lynx. Here in Western Ontario,  says a well known trapper, where the lynx seldom take bait, they may  be taken quite easily in snares set on snowshoe trails. Fig. 1 shows  a wire snare set on such a trail. I go about it in the following  manner: Having found a suitable place along the edge of some swamp or  alder thicket, I cut a spruce or balsam tree, about ten or twelve  feet long, and throw it across the trail. I press the tree down until  the stem of the tree is about twenty inches above the trail, and make  an opening in the trail by cutting a few of the limbs away on the  under side of the trail. Then I set a couple of dead stakes on each  side so as to leave the opening about ten inches wide and hang my  snare between these stakes and directly under the stem of the tree.      [Illustration: TRAIL SET SNARES.]    The snare should be about nine inches in diameter and should be  fastened securely to the tree. It should also be fastened lightly to  the stakes on either side, so it will not spring out of shape. The  best way is to make a little split in the side of each stake, and  fasten the snare with a very small twig stuck in the split stake.    I make the snares of rabbit wire, about four or five plies thick,  twisted. Some trappers prefer to use a cord. The dark colored codfish  line is best, and it is best to use a spring pole snare, and Fig. 3  shows the method of tieing and fastening to the stakes. It will be  seen that when the lynx passes his"]]]
