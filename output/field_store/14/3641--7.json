That grey dog is going to be the biggest  Irish Wolfhound bred in our time, in my opinion; and if you choose  him he will do you credit. He should be a great champion one day.  You will always know, if you take Finn, that Tara was not  ungrateful to you. As for me, I know very well you will never  suspect me of ingratitude.\"    \"It is very, very good of you, and I shall be delighted, delighted  to have one of Tara's children.\"    And then the visitor stopped, gazing thoughtfully at the puppies.  Her kind heart was a good deal moved in this matter, and she  guessed more than the Master gave her credit for guessing, in the  matter of how much hope and pride he had centred on the rearing of  Finn. When the visitor spoke again, it was to say, slowly--    \"Finn is quite splendid, there is not a doubt of that, and I can  easily believe he will do all that you expect of him. But, if I may  be quite frank, what I should really most like would be to have a  female if I might. I should then feel that I not only had one of  Tara's children of this family, but also that I had a possible  future mother of heroes. But--perhaps you want to keep both  females, or to dispose of them otherwise?\"    One would not like to suggest of this good lady that she was  anything but strictly truthful; but it is a fact that she never had  done any breeding of hounds, and that, up till that day at all  events, she had never thought to. But the Master did not know this,  and it was with an undeniable thrill of pleasure that he hailed the  unexpected chance of being able to keep Finn. He had made up his  mind that Finn would be chosen, and was quite prepared and glad to  make the sacrifice; but it was a notable sacrifice, and if the same  end could be served without losing Finn, why that was blithe news.  He was not sure of his intention to keep either of the bitch pups,  and in any case he would not have thought of keeping both of them.  But honesty and real gratitude made him, impelled him, to point out  to the visitor that she might never again have the opportunity of  obtaining the kind of hound that Finn would make. However, she  stuck to her preference for a daughter, and so it was decided.  Three days afterwards a large dog-box on little wheels, with grated  windows and a properly ventilated roof, arrived from Yorkshire, and  was placed outside the back-kitchen door. After a very light  breakfast next morning--it is bad for whelps, or grown dogs either,  to have a full meal before a journey, because the stress and  excitements of railway travelling, which are at least as great for  a dog as those of air-ship travelling would be for a man, arrest  the process of digestion--the fawn bitch puppy was coaxed into this  box, while Tara looked on with a good deal of interest; and that  was the last she saw of the cottage by the Downs. When the fawn  whelp left that travelling-box again, some nine hours later, she  was in the paved stable courtyard of a great house in Yorkshire.    A week later another visitor came, this time from Somerset, and his  choice fell upon a fawn dog, after half an hour spent in trying to  tempt the Master to part with Finn. When this visitor, who was a  famous breeder of Irish Wolfhounds, was leaving, with the fawn dog  whelp in a travelling hamper, he said--    \"But, really, I think you are mistaken, you know, about the grey  whelp. He's a beauty, of course, or I shouldn't want him; but I  fancy you made a mistake not to accept that offer. Fifty guineas is  a longish figure for a three months' pup, with distemper to face  and all that. I'm not sure that I wasn't over rash to make such an  offer.\"    The Master laughed. \"Well,\" he said, \"be thankful that there's no  likelihood of my taking advantage of your rashness. As for  distemper, we don't deal in it at all; don't believe in it. If pups  are consistently nourished, and get no chills and no damp and no  infection, there's no earthly reason why they should ever have  distemper. At least, that's how we've found it.\"    So the fawn dog whelp went, and Finn stayed with the grey bitch  pup, and Tara's family was thus reduced to two. The Master said  that as he had sold only one puppy of the family so far, he really  could not afford to keep Finn's sister; but, however that might be,  he kept her for the present, and now that there were but two of the  youngsters, they began to live more after the fashion of grown  hounds. As autumn advanced the pair were gradually given more and  more in the way of grown-up privileges. They learned to come into  the den with Tara, and to behave themselves with discretion when  there. They never saw such a thing as a whip, but the Master spoke  to them with all the sharp emphasis of a growl when original canine  sin tempted them to the chewing of newspapers, or attempting to  tear rugs. Also, they learned very much from Tara in the matter of  the deportment and dignity which becomes a Wolfhound. In the latter  part of November their meals were reduced in number from four to  three a day, and they were presented with green leather collars  with the Master's name engraved in brass thereon. These were for  outdoor wear only, outside the doors of the home premises that is,  and with them came lessons in leading which required a good deal of  patience on the part of the Mistress of the Kennels, for, after the  first two lessons, which were given by the Master, much of teaching  work fell to her.      Early in the morning, as a general thing, the Master took Tara and  the two youngsters out on the Downs, and these were altogether  delightful experiences for Finn and his sister. It was on one of  these occasions, and just after entering his sixth month, that Finn  tasted the joy and pride of his first kill. He had started with  Tara after a rabbit which had scurried out from behind a little  hillock no more than ten distant paces. The rabbit wheeled at a  tangent from under Tara's nose, and, as it headed down the slope,  was bound to cross Finn's course. The grey whelp's heart swelled  within him; his jaws dripped hot desire as he galloped. The fateful  moment came, and the whelp seized his prey precisely as Tara would  have seized it, a little behind the shoulders. It was bad for the  rabbit, because Finn was neither practised nor powerful enough to  kill instantaneously as his mother would have done. But his  vehemence in shaking was such that before Tara reached his side the  quarry was dead. Tara sniffed at the dead rabbit with the air of an  official inspector of such matters, and then sat up on her haunches  to indicate that she had no wish to interfere with her son's prize.  As for Finn, he was uncertain what course to adopt. The rabbit was  very thoroughly killed; killed with a thoroughness which would have  sufficed for half a dozen rabbits. A number of obscure instincts  were at work in Finn's mind as he jerkily licked, and withdrew  from, and nosed again at his first kill. In the main his instincts  said, \"Tear and eat!\" But, as against that, he was not hungry. The  Master believed in giving the dogs a snack before the morning run,  and breakfast after it, because this prevents a dog being anxious  to pick up any more or less edible trifle of an undesirable kind  that he may meet with, and, then, there were other instincts. It  was long, very long, since Finn's kind had been killers for eating  purposes. Finn was undecided in the matter. He certainly would have  allowed no dog to take his quarry from him; but the matter was  decided for him when the Master arrived on the scene and picked up  the rabbit by its hind legs. Finn jumped to catch it in his jaws;  but the Master spoke with unmistakable decision when he bade Finn  drop it, and there the matter ended, except as a proud and  inspiring memory, and a ground for added swagger on Finn's part.    In the quiet corner of Sussex, where Finn was born, it was the  rarest thing for the Wolfhounds to meet another dog; but it did  occur at times, and then it was odd to see how strong the instincts  of their race was in the whelps. They seemed to take it as a matter  of course that other dogs must be lesser creatures, and that as  such they were to be treated with every sort of courtesy, patience,  and good humour. Finn and his sister never made advances, but they  would stand politely still while the stranger sniffed all round  them. For pups in their first half-year they were extraordinarily  dignified. Much of this, of course, they learned from gracious  Tara, one of the gentlest and sweetest-mannered hounds that ever  lived.  Also, they had that within, in the shape of truly  aristocratic lineage, which gave them great self-respect, a  tradition of courtesy, and a remarkable deal of _savoir-faire_. The  notion of snapping or snarling at a stranger, human or brute,  simply never occurred to either of them; never for an instant. That  there were certain creatures whose part it was to be chased and  killed seemed evident to Finn; but that there was any created thing  in the world to be feared, mistrusted, hated, or snapped at, he did  not believe. It may be that Finn was more of a gentleman and a  sportsman than many who have borne those titles in the world  without challenge or demur from any of their own kind.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VI    THE ORDEAL OF THE RING      Finn's first winter was a mild one, and it passed without his  noticing anything remarkable in climatic conditions. But he was  aware of change when spring came. The Downs round Finn's home never  seemed to get really wet. The drainage of their chalky soil was  such that their surface could not hold much moisture, and outside  the Downs the world was as yet a closed book to Finn. But spring  asserted itself notably in his veins, and appeared to enter into a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#11)"],[1," Fantasie,  every composition always _begins_ with one or two periods which, in  regard to subdivision, balance and directness of statement, are  carefully planned and are complete in themselves. Before it is  possible to follow intelligently the structure of a musical sentence  we must gain a clear idea of what is meant by the frequently used  terms Tonality and Modulation. Since the evolution and acceptance of  our three modern scales:[44] the major, the minor and the  chromatic--which gained their sanction chiefly through the  investigations and compositions of Bach and Rameau--every melody and  the accompanying harmony are said to be in a certain \"tonality\" (or  \"key\") which takes its name from the first tone of the scale in  question, _e.g._, C, E-flat, F sharp, etc. Hence this first tone is  called the Tonic or chief tone and from it ascend the other tones of  the scale. That is, a melody in E-flat major will employ only those  tones found in the scale of E-flat major, and is said to be in that  \"key,\" or \"tonality.\" The same would be true of the harmony involved,  _i.e._, the chords would consist of combinations of the different  tones of this scale. When a melody, as is often the case, employs  tones _not_ found in the scale in question, these are called  _chromatic_[45] changes, and may or may not effect a \"modulation\" or  departure into another key, _e.g._    [Music]    [Footnote 44: It is assumed that the music-lover has, as his  birthright, an instinctive knowledge of the grouping of tones and  semitones in our modern scales. Those who may wish to refresh their  knowledge are recommended to the second Chapter in Foote and  Spalding's _Harmony_, and to the chapter on Scales in Parry's  _Evolution of the Art of Music_.]    [Footnote 45: Color in music is brought about chiefly through their  use.]    The most important means of gaining unity and coherence in a  composition is to have it written in a clearly defined tonality,  especially at the outset. This definite tonality is the \"centre of  gravity,\" so to speak, about which the whole composition revolves. If  this tonal centre were uncertain or wandering, we should have a  feeling of vagueness and perplexity which, except for special dramatic  effect, is never found in works of the great composers. Thus we speak  of a Symphony in C minor, of a Quartet in F major and of a Sonata in  B-flat minor;[46] this foundation key being comparable to the basic  color-scheme of a painting. There is also a particular aesthetic  effect and color-appeal associated with each key; and the listener  should train himself to be sensitive to the brilliance of such keys as  D major and E major, the richness of B major, the dignity of E-flat  major, the almost cloying sweetness of D-flat major and of G-flat  major and the tragic depth of B minor and G minor. No piece, however,  should remain for long in the same key; for music cuts so deeply into  the consciousness that there would result an intolerable monotony.[47]  Even in the simplest folk-songs, therefore, we often find manifested  an instinct for those changes of tonal centre which are technically  called \"Modulations.\" All the keys founded on the twelve semitones of  the chromatic scale are related--though in varying degrees of  closeness; and in modern music, no matter how complex the modulations  often sound, we may be sure that the composer plans them as carefully  as the painter adjusts his color-scheme. For definite acoustical[48]  and harmonic reasons, however, the keys most closely related to a  given tonal centre are those situated a perfect fifth above--the  Dominant; a perfect fifth below--the Subdominant; and the Relative  Minor, the key-note of which is a minor third below, _e.g._, A minor  in relation to C major, C minor to E-flat major. The relative minors  of the Dominant and Subdominant also bear a close relationship to a  given tonic; and into these _five_ keys is made a large majority of  the modulations in any piece of music.[49]    [Music:    Subdominant  Tonic     Dominant    Relative     Relative  Relative  Minor        Minor     Minor]    [Footnote 46: As for example the famous one of Chopin.]    [Footnote 47: Even great composers have at times made this mistake,  _e.g._, Mendelssohn in the first movement of the _Scotch Symphony_,  where the interminable length of the portion in A minor (of all keys!)  is simply deadening in its effect. Compare also the _Prelude to the  Rheingold_; where, however--for dramatic purposes--to depict the world  as \"without form and void\" Wagner remains in the key of E-flat major  for some 150 measures!]    [Footnote 48: It is left to the teacher to explain, by the ratios  found in the overtones of the Harmonic Series, the validity of this  statement.]    [Footnote 49: Some modern theorists, _e.g._, Calvacoressi (see the New  Music Review for September, 1909) have thought that the dominant  relationship was \"overworked.\" It is true that the great charm of  modern music is its freedom and boldness in modulation; but the  dominant keys can never be entirely abandoned, for the relationship  between them and a tonic is as elemental as that between the colors of  the spectroscope.]    Beginning with Beethoven, a modulation into what are known as the  _mediant_ keys became frequent; and is, in fact, a favorite change in  all modern music--the mediant keys being those situated half-way  between a Tonic and Dominant or a Tonic and Subdominant, _e.g._    [Music: Sub-mediant Mediant]    Anyone at all familiar with Beethoven's style will remember how often  his second theme, instead of following the more conventional line of  dominant relationship, is in a mediant key. Good examples may be found  in the first movement of the _Waldstein Sonata_ and in the first and  last movements of the 8th Symphony. A little thought will make clear  that the relationships just set forth include nearly all the possible  ones save those of 2nds and 7ths. Even into these apparently distant  keys, _e.g._, to D-flat major or to B major from C major, modulations  may easily be made by means of the \"enharmonic\"[50] relationship found  in that frequently used modern chord--the Augmented Sixth, _e.g._    [Music: C major B major C major D-flat major]    [Footnote 50: Two tones are said to be \"enharmonic\" when, although  written differently, they sound the same on an instrument of fixed  temperament like the pianoforte, or organ, _e.g._, D-sharp and E-flat,  E and F-flat. A violin, however, can make a distinction between such  notes and often does.]    Next to rhythm, modulation is the most stimulating and enchanting  element in music. No composition of any scope can be considered truly  great unless it abounds in beautiful modulations. Certain composers,  to be sure, have in this respect more genius than others--notably  Schubert, Chopin, Wagner and Franck whose music seems to waft us along  on a magic carpet of delight. But just as Unity depends upon a  definite basic tonality, so Variety is gained by this very freedom of  modulation. Without it is monotony; with too much modulation, an  irritating restlessness. By the perfect balance in his works of these  two related elements a genius may be definitely recognized.    The simplest and on the whole most frequent type of musical sentence  or period consists of eight measures, subdivided into two balancing  phrases of four measures[51] each--the component parts plainly  indicated by various cadences and endings soon to be explained. These  four-measure phrases are often, though not invariably, still further  subdivided into two sections of two measures each. Let us now  corroborate these statements by an examination of the opening sentence  of the Scherzo of Beethoven's _Second Sonata for Pianoforte_. This  concise sentence is an epitome of the chief principles of organic  musical expression. At the outset[52] we see the leading motive, which  consists of an ascending broken chord twice repeated. We see also    [Music]    the first phrase of 4 measures and the second phrase[53] of similar  length, alike subdivided into two sections of 2 measures each. In the  third measure we find a modulation into the dominant key (indicated by  the D-sharp) and in the fourth measure a cadence with a feminine  ending in this key. The second--or after--phrase corresponds exactly  to what has gone before: we have the same repetition of the motive in  a different part of the scale; and finally, in the 8th measure, a  cadence in the home key, also with feminine ending.    [Footnote 51: This assertion holds for most of our Western European  music; though in Hungarian and Scotch music we find a natural fondness  for phrases of _three_ measures, and the Croatians are known for their  phrases of _five_ measures so often used by both Haydn and Schubert.  But it is true that we _tend_ to think in groups which are some  multiple of 2, _i.e._, either 4, 8, 12 or 16 measures.]    [Footnote 52: Always count the first _complete_ measure as _one_.]    [Footnote 53: The two phrases are often designated Thesis and  Antithesis.]    [Music]    When the sentence is played, it is evident how unsatisfactory would be  the effect if a complete stop were attempted at the 4th measure; and  how symmetrical and convincing is the impression when the eight  measures are considered an unbroken sweep of musical thought.[54]  There are, in fact, a few complete compositions in musical literature  which contain but a single sentence of eight measures. As an example  may be cited the song from Schumann's _Lieder Album fuer Jugend_, op.  79, No. 1. (See Supplement No. 19.) For purposes of practical  appreciation[55] it is enough to state that a cadence is an accepted  combination of chords (generally the tonic, dominant and subdominant)  which indicates that some objective, either temporary or final, has  been reached.
