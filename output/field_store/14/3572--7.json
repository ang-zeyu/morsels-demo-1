Some explanation was  also necessary to account for the presence of the two other visitors of  whom he had been told below stairs. As he knew nothing at all about  them, the servant who admitted them never having seen either of them  before, she acknowledged that two gentlemen had called earlier in the  evening; that they had refused to send in their names, but as they had  said they had come to inquire about the duke, she suspected them of  having been in league with the chevalier in the attempt to ruin her  reputation, perhaps they had even promised to help him to carry her off,  but she knew nothing positive about them or their plans. The duke,  contrary to his wont, did not allow himself to be easily convinced by  these lame explanations, but unfortunately for him the lady knew how to  assume an attitude favourable to her purpose. She had been induced, she  said, with the simple confidence born of love, to listen to people who  had led her to suppose they could give her news of one so dear to her as  the duke. From this falsehood she proceeded to bitter reproaches:  instead of defending herself, she accused him of having left her a prey  to anxiety; she went so far as to imply that there must be some  foundation for the hints of the chevalier, until at last the duke,  although he was not guilty of the slightest infidelity, and had  excellent reasons to give in justification of his silence, was soon  reduced to a penitent mood, and changed his threats into entreaties for  forgiveness. As to the shriek he had heard, and which he was sure had  been uttered by the stranger who had forced his way into her room after  the departure of the others, she asserted that his ears must have  deceived him. Feeling that therein lay her best chance of making things  smooth, she exerted herself to convince him that there was no need for  other information than she could give, and did all she could to blot the  whole affair from his memory; and her success was such that at the end  of the interview the duke was more enamoured and more credulous than  ever, and believing he had done her wrong, he delivered himself up to  her, bound hand and foot. Two days later he installed his mistress in  another dwelling....    Madame Rapally also resolved to give up her rooms, and removed to a  house that belonged to her, on the Pont Saint-Michel.    The commander took the condition of Charlotte Boullenois very much to  heart. The physician under whose care he had placed her, after examining  her wounds, had not given much hope of her recovery. It was not that de  Jars was capable of a lasting love, but Charlotte was young and  possessed great beauty, and the romance and mystery surrounding their  connection gave it piquancy. Charlotte's disguise, too, which enabled de  Jars to conceal his success and yet flaunt it in the face, as it were,  of public morality and curiosity, charmed him by its audacity, and above  all he was carried away by the bold and uncommon character of the girl,  who, not content with a prosaic intrigue, had trampled underfoot all  social prejudices and proprieties, and plunged at once into unmeasured  and unrestrained dissipation; the singular mingling in her nature of the  vices of both sexes; the unbridled licentiousness of the courtesan  coupled with the devotion of a man for horses, wine, and fencing; in  short, her eccentric character, as it would now be called, kept a  passion alive which would else have quickly died away in his blase  heart. Nothing would induce him to follow Jeannin's advice to leave  Paris for at least a few weeks, although he shared Jeannin's fear that  the statement they had been forced to give the stranger would bring them  into trouble. The treasurer, who had no love affair on hand, went off;  but the commander bravely held his ground, and at the end of five or six  days, during which no one disturbed him, began to think the only result  of the incident would be the anxiety it had caused him.    Every evening as soon as it was dark he betook himself to the doctor's,  wrapped in his cloak, armed to the teeth, and his hat pulled down over  his eyes. For two days and nights, Charlotte, whom to avoid confusion we  shall continue to call the Chevalier de Moranges, hovered between life  and death. Her youth and the strength of her constitution enabled her at  last to overcome the fever, in spite of the want of skill of the surgeon  Perregaud.    Although de Jars was the only person who visited the chevalier, he was  not the only one who was anxious about the patient's health. Maitre  Quennebert, or men engaged by him to watch, for he did not want to  attract attention, were always prowling about the neighbourhood, so that  he was kept well informed of everything that went on: The instructions  he gave to these agents were, that if a funeral should leave the house,  they were to find out the name of the deceased, and then to let him know  without delay. But all these precautions seemed quite useless: he always  received the same answer to all his questions, \"We know nothing.\" So at  last he determined to address himself directly to the man who could give  him information on which he could rely.    One night the commander left the surgeon's feeling more cheerful than  usual, for the chevalier had passed a good day, and there was every hope  that he was on the road to complete recovery. Hardly had de Jars gone  twenty paces when someone laid a hand on his shoulder. He turned and saw  a man whom, in the darkness, he did not recognise.    \"Excuse me for detaining you, Commander de Jars,\" said Quennebert, \"but  I have a word to say to you.\"    \"Ali! so it's you, sir,\" replied the commander. \"Are you going at last  to give me the opportunity I was so anxious for?\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"We are on more equal terms this time; to-day you don't catch me  unprepared, almost without weapons, and if you are a man of honour you  will measure swords with me.\"    \"Fight a duel with you! why, may I ask? You have never insulted me.\"    \"A truce to pleasantry, sir; don't make me regret that I have shown  myself more generous than you. I might have killed you just now had I  wished. I could have put my pistol to your breast and fired, or said to  you, 'Surrender at discretion!' as you so lately said to me.\"    \"And what use would that have been?\"    \"It would have made a secret safe that you ought never to have known.\"    \"It would have been the most unfortunate thing for you that could have  happened, for if you had killed me the paper would have spoken. So! you  think that if you were to assassinate me you would only have to stoop  over my dead body and search my pockets, and, having found the  incriminating document, destroy it. You seem to have formed no very high  opinion of my intelligence and common sense. You of the upper classes  don't need these qualities, the law is on, your side. But when a humble  individual like myself, a mere nobody, undertakes to investigate a piece  of business about which those in authority are not anxious to be  enlightened, precautions are necessary. It's not enough for him to have  right on his side, he must, in order to secure his own safety, make good  use of his skill, courage, and knowledge. I have no desire to humiliate  you a second time, so I will say no more. The paper is in the hands of  my notary, and if a single day passes without his seeing me he has  orders to break the seal and make the contents public. So you see chance  is still on my side. But now that you are warned there is no need for me  to bluster. I am quite prepared to acknowledge your superior rank, and  if you insist upon it, to speak to you uncovered.\"    \"What do you desire to know, sir?\"    \"How is the Chevalier de Moranges getting on?\"    \"Very badly, very badly.\"    \"Take care, commander; don't deceive me. One is so easily tempted to  believe what one hopes, and I hope so strongly that I dare not believe  what you say. I saw you coming out of the house, not at all with the air  of a man who had just heard bad news, (quite the contrary) you looked at  the sky, and rubbed your hands, and walked with a light, quick step,  that did not speak of grief.\"    \"You're a sharp observer, sir.\"    \"I have already explained to you, sir, that when one of us belonging to  a class hardly better than serfs succeeds by chance or force of  character in getting out of the narrow bounds in which he was born, he  must keep both eyes and ears open. If I had doubted your word as you  have doubted mine on the merest suspicion, you would have said to your  servants, 'Chastise this rascal.' But I am obliged to prove to you that  you did not tell me the truth. Now I am sure that the chevalier is out  of danger.\"    \"If you were so well informed why did you ask me?\"    \"I only knew it by your asserting the contrary.\"    \"What do you mean?\" cried de Jars, who was growing restive under this  cold, satirical politeness.    \"Do me justice, commander. The bit chafes, but yet you must acknowledge  that I have a light hand. For a full week you have been in my power.  Have I disturbed your quiet? Have I betrayed your secret? You know I  have not. And I shall continue to act in the same manner. I hope with  all my heart, however great would be your grief; that the chevalier may  die of his wound. I have not the same reasons for loving him that you  have, so much you can readily understand, even if I do not explain the  cause of my interest in his fate. But in such a matter hopes count for  nothing; they cannot make his temperature either rise or fall. I have  told you I have no wish to force the chevalier to resume his real name.  I may make use of the document and I may not, but if I am obliged to use  it I shall give you warning. Will you, in return, swear to me upon your  honour that you will keep me informed as to the fate of the chevalier,  whether you remain in Paris or whether you leave? But let this agreement  be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#11)"],[1,"did they kill him?\" she asked at last, fixing her great eyes in  terror on the count.    \"Yesterday evening, as he left this castle, on the way to his own home,  a man suddenly sprang out upon him before the Porta Petruccia: it was  one of Andre's favourites, Conrad of Gottis chosen no doubt because he  had a grievance against the incorruptible magistrate on account of some  sentence passed against him, and the murder would therefore be put down  to motives of private revenge. The cowardly wretch gave a sign to two or  three companions, who surrounded the victim and robbed him of all means  of escape. The poor old man looked fixedly at his assassin, and asked  him what he wanted. 'I want you to lose your life at my hands, as I lost  my case at yours!' cried the murderer, and leaving him no time to  answer, he ran him through with his sword. Then the rest fell upon the  poor man, who did not even try to call for help, and his body was  riddled with wounds and horribly mutilated, and then left bathed in its  blood.\"    \"Terrible!\" murmured the queen, covering her face.    \"It was only their first effort; the proscription lists are already  full: Andre must needs have blood to celebrate his accession to the  throne of Naples. And do you know, Joan, whose name stands first in the  doomed list?\"    \"Whose?\" cried the queen, shuddering from head to foot.    \"Mine,\" said the count calmly.    \"Yours!\" cried Joan, drawing herself up to her full height; \"are you to  be killed next! Oh, be careful, Andre; you have pronounced your own  death-sentence. Long have I turned aside the dagger pointing to your  breast, but you put an end to all my patience. Woe to you, Prince of  Hungary! the blood which you have spilt shall fall on your own head.\"    As she spoke she had lost her pallor; her lovely face was fired with  revenge, her eyes flashed lightning. This child of sixteen was terrible  to behold; she pressed her lover's hand with convulsive tenderness, and  clung to him as if she would screen him with her own body.    \"Your anger is awakened too late,\" said he gently and sadly; for at this  moment Joan seemed so lovely that he could reproach her with nothing.  \"You do not know that his mother has left him a talisman preserving him  from sword and poison?\"    \"He will die,\" said Joan firmly; the smile that lighted up her face was  so unnatural that the count was dismayed, and dropped his eyes.    The next day the young Queen of Naples, lovelier, more smiling than  ever, sitting carelessly in a graceful attitude beside a window which  looked out on the magnificent view of the bay, was busy weaving a cord  of silk and gold. The sun had run nearly two-thirds of his fiery course,  and was gradually sinking his rays in the clear blue waters where  Posilippo's head is reflected with its green and flowery crown. A warm,  balmy breeze that had passed over the orange trees of Sorrento and  Amalfi felt deliciously refreshing to the inhabitants of the capital,  who had succumbed to torpor in the enervating softness of the day. The  whole town was waking from a long siesta, breathing freely after a  sleepy interval; the Molo was covered with a crowd of eager people  dressed out in the brightest colours; the many cries of a festival,  joyous songs, love ditties sounded from all quarters of the vast  amphitheatre, which is one of the chief marvels of creation; they came  to the ears of Joan, and she listened as she bent over her work,  absorbed in deep thought. Suddenly, when she seemed most busily  occupied, the indefinable feeling of someone near at hand, and the touch  of something on her shoulder, made her start: she turned as though waked  from a dream by contact with a serpent, and perceived her husband,  magnificently dressed, carelessly leaning against the back of her chair.  For a long time past the prince had not come to his wife in this  familiar fashion, and to the queen the pretence of affection and  careless behaviour augured ill. Andre did not appear to notice the look  of hatred and terror that had escaped Joan in spite of herself, and  assuming the best expression of gentleness as that his straight hard  features could contrive to put on in such circumstances as these, he  smilingly asked--    \"Why are you making this pretty cord, dear dutiful wife?\"    \"To hang you with, my lord,\" replied the queen, with a smile.    Andre shrugged his shoulders, seeing in the threat so incredibly rash  nothing more than a pleasantry in rather bad taste. But when he saw that  Joan resumed her work, he tried to renew the conversation.    \"I admit,\" he said, in a perfectly calm voice, \"that my question is  quite unnecessary: from your eagerness to finish this handsome piece of  work, I ought to suspect that it is destined for some fine knight of  yours whom you propose to send on a dangerous enterprise wearing your  colours. If so, my fair queen, I claim to receive my orders from your  lips: appoint the time and place for the trial, and I am sure beforehand  of carrying off a prize that I shall dispute with all your adorers.\"    \"That is not so certain,\" said Joan, \"if you are as valiant in war as in  love.\" And she cast on her husband a look at once seductive and  scornful, beneath which the young man blushed up to his eyes.    \"I hope,\" said Andre, repressing his feelings, \"I hope soon to give you  such proofs of my affection that you will never doubt it again.\"    \"And what makes you fancy that, my lord?\"    \"I would tell you, if you would listen seriously.\"    \"I am listening.\"    \"Well, it is a dream I had last night that gives me such confidence in  the future.\"    \"A dream! You surely ought to explain that.\"    \"I dreamed that there was a grand fete in the town: an immense crowd  filled the streets like an overflowing torrent, and the heavens were  ringing with their shouts of joy; the gloomy granite facades were hidden  by hangings of silk and festoons of flowers; the churches were decorated  as though for some grand ceremony. I was riding side by side with you.\"  Joan made a haughty movement: \"Forgive me, madam, it was only a dream: I  was on your right, riding a fine white horse, magnificently caparisoned,  and the chief-justice of the kingdom carried before me a flag unfolded  in sign of honour. After riding in triumph through the main  thoroughfares of the city, we arrived, to the sound of trumpets and  clarions, at the royal church of Saint Clara, where your grandfather and  my uncle are buried, and there, before the high altar, the pope's  ambassador laid your hand in mine and pronounced a long discourse, and  then on our two heads in turn placed the crown of Jerusalem and Sicily;  after which the nobles and the people shouted in one voice, 'Long live  the King and Queen of Naples!' And I, wishing to perpetuate the memory  of so glorious a day, proceeded to create knights among the most zealous  in our court.\"    \"And do you not remember the names of the chosen persons whom you judged  worthy of your royal favours?\"    \"Assuredly, madam: Bertrand, Count of Artois.\"    \"Enough, my lord; I excuse you from naming the rest: I always supposed  you were loyal and generous, but you give me fresh proof of it by  showing favour to men whom I most honour and trust. I cannot tell if  your wishes are likely soon to be realised, but in any case feel sure of  my perpetual gratitude.\"    Joan's voice did not betray the slightest emotion; her look had became  kind, and the sweetest smile was on her lips. But in her heart Andre's  death was from that moment decided upon. The prince, too much  preoccupied with his own projects of vengeance, and too confident in his  all-powerful talisman and his personal valour, had no suspicion that his  plans could be anticipated. He conversed a long time with his wife in a  chatting, friendly way, trying to spy out her secret, and exposing his  own by his interrupted phrases and mysterious reserves. When he fancied  that every cloud of former resentment, even the lightest, had  disappeared from Joan's brow, he begged her to go with her suite on a  magnificent hunting expedition that he was organising for the 20th of  August, adding that such a kindness on her part would be for him a sure  pledge of their reconciliation and complete forgetfulness of the past.  Joan promised with a charming grace, and the prince retired fully  satisfied with the interview, carrying with him the conviction that he  had only to threaten to strike a blow at the queen's favourite to ensure  her obedience, perhaps even her love.    But on the eve of the 20th of August a strange and terrible scene was  being enacted in the basement storey of one of the lateral towers of  Castel Nuovo. Charles of Durazzo, who had never ceased to brood secretly  over his infernal plans, had been informed by the notary whom he had  charged to spy upon the conspirators, that on that particular evening  they were about to hold a decisive meeting, and therefore, wrapped in a  black cloak, he glided into the underground corridor and hid himself  behind a pillar, there to await the issue of the conference. After two  dreadful hours of suspense, every second marked out by the beating of  his heart, Charles fancied he heard the sound of a door very carefully  opened; the feeble ray of a lantern in the vault scarcely served to  dispel the darkness, but a man coming away from the wall approached him  walking like a living statue. Charles gave a slight cough, the sign  agreed upon. The man put out his light and hid away the dagger he had  drawn in case of a surprise.    \"Is it you, Master Nicholas?\" asked the duke in a low voice.    \"It is I, my lord.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"They have just fixed the prince's death for tomorrow, on his way to the  hunt.\"    \"Did you recognise every conspirator?\"    \"Every one, though their faces were masked; when they gave their vote  for death, I knew them by their voices.\"    \"Could you point out to me who they are?\"    \"Ye"]]]
