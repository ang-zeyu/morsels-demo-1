He and I will die together, or side by side will  we conquer.\" The youthful warrior tried in vain to rouse the courage  of his companions: they trembled, and would not move. So Wiglaf,  holding on high his shield, plunged into the fiery cloud and moved  towards his king, crying aloud: \"Beowulf, my dear lord, let not thy  glory be dimmed. Achieve this last deed of valour, as thou didst  promise in days of yore, that thy fame should not fall, and I will aid  thee.\"    The sound of another voice roused the dragon to greater fury, and  again came the fiery cloud, burning up like straw Wiglaf's linden  shield, and torturing both warriors as they stood behind the iron  shield with their heated armour. But they fought on manfully, and  Beowulf, gathering up his strength, struck the dragon such a blow on  the head that his ancient sword was shivered to fragments. The dragon,  enraged, now flew at Beowulf and seized him by the neck with his  poisonous fangs, so that the blood gushed out in streams, and ran down  his corslet. Wiglaf was filled with grief and horror at this dreadful  sight, and, leaving the protection of Beowulf's iron shield, dashed  forth at the dragon, piercing the scaly body in a vital part. At once  the fire began to fade away, and Beowulf, mastering his anguish, drew  his broad knife, and with a last effort cut the hideous reptile  asunder. Then the agony of the envenomed wound came upon him, and his  limbs burnt and ached with intolerable pain. In growing distress he  staggered to a rough ancient seat, carved out of the rock, hard by  the door of the barrow. There he sank down, and Wiglaf laved his brow  with water from the little stream, which boiled and steamed no longer.  Then Beowulf partially recovered himself, and said: \"Now I bequeath to  thee, my son, the armour which I also inherited. Fifty years have I  ruled this people in peace, so that none of my neighbours durst attack  us. I have endured and toiled much on this earth, have held my own  justly, have pursued none with crafty hatred, nor sworn unjust oaths.  At all this may I rejoice now that I lie mortally wounded. Do thou, O  dear Wiglaf, bring forth quickly from the cave the treasures for which  I lose my life, that I may see them and be glad in my nation's wealth  ere I die.\"    Thereupon Wiglaf entered the barrow, and was dazed by the bewildering  hoard of costly treasures. Filling his arms with such a load as he  could carry, he hastened out of the barrow, fearing even then to find  his lord dead. Then he flung down the treasures--magic armour,  dwarf-wrought swords, carved goblets, flashing gems, and a golden  standard--at Beowulf's feet, so that the ancient hero's dying gaze  could fall on the hoard he had won for his people. But Beowulf was now  so near death that he swooned away, till Wiglaf again flung water over  him, and the dying champion roused himself to say, as he grasped his  kinsman's hand and looked at the glittering heap before him:        \"I thank God eternal,    the great King of Glory,      For the vast treasures    which I here gaze upon,      That I ere my death-day    might for my people      Win so great wealth.    Since I have given my life,      Thou must now look to    the needs of the nation;      Here dwell I no longer,    for Destiny calleth me!      Bid thou my warriors    after my funeral pyre      Build me a burial-cairn    high on the sea-cliff's head;      It shall for memory    tower up on Hronesness,      So that the seafarers    Beowulf's Barrow      Henceforth shall name it,    they who drive far and wide      Over the mighty flood    their foamy keels.      Thou art the last of all    the kindred of Wagmund!      Wyrd has swept all my kin,    all the brave chiefs away!      Now must I follow them!\"    These last words spoken, Beowulf fell back, and his soul passed away,  to meet the joy reserved for all true and steadfast spirits. The hero  was dead, but amid his grief Wiglaf yet remembered that the dire  monster too lay dead, and the folk were delivered from the horrible  plague, though at terrible cost! Wiglaf, as he mourned over his dead  lord, resolved that no man should joy in the treasures for which so  grievous a price had been paid--the cowards who deserted their king  should help to lay the treasures in his grave and bury them far from  human use and profit. Accordingly, when the ten faithless dastards  ventured out from the shelter of the wood, and came shamefacedly to  the place where Wiglaf sat, sorrowing, at the head of dead Beowulf, he  stilled their cries of grief with one wave of the hand, which had  still been vainly striving to arouse his king by gentle touch, and,  gazing scornfully at them, he cried: \"Lo! well may a truthful man say,  seeing you here, safely in the war-gear and ornaments which our dead  hero gave you, that Beowulf did but throw away his generous gifts,  since all he bought with them was treachery and cowardice in the day  of battle! No need had Beowulf to boast of his warriors in time of  danger! Yet he alone avenged his people and conquered the fiend--I  could help him but little in the fray, though I did what I could: all  too few champions thronged round our hero when his need was sorest.  Now are all the joys of love and loyalty ended; now is all prosperity  gone from our nation, when foreign princes hear of your flight and  the shameless deed of this day. Better is death to every man than a  life of shame!\"    [Illustration: The death of Beowulf]    The Geats stood silent, abashed before the keen and deserved  reproaches of the young hero, and they lamented the livelong day. None  left the shore and their lord's dead corpse; but one man who rode over  the cliff near by saw the mournful little band, with Beowulf dead in  the midst. This warrior galloped away to tell the people, saying: \"Now  is our ruler, the lord of the Geats, stretched dead on the plain,  stricken by the dragon which lies dead beside him; and at his head  sits Wiglaf, son of Weohstan, lamenting his royal kinsman. Now is the  joy and prosperity of our folk vanished! Now shall our enemies make  raids upon us, for we have none to withstand them! But let us hasten  to bury our king, to bear him royally to his grave, with mourning and  tears of woe.\" These unhappy tidings roused the Geats, and they  hastened to see if it were really true, and found all as the messenger  had said, and wondered at the mighty dragon and the glorious hoard of  gold. They feared the monster and coveted the treasure, but all felt  that the command now lay with Wiglaf. At last Wiglaf roused himself  from his silent grief and said: \"O men of the Geats, I am not to blame  that our king lies here lifeless. He would fight the dragon and win  the treasure; and these he has done, though he lost his life therein;  yea, and I aided him all that I might, though it was but little I  could do. Now our dear lord Beowulf bade me greet you from him, and  bid you to make for him, after his funeral pyre, a great and mighty  cairn, even as he was the most glorious of men in his lifetime. Bring  ye all the treasures, bring quickly a bier, and place thereon our  king's corpse, and let us bear our dear lord to Hronesness, where  his funeral fire shall be kindled, and his burial cairn built.\"    The Geats, bitterly grieving, fulfilled Wiglaf's commands. They  gathered wood for the fire, and piled it on the cliff-head; then eight  chosen ones brought thither the treasures, and threw the dragon's body  over the cliff into the sea; then a wain, hung with shields, was  brought to bear the corpse of Beowulf to Hronesness, where it was  solemnly laid on the funeral pile and consumed to ashes.        \"There then the Weder Geats    wrought for their ruler dead      A cairn on the ocean cliff    widespread and lofty,      Visible far and near    by vessels' wandering crews.      They built in ten days' space    the hero's monument,      And wrought with shining swords    the earthen rampart wall,      So that the wisest men    worthy might deem it.      Then in that cairn they placed    necklets and rings and gems      Which from the dragon's hoard    brave men had taken.      Back to the earth they gave    treasures of ancient folk,      Gold to the gloomy mould,    where it now lieth      Useless to sons of men    as it e'er was of yore.      Then round the mound there rode    twelve manly warriors,      Chanting their bitter grief,    singing the hero dead,      Mourning their noble king    in fitting words of woe!      They praised his courage high    and his proud, valiant deeds,      Honoured him worthily,    as it is meet for men      Duly to praise in words    their friendly lord and king      When his soul wanders forth    far from its fleshly home.      So all the Geat chiefs,    Beowulf's bodyguard,      Wept for their leader's fall:    sang in their loud laments      That he of earthly kings    mildest to all men was,      Gentlest, most gracious,    most keen to win glory.\"          CHAPTER II: THE DREAM OF MAXEN WLEDIG      The Position of Constantine    It would seem that the Emperor Constantine the Great loomed very large  in the eyes of mediaeval England. Even in Anglo-Saxon times many  legends clustered round his name, so that Cynewulf, the religious poet  of early England, wrote the poem of \"Elene\" mainly on the subject of  his conversion. The story of the Vision of the Holy Cross with the  inscription _In hoc signo vinces_ was inspiring to a poet to whom the  heathen were a living reality, not a distant abstraction; and  Constantine's generosity to the Church of Rome and its bishop  Sylvester added another element of attraction to his character in the  mediaeval mind. It is hardly surprising that other legends of his  conversion and generosity should have sprung up, which differ entirely  from the earlier and more authentic record. Thus \"the moral"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#11)"],[1,"tone of her voice. \"And you see  here Tsoay of the People--the Apaches--while I am Fox.\" He was giving  her the English equivalent of his tribal name.    \"Apaches.\" She tried to repeat the word with the same accent he had  used. \"And what are Apaches?\"    \"Indians--Amerindians,\" he explained. \"But you have not answered my  question, Kaydessa. Why do you run from your own people?\"    \"Not from my people,\" she said, shaking her head determinedly. \"From  those others. It is like this--Oh, how can I make you understand  rightly?\" She spread her wet hands out before her in the moonlight, the  damp patches on her sleeves clinging to her arms. \"There are my people  of the Golden Horde, though once we were different and we can remember  bits of that previous life. Then there are also the men who live in the  sky ship and use the machine so that we think only the thoughts they  would have us think. Now why,\" she looked at Travis intently--\"do I wish  to tell you all this? It is strange. You say you are  Indian--American--are we then enemies? There is a part memory which says  that we are ... were....\"    \"Let us rather say,\" he corrected her, \"that the Apaches and the Horde  are not enemies here and now, no matter what was before.\" That was the  truth, Travis recognized. By all accounts his people had come out of  Asia in the very dim beginnings of migrating peoples. For all her  dark-red hair and gray eyes, this girl who had been arbitrarily returned  to a past just as they had been by Redax, could well be a distant  clan-cousin.    \"You--\" Kaydessa's fingers rested for a moment on his wrist--\"you, too,  were sent here from across the stars. Is this not so?\"    \"It is so.\"    \"And there are those here who govern you now?\"    \"No. We are free.\"    \"How did you become free?\" she demanded fiercely.    Travis hesitated. He did not want to tell of the wrecked ship, the fact  that his people possessed no real defenses against the  Russian-controlled colony.    \"We went to the mountains,\" he replied evasively.    \"Your governing machine failed?\" Kaydessa laughed. \"Ah, they are so  great, those men of the machines. But they are smaller and weaker when  their machines cannot obey them.\"    \"It is so with your camp?\" Travis probed gently. He was not quite sure  of her meaning, but he dared not ask more detailed questions without  dangerously revealing his own ignorance.    \"In some manner their control machine--it can only work upon those  within a certain distance. They discovered that in the days of the first  landing, when hunters went out freely and many of them did not return.  After that when hunters were sent out to learn how lay this land, they  went along in the flyer with a machine so that there would be no more  escapes. But we knew!\" Kaydessa's fingers curled into small fists. \"Yes,  we knew that if we could get beyond the machines, there was freedom for  us. And we planned--many of us--planned. Then nine or ten sleeps ago  those others were very excited. They gathered in their ship, watching  their machines. And something happened. For a while all those machines  went dead.    \"Jagatai, Kuchar, my brother Hulagur, Menlik....\" She was counting the  names off on her fingers. \"They raided the horse herd, rode out....\"    \"And you?\"    \"I, too, should have ridden. But there was Aljar, my sister--Kuchar's  wife. She was very near her time and to ride thus, fleeing and fast,  might kill her and the child. So I did not go. Her son was born that  night, but the others had the machine at work once more. We might long  to go here,\" she brought her fist up to her breast, and then raised it  to her head--\"but there was that _here_ which kept us to the camp and  their will. We only knew that if we could reach the mountains, we might  find our people who had already gained their freedom.\"    \"But you are here. How did you escape?\" Tsoay wanted to know.    \"They knew that I would have gone had it not been for Aljar. So they  said they would make her ride out with them unless I played guide to  lead them to my brother and the others. Then I knew I must take up the  sword of duty and hunt with them. But I prayed that the spirits of the  upper air look with favor upon me, and they granted aid....\" Her eyes  held a look of wonder. \"For when we were out on the plains and well away  from the settlement, a grass devil attacked the leader of the searching  party, and he dropped the mind control and so it was broken. Then I  rode. Blue Sky Above knows how I rode. And those others are not with  their horses as are the people of the Wolf.\"    \"When did this happen?\"    \"Three suns ago.\"    Travis counted back in his mind. Her date for the failure of the machine  in the Russian camp seemed to coincide with the crash landing of the  American ship. Had one thing any connection with the other? It was very  possible. The planeting spacer might have fought some kind of weird duel  with the other colony before it plunged to earth on the other side of  the mountain range.    \"Do you know where in these mountains your people hide?\"    Kaydessa shook her head. \"Only that I must head south, and when I reach  the highest peak make a signal fire on the north slope. But that I  cannot do now, for those in the flyer may see it. I know they are on my  trail, for twice I have seen it. Listen, Fox, I ask this of you--I,  Kaydessa, who am eldest daughter to the Khan--for you are like unto us,  a warrior and a brave man, that I believe. It may be that you cannot be  governed by their machine, for you have not rested under their spell,  nor are of our blood. Therefore, if they come close enough to send forth  the call, the call I must obey as if I were a slave dragged upon a horse  rope, then do you bind my hands and feet and hold me here, no matter how  much I struggle to follow that command. For that which is truly me does  not want to go. Will you swear this by the fires which expel demons?\"    The utter sincerity of her tone convinced Travis that she was pleading  for aid against a danger she firmly believed in. Whether she was right  about his immunity to the Russian mental control was another matter, and  one he would rather not put to the test.    \"We do not swear by your fires, Blue Wolf Maiden, but by the Path of the  Lightning.\" His fingers moved as if to curl about the sacred charred  wood his people had once carried as \"medicine.\" \"So do I promise!\"    She looked at him for a long moment and then nodded in satisfaction.    They left the pool and pushed on toward the mountain slopes, working  their way back to the pass. A low growl out of the dark brought them to  an instant halt. Naginlta's warning was sharp; there was danger ahead,  acute danger.    The moonlight from the moons made a weird pattern of light and dark on  the stretch ahead. Anything from a slinking four-footed hunter to a war  party of intelligent beings might have been lying in wait there.    A flitting shadow out of shadows. Nalik'ideyu pressed against Travis'  legs, making a barrier of her warm body, attracting his attention to a  spot at the left perhaps a hundred yards on. There was a great splotch  of dark there, large enough to hide a really formidable opponent; that  wordless communication between animal and man told Travis that such an  opponent was just what was lurking there.    Whatever lay in ambush beside the upper track was growing impatient as  its destined prey ceased to advance, the coyotes reported.    \"Your left--beyond that pointed rock--in the big shadow--\"    \"Do you see it?\" Tsoay demanded.    \"No. But the _mba'a_ do.\"    The men had their bows ready, arrows set to the cords. But in this light  such weapons were practically useless unless the enemy moved into the  path of the moon.    \"What is it?\" Kaydessa asked in a half whisper.    \"Something waits for us ahead.\"    Before he could stop her, she set her fingers to her lips and gave a  piercing whistle.    There was answering movement in the shadow. Travis shot at that, his  arrow followed instantly by one from Tsoay. There was a cry, scaling up  in a throat-scalding scream which made Travis flinch. Not because of  the sound, but because of the hint which lay behind it--could it have  been a human cry?    The thing flopped out into a patch of moonlight. It was four-limbed, its  body silvery--and it was large. But the worst was that it had been  groveling on all fours when it fell, and now it was rising on its hind  feet, one forepaw striking madly at the two arrows dancing head-deep in  its upper shoulder. Man? No! But something sufficiently manlike to chill  the three downtrail.    A whirling four-footed hunter dashed in, snapped at the creature's legs,  and it squalled again, aiming a blow with a forepaw; but the attacking  coyote was already gone. Together Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu were  harassing the creature, just as they had fought the split horn, giving  the hunters time to shoot. Travis, although he again felt that touch of  horror and disgust he could not account for, shot again.    Between them the Apaches must have sent a dozen arrows into the raving  beast before it went to its knees and Naginlta sprang for its throat.  Even then the coyote yelped and flinched, a bleeding gash across its  head from the raking talons of the dying thing. When it no longer moved,  Travis approached to see more closely what they had brought down. That  smell....    Just as the embroidery on Kaydessa's jacket had awakened memories from  his Terran past, so did this stench remind him of something.  Where--when--had he smelled it before? Travis connected it with dark,  dark and danger. Then he gasped in a half exclamation.    Not on this world, no, but on two others: two worlds of that broken  stellar empire where he had been an involuntary explorer two planet  years ago! The beast things which had lived in the dark of the desert  world the Terrans' wandering galactic derelict had landed upon. Yes, the  beast"]]]
