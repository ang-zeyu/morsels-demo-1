I leave the interpretation of this  performance to others, more venturesome than I. Plenty of theories are  based on equally shaky foundations. Blow on them and they sink into the  quagmire of oblivion.    The laying is finished, or perhaps the cylinder is full. A final  partition closes the last cell. A rampart is now built, at the orifice  of the tube itself, to forbid the ill-disposed all access to the home.  This is a thick plug, a massy work of fortification, whereon the Osmia  spends enough mortar to partition off any number of cells. A whole day  is not too long for making this barricade, especially in view of the  minute finishing-touches, when the Osmia fills up with putty every chink  through which the least atom could slip. The mason completing a wall  smooths his plaster and brings it to a fine surface while it is still  wet; the Osmia does the same, or almost. With little taps of the  mandibles and a continual shaking of her head, a sign of her zest for  the work, she smooths and polishes the surface of the lid for hours at a  time. After such pains, what foe could visit the dwelling?    And yet there is one, an Anthrax, A. sinuata (Cf. \"The Life of the Fly\":  chapters 2 and 4.--Translator's Note.), who will come later on, in the  height of summer, and succeed, invisible bit of thread that she is, in  making her way to the grub through the thickness of the door and the web  of the cocoon. In many cells, mischief of another kind has already been  done. During the progress of the works, an impudent Midge, one of the  Tachina-flies, who feeds her family on the victuals amassed by the Bee,  hovers in front of the galleries. Does she penetrate to the cells and  lay her eggs there in the mother's absence? I could never catch the  sneak in the act. Does she, like that other Tachina who ravages cells  stocked with game (The cells of the Hunting Wasps.--Translator's Note.),  nimbly deposit her eggs on the Osmia's harvest at the moment when the  Bee is going indoors? It is possible, though I cannot say for certain.  The fact remains that we soon see the Midge's grub-worms swarming around  the larva, the daughter of the house. There are ten, fifteen, twenty or  more of them gnawing with their pointed mouths at the common dish and  turning the food into a heap of fine, orange-coloured vermicelli. The  Bee's grub dies of starvation. It is life, life in all its ferocity  even in these tiny creatures. What an expenditure of ardent labour, of  delicate cares, of wise precautions, to arrive at...what? Her offspring  sucked and drained dry by the hateful Anthrax; her family sweated and  starved by the infernal Tachina.    The victuals consist mostly of yellow flour. In the centre of the heap,  a little honey is disgorged, which turns the pollen-dust into a firm,  reddish paste. On this paste the egg is laid, not flat, but upright,  with the fore-end free and the hind-end lightly held and fixed in the  plastic mass. When hatched, the young grub, kept in its place by its  rear-end, need only bend its neck a little to find the honey-soaked  paste under its mouth. When it grows stronger, it will release itself  from its support and eat up the surrounding flour.    All this is touching, in its maternal logic. For the new-born, dainty  bread-and-honey; for the adolescent, dry bread. In cases where  the provisions are all of a kind, these delicate precautions are  superfluous. The victuals of the Anthophorae and the Chalicodomae  consist of flowing honey, the same throughout. The egg is then laid at  full length on the surface, without any particular arrangement, thus  compelling the new-born grub to take its first mouthfuls at random. This  has no drawback, as the food is of the same quality throughout. But,  with the Osmia's provisions--dry powder on the edges, jam in the  centre--the grub would be in danger if its first meal were not regulated  in advance. To begin with pollen not seasoned with honey would be  fatal to its stomach. Having no choice of its mouthfuls because of its  immobility and being obliged to feed on the spot where it was hatched,  the young grub must needs be born on the central mass, where it has only  to bend its head a little way in order to find what its delicate stomach  calls for. The place of the egg, therefore, fixed upright by its base in  the middle of the red jam, is most judiciously chosen. What a contrast  between this exquisite maternal forethought and the horrible destruction  by the Anthrax and the Midge!    The egg is rather large for the size of the Osmia. It is cylindrical,  slightly curved, rounded at both ends and transparent. It soon becomes  cloudy, while remaining diaphanous at each extremity. Fine lines, hardly  perceptible to the most penetrating lens, show themselves in transverse  circles. These are the first signs of segmentation. A contraction  appears in the front hyaline part, marking the head. An extremely  thin opaque thread runs down either side. This is the cord of tracheae  communicating between one breathing-hole and another. At last, the  segments show distinctly, with their lateral pads. The grub is born.    At first, one would think that there was no hatching in the proper sense  of the word--that is to say, no bursting and casting of a wrapper.  The most minute attention is necessary to show that appearances are  deceptive and that actually a fine membrane is thrown off from front to  back. This infinitesimal shred is the shell of the egg.    The grub is born. Fixed by its base, it curves into an arc and bends its  head, until now held erect, down to the red mass. The meal begins. Soon  a yellow cord occupying the front two-thirds of the body proclaims that  the digestive apparatus is swelling out with food. For a fortnight,  consume your provender in peace, my child; then spin your cocoon: you  are now safe from the Tachina! Shall you be safe from the Anthrax'  sucker later on? Alack!          CHAPTER 3. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SEXES.    Does the insect know beforehand the sex of the egg which it is about to  lay? When examining the stock of food in the cells just now, we began  to suspect that it does, for each little heap of provisions is carefully  proportioned to the needs at one time of a male and at another of a  female. What we have to do is to turn this suspicion into a certainty  demonstrated by experiment. And first let us find out how the sexes are  arranged.    It is not possible to ascertain the chronological order of a laying,  except by going to suitably-chosen species. Digging up the burrows of  Cerceris-, Bembex- or Philanthus-wasps will never tell us that this grub  has taken precedence of that in point of time nor enable us to decide  whether one cocoon in a colony belongs to the same family as another. To  compile a register of births is absolutely impossible here. Fortunately  there are a few species in which we do not find this difficulty: these  are the Bees who keep to one gallery and build their cells in storeys.  Among the number are the different inhabitants of the bramble-stumps,  notably the Three-pronged Osmiae, who form an excellent subject for  observation, partly because they are of imposing-size--bigger than any  other bramble-dwellers in my neighbourhood--partly because they are so  plentiful.    Let us briefly recall the Osmia's habits. Amid the tangle of a hedge, a  bramble-stalk is selected, still standing, but a mere withered stump. In  this the insect digs a more or less deep tunnel, an easy piece of work  owing to the abundance of soft pith. Provisions are heaped up right at  the bottom of the tunnel and an egg is laid on the surface of the  food: that is the first-born of the family. At a height of some twelve  millimetres (About half an inch.--Translator's Note.), a partition  is fixed, formed of bramble saw-dust and of a green paste obtained by  masticating particles of the leaves of some plant that has not yet  been identified. This gives a second storey, which in its turn receives  provisions and an egg, the second in order of primogeniture. And so it  goes on, storey by storey, until the cylinder is full. Then a thick plug  of the same green material of which the partitions are formed closes the  home and keeps out marauders.    In this common cradle, the chronological order of births is perfectly  clear. The first-born of the family is at the bottom of the series; the  last-born is at the top, near the closed door. The others follow from  bottom to top in the same order in which they followed in point of  time. The laying is numbered automatically; each cocoon tells us its  respective age by the place which it occupies.    To know the sexes, we must wait for the month of June. But it would be  unwise to postpone our investigations until that period. Osmia-nests are  not so common that we can hope to pick one up each time that we go out  with that object; besides, if we wait for the hatching-period before  examining the brambles, it may happen that the order has been disturbed  through some insects' having tried to make their escape as soon as  possible after bursting their cocoons; it may happen that the male  Osmiae, who are more forward than the females, are already gone. I  therefore set to work a long time beforehand and devote my leisure in  winter to these investigations.    The bramble-sticks are split and the cocoons taken out one by one and  methodically transferred to glass tubes, of approximately the same  diameter as the native cylinder. These cocoons are arranged one on  top of the other in exactly the same order that they occupied in the  bramble; they are separated from one another by a cotton plug, an  insuperable obstacle to the future insect. There is thus no fear that  the contents of the cells may become mixed or transposed; and I am saved  the trouble of keeping a laborious watch. Each insect can hatch at its  own time, in my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#11)"],[1,"food derived?]    21. In our country and climate, and also in colder climates, fatty articles  of food are principally derived from the animal creation, such as meat or  flesh, milk and butter. But most of the bread-stuffs contain more or less  fat or oil; Indian meal as much as nine parts in a hundred.    [Sidenote: 22. Appetite of persons in cold climates? What do they require?  Upon what must they rely? Why? The Esquimaux? Laplander? Olive and palm?]    22. Among persons living in cold climates, the appetite for oleaginous food  is especially eager; and they require large quantities of it to enable them  to resist the depressing influences of cold. Since vegetation is scanty and  innutritious, and the waters of the frozen regions abound in animal life,  they must rely wholly upon a diet derived from the latter source. The  Esquimaux consumes daily from ten to fifteen pounds of meat or blubber, a  large proportion of which is fat. The Laplander will drink train-oil, and  regards tallow-candles as a great delicacy. In hot climates, on the  contrary, where flourish the olive {60} and the palm, this kind of food may  be obtained from vegetable sources in abundant quantities.    [Sidenote: 23. Which are the third of the organic groups? What do they  embrace? Points of resemblance?]    23. THE SUGARS, OR THE SACCHARINE SUBSTANCES.--These constitute the third,  and last, group of the organic substances, which are employed as food. This  group embraces, in addition to the different kinds of _Sugar_, the  varieties of starch and gum, from whatever source derived. The two  substances last named do not, at first sight, present many points of  similarity to sugar; but they closely resemble it in respect to their  ultimate chemical composition, being made up of the same elements, in  nearly the same proportions. And their office in the system is the same,  since they are all changed into sugar by the processes of digestion.    [Sidenote: 24. Origin of the sugars? Ordinary sugar? Beetroot? Maple-sugar?  Grape-sugar? Cane-sugar?]    24. SUGAR is chiefly of vegetable origin; the animal varieties being  obtained from honey and milk. The most noticeable characteristic of this  substance is its agreeable, sweet taste, which makes it everywhere a  favorite article of food. But this quality of sweetness is not possessed by  all the varieties of sugar in the same degree; that obtained from milk, for  instance, has a comparatively feeble taste, but rather imparts a gritty  feeling to the tongue. The other important properties of sugar are, its  power to crystallize when evaporated from watery solutions, such as the  juices of many plants; a tendency to ferment, by which process alcohol is  produced; and a ready solubility in water. This latter quality renders it  very easy of digestion, and more so than any other of the saccharine group.  It is computed that the annual production of sugar, in all parts of the  world, is more than one million of tons. The kind of sugar that is in  ordinary use, in this country, is prepared from the juice of the  sugar-cane, which contains eighteen per cent. of sugar. In France it is  manufactured from the {61} beet root, which holds about nine per cent.; the  maple-tree of our climate yields a similar sugar. The sweet taste of fruits  is due to the presence of grape-sugar: the white grains seen on raisins  belong to this variety. Cane-sugar is more soluble than the latter, and has  twice the sweetening power.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--GRANULES OF POTATO STARCH.]    [Sidenote: 25. Starch, how widely distributed? Its qualities? Its  constituents? Its solubility?]    25. STARCH.--This is the most widely distributed of the vegetable  principles. It is tasteless, inodorous, and does not crystallize. It  consists of minute rounded granules, which, under the microscope, reveal a  somewhat uniform structure (Fig. 15). Starch will not dissolve in cold  water, but in boiling water the small grains burst open, and may then be  dissolved and digested.    [Sidenote: 26. How much starch in bread-stuffs? In rice? Unripe fruits?  Ripe fruits?]    26. The bread stuffs, wheat, corn, and rye flours, are more than one-half  starch. Rice, which is the \"staff of life\" to one-third of the human  family, contains eighty per cent. Unripe fruits have much starch in them,  which renders them indigestible when eaten uncooked; for the grains of raw  starch are but slightly acted upon within the body. But, under the potent  chemistry of the sun's ray, this crude material is converted into sugar.  Thus are the fruits prepared by the careful hand of Nature, so that when  ripe they may be freely used without further preparation.    [Sidenote: 27. Gum, where found? Its composition? Gum Arabic?]    27. GUM is commonly found in those articles which {62} also contain starch;  and has the same chemical composition as the latter, but is much less  nutritious. In the East, gum-arabic and similar substances are largely  employed as food. Persons who travel by caravan across vast, sandy deserts,  find such substances well adapted to their wants, since they are not  perishable, and are easily packed and carried.    [Sidenote: 28. The three classes of food principles? What besides? What is  said of them? Name the articles not nutritious.]    28. STIMULATING SUBSTANCES.--The three classes of food-principles already  considered--the Albuminoids, the Fats, and the Sugars--comprise all the  more important organic ingredients of our food. There are, besides, a great  variety of coloring and flavoring matters that stimulate or increase the  appetite for food by appealing to the eye and taste; but they are not  nutritious, and are quickly separated from the truly useful substances, and  do not long remain in the body. Among these may be classed spices, flavors  of fruits, tea, coffee, and vegetable acids.    [Sidenote: 29. What is said of experiments that have been tried?]    29. NECESSITY OF A REGULATED DIET.--A great variety of experiments have  been tried in order to test the relative value of the different nutritive  principles. They have been practised to some extent upon man, but chiefly  upon those inferior animals which require a similar diet to man.    [Sidenote: 30. What has been demonstrated in the first place? Example?  Second demonstration? Example? Give the illustration in relation to  convertibility.]    30. By this means it has been demonstrated that--first, when any one of  these substances is eaten exclusively, the body is imperfectly nourished,  and life is shortened. Dogs fed exclusively upon either albumen, fat, or  sugar, soon die of starvation. Second, a diet long deprived of either of  these principles, is a fertile cause of disease; for example, on  ship-board, where fresh vegetables are not dealt out for a long period,  _scurvy_ becomes prevalent among the sailors. They are, however, to a  certain extent mutually convertible, and thus the missing article is  indirectly supplied. For {63} instance, sugar changes to fat in the body;  and hence, as is well known, the \"hands\" on a sugar plantation grow fat  during the sugar season, by partaking freely of the ripened juices of the  cane.    31. That is the best diet therefore which contains some of each of these  principles, in due proportion; and that is the worst which excludes the  most of them. The cravings and experience of man had unerringly guided him  to a correct regulation of his diet, long before the chemistry of food was  understood; so that his ordinary meals long ago combined these various  principles, the necessity and value of which are now explained.
