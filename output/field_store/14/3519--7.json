We had left the  door open and the McGinnis dog had disappeared.    Never shall I forget the sight we saw or the smell we smelled when we  burst into that kitchen. There on the floor was the McGinnis dog and  what was left of Aunt Susanna's Thanksgiving turkey. As for the smell,  imagine a commingled odor of scorching turnips and burning mince pies,  and you have it.    The dog fled out with a guilty yelp. I groaned and snatched the  turnips off. Kate threw open the oven door and dragged out the pies.  Pies and turnips were ruined as irretrievably as the turkey.    \"Oh, what shall we do?\" I cried miserably. I knew Margaret's chance of  college was gone forever.    \"Do!\" Kate was superb. She didn't lose her wits for a second. \"We'll  go home and borrow the girls' dinner. Quick--there's just ten minutes  before train time. Throw those pies and turnips into this basket--the  turkey too--we'll carry them with us to hide them.\"    I might not be able to evolve an idea like that on the spur of the  moment, but I can at least act up to it when it is presented. Without  a moment's delay we shut the door and ran. As we went I saw the  McGinnis dog licking his chops over in their yard. I have been ashamed  ever since of my feelings toward that dog. They were murderous.  Fortunately I had no time to indulge them.    It is ten minutes walk from the Pinery to our house, but you can run  it in five. Kate and I burst into the kitchen just as Laura and  Margaret were sitting down to dinner. We had neither time nor breath  for explanations. Without a word I grasped the turkey platter and the  turnip tureen. Kate caught one hot mince pie from the oven and whisked  a cold one out of the pantry.    \"We've--got--to have--them,\" was all she said.    I've always said that Laura and Magsie would rise to any occasion.  They saw us carry their Thanksgiving dinner off under their very eyes  and they never interfered by word or motion. They didn't even worry us  with questions. They realized that something desperate had happened  and that the emergency called for deed not words.    \"Aggie,\" gasped Kate behind me as we tore through the birch wood, \"the  border--of these pies--is crimped--differently--from Aunt Susanna's.\"    \"She--won't know--the difference,\" I panted. \"Miranda--Mary--crimps  them.\"    We got back to the Pinery just as the train whistle blew. We had ten  minutes to transfer turkey and turnips to Aunt Susanna's dishes, hide  our own, air the kitchen, and get back our breath. We accomplished it.  When Aunt Susanna and her guests came we were prepared for them: we  were calm--outwardly--and the second mince pie was getting hot in the  oven. It was ready by the time it was needed. Fortunately our turkey  was the same size as Aunt Susanna's, and Laura had cooked a double  supply of turnips, intending to warm them up the next day. Still, all  things considered, Kate and I didn't enjoy that dinner much. We kept  thinking of poor Laura and Magsie at home, dining off potatoes on  Thanksgiving!    But at least Aunt Susanna was satisfied. When Kate and I were washing  the dishes she came out quite beamingly.    \"Well, my dears, I must admit that you made a very good job of the  dinner, indeed. The turkey was done to perfection. As for the mince  pies--well, of course Miranda Mary made them, but she must have had  extra good luck with them, for they were excellent and heated to just  the right degree. You didn't give anything to the McGinnis dog, I  hope?\"    \"No, we didn't give him anything,\" said Kate.    Aunt Susanna did not notice the emphasis.    When we had finished the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen out  of the house and went home. Laura and Margaret were busy painting and  studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we hadn't robbed them  of their dinner. But we had to tell them the whole story before we  even took off our hats.    \"There is a special Providence for children and idiots,\" said Laura  gently. We didn't ask her whether she meant us or Tony McGinnis or  both. There are some things better left in obscurity. I'd have  probably said something much sharper than that if anybody had made off  with my Thanksgiving turkey so unceremoniously.    Aunt Susanna came down the next day and told Margaret that she would  send her to college. Also she commissioned Laura to paint her a  water-color for her dining-room and said she'd pay her five dollars  for it.    Kate and I were rather left out in the cold in this distribution of  favors, but when you come to reflect that Laura and Magsie had really  cooked that dinner, it was only just.    Anyway, Aunt Susanna has never since insinuated that we can't cook,  and that is as much as we deserve.          By Grace of Julius Caesar      Melissa sent word on Monday evening that she thought we had better go  round with the subscription list for cushioning the church pews on  Tuesday. I sent back word that I thought we had better go on Thursday.  I had no particular objection to Tuesday, but Melissa is rather fond  of settling things without consulting anyone else, and I don't believe  in always letting her have her own way. Melissa is my cousin and we  have always been good friends, and I am really very fond of her; but  there's no sense in lying down and letting yourself be walked over. We  finally compromised on Wednesday.    I always have a feeling of dread when I hear of any new church-project  for which money will be needed, because I know perfectly well that  Melissa and I will be sent round to collect for it. People say we seem  to be able to get more than anybody else; and they appear to think  that because Melissa is an unencumbered old maid, and I am an  unencumbered widow, we can spare the time without any inconvenience to  ourselves. Well, we have been canvassing for building funds, and  socials, and suppers for years, but it is needed now; at least, I have  had enough of it, and I should think Melissa has, too.    We started out bright and early on Wednesday morning, for Jersey Cove  is a big place and we knew we should need the whole day. We had to  walk because neither of us owned a horse, and anyway it's more  nuisance getting out to open and shut gates than it is worth while. It  was a lovely day then, though promising to be hot, and our hearts  were as light as could be expected, considering the disagreeable  expedition we were on.    I was waiting at my gate for Melissa when she came, and she looked me  over with wonder and disapproval. I could see she thought I was a fool  to dress up in my second best flowered muslin and my very best hat  with the pale pink roses in it to walk about in the heat and dust; but  I wasn't. All my experience in canvassing goes to show that the better  dressed and better looking you are the more money you'll get--that is,  when it's the men you have to tackle, as in this case. If it had been  the women, however, I would have put on the oldest and ugliest things,  consistent with decency, I had. This was what Melissa had done, as it  was, and she did look fearfully prim and dowdy, except for her front  hair, which was as soft and fluffy and elaborate as usual. I never  could understand how Melissa always got it arranged so beautifully.    Nothing particular happened the first part of the day. Some few  growled and wouldn't subscribe anything, but on the whole we did  pretty well. If it had been a missionary subscription we should have  fared worse; but when it was something touching their own comfort,  like cushioning the pews, they came down handsomely. We reached Daniel  Wilson's by noon, and had to have dinner there. We didn't eat much,  although we were hungry enough--Mary Wilson's cooking is a by-word in  Jersey Cove. No wonder Daniel is dyspeptic; but dyspeptic or not, he  gave us a big subscription for our cushions and told us we looked  younger than ever. Daniel is always very complimentary, and they say  Mary is jealous.    When we left the Wilson's Melissa said, with an air of a woman nerving  herself to a disagreeable duty:    \"I suppose we might as well go to Isaac Appleby's now and get it  over.\"    I agreed with her. I had been dreading that call all day. It isn't a  very pleasant thing to go to a man you have recently refused to marry  and ask him for money; and Melissa and I were both in that  predicament.    Isaac was a well-to-do old bachelor who had never had any notion of  getting married until his sister died in the winter. And then, as soon  as the spring planting was over, he began to look round for a wife. He  came to me first and I said \"No\" good and hard. I liked Isaac well  enough; but I was snug and comfortable, and didn't feel like pulling  up my roots and moving into another lot; besides, Isaac's courting  seemed to me a shade too business-like. I can't get along without a  little romance; it's my nature.    Isaac was disappointed and said so, but intimated that it wasn't  crushing and that the next best would do very well. The next best was  Melissa, and he proposed to her after the decent interval of a  fortnight. Melissa also refused him. I admit I was surprised at this,  for I knew Melissa was rather anxious to marry; but she has always  been down on Isaac Appleby, from principle, because of a family feud  on her mother's side; besides, an old beau of hers, a widower at  Kingsbridge, was just beginning to take notice again, and I suspected  Melissa had hopes concerning him. Finally, I imagine Melissa did not  fancy being second choice.    Whatever her reasons were, she refused poor Isaac, and that finished  his matrimonial prospects as far as Jersey Cove was concerned, for  there wasn't another eligible woman in it--that is, for a man of  Isaac's age. I was the only widow, and the other old maids besides  Melissa were all hopelessly old-maiden.    This was all three months ago, and Isaac had been keeping house for  himself ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#11)"],[1,"of supporting her David almost forgot everything else.    In a few minutes they had passed under the bare, glistening boughs of  the poplars on David's lawn, and for the first time Josephine crossed  the threshold of David Hartley's house.    Years ago, in her girlhood, when the Hartley's lived in the old house  and there were half a dozen girls at home, Josephine had frequently  visited there. All the Hartley girls liked her except Zillah. She and  Zillah never \"got on\" together. When the other girls had married and  gone, Josephine gave up visiting there. She had never been inside the  new house, and she and Zillah had not spoken to each other for years.    Zillah was a sick woman--too sick to be anything but civil to  Josephine. David started at once for the doctor at the Creek, and  Josephine saw that he was well wrapped up before she let him go. Then  she mixed up a mustard plaster for Zillah and sat down by the bedside  to wait.    When Mrs. Tom Sentner came down the next day she found Josephine busy  making flaxseed poultices, with her lips set in a line that betokened  she had made up her mind to some disagreeable course of duty.    \"Zillah has got pneumonia bad,\" she said, in reply to Mrs. Tom's  inquiries. \"The Doctor is here and Mary Bell from the Creek. She'll  wait on Zillah, but there'll have to be another woman here to see to  the work. I reckon I'll stay. I suppose it's my duty and I don't see  who else could be got. You can send Mamie and Jack down to stay at my  house until I can go back. I'll run over every day and keep an eye on  things.\"    At the end of a week Zillah was out of danger. Saturday afternoon  Josephine went over home to see how Mamie and Jack were getting on.  She found Mrs. Tom there, and the latter promptly despatched Jack and  Mamie to the post-office that she might have an opportunity to hear  Josephine's news.    \"I've had an awful week of it, Ida,\" said Josephine solemnly, as she  sat down by the stove and put her feet up on the glowing hearth.    \"I suppose Zillah is pretty cranky to wait on,\" said Mrs. Tom  sympathetically.    \"Oh, it isn't Zillah. Mary Bell looks after her. No, it's the house. I  never lived in such a place of dust and disorder in my born days. I'm  sorrier for David Hartley than I ever was for anyone before.\"    \"I suppose he's used to it,\" said Mrs. Tom with a shrug.    \"I don't see how anyone could ever get used to it,\" groaned Josephine.  \"And David used to be so particular when he was a boy. The minute I  went there the other night I took in that kitchen with a look. I don't  believe the paint has even been washed since the house was built. I  honestly don't. And I wouldn't like to be called upon to swear when  the floor was scrubbed either. The corners were just full of rolls of  dust--you could have shovelled it out. I swept it out next day and I  thought I'd be choked. As for the pantry--well, the less said about  _that_ the better. And it's the same all through the house. You could  write your name on everything. I couldn't so much as clean up. Zillah  was so sick there couldn't be a bit of noise made. I did manage to  sweep and dust, and I cleaned out the pantry. And, of course, I saw  that the meals were nice and well cooked. You should have seen David's  face. He looked as if he couldn't get used to having things clean and  tasty. I darned his socks--he hadn't a whole pair to his name--and  I've done everything I could to give him a little comfort. Not that I  could do much. If Zillah heard me moving round she'd send Mary Bell  out to ask what the matter was. When I wanted to go upstairs I'd have  to take off my shoes and tiptoe up on my stocking feet, so's she  wouldn't know it. And I'll have to stay there another fortnight yet.  Zillah won't be able to sit up till then. I don't really know if I can  stand it without falling to and scrubbing the house from garret to  cellar in spite of her.\"    Mrs. Tom Sentner did not say much to Josephine. To herself she said  complacently:    \"She's sorry for David. Well, I've always heard that pity was akin to  love. We'll see what comes of this.\"    Josephine did manage to live through that fortnight. One morning she  remarked to David at the breakfast table:    \"Well, I think that Mary Bell will be able to attend to the work after  today, David. I guess I'll go home tonight.\"    David's face clouded over.    \"Well, I s'pose we oughtn't to keep you any longer, Josephine. I'm  sure it's been awful good of you to stay this long. I don't know what  we'd have done without you.\"    \"You're welcome,\" said Josephine shortly.    \"Don't go for to walk home,\" said David; \"the snow is too deep. I'll  drive you over when you want to go.\"    \"I'll not go before the evening,\" said Josephine slowly.    David went out to his work gloomily. For three weeks he had been  living in comfort. His wants were carefully attended to; his meals  were well cooked and served, and everything was bright and clean. And  more than all, Josephine had been there, with her cheerful smile and  companionable ways. Well, it was all ended now.    Josephine sat at the breakfast table long after David had gone out.  She scowled at the sugar-bowl and shook her head savagely at the  tea-pot.    \"I'll have to do it,\" she said at last.    \"I'm so sorry for him that I can't do anything else.\"    She got up and went to the window, looking across the snowy field to  her own home, nestled between the grove of firs and the orchard.    \"It's awful snug and comfortable,\" she said regretfully, \"and I've  always felt set on being free and independent. But it's no use. I'd  never have a minute's peace of mind again, thinking of David living  here in dirt and disorder, and him so particular and tidy by nature.  No, it's my duty, plain and clear, to come here and make things  pleasant for him--the pointing of Providence, as you might say. The  worst of it is, I'll have to tell him so myself. He'll never dare to  mention the subject again, after what I said to him that night he  proposed last. I wish I hadn't been so dreadful emphatic. Now I've got  to say it myself if it is ever said. But I'll not begin by quoting  poetry, that's one thing sure!\"    Josephine threw back her head, crowned with its shining braids of  jet-black hair, and laughed heartily. She bustled back to the stove  and poked up the fire.    \"I'll have a bit of corned beef and cabbage for dinner,\" she said,  \"and I'll make David that pudding he's so fond of. After all, it's  kind of nice to have someone to plan and think for. It always did seem  like a waste of energy to fuss over cooking things when there was  nobody but myself to eat them.\"    Josephine sang over her work all day, and David went about his with  the face of a man who is going to the gallows without benefit of  clergy. When he came in to supper at sunset his expression was so  woe-begone that Josephine had to dodge into the pantry to keep from  laughing outright. She relieved her feelings by pounding the dresser  with the potato masher, and then went primly out and took her place at  the table.    The meal was not a success from a social point of view. Josephine was  nervous and David glum. Mary Bell gobbled down her food with her usual  haste, and then went away to carry Zillah hers. Then David said  reluctantly:    \"If you want to go home now, Josephine, I'll hitch up Red Rob and  drive you over.\"    Josephine began to plait the tablecloth. She wished again that she had  not been so emphatic on the occasion of his last proposal. Without  replying to David's suggestion she said crossly (Josephine always  spoke crossly when she was especially in earnest):    \"I want to tell you what I think about Zillah. She's getting better,  but she's had a terrible shaking up, and it's my opinion that she  won't be good for much all winter. She won't be able to do any hard  work, that's certain. If you want my advice, I tell you fair and  square that I think she'd better go off for a visit as soon as she's  fit. She thinks so herself. Clementine wants her to go and stay a  spell with her in town. 'Twould be just the thing for her.\"    \"She can go if she wants to, of course,\" said David dully. \"I can get  along by myself for a spell.\"    \"There's no need of your getting along by yourself,\" said Josephine,  more crossly than ever. \"I'll--I'll come here and keep house for you  if you like.\"    David looked at her uncomprehendingly.    \"Wouldn't people kind of gossip?\" he asked hesitatingly. \"Not but  what--\"    \"I don't see what they'd have to gossip about,\" broke in Josephine,  \"if we were--married.\"    David sprang to his feet with such haste that he almost upset the  table.    \"Josephine, do you mean that?\" he exclaimed.    \"Of course I mean it,\" she said, in a perfectly savage tone. \"Now, for  pity's sake, don't say another word about it just now. I can't discuss  it for a spell. Go out to your work. I want to be alone for awhile.\"    For the first and last time David disobeyed her. Instead of going out,  he strode around the table, caught Josephine masterfully in his arms,  and kissed her. And Josephine, after a second's hesitation, kissed him  in return.          Aunt Philippa and the Men      I knew quite well why Father sent me to Prince Edward Island to visit  Aunt Philippa that summer. He told me he was sending me there \"to  learn some sense\"; and my stepmother, of whom I was very fond, told me  she was sure the sea air would do me a world of good. I did not want  to learn sense or be done a world of good; I wanted to stay in  Montreal and go on being foolish--and make up my quarrel with Mark  Fenwick. Father and Mother did not know anything about this quarrel;  they thought I was still on good terms with him--and that is why they  sent me to Prince Edward Island.    I was very miserable. I did not want to go to Aunt Philippa's. It was  not because I feared it would be dull--for without Mark, Montreal was  just as much of a "]]]
