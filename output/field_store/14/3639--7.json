For this achievement the  State owes him a debt of gratitude.    Thomas Penn was in the extraordinary position of having to govern as  a feudal lord what was virtually a modern community. He was exercising  feudal powers three hundred years after all the reasons for the feudal  system had ceased to exist; and he was exercising those powers and  acquiring by them vast wealth from a people in a new and wild country  whose convictions, both civil and religious, were entirely opposed  to anything like the feudal system. It must certainly be put down as  something to his credit that he succeeded so well as to retain control  both of the political government and his family's increasing wealth down  to the time of the Revolution and that he gave on the whole so little  offense to a high-strung people that in the Revolution they allowed his  family to retain a large part of their land and paid them liberally for  what was confiscated.    The wealth which came to the three brothers they spent after the manner  of the time in country life. John and Richard do not appear to have had  remarkable country seats. But Thomas purchased in 1760 the fine English  estate of Stoke Park, which had belonged to Sir Christopher Hatton of  Queen Elizabeth's time, to Lord Coke, and later to the Cobham family.  Thomas's son John, grandson of the founder, greatly enlarged and  beautified the place and far down into the nineteenth century it was  one of the notable country seats of England. This John Penn also built  another country place called Pennsylvania Castle, equally picturesque  and interesting, on the Isle of Portland, of which he was Governor.        Chapter VI. The French And Indian War    There was no great change in political conditions in Pennsylvania until  about the year 1755. The French in Canada had been gradually developing  their plans of spreading down the Ohio and Mississippi valleys behind  the English colonies. They were at the same time securing alliances with  the Indians and inciting them to hostilities against the English. But  so rapidly were the settlers advancing that often the land could not  be purchased fast enough to prevent irritation and ill feeling. The  Scotch-Irish and Germans, it has already been noted, settled on lands  without the formality of purchase from the Indians. The Government, when  the Indians complained, sometimes ejected the settlers but more often  hastened to purchase from the Indians the land which had been occupied.  \"The Importance of the British Plantations in America,\" published in  1731, describes the Indians as peaceful and contented in Pennsylvania  but irritated and unsettled in those other colonies where they had  usually been ill-treated and defrauded. This, with other evidence,  goes to show that up to that time Penn's policy of fairness and good  treatment still prevailed. But those conditions soon changed, as the  famous Walking Purchase of 1737 clearly indicated.    The Walking Purchase had provided for the sale of some lands along the  Delaware below the Lehigh on a line starting at Wrightstown, a few miles  back from the Delaware not far above Trenton, and running northwest,  parallel with the river, as far as a man could walk in a day and a half.  The Indians understood that this tract would extend northward only to  the Lehigh, which was the ordinary journey of a day and a half. The  proprietors, however, surveyed the line beforehand, marked the trees,  engaged the fastest walkers and, with horses to carry provisions,  started their men at sunrise. By running a large part of the way, at  the end of a day and a half these men had reached a point thirty miles  beyond the Lehigh.    The Delaware Indians regarded this measurement as a pure fraud and  refused to abandon the Minisink region north of the Lehigh. The  proprietors then called in the assistance of the Six Nations of New  York, who ordered the Delawares off the Minisink lands. Though they  obeyed, the Delawares became the relentless enemies of the white man and  in the coming years revenged themselves by massacres and murder. They  also broke the control which the Six Nations had over them, became an  independent nation, and in the French Wars revenged themselves on the  Six Nations as well as on the white men. The congress which convened at  Albany in 1754 was an attempt on the part of the British Government to  settle all Indian affairs in a general agreement and to prevent separate  treaties by the different colonies; but the Pennsylvania delegates, by  various devices of compass courses which the Indians did not understand  and by failing to notify and secure the consent of certain tribes,  obtained a grant of pretty much the whole of Pennsylvania west of the  Susquehanna. The Indians considered this procedure to be another gross  fraud. It is to be noticed that in their dealings with Penn they had  always been satisfied, and that he had always been careful that they  should be duly consulted and if necessary be paid twice over for the  land. But his sons were more economical, and as a result of the shrewd  practices of the Albany purchase the Pennsylvania Indians almost  immediately went over in a body to the French and were soon scalping  men, women, and children among the Pennsylvania colonists. It is a  striking fact, however, that in all the after years of war and rapine  and for generations afterwards the Indians retained the most distinct  and positive tradition of Penn's good faith and of the honesty of all  Quakers. So persistent, indeed, was this tradition among the tribes of  the West that more than a century later President Grant proposed to  put the whole charge of the nation's Indian affairs in the hands of the  Quakers. The first efforts to avert the catastrophe threatened by the  alliance of the red man with the French were made by the provincial  assemblies, which voted presents of money or goods to the Indians to  offset similar presents from the French. The result was, of course, the  utter demoralization of the savages. Bribed by both sides, the Indians  used all their native cunning to encourage the bribers to bid against  each other. So far as Pennsylvania was concerned, feeling themselves  cheated in the first instance and now bribed with gifts, they developed  a contempt for the people who could stoop to such practices. As a  result this contempt manifested itself in deeds hitherto unknown in the  province. One tribe on a visit to Philadelphia killed cattle and robbed  orchards as they passed. The delegates of another tribe, having visited  Philadelphia and received 500 pounds as a present, returned to the  frontier and on their way back for another present destroyed the  property of the interpreter and Indian agent, Conrad Weiser. They felt  that they could do as they pleased. To make matters worse, the Assembly  paid for all the damage done; and having started on this foolish  business, they found that the list of tribes demanding presents rapidly  increased. The Shawanoes and the Six Nations, as well as the Delawares,  were now swarming to this new and convenient source of wealth.    Whether the proprietors or the Assembly should meet this increasing  expense or divide it between them, became a subject of increasing  controversy. It was in these discussions that Thomas Penn, in trying to  keep his family's share of the expense as small as possible, first got  the reputation for closeness which followed him for the rest of his life  and which started a party in the province desirous of having Parliament  abolish the proprietorship and put the province under a governor  appointed by the Crown.    The war with the French of Canada and their Indian allies is of interest  here only in so far as it affected the government of Pennsylvania.  From this point of view it involved a series of contests between the  proprietors and the Crown on the one side and the Assembly on the other.  The proprietors and the Crown took advantage of every military necessity  to force the Assembly into a surrender of popular rights. But the  Assembly resisted, maintaining that they had the same right as the  British Commons of having their money bills received or rejected by the  Governor without amendment. Whatever they should give must be given on  their own terms or not at all; and they would not yield this point to  any necessities of the war.    When Governor Morris asked the Assembly for a war contribution in  1754, they promptly voted 20,000 pounds. This was the same amount that  Virginia, the most active of the colonies in the war, was giving. Other  colonies gave much less; New York, only 5000 pounds, and Maryland 6000  pounds. Morris, however, would not assent to the Assembly's bill unless  it contained a clause suspending its effect until the King's pleasure  was known. This was an attempt to establish a precedent for giving up  the Assembly's charter right of passing laws which need not be submitted  to the King for five years and which in the meantime were valid. The  members of the Assembly very naturally refused to be forced by the  necessities of the war into surrendering one of the most important  privileges the province possessed. It was, they said, as much their duty  to resist this invasion of their rights as to resist the French.    Governor Morris, besides demanding that the supply of 20,000 pounds  should not go into force until the King's pleasure was known, insisted  that the paper money representing it should be redeemable in five years.  This period the Assembly considered too short; the usual time was ten  years. Five years would ruin too many people by foreclosures. Moreover,  the Governor was attempting to dictate the way in which the people  should raise a money supply. He and the King had a right to ask for aid  in war; but it was the right of the colony to use its own methods  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#11)"],[1,"   As a matter of fact and history this was probably the last order General  Sumner received from General Shafter, until the troops of his division  had taken the San Juan hills, as it became impossible to get word to  General Shafter, the trail leading to his head-quarters tent, three miles  in the rear, being blocked by the soldiers of the First and Tenth  dismounted Cavalry, and later, by Lawton's division.  General Sumner led  the Sixth, Third, and Ninth Cavalry and the Rough Riders down the trail,  with instructions for the First and Tenth to follow.  The trail, virgin  as yet from the foot of an American soldier, was as wide as its narrowest  part, which was some ten feet across.  At places it was as wide as  Broadway, but only for such short distances that it was necessary for the  men to advance in column, in double file.  A maze of underbrush and trees  on either side was all but impenetrable, and when the officers and men  had once assembled into the basin, they could only guess as to what lay  before them, or on either flank.  At the end of a mile the country became  more open, and General Sumner saw the Spaniards intrenched a half-mile  away on the sloping hills.  A stream, called the San Juan River, ran  across the trail at this point, and another stream crossed it again two  hundred yards farther on.  The troops were halted at this first stream,  some crossing it, and others deploying in single file to the right.  Some  were on the banks of the stream, others at the edge of the woods in the  bushes.  Others lay in the high grass which was so high that it stopped  the wind, and so hot that it almost choked and suffocated those who lay  in it.    The enemy saw the advance and began firing with pitiless accuracy into  the jammed and crowded trail and along the whole border of the woods.  There was not a single yard of ground for a mile to the rear which was  not inside the zone of fire.  Our men were ordered not to return the fire  but to lie still and wait for further orders.  Some of them could see the  rifle-pits of the enemy quite clearly and the men in them, but many saw  nothing but the bushes under which they lay, and the high grass which  seemed to burn when they pressed against it.  It was during this period  of waiting that the greater number of our men were killed.  For one hour  they lay on their rifles staring at the waving green stuff around them,  while the bullets drove past incessantly, with savage insistence, cutting  the grass again and again in hundreds of fresh places.  Men in line  sprang from the ground and sank back again with a groan, or rolled to one  side clinging silently to an arm or shoulder.  Behind the lines hospital  stewards passed continually, drawing the wounded back to the streams,  where they laid them in long rows, their feet touching the water's edge  and their bodies supported by the muddy bank.  Up and down the lines, and  through the fords of the streams, mounted aides drove their horses at a  gallop, as conspicuous a target as the steeple on a church, and one after  another paid the price of his position and fell from his horse wounded or  dead.  Captain Mills fell as he was giving an order, shot through the  forehead behind both eyes; Captain O'Neill, of the Rough Riders, as he  said, \"There is no Spanish bullet made that can kill me.\"  Steel, Swift,  Henry, each of them was shot out of his saddle.    Hidden in the trees above the streams, and above the trail,  sharp-shooters and guerillas added a fresh terror to the wounded.  There  was no hiding from them.  Their bullets came from every side.  Their  invisible smoke helped to keep their hiding-places secret, and in the  incessant shriek of shrapnel and the spit of the Mausers, it was  difficult to locate the reports of their rifles.  They spared neither the  wounded nor recognized the Red Cross; they killed the surgeons and the  stewards carrying the litters, and killed the wounded men on the litters.  A guerilla in a tree above us shot one of the Rough Riders in the breast  while I was helping him carry Captain Morton Henry to the  dressing-station, the ball passing down through him, and a second shot,  from the same tree, barely missed Henry as he lay on the ground where we  had dropped him.  He was already twice wounded and so covered with blood  that no one could have mistaken his condition.  The surgeons at work  along the stream dressed the wounds with one eye cast aloft at the trees.  It was not the Mauser bullets they feared, though they passed  continuously, but too high to do their patients further harm, but the  bullets of the sharp-shooters which struck fairly in among them,  splashing in the water and scattering the pebbles.  The sounds of the two  bullets were as different as is the sharp pop of a soda-water bottle from  the buzzing of an angry wasp.    For a time it seemed as though every second man was either killed or  wounded; one came upon them lying behind the bush, under which they had  crawled with some strange idea that it would protect them, or crouched  under the bank of the stream, or lying on their stomachs and lapping up  the water with the eagerness of thirsty dogs.  As to their suffering, the  wounded were magnificently silent, they neither complained nor groaned  nor cursed.    \"I've got a punctured tire,\" was their grim answer to inquiries.  White  men and colored men, veterans and recruits and volunteers, each lay  waiting for the battle to begin or to end so that he might be carried  away to safety, for the wounded were in as great danger after they were  hit as though they were in the firing line, but none questioned nor  complained.    I came across Lieutenant Roberts, of the Tenth Cavalry, lying under the  roots of a tree beside the stream with three of his colored troopers  stretched around him.  He was shot through the intestines, and each of  the three men with him was shot in the arm or leg.  They had been  overlooked or forgotten, and we stumbled upon them only by the accident  of losing our way.  They had no knowledge as to how the battle was going  or where their comrades were or where the enemy was.  At any moment, for  all they knew, the Spaniards might break through the bushes about them.  It was a most lonely picture, the young lieutenant, half naked, and wet  with his own blood, sitting upright beside the empty stream, and his  three followers crouching at his feet like three faithful watch-dogs,  each wearing his red badge of courage, with his black skin tanned to a  haggard gray, and with his eyes fixed patiently on the white lips of his  officer.  When the white soldiers with me offered to carry him back to  the dressing-station, the negroes resented it stiffly.  \"If the  Lieutenant had been able to move, we would have carried him away long  ago,\" said the sergeant, quite overlooking the fact that his arm was  shattered.    \"Oh, don't bother the surgeons about me,\" Roberts added, cheerfully.  \"They must be very busy.  I can wait.\"    As yet, with all these killed and wounded, we had accomplished  nothing--except to obey orders--which was to await further orders.  The  observation balloon hastened the end.  It came blundering down the trail,  and stopped the advance of the First and Tenth Cavalry, and was sent up  directly over the heads of our men to observe what should have been  observed a week before by scouts and reconnoitring parties.  A balloon,  two miles to the rear, and high enough in the air to be out of range of  the enemy's fire may some day prove itself to be of use and value.  But a  balloon on the advance line, and only fifty feet above the tops of the  trees, was merely an invitation to the enemy to kill everything beneath  it.  And the enemy responded to the invitation.  A Spaniard might  question if he could hit a man, or a number of men, hidden in the bushes,  but had no doubt at all as to his ability to hit a mammoth glistening  ball only six hundred yards distant, and so all the trenches fired at it  at once, and the men of the First and Tenth, packed together directly  behind it, received the full force of the bullets.  The men lying  directly below it received the shrapnel which was timed to hit it, and  which at last, fortunately, did hit it.  This was endured for an hour, an  hour of such hell of fire and heat, that the heat in itself, had there  been no bullets, would have been remembered for its cruelty.  Men gasped  on their backs, like fishes in the bottom of a boat, their heads burning  inside and out, their limbs too heavy to move.  They had been rushed here  and rushed there wet with sweat and wet with fording the streams, under a  sun that would have made moving a fan an effort, and they lay prostrate,  gasping at the hot air, with faces aflame, and their tongues sticking  out, and their eyes rolling.  All through this the volleys from the  rifle-pits sputtered and rattled, and the bullets sang continuously like  the wind through the rigging in a gale, shrapnel whined and broke, and  still no order came from General Shafter.    Captain Howse, of General Sumner's staff, rode down the trail to learn  what had delayed the First and Tenth, and was hailed by Colonel Derby,  who was just descending from the shattered balloon.    \"I saw men up there on those hills,\" Colonel Derby shouted; \"they are  firing at our troops.\"  That was part of the information contributed by  the balloon.  Captain Howse's reply is lost to history.    General Kent's division, which, according to the plan, was to have been  held in reserve, had been rushed up in the rear of the First and Tenth,  and the Tenth had deployed in skirmish order to the right.  The trail was  now completely blocked by Kent's division.  Lawton's division, which was  to have re-enforced on the right, had not appeared, but incessant firing  from the direction of El Caney showed that he and Chaffee were fighting  mightily.  The situation was desperate.  Our troops could not"]]]
