The stems  of trees are tapered upward; and the columns of Grecian architecture,  having been taken from them, and therefore retaining a degree of analogy  with them, were tapered upward too: but the legs of animals are tapered  downward, and the inverted obelisks, upon which busts were placed, having  a similar analogy to them, were tapered downward also; while pilasters,  which had no analogy with either, but were mere square posts terminating a  wall, never tapered at all.\"    Speaking of beauty generally, and without seeing the distinctions I have  made above, Burke, on the contrary, states the first quality of beauty to  be comparative smallness, and says: \"In ordinary conversation, it is usual  to add the endearing name of little to everything we love;\" and \"in most  languages, the objects of love are spoken of under diminutive epithets.\"    This is evidently true only of the objects of _minor_ or _subordinate  beauty_, which Burke confusedly thought the only kind of it, though he  elsewhere grants, that beauty may be connected with sublimity! It shows,  however, that relative littleness is essential to that first kind of  beauty.    With greater knowledge of facts than Burke possessed, and with as feeble  reasoning powers, but with less taste, and with a perverse whimsicality  which was all his own, Payne Knight similarly, making no distinction in  beauty, considered smallness as an accidental association, failed to see  that it characterized a kind of beauty, and argued, that \"if we join the  diminutive to a term which precludes all such affection, or does not even,  in some degree, express it, it immediately converts it into a term of  contempt and reproach: thus, a bantling, a fondling, a darling, &c., are  terms of endearment; but a witling, a changeling, a lordling, &c., are  invariably terms of scorn: so in French, '_mon petit enfant_,' is an  expression of endearment; but '_mon petit monsieur_,' is an expression of  the most pointed reproach and contempt.\"    Now, this chatter of grammatical termination and French phrase, though  meant to look vastly clever, is merely a blunder. There is no analogy in  the cases compared: a \"darling\" or little dear unites _dear_, an  expression of love, with _little_, implying that dependance which enhances  love; while \"witling\" or little wit unites _wit_, an expression of talent,  with _little_, meaning the small quantity or absence of the talent alluded  to; and it is because the latter term means, not physical littleness,  which well associates with love, but moral littleness and mental  degradation, that it becomes a term of contempt.    Even from the little already said, it seems evident that much of the  confusion on this subject has arisen from not distinguishing the two  genera of beauty, and not seeing that \"the emotion of grandeur\" is merely  \"a branch of the emotion of beauty.\"    The other genus of beauty, _grand_ or _sublime beauty_, is well described  by the names given to it, grandeur or sublimity. Some have considered  sublimity as expressing grandeur in the highest degree: it would perhaps  be as well to express the cause of the emotion by grandeur, and the  emotion itself by sublimity.    Nothing is sublime that is not vast or powerful, or that does not make him  who feels it sensible of its physical or moral superiority.    The simplest cause of sublimity is presented by all objects of vast  magnitude or extent--a seemingly boundless plain, the sky, the ocean,  &c.; and the particular direction of the magnitude or extent always  correspondingly modifies the emotion--height giving more especially the  idea of power, breadth of resistance, depth of danger, &c. Of the objects  mentioned above, the ocean is the most sublime, because, to vastness in  length and breadth, it adds depth, and a force perpetually active.    Now, that these objects, though sublime, are beautiful, is very evident;  and it is therefore also evident how much Burke erred in asserting  comparative smallness to be the first character of beauty generally  considered. This and similar errors, as already said, have greatly  obscured this subject, and have led Burke and others so to modify and  qualify their doctrines, as to take from them all precision and certainty.    Hence, in one place, Burke says: \"As, in the animal world, and in a good  measure in the vegetable world likewise, the qualities that constitute  _beauty_ may _possibly_ be united to things of _greater dimensions_ [that  is, littleness may be united with bigness!]; when they are so united they  constitute _a species something different both from the sublime and  beautiful_, which I have before called, Fine.\"    So also he says: \"Ugliness I imagine likewise to be consistent enough with  an idea of the sublime. But I would by no means insinuate that ugliness of  itself is a sublime idea, unless united with such qualities as excite a  strong terror.\"    Here, he confounds sublimity with terror, as do Blair and other writers,  when they say that \"exact proportion of parts, though it enters often  into the beautiful, is much disregarded in the sublime.\" It is a fact,  that exactly in proportion as ugliness is substituted for beauty in vast  objects, is sublimity taken away, until at last it is utterly lost in the  terrible.    Even Blair shows that sublimity may exist without terror or pain. \"The  proper sensation of sublimity appears,\" he observes, \"to be  distinguishable from the sensation of either of these, and, on several  occasions, to be entirely separated from them. In many grand objects,  there is no coincidence with terror at all; as in the magnificent prospect  of wide-extended plains, and of the starry firmament; or in the moral  dispositions and sentiments, which we view with high admiration; and in  many painful and terrible objects also, it is clear, there is no sort of  grandeur. The amputation of a limb, or the bite of a snake, is exceedingly  terrible, but is destitute of all claim whatever to sublimity.\"    Payne Knight shows that terror is even opposed to sublimity: \"All the  great and terrible convulsions of nature; such as storms, tempests,  hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, &c., excite sublime ideas, and impress  sublime sentiments by the prodigious exertions of energy and power which  they seem to display: for though these objects are, in their nature,  terrible, and generally known to be so, it is not this attribute of terror  that contributes, in the smallest degree to render them sublime.... Timid  women fly to a cellar, or a darkened room, to avoid the sublime effects of  a thunder-storm; because to them they are not sublime, but terrible. To  those only are they sublime, '_qui formidine nulla imbuti spectant_,' who  behold them without any fear at all; and to whom, therefore, they are in  no degree terrible.\"    This farther confirms the distinction which I made of beauty into minor or  subordinate, and grand or sublime beauty, although Knight adopted other  principles, if principles they may be called, and neglected such  distinction.    There is but one other error on this subject which I need to notice. Burke  says: \"To make anything very terrible, obscurity seems in general to be  necessary. When we know the full extent of any danger, when we can  accustom our eyes to it, a great deal of the apprehension vanishes. Every  one will be sensible of this, who considers how greatly night adds to our  dread, in all cases of danger.... Those despotic governments which are  founded on the passions of men, and principally upon the passion of fear,  keep their chief as much as may be from the public eye. The policy has  been the same in many cases of religion. Almost all the heathen temples  were dark.\"    From what has already been said, it is evident that all this contributes  to terror, not to sublimity; and that the same error is made by Blair when  he says, \"As obscurity, so disorder, too, is very compatible with  grandeur, nay, frequently heightens it.\"    To expose the weakness and to destroy the authority of some writers on  this subject, can only set the mind free for the investigation of truth.  I may, therefore, conclude this chapter by quoting the shrewd remarks of  Knight on some of the principles of Burke. I shall afterward be forced  critically to examine the notions of Knight in their turn.    Burke states that the highest degree of sublime sensation is astonishment;  and the subordinate degrees, awe, reverence, and respect; all which he  considers as modes of terror. And Knight observes that this graduated  scale of the sublime, from respect to astonishment, cannot, perhaps be  better illustrated than by applying it to his own character.    \"He was certainly,\" says Knight, \"a very respectable man, and reverenced  by all who knew him intimately. At one period of his life, too, when he  became the disinterested patron of remote and injured nations, who had  none to help them, his character was truly sublime; but, unless upon those  whom he so ably and eloquently arraigned, I do not believe that it  impressed any awe.... If, during this period, he had suddenly appeared  among the managers in Westminster Hall without his wig and coat, or had  walked up St. James's street without his breeches, it would have  occasioned great and universal astonishment; and if he had, at the same  time, carried a loaded blunderbuss in his hands, the astonishment would  have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#11)"],[1,"th; first upper row shorter; first and  third upper rows interrupted medially; first lower row interrupted  medially, equal in length to second and third upper rows; second lower  row slightly shorter; third lower row shortest.    Body mottled brown and creamy gray above and below; mouth colored like  body; caudal musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent; dark  brown streak mid-laterally on anterior third of caudal musculature;  rest of tail and all of caudal fin heavily flecked with brown; eye red  in life.    _Variation._--The third upper tooth-row is interrupted in all  specimens; in some individuals the first upper and first lower rows  are complete. The variation in size and proportions is given in Table  2. The dark brown lateral streak on the anterior part of the caudal  musculature is distinct on most specimens; the only other variation in  coloration is in the amount of brown flecking on the caudal  musculature and fin.    _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ differs from _P.  schmidtorum chamulae_ as stated in the diagnosis and in having pale  creamy tan, as opposed to dark brown, webbing on the feet; and from  _P. ignicolor_ in having a depressed, as opposed to a flat,  internarial region. Tadpoles of _P. s. schmidtorum_ have a mottled  appearance, as opposed to the more uniform brown color of _P. s.  chamulae_.    _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ and several species of  _Plectrohyla_ are sympatric. All species of the latter genus have a  bony prepollex, rugose skin on the dorsum, and heavy body; also  sympatric is _Ptychohyla e. euthysanota_, which has a tarsal fold and  in breeding males spinous nuptial tuberosities.    _Life History._--This species breeds in clear mountain streams where  males call from vegetation along the stream. The call consists of  series of short notes, three to nine notes per series, sounding like  \"raa-raa-raa.\" The duration of each note is approximately .065 of a  second, and has a rate of 96 to 119 pulses per second; the dominant  frequency is about 3400 cycles per second. The call is almost  indistinguishable from that of _Ptychohyla schmidtorum chamulae_.    Tadpoles and metamorphosing young were found at Finca La Paz,  Guatemala, in late July, 1960. Two young lacking tails but not having  completely developed mouths have snout-vent lengths of 14.2 and 14.6  mm. L. C. Stuart collected four metamorphosing young at Finca La Paz  on May 6, 1949. By May 10 the frogs were completely metamorphosed, at  which time they had snout-vent lengths of 15.5 to 17.0 (average 16.1)  mm.    _Remarks._--There is no doubt that this frog is most closely related  to _Ptychohyla schmidtorum chamulae_, even though the ranges of the  two subspecies are separated by the interior depression of Chiapas.  Since at least at Finca La Paz, Guatemala, _P. s. schmidtorum_ occurs  with _P. e. euthysanota_, it is surprising that the former species has  not been found at more localities along the Pacific slopes on northern  Central America. At Finca La Paz in July, 1960, _P. s. schmidtorum_  was more abundant than _P. e. euthysanota_.    _Distribution._--This species is known only from a limited area at  elevations between 1300 and 2200 meters on the Pacific slopes of the  Sierra Madre in extreme eastern Chiapas and western Guatemala.    _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Chiapas_: Finca Irlandia, UMMZ  105429-30.
