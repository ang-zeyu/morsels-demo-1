I  don't remember many of the technical names though,\" she added honestly.  \"That just happened to be one that I knew. See! there goes a Copper.\"    Every step through the clover displaced myriads of small butterflies  with wings of some shade of coppery-red or orange. Dappled fritillaries  and angle wings, blocked in red and black, often variegated by odd  dashes and spots of burnished silver or peacock eyes, crowded about the  spreading thistle blossoms, or perched contentedly upon the many  flowered umbrels of the milkweed.    \"Then that is how you knew about protective mimicry?\" asked he, after  commenting upon the butterfly pointed out by Bee.    \"Yes.\" Beatrice laughed more gaily than she had for days as she noted  his pleased expression. \"He likes it because I studied them,\" she told  herself gleefully.    \"And that one passing yonder. The one with the zigzag flight, my  daughter. That is a Skipper, is it not?\"    Beatrice turned a look of surprise upon him.    \"Why, father! that is a Swallowtail,\" she cried. \"How could you make  such a--\" She broke into a laugh suddenly as she saw his eyes twinkle.  \"You were just trying to see if I knew,\" she cried.    \"I'm afraid that I shall have to admit it,\" he said. \"Have you any  specimens?\"    \"A few, father. Some Swallowtails, some Brush-footed ones, a number of  Blues, Coppers and Hair-streaks.\"    \"Why! you are quite a lepidopterist,\" exclaimed Doctor Raymond. \"And the  eggs, the larvae and the chrysalids; do you have them too?\"    The girl hung her head.    \"N-no; I know one has to have those things as well as the butterflies to  study the science properly, but I have none. I think the butterflies are  beautiful. Just like flying flowers!\"    \"Ah! you are like all amateurs, Beatrice.\" Doctor Raymond shook his head  gravely. \"They are taken by the beauty of the butterfly, and so confine  themselves to the imago state entirely. Whereas, to know the insect  thoroughly, one should study it from the egg through all its stages to  the perfected form. But you are not alone in it, my daughter. There are  many men of wealth who make collections of the butterfly, as they do of  gems and other things. They, too, care only for the perfected insect.  In your case, you are young, and may be taught the proper manner of  study. I am glad that you are interested in such things. It will afford  me great pleasure to continue your instruction in the subject this  summer. That is, if you would like it?\"    \"Like it?\" cried Beatrice, looking up at him with unfeigned delight. \"I  should love it.\"    \"Then we will consider that matter settled,\" he said with approval.  \"Here are some wild cherry trees. Be careful, child! There are some  wasps.\"    But Beatrice, intent upon making herself useful, rushed forward eagerly  and began stripping off the leaves from the low hanging limbs.    \"Do you want some of the twigs, father? There is a fine branch here  filled with leaves.\"    \"Yes; but let me cut it for you.\" Doctor Raymond drew out a clasp knife  and started to open it.    \"I can get it quite easily, thank you, father,\" said Bee, bending the  bough which broke suddenly with a sharp snap, disturbing a wasp that had  just settled comfortably on one of the twigs. With an angry buzz the  insect darted at the girl's hand, and thrust its sting into the  offending member.    \"Oh!\" she uttered, letting the branch fall and clasping her hand  quickly.    \"You are stung,\" cried Doctor Raymond. \"Give me your hand. At once!\"    He caught up some of the damp earth and clapped it on the wound, holding  the mud in place.    \"Does it hurt so much now?\" he asked after a moment, binding his  handkerchief closely about the hand.    Beatrice's eyes shone through her tears. He cared because she was hurt.  A warm glow suffused her being, and nestled comfortingly about her  heart. She looked up and smiled.    \"Hurt?\" she exclaimed. \"Nonsense! what is an old yellow jacket but a bee  gone into athletics!\"    An expression of pleased surprise shot athwart her father's face and his  chuckle gave way to a peal of laughter.    \"That is neat, child,\" he said. \"Very neat! I like your way of taking  this. You have the true spirit of a naturalist who accepts such  happenings as a matter of experience. Are you fearful or timid? Do you  get frightened easily?\"    \"I am not afraid of creeping things,\" answered Beatrice thoughtfully. \"I  don't believe that I know about other things. There has never been much  to try me. At least, there never was anything until I saw those burglars  the other night. I was scared then.\"    \"You saw those men?\" ejaculated Doctor Raymond. \"Where did you see  them?\"    \"I forgot that you did not know, father.\"    \"But I wish to know. Tell me all about it, Beatrice.\"    \"It was the first night that I wore that horrid poultice for my  complexion. I could not sleep, so I went down stairs to get a book from  the library, and when I opened the door there were the two burglars  putting the silver into a bag. I was so scared that I could not do  anything but look at them. When they saw me they took me for a ghost and  ran away. I did look scary, father; so, when I heard you coming, I hid  under the couch because I did not want you to see me. When Aunt Fanny  was left alone I came out and ran up to my room. Yes; I was frightened.  I shook like a leaf after it was all over, and I was glad that you were  going to be near me.\"    \"I see, my daughter. There was reason for fear in that instance. Few  girls would have done so well. I have not spoken of the matter before  because I did not wish to alarm you, and I did not know that you knew of  their visit. However, they will hardly bother us again as the  authorities are keeping a sharp watch for them, and believe that they  will soon have them in custody. I shall take that room next yours for  mine permanently, I think. Perhaps you will feel a little safer to have  me there, and there is no one on that side of the hall with you. Is it  somewhat too remote for you? Come, child! It is time to get back and get  some soda on that sting.\"          Chapter IX    With the Butterflies        \"These be the pretty genis of the flowers,      Daintily fed with honey and pure dew.\"        --_Hood._      The windows of the study were thrown wide to the breeze which came cool  and fresh from the shrubberies laden with the odors of the garden. It  was a cozy, old-fashioned room, plainly furnished, but with that most  welcome adornment to lovers of letters--a multitude of books. A large,  open fireplace, surmounted by a high mantel-piece, took up nearly the  whole of one side of the room; before this was a writing table upon  which were scattered books, pamphlets, letters, scraps of manuscript,  blank paper, pens and inkstands; by no means primly arranged.    Three weeks had passed since Beatrice had taken her first walk with her  father. That walk had been followed by others until now she accompanied  him as a matter of course. Each day also she had gone to him for a time  to study butterflies, and recently she had begun to help him catalogue  his specimens. On this day father and daughter were in the study hard at  work.    \"There, child,\" remarked Doctor Raymond, laying aside his manuscript. \"I  think you have done enough for one day.\"    \"I am not one bit tired,\" protested Bee eagerly. \"I could work for hours  yet.\"    \"You are a delightful helper, Beatrice,\" commented he smilingly. \"You  are so willing and zealous; but for that very reason I must guard  against your enthusiasm carrying you too far.\"    Beatrice flushed with gratification. It seemed to her that her father  was really beginning to care for her. He had several times uttered words  of commendation, and she knew that he was pleased with her application  to study.    \"If you wish you may go to the laboratory with me,\" continued her  father. \"There are several butterflies that should come out of their  chrysalids today. You may be interested in seeing them. Then we will go  for a walk.\"    \"I should like to see them,\" cried Bee rising. \"Are they rare specimens,  father?\"    \"A few of them are. They are all European butterflies. The one specimen  in all my collection that I prize the most highly is the pupa of the  Teinopalpus imperialis--an Asiatic butterfly. It is found in the forests  of Sikkin, and also in Central China, but is very rare. In fact, if this  one of mine comes out all right it will be the only one of its kind in  any collection. I have retarded the development of the chrysalis by cold  until the present time. It is a magnificent butterfly, and I am  anxiously waiting its coming out. Then there will be something to see,  Beatrice. Still, while not so rare, these will be quite interesting, so  we will go to see them.\"    The laboratory which joined the study was a large room with glass on two  sides, fitted out with both a heating apparatus and a refrigerating  process. Cabinets with glass-covered drawers filled with butterflies in  all stages of development, from the egg to the perfect insect, lined one  side of the apartment. Another side was fitted with shelves which were  filled with drying ovens, breeding cages, field boxes, poison jars,  setting boards, and all the paraphernalia of a naturalist. Twigs,  branches of trees and leaves jutted out from artificial crevices on  some of which innumerable caterpillars were feeding; on others the  chrysalids had already formed, and hung awaiting the moment when they  should be released from their sleep.    It was not a room that many girls would enjoy, but to Beatrice Raymond  it was filled with charm. She was truly interested in the marvel of the  evolution of the butterfly, and through that interest had overcome her  natural repugnance to the caterpillar from which it came. Added to this  was the growing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#11)"],[1," the  hands of his son, a lad of about fourteen, who accompanied him, he  armed himself with a _rifle_, which is a gun made on purpose for  throwing bullets very accurately, to a long distance. He left all his  dogs at home, thinking they would be of more harm than use.    Harvey and his boy had already been some hours in the wood, and were  beginning to think that they had received false information, when young  Dick, who was a remarkably sagacious, intelligent fellow, suddenly  stopped his father, and pointed to some trees at a little distance.    \"Well, lad,\" whispered Harvey, \"what dost see now?\"    \"Look at those squirrels, father!\"    \"I see 'em plain enough, but it won't do. Though if it wasn't for  master's orders, I should like to try the rifle upon one of 'em, I must  say.\"    \"No, no, father,\" replied Dick, \"that isn't what I mean. But only look  at them! They aint eating, nor doing nothing, but they have all got  their heads one way, and they stick themselves up as if they were  frightened at something. Depend upon it, father, the wild-cat isn't far  from those squirrels, if she is in the wood at all.\"    \"_I see!_\" replied his father: \"that's as bright a thought as ever came  into thy head, son Dick! But we have no chance among these plaguy thick  bushes. We must creep quietly out into the path, and then perhaps we  may get a shot at the varmint.\"    So the two cat-hunters concealed themselves behind a tree, by the side  of the path, and just as the wild-cat was pouncing upon her prey, a  ball from the keeper's well-directed rifle laid her howling upon the  ground, with the bone of her hind-leg smashed to atoms.    But he who supposes that one of these ferocious animals is conquered  merely because her leg is broken, will find himself very much mistaken.  A wild-cat conquered! no, indeed! You may kill her, but she _never  yields_, so long as she has any life remaining. And so Harvey found to  his cost. For when he saw the animal rolling upon the ground, supposing  her to be mortally wounded, he ran up towards her, intending to finish  the affair with a blow from the butt end of his rifle. Now this  imprudent conduct proved that he had never encountered a wounded  wild-cat before. No sooner had he approached within a few yards of her,  than, regardless of her broken leg, she sprang upon him like a fury,  and before he could aim a blow at her, she was at his throat, with her  fore-legs clasped round his neck.    Frightful! only imagine the horrors of such an embrace! In vain poor  Harvey strove with all his might to cast off the savage creature from  him, and I cannot tell how the affair might have ended, if Dick had not  been at hand to render assistance. Waiting for a favourable opportunity,  he put the muzzle of his gun close to the creature's body, and firing  both barrels at once, in his eagerness to do the business effectually,  he made such a terrible hole in her side, that, if she had had nine  hundred lives, instead of the usual moderate number of nine, they would  all have taken flight through the wound in an instant. She fell to the  ground, a mangled, blackened corpse.    And how did poor Harvey escape? Better than could have been expected,  considering the powerful teeth and claws of his adversary. To be sure,  he was pretty severely bitten and scratched, but his wounds were not  dangerous; and when he had recovered his breath, and wiped the blood  from his face, the first thing he did was to stretch his vanquished foe  at her full length upon the ground. Then laying his rifle by her side,  he said to Dick, \"She's full four feet long, if she's an inch, and I  have gained my wager! I laid a bet of a guinea, with Lord  What's-his-name's keeper, that she would turn out to be four feet long,  and so she is, and more, as I can tell by the length of this barrel.  But only look at her teeth, Dick, and her terrible claws!\"    \"And what a great bushy tail!\" said Dick, rubbing it through his hands;  \"and see, father, 'tis the same size from end to end, and quite black  at the tip, just as that learned stranger gentleman up at the hall said  that all real wild-cats were.\"    \"A learned gentleman! Let me tell thee, son Dick, if thee hadst had thy  face and hands clawed to pieces like mine are, thee wouldst have said  the varmint was _wild_ enough, in all conscience, without waiting for  any _learned gentleman_ to tell thee so. How my face do smart to be  sure! And look at my new jacket! All burnt and torn to pieces! 'T was a  wonder my arm wasn't blown off too. Well, boy, 't was a bold shot, and  I can't tell what I should have done if somebody hadn't been by. But  come, throw the beast over thy shoulder. I must go home and get mother  to put some plaister on these bites and scratches.\"    At the very beginning of this fierce conflict, all the squirrels,  except the father of the family, fled from the scene of action, and in  five minutes they were safe in the nest. But Brush was so determined to  see the end of the affair, that he remained concealed in the  hazel-tree, till Dick had fired the finishing shot; and then, being  convinced that he had nothing more to fear from his old enemy, he  scampered off to his home, to relate what he had seen.          CHAPTER VIII.      I have not much more to tell you about \"Squirrels and other Animals,\"  for by the time the tenants of the oak-tree had collected a good stock  of provisions, the weather had become rather cold and dismal, and it  seemed likely that the winter would set in very early that year. But  the time for their long sleep was not yet quite arrived, and on fine  days they were still to be seen abroad, roaming about from tree to  tree, and sometimes bringing home a few more nuts and acorns. But to  find these they were now obliged to search on the ground, for the wind  had shaken the ripe fruit from the trees. Now they were relieved from  the dread of being seized by their terrible enemy, they could ramble  about where they pleased.    One day as they were rummaging about among the dry leaves, under the  hazel-bushes, the squirrels fell in with the very oddest creature they  had ever seen. They had heard from Leatherwing that such an animal  lived in the woods, but they did not think they should ever meet with  him, as the bat had told them that he never came abroad till it was  dark. But the old fellow was mistaken a little for once in his life,  for here this most extraordinary looking creature certainly was, in the  middle of the day.[11] From the description Brush had received of this  animal, he knew at once that he was one _Touchmenot_, a hedgehog; and  that though he was considered to be rather a queer-tempered fellow, he  was not likely to do him any harm. But the young squirrels and their  mother were so frightened at his very warlike appearance, that they  leaped up into the bushes overhead.          [11] I can bear witness, that hedgehogs are not always nocturnal        animals, having more than once seen them running about in the        daytime, and I remember capturing one that was trotting across        the corner of a field when the mid-day sun was shining brightly.        And if the hedgehog occasionally kills snakes, as Mr. Bell        informs us, how can he meet with these animals by night, when        they are invariably safe in their holes?    [Illustration: THE SQUIRREL AND THE HEDGEHOG. Page 189.]    Brush remained on the ground, but his family observed that he took care  to keep close to the stem of a small tree, for he thought that if his  new acquaintance should become uncivil, he could not possibly climb up  after him. After the two animals had looked at each other for some time  in silence, Touchmenot began the conversation.                     *       *       *       *       *    TOUCHMENOT.    Well! what d'ye stare at? What d'ye want? Never saw me before, eh? Hope  you will remember me when we meet again, for you have looked at me long  enough, I am sure, with those great black eyes of yours.    Oh! don't be frightened! You may stare at me till you are blind for all  I care. I'm not ashamed of myself. Oh dear no! Well, now you have  examined me pretty well, who d'ye think I am, eh?    BRUSH,    (_Rather frightened at the surly address of the stranger_).    I believe you are called Mr. Touchmenot, are you not, Sir?    TOUCHMENOT.    Touchmenot, indeed! What fool told you that? Well, I don't care, they  may call me so if they please. Ha! ha! no bad name neither! _Touch me  not_, I advise you, or you will smart for it! So _that's_ the name they  give me, is it? Oh, with all my heart! And what else have you heard  about me, Mr. Greateyes?    BRUSH.    Oh, nothing very particular. Yes, now I recollect, I have heard that  you have got a very odd way of defending yourself, by rolling up into a  ball, when you see any animal coming that you think is an enemy.    TOUCHMENOT.    That I _think_ is an enemy? I consider _all_ animals my enemies. Except  my own family, I don't believe I have a friend in the world. My comfort  is, that I am very well able to take care of myself; and yet I can  neither fly like a bird, nor run like a hare, nor swim like a fish, nor  leap like yourself. No, I can do none of these; but I can _roll up_,  and so set all my enemies at defiance; and I had half a mind to have  done so when I first saw you, but it was hardly worth while, for you  are much smaller than I am, and, besides, to tell you the truth, you  look rather like a good-tempered fellow. Now what other tales have you  heard about my doings?    BRUSH.    Why if you wont be angry, I was going to say, though I didn't believe  it at the time, but I _have_ heard it said that you are _rather fond of  milk_, and don't mind sucking the farmers' cows sometimes.    TOUCHMENOT.    So you have heard that ridiculous story, have you? Well, you say you  don't believe it, so I sha'n't take the trouble to prove what a  monstrous fib it is. Now then, I'"]]]
