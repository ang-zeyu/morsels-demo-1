So off they went, Eve and Petro and their young, looking so much like  others of the swallow flock that we could not tell who they were, now  that they had stopped coming to their nest with one open and one closed  doorway.    They would have far to travel, even if they took the direct over-water  route, which many sorts of birds do. But what is distance to Petro,  whose strong wings carry him lightly? A mile or a hundred or a thousand  even are nothing if the hunting be good. Might just as well be flying  south, as back and forth over the same meadow the livelong day, with now  and then a rest on the roadside wires, which fit his little feet nearly  as well as the reeds of the marsh. Some people think it is for the sake  of the hunting that the route of the swallows lies overland, for they  fly by day and catch their game all along the way.    And as they journeyed, Eve and Petro and their flock, south and south  and south, maybe the children, here and there, waved their hands to them  and called, \"Good hunting, little friends of the air, and _good luck_  through all the winter till you come back to us again.\"    [Illustration: _A Famous Landmark._]          VI    UNCLE SAM      Uncle Sam stood at the threshold of his home, with an air of dignity.  There was enough to fill his breast with honest pride. His home had been  a famous landmark for generations before he himself had fallen heir to  it. It was the oldest one in the neighborhood. It had stood there  seventy-five years before, when a white man had built a cabin within  sight of it, for company. That cabin had been neglected and had fallen  to bits years ago; but Uncle Sam's ancestors had taken care of their  place, and had mended the weak spots each season, and had kept it in  such repair that it was still as good as ever. It would last, indeed,  with such treatment, as long as the post and the beams that supported it  held. The post was the trunk of a tall old tree, and the beams were the  branches, so near the top that it would be a very brave or a very  foolish man who would try to climb so far; for there were no stairs.    No stairs, and such a distance up! But Uncle Sam could find the path  that led to it; for was he not a lord of the air, and could he not sail  the roughest wind with those strong wings of his?    [Illustration: _Above all other creatures of this great land he had been  honored._]    Perhaps it was the sure strength of his wings that gave him a stately  poise of pride even as he rested. It could not have been the honor men  had bestowed upon him; for, although that was very great, he knew  nothing about it.    Soldiers had gone into battle for freedom and right, bearing the picture  of Uncle Sam on their banners. Veterans had walked in Memorial Day  parades, while over their gray heads floated the symbol of Uncle Sam and  the Stars and Stripes. Yes, the people of a great and noble land,  reaching from a sea on the east to a sea on the west, had honored Uncle  Sam by choosing him for the emblem of their country. His picture was  stamped on their paper money, and ornamented one side of the coins that  came from the mint, with the words, \"In God We Trust,\" on the other  side. Above all other creatures of this great land he had been honored;  and could he have understood, he might well have been justly proud of  this tribute.    But as it was, perhaps his emotions were centred only on his family; for  his home was shared by his mate and two young sons. He bent his white  head to look down at his twins. They were such hungry rascals and needed  such a deal of care! They had needed care, indeed, ever since the day  their little bodies had begun to form in the two bluish white eggs their  mother had laid in the nest. They had stayed inside those shells for a  month; and they never could have lived and grown there if they had not  been brooded and kept warm. Their mother had snuggled her feathers over  them and kept them cosy; and, when she had needed a change and a rest,  Uncle Sam had cuddled them close under his body; for a month is a long  time to keep eggs from getting cold, and it was only fair that he should  take his turn.    He was no shirk in his family life. He had chosen his mate until death  should part them; and whenever there were eggs in the nest, he was as  patient about brooding them as she was; for did they not belong to both  of them, and did they not contain two fine young eagles in the making?    And never had they had finer children than the two who that moment were  opening hungry mouths and begging for food. In answer to their teasing,  Uncle Sam spread his great wings and took stately flight to the lake.  For he was a fisherman. When a fish came to the surface, he would try to  catch it in his strong claws, so that he might have food to take back to  his waiting family. This was easy for him when the fish was wounded or  weak and had come to the surface to die; but the quick fishes often  escaped, because he was not so skillful at this sort of fishing as the  osprey.    Yes, the osprey was a wonderful fisherman, who could snatch a fish from  the water in his sure claws. But for all that, he was not so wonderful  as Uncle Sam, who could catch a fish in the air.    [Illustration: _The Yankee-Doodle Twins._]    Now, fishing in the air was a thrilling game that Uncle Sam loved. All  the wild delight of a chase was in the sport. He used, sometimes, to sit  high up on a cliff and watch the osprey swoop down to the water. Then,  when the hawk mounted with the prize, Uncle Sam flew far above him and  swept downward, commanding him to drop the fish. The smaller bird  obeyed, and let the fish fall from his claws. But it never fell far.  Uncle Sam closed his mighty wings and dropped with such speed that he  caught the fish in mid-air; and the tree-tops swayed with the sudden  wind his passing caused. Surely there was never a more exciting way of  going fishing than this!    And did the fish belong to the osprey or to Uncle Sam?    What would you call a man who, by power of greater strength, took away  the food another man had earned?    Are we, then, to call Uncle Sam a thief and a bully?    Ah, no; because it is not with an eagle as it is with a man.    For the wild things of the world there is only one law, and that is the  Law of Nature. They must live as they are made to live, and that is all  that concerns them. There is nothing for bird or beast or blossom to  learn about \"right\" or \"wrong,\" as we learn about those things. All they  need to do--any of them--is to live naturally.    When we think about it that way, it is very easy to tell whether the  fish belonged to the osprey or to Uncle Sam. Of course, to begin with,  the fish belonged to itself as long as it could dive quickly enough or  swim fast enough to keep itself free and safe. But the minute the osprey  caught it, it belonged to the osprey, just as much as it would belong to  you if you caught it with a net or a hook. Yes, the fish belonged to the  osprey _more_ than it would belong to you; for ospreys hunted food for  themselves and for their young in that lake centuries and centuries  before a white man even saw it, and before nets and hooks were invented;  and besides, in most places, the children of men can live and grow if  they never eat a fish, while the children of the osprey would die  without such food. So we admire Fisherman Osprey for his strength and  swiftness and skill, and are glad for him when he flies off with the  prize, which is his very own as long as he can keep it.    But when he drops it, it is his no longer, but the eagle's, who fishes  wonderfully in the air--a game depending on the keenness of his sight,  his strength, his quickness, and his skill; and the fish that belonged  first to itself, and then to the osprey, belonged in the end to the  eagle; and all this is according to the Law of Nature.    Uncle Sam was not selfish about that fish. He gave it to his twins, and  they did enjoy their dinner very, very much, indeed. A fresh brook  trout, browned just right, never tasted better to you. For they had been  hungry, and the food was good for them.    Uncle Sam and his mate, whom the children who lived within sight of  their nest named Aunt Samantha, had many a hunting and fishing trip to  take while the twins were growing; for the bigger the young eagles  became, the bigger their appetites were, too. But at last the  youngsters were old enough and strong enough and brave enough to take  their first flight. Think of them, then, standing there on the outer  porch of their great home in the air, and daring to leave it, when it  was so very high and they would have so very far to fall if their wings  did not work right!    Nonsense, an eagle fall! Had they not been stretching and exercising  their muscles for days? And surely the twins would succeed, with Uncle  Sam and Aunt Samantha to encourage and urge them forth.    The day Uncle Sam cheered his young sons in their baby flight was a  great day for all the country round. For not only were the sons of  eagles flying, but the sons of men were flying, too. Yes, it was  practice day near the lake, and across the water airships rose from the  camp and sailed through the air, like mighty birds meant for mighty  deeds. For Uncle Sam's country was at war, and many brave and noble lads  thrilled with pride because they were going to help win a battle for  Right.    The bravest and noblest and most fearless of all the camp caught sight  of Uncle Sam and smiled. \"Emblem of my country!\" the young man said.  \"King of the air in your strong flight! Great deeds are to be done, O  Eagle with the snow-white head, and your banner will be foremost in the  fight.\"    Uncle Sam made no reply. He was too far away to hear, and he could not  have understood "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#11)"],[1,"and me. This  lady came to me on the strength of our former acquaintance; she had so  little sense as not to perceive the immense distance between us which  a few days had caused, and that the opera-dancer kept by the prince de  Soubise could have no relation with the favorite of the king of France.  I endeavored, in vain, to make her perceive it, without mortifying her  too much. She always called me her dear friend, and fairly slaughtered  me with saying that _her_ prince would protect me. It was singular  for her to speak thus to me; to me from whom _her_ prince solicited  protection. She did not confine herself to this, she even insinuated to  me that I should be a gainer in some way. I laughed outright at this,  and said to the _valet de chambre_, who was stationed at the door, \"Call  mademoiselle's servants.\" This annoyed her excessively; all the muscles  of her face were contracted with rage; but she restrained her wrath,  saluted me with an assumed respect, and went away, after having so  worthily acquitted herself of her foolish embassy.    She had quitted me for an hour, when I received a letter from him who  had sent her. The prince de Soubise begged me to grant him an interview,  in which he could enter into an explanation. I replied that I would  receive him, and he came the same day.    \"I am much pained, madame,\" said he, on entering, \"that mademoiselle  Guimard has communicated with so little address what I wished to say to  you.\"    \"Prince, I think you would have done better to have been the bearer of  your own message. You know my station here, and would not have ridiculed  me as she has done.\"    M. de Soubise, much puzzled to know what she had said, asked me the  question.    \"Why,\" I replied, \"she said, that if I would follow your counsels, you  would pay me for my condescension.\"    \"Ah! madame,\" he exclaimed, \"she has completely murdered me. I only  charged her to offer my services to you, and throw myself at your feet,  as I do now.\"    \"Rise, prince, I do not accuse you of such folly, and promise not to  mention it: it is necessary, however, that you should know I have but  one part to play here, that of pleasing the king. Any other character  will not suit me. Honor me with your friendship, and accept mine in  return. I cannot, must not, have any other union with you.\"    Thus terminated this interview; it did not suit me to give the prince  de Soubise any hopes. He and all the Rohans would have lived on it; they  would have turned my confidence to their gain, and as they were for the  most part sharpers, or something akin to it, my name would soon have  been mixed up with some dirty transaction. His family was a hydra of  avarice, and would alone have swallowed up all the wealth of France. If  the king had taken one of the Rohan family for his mistress, I believe  that the finance department would not have sufficed for one year's  expenditure of this prodigal family. I had no objection to the prince de  Soubise coming to supper with me, but I did not feel myself disposed to  give him any control over my mind. I should have been ill-guided by a  man who had no government of himself.    If M, de Soubise did not depart satisfied, madame de Marsan, his  relative, to whom he related the bad success of his attempt, was not  more so. She was a woman to have governed a kingdom, had she been  allowed to do so. There was in her woman's head a capacity superior to  that of all the men of her family. She had a great deal of ambition, and  all her actions were the results of a premeditated plan. She would have  ruled the king, the princes, the princesses, favorites, mistresses, the  court, the city, the parliaments, and the army! Nothing would have been  impossible to her; she was adequate to any thing. Circumstances did not  give her the opportunity of displaying her genius. With great talents  and keen perception, she was reduced to the government of her own family  alone; that was but a trifling matter! In spite of her discontent,  madame de Marsan preserved a sort of neutrality towards me. She allowed  all sorts of ill to be spoken of me without ever repressing a word.  She was then mute and motionless. She saw me torn to pieces without  any emotion. However, when we were together she tried to cajole me in a  thousand ways, all the time detesting me in her heart; and I, who could  scarcely endure the sight of her, paid her a like number of little  attentions. Thus surrounded by hypocrites, I became one myself. We learn  to howl in the society of wolves.

M. the duc de la Vauguyon attempted also to  be the guide of my youth. This nobleman was too much of a Jesuit not to  have a nose of prodigiously fine scent. He perceived that the wind was  in my favor, and approached me in consequence. I have mentioned to  you his first visit, and he made me a second a few days afterwards.  He appeared very affable, very conciliating, and insisted particularly  several times, and that without any apparent motive, that the king,  not being now engaged in the ties of wedlock, he should choose some  agreeable companion, and assuredly could not do better than select  me. The day after this visit, early in the morning, the duke sent me a  splendid bouquet, a homage which he afterwards repeated, and then called  on me a third time.    During this visit after a conversation on the embarrassments of an  introduction at Versailles, he proposed that I should avoid them.    \"You cannot conceal from yourself,\" he said, \"how powerful will be the  cabal against you; and, without including the Choiseuls, you will have  especially to fear the pious party, who will only see in your intimacy  with the king, allow me to say, a crying scandal, and one not profitable  for religion.\"    \"If the pious party unite with those who are not so to destroy me,\" I  rejoined, laughing, \"I shall have all France against me.\"    \"No; but perhaps all the chateau. But there is a way of averting the  storm. Attach yourself to the party of honest men who have been so  greatly calumniated--the Jesuits. Philosophy, supported by the duc de  Choiseul, has repressed them; but the high clergy and the _mesdames  royales_ are attached strongly to them, and you would interest them in  your fortune by favoring these worthy fathers.\"    \"What! monsieur le duc,\" cried I, \"will _messeigneurs_ the clergy of  France, and _mesdames royales_ and their suite be favorable to me, if I  use my influence with the king in espousing the cause of the society of  Jesus?\"    \"Certainly, madame, and I am authorized to promise you. I give you my  word for this. Endeavor to re-establish the order, and there will not be  one of us but will be zealous in supporting you.\"    \"I certainly am desirous of pleasing your friends; but I can see that,  from the first moment of my appearance at court, I shall be at open war  with the Choiseuls and the parliaments.\"    \"What matters it? I confess that the victory will not be easy at first,  but there is no need to exaggerate the difficulties. It is true that the  king has esteem for the duc de Choiseul, but he has much affection for  you, which avails much more.    \"As for the parliaments, he hates them, and for many years has been  desirous of ridding himself of them entirely, and he will effect this by  the help of God and your interference.\"    \"This will be hard work for one so weak as I am.\"    \"Oh, you are sufficiently powerful, I assure you. Only confide in me,  the intermediary between you and my friends, let me guide you, and I  will steer to the right port. What do you think of this, madame?\"    \"Oh! monsieur le duc, it is not at a moment that we can give a positive  reply to such grave matters. I content myself in assuring you, that I  have for you as much confidence as respect, and should be very happy to  obtain your protection.\"    \"My protection! Oh, heaven, madame, you are jesting. It is I who should  be honored by your friendship.\"    \"It is yours; but as yet I am nothing at court, and can do nothing there  until I have been presented. It is for my speedy presentation that my  friends should labor now.\"    \"We will not fail, madame; and if you will allow me to come from time to  time to converse with you, we can take our measures.\"    \"Your visits will always be agreeable.\"    Such was the conversation which I had with the duc de la Vauguyon. I  have given it somewhat at length, because it was the preface to a deep  intrigue which made a vast noise. I think I extricated myself very  well from the net in which the duke sought to catch me. I knew that his  situation at Versailles compelled me to act with caution towards him. He  was in good odor with _mesdames_, had the ear of the young dauphin and  the princes his brothers. He deceived me like a true Jesuit as he was,  in telling me that the _mesdames_ were well disposed towards me; and on  my side I cheated him with a promise of confidence and, friendship which  I never bestowed. Ah! my friend, again and again must I exclaim, what a  villainous place is a court!    Whilst the duc de la Vauguyon was seeking to enlist me under the banners  of heaven or the Jesuits, the marquis of Chauvelin also essayed to make  me his pupil; but as frank as he was amiable, this nobleman did not go  to work in a roundabout manner. He came to me loyally, requesting me to  consider his interests and mine.    \"The king likes me,\" said he, \"and I am attached to him body and soul.  He tenderly loves you, and I should have no"]]]
