When we got back, half the birds would be  dead, and the other half all over the veldt.\"    \"Oh, bother those old ostriches! they're always in the way,\" cried Dyke.  \"All right, Joe; I'll stop and mind them, only don't be longer than you  can help.\"    \"I can't see how it can be done in less than ten days, old fellow,\" said  Emson thoughtfully; \"and if the old Boer is away, it may take a  fortnight.\"    \"All right; I won't mind,\" said Dyke with a sigh.  \"I'll take care of  the place, and I'm going to try some new plans.  There shan't be a  single bird die.  I say, oughtn't those young birds to be out by now?\"    \"I've been expecting them every day for a week,\" said Emson, rather  dolefully.  \"But, look here, little un: if you took Jack with you, do  you think you could manage the journey yourself?\"    Dyke turned on his horse and looked quite startled.    \"There's the driving.\"    \"Jack would drive,\" said Emson hastily.    \"And the inspanning and outspanning.\"    \"Which he could see to.\"    \"And camping out in the wagon alone.\"    \"Yes: you'd want good fires every night; but I can't help it, old  fellow.  Only one could go, and you'd be happier with the work and  excitement than you would be moping at the house, all alone, and  watching for me to come back.\"    \"But that would be just as bad for you, Joe; and you'd be thinking that  the lions had got me.\"    \"No, I shouldn't; but I should be trembling for the oxen, my boy.  There, I've made up my mind to send you, and you'll go.\"    \"Oh, I'll go,\" said Dyke sturdily; \"but why not go to Oom Schlagen? it's  twenty miles nearer.  He has a much better lot of things and is more  civil than Morgenstern.\"    \"Yes, I know all that, little un,\" said Emson; \"but Morgenstern is  honest.  He charges well for his corn and meal, but he'll give you just  measure, and will deal with you as fairly as he would with me.  Old  Uncle Schlagen would, as soon as he saw you--a boy--coming alone, set to  work to see if he couldn't rob you of a span of oxen, saying they were  his, and trick you over the stores in every way he could.\"    \"Then I'll go to old Morningstar's.\"    \"You won't mind going?\"    \"Oh yes, I shall, because it will be so lonely; but I'll go.\"    \"I don't like sending you, little un; and there's another difficulty.\"    \"Oh, never mind that; it's all difficulties out here.\"    \"True; but some are bigger than others.\"    \"Well, what's the big one now?\" said Dyke contemptuously, as if he had  grown so hardened that he could face anything.    \"Jack,\" said Emson laconically.    \"What!  Jack?  Yes, he'd better be,\" cried Dyke.  \"If he gives me any of  his nonsense, he'll have a rap over the head with the barrel of my gun.\"    \"How much of that is honest pluck, old chap, and how much bunkum?\" said  Emson, speaking very seriously.    \"I don't know,\" cried Dyke, colouring; \"I don't think there's any bounce  in it, Joe.  I meant it honestly.\"    \"But he is a man, and you are a boy.\"    \"Oh yes, he's a man, and he bullies and threatens Tanta Sal, and makes  believe that he is going to spear her, and directly she rushes at him,  he runs.  I don't think I should be afraid of Jack.\"    \"Neither do I, little un,\" cried Emson warmly.  \"That will do.  I was  nervous about this.  I felt that he might begin to show off as soon as  you two were away from me, and if he fancied that you were afraid of  him, he would be master to the end of the journey.\"    \"But if it came to a row, Joe, and I was horribly afraid of him, I  wouldn't let him see it.  Perhaps I should be, but--Oh no, I wouldn't  let him know.\"    \"That'll do, old fellow,\" said Emson, looking at his brother proudly.  \"You shall go, and I'll take care of the stock and--Here!  Look, look!\"    This last in a tone of intense excitement, for a herd of zebra seemed  suddenly to have risen out of the ground a couple of miles away, where  nothing had been visible before, the beautifully striped, pony-like  animals frisking and capering about, and pausing from time to time to  browse on the shoots of the sparsely spread bushes.  There were hundreds  of them, and the brothers sat watching them for some minutes.    \"Not what I should have chosen for food,\" said Emson at last; \"but they  say they are good eating.\"    \"There's something better,\" said Dyke, pointing.  \"I know they are  good.\"    \"Yes, we know they are good,\" said Emson softly, as he slipped out of  the saddle, Dyke following his example, and both sheltered themselves  behind their horses.    \"They haven't noticed us,\" said Emson, after a pause.  \"Mixed us up with  the zebras, perhaps.\"    \"They're coming nearer.  Why, there's quite a herd of them!\" cried Dyke  excitedly.    They stood watching a little group of springbok playing about beyond the  herd of zebra--light, graceful little creatures, that now came careering  down toward them, playfully leaping over each other's backs, and proving  again and again the appropriate nature of their name.    And now, as if quite a migration of animals was taking place across the  plain, where for months the brothers had wandered rarely seeing a head,  herd after herd appeared of beautiful deer-like creatures.  They came  into sight from the dim distance--graceful antelopes of different kinds,  with straight, curved, or lyre-shaped horns; fierce-looking gnus, with  theirs stumpy and hooked; ugly quaggas; and farthest off of all, but  easily seen from their size, great, well-fed elands, ox-like in girth.    \"I never saw anything like this, Joe,\" said Dyke in a whisper.    \"Few people ever have in these days, old fellow,\" said Emson, as he  feasted his eyes.  \"This must be like it used to be in the old times  before so much hunting took place.  It shows what an enormous tract of  unexplored land there must be off to the north-west.\"    \"And will they stay about here now?\"    \"What for?  To starve?  Why, Dyke, lad, there is nothing hardly to keep  one herd.  No; I daresay by this time to-morrow there will hardly be a  hoof.  They will all have gone off to the north or back to the west.  It  is quite a migration.\"    \"I suppose they take us for some kind of six-legged horse, or they would  not come so near.\"    \"At present.  Be ready; they may take flight at any moment, and we must  not let our fresh-meat supply get out of range.\"    \"'Tisn't in range yet,\" said Dyke quietly.    \"No, but it soon will be.\"    \"What are you going to shoot at?--the springbok, and then mount and  gallop after them and shoot again, like the Boers do?\"    \"What! with big antelope about?  No, boy; we want our larder filling up  too badly.  Look: impalas; and at those grand elands.\"    \"I see them; but they must be a mile away.\"    \"Quite; but they are coming in this direction.  Dyke, boy, we must make  up our mind to get one of these.\"    \"But we could never get it home.  They're bigger than bullocks.\"    \"Let's shoot one, and then talk of getting it home.  What about a span  of oxen and a couple of hurdles!  We could drag it back, and it would  make biltong, and so last us for weeks.\"    \"Ugh!  Leather!\" cried Dyke.    \"And give us plenty of fresh meat for present eating, and fat to cook  for months.\"    \"Don't make my mouth water too much, Joe.\"    \"Hush!  Be quiet now; move close up to your horse's shoulder, rest your  gun across it, and then you will be better hidden.  Are you loaded all  right?\"    \"Bullet in each barrel.\"    \"That will do.  Now mind, if we do get a chance at one, you will aim  just at the shoulder.  Try and don't be flurried.\"    \"All right.\"    \"Give him both barrels, so as to make sure.  Try and fire when I do.\"    Dyke nodded, and they waited for fully two hours, during which time  zebras, quaggas, and various kinds of antelopes charged down near them,  startled by the sight of the two curious-looking horses, standing so  patiently there in the middle of the plain, and after halting nervously,  they careered away again, the trampling of their feet sounding like the  rush of a storm.    Again and again the hunters had opportunities for bringing down goodly,  well-fed antelope, when a herd bounded up, wheeled, halted, and stood at  gaze; but there in the background were the great eland, each coming  slowly and cautiously on, as if they had also been surprised by the  aspect of the horses, and were curious to know what manner of creatures  these might be.    Dyke wanted to say \"Let's shoot;\" but his lips did not part, and he  stood patiently watching at one time, impatiently at another, feeling as  he did that his brother was letting a magnificent chance go by.    Twice over the position was startling, when first a herd of quaggas and  then one of gnus charged down upon them, and Dyke felt that the next  minute he would be trampled under foot by the many squadrons of  wild-eyed, shaggy little creatures.  But the horses stood fast,  comforted and encouraged by the presence of their masters, while the  fierce-looking herds halted, stood, stamped, and tossed their heads, and  went off again.    At last, when hundreds upon hundreds of the various antelopes had  passed, the elands were still browsing about, nearly half a mile away,  and seemed not likely to come any nearer.  A herd of smaller antelopes  were between them and the hunters, and there appeared to be no  likelihood of their firing a shot.    \"I'll give them a few minutes longer, Dyke,\" whispered Emson, \"and then  we must, if they don't come, go after them.\"    \"Wouldn't it be better to pick off a couple of these?\" said Dyke softly.    \"No; we must have one of those elands.  We shall have to ride one down,  and when we get close, leap off and fire.  Be ready for when I say  `Mount.'\"    Dyke nodded smartly, and waited impatiently for a full quarter of an  hour, during which they had chance after chance at small fry; but the  elands still held aloof.    All at once Emson's voice was heard in a low whisper: \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#11)"],[1,"do anything for the little  boy whom he loves.    But as it is a true story, I must tell you one more thing that  happened--and I am sure you will be delighted to hear about it. The  six Englishmen went to the palace, and laughed and laughed, and told  all about it to the little Prince whose birthday it was.    Then the Rajah, who was the little Prince's father, said that Baldo  and Chando should not be made to plow any more, or do another bit of  work in their lives. Why? Because Baldo and Chando had first helped to  save Gulab from the tiger at the pond, and then afterwards they had  helped to hunt the tiger.    So after that, Baldo and Chando were allowed to walk about the village  as they pleased, and nibble at anybody's hay or grass, and splash in  anybody's pond, and wallow in anybody's ditch, rut, or mire.    And what was little Gulab's reward for saving the six Englishmen?  Well, the little Prince, whose birthday it was, came and took Gulab by  the hand, and brought him to the grand palace, and gave him lots and  lots to eat--cakes and ice cream and candy--so that Gulab went home  that night very full and very happy.          CHAPTER IX    Deer and Antelope      The buffalo has many relatives among other animals which also have  _horns_. In fact, all animals that have horns are some relation to  each other--first cousin, second cousin, third cousin, and so on.    The buffalo's nearest relatives are the ordinary cows and bulls that  you see in the fields.    \"But the sheep and the goat also have horns,\" you may say. \"Are they  also cousins?\"    Yes, they are. In the same way the _deer_ and the _antelope_ are also  cousins to each other. I am now going to tell you about them.    The deer and the antelope are not exactly the same kind of animal, as  you might perhaps think. As I said, they are only cousins. If you look  at them carefully in the pictures on pages 103 and 109 you will see  which is the antelope and which is the deer--just as you can tell a  sheep from a goat.    [Illustration: Antelope  Photograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]    First see the picture on page 103. These are _antelope_. Look at the  horns carefully. They are something like a cow's horns; only, a  cow's horns are sometimes bent and twisted in different ways. But the  antelope's horns point upward, and are much longer than a cow's horns.  They sometimes look almost like a pair of long and thick spikes,  pointed at the top.    Now look at the picture on page 109. These are _deer_. Look at the  horns carefully--only, they are not called horns when the animal is a  deer, but _antlers_, which is a special name. So take a good look at  the deer's antlers. There are two of them, and they grow from the top  of his head, like the antelope's horns.    But look again. The antlers _start_ from the head as _two_ spikes, but  higher up each antler branches out into _many_ parts. In fact, near  the top each antler looks something like the branches of a small tree  without leaves.    So now you can always tell which is an antelope and which is a deer:  the antelope's horns have no branches, but the deer's antlers have  many branches.      _Horns and Antlers Different in Three Ways_    The antelope's horns and the deer's antlers are also different in  other ways, which you cannot see in the pictures. So I shall tell you  about them:    1. The antelope's horns are _hollow_ inside, and made of the same kind  of thing as the _hoofs_ or _nails_ of an animal, only they are thicker  and harder. But a deer's antlers are _solid_, and made of _bone_.    2. Both the Papas and the Mammas among antelopes have horns. But among  most kinds of deer, only the Papas have the antlers; the Mammas have  none.    3. Among antelopes, when once the Papas and the Mammas have grown  their horns, they keep them always. But among deer, the Papas throw  away their antlers every year, and grow _new ones_. That seems very  wonderful! I shall tell you more about it soon.    But now I shall tell you, little by little, all the wonderful things  the deer and the antelope can do. I shall begin with the deer, as  there are many kinds of deer in America.    Of course, in America there are not such wild jungles as in countries  which are hot all the year round. Still, there are many places in the  West and a few other parts of America where there is some kind of  jungle and plenty of forest. A forest is a kind of jungle, only it has  more trees, and fewer thickets; but wild animals can live there just  the same.      _Elk and Other American Deer_    The biggest kind of deer in America is the _moose_; in fact, it is the  biggest kind of deer in the world. The second biggest is the _elk_; he  is nearly as big as the moose. Some people think that the moose and  the elk are exactly the same kind of deer, but that is not quite  correct. In this book I must not make it too hard for you to  understand, by telling you how they are different. So I shall tell you  all about the elk, as his picture is on page 109.    Once upon a time elks lived in all parts of America, but now they have  been killed off by hunters in most parts, and are found wild only in  the Far West.    The elk is a fine fellow. At the shoulder he is as tall as a man, and  is as heavy as six men. He lives in places where there is plenty of  forest--that is, plenty of trees. Why trees? Because he needs them in  winter--for then the bark is his food!    In summer he has plenty to eat--leaves, twigs, and grass. But when the  winter comes, and the leaves fall, and the ground is covered with  snow, the poor elk would starve and die, if he did not have at least  the bark of trees to eat. And very little bark he gets for many days  at a time.    Here I must tell you that some kinds of deer are among the most _hardy  animals_; that means that at times they can live on very little. There  is a kind of deer, called the _reindeer_, that lives in the frozen  North, where there is snow and ice almost all the year round; and the  reindeer has nothing more to eat for many days than a little bit of  moss or seaweed.    But there is another animal, not a deer, that is still more hardy: he  can go a whole week without eating or drinking--and do work all the  time! That seems very wonderful. But I shall tell you about that  animal in another chapter.    Now about the elk. His antlers are fine! You can see in the picture  how huge they are. And yet, would you believe it, he grew them in only  five months! I told you a little while ago that a deer throws off his  antlers every year, and grows new ones. I shall now tell you how the  elk does that.    [Illustration: Elk  Photograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]    In the middle of the winter, the elk's antlers break off bit by bit.  In a few weeks they have all fallen off, leaving the elk's head  bare, with just a ridge or rough stump on it. Then, early in the  spring the new antlers start growing from the top of the stump. They  grow very fast, and in five months are as huge as ever.    But while the new antlers are growing, they are not hard. As yet they  are soft and tender, and all that time they have an outside covering  like hairy leather, to guard them from harm. But as soon as the elk  feels that his antlers are quite grown, and are strong and hard, he  strips off the outside covering by rubbing the antlers against trees.    Of course, while his antlers are still growing, and are soft and  tender, the elk cannot use them to fight another animal; so during  that time he hides in the bushes. But as soon as his new antlers have  become hard and strong, he is very brave again, and is ready to fight!    Does the elk fight much? He does! He fights most awfully when he has  his new antlers. What he fights about, and with whom he fights, I  shall tell you in another book.    There are a few other kinds of deer in America, but the funniest of  them is called the _mule deer_, which lives along the Rocky Mountains.  He is called the mule deer because he has very long ears, like a  mule's ears. And perhaps you have seen a mule bucking--that is,  jumping about while holding his legs quite stiff. Well, the mule deer  can buck just like that.    And while he is running at a gallop, he will often jump off the ground  with stiff legs, and then hop on and on many times like that, with  stiff legs, finishing up with another gallop.    That makes him look very funny, and because he jumps like that people  in Canada sometimes call him the _jumping deer_.      _Other Kinds of Deer_    I must now tell you about some other kinds of deer that live in  jungles and forests in other countries.    The _fallow deer_ lives in Europe. When he is wild, he lives in a  forest; but when he is tame, he lives in a park. He is a small deer,  about the size of a donkey. His coat is very soft and glossy and  beautiful. In winter his coat looks dark brown, and his legs and the  under part of his body are light brown. But in summer his coat becomes  a lovely light red in color, with white spots jotted all over it. Then  he is very handsome.    In India also there is a handsome deer, which the people call the  _lion deer_. He looks quite gentle and mild. Then why do the people  call him the lion deer? Because he has a lovely coat, golden yellow in  color. You could see him far across the open field, if he only stood  there. But he is so timid that he does not often come out in the open.    And why has he a yellow coat? Because he lives in a place where there  is plenty of yellow grass; and if he stood right in the middle of the  grass, and did not move, nobody could see him. Even if a tiger were  looking for him, and the deer stood quite still in the grass, the  tiger could not find him.    In another chapter I shall tell you how other animals have on their  bodies the _color of the place where they live, or where they want to  hide_.      _Barking Deer--O"]]]
