It was a special provision for a known and  particular territory, and to meet a present emergency, and nothing  more.    A brief summary of the history of the times, as well as the careful  and measured terms in which the article is framed, will show the  correctness of this proposition.    It will be remembered that, from the commencement of the Revolutionary  war, serious difficulties existed between the States, in relation to  the disposition of large and unsettled territories which were included  in the chartered limits of some of the States. And some of the other  States, and more especially Maryland, which had no unsettled lands,  insisted that as the unoccupied lands, if wrested from Great Britain,  would owe their reservation to the common purse and the common sword,  the money arising from them ought to be applied in just proportion  among the several States to pay the expenses of the war, and ought not  to be appropriated to the use of the State in whose chartered limits  they might happen to lie, to the exclusion of the other States, by  whose combined efforts and common expense the territory was defended  and preserved against the claim of the British Government.    These difficulties caused much uneasiness during the war, while the  issue was in some degree doubtful, and the future boundaries of the  United States yet to be defined by treaty, if we achieved our  independence.    The majority of the Congress of the Confederation obviously concurred  in opinion with the State of Maryland, and desired to obtain from the  States which claimed it a cession of this territory, in order that  Congress might raise money on this security to carry on the war. This  appears by the resolution passed on the 6th of September, 1780,  strongly urging the States to cede these lands to the United States,  both for the sake of peace and union among themselves, and to maintain  the public credit; and this was followed by the resolution of October  10th, 1780, by which Congress pledged itself, that if the lands were  ceded, as recommended by the resolution above mentioned, they should  be disposed of for the common benefit of the United States, and be  settled and formed into distinct republican States, which should  become members of the Federal Union, and have the same rights of  sovereignty, and freedom, and independence, as other States.    But these difficulties became much more serious after peace took  place, and the boundaries of the United States were established. Every  State, at that time, felt severely the pressure of its war debt; but  in Virginia, and some other States, there were large territories of  unsettled lands, the sale of which would enable them to discharge  their obligations without much inconvenience; while other States,  which had no such resource, saw before them many years of heavy and  burdensome taxation; and the latter insisted, for the reasons before  stated, that these unsettled lands should be treated as the common  property of the States, and the proceeds applied to their common  benefit.    The letters from the statesmen of that day will show how much this  controversy occupied their thoughts, and the dangers that were  apprehended from it. It was the disturbing element of the time, and  fears were entertained that it might dissolve the Confederation by  which the States were then united.    These fears and dangers were, however, at once removed, when the State  of Virginia, in 1784, voluntarily ceded to the United States the  immense tract of country lying northwest of the river Ohio, and which  was within the acknowledged limits of the State. The only object of  the State, in making this cession, was to put an end to the  threatening and exciting controversy, and to enable the Congress of  that time to dispose of the lands, and appropriate the proceeds as a  common fund for the common benefit of the States. It was not ceded,  because it was inconvenient to the State to hold and govern it, nor  from any expectation that it could be better or more conveniently  governed by the United States.    The example of Virginia was soon afterwards followed by other States,  and, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, all of the  States, similarly situated, had ceded their unappropriated lands,  except North Carolina and Georgia. The main object for which these  cessions were desired and made, was on account of their money value,  and to put an end to a dangerous controversy, as to who was justly  entitled to the proceeds when the lands should be sold. It is  necessary to bring this part of the history of these cessions thus  distinctly into view, because it will enable us the better to  comprehend the phraseology of the article in the Constitution, so  often referred to in the argument.    Undoubtedly the powers of sovereignty and the eminent domain were  ceded with the land. This was essential, in order to make it  effectual, and to accomplish its objects. But it must be remembered  that, at that time, there was no Government of the United States in  existence with enumerated and limited powers; what was then called the  United States, were thirteen separate, sovereign, independent States,  which had entered into a league or confederation for their mutual  protection and advantage, and the Congress of the United States was  composed of the representatives of these separate sovereignties,  meeting together, as equals, to discuss and decide on certain measures  which the States, by the Articles of Confederation, had agreed to  submit to their decision. But this Confederation had none of the  attributes of sovereignty in legislative, executive, or judicial  power. It was little more than a congress of ambassadors, authorized  to represent separate nations, in matters in which they had a common  concern.    It was this Congress that accepted the cession from Virginia. They had  no power to accept it under the Articles of Confederation. But they  had an undoubted right, as independent sovereignties, to accept any  cession of territory for their common benefit, which all of them  assented to; and it is equally clear, that as their common property,  and having no superior to control them, they had the right to exercise  absolute dominion over it, subject only to the restrictions which  Virginia had imposed in her act of cession. There was, as we have  said, no Government of the United States then in existence with  special enumerated and limited powers. The territory belonged to  sovereignties, who, subject to the limitations above mentioned, had a  right to establish any form of government they pleased, by compact or  treaty among themselves, and to regulate rights of person and rights  of property in the territory, as they might deem proper. It was by a  Congress, representing the authority of these several and separate  sovereignties, and acting under their authority and command, (but not  from any authority derived from the Articles of Confederation,) that  the instrument usually called the ordinance of 1787 was adopted;  regulating in much detail the principles and the laws by which this  territory should be governed; and among other provisions, slavery is  prohibited in it. We do not question the power of the States, by  agreement among themselves, to pass this ordinance, nor its obligatory  force in the territory, while the confederation or league of the  States in their separate sovereign character continued to exist.    This was the state of things when the Constitution of the United  States was formed. The territory ceded by Virginia belonged to the  several confederated States as common property, and they had united in  establishing in it a system of government and jurisprudence, in order  to prepare it for admission as States, according to the terms of the  cession. They were about to dissolve this federative Union, and to  surrender a portion of their independent sovereignty to a new  Government, which, for certain purposes, would make the people of the  several States one people, and which was to be supreme and controlling  within its sphere of action throughout the United States; but this  Government was to be carefully limited in its powers, and to exercise  no authority beyond those expressly granted by the Constitution, or  necessarily to be implied from the language of the instrument, and the  objects it was intended to accomplish; and as this league of States  would, upon the adoption of the new Government, cease to have any  power over the territory, and the ordinance they had agreed upon be  incapable of execution, and a mere nullity, it was obvious that some  provision was necessary to give the new Government sufficient power to  enable it to carry into effect the objects for which it was ceded, and  the compacts and agreements which the States had made with each other  in the exercise of their powers of sovereignty. It was necessary that  the lands should be sold to pay the war debt; that a Government and  system of jurisprudence should be maintained in it, to protect the  citizens of the United States who should migrate to the territory, in  their rights of person and of property. It was also necessary that the  new Government, about to be adopted, should be authorized to maintain  the claim of the United States to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#11)"],[1,"[30]  material Mind, or it is God in matter,--which are theo-    [Page 56.]    ries of agnosticism and pantheism, the very antipodes [1]  of Christian Science    _What is organic life?_    Life is inorganic, infinite Spirit; if Life, or Spirit,  were organic, disorganization would destroy Spirit and [5]  annihilate man.    If Mind is not substance, form, and tangibility, God  is substanceless; for the substance of Spirit is divine  Mind. Life is God, the only creator, and Life is im-  mortal Mind, not matter. [10]    Every indication of matter's constituting life is mortal,  the direct opposite of immortal Life, and infringes the  rights of Spirit. Then, to conclude that Spirit consti-  tutes or ever has constituted laws to that effect, is a mor-  tal error, a human conception opposed to the divine [15]  government. Mind and matter mingling in perpetual  warfare is a kingdom divided against itself, that shall be  brought to desolation. The final destruction of this  false belief in matter will appear at the full revelation  of Spirit,--one God, and the brotherhood of man. [20]  Organic life is an error of statement that Truth destroys.  The Science of Life needs only to be understood; its dem-  onstration proves the correctness of my statements, and  brings blessings infinite.    _Why did God command, __\"__Be fruitful, and multiply,_ [25]  _and replenish the earth,__\"__ if all minds (men) have existed_  _from the beginning, and have had successive stages of_  _existence to the present time?_    Your question implies that Spirit, which first spirit-  ually created the universe, including man, created man [30]    [Page 57.]    over again materially; and, by the aid of mankind, all [1]  was later made which _He had made_. If the first record  is true, what evidence have you--apart from the evi-  dence of that which you admit cannot discern spiritual  things--of any other creation? The creative \"Us\" [5]  made all, and Mind was the creator. Man originated  not from dust, materially, but from Spirit, spiritually.  This work had been done; the true creation was finished,  and its spiritual Science is alluded to in the first chapter  of Genesis. [10]    Jesus said of error, \"That thou doest, do quickly.\"  By the law of opposites, after the truth of man had been  demonstrated, the postulate of error must appear. That  this addendum was untrue, is seen when Truth, God,  denounced it, and said: \"I will greatly multiply thy [15]  sorrow.\" \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt  surely die.\" The opposite error said, \"I am true,\" and  declared, \"God doth know ... that your eyes shall be  opened, and ye shall be as gods,\" creators. This was false;  and the Lord God never said it. This history of a falsity [20]  must be told in the name of Truth, or it would have no  seeming. The Science of creation is the universe with man  created spiritually. The false sense and error of creation  is the sense of man and the universe created materially.    _Why does the record make man a creation of the sixth_ [25]  _and last day, if he was coexistent with God?_    In its genesis, the Science of creation is stated in mathe-  matical order, beginning with the lowest form and ascend-  ing the scale of being up to man. But all that really is,  always was and forever is; for it existed in and of the Mind [30]  that is God, wherein man is foremost.    [Page 58.]    _If one has died of consumption, and he has no remem-_ [1]  _brance of that disease or dream, does that disease have any_  _more power over him?_    Waking from a dream, one learns its _unreality_; then  it has no power over one. Waking from the dream of [5]  death, proves to him who thought he died that it was a  dream, and that he did not die; then he learns that con-  sumption did not kill him. When the belief in the power  of disease is destroyed, disease cannot return.    _How does Mrs. Eddy know that she has read and studied_ [10]  _correctly, if one must deny the evidences of the senses?_  _She had to use her eyes to read._    Jesus said, \"Having eyes, see ye not?\" I read the in-  spired page through a higher than mortal sense. As  matter, the eye cannot see; and as mortal mind, it is a [15]  belief that sees. I may read the Scriptures through a  belief of eyesight; but I must spiritually understand  them to interpret their Science.    _Does the theology of Christian Science aid its heal-_  _ing?_ [20]    Without its theology there is no mental science, no  order that proceeds from God. All Science is divine,  not human, in origin and demonstration. If God does  not govern the action of man, it is inharmonious: if He  does govern it, the action is Science. Take away the [25]  theology of mental healing and you take away its science,  leaving it a human \"mind-cure,\" nothing more nor less,  --even one human mind governing another; by which,  if you agree that God is Mind, you admit that there is    [Page 59.]    more than one government and God. Having no true [1]  sense of the healing theology of Mind, you can neither  understand nor demonstrate its Science, and will prac-  tise your belief of it in the name of Truth. This is the  mortal \"mind-cure\" that produces the effect of mes- [5]  merism. It is using the power of human will, instead  of the divine power understood, as in Christian Science;  and without this Science there had better be no \"mind-  cure,\"--in which the last state of patients is worse than  the first. [10]    _Is it wrong to pray for the recovery of the sick?_    Not if we pray Scripturally, with the understanding  that God _has_ given all things to those who love Him;  but pleading with infinite Love to love us, or to restore  health and harmony, and then to admit that it has been [15]  lost under His government, is the prayer of doubt and  mortal belief that is unavailing in divine Science.    _Is not all argument mind over mind?_    The Scriptures refer to God as saying, \"Come now, and  let us reason together.\" There is but one right Mind, and [20]  that one should and does govern man. Any copartnership  with that Mind is impossible; and the only benefit in  speaking often one to another, arises from the success that  one individual has with another in leading his thoughts  away from the human mind or body, and guiding them [25]  with Truth. That individual is the best healer who as-  serts himself the least, and thus becomes a transparency  for the divine Mind, who is the only physician; the divine  Mind is the scientific healer.    [Page 60.]    _How can you believe there is no sin, and that God does_ [1]  _not recognize any, when He sent His Son to save from_  _sin, and the Bible is addressed to sinners? How can you_  _believe there is no sickness, when Jesus came healing the_  _sick? [5]_    To regard sin, disease, and death with less deference,  and only as the woeful unrealities of being, is the only  way to destroy them; Christian Science is proving this by  healing cases of disease and sin after all other means have  failed. The Nazarene Prophet could make the unreality [10]  of both apparent in a moment.    _Does it not limit the power of Mind to deny the possi-_  _bility of communion with departed friends--dead only in_  _belief?_    Does it limit the power of Mind to say that addition [15]  is not subtraction in mathematics? The Science of Mind  reveals the impossibility of two individual sleepers, in  different phases of thought, communicating, even if touch-  ing each other corporeally; or for one who sleeps to  communicate with another who is awake. Mind's possi- [20]  bilities are not lessened by being confined and conformed  to the Science of being.    _If mortal mind and body are myths, what is the con-_  _nection between them and real identity, and why are there_  _as many identities as mortal bodies?_ [25]    Evil in the beginning claimed the power, wisdom, and  utility of good; and every creation or idea of Spirit has  its counterfeit in some matter belief. Every material be-  lief hints the existence of spiritual reality; and if mortals  are instructed in spiritual things, it will be seen that ma- [30]    [Page 61.]    terial belief, in all its manifestations, reversed, will be [1]  found the type and representative of verities priceless,  eternal, and just at hand.    The education of the future will be instruction, in spir-  itual Science, against the material symbolic counterfeit [5]  sciences. All the knowledge and vain strivings of mortal  mind, that lead to death,--even when aping the wisdom  and magnitude of immortal Mind,--will be swallowed  up by the reality and omnipotence of Truth over error,  and of Life over death. [10]    \"_Dear Mrs. Eddy_:--In the October _Journal_ I read  the following: \"But the real man, who was created in the  image of God, does not commit sin.\" _What then does sin?_  _What commits theft? Or who does murder?_ For instance,  the man is held responsible for the crime; for I went once [15]  to a place where a man was said to be \"hanged for mur-  der\"--and certainly I saw him, or his effigy, dangling  at the end of a rope. This \"man\" was held responsible  for the 'sin.' \"    _What sins?_ [20]    According to the Word, man is the image and likeness  of God. Does God's essential likeness sin, or dangle at  the end of a rope? If not, what does? A culprit, a sinner,  --anything but a man! Then, what is a sinner? A  mortal; but man is _immortal_. [25]    Again: mortals are the embodiments (or bodies, if  you please) of error, not of Truth; of sickness, sin, and  death. Naming these His embodiment, can neither make  them so nor overthrow the logic that man is God's like-  ness. Mortals seem very material; man in the likeness [30]    [Page 62.]    of Spirit is spiritual. Holding the _right_ idea of man in my [1]  mind, I can improve my own, and other people's individ-  uality, health, and morals; whereas, the opposite image  of man, a sinner, kept constantly in mind, can no more  improve health or"]]]
