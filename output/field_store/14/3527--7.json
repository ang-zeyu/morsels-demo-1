And really when one hath the Spleen,  every thing is to be excus'd by a Friend.      AIR XLVII. Now _Roger_, I'll tell thee because thou 'rt my Son.    [Music]        When a Wife's in her Pout,      (As she's sometimes, no doubt;)    The good Husband as meek as a Lamb,      Her Vapours to still,      First grants her her Will,    And the quieting Draught is a Dram. Poor Man!    And the quieting Draught is a Dram.    --I wish all our Quarrels might have so comfortable a Reconciliation.    _Polly._ I have no Excuse for my own Behaviour, Madam, but my  Misfortunes. --And really, Madam, I suffer too upon your Account.    _Lucy._ But, Miss _Polly_-- in the way of Friendship, will you give me  leave to propose a Glass of Cordial to you?    _Polly._ Strong-Waters are apt to give me the Head-ache-- I hope, Madam,  you will excuse me.    _Lucy._ Not the greatest Lady in the Land could have better in her  Closet, for her own private drinking. --You seem mighty low in Spirits,  my Dear.    _Polly._ I am sorry, Madam, my Health will not allow me to accept of  your Offer. --I should not have left you in the rude manner I did when  we met last, Madam, had not my Papa haul'd me away so unexpectedly--  I was indeed somewhat provok'd, and perhaps might use some Expressions  that were disrespectful. --But really, Madam, the Captain treated me  with so much Contempt and Cruelty, that I deserv'd your Pity, rather  than your Resentment.    _Lucy._ But since his Escape, no doubt all Matters are made up again.  --Ah _Polly_! _Polly_! 'tis I am the unhappy Wife; and he loves you as  if you were only his Mistress.    _Polly._ Sure, Madam, you cannot think me so happy as to be the object  of your Jealousy. --A Man is always afraid of a Woman who loves him too  well-- so that I must expect to be neglected and avoided.    _Lucy._ Then our Cases, my dear _Polly_, are exactly alike. Both of us  indeed have been too fond.      AIR XLVIII. O _Bessy Bell_.    [Music]      _Polly._ A Curse attend that Woman's Love,      Who always would be pleasing.      _Lucy._ The Pertness of the billing Dove,      Like Tickling, is but teazing.      _Polly._ What then in Love can Woman do:        _Lucy._ If we grow fond they shun us.      _Polly._ And when we fly them, they pursue:        _Lucy._ But leave us when they've won us.    _Lucy._ Love is so very whimsical in both Sexes, that it is impossible  to be lasting. --But my Heart is particular, and contradicts my own  Observation.    _Polly._ But really, Mistress _Lucy_, by his last Behaviour, I think I  ought to envy you. --When I was forc'd from him, he did not shew the  least Tenderness. --But perhaps, he hath a Heart not capable of it.      AIR XLIX. Would Fate to me _Belinda_ give.    [Music]      Among the Men, Coquettes we find,    Who court by turns all Woman-kind;    And we grant all their Hearts desir'd,    When they are flatter'd, and admir'd.    The Coquettes of both Sexes are Self-lovers, and that is a Love no other  whatever can dispossess. I hear, my dear _Lucy_, our Husband is one of  those.    _Lucy._ Away with these melancholy Reflections,-- indeed, my dear  _Polly_, we are both of us a Cup too low-- Let me prevail upon you to  accept of my Offer.      AIR L. Come, sweet Lass.    [Music]        Come, sweet Lass,      Let's banish Sorrow      'Till To-morrow;      Come, sweet Lass,    Let's take a chirping Glass.      Wine can clear      The Vapours of Despair      And make us light as Air;      Then drink, and banish Care.    I can't bear, Child, to see you in such low Spirits. --And I must  persuade you to what I know will do you good. [Aside.] I shall now soon  be even with the hypocrytical Strumpet.    [Exit.    _Polly._ All this Wheedling of _Lucy_ cannot be for nothing. --At this  time too! when I know she hates me! --The Dissembling of a Woman is  always the Forerunner of Mischief. --By pouring Strong-Waters down my  Throat, she thinks to pump some Secrets out of me,-- I'll be upon my  Guard, and won't taste a Drop of her Liquor, I'm resolv'd.      Re-enter _Lucy_, with Strong-Waters.    _Lucy._ Come, Miss _Polly_.    _Polly._ Indeed, Child, you have given yourself trouble to no purpose.  --You must, my Dear, excuse me.    _Lucy._ Really, Miss _Polly_, you are as squeamishly affected about  taking a Cup of Strong-Waters as a Lady before Company. I vow, _Polly_,  I shall take it monstrously ill if you refuse me. --Brandy and Men  (though Women love them ever so well) are always taken by us with some  Reluctance-- unless 'tis in private.    _Polly._ I protest, Madam, it goes against me. --What do I see!  _Macheath_ again in Custody! --Now every Glimm'ring of Happiness is  lost.        [Drops the Glass of Liquor on the Ground.    _Lucy._ Since things are thus, I'm glad the Wench hath escap'd: for by  this Event, 'tis plain, she was not happy enough to deserve to be  poison'd.      Enter _Lockit_, _Macheath_, _Peachum_.    _Lockit._ Set your Heart to rest, Captain. --You have neither the Chance  of Love or Money for another Escape,-- for you are order'd to be call'd  down upon your Trial immediately.    _Peachum._ Away, Hussies! --This is not a Time for a Man to be hamper'd  with his Wives. --You see, the Gentleman is in Chains already.    _Lucy._ O Husband, Husband, my Heart long'd to see thee; but to see thee  thus distracts me?    _Polly._ Will not my dear Husband look upon his _Polly_? Why hadst thou  not flown to me for Protection? with me thou hadst been safe.      AIR LI. The last time I went o'er the Moor.    [Music]      _Polly._ Hither, dear Husband, turn your Eyes.        _Lucy._ Bestow one Glance to cheer me.      _Polly._ Think with that Look, thy _Polly_ dies.        _Lucy._ O shun me not-- but hear me.      _Polly._ 'Tis _Polly_ sues.      _Lucy._                     --'Tis _Lucy_ speaks.        _Polly._ Is thus true Love requited?      _Lucy._ My Heart is bursting.      _Polly._                  --Mine too breaks.        _Lucy._ Must I      _Polly._       --Must I be slighted?    _Macheath._ What would you have me say, Ladies? --You see this affair  will soon be at an end, without my disobliging either of you.    _Peachum._ But the settling this Point, Captain, might prevent a  Law-Suit between your two Widows.      AIR LII. _Tom Tinker's_ my true Love.    [Music]      _Macheath._ Which way shall I turn me-- How can I decide?    Wives, the Day of our Death, are as fond as a Bride.    One Wife is too much for most Husbands to hear,    But two at a time there's no mortal can bear.    This way, and that way, and which way I will,    What would comfort the one, t' other Wife would take ill.    _Polly._ But if his own Misfortunes have made him insensible to mine--  A Father sure will be more compassionate-- Dear, dear Sir, sink the  material Evidence, and bring him off at his Trial-- _Polly_ upon her  Knees begs it of you.      AIR LIII. I am a poor Shepherd undone.    [Music]      When my Heroe in Court appears,      And stands arraign'd for his Life;    Then think of poor _Polly's_ Tears;      For Ah! poor _Polly's_ his Wife.    Like the Sailor he holds up his hand,      Distrest on the dashing Wave.    To die a dry Death at Land,      Is as bad as a watery Grave.        And alas, poor _Polly_!        Alack, and well-a-day!        Before I was in Love,        Oh! every Month was _May_.    _Lucy._ If _Peachum's_ Heart is harden'd; sure you, Sir, will have more  Compassion on a Daughter. --I know the Evidence is in your Power. --How  then can you be a Tyrant to me?    [Kneeling.      AIR LIV. _Ianthe_ the lovely, &c.    [Music]      When he holds up his Hand arraign'd for his Life,    O think of your Daughter, and think I'm his Wife!    What are Canons, or Bombs, or clashing of Swords?    For Death is more certain by Witnesses Words.    Then nail up their Lips; that dread Thunder allay;    And each Month of my Life will hereafter be _May_.    _Lockit._ _Macheath's_ Time is come, _Lucy_. --We know our own Affairs,  therefore let us have no more Whimpering or Whining.      AIR LV. A Cobler there was, &c.    [Music]      Ourselves, like the Great, to secure a Retreat,    When Matters require it, must give up our Gang:      And good reason why,      Or, instead of the Fry,      Ev'n _Peachum_ and I.    Like poor petty Rascals, might hang, hang;    Like poor petty Rascals, might hang.    _Peachum._ Set your Heart at rest, _Polly_. --Your Husband is to die  to-day. --Therefore if you are not already provided, 'tis high time to  look about for another. There's Comfort for you, you Slut.    _Lockit._ We are ready, Sir, to conduct you to the _Old Baily_.      AIR LVI. Bonny _Dundee_.    [Music]      _Macheath._ The Charge is prepar'd; the Lawyers are met,    The Judges all rang'd (a terrible Show!)    I go, undismay'd. --For Death is a Debt,    A Debt on Demand. --So take what I owe.    Then farewell, my Love-- Dear Charmers, adieu.    Contented I die-- 'Tis the better for you.    Here ends all Disputes the rest of our Lives,    For this way at once I please all my Wives.    Now, Gentlemen, I am ready to attend you.        [Exeunt _Macheath_, _Lockit_, and _Peachum_.      Enter _Filch_.    _Polly._ Follow them, _Filch_, to the Court. And when the Trial is over,  bring me a particular Account of his Behaviour, and of every thing that  happen'd-- You'll find me here with Miss _Lucy_. [Exit _Filch_.] But why  is all this Musick?    _Lucy._ The Prisoners, whose Trials are put off 'till next Session, are  diverting themselves.    _Polly._ Sure there is nothing so charming as Music! I'm fond of it to  Distraction! --But alas! --now, all Mirth seems an Insult upon my  Affliction. --Let us retire, my dear _Lucy_, and indulge our Sorrows.  --The noisy Crew, you see, are coming upon us.

Let it be at this, that there  were more than you could count on your right hand!'    'And why did you refuse them?'  The tone was wheedling, and the elder  woman loved to hear it.  Wheedling is the courtship, by the young of the  old.    'Because, my dear, I didn't love them.'    'But tell me, Auntie, was there never any one that you did love?'    'Ah! my dear, that is a different matter.  That is the real tragedy of a  woman's life.'  In flooding reminiscent thought she forgot her  remonstrating; her voice became full of natural pathos:    'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with your heart  all aflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seems to have passed away, and  all the world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To know that a  word might open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!  To keep back  the glances that could enlighten; to modulate the tones that might  betray!  To see all you hoped for passing away . . . to another! . . . '    Stephen bent over and kissed her, then standing up said:    'I understand!  Isn't it wrong, Auntie, that there should be such  tragedies?  Should not that glance be given?  Why should that tone be  checked?  Why should one be mute when a single word might, would, avert  the tragedy?  Is it not possible, Auntie, that there is something wrong  in our social system when such things can happen; and can happen so  often?'    She looked remorseless as well as irresistible in the pride of her  youthful strength as with eyes that blazed, not flashing as in passion  but with a steady light that seemed to burn, she continued:    'Some day women must learn their own strength, as well as they have  learned their own weakness.  They are taught this latter from their  cradles up; but no one ever seems to teach them wherein their power lies.  They have to learn this for themselves; and the process and the result of  the self-teaching are not good.  In the University Settlement I learned  much that made my heart ache; but out of it there seemed some lesson for  good.'  She paused; and her aunt, wishing to keep the subject towards  higher things, asked:    'And that lesson, Stephen dear?'  The blazing eyes turned to her so that  she was stirred by them as the answer came:    'It is bad women who seem to know men best, and to be able to influence  them most.  They can make men come and go at will.  They can turn and  twist and mould them as they choose.  And _they_ never hesitate to speak  their own wishes; to ask for what they want.  There are no tragedies, of  the negative kind, in _their_ lives.  Their tragedies have come and gone  already; and their power remains.  Why should good women leave power to  such as they?  Why should good women's lives be wrecked for a convention?  Why in the blind following of some society fetish should life lose its  charm, its possibilities?  Why should love eat its heart out, in vain?  The time will come when women will not be afraid to speak to men, as they  should speak, as free and equal.  Surely if a woman is to be the equal  and lifelong companion of a man, the closest to him--nay, the only one  really close to him: the mother of his children--she should be free at  the very outset to show her inclination to him just as he would to her.  Don't be frightened, Auntie dear; your eyes are paining me! . . . There!  perhaps I said too much.  But after all it is only theory.  Take for your  comfort, Auntie dear, that I am free an heart-whole.  You need not fear  for me; I can see what your dear eyes tell me.  Yes!  I am very young;  perhaps too young to think such things.  But I have thought of them.  Thought them all over in every way and phase I can imagine.'    She stopped suddenly; bending over, she took the old lady in her arms and  kissed her fondly several times, holding her tight.  Then, as suddenly  releasing her, she ran away before she could say a word.          CHAPTER VIII--THE T-CART      When Harold took his degree, Stephen's father took her to Cambridge.  She  enjoyed the trip very much; indeed, it seemed under conditions that were  absolutely happy.    When they had returned to Normanstand, the Squire took an early  opportunity of bringing Harold alone into his study.  He spoke to him  with what in a very young man would have seemed diffidence:    'I have been thinking, Harold, that the time has come when you should be  altogether your own master.  I am more than pleased, my boy, with the way  you have gone through college; it is, I am sure, just as your dear father  would have wished it, and as it would have pleased him best.'  He paused,  and Harold said in a low voice:    'I tried hard, sir, to do what I thought he would like; and what you  would.'  The Squire went on more cheerfully:    'I know that, my boy!  I know that well.  And I can tell you that it is  not the least of the pleasures we have all had in your success, how you  have justified yourself.  You have won many honours in the schools, and  you have kept the reputation as an athlete which your father was so proud  of.  Well, I suppose in the natural order of things you would go into a  profession; and of course if you so desire you can do that.  But if you  can see your way to it I would rather that you stayed here.  My house is  your home as long as I live; but I don't wish you to feel in any way  dependent.  I want you to stay here if you will; but to do it just  because you wish to.  To this end I have made over to you the estate at  Camp which was my father's gift to me when I came of age.  It is not a  very large one; but it will give you a nice position of your own, and a  comfortable income.  And with it goes my blessing, my dear boy.  Take it  as a gift from your father and myself!'    Harold was much moved, not only by the act itself but by the gracious way  of doing it.  There were tears in his eyes as he wrung the Squire's hand;  his voice thrilled with feeling as he said:    'Your many goodnesses to my father's son, sir, will, I hope, be justified  by his love and loyalty.  If I don't say much it is because I do not feel  quite master of myself.  I shall try to show in time, as I cannot say it  all at once, all that I feel.'    Harold continued to live at Normanstand.  The house at Camp was in  reality a charming cottage.  A couple of servants were installed, and now  and again he stayed there for a few days as he wished to get accustomed  to the place.  In a couple of months every one accepted the order of  things; and life at Normanstand went on much as it had done before Harold  had gone to college.  There was a man in the house now instead of a boy:  that was all.  Stephen too was beginning to be a young woman, but the  relative positions were the same as they had been.  Her growth did not  seem to make an ostensible difference to any one.  The one who might have  noticed it most, Mrs. Jarrold, had died during the last year of Harold's  life at college.    When the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates of the  county of Norcester, Squire Rowly arranged as usual to drive Squire  Norman.  This had been their habit for good many years.  The two men  usually liked to talk over the meeting as they returned home together.  It  was a beautiful morning for a drive, and when Rowly came flying up the  avenue in his T-cart with three magnificent bays, Stephen ran out on the  top of the steps to see him draw up.  Rowly was a fine whip, and his  horses felt it.  Squire Norman was ready, and, after a kiss from Stephen,  climbed into the high cart.  The men raised their hats and waved good-  bye.  A word from Rowly; with a bound the horses were off.  Stephen stood  looking at them delighted; all was so sunny, so bright, so happy.  The  world was so full of life and happiness to-day that it seemed as if it  would never end; that nothing except good could befall.    Harold, later on that morning, was to go into Norcester also; so Stephen  with a lonely day before her set herself to take up loose-ends of all  sorts of little personal matters.  They would all meet at dinner as Rowly  was to stop the night at Normanstand.    Harold left the club in good time to ride home to dinner.  As he passed  the County Hotel he stopped to ask if Squire Norman had left; and was  told that he had started only a short time before with Squire Rowly in  his T-cart.  He rode on fast, thinking that perhaps he might overtake  them and ride on with them.  But the bays knew their work, and did it.  They kept their start; it was only at the top of the North hill, five  miles out of Norcester, that he saw them in the distance, flying along  the level road.  He knew he would not now overtake them, and so rode on  somewhat more leisurely.    The Norcester highroad, when it has passed the village of Brackling,  turns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks.  From this the  road twists to the left again, making a double curve, and then runs to  Norling Parva in a clear stretch of some miles before reaching the sharp  turn down the hill which is marked 'Dangerous to Cyclists.'  From the  latter village branches the by-road over the hill which is the short cut  to Normanstand.    When Harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he saw a  belated road-mender, surrounded by some gaping peasants, pointing  excitedly in the distance.  The man, who of course knew him, called to  him to stop.    'What is it?' he asked, reining up.    'It be Squire Rowly's bays which have run away with him.  Three on 'em,  all in a row and comin' like the wind.  Squire he had his reins all  right, but they 'osses didn't seem to mind 'un.  They was fair mad and  bolted.  The leader he had got frightened at the heap o' stones theer,  an' the others took scare from him.'    Without a word Harold shook his reins and touched the horse with his  whip.  The animal seemed to understand and sprang forward, "]]]
