STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE              2 cups flour.            3/4 teaspoon salt.            4 teaspoons baking powder.            2 tablespoons Cottolene.            1 cup thin cream.    Process: Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Rub shortening in  with tips of fingers. Add cream, mix with a knife to a soft dough. Turn  on a floured board, knead slightly and divide the dough into two equal  parts. Pat and roll each piece to one-half inch thickness; lay one piece  in a buttered jelly cake pan, brush over with soft butter and place  remaining piece on top. Bake in a hot oven fifteen minutes. Remove from  oven; invert cake on a hot serving platter. Remove bottom layer (which  is now the top). Spread with soft butter and add a layer of berries  prepared as directed hereafter. Sift generously with bar sugar, replace  remaining cake, cover with berries, sprinkle with sugar, mask with  whipped cream sweetened and flavored with orange extract.    STRAWBERRY MIXTURE    Wash two quarts strawberries; hull and cut each berry in half. Prepare a  syrup by boiling together two cups sugar and one-half cup water four  minutes, cool and pour syrup over berries, or sprinkle raw sugar over  berries and let stand one hour. Lift the berries from syrup and place  between layer and on top of short cake. Strain syrup into a pitcher or  bowl and pass with each portion of short cake.

You  know the Governor is a very nice man, though he has the misfortune not  to be handsome.    \"I had just a splendid time at your place, and I envy your Aunt Eliza  her nephews and nieces. You were all so nice to me, and I didn't dare  to be a bit nice to you lest I should give myself away. But I'll make  up for that when you come to see me at Government House, as you all must  the very next time you come to town. I'm so sorry I didn't see Paddy,  for I love pussy cats, even if they do track molasses over my clothes.  And, Cecily, thank you ever so much for that little bag of pot-pourri.  It smells like a hundred rose gardens, and I have put it between the  sheets for my very sparest room bed, where you shall sleep when you come  to see me, you dear thing. And the Governor wants you to put his name on  the quilt square, too, in the ten-cent section.    \"Tell Dan I enjoyed his comments on the photographs very much. They were  quite a refreshing contrast to the usual explanations of 'who's who.'  And Felicity, your rusks were perfection. Do send me your recipe for  them, there's a darling.    \"Yours most cordially,                                    AGNES CLARK LESLEY.      \"Well, it was decent of her to apologize, anyhow,\" commented Dan.    \"If we only hadn't said that about the Governor,\" moaned Felicity.    \"How did you make your rusks?\" asked Aunt Janet. \"There was no  baking-powder in the house, and I never could get them right with soda  and cream of tartar.\"    \"There was plenty of baking-powder in the pantry,\" said Felicity.    \"No, there wasn't a particle. I used the last making those cookies  Thursday morning.\"    \"But I found another can nearly full, away back on the top shelf,  ma,--the one with the yellow label. I guess you forgot it was there.\"    Aunt Janet stared at her pretty daughter blankly. Then amazement gave  place to horror.    \"Felicity King!\" she exclaimed. \"You don't mean to tell me that you  raised those rusks with the stuff that was in that old yellow can?\"    \"Yes, I did,\" faltered Felicity, beginning to look scared. \"Why, ma,  what was the matter with it?\"    \"Matter! That stuff was TOOTH-POWDER, that's what it was. Your Cousin  Myra broke the bottle her tooth-powder was in when she was here last  winter and I gave her that old can to keep it in. She forgot to take it  when she went away and I put it on that top shelf. I declare you must  all have been bewitched yesterday.\"    Poor, poor Felicity! If she had not always been so horribly vain over  her cooking and so scornfully contemptuous of other people's aspirations  and mistakes along that line, I could have found it in my heart to pity  her.    The Story Girl would have been more than human if she had not betrayed a  little triumphant amusement, but Peter stood up for his lady manfully.    \"The rusks were splendid, anyhow, so what difference does it make what  they were raised with?\"    Dan, however, began to taunt Felicity with her tooth-powder rusks, and  kept it up for the rest of his natural life.    \"Don't forget to send the Governor's wife the recipe for them,\" he said.    Felicity, with eyes tearful and cheeks crimson from mortification,  rushed from the room, but never, never did the Governor's wife get the  recipe for those rusks.          CHAPTER VII. WE VISIT COUSIN MATTIE'S      One Saturday in March we walked over to Baywater, for a long-talked-of  visit to Cousin Mattie Dilke. By the road, Baywater was six miles away,  but there was a short cut across hills and fields and woods which was  scantly three. We did not look forward to our visit with any particular  delight, for there was nobody at Cousin Mattie's except grown-ups who  had been grown up so long that it was rather hard for them to remember  they had ever been children. But, as Felicity told us, it was necessary  to visit Cousin Mattie at least once a year, or else she would be  \"huffed,\" so we concluded we might as well go and have it over.    \"Anyhow, we'll get a splendiferous dinner,\" said Dan. \"Cousin Mattie's a  great cook and there's nothing stingy about her.\"    \"You are always thinking of your stomach,\" said Felicity pleasantly.    \"Well, you know I couldn't get along very well without it, darling,\"  responded Dan who, since New Year's, had adopted a new method of dealing  with Felicity--whether by way of keeping his resolution or because he  had discovered that it annoyed Felicity far more than angry retorts,  deponent sayeth not. He invariably met her criticisms with a  good-natured grin and a flippant remark with some tender epithet tagged  on to it. Poor Felicity used to get hopelessly furious over it.    Uncle Alec was dubious about our going that day. He looked abroad on  the general dourness of gray earth and gray air and gray sky, and said  a storm was brewing. But Cousin Mattie had been sent word that we  were coming, and she did not like to be disappointed, so he let us go,  warning us to stay with Cousin Mattie all night if the storm came on  while we were there.    We enjoyed our walk--even Felix enjoyed it, although he had been  appointed to write up the visit for Our Magazine and was rather weighed  down by the responsibility of it. What mattered it though the world were  gray and wintry? We walked the golden road and carried spring time in  our hearts, and we beguiled our way with laughter and jest, and the  tales the Story Girl told us--myths and legends of elder time.    The walking was good, for there had lately been a thaw and everything  was frozen. We went over fields, crossed by spidery trails of gray  fences, where the withered grasses stuck forlornly up through the  snow; we lingered for a time in a group of hill pines, great, majestic  tree-creatures, friends of evening stars; and finally struck into the  belt of fir and maple which intervened between Carlisle and Baywater.  It was in this locality that Peg Bowen lived, and our way lay near her  house though not directly in sight of it. We hoped we would not meet  her, for since the affair of the bewitchment of Paddy we did not know  quite what to think of Peg; the boldest of us held his breath as we  passed her haunts, and drew it again with a sigh of relief when they  were safely left behind.    The woods were full of the brooding stillness that often precedes a  storm, and the wind crept along their white, cone-sprinkled floors with  a low, wailing cry. Around us were solitudes of snow, arcades picked out  in pearl and silver, long avenues of untrodden marble whence sprang the  cathedral columns of the firs. We were all sorry when we were through  the woods and found ourselves looking down into the snug, commonplace,  farmstead-dotted settlement of Baywater.    \"There's Cousin Mattie's house--that big white one at the turn of the  road,\" said the Story Girl. \"I hope she has that dinner ready, Dan. I'm  hungry as a wolf after our walk.\"    \"I wish Cousin Mattie's husband was still alive,\" said Dan. \"He was an  awful nice old man. He always had his pockets full of nuts and apples.  I used to like going there better when he was alive. Too many old women  don't suit me.\"    \"Oh, Dan, Cousin Mattie and her sisters-in-law are just as nice and kind  as they can be,\" reproached Cecily.    \"Oh, they're kind enough, but they never seem to see that a fellow gets  over being five years old if he only lives long enough,\" retorted Dan.    \"I know a story about Cousin Mattie's husband,\" said the Story Girl.  \"His name was Ebenezer, you know--\"    \"Is it any wonder he was thin and stunted looking?\" said Dan.    \"Ebenezer is just as nice a name as Daniel,\" said Felicity.    \"Do you REALLY think so, my angel?\" inquired Dan, in honey-sweet tones.    \"Go on. Remember your second resolution,\" I whispered to the Story Girl,  who was stalking along with an outraged expression.    The Story Girl swallowed something and went on.    \"Cousin Ebenezer had a horror of borrowing. He thought it was simply  a dreadful disgrace to borrow ANYTHING. Well, you know he and Cousin  Mattie used to live in Carlisle, where the Rays now live. This was when  Grandfather King was alive. One day Cousin Ebenezer came up the hill and  into the kitchen where all the family were. Uncle Roger said he looked  as if he had been stealing sheep. He sat for a whole hour in the kitchen  and hardly spoke a word, but just looked miserable. At last he got up  and said in a desperate sort of way, 'Uncle Abraham, can I speak with  you in private for a minute?' 'Oh, certainly,' said grandfather, and  took him into the parlour. Cousin Ebenezer shut the door, looked  all around him and then said imploringly, 'MORE PRIVATE STILL.' So  grandfather took him into the spare room and shut that door. He was  getting frightened. He thought something terrible must have happened  Cousin Ebenezer. Cousin Ebenezer came right up to grandfather, took  hold of the lapel of his coat, and said in a whisper, 'Uncle Abraham,  CAN--YOU--LEND--ME--AN--AXE?'\"    \"He needn't have made such a mystery about it,\" said Cecily, who had  missed the point entirely, and couldn't see why the rest of us were  laughing. But Cecily was such a darling that we did not mind her lack of  a sense of humour.    \"It's kind of mean to tell stories like that about people who are dead,\"  said Felicity.    \"Sometimes it's safer than when they're alive though, sweetheart,\"  commented Dan.    We had our expected good dinner at Cousin Mattie's--may it be counted  unto her for righteousness. She and her sisters-in-law, Miss Louisa  Jane and Miss Caroline, were very kind to us. We had quite a nice time,  although I understood why Dan objected to them when they patted us  all on the head and told us whom we resembled and gave us peppermint  lozenges.          CHAPTER VIII.
