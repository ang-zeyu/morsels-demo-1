I used to think it enjoyed the  sport, and I believe it did. With the aid of my shaggy friend I have  successfully stalked hundreds of grouse, as its presence seemed to allay  both fear and suspicion. Firing over its back, its neck, or beneath its  belly--all were taken alike, patiently and sedately. An occasional  handful of oats, or half a loaf, cemented the friendship of the old  horse--my best and most constant poaching companion for years.          [Illustration]    Chapter 9.    RABBIT POACHING.      If well trained lurchers are absolutely necessary to hare poaching,  ferrets are just as important to successful rabbit poaching. Nearly  nothing in fur can be done without them. However lucky the moucher may  be among pheasants, partridge, or grouse, rabbits are and must be the  chief product of his nights. Of the methods of obtaining them--field  netting, well-traps, shooting--all are as nothing compared with silent  ferreting.    In the north we have two well-defined varieties of ferret--one a brown  colour and known as the polecat-ferret; the other, the common white  variety. The first is the hardier, and it is to secure this quality that  poachers cross their ferrets with the wild polecat. Unlike lurchers,  ferrets require but little training, and seem to work instinctively.  There are various reasons why poachers prefer white ferrets to the  polecat variety. At night a brown ferret is apt to be nipped up in  mistake for a rabbit; while a white one is always apparent, even when  moving among the densest herbage. Hence mouchers invariably use white  ones. Gamekeepers who know their business prefer ferrets taken from  poachers to any other. I was always particularly careful in selecting my  stock, as from the nature of my trade I could ill afford to use bad  ones. Certain strains of ferrets cause rabbits to bolt rapidly, while  others are slow and sluggish. It need hardly be said that I always used  the former. Even the best, however, will sometimes drive a rabbit to the  end of a \"blind\" burrow; and after killing it will not return until it  has gorged itself with blood. And more trouble is added if the ferret  curls itself up for an after-dinner sleep. Then it has either to be left  or dug out. The latter process is long, the burrows ramify far into the  mound, and it is not just known in which the ferret remains. If it be  left it is well to bar every hole with stones, and then return with a  dead rabbit when hunger succeeds the gorged sleep. It is to guard  against such occasions as these that working ferrets are generally  muzzled. A cruel practise used to obtain among poachers of stitching  together the lips of ferrets to prevent their worrying rabbits and then  \"laying up.\" For myself I made a muzzle of soft string which was  effective, and at the same time comfortable to wear. When there was a  chance of being surprised at night work I occasionally worked ferrets  with a line attached; but this is an objectionable practice and does not  always answer. There may be a root or stick in which the line gets  entangled, when there will be digging and no end of trouble to get the  ferret out. From these facts, and the great uncertainty of ferreting, it  will be understood why poachers can afford to use only the best  animals. A tangled hedgebank with coarse herbage was always a favourite  spot for my depredations. There are invariably two, often half a dozen  holes, to the same burrow. Small purse nets are spread over these, and I  always preferred these loose to being pegged or fixed in any way. When  all the nets are set the ferrets are turned in. They do not proceed  immediately, but sniff the mouth of the hole; their indecision is only  momentary, however, for soon the tip of the tail disappears in the  darkness. And now silence is essential to success, as rabbits refuse to  bolt if there is the slightest noise outside. A dull thud, a rush, and a  rabbit goes rolling over and over entangled in the purse. Reserve nets  are quickly clapped on the holes as the rabbits bolt, the latter  invariably being taken except where a couple come together. Standing on  the mound a shot would stop these as they go bounding through the dead  leaves, but the sound would bring up the keeper, and so one has to  practise self-denial. Unlike hares, rabbits rarely squeal when they  become entangled; and this allows one to ferret long and silently.  Rabbits bolt best on a windy day and before noon; after that they are  sluggish and often refuse to come out at all. This is day ferreting, but  of course mine was done mainly at night. In this case the dogs always  ranged the land, and drove everything off it before we commenced  operations. On good ground a mound or brae sometimes seemed to explode  with rabbits, so wildly did they fly before their deadly foe. I have  seen a score driven from one set of holes, while five or six couples is  not at all uncommon. When ferrets are running the burrows, stoats and  weasels are occasionally driven out; and among other strange things  unearthed I remember a brown owl, a stock-dove, and a shell-drake--each  of which happened to be breeding in the mounds.    [Illustration]    The confines of a large estate constitute a poacher's paradise, for  although partridge and grouse require land suited to their taste,  rabbits and pheasants are common to all preserved ground. And then the  former may be taken at any time, and in so many different ways. They  are abundant, too, and always find a ready market. The penalties  attached to rabbit poaching are less than those of game, and the conies  need not be followed into closely preserved coverts. The extermination  of the rabbit will be contemporaneous with that of the lurcher and  poacher--two institutions of village life which date back to the time of  the New Forest. Of the many mouching modes for taking conies,  ferretting, as already stated, and field netting are the most common.  Traps with steel jaws are sometimes set in runs, inserted in the turf so  as to bring them flush with the sward. But destruction by this method is  not sufficiently wholesale, and the upturned white under-parts of the  rabbit's fur show too plainly against the green. The poacher's methods  must be quick, and he cannot afford to visit by day traps set in the  dark. The night must cover all his doings. When the unscrupulous keeper  finds a snare he sometimes puts a leveret into it, and secretes himself.  Then he waits, and captures the poacher \"in the act.\" As with some  other methods already mentioned, the trap poacher is only a casual.  Ferretting is silent and almost invariably successful. In warrens, both  inequalities of the ground, mounds, and ditches afford good cover. My  best and most wholesale method of field-poaching for rabbits was by  means of two long nets. These are from a hundred to a hundred and fifty  yards in length, and about four feet high. They are usually made of  silk, and are light and strong, and easily portable. These are set  parallel to each other along the edge of a wood, about thirty yards out  into the pasture. Only about four inches divides the nets. A dark windy  night is best for the work, as in such weather rabbits feed far out in  the fields. On a night of this character, too, the game neither hears  nor sees the poacher. The nets are long--the first small in mesh, that  immediately behind large. When a rabbit or hare strikes, the impetus  takes a part of the first net and its contents through the larger mesh  of the second, and there, hanging, the creature struggles until it is  knocked on the head with a stick. Immediately the nets are set, two men  and a brace of lurchers range the ground in front, slowly and patiently,  and gradually drive every feeding thing woodwards. A third man quietly  paces the sward behind the nets, killing whatever strikes them. In this  way I have taken many scores of rabbits in a single night. On the  confines of a large estate a rather clever trick was once played upon  us. Each year about half-a-dozen black or white rabbits were turned down  into certain woods. Whilst feeding, these stood out conspicuously from  the rest, and were religiously preserved. Upon these the keepers kept a  close watch, and when any were missing it was suspected what was going  on, when the watching strength was increased. As soon as we detected the  trick, we were careful to let the coloured rabbits go free. We found  that it was altogether to our interest to preserve them.    During night poaching for rabbits and hares the ground game is driven  from its feeding ground to the woods or copses. Precisely the reverse  method is employed during the day when the game is in cover. The  practice is to find a spinny in which both rabbits and hares are known  to lie; and then to set purse nets on the outside of every opening which  may possibly be used by the frightened animals. The smaller the wood or  patch of cover the easier it is to work. A man, with or without a dog,  enters the covert, and his presence soon induces the furry denizens to  bolt. As these rush through their customary runs they find themselves in  the meshes of a net, and every struggle only makes them faster. This  method has the disadvantage of being done in the light, but where there  is much game is very deadly.    Snares for hares and rabbits are not used nearly so much now as  formerly. For all that, they are useful in outlying districts, or on  land that is not closely watched. For hares the snare is a wire noose  tied to a stick with string, and placed edgeways in the trod. To have  the snare the right height is an important matter; and it will be found  that two fists high for a hare, and one for a rabbit, is the most  deadly. Casuals set their snares in hedge-bottoms, but these are no  good.

Haldimand took up his residence at  Quebec, and therefrom, for a decade, administered the affairs of the  Canadian frontier with zeal and adroitness. He was a thorough soldier,  as his letters show. He was also an adept in the treatment of matters  which, like the retention by the British of the frontier posts for  thirteen years after they had been ceded to the Americans by treaty,  called for dogged determination, veiled behind diplomatic courtesies.  The troops which he commanded were scattered from the mouth of the St.  Lawrence to Lake Michigan; but to no part of this long line of  wilderness defense--a line which was substantially the enemy's  frontier--did he pay more constant attention than to Fort Niagara. There  were good reasons for this. Fort Niagara was not only the key to the  upper lakes, the base of supplies for Detroit, Michillimackinac and  minor posts, but it had long been an important trading post and the  principal rendezvous of the Six Nations, upon whose peculiarly efficient  services against the American frontiers Sir Frederick relied scarcely  less than he did upon the British troops themselves. It was, therefore,  with no ordinary solicitude that he made his appointments for Niagara.    I cannot state positively the names of all officers in command at Fort  Niagara from the time war was begun, down to 1777. Lieut. Lernault,  afterwards at Detroit, was here for a time; but about the spring of '77  we find Fort Niagara put under the command of Lieut. Col. Mason Bolton,  of the 34th Royal Artillery. He had then seen some years of service in  America; had campaigned in Florida and the West Indies; had been sent to  Mackinac and as far west as the Illinois; and it was no slight tribute  to his ability and fidelity, when Haldimand put the Niagara frontier  into his hands. Here, for over three years, he was the chief in command.  In military rank, even if in nothing else, he was the principal man in  this region during the crucial period of the Revolution. He commanded  the garrison at Fort Niagara, and its dependencies at Schlosser and Fort  Erie. Buffalo was then unthought of--it was merely Te-hos-e-ro-ron, the  place of the basswoods; but at the Indian villages farther up Buffalo  Creek, which came into existence in 1780, the name of Col. Bolton stood  for the highest military authority of the region. And yet, incredible as  it may seem, after all these years in which--to adapt Carlyle's  phrase--the Torch of History has been so assiduously brandished about, I  do not know of any printed book which offers any information about Col.  Mason Bolton or the life he led here. Indeed, with one or two  exceptions, in which he is barely alluded to, I think all printed  literature may be searched in vain for so much as a mention of his name.    Other chief men of this frontier, at the period we are considering, were  Col. Guy Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs; Sir John Johnson,  son of the Sir William who captured Fort Niagara from the French in  1759; Col. John Butler, of the Queen's Rangers; his son Walter;  Sayenqueraghta, the King of the Senecas; Rowland Montour, his half-breed  son-in-law; and Brant, the Mohawk hero, who, equipped with a New England  schooling and enlightened by a trip to England, here returned to lead  out scalping parties in the British interests.    Col. Bolton had been for some time without authentic news of the enemy,  when on the morning of December 14, 1777, the little garrison was thrown  into unwonted activity by the arrival of Capt. La Mothe, who reported  that Gen. Howe had taken Philadelphia, and that the rebels had  \"sustained an incredible loss.\" By a forced march of Howe, La Mothe  averred, Gen. Washington had been defeated, \"with 11,000 rebels killed,  wounded and prisoners.\" Two days later the excitement was increased by  the arrival at the fort of some Delaware Indians, who brought the great  news that Washington was killed and his army totally routed. \"I had a  meeting of the chiefs of the Six Nations,\" wrote Bolton to Gen.  Carleton, \"about an hour after the express arrived and told them the  news. They seemed extremely pleased and have been in good temper ever  since their arrival.\" Oddly enough, this news was confirmed by a soldier  of the 7th Regiment, who had been taken prisoner by the Americans, but  had escaped and made his way to Niagara. He further embellished the  report by declaring that 9,000 men under Lord Percy defeated 13,000  rebels at Bear's Hill on December 20th, under Washington, that Gates was  sent for to take the command when Washington was killed, and that 7,000  volunteers from Ireland had joined Howe's army. Washington at this time,  the reader will remember, had gone into winter quarters with his army at  Valley Forge.    There were 2,300 Indians at Fort Niagara at this period, all making  perpetual demands for beef, flour and rum. The license of the jubilee  over Washington's death probably was limited only by the scantiness of  provisions and the impossibility of adding to the store. Cold weather  shut down on the establishment, the vessels were laid up, and all winter  long Col. Bolton and his men had no word contradicting the report of  Washington's death. As late as April 8th, the following spring, he wrote  to Gen. Carleton that \"all accounts confirm Washington being killed and  his army defeated in December last, and that Gates was sent for to take  the command.\"    The British early were apprised of Sullivan's intended raid, and  although powerless to prevent it, kept well posted as to its progress.  The various parties which Sullivan encountered, were directed from Fort  Niagara. \"Since the rebels visit the Indian country,\" wrote Gen.  Haldimand to Sir John Johnson, September 14, 1779, \"I am happy they are  advancing so far. They can never reach Niagara and their difficulties  and danger of retreat will, in proportion as they advance, increase.\"  Again he wrote twelve days later: \"You will be able to make your way to  Niagara, and if the rebels should be encouraged to advance as far as  that place, I am convinced that few of them will escape from famine or  the sword. All in my power to do for you is to push up provisions, which  shall be done with the utmost vigor, while the river and lake remain  navigable, although it may throw me into great distress in this part of  the province, should anything happen to prevent the arrival of the fall  victuallers.\" There was however genuine alarm at Fort Niagara, and even  Sir Frederick himself, though he wrote so confidently to Bolton, in his  letters to the Ministry expressed grave apprehensions of what might  happen.    What did happen was bad enough for British interests, for though the  Americans turned back, the raid had driven in upon Bolton a horde of  frightened, hungry and irresponsible Indians, who had to be fed at the  King's expense and were a source of unmeasured concern to the overworked  commandant, notwithstanding the independent organization of the Indian  Department which was effected.    To arrive at a just idea of conditions hereabouts at this period, we  must keep in mind the relation of the fluctuating population, Indians  and whites, to the uncertain and often inadequate food supply.    Fort Niagara at this time--the fall of '78--was a fortification 1,100  yards in circumference, with five bastions and two blockhouses. Capt.  John Johnson thought 1,000 men were needed to defend it; \"the present  strength,\" he wrote, \"amounting to no more than 200 rank and file,  including fifteen men of the Royal Artillery and the sick, a number  barely sufficient to defend the outworks (if they were in a state of  defense) and return the necessary sentries, should the place be infested  by a considerable force.... With a garrison of 500 or a less number, it  is impregnable against all the savages in America, but if a strong body  of troops with artillery should move this way, I believe no engineer who  has ever seen these works will say it can hold out any considerable  time.\"    On May 1st, 1778, there had been in the garrison at Fort Niagara 311  men. Half a dozen more were stationed at Fort Schlosser, and thirty-two  at Fort Erie, a total of 349, of whom 255 were reported as fit for duty.  At this time Maj. Butler's Rangers, numbering 106, had gone on \"an  expedition with the Indians towards the settlements of Pennsylvania or  New York, whichever he finds most practicable and advantageous to the  King's service.\" These raids from Fort Niagara were far more frequent  than one would infer from the histories--even from the American  histories whose authors are not to be suspected of purposely minimizing  either their number or effect. But it appears from the records that not  infrequently the expeditions accomplished nothing of more consequence  than to steal stock. Horses, cattle and sheep were in more than one  instance driven away from settlements far down on the Mohawk or  Susquehanna, and brought back alive or dead along the old trails, to  Fort Niagara.    To illustrate the methods of the time: In a report to Brig. Gen. Powell,  Maj. Butler wrote: \"In the spring of 1778 I found it absolutely  requisite for the good of His Majesty's service, with the consent and  approbation of Lt. Col. Bolton, and on the application of the chiefs and  warriors of the five united nations ..., to proceed to the frontiers of  the colonies in rebellion, with as many officers and men of my corps as  were then raised, in order to protect the Indian settlements and to  annoy the enemy.\" At this time many of his men were new recruits from  the colonies, sons or heads of Loyalist--or as we used to say, on this  side the border, of Tory--families. As they approached American frontier  settlements, the loyalty to King George of some of his men became  suspicious, so that Butler issued a proclamation that all"]]]
