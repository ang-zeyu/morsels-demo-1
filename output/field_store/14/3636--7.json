The contents of the hernia may be  formed by a part of the bowel, by a portion of the peritoneum, or may  contain portions of both peritoneum and bowel. When the sac contains only  the peritoneum it has a doughy feel, but when it is formed by a portion of  the bowel it is more elastic on pressure.    _Causes._--In the new-born animal the opening of the navel is generally  large, and may sometimes give way to the pressure of the bowel on account  of the weak and relaxed condition of the abdominal muscles. This defective  and abnormal condition of the umbilicus is frequently hereditary. It may be  occasioned by roughly pulling away the umbilical cord; through kicks or  blows on the belly; through any severe straining by which the sides of the  navel are stretched apart. We may mention in this connection that it is  best in new-born calves to tie the umbilical cord tightly about 2 inches  from the navel, and then to leave it alone, when in most cases it will drop  off in a few days, leaving the navel closed.    _Treatment._--It is well to bear in mind that many, and especially the  smaller, umbilical hernias heal spontaneously; that is, nature effects a  cure. As the animal gets older the abdominal muscles get stronger and  possess more power of resistance to pressure, the bowels become larger and  do not pass so readily through a small opening, so that from a combination  of causes there is a gradual growing together or adhesion of the sides of  the navel. In cases of umbilical hernia in which there are no indications  that a spontaneous cure will take place, the calf should be laid on its  back; immediately on this being done the hernia will often disappear into  the abdomen. If it does not, its reduction may be brought about by gentle  handling, endeavoring, if need be, to empty the organs forming the hernia  before returning them into the abdomen. After the hernia has been returned,  the hair should be clipped from the skin covering it and a compress  composed of 10 or 12 folds of linen or cotton should be applied, first  smearing the skin with pitch and then a bandage about 3 inches wide should  be passed round the body so as to retain the compress in position. The  lower part of the compress should be smeared with pitch, and also those  portions of the bandage which pass over it, so as to keep it solid and  prevent it from shifting. In some cases it will be found that the contents  of the sac can not be returned into the abdomen, and this generally arises  from the fact that some part of the contents of the sac has grown to or  become adherent to the edges of the umbilical opening. In such a case the  skin must be carefully laid open in the long direction, the adhesions of  the protruding organs carefully separated from the umbilicus, and after the  protruding parts have been returned into the abdomen, the sides of the  umbilicus must be freshened if necessary by paring, and then the edges of  the opening brought together by catgut stitches; the wound in the skin must  then also be brought together by stitches. The wound must be carefully  dressed every day and a bandage passed round the body so as to cover and  protect the part operated on.    In small hernias nitric acid has been used successfully in the same manner  as has been described in the treatment of ventral hernia. Sulphuric acid  has also been used for a similar purpose, diluting it to the extent of 1  part of acid to 3 or 5 of water. In thin-skinned animals the weaker  preparations ought to be preferred, and caution must be exercised in using  such preparations so as not to destroy the tissues on which they are  applied.    Another method of treatment is, after the contents of the sac have been  returned into the abdomen, to tie a piece of strong waxed cord round the  pendulous portion which formed the outer covering of the hernia. The string  is apt to slacken after two or three days, when a new piece of cord should  be applied above the first one. The constriction of the skin sets up  inflammation, which generally extends to the umbilicus and causes the edges  to adhere together, and by the time the portion of skin below the ligature  has lost its vitality and dropped off, the umbilicus is closed and there is  no danger of the abdominal organs protruding through it. This is what takes  place when this method has a favorable result, though if the umbilicus does  not become adherent and the skin sloughs, the bowels will protrude through  the opening.    GUT-TIE (PERITONEAL HERNIA).--In peritoneal hernia of the ox a loop or  knuckle of intestine enters from the abdomen into a rent in that part of  the peritoneum which is situated at the margin of the hip bone or it passes  under the remains of the spermatic cord, the end of which may be grown fast  to the inner inguinal ring. The onward pressure of the bowel, as well as  the occasional turning of the latter round the spermatic cord, is the cause  of the cord exercising considerable pressure on the bowel, which occasions  irritation, obstructs the passage of excrement, and excites inflammation,  which terminates in gangrene and death.    The rent in the peritoneum is situated at the upper and front part of the  pelvis, nearer to the sacrum than the pubes.    _Causes._--Among the causes of peritoneal hernia considerable importance is  attached to a method of castration which is practiced in certain districts,  viz, the tearing or rupturing of the spermatic cord by main force instead  of dividing it at a proper distance above the testicle in a surgical  manner. After this violent and rough method of operating, the cord retracts  into the abdomen and its stump becomes adherent to some part of the  peritoneum, or it may wind around the bowel and then the stump becomes  adherent, so that strangulation of the bowel results. The rough dragging on  the cord may also cause a tear in the peritoneum, the result of which need  not be described. The severe exertion of ascending hills and mountains,  drawing heavy loads, or the straining which oxen undergo while fighting  each other may also give rise to peritoneal hernia.    _Symptoms._--The ox suddenly becomes very restless, stamps with his feet,  moves backward and forward, hurriedly lies down, rises, moves his tail  uneasily, and kicks at his belly with the foot of the affected side. The  pain evinced may diminish but soon returns again. In the early stage there  are frequent passages of dung, but after the lapse of 18 or 24 hours this  ceases, the bowel apparently being emptied to the point of strangulation,  and the passages now consist only of a little mucus mixed with blood. When  injections are given at this time the water passes out of the bowel without  even being colored. The animal lies down on the side where the hernia  exists and stretches out his hind feet in a backward direction. These two  particular symptoms serve to distinguish this affection from enteritis and  invagination of the bowel. As time passes the animal becomes quieter, but  this cessation of pain may indicate that gangrene of the bowel has set in,  and may, therefore, under certain circumstances, be considered a precursor  of death. Gangrene may take place in from four to six days, when  perforation of the bowel may occur and death result in a short time.    _Treatment._--In the first place the ox should be examined by passing the  oiled hand and arm into the rectum; the hand should be passed along the  margin of the pelvis, beginning at the sacrum and continuing downward  toward the inguinal ring, when a soft, painful swelling will be felt, which  may vary from the size of an apple to that of the two fists. This swelling  will be felt to be tightly compressed by the spermatic cord. It very rarely  happens that there is any similar swelling on the left side, though in such  cases it is best to make a thorough examination. The bowel has sometimes  been released from its position by driving the ox down a hill; by causing  him to jump from a height of 2 feet to the ground; the expedient of  trotting him also has been resorted to with the hope that the jolting  movement might bring about a release of the bowel. If the simple expedients  mentioned have been tried and failed, then the hand being passed into the  rectum should be pressed gently on the swelling in an upward and forward  direction, so as to endeavor to push the imprisoned portion of the bowel  back into the abdomen. While this is being done the ox's hind feet should  stand on higher ground than the front, so as to favor the slipping out of  the bowel by its own weight, and at the same time an assistant should  squeeze the animal's loins, so as to cause it to bend downward and so relax  the band formed by the spermatic cord. If the imprisoned portion of gut is  freed, which may be ascertained by the disappearance of the swelling, the  usual sounds produced by the bowels moving in the abdomen will be heard,  and in a few hours the feces and urine will be passed as usual. If the  means mentioned fail to release the imprisoned portion of the gut, then  an incision about 4 inches long must be made in the right flank in a  downward direction, the hand introduced into the abdomen, the situation  and condition of swelling exactly ascertained, and then a probe-pointed  knife inserted between the imprisoned bowel and band compressing it, and  turned outward against the band, the latter being then cautiously divided  and the imprisoned gut allowed to escape, or, if necessary, the bowel  should be drawn gently from its position into the abdomen. The wound in the  flank must be brought together in the same way as in the case of the wound  made in operating for impaction of the rumen.      WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN.    A wound of the abdomen may merely penetrate the skin; but as such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#11)"],[1,"will eventually  outnumber the parent States, and the colonists will outnumber the  citizens of the original States and will themselves become the nation.  Such has been the history of the United States and its people. By 1850,  indeed, one-half of the population of the United States was living  west of the Alleghany Mountains, and at the present time approximately  seventy per cent are to be found in the West.    The importance of the Ordinance of 1787 was hardly overstated by Webster  in his famous debate with Hayne when he said: \"We are accustomed to  praise the lawgivers of antiquity; we help to perpetuate the fame of  Solon and Lycurgus; but I doubt whether one single law of any lawgiver,  ancient or modern, has produced effects of more distinct, marked and  lasting character than the Ordinance of 1787.\" While improved means  of communication and many other material ties have served to hold the  States of the Union together, the political bond was supplied by the  Ordinance of 1787, which inaugurated the American colonial system.        CHAPTER V. DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN    John Fiske summed up the prevailing impression of the government of  the Confederation in the title to his volume, \"The Critical Period of  American History.\" \"The period of five years,\" says Fiske, \"following  the peace of 1783 was the most critical moment in all the history of the  American people. The dangers from which we were saved in 1788 were even  greater than were the dangers from which we were saved in 1865.\" Perhaps  the plight of the Confederation was not so desperate as he would have  us believe, but it was desperate enough. Two incidents occurring between  the signing of the preliminary terms of peace and the definitive  treaty reveal the danger in which the country stood. The main body  of continental troops made up of militiamen and short-term  volunteers--always prone to mutinous conduct--was collected at Newburg  on the Hudson, watching the British in New York. Word might come at any  day that the treaty had been signed, and the army did not wish to be  disbanded until certain matters had been settled primarily the question  of their pay. The officers had been promised half-pay for life, but  nothing definite had been done toward carrying out the promise. The  soldiers had no such hope to encourage them, and their pay was sadly in  arrears. In December, 1782, the officers at Newburg drew up an address  in behalf of themselves and their men and sent it to Congress. Therein  they made the threat, thinly veiled, of taking matters into their own  hands unless their grievances were redressed.    There is reason to suppose that back of this movement--or at least in  sympathy with it--were some of the strongest men in civil as in military  life, who, while not fomenting insurrection, were willing to bring  pressure to bear on Congress and the States. Congress was unable  or unwilling to act, and in March, 1783, a second paper, this time  anonymous, was circulated urging the men not to disband until the  question of pay had been settled and recommending a meeting of officers  on the following day. If Washington's influence was not counted upon,  it was at least hoped that he would not interfere; but as soon as he  learned of what had been done he issued general orders calling for  a meeting of officers on a later day, thus superseding the  irregular meeting that had been suggested. On the day appointed the  Commander-in-Chief appeared and spoke with so much warmth and feeling  that his \"little address... drew tears from many of the officers.\" He  inveighed against the unsigned paper and against the methods that were  talked of, for they would mean the disgrace of the army, and he appealed  to the patriotism of the officers, promising his best efforts in  their behalf. The effect was so strong that, when Washington withdrew,  resolutions were adopted unanimously expressing their loyalty and their  faith in the justice of Congress and denouncing the anonymous circular.    The general apprehension was not diminished by another incident in June.  Some eighty troops of the Pennsylvania line in camp at Lancaster marched  to Philadelphia and drew up before the State House, where Congress was  sitting. Their purpose was to demand better treatment and the payment of  what was owed to them. So far it was an orderly demonstration, although  not in keeping with military regulations; in fact the men had broken  away from camp under the lead of noncommissioned officers. But when  they had been stimulated by drink the disorder became serious. The  humiliating feature of the situation was that Congress could do nothing,  even in self-protection. They appealed, to the Pennsylvania authorities  and, when assistance was refused, the members of Congress in alarm fled  in the night and three days later gathered in the college building in  Princeton.    Congress became the butt of many jokes, but men could not hide the  chagrin they felt that their Government was so weak. The feeling  deepened into shame when the helplessness of Congress was displayed  before the world. Weeks and even months passed before a quorum could be  obtained to ratify the treaty recognizing the independence of the United  States and establishing peace. Even after the treaty was supposed to  be in force the States disregarded its provisions and Congress could do  nothing more than utter ineffective protests. But, most humiliating of  all, the British maintained their military posts within the northwestern  territory ceded to the United States, and Congress could only request  them to retire. The Americans' pride was hurt and their pockets were  touched as well, for an important issue at stake was the control of the  lucrative fur trade. So resentment grew into anger; but the British held  on, and the United States was powerless to make them withdraw. To make  matters worse, the Confederation, for want of power to levy taxes, was  facing bankruptcy, and Congress was unable to devise ways and means to  avert a crisis.    The Second Continental Congress had come into existence in 1775. It was  made up of delegations from the various colonies, appointed in more or  less irregular ways, and had no more authority than it might assume and  the various colonies were willing to concede; yet it was the central  body under which the Revolution had been inaugurated and carried through  to a successful conclusion. Had this Congress grappled firmly with the  financial problem and forced through a system of direct taxation, the  subsequent woes of the Confederation might have been mitigated  and perhaps averted. In their enthusiasm over the Declaration of  Independence the people--by whom is meant the articulate class  consisting largely of the governing and commercial elements--would  probably have accepted such a usurpation of authority. But with their  lack of experience it is not surprising that the delegates to Congress  did not appreciate the necessity of such radical action and so were  unwilling to take the responsibility for it. They counted upon the  goodwill and support of their constituents, which simmered down to a  reliance upon voluntary grants from the States in response to appeals  from Congress. These desultory grants proved to be so unsatisfactory  that, in 1781, even before the Articles of Confederation had been  ratified, Congress asked for a grant of additional power to levy a duty  of five per cent ad valorem upon all goods imported into the United  States, the revenue from which was to be applied to the discharge of  the principal and interest on debts \"contracted... for supporting  the present war.\" Twelve States agreed, but Rhode Island, after some  hesitation, finally rejected the measure in November, 1782.    The Articles of Confederation authorized a system of requisitions  apportioned among the \"several States in proportion to the value of all  land within each State.\" But, as there was no power vested in Congress  to force the States to comply, the situation was in no way improved when  the Articles were ratified and put into operation. In fact, matters grew  worse as Congress itself steadily lost ground in popular estimation,  until it had become little better than a laughing-stock, and with the  ending of the war its requests were more honored in the breach than in  the observance. In 1782 Congress asked for $8,000,000 and the following  year for $2,000,000 more, but by the end of 1783 less than $1,500,000  had been paid in.    In the same year, 1783, Congress made another attempt to remedy the  financial situation by proposing the so-called Revenue Amendment,  according to which a specific duty was to be laid upon certain articles  and a general duty of five per cent ad valorem upon all other goods,  to be in operation for twenty-five years. In addition to this it was  proposed that for the same period of time $1,500,000 annually should  be raised by requisitions, and the definite amount for each State was  specified until \"the rule of the Confederation\" could be carried into  practice: It was then proposed that the article providing for the  proportion of requisitions should be changed so as to be based not upon  land values but upon population, in estimating which slaves should be  counted at three-fifths of their number. In the course of three years  thereafter only two States accepted the proposals in full, seven agreed  to them in part, and four failed to act at all. Congress in despair then  made a further representation to the States upon the critical condition  of the finances and accompanied this with an urgent appeal, which  resulted in all the States except New York agreeing to the proposed  impost. But the refusal of one State was sufficient to block the  whole measure, and there was no further hope for a treasury that was  practically bankrupt. In five years Congress had received less than two  and one-half million dollars from"]]]
