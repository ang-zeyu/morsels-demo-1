Such things have happened in stories!\" Poor Zoe!  she was for a few seconds unfaithful to the memory of Antoine La Chance.  But Dame Bedard settled all surmises by turning to Master Pothier, who  stood stiff and upright as became a limb of the law. \"Here is  Master Pothier, your Honor, who knows every highway and byway in ten  seigniories. He will guide your Honor to Beaumanoir.\"    \"As easy as take a fee or enter a process, your Honor,\" remarked Master  Pothier, whose odd figure had several times drawn the criticizing eye of  Colonel Philibert.    \"A fee! ah! you belong to the law, then, my good friend? I have known  many advocates--\" but Philibert stopped; he was too good-natured to  finish his sentence.    \"You never saw one like me, your Honor was going to say? True, you never  did. I am Master Pothier dit Robin, the poor travelling notary, at your  Honor's service, ready to draw you a bond, frame an acte of convention  matrimoniale, or write your last will and testament, with any notary in  New France. I can, moreover, guide your Honor to Beaumanoir as easy as  drink your health in a cup of Cognac.\"    Philibert could not but smile at the travelling notary, and thinking to  himself, \"too much Cognac at the end of that nose of yours, my friend!\"  which, indeed, looked fiery as Bardolph's, with hardly a spot for a fly  to rest his foot upon without burning.    \"But how will you go, friend?\" asked Philibert, looking down at Master  Pothier's gamaches; \"you don't look like a fast walker.\"    \"Oh, your Honor,\" interrupted Dame Bedard, impatiently, for Zoe had  been twitching her hard to let her go. \"Master Pothier can ride the old  sorrel nag that stands in the stable eating his head off for want of  hire. Of course your Honor will pay livery?\"    \"Why, certainly, Madame, and glad to do so! So Master Pothier make  haste, get the sorrel nag, and let us be off.\"    \"I will be back in the snap of a pen, or in the time Dame Bedard can  draw that cup of Cognac, your Honor.\"    \"Master Pothier is quite a personage, I see,\" remarked Philibert, as the  old notary shuffled off to saddle the nag.    \"Oh, quite, your Honor. He is the sharpest notary, they say, that  travels the road. When he gets people into law they never can get  out. He is so clever, everybody says! Why, he assures me that even the  Intendant consults him sometimes as they sit eating and drinking half  the night together in the buttery at the Chateau!\"    \"Really! I must be careful what I say,\" replied Philibert, laughing, \"or  I shall get into hot water! But here he comes.\"    As he spoke, Master Pothier came up, mounted on a raw-boned nag, lank as  the remains of a twenty-years lawsuit. Zoe, at a hint from the Colonel,  handed him a cup of Cognac, which he quaffed without breathing, smacking  his lips emphatically after it. He called out to the landlady,--\"Take  care of my knapsack, dame! You had better burn the house than lose my  papers! Adieu, Zoe! study over the marriage contract till I return, and  I shall be sure of a good dinner from your pretty hands.\"    They set off at a round trot. Colonel Philibert, impatient to reach  Beaumanoir, spurred on for a while, hardly noticing the absurd figure  of his guide, whose legs stuck out like a pair of compasses beneath his  tattered gown, his shaking head threatening dislodgment to hat and wig,  while his elbows churned at every jolt, making play with the shuffling  gait of his spavined and wall-eyed nag.        CHAPTER VI. BEAUMANOIR.      They rode on in silence. A little beyond the village of Charlebourg  they suddenly turned into the forest of Beaumanoir, where a well-beaten  track, practicable both for carriages and horses, gave indications that  the resort of visitors to the Chateau was neither small nor seldom.    The sun's rays scarcely penetrated the sea of verdure overhead. The  ground was thickly strewn with leaves, the memorials of past summers;  and the dark green pines breathed out a resinous odor, fresh and  invigorating to the passing rider.    Colonel Philibert, while his thoughts were for the most part fixed on  the public dangers which led to this hasty visit of his to the Chateau  of Beaumanoir, had still an eye for the beauty of the forest, and not a  squirrel leaping, nor a bird fluttering among the branches, escaped his  notice as he passed by. Still he rode on rapidly, and having got fairly  into the road, soon outstripped his guide.    \"A crooked road this to Beaumanoir,\" remarked he at length, drawing  bridle to allow Master Pothier to rejoin him. \"It is as mazy as the law.  I am fortunate, I am sure, in having a sharp notary like you to conduct  me through it.\"    \"Conduct you! Your Honor is leading me! But the road to Beaumanoir is as  intricate as the best case ever drawn up by an itinerant notary.\"    \"You seldom ride, Master Pothier?\" said Philibert, observing his guide  jolting with an audible grunt at every step of his awkward nag.    \"Ride, your Honor! N--no! Dame Bedard shall call me plaisant Robin  if she ever tempts me again to mount her livery horse--'if fools only  carried cruppers!' as Panurge says.\"    \"Why, Master Pothier?\" Philibert began to be amused at his odd guide.    \"Why? Then I should be able to walk to-morrow--that is all! This nag  will finish me. Hunc! hanc! hoc! He is fit to be Satan's tutor at the  seminary! Hoc! hanc! hunc! I have not declined my pronouns since I left  my accidence at the High School of Tours--not till to-day. Hunc! hanc!  hoc! I shall be jolted to jelly! Hunc! hanc! hoc!\"    Philibert laughed at the classical reminiscences of his guide; but,  fearing that Pothier might fall off his horse, which he straddled like  a hay-fork, he stopped to allow the worthy notary to recover his breath  and temper.    \"I hope the world appreciates your learning and talent, and that it uses  you more gently than that horse of yours,\" remarked he.    \"Oh, your Honor! it is kind of you to rein up by the way. I find no  fault with the world if it find none with me. My philosophy is this,  that the world is as men make it.\"    \"As the old saying is,--          \"'To lend, or to spend, or to give in,         'Tis a very good world that we live in;        But to borrow, or beg, or get a man's own,         'Tis the very worst world that ever was known.'      And you consider yourself in the latter category, Master Pothier?\"  Philibert spoke doubtingly, for a more self-complacent face than his  companion's he never saw--every wrinkle trembled with mirth; eyes,  cheeks, chin, and brows surrounded that jolly red nose of his like a  group of gay boys round a bonfire.    \"Oh, I am content, your Honor! We notaries are privileged to wear furred  cloaks in the Palais de Justice, and black robes in the country when we  can get them! Look here at my robe of dignity!\" He held up the tattered  tail of his gown with a ludicrous air. \"The profession of notary is  meat, drink, and lodging: every man's house is free to me--his bed and  board I share, and there is neither wedding, christening, nor funeral,  in ten parishes that can go on without me. Governors and intendants  flourish and fall, but Jean Pothier dit Robin, the itinerant notary,  lives merrily: men may do without bread, but they will not live without  law--at least, in this noble, litigious New France of ours.\"    \"Your profession seems quite indispensable, then!\" remarked Philibert.    \"Indispensable! I should think so! Without proper actes the world would  soon come to an end, as did Adam's happiness in Eden, for want of a  notary.\"    \"A notary, Master Pothier?\"    \"Yes, your Honor. It is clear that Adam lost his first estate de usis et  fructibus in the Garden of Eden, simply because there was no notary to  draw up for him an indefeasable lease. Why, he had not even a bail a  chaptal (a chattel mortgage) over the beasts he had himself named!\"    \"Ah!\" replied Philibert, smiling, \"I thought Adam lost his estate  through a cunning notary who persuaded his wife to break the lease he  held; and poor Adam lost possession because he could not find a second  notary to defend his title.\"    \"Hum! that might be; but judgment went by default, as I have read.  It would be different now; there are notaries, in New France and Old,  capable of beating Lucifer himself in a process for either soul, body,  or estate! But, thank fortune, we are out of this thick forest now.\"    The travellers had reached the other verge of the forest of Beaumanoir.  A broad plain dotted with clumps of fair trees lay spread out in a royal  domain, overlooked by a steep, wooded mountain. A silvery brook crossed  by a rustic bridge ran through the park. In the centre was a huge  cluster of gardens and patriarchal trees, out of the midst of which rose  the steep roof, chimneys, and gilded vanes, flashing in the sun, of the  Chateau of Beaumanoir.    The Chateau was a long, heavy structure of stone, gabled and pointed  in the style of the preceding century--strong enough for defence, and  elegant enough for the abode of the Royal Intendant of New France. It  had been built, some four-score years previously, by the Intendant Jean  Talon, as a quiet retreat when tired with the importunities of friends  or the persecution of enemies, or disgusted with the cold indifference  of the Court to his statesmanlike plans for the colonization of New  France.    A short distance from the Chateau rose a tower of rough  masonry--crenellated on top, and loopholed on the sides--which had been  built as a place of defence and refuge during the Indian wars of the  preceding century. Often had the prowling bands of Iroquois turned away  baffled and dismayed at the sight of the little fortalice surmounted  by a culverin or two, which used to give the alarm of invasion to the  colonists on the slopes of Bourg Royal, and to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#11)"],[1,"on  him, her face flushed and her eyes shining, and the necklace Uya had  made about her neck. It was a splendid time, and the stars that look  down on us looked down on her, our ancestor--who has been dead now these  fifty thousand years.      II--THE CAVE BEAR    In the days when Eudena and Ugh-lomi fled from the people of Uya towards  the fir-clad mountains of the Weald, across the forests of sweet  chestnut and the grass-clad chalkland, and hid themselves at last in the  gorge of the river between the chalk cliffs, men were few and their  squatting-places far between. The nearest men to them were those of the  tribe, a full day's journey down the river, and up the mountains there  were none. Man was indeed a newcomer to this part of the world in that  ancient time, coming slowly along the rivers, generation after  generation, from one squatting-place to another, from the  south-westward. And the animals that held the land, the hippopotamus and  rhinoceros of the river valleys, the horses of the grass plains, the  deer and swine of the woods, the grey apes in the branches, the cattle  of the uplands, feared him but little--let alone the mammoths in the  mountains and the elephants that came through the land in the  summer-time out of the south. For why should they fear him, with but the  rough, chipped flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he threw  but ill, and the poor spear of sharpened wood, as all the weapons he had  against hoof and horn, tooth and claw?    Andoo, the huge cave bear, who lived in the cave up the gorge, had never  even seen a man in all his wise and respectable life, until midway  through one night, as he was prowling down the gorge along the cliff  edge, he saw the glare of Eudena's fire upon the ledge, and Eudena red  and shining, and Ugh-lomi, with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the  white cliff, going to and fro, shaking his mane of hair, and waving the  axe of stone--the first axe of stone--while he chanted of the killing  of Uya. The cave bear was far up the gorge, and he saw the thing  slanting-ways and far off. He was so surprised he stood quite still upon  the edge, sniffing the novel odour of burning bracken, and wondering  whether the dawn was coming up in the wrong place.    He was the lord of the rocks and caves, was the cave bear, as his  slighter brother, the grizzly, was lord of the thick woods below, and as  the dappled lion--the lion of those days was dappled--was lord of the  thorn-thickets, reed-beds, and open plains. He was the greatest of all  meat-eaters; he knew no fear, none preyed on him, and none gave him  battle; only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength. Even the mammoth  shunned his country. This invasion perplexed him. He noticed these new  beasts were shaped like monkeys, and sparsely hairy like young pigs.  \"Monkey and young pig,\" said the cave bear. \"It might not be so bad. But  that red thing that jumps, and the black thing jumping with it yonder!  Never in my life have I seen such things before!\"    He came slowly along the brow of the cliff towards them, stopping thrice  to sniff and peer, and the reek of the fire grew stronger. A couple of  hyaenas also were so intent upon the thing below that Andoo, coming soft  and easy, was close upon them before they knew of him or he of them.  They started guiltily and went lurching off. Coming round in a wheel, a  hundred yards off, they began yelling and calling him names to revenge  themselves for the start they had had. \"Ya-ha!\" they cried. \"Who can't  grub his own burrow? Who eats roots like a pig?... Ya-ha!\" for even in  those days the hyaena's manners were just as offensive as they are now.    \"Who answers the hyaena?\" growled Andoo, peering through the midnight  dimness at them, and then going to look at the cliff edge.    There was Ugh-lomi still telling his story, and the fire getting low,  and the scent of the burning hot and strong.    Andoo stood on the edge of the chalk cliff for some time, shifting his  vast weight from foot to foot, and swaying his head to and fro, with his  mouth open, his ears erect and twitching, and the nostrils of his big,  black muzzle sniffing. He was very curious, was the cave bear, more  curious than any of the bears that live now, and the flickering fire and  the incomprehensible movements of the man, let alone the intrusion into  his indisputable province, stirred him with a sense of strange new  happenings. He had been after red deer fawn that night, for the cave  bear was a miscellaneous hunter, but this quite turned him from that  enterprise.    \"Ya-ha!\" yelled the hyaenas behind. \"Ya-ha-ha!\"    Peering through the starlight, Andoo saw there were now three or four  going to and fro against the grey hillside. \"They will hang about me now  all the night ... until I kill,\" said Andoo. \"Filth of the world!\" And  mainly to annoy them, he resolved to watch the red flicker in the gorge  until the dawn came to drive the hyaena scum home. And after a time they  vanished, and he heard their voices, like a party of Cockney  beanfeasters, away in the beechwoods. Then they came slinking near  again. Andoo yawned and went on along the cliff, and they followed. Then  he stopped and went back.    It was a splendid night, beset with shining constellations, the same  stars, but not the same constellations we know, for since those days all  the stars have had time to move into new places. Far away across the  open space beyond where the heavy-shouldered, lean-bodied hyaenas  blundered and howled, was a beechwood, and the mountain slopes rose  beyond, a dim mystery, until their snow-capped summits came out white  and cold and clear, touched by the first rays of the yet unseen moon. It  was a vast silence, save when the yell of the hyaenas flung a vanishing  discordance across its peace, or when from down the hills the trumpeting  of the new-come elephants came faintly on the faint breeze. And below  now, the red flicker had dwindled and was steady, and shone a deeper  red, and Ugh-lomi had finished his story and was preparing to sleep, and  Eudena sat and listened to the strange voices of unknown beasts, and  watched the dark eastern sky growing deeply luminous at the advent of  the moon. Down below, the river talked to itself, and things unseen went  to and fro.    After a time the bear went away, but in an hour he was back again. Then,  as if struck by a thought, he turned, and went up the gorge....    The night passed, and Ugh-lomi slept on. The waning moon rose and lit  the gaunt white cliff overhead with a light that was pale and vague. The  gorge remained in a deeper shadow and seemed all the darker. Then by  imperceptible degrees, the day came stealing in the wake of the  moonlight. Eudena's eyes wandered to the cliff brow overhead once, and  then again. Each time the line was sharp and clear against the sky, and  yet she had a dim perception of something lurking there. The red of the  fire grew deeper and deeper, grey scales spread upon it, its vertical  column of smoke became more and more visible, and up and down the gorge  things that had been unseen grew clear in a colourless illumination. She  may have dozed.    Suddenly she started up from her squatting position, erect and alert,  scrutinising the cliff up and down.    She made the faintest sound, and Ugh-lomi too, light-sleeping like an  animal, was instantly awake. He caught up his axe and came noiselessly  to her side.    The light was still dim, the world now all in black and dark grey, and  one sickly star still lingered overhead. The ledge they were on was a  little grassy space, six feet wide, perhaps, and twenty feet long,  sloping outwardly, and with a handful of St. John's wort growing near  the edge. Below it the soft, white rock fell away in a steep slope of  nearly fifty feet to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river.  Down the river this slope increased, until some way off a thin grass  held its own right up to the crest of the cliff. Overhead, forty or  fifty feet of rock bulged into the great masses characteristic of  chalk, but at the end of the ledge a gully, a precipitous groove of  discoloured rock, slashed the face of the cliff, and gave a footing to a  scrubby growth, by which Eudena and Ugh-lomi went up and down.    They stood as noiseless as startled deer, with every sense expectant.  For a minute they heard nothing, and then came a faint rattling of dust  down the gully, and the creaking of twigs.    Ugh-lomi gripped his axe, and went to the edge of the ledge, for the  bulge of the chalk overhead had hidden the upper part of the gully. And  forthwith, with a sudden contraction of the heart, he saw the cave bear  half-way down from the brow, and making a gingerly backward step with  his flat hind-foot. His hind-quarters were towards Ugh-lomi, and he  clawed at the rocks and bushes so that he seemed flattened against the  cliff. He looked none the less for that. From his shining snout to his  stumpy tail he was a lion and a half, the length of two tall men. He  looked over his shoulder, and his huge mouth was open with the exertion  of holding up his great carcase, and his tongue lay out....    He got his footing, and came down slowly, a yard nearer.    \"Bear,\" said Ugh-lomi, looking round with his face white.    But Eudena, with terror in her eyes, was pointing down the cliff.    Ugh-lomi's mouth fell open. For down below, with her big fore-feet  against the rock, stood another big brown-grey bulk--the she-bear. She  was not so big as Andoo, but she was big enough for all that.    Then suddenly Ugh-lomi gave a cry, and catching up a handful of the  litter of ferns that lay scattered on the ledge, he thrust it into the  pallid ash of the fire. \"Brother Fire!\" he cried, \"Brother Fire!\" And  Eudena, starting into activity, did likewise. \"Brother Fire! Help, help!  Brother Fire!\"    Brother Fire was still red in his heart, but he turned to grey as they  scattered him. \"Br"]]]
