[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#11)"],[1," the specifications call for proportions by weight, assume a Portland  barrel to contain 380 lbs. of cement, and test the actual weight of a  cubic foot of the sand to be used. Sand varies extremely in weight, due  both to the variation in the per cent. of voids, and to the variation in  the kind of minerals of which the sand is composed. A quartz sand having  35 per cent. voids weighs 107 lbs. per cu. ft.; but a quartz sand  having 45 per cent. voids weighs only 91 lbs. per cu. ft. If the weight  of the sand must be guessed at, assume 100 lbs. per cu. ft. If the  specifications require a mixture of 1 cement to 2 of sand by weight, we  will have 380 lbs. (or 1 bbl.) of cement mixed with 2 × 380, or 760 lbs.  of sand; and if the sand weighs 90 lbs. per cu. ft., we shall have 760 ÷  90, or 8.44 cu. ft. of sand to every barrel of cement. In order to use  the tables above given, we may specify our own size of barrel; let us  say 4 cu. ft.; then 8.44 ÷ 4 gives 2.11 parts of sand by volume to 1  part of cement. Without material error we may call this a 1 to 2 mortar,  and use the tables, remembering that our barrel is now \"specified to be\"  4 cu. ft. If we have a brand of cement that yields 3.4 cu. ft. of paste  per bbl., and sand having 45 per cent. voids, we find that approximately  3 bbls. of cement per cu. yd. of mortar will be required.

It should be evident from the foregoing discussions that no table can be  made, and no rule can be formulated that will yield accurate results  unless the brand of cement is tested and the percentage of voids in the  sand determined. This being so the sensible plan is to use the tables  merely as a rough guide, and, where the quantity of cement to be used is  very large, to make a few batches of mortar using the available brands  of cement and sand in the proportions specified. Ten dollars spent in  this way may save a thousand, even on a comparatively small job, by  showing what cement and sand to select.    It will be seen that Tables XII and XIII can be condensed into the  following rule:    _Add together the number of parts and divide this sum into ten, the  quotient will be approximately the number of barrels of cement per cubic  yard._      TABLE XIII.--INGREDIENTS IN 1 CUBIC YARD OF CONCRETE.

Thus for a 1:2:5 concrete, the sum of the parts is 1 + 2 + 5, which is  8; then 10 ÷ 8 is 1.25 bbls., which is approximately equal to the 1.30  bbls. given in the table. Neither is this rule nor are the tables  applicable if a different size of cement barrel is specified, or if the  voids in the sand or stone differ materially from 40 per cent. to 45 per  cent. respectively. There are such innumerable combinations of varying  voids, and varying sizes of barrel, that the authors do not deem it  worth while to give other tables. The following amounts of cement per  cubic yard of mortar were determined by test:    ----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------  Authority       | Neat.|1 to 1|1 to 2|1 to 3|1 to 4|1 to 5|1 to 6|1 to 7|1 to 8  ----------------+-------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------                  | Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.| Bbls.

Sabin used a sand having 38 per cent. voids; Fuller used a sand having  45 per cent. voids; and Boardman used a sand having 38 per cent. voids.  It will be seen that the cement used by Sabin yielded 3.65 cu. ft. of  cement paste per bbl. (i. e. 27 ÷ 7.4), whereas the (Atlas) cement used  by Fuller yielded 3.4 cu. ft. of cement paste per bbl. Sabin found that  a barrel of cement measured 4.37 cu. ft. when dumped and measured loose.  Mr. Boardman states a barrel (380 lbs., net) of Lehigh Portland cement  yields 3.65 cu. ft. of cement paste; and that a barrel (265 lbs., net)  of Louisville natural cement yields 3.0 cu. ft. of cement paste.    Mr. J. J. R. Croes, M. Am. Soc. C. E., states that 1 bbl. of Rosendale  cement and 2 bbl. of sand (8 cu. ft.) make 9.7 cu. ft. of mortar, the  extreme variations from this average being 7 per cent.    Frequently concrete is made by mixing one volume of cement with a given  number of volumes of pit gravel; no sand being used other than the sand  that is found naturally mixed with the gravel. In such cases the cement  rarely increases the bulk of the gravel, hence Table XIV will give the  approximate amount of cement, assuming 1 cu. yd. of gravel per cubic  yard of concrete.      TABLE XIV.--SHOWING BARRELS OF CEMENT PER CUBIC YARD OF VARIOUS MIXTURES  OF CEMENT AND PIT GRAVEL.    ---------+------------------------------------------------------------  Spc.

This  superiority of dry mixtures it must be observed presupposes careful  deposition and thorough tamping, and these are tasks which are difficult  to have accomplished properly in actual construction work and which, if  accomplished properly, require time and labor. Wet mixtures readily flow  into the corners and angles of the forms and between and around the  reinforcing bars with only a small amount of puddling and slicing and  are, therefore, nearly always used because of the time and labor saved  in depositing and tamping. The following rule by which to determine the  percentage of water by weight for any given mixture of mortar for wet  concrete will be found satisfactory:    _Multiply the parts of sand by 8, add 24 to the product, and divide the  total by the sum of the parts of sand and cement._    For example if the percentage of water is required for a 1-3 mortar:         (3 × 8) + 24       ------------  = 12.             4    Hence the water should be 12 per cent. of the combined weight of cement  and sand. For a 1-1 mortar the rule gives 16 per cent.; for a 1-2 mortar  it gives 13½ per cent., and for a 1-6 mortar it gives 10.3 per cent.    To calculate the amount of water per cubic yard of 1-3-6 concrete for  example the procedure would be as follows: By the above rule a 1-3  mortar requires         (3 × 8) + 24       ------------ = 12 per cent. water.           4    A 1-3-6 concrete, according to Table XII, contains 1.05 bbls. cement and  0.44 cu. yd. sand.

You  will see great pastures fenced in with coyote-proof wire--pastures to be  used in lambing time so the young creatures will be safe from  prairie-dogs.\"    \"Do you have coyotes on the range?\"    \"Do we? Do we? Folks would know you for a tenderfoot right off if they  heard you ask that question! The coyote, I'd have you know, is the pest  of the sheepman. He's the meanest critter--but there, why be talking?  You'll see for yourself soon enough. The government has spent thousands  of dollars killing coyotes on these ranges.\"    \"To help the sheep-raisers?\"    \"So.\"    \"Well, I don't wonder my father wanted Crescent Ranch to pay its full  share for permits. Since we are getting all these advantages, we ought  to bear our part of the expense, oughtn't we?\" said Donald.    \"That's my feeling. We ought to be proud, too, we are bearing it. It's a  grand country! I wasn't born here, like you, but I came here as a child,  and the bones of my people are here. I mean to live in America and take  what it offers, and wouldn't I be the churl not to give the little I  can in return! I haven't money, but I can live up to the laws. Scotchman  though I be 'twill no hinder me from making a good American of myself.\"    \"Bully for you, Sandy!\" cried Donald. Then he added soberly: \"I am going  to be a better American when I get back home.\"    \"Dinna wait till then, laddie--be a better one now!\"    Sandy chanced to be deftly cutting the outline of a thistle on a spruce  staff he was carving for the boy. Donald watched him in silence as he  worked in the fading light. The sun had set behind the chain of near  hills, and the plateau where they were camping was gray with shadows.  Through the dusk they could see the flock lazily browsing among the  junipers.    Suddenly there was a cry from Sandy.    He threw down the staff and sprang to his feet.    \"The herd!\" he shouted. \"They're off!\"    Sure enough! Without a cry the leaders had started for the rimrock, and  in their wake--straight for the face of the precipice--was running the  entire flock.    \"They're startled!\" gasped Sandy. \"We must head 'em off. Run for your  life! We must get between the brainless creatures and the cliff before  they go over.\"    Donald ran. He had never run so before. His training as a track sprinter  stood him in good stead now. But he had never been a long-distance  runner. Two hundred yards was his limit. Moreover he was not in  training. But he ran--ran as he did not know he could run. He gained on  the sheep. Sandy, in the meantime, was waving his arms to the dogs who,  understanding his slightest motion, now dashed ahead. The sheep,  however, were far in advance by this time. On they sped in mad panic.  Donald could run no more. He began to lag, his heart beating like a  hammer. Even Sandy, who from the opposite direction was racing for the  edge of the rock, slackened his pace.    The race was a hopeless one.    Then without warning, out of the trees at the left side of the field  rode a horseman at full gallop. With flying hoofs he cut in ahead of  the herd just as they neared the face of the rock.    The leaders swerved, circled, and turned about. The gait of the  stampeding flock lessened. The dogs skilfully steered the approaching  sheep out to one side where Sandy scattered them that they might not  collide with the ranks coming toward them. Gradually the fears of the  flock became quieted. Falling into a walk they worked their way into  their customary places and turned about, feeding as they went.    Immediately when Sandy saw them safe he pressed forward to the side of  the horseman where he beckoned Donald to join him.    \"I spied your plight from the ridge above, Sandy McCulloch,\" called the  rider. \"The rest of the Crescent herd has gone in to the Reserve and I  have had my eye out for you for days. I thought it was about time that  you were coming along.\"    \"It's a good turn you've done me this day, Sargeant,\" Donald heard Sandy  say.    \"You have done many a favor for me.\"    \"Dinna be talking. It is little I ever did for you. An errand or two  perhaps, or carrying a message--but what is that? Any man would be glad  to do the same. To-night, though, you have saved my whole herd. We  should not have had a sheep left. Here is Master Donald Clark, the son  of our owner,\" went on Sandy, as Donald came nearer. \"Let him thank you.  Don, this soldier is one of the government rangers.\"    Leaning from his saddle the horseman put out his hand.    \"I am proud,\" he said, \"to meet one of the owners of Crescent Ranch. If  you are learning about the range, Master Clark, you cannot be in better  company than to be with Sandy McCulloch. There is little about sheeping  that he doesn't know; nor is there a cleaner-handed herder to be found.  We never need to see his permit or count his sheep. He is no  lawbreaker!\"    \"I hope none of our men are,\" replied Donald, shyly.    \"Crescent Ranch has always had the reputation of being run on the  square. We have no complaint to make,\" was the ranger's answer.    \"We--my father means that it shall be,\" the boy asserted modestly.    \"I do not doubt he does. You will have trouble, though, I fear, in  finding another manager who can match Old Angus--or even Johnson. They  were rare men who were famed throughout the county for their honesty and  common sense.\"    \"We shall try to find some other manager as good.\"    \"May you be so fortunate. Good luck to you!\"    With a wave of his hand the ranger cantered into the darkness and was  soon lost from sight.    \"You see, don't you, Don, that the rangers are not our natural born  enemies after all,\" said Sandy, with a good-humored smile that bared his  glistening teeth.    \"I should say not!\"    \"They are all like that if we but live up to our part of the bargain. I  never yet met a ranger who was not friendly and kind. But you cannot  have folks for your friends if you do not meet them half-way.\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VIII    DONALD HAS A SURPRISE      It was something of a disappointment when one morning a week or two  later the camp-tender, who had scrambled up over the rimrock, informed  Donald that he was to return to the central camp where his father would  meet him, and take him back to Crescent.    \"The ponies are tethered just below, so you can ride down along with  me,\" said the Mexican. \"There is nothing the matter, only your father  has more than he can do with but Thornton and Green to help him. He  needs you for a while. He told me to tell you that in a few weeks you  might come back.\"    Donald looked regretfully at Sandy.    \"I'm sorry to go, Sandy. I promised, though, that I would return to  Crescent whenever father wanted me; of course I am anxious to help him  all I can. I cannot realize that it is June, and that I have been two  months on the range. What a jolly time we have had! It seems a pity to  go and leave you here by yourself.\"    \"It would not be the first time I have been alone in the hills,\" smiled  Sandy.    \"He'll not be by himself either,\" put in Pete, the Mexican, \"for Tobin  came up over the trail with me and is to bear Sandy company.\"    Donald's face brightened.    \"I know you'll not be lonely, Sandy,\" he said, \"but suppose anything  happened to you--what if you happened to be hurt as Johnson was?\"    \"Aye, poor Johnson! What do they hear from him, Pete?\"    \"Mr. Clark has been to Glen City a number of times to see him. He is  getting on finely! The ribs are mending and the hip, too. His heart is  the trouble now; he is breaking his heart for Crescent and the range.  The doctor says that he will never be able to come back to the ranch.  Mr. Clark is going to settle him and his wife on a farm of their own in  California, where their son is.\"    \"Oh, I am very glad!\" cried Donald. \"Father said he should always look  out for Johnson because he had been so faithful.\"    \"It is like your father to do it--and like your grandfather, too, Don.  May you be as good a man! Now get your traps together and be off with  Pete. It's many a time I'll be thinking of you after you are gone,  laddie.\"    \"But you know I am coming back in a few weeks, Sandy.\"    \"There's long weeks and short weeks; it all depends on what you're  doing,\" was Sandy's whimsical answer. \"Now be off. Why, you'd think I  was seeing you to India instead of just down to the lowlands!\"    As he dropped over the rimrock, Donald tried to laugh. It was not until  he was mounted upon the little Mexican pony that he gained courage to  look up. Outlined against the sky Sandy was standing on a point of rock,  waving his sombrero. That was the last Donald saw of him.    Chatting as they rode down the mountainside the boy and Pete pressed  forward over the trail. At noon they dismounted and lunched on salt-pork  and pilot bread. Then off they cantered again. The tiny ponies,  sure-footed as mules, made their way over the steep inclines of the  hilly country with astonishing daintiness, but although they maintained  a fair and even speed it was sunset when the white top of the prairie  schooner came into sight, drawn up beside a stream and sheltered by a  group of great trees. Several Mexican ponies were pastured near it. The  curtains at the end of the wagon were parted and fastened back and  inside Donald could catch a glimpse of Manuel, the Mexican cook, busily  preparing the food. A curl of faint smoke rose from the tin pipe which  protruded through the canvas, arching the top of the wagon. Then as  Donald looked, into the clearing came the erect figure of his father.    [Illustration: THE PANTING PONY STOOD STILL]    The boy gave a shrill whistle on his fingers and touched the spurs to  his horse's flank.    \"Father!\" he called.    Another moment and the panting pony stood still near the wagon, his  sides heaving.    Donald dismounted and ran to meet his father.   "]]]
