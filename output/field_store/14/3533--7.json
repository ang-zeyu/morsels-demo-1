Except for those rare spirits that are born without sin, there is a  cavern of darkness to be traversed before that temple can be entered.  The gate of the cavern is despair, and its floor is paved with the  gravestones of abandoned hopes. There Self must die; there the  eagerness, the greed of untamed desire must be slain, for only so can  the soul be freed from the empire of Fate. But out of the cavern the  Gate of Renunciation leads again to the daylight of wisdom, by whose  radiance a new insight, a new joy, a new tenderness, shine forth to  gladden the pilgrim's heart.    When, without the bitterness of impotent rebellion, we have learnt  both to resign ourselves to the outward rule of Fate and to recognise  that the non-human world is unworthy of our worship, it becomes  possible at last so to transform and refashion the unconscious  universe, so to transmute it in the crucible of imagination, that a  new image of shining gold replaces the old idol of clay. In all the  multiform facts of the world--in the visual shapes of trees and  mountains and clouds, in the events of the life of man, even in the  very omnipotence of Death--the insight of creative idealism can find  the reflection of a beauty which its own thoughts first made. In this  way mind asserts its subtle mastery over the thoughtless forces of  Nature. The more evil the material with which it deals, the more  thwarting to untrained desire, the greater is its achievement in  inducing the reluctant rock to yield up its hidden treasures, the  prouder its victory in compelling the opposing forces to swell the  pageant of its triumph. Of all the arts, Tragedy is the proudest, the  most triumphant; for it builds its shining citadel in the very centre  of the enemy's country, on the very summit of his highest mountain;  from its impregnable watchtowers, his camps and arsenals, his columns  and forts, are all revealed; within its walls the free life continues,  while the legions of Death and Pain and Despair, and all the servile  captains of tyrant Fate, afford the burghers of that dauntless city  new spectacles of beauty. Happy those sacred ramparts, thrice happy  the dwellers on that all-seeing eminence. Honour to those brave  warriors who, through countless ages of warfare, have preserved for us  the priceless heritage of liberty, and have kept undefiled by  sacrilegious invaders the home of the unsubdued.    But the beauty of Tragedy does but make visible a quality which, in  more or less obvious shapes, is present always and everywhere in life.  In the spectacle of Death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and  in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an  overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the depth, the  inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange  marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of  sorrow. In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of  temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care  for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the  common life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft  illumined by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean  on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night  without, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness  of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual  soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command,  against the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its  hopes and fears. Victory, in this struggle with the powers of  darkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the  true initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence. From  that awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, renunciation,  wisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins.  To take into the inmost shrine of the soul the irresistible forces  whose puppets we seem to be--Death and change, the irrevocableness of  the past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the  universe from vanity to vanity--to feel these things and know them is  to conquer them.    This is the reason why the Past has such magical power. The beauty of  its motionless and silent pictures is like the enchanted purity of  late autumn, when the leaves, though one breath would make them fall,  still glow against the sky in golden glory. The Past does not change  or strive; like Duncan, after life's fitful fever it sleeps well; what  was eager and grasping, what was petty and transitory, has faded away,  the things that were beautiful and eternal shine out of it like stars  in the night. Its beauty, to a soul not worthy of it, is unendurable;  but to a soul which has conquered Fate it is the key of religion.    The life of Man, viewed outwardly, is but a small thing in comparison  with the forces of Nature. The slave is doomed to worship Time and  Fate and Death, because they are greater than anything he finds in  himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour.  But, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their  passionless splendour, is greater still. And such thought makes us  free men; we no longer bow before the inevitable in Oriental  subjection, but we absorb it, and make it a part of ourselves. To  abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of  temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things--this is  emancipation, and this is the free man's worship. And this liberation  is effected by a contemplation of Fate; for Fate itself is subdued by  the mind which leaves nothing to be purged by the purifying fire of  Time.    United with his fellow-men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a  common doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always,  shedding over every daily task the light of love. The life of Man is a  long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured  by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and  where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades  vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent  Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which  their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on  their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give  them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing  courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in  grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of  their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses,  that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are  fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with  ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their  evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to  feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was  the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their  hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave  words in which high courage glowed.    Brief and powerless is Man's life; on him and all his race the slow,  sure doom falls pitiless and dark. Blind to good and evil, reckless of  destruction, omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way; for Man,  condemned to-day to lose his dearest, to-morrow himself to pass  through the gate of darkness, it remains only to cherish, ere yet the  blow falls, the lofty thoughts that ennoble his little day; disdaining  the coward terrors of the slave of Fate, to worship at the shrine that  his own hands have built; undismayed by the empire of chance, to  preserve a mind free from the wanton tyranny that rules his outward  life; proudly defiant of the irresistible forces that tolerate, for a  moment, his knowledge and his condemnation, to sustain alone, a weary  but unyielding Atlas, the world that his own ideals have fashioned  despite the trampling march of unconscious power.

IV    THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS      In regard to every form of human activity it is necessary that the  question should be asked from time to time, What is its purpose and  ideal? In what way does it contribute to the beauty of human  existence? As respects those pursuits which contribute only remotely,  by providing the mechanism of life, it is well to be reminded that not  the mere fact of living is to be desired, but the art of living in the  contemplation of great things. Still more in regard to those  avocations which have no end outside themselves, which are to be  justified, if at all, as actually adding to the sum of the world's  permanent possessions, it is necessary to keep alive a knowledge of  their aims, a clear prefiguring vision of the temple in which creative  imagination is to be embodied.    The fulfilment of this need, in what concerns the studies forming the  material upon which custom has decided to train the youthful mind, is  indeed sadly remote--so remote as to make the mere statement of such a  claim appear preposterous. Great men, fully alive to the beauty of the  contemplations to whose service their lives are devoted, desiring that  others may share in their joys, persuade mankind to impart to the  successive generations the mechanical knowledge without which it is  impossible to cross the threshold. Dry pedants possess themselves of  the privilege of instilling this knowledge: they forget that it is to  serve but as a key to open the doors of the temple; though they spend  their lives on the steps leading up to those sacred doors, they turn  their backs upon the temple so resolutely that its very existence is  forgotten, and the eager youth, who would press forward to be  initiated to its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#11)"],[1,"way.  Sir Granby's orders were to place 'em in his lady's hands.\"    \"Quite right,\" said Roy.  \"But show them to me and let me see my  father's hand and seal.\"    \"Yes, that's right enough, sir,\" said the man.  \"We might be enemies;\"  and he unstrapped a wallet slung from his right shoulder, took out a  great letter tied with silk and sealed, and held it out, first on one  side, then upon the other, for the boy to see.    \"Yes,\" cried Roy, eagerly, \"that's my father's writing, and it is his  seal.  Open the gate, Jenkin, and let them in.  Why, my lads, you look  worn-out.\"    \"Not quite, sir; but we've had a rough time of it.  The country's full  of crop-ears, and we've had our work cut out to get here safe.\"    \"Full of what?\" said Roy, staring, as the troopers led in their horses,  and he walked beside the man who bore the despatches.    \"Crop-ears, sir,--Parliamentary men.\"    \"Is it so bad as that?\"    \"Bad?  Yes, sir.\"    \"But my father--how is he?\"    \"Well and hearty when he sent us off, sir.\"    \"Come quickly then,\" cried Roy, hurrying the men along to the great  drawbridge, over which the horses' hoofs began to rattle loudly.  But  they had not gone half-way across the moat before there was the rustle  of a dress in front, and, looking ghastly pale and her eyes wild with  excitement, Lady Royland came hurrying to meet them.    Roy sprang to her, crying--    \"Letters from father, and he is quite well!\"    He caught his mother in his arms, for her eyes closed and she reeled and  would have fallen; but the next minute she had recovered her composure,  and held out her hand for the packet the trooper had taken from his  wallet.    \"Thank you,\" she said, smiling.  \"Martlet, take these poor tired fellows  into the hall at once, and see that they have every attention.  Set some  one to feed their horses.\"    \"Thank you, my lady,\" said the man, with rough courtesy, as he took off  his steel cap.    \"Ah, you are wounded,\" cried Lady Royland, with a look of horror.    \"Only a scratch, my lady.  My comrade here is worse than I.\"    \"Your wounds shall be seen to at once.\"    \"If I might speak, my lady, a place to sit down for an hour or two, and  something to eat and drink, would do us more good than a doctor.  We  haven't had a good meal since we rode away from Whitehall and along the  western road a week ago.\"    \"Eight days and a harf, comrad',\" growled one of his companions.    \"Is it?  Well, I haven't kept count.\"    \"See to them at once, Martlet,\" said Lady Royland; and the horses were  led off, while, clinging to her son's arm, the anxious wife and mother  hurried into the library, threw herself into a chair, tore open the  great letter, and began, wild-eyed and excited, to read, while Roy  walked up and down the room with his eyes fixed longingly upon the  despatch till he could bear it no longer.    \"Oh, mother!\" he cried, \"do, do, do pray give me a little bit of the  news.\"    \"My poor boy! yes.  How selfish of me.  Roy, dear, there is something  terribly wrong!  Your dear father says he has been half-mad with  anxiety, for he has sent letter after letter, and has had no news from  us.  So at last he determined to send his own messengers, and despatched  five men to guard this letter to us--but I saw only three.\"    \"No,\" said Roy, solemnly; \"the roads are in the hands of the enemy,  mother, and two of the poor fellows were killed on the way.  Two of  these three are wounded.\"    \"Yes, yes!  Horrible!  I could not have thought matters were so bad as  this.\"    \"But father is quite well?\"    \"Yes, yes, my dear; but he says the king's state is getting desperate,  and that he will have to take the field at once.  But the letters I  sent--that he sent, my boy?\"    \"They must have all fallen into the enemy's hands, mother.  How bad  everything must be!  But pray, pray, go on.  What does he say?\"    Lady Royland read on in silence for a few moments, and, as she read, the  pallor in her face gave way to a warm flush of excitement, while Roy, in  spite of his eagerness to hear more, could not help wondering at the  firmness and decision his mother displayed, an aspect which was  supported by her words as she turned to her son.    \"Roy,\" she cried, \"I was obliged to read first, but you shall know  everything.  While we have been here in peace, it seems that a terrible  revolution has broken out, and your father says that it will only be by  desperate efforts on the part of his friends that the king's position  can be preserved.  He says that these efforts will be made, and that the  king shall be saved.\"    \"Hurrah!\" shouted the boy, wildly.  \"God save the king!\"    \"God save the king!\" murmured Lady Royland, softly, with her eyes  closed; and her words sounded like a prayerful echo of her son's  utterance.    There was a pause for a few moments, and then Lady Royland went on.    \"Your father says that we lie right out of the track of the trouble  here, and that he prays that nothing may disturb us; but as the country  grows more unsettled with the war, evil men will arise everywhere, ready  to treat the laws of the country with contempt, and that it is our duty  in his absence to be prepared.\"    \"Prepared!  Yes, mother,\" cried Roy, excitedly; and he flung himself  upon his knees, rested his elbows on his mother's lap, and seized her  hands.  \"Go on, go on!\"    \"He says that you have grown a great fellow now, and that the time has  come for you to play the man, and fill his place in helping me in every  way possible.\"    \"Father says that, mother?\" cried the boy, flushing scarlet.    \"Yes; and that he looks to you to be my counsellor, and, with the help  of his faithful old servant Martlet, to do everything you can to put the  place in a state of defence.\"    \"Why, mother,\" said Roy, \"old Ben will go mad with delight.\"    Lady Royland suppressed a sigh, and went on firmly.    \"He bids me use my discretion to decide whom among the tenants and  people of the village I can--we can--trust, Roy, and to call upon them  to be ready, in case of an emergency, to come in here and help to  protect the place and their own belongings; but to be very careful whom  I do trust, for an enemy within the gates is a terrible danger.\"    \"Yes, of course,\" cried Roy, whose head seemed once more in a whirl.    \"He goes on to say that there may not be the slightest necessity for all  this, but the very fact of our being prepared will overawe people who  might be likely to prove disaffected, and will keep wandering bands of  marauders at a distance.\"    \"Of course--yes; I see,\" cried Roy, eagerly.  \"Yes, mother, I'll go to  work at once.\"    \"You will do nothing foolish, I know, my boy,\" said the mother, laying  one hand upon his head and gazing proudly in his eyes.    \"Nothing if I can help it,\" he cried; \"and I'll consult you in  everything, but--but--\"    \"Yes, my boy, speak out.\"    \"I don't want to hurt your feelings, dear, and yet if I speak of a sword  or a gun--\"    Lady Royland shivered slightly, but she drew a long, deep breath, and  raised herself up proudly.    \"Roy,\" she said, \"that was in times of peace, before this terrible  emergency had arisen.  As a woman, I shrink from bloodshed and  everything that suggests it.  It has been my constant dread that you, my  boy, should follow your father's profession.  `My boy a soldier!'  I  said, as I lay sleepless of a night, and I felt that I could not bear  the thought.  But Heaven's will be done, my son.  The time has come when  my weak, womanly fears must be crushed down, and I must fulfil my duty  as your dear father's wife.  We cannot question his wisdom.  A terrible  crisis has come upon our land, and we must protect ourselves and those  who will look to us for help.  Then, too, your father calls upon us to  try to save his estate here from pillage and the ruthless wrecking of  wicked men.  Roy, my boy, I hope I shall not be such a weak woman now,  but your help and strengthener, as you will be mine.  You will not hurt  my feelings, dear, in what you do.  You see,\" she continued, smiling, as  she laid her hand upon the hilt of the sword the lad had so hastily  buckled on, \"I do not wince and shudder now.  Fate has decided upon your  career, Roy, young as you are, and I know that my son's sword, like his  father's, will never be drawn unless it is to protect the weak and  maintain the right.\"    \"Never, mother,\" cried the boy, enthusiastically; and as Lady Royland  tried to raise him, he sprang to his feet.  \"Oh,\" he cried, \"I wish I  were not such a boy!\"    \"I do not,\" said his mother, smiling.  \"You are young, and I am only a  woman, but our cause will make us strong, Roy.  There,\" she continued,  embracing him lovingly, \"the time has come to act.  You will consult  with Martlet what to do about the defences at once, while I write back  to your father.  When do you think the men will be fit to go back?\"    \"They'd go to-night, mother; they seem to be just the fellows; but their  horses want two or three days' rest.\"    \"Roy!\"    \"Yes, mother.  It's a long journey, and they'll have to go by  out-of-the-way roads to avoid attack.\"    \"But we have horses.\"    \"Yes, mother, but they would sooner trust their own.\"    Lady Royland bowed her head.    \"The letters must go back by them,\" she said, \"and they must start at  the earliest minute they can.  But there is another thing.  It is right  that Master Pawson should be taken into our counsels.\"    \"Master Pawson, mother?\"    \"Yes, my boy.  He is your father's trusted servant, and I must not  slight any friends.  Go and ask him to come here.\"    \"Can't,\" said Roy, shortly.  \"He went out this morning, and said he  didn't think he would be back to dinner.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Gone over to see the vicar.\"    \"Gone to Mr Meldew,\" said Lady Royland, whose face looked very grave.  \"Then it must be deferred till his return.  Now, Roy, what will you do  first?\"    \"See to the gates, mother, and that no one goes out or comes in"]]]
