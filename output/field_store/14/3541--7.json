Mr. Bryant told me to tell you to send  him right away.\"    Peter needed no second bidding. Down the stairs he flew.    Only yesterday he had longed for a chance to prove his friendship for  Nat. Now, all unsolicited, the opportunity had come.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VI    TWO PETERS AND WHICH WON      Aflutter with anxiety, Peter followed the messenger back to the  beamhouse.    Of all people why should this calamity come to Jackson? In addition to  the suffering that must of necessity accompany such a disaster Peter  reflected, as he went along, that Nat could ill afford to lose his wages  and incur the expense of doctor's bills. Poor Nat! It seemed as if he  had none of the good luck he deserved--only disappointment and  misfortune.    Peter found his chum stretched on the floor in a dark little entry  adjoining the workroom, with Bryant keeping guard.    \"I am down and out this time, no mistake, Pete!\" called Nat with a  rather dubious attempt to be cheerful. \"You see what happens when you go  off into another department and leave me. I was all right while you were  here.\"    Peter knelt beside him.    \"I'm mighty sorry, old chap,\" he said. \"Does it hurt much?\"    As Jackson tried to turn, his lips whitened with pain.    \"Well, rather! I guess, though, I'll be all right in a few days. It's  only a sprain.\"    As Peter glanced questioningly at Bryant, who was standing in the  shadow, the older man shook his head and put his finger to his lips.    \"Well, anyway, Nat,\" answered Peter, trying to feign a gaiety he did not  feel, \"you will at least get a vacation. I told you only the other day  you needed one.\"    \"I don't need it any more than you do, Peter. Besides I can't stop work,  no matter what happens. What would become of my mother, and who would  pay our rent if my money stopped coming in? No sir-e-e! I shall get  this foot bandaged up and be back at the tannery to-morrow. The doctor  can fix it so I can keep at work, can't he, Mr. Bryant?\"    \"I hope so, Jackson,\" replied Bryant, kindly. \"We'll see when he comes.\"    But the doctor was far less optimistic. He examined the ankle,  pronounced it fractured, and ordered Nat to the hospital where an X-ray  could be taken before the bones were set.    Nat, who had endured the pain like a Spartan, burst into tears.    \"What will become of us--of my mother, Peter?\" he moaned.    \"Now don't you get all fussed up, Nat,\" said Peter soothingly. \"Leave  things to me. I'll take care of your mother and attend to the house  rent. I have plenty of money. You know I have been saving it up ever  since I came here.\"    \"Oh, but Peter--I couldn't think of taking your money!\" Nat protested.    \"Stuff! Of course you can take it! I should like to know whose money you  would take if not mine. Anyway you can't help yourself. I have you in  my power now and you've got to do just as I say.\"    \"But I don't see how I can ever pay it back, Peter.\"    \"No matter.\"    \"It does matter.\"    \"Well, well! We will settle all that later. Don't worry about it. I am  only too thankful that I have the money to help you out,\" was Peter's  earnest response. \"I'd be a great kind of a chum if I didn't stick by  you when you are in a hole like this. You'd do the same for me.\"    \"You bet I would!\"    \"Of course! Well, what's the difference?\"    \"I'm afraid I'll have to take you at your word, Peter,\" agreed Nat  reluctantly, after an interval of reflection. \"I do not just see what  else I can do at present.\"    \"That's the way to talk,\" cried Peter triumphantly. \"I'll look out for  everything. See! They have come with a motor-car to take you to the  hospital! You are going to have your long-coveted ride in an automobile,  Nat.\"    Nat laughed in spite of himself.    \"I'm not so keen about it as I was.\"    Gently the men lifted him in and the doctor followed.    \"I'll be out in a week, Peter--sure thing!\" called Nat shutting his lips  tightly together to stifle a moan as the car shot ahead.    \"A week, indeed!\" sniffed Bryant, as he turned away. \"It'll be nearer a  month. So Jackson has a mother to look after, has he?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, suppose you go right over there and ease her mind about this  accident before she hears of it through somebody else. Tell her there is  no cause for alarm. The boy will have the best of care at the hospital,  and she can go there and see him every day during visiting hours.\"    \"And you think it will be a month before he will be about again, Mr.  Bryant?\" questioned Peter, anxiously.    \"Oh, I'm no doctor. How can I tell?\" was Bryant's somewhat testy answer.  \"One thing is certain, however; he won't be here again this week.  Sprint along.\"    And so it was Peter Strong who bore the sorry tidings to Nat's mother,  and who cheered and encouraged her as affectionately as if he had been  her own son; it was also Peter who, during the weeks that followed, paid  the Jacksons' rent and provided sufficient funds for living expenses.  How he blessed his motorcycle savings! Without them he never could have  helped Nat at this time when help was so sorely needed. Far from  begrudging the money Peter exulted in spending it. A motorcycle seemed  singularly unimportant when contrasted with a crisis like this. Yet  magnificent as his little fortune had seemed it dwindled rapidly. How  much everything cost! How had Nat ever managed to keep soul and body  together on what he earned? Peter's savings melted like the snows before  the warm spring sunshine, and one day the lad awoke to the fact that  there was no more money in the bank and that Nat's mother was absolutely  dependent for food upon his daily earnings. It was a new sensation and  a startling one--to know that you must work--that if you stopped some  one dear to you would go hungry.    Poor Peter!    He now had a spur indeed--an incentive to toil as he never had toiled  before!    Stuart was delighted with his recently acquired pupil.    \"He is as steady a little chap as you would care to see,\" he told Bryant  when they met in the yard one day. \"And he is bright as a button, too.  Already he has caught on to the various finishing processes and is as  handy as any of the men in the department. And then he is such a well  spoken lad; not like many of the boys who come into the tannery. He must  have come of good family. Do you know anything about his people?\"    \"Not a thing. I've heard that Mr. Coddington got him his job in the  first place, but that may not be true; I think, though, it is more than  likely, because they have pushed him ahead faster than is customary. But  at any rate the boy has made good, no matter who started him. He will  be at the top of the ladder yet.\"    Peter Strong, however, was not thinking at the present time of the top  of the ladder. His mind was entirely set upon relieving the worry of his  sick chum and providing the necessary comforts for Mrs. Jackson. Only on  Saturdays had he time to go to the hospital and see Nat; but he wrote  long letters--jolly, cheery letters, which he dashed off every night  before going to bed.    \"About every man in the tannery has inquired for you, Nat,\" he wrote,  \"and pretty soon I am going to charge a fee for information. Your mother  is all right, and declares that she now has two sons instead of one. You  better hurry up and come home, or she may decide she likes me better  than she does you!\"    How Nat laughed when he read that message! The very idea!    Of all this busy life and its varied interests Peter's family knew  nothing. His father and mother had gone for a month's trip to the  Catskills and there was no one but the servants at home to tell his  troubles to had he wished to unburden his worries. So he plodded  bravely on alone. How glad he was that the beamhouse was left behind,  and that during those warm September days he could work in a large,  well-ventilated room where there was fresher air. Perhaps, however, he  grew a little thin under his unaccustomed load of anxiety, for when his  father and mother returned from their vacation Peter was conscious more  than once of his father's fixed gaze, and one evening when the boy was  going to bed there was a knock at the door and Mr. Coddington entered  the room. For a few seconds he roamed uneasily about, straightening a  picture here and an ornament there; then he said abruptly:    \"Well, Peter--the summer is almost over. Here it is nearly the middle of  September! I fancy the weeks have gone pretty slowly with your friend  Strong. What do you say to quitting the tannery and going back to  school?\"    Peter's breath almost stopped. He had not dreamed of leaving his work.  Such a myriad of thoughts arose at the bare suggestion that he could not  answer.    Mr. Coddington misunderstood his silence.    \"Of course you are astonished, my boy, and not a little glad, I imagine.  When I sent you to the tannery, however, I did not intend to keep you  there permanently. I simply wanted to wake you up to doing something and  make you prove the stuff you were made of. You have done that and more  too. I have heard nothing but the best reports, and I am proud of you,  Peter. The tannery has served its purpose for the present. Suppose we  leave it now for a while.\"    Still Peter did not speak.    \"Perhaps you are disappointed to stop short of earning money enough for  your motorcycle,\" suggested Mr. Coddington, puzzled by the lad's  silence. \"Is that it? Tell me now, how much would you need to put with  what you have already saved? Do you recall the sum you have in the  bank?\"    \"I haven't any money in the bank, Father,\" was Peter's unwilling reply.    \"What! Not a cent?\"    Peter shook his head.    \"Have you drawn it out and spent it all?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I'm sorry to hear that--sorry, and a little disappointed. However, we  mustn't expect too much of you. Come now, what do you say to my  proposition of returning to school?\"    \"I can't do it, sir.\"    \"What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#11)"],[1,"opposition papers,  which immediately attacked the Governor for what they called his illegal  interference and his brutality. The _Gazette_ filled its columns with  the most fulsome flattery in his defence, and Darling himself was so  imprudent as to mingle in the dispute, and to do what he could to annoy  the editors of the two hostile papers. Very soon the whole colony was  divided into two great classes--the one needlessly extolling the  Governor, the other denouncing him as the most cowardly and brutal of  men. For four years this abusive warfare lasted, till at length the  opponents of Darling won the day; and in 1831 he was recalled by the  English Government.      #7. Governor Bourke.#--Sir Richard Bourke, who succeeded him, was the most  able and the most popular of all the Sydney Governors. He had the talent  and energy of Macquarie; but he had, in addition, a frank and hearty  manner, which insensibly won the hearts of the colonists, who, for years  after his departure, used to talk affectionately of him as the \"good old  Governor Bourke\". During his term of office the colony continued in a  sober way to make steady progress. In 1833 its population numbered  60,000, of whom 36,000 were free persons. Every year there arrived three  thousand fresh convicts; but as an equal number of free immigrants also  arrived, the colony was benefited by its annual increase of population.    [Illustration: ST. ANDREW'S CATHEDRAL, SYDNEY.]      #8. The Land Question.#--Governor Bourke, on his landing, found that much  discontent existed with reference to what was called the Land Question.  It was understood that any one who applied for land to the Government,  and showed that he would make a good use of it, would receive a suitable  area as a free grant. But many abuses crept in under this system. In  theory, all men had an equal right to obtain the land they required;  but, in practice, it was seldom possible for one who had no friends  among the officials at Sydney to obtain a grant. An immigrant had often  to wait for months, and see his application unheeded; while, meantime, a  few favoured individuals were calling day by day at the Land Office, and  receiving grant after grant of the choicest parts of the colony.  Governor Bourke, under instructions from the English Parliament, made a  new arrangement. There were to be no more free grants. In the settled  districts all land was to be put up for auction; if less than five  shillings an acre was offered, it was not to be sold; when the offers  rose above that price, it was to be given to the highest bidder. This  was regarded as a very fair arrangement; and, as a large sum of money  was annually received from the sale of land, the Government was able to  resume the practice, discontinued in 1818, of assisting poor people to  emigrate from Europe to the colony.      #9. The Squatters.#--Beyond the surveyed districts the land was occupied  by squatters, who settled down where they pleased, but had no legal  right to their \"runs,\" as they were called. With regard to these lands  new regulations were urgently required; for the squatters, who were  liable to be turned off at a moment's notice, felt themselves in a very  precarious position. Besides, as their sheep increased rapidly, and the  flocks of neighbouring squatters interfered with one another, violent  feuds sprang up, and were carried on with much bitterness. To put an end  to these evils Governor Bourke ordered the squatters to apply for the  land they required. He promised to have boundaries marked out; but gave  notice that he would, in future, charge a rent in proportion to the  number of sheep the land could support. In return, he would secure to  each squatter the peaceable occupation of his run until the time came  when it should be required for sale. This regulation did much to secure  the stability of squatting interests in New South Wales.    After ruling well and wisely for six years, Governor Bourke retired in  the year 1837, amid the sincere regrets of the whole colony.          CHAPTER VII.    DISCOVERIES IN THE INTERIOR, 1817-1836.      #1. Oxley.#--After the passage over the Blue Mountains had been  discovered--in 1813--and the beautiful pasture land round Bathurst had  been opened up to the enterprise of the squatters, it was natural that  the colonists should desire to know something of the nature and  capabilities of the land which stretched away to the west. In 1817 they  sent Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General, to explore the country towards the  interior, directing him to follow the course of the Lachlan and discover  the ultimate \"fate,\" as they called it, of its waters. Taking with him a  small party, he set out from the settled districts on the Macquarie, and  for many days walked along the banks of the Lachlan, through undulating  districts of woodland and rich meadow. But, after a time, the explorers  could perceive that they were gradually entering upon a region of  totally different aspect; the ground was growing less and less hilly;  the tall mountain trees were giving place to stunted shrubs; and the  fresh green of the grassy slopes was disappearing. At length they  emerged on a great plain, filled with dreary swamps, which stretched as  far as the eye could reach, like one vast dismal sea of waving reeds.  Into this forbidding region they penetrated, forcing their way through  the tangled reeds and over weary miles of oozy mud, into which they sank  almost to the knees at every step. Ere long they had to abandon this  effort to follow the Lachlan throughout its course; they therefore  retraced their steps, and, striking to the south, succeeded in going  round the great swamp which had opposed their progress. Again they  followed the course of the river for some distance, entering, as they  journeyed, into regions of still greater desolation; but again they were  forced to desist by a second swamp of the same kind. The Lachlan here  seemed to lose itself in interminable marshes, and as no trace could be  found of its further course, Oxley concluded that they had reached the  end of the river. As he looked around on the dreary expanse, he  pronounced the country to be \"for ever uninhabitable\"; and, on his  return to Bathurst, he reported that, in this direction at least, there  was no opening for enterprise. The Lachlan, he said, flows into an  extensive region of swamps, which are perhaps only the margin of a great  inland sea.    Oxley was afterwards sent to explore the course of the Macquarie River,  but was as little successful in this as in his former effort. The river  flowed into a wide marsh, some thirty or forty miles long, and he was  forced to abandon his purpose; he started for the eastern coast, crossed  the New England Range, and descended the long woodland slopes to the  sea, discovering on his way the river Hastings.      #2. Allan Cunningham.#--Several important discoveries were effected by an  enthusiastic botanist named Allan Cunningham, who, in his search for new  plants, succeeded in opening up country which had been previously  unknown. In 1825 he found a passage over the Liverpool Range, through a  wild and picturesque gap, which he called the Pandora Pass; and on the  other side of the mountains he discovered the fine pastoral lands of the  Liverpool Plains and the Darling Downs, which are watered by three  branches of the Upper Darling--the Peel, the Gwydir, and the Dumaresq.  The squatters were quick to take advantage of these discoveries; and,  after a year or two, this district was covered with great flocks of  sheep. It was here that the Australian Agricultural Company formed their  great stations already referred to.      #3. Hume and Hovell.#--The southern coasts of the district now called  Victoria had been carefully explored by Flinders and other sailors, but  the country which lay behind these coasts was quite unknown. In 1824  Governor Brisbane suggested a novel plan of exploration; he proposed to  land a party of convicts at Wilson's Promontory, with instructions to  work their way through the interior to Sydney, where they would receive  their freedom. The charge of the party was offered to Hamilton Hume, a  young native of the colony, and a most expert and intrepid bushman. He  was of an energetic and determined, though somewhat domineering  disposition, and was anxious to distinguish himself in the work of  exploration. He declined to undertake the expedition in the manner  proposed by Governor Brisbane, but offered to conduct a party of  convicts from Sydney to the southern coasts. A sea-captain named Hovell  asked permission to accompany him. With these two as leaders, and six  convict servants to make up the party, they set out from Lake George,  carrying their provisions in two carts, drawn by teams of oxen. As soon  as they met the Murrumbidgee their troubles commenced; the river was so  broad and swift that it was difficult to see how they could carry their  goods across. Hume covered the carts with tarpaulin, so as to make them  serve as punts. Then he swam across the river, carrying the end of a  rope between his teeth; and with this he pulled over the loaded punts.  The men and oxen then swam across, and once more pushed forward. But the  country through which they had now to pass was so rough and woody that  they were obliged to abandon their carts and load the oxen with their  provisions. They journeyed on, through hilly country, beneath the shades  of deep and far-spreading forests; to their left they sometimes caught a  glimpse of the snow-capped peaks of the Australian Alps, and at length  they reached the banks of a clear and rapid stream, which they called  the Hume, but which is now known as the Murray. Their carts being no  longer available, they had to construct boats of wicker-work and cover  them with tarpaulin. Having crossed the river, they entered the lightly  timbered slopes to the north of Victoria, and holding"]]]
