Yours,            HORACE GREELEY.         MRS. J. S. GRIFFING, Washington, D. C.                                                        _Sept. 12, 1870_.       HORACE GREELEY:         DEAR SIR:--Much as I respect your judgment, and admire your       candor, I must express entire dissent with your views in       reference to those who are laboring to befriend the Freedmen, and       also of your estimate of the character of the black race.         When you condemn my work for the old slaves, who can not labor,       and are \"crowded into Washington\" by force of events       uncontrollable, as a \"great injury,\" I am at a loss to perceive       your estimate of any and all benevolent action. If, to provide       houses, food, clothing, and other physical comforts, to those       broken-down aged slaves whom we have liberated in their declining       years, when all their strength is gone, and for whom no home,       family friendship, or subsistence is furnished; if this is a       \"great injury,\" in my judgment there is no call for alms-house,       hospital, home, or asylum in human society, and all       appropriations of sympathy and material aid are worse than       useless, and demand your earnest rebuke and discountenance, and       to the unfortunates crowded into these institutions, you should       say, \"You must find work, go out and seek it.\" So far as an       humble individual can be, I am substituting to these a freedman's       (relief) bureau; sanitary commission; church sewing society, to       aid the poor; orphan asylum; old people's home; hospital and       alms-house for the sick and the blind; minister-at-large, to       visit the sick, console the dying, and bury the dead; and wherein       I fail, and perhaps you discriminate, is the want of wealthy,       popular, and what is called honorable associations. Were these at       my command, with the field before me, it would be easy to       illustrate the practical use as well as the divine origin of the       Golden Rule.         If, in your criticism, you refer to my secondary department in       which I have labored to furnish employment to the Freedmen both       in the District and out, is it not a direct reflection upon all       efforts made for the distribution of labor? Is my course more       aggravating to the weakness of destitute unemployed freed people,       than emigrant societies, intelligence offices, benevolent ladies'       societies, and young men's Christian associations, to give work       to the poor of all nations; and lastly the Government Indian       department, that has wisely called to its aid the American       missionary, and the Quaker societies, to farm out the poor       Indians? or, if the measures put forth by these admissible agents       can raise the ambition and stimulate to self-reliance their       beneficiaries, will you be good enough to show wherein the same       means, which I claim to employ, must have the opposite effect       upon the freedmen crowded into Washington.         Is it possible that the swarming of the Irish, Swiss, and German       poor, to the city of New York, is attributable to the       intelligence offices and immigration societies of your city, and       not, as we have supposed, to the want of work and bread at home,       and is there really a danger, that in providing and calculating       for them, we shall strengthen the argument of race, while our       institutions of charity are filled with descendants of the Saxon,       the Norman, the Goth, and the Vandal? I think not.                             Respectfully yours,    JOSEPHINE S. GRIFFING.           _From the New National Era._         MRS. JOSEPHINE S. GRIFFING THE ORIGINATOR OF THE FREEDMEN's       BUREAU.         This truly excellent and noble woman was fitly spoken of in the       _New National Era_ just after her death, but at that early date       it was not possible to obtain the facts to prove the statement at       the head of this article, which is but simple truth and historic       justice.         Mrs. Griffing was engaged in an arduous work for the Loyal League       in the Northwest in 1862, and foresaw the need of a comprehensive       system of protection, help, and education, for the slaves in the       trying transition of freedom. She sought counsel and aid from fit       persons in Ohio and Michigan, and came here only in 1863 to begin       her work of urging the plan of a Bureau for that purpose. Nothing       daunted by coldness or indifference she nobly persisted, until in       December, 1863, a bill for a Bureau of Emancipation was       introduced in the House of Representatives by Hon T. D. Elliott,       of Massachusetts. After some changes in the bill, and a committee       of conference of the House and Senate, and the valuable aid of       Sumner, Wilson, and other Senators, the bill for the Freedman's       Bureau finally passed in March, 1865, and was signed by President       Lincoln just before his assassination.         The original idea was Mrs. Griffing's; her untiring efforts gave       it life, and it is but just that the colored people, of the South       especially, should bear in grateful remembrance this able and       gentle woman, whose life and strength were spent for their poor       sufferers, and who called into useful existence that great       national charity, the Freedman's Bureau.    The following letter from William Lloyd Garrison to Giles B. Stebbins,  then in Washington, corroborates the above statements:                                         ROXBURY, MASS., _March 4, 1872_.         MY DEAR FRIEND: ... I was glad to see the well-merited tributes       paid by yourself and others to the memory of Mrs. Josephine S.       Griffing. She was, for a considerable period, actively engaged in       the anti-slavery struggle in Ohio, where by her rare executive       ability and persuasiveness as a public lecturer, she aided       greatly in keeping the abolition flag flying, enlightening and       changing public sentiment, and hastening the year of jubilee.       With what unremitting zeal and energy did she espouse the cause       of the homeless, penniless, benighted, starving freedmen, driven       by stress of circumstances into the national capital in such       overwhelming numbers; and what a multitude were befriended and       saved through her moving appeals in their behalf! How like an       angel of mercy must she have seemed to them all! No doubt the       formation of the Freedman's Bureau was mainly due to her       representations as to its indispensable necessity; and how much       good was done by that instrumentality in giving food, clothing,       and protection to those who were so suddenly brought out of the       house of bondage, as against the ferocity of the rebel element,       it is difficult to compute because of its magnitude. She deserves       to be gratefully remembered among \"the honorable women not a       few,\" who, in their day and generation, have been        \"Those starry lights of virtue that diffuse,      Through the dark depths of time their vital flame,\"         whose self-abnegation and self-sacrifice in the cause of       suffering humanity having been absolute, and who have nobly       vindicated every claim made by their sex to full equality with       men in all that serves to dignify human nature. Her rightful       place is among \"the noble army of martyrs,\" for her life was       undoubtedly very much shortened by her many cares and heavy       responsibilities and excessive labors in behalf of the pitiable       objects of her sympathy and regard.                             Very truly yours,     WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.           PARKER PILLSBURY, in a letter to Mrs. Stebbins says: \"The       anti-slavery conflict could never boast a braver, truer, abler       advocate than Josephine Griffing. It was always an honor and       inspiration to stand by her side, no matter how fierce the       encounter. I have seen her when an infuriated mob assailed our       Conventions, and dashed down doors, windows, seats, stoves,       tables, everything that would yield to their demoniac rage, stand       amid the ruins calm and unmoved, and with her gentle words of       remonstrance shame the intruders, until one by one they shrank       away, glad to get out of her sight.         Her beautiful home hospitalities; her warm welcome ever extended       to the faithful friends of freedom and humanity, were equal to       her unshaken courage and self-control in public assemblies. We       used to call that humble home in Litchfield, 'The Saint's Rest,'       and such it was to many a fugitive slave, as well as soldier in       his cause.    To the first demand for the enfranchisement of women in 1848, Mrs.  Griffing heartily responded, and in this reform she was ever untiring  in effort, wise in counsel, and eminent in public speech. In 1867 she  helped to organize the Universal Franchise Association of the District  of Columbia, of which she was president for years. She was also  Corresponding Secretary of the National Woman Suffrage Association,  and was ever considered the organizing power at Washington. She first  suggested the importance of annual conventions at the capital, in  order to influence Congressional action.    Mrs. Griffing's last appearance in public was at the May Anniversary  of the National Woman Suffrage Association, held in New York in 1871,  and so feeble was her condition that a screen was placed behind her to  enable the audience to hear her voice. At the close of the Convention  she went to the home of her childhood, in Hebron, Conn., hoping that  the bracing air of the New England hills would give her new life and  strength,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#11)"],[1,"school, was very much impressed by       what he saw and learned there concerning not only the       taming, but the reforming and refining influence of a       'concord of sweet sounds.' Attached to the institution is a       music-teacher, who has at all times in active training a       number of boys, who perform on the various instruments that       make up a brass band. This teacher, who is an intelligent       German, and to all appearances an able instructor, testifies       to the wonderful efficacy of music in softening the rugged       nature of the boys, who are sent to school usually because       they are uncontrollable by their parents or guardians. He       says he has noticed the singular fact, that boys whose       aversion to learning was so great that they could not or       would not acquire even a knowledge of their 'a, b, abs,'       took hold with evident relish of the comparatively difficult       study of theoretical music, and in a very short space of       time mastered the notes sufficiently to be able to read a       tolerably hard score or piece of music. This seemed to him       like a phenomenal phase, and he can only account for it on       the ground that a love of music is inherent in the average       bad boy. He has usually in training a band of twenty pieces:       but he says that this number he could easily augment at any       time to two, three, or even four times as many; for he very       rarely finds a boy that has not a taste for some musical       instrument. The greatest trouble he has yet encountered in       the formation of his bands is the fact, that, as soon as his       pupils become really proficient, they are ready for a       discharge for good conduct, the music possessing such an       influence for good over them as to completely reform       dispositions that would otherwise be incorrigibly bad. Since       he has held the position of music-teacher at the       institution, several boys have been discharged for good and       promising conduct, who have turned their knowledge of music,       acquired within the walls of the industrial school, to       profitable account.\"    We know that music, either vocal or instrumental, and in many cases  the two combined, has for many centuries been considered necessary for  the proper worship of God. The harmony that issues in grand and  melting tones from the noble organ subdues the heart, and fills it  with solemnity, sweetness, and hope: the sacred chant, the prayer or  thanksgiving, uttered in melodious song by the choir or by all the  congregation,--these cause the sordid world with all its cares and  wild passions to be for the while forgotten, and the soul, charged  with the influences of divine harmony and most holy aspiration, is  lifted to heaven. And so music, with its gentle, its ever-winning  power, has constantly been used by the churches to secure the  attendance of those who without it had been indifferent. This has been  especially the practice of the Roman-Catholic Church for inducing the  attendance of Protestants, and is after the custom of olden times,  when the Gentiles were thus drawn into the Christian churches, coming  at first through motives of curiosity. They were, however, often so  captivated by the music as to submit to baptism before departing. In  most of our large cities, a considerable number of wealthy Protestants  are induced, by the superior musical attractions of Catholic churches,  to attend for a while, renting pews, and finally, in some cases, to  become members; and Protestant churches, to sustain the interest in  their services, and to insure the attendance of members and others,  have been obliged to recognize this love among the people for the  divine art.    The German race is remarkable for the intelligence, steadiness, and  industry of its members, and their love for and cultivation of the art  of music,--these latter characteristics prevailing to a most pleasing  degree among all classes of the race. Indeed, it is rare to find a  German not, in some sense at least, a musician. And in what beneficent  uses do they employ the art, especially in their social relations!  Their children are inducted into its charming beauties and helpful  uses from their very earliest years. Of a steady-going, rather  practical life, the Teutonic race yet seeks relief from care, and  finds delightful rest and recreation, in united song, or in some other  form of pleasing harmony; thus wisely uniting the practical with the  poetical in life. How in keeping is a musical love so warm, and a  musical proficiency so general, with a nation which has given to the  world a Mozart, a Haydn, and a Beethoven!    Most persons have remarked the superior affability, the polish of  manners, that distinguishes the people of France. It is also  observable that this nation is much devoted to music; that which is  produced by their own composers, and most in use by the people, being  usually of the graceful, brilliant style. An eminent French writer  states, that, for the possession of these pleasing characteristics,  this nation is indebted to that ancient order of musicians, the  troubadours, whose musical qualities, politeness, and other winning  graces, laid the foundation of the same.    It is said that the ancient Egyptians held music in such high esteem  that they employed it as a remedial agent, believing it a sure cure  for certain kinds of disease. While such a belief--that is, in its  entirety--may not be held in modern times, yet this notion of the  curative qualities of music does not seem so very fanciful or  mysterious after a little reflection. We know that nothing so  generally conduces to recovery from sickness as those influences that  inspire feelings of cheerfulness, and that serve to divert the mind of  the patient from a contemplation of his bodily sufferings,--it being  almost a proverb, that \"a pain forgot is a pain cured,\"--and that one  of the chief of such agencies is the soothing, inspiriting charm of  music. It is not meant by this, of course, that music is of itself and  specifically a cure, but that it may be often employed as a powerful  aid in effecting the same. We know, moreover, that this  delight-affording art may be profitably used to \"minister to a mind  diseased,\" and that its aid is often invoked by those physicians who  are most skilful, if not in curing, at least in ameliorating the  condition of, persons afflicted with that terrible malady, insanity.  Perhaps Saul of olden times, who is said to have been once possessed  with an \"evil spirit,\" was then simply insane; and, taking this view  of his condition,--which is, after all, the one that seems the more  correct,--the statement in the Bible, that David drove away this evil  spirit by his skilful playing upon the harp, becomes easy to  understand, since the occurrence is thus divested of its miraculous  character.    But I must not fail to notice here the remark sometimes made, that the  study and practice of music do not always give to those engaged in the  same the graces of a true refinement; that even persons highly skilled  in the art are sometimes unamiable in manners, and coarse in habits.  To this I reply, that no art nor human agency is capable of elevating  every character to perfection; and that the exceptions above mentioned  become very noticeable, and cause surprise, because of the known good  influence upon the heart and mind generally exerted by the study and  practice of good music. Besides, all great musical \"_stars_\" must not  be classed with the conscientious, loving student of the art. Some  among the former, gifted with phenomenal voices or with rare powers  for instrumental performance, having reached, perhaps, with a few easy  strides, their high positions, and caring but little for music save as  it ministers to their vanity, conceit, or cupidity,--these have missed  that gradually unfolding _culture_ of the mind and heart that belongs  to the progress of one who conscientiously seeks to know music's  manifold beauties, and who with real appreciation for the beautiful in  art, _loving music for music's sake_, feels and exhibits in his  deportment towards his fellow-men its delightful and elevating power.    And here I cannot forbear to remark, that the musical education of the  youth of our country is not being pushed towards that state of  _thoroughness_ so necessary to a real comprehension and enjoyment of  the art. Nearly all intelligent parents are frequent, and even  fulsome, in their praises of music; and, when they speak or write of  it, the laudatory exclamation is often brought into use. And yet they  seem to be satisfied, generally, when their children obtain, by a mere  skimming over its surface, but a peep into the realities and refining  beauties of the science; when the favorite daughter in the use of the  piano-forte, for instance, becomes only the most wearisome of  \"thrummers.\"    \"The London World\" is none too severe on the \"accomplished\" young lady  of the period, when it says,--         \"The ordinary young lady can only play set pieces on the       piano that she has learned at the price of Heaven knows how       many valuable hours' practising. She never remembers any       thing by heart; could not compose two notes to save her       life; and cannot repeat by ear the simplest melody out of an       opera, though she has heard it a hundred times. She is       perfectly ignorant of the history of music; hates classical       works; knows few of the masters' names save Verdi,       Donizetti, Offenbach, and Mozart, the latter only as the       composer of 'Don Giovanni.' Gregorian or Latin chants convey       no especial meaning to her mind: all she can tell you about       them is that they are used in church. As for orchestration,       scoring, and such like, they are only fit matters for       professionals. She will call Wagner horrid, Gounod lovely,  "]]]
