That evening a letter was left at the front door of the old Churchill  place. It was addressed in a scholarly hand to Miss Madeline  Churchill, and Amelia Kent took it in. Amelia had been Miss Madeline's  \"help\" for years and had grown grey in her service. In Amelia's loyal  eyes Miss Madeline was still young and beautiful; she never doubted  that the letter was for her mistress. Nobody else there was ever  addressed as \"Miss Madeline.\"    Miss Madeline was sitting by the window of her own room watching the  sunset through the elms and reading her evening portion of Thomas a  Kempis. She never liked to be disturbed when so employed but she read  her letter after Amelia had gone out.    When she came to a certain paragraph, she turned very pale and Thomas  a Kempis fell to the floor unheeded. When she had finished the letter  she laid it on her lap, clasped her hands, and said, \"Oh, oh, oh,\" in  a faint, tremulous voice. Her cheeks were very pink and her eyes very  bright. She did not even pick up Thomas a Kempis but went to the door  and called Lina.    \"What is it, Auntie?\" asked Lina curiously, noticing the signs of  unusual excitement about Miss Madeline.    Miss Madeline held out her letter with a trembling hand.    \"Lina, dear, this is a letter from the Rev. Cecil Thorne. It--it is--a  proposal of marriage. I feel terribly upset. How very strange that it  should come so soon after our talk this morning! I want you to read  it! Perhaps I ought not to show it to anyone--but I would like you to  see it.\"    Lina took the letter and read it through. It was unmistakably a  proposal of marriage and was, moreover, a very charming epistle of its  kind, albeit a little stiff and old-fashioned.    \"How funny!\" said Lina when she came to the end.    \"Funny!\" exclaimed Miss Madeline, with a trace of indignation in her  gentle voice.    \"Oh, I didn't mean that the letter was funny,\" Lina hastened to  explain, \"only that, as you said, it is odd to think of it coming so  soon after our talk.\"    But this was a little fib on Lina's part. She _had_ thought that the  letter or, rather, the fact that it had been written to Miss Madeline,  funny. The Rev. Cecil Thorne was Miss Madeline's pastor. He was a  handsome, scholarly man of middle age, and Lina had seen a good deal  of him during her summer in Lower Wentworth. She had taught the infant  class in Sunday School and sometimes she had thought that the minister  was in love with her. But she must have been mistaken, she reflected;  it must have been her aunt after all, and the Rev. Cecil Thorne's  shyly displayed interest in her must have been purely professional.    \"What a goose I was to be afraid he was in love with me!\" she thought.  Aloud she said, \"He says he will call tomorrow evening to receive your  answer.\"    \"And, oh, what can I say to him?\" murmured Miss Madeline in dismay.  She wished she had a little of Lina's experience.    \"You are going to--you will accept him, won't you?\" asked Lina  curiously.    \"Oh, my dear, no!\" cried Miss Madeline almost vehemently. \"I couldn't  think of such a thing. I am very sorry; do you think he will feel  badly?\"    \"Judging from his letter I feel sure he will,\" said Lina decidedly.    Miss Madeline sighed. \"Oh, dear me! It is very unpleasant. But of  course I must refuse him. What a beautiful letter he writes too. I  feel very much disturbed by this.\"    Miss Madeline picked up Thomas a Kempis, smoothed him out repentantly,  and placed the letter between his leaves.           *       *       *       *       *    When the Rev. Cecil Thorne called at the old Churchill place next  evening at sunset and asked for Miss Madeline Churchill, Amelia showed  him into the parlour and went to call her mistress. Mr. Thorne sat  down by the window that looked out on the lawn. His heart gave a bound  as he caught a glimpse of an airy white muslin among the trees and a  ripple of distant laughter. The next minute Lina appeared, strolling  down the secluded path that curved about the birches. A young man was  walking beside her with his arm around her. They crossed the green  square before the house and disappeared in the rose garden.    Mr. Thorne leaned back in his chair and put his hand over his eyes. He  felt that he had received his answer, and it was a very bitter moment  for him. He had hardly dared hope that this bright, beautiful child  could care for him, yet the realization came home to him none the less  keenly. When Miss Madeline, paling and flushing by turns, came shyly  in he had recovered his self-control sufficiently to be able to say  \"good evening\" in a calm voice.    Miss Madeline sat down opposite to him. At that moment she was  devoutly thankful that she had never had any other proposal to refuse.  It was a dreadful ordeal. If he would only help her out! But he did  not speak and every moment of silence made it worse.    \"I--received your letter, Mr. Thorne,\" she faltered at last, looking  distressfully down at the floor.    \"My letter!\" Mr. Thorne turned towards her. In her agitation Miss  Madeline did not notice the surprise in his face and tone.    \"Yes,\" she said, gaining a little courage since the ice was broken.  \"It--it--was a very great surprise to me. I never thought you--you  cared for me as--as you said. And I am very sorry because--because I  cannot return your affection. And so, of course, I cannot marry you.\"    Mr. Thorne put his hand over his eyes again. He understood now that  there had been some mistake and that Miss Madeline had received the  letter he had written to her niece. Well, it did not matter--the  appearance of the young man in the garden had settled that. Would he  tell Miss Madeline of her mistake? No, it would only humiliate her and  it made no difference, since she had refused him.    \"I suppose it is of no use to ask you to reconsider your decision?\" he  said.    \"Oh, no,\" cried Miss Madeline almost aghast. She was afraid he might  ask it after all. \"Not in the least use. I am sorry--so very  sorry--but I could not answer differently. We--I hope--this will make  no difference in our friendly relations, Mr. Thorne?\"    \"Not at all,\" said Mr. Thorne gravely. \"We will try to forget that it  has happened.\"    He bowed sadly and went out. Miss Madeline watched him guiltily as he  walked across the lawn. He looked heart-broken. How dreadful it had  been! And Lina had refused twelve men! How could she have lived  through it?    \"Perhaps one gets accustomed to doing it,\" reflected Miss Madeline.  \"But I am sure I never could.\"    \"Did Mr. Thorne feel very badly?\" whispered Lina that night.    \"I'm afraid he did,\" confessed Miss Madeline sorrowfully. \"He looked  so pale and sad, Lina, that my heart ached for him. I am very thankful  that I have never had any other proposals to decline. It is a very  unpleasant experience. But,\" she added, with a little tinge of  satisfaction in her sweet voice, \"I am glad I had one. It--it has made  me feel more like other people, you know, dear.\"          Miss Sally's Company      \"How beautiful!\" said Mary Seymour delightedly, as they dismounted  from their wheels on the crest of the hill. \"Ida, who could have  supposed that such a view would be our reward for climbing that long,  tedious hill with its ruts and stones? Don't you feel repaid?\"    \"Yes, but I am dreadfully thirsty,\" said Ida, who was always practical  and never as enthusiastic over anything as Mary was. Yet she, too,  felt a keen pleasure in the beauty of the scene before them. Almost at  their feet lay the sea, creaming and shimmering in the mellow  sunshine. Beyond, on either hand, stretched rugged brown cliffs and  rocks, here running out to sea in misty purple headlands, there  curving into bays and coves that seemed filled up with sunlight and  glamour and pearly hazes; a beautiful shore and, seemingly, a lonely  one. The only house visible from where the girls stood was a tiny grey  one, with odd, low eaves and big chimneys, that stood down in the  little valley on their right, where the cliffs broke away to let a  brook run out to sea and formed a small cove, on whose sandy shore the  waves lapped and crooned within a stone's throw of the house. On  either side of the cove a headland made out to sea, curving around to  enclose the sparkling water as in a cup.    \"What a picturesque spot!\" said Mary.    \"But what a lonely one!\" protested Ida. \"Why, there isn't another  house in sight. I wonder who lives in it. Anyway, I'm going down to  ask them for a drink of water.\"    \"I'd like to ask for a square meal, too,\" said Mary, laughing. \"I am  discovering that I am hungry. Fine scenery is very satisfying to the  soul, to be sure, but it doesn't still the cravings of the inner girl.  And we've wheeled ten miles this afternoon. I'm getting hungrier every  minute.\"    They reached the little grey house by way of a sloping, grassy lane.  Everything about it was very neat and trim. In front a white-washed  paling shut in the garden which, sheltered as it was by the house, was  ablaze with poppies and hollyhocks and geraniums. A path, bordered by  big white clam shells, led through it to the front door, whose steps  were slabs of smooth red sandstone from the beach.    \"No children here, certainly,\" whispered Ida. \"Every one of those clam  shells is placed just so. And this walk is swept every day. No, we  shall never dare to ask for anything to eat here. They would be afraid  of our scattering crumbs.\"    Ida lifted her hand to knock, but before she could do so, the door was  thrown open and a breathless little lady appeared on the threshold.    She was very small, with an eager, delicately featured face and dark  eyes twinkling behind gold-rimmed glasses. She was dressed  immaculately in an old-fashioned gown of grey silk with a white muslin  fichu crossed over her shoulders, and her silvery hair fell on each  side of her face in long, smooth curls"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#11)"],[1,"e, taking the old field-path across the  valley and up the hill, which he had traversed so often and so  joyfully in boyhood. It was dark now, and a few stars were shining in  the silvery sky. The wind sighed among the pines as he walked under  them. Sometimes he felt that he must turn back--that his pain was  going to master him; then he forced himself to go on.    The old grey house where Sara lived seemed bleak and stricken in the  dull light, with its leafless vines clinging to it. There were no  lights in it. It looked like a home left soulless.    Jeffrey went around to the garden door and knocked. He had expected  the maid to open it, put Sara herself came.    \"Why, Jeff,\" she said, with pleasure in her tones. \"I am so glad to  see you. I have been wondering why you had not come before.\"    \"I did not think you would want to see me yet,\" he said hurriedly. \"I  have thought about you every hour--but I feared to intrude.\"    \"_You_ couldn't intrude,\" she said gently. \"Yes, I have wanted to see  you, Jeff. Come into the library.\"    He followed her into the room where they had always sat in his rare  calls. Sara lighted the lamp on the table. As the light shot up she  stood clearly revealed in it--a tall, slender woman in a trailing gown  of grey. Even a stranger, not knowing her age, would have guessed it  to be what it was, yet it would have been hard to say what gave the  impression of maturity. Her face was quite unlined--a little pale,  perhaps, with more finely cut outlines than those of youth. Her eyes  were clear and bright; her abundant brown hair waved back from her  face in the same curves that Jeffrey had noted in the purple-gowned  child of six, under the pines. Perhaps it was the fine patience and  serenity in her face that told her tale of years. Youth can never  acquire it.    Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried. She came  and took them from him, and her hands touched his, sending a little  thrill of joy through him.    \"How lovely they are! And the first I have seen this spring. You  always bring me the first, don't you, Jeff? Do you remember the first  day we spent picking mayflowers together?\"    Jeff smiled. Could he forget? But something held him back from speech.    Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table, but slipped one starry  pink cluster into the lace on her breast. She came and sat down beside  Jeffrey; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping, and that  there were lines of pain around her lips. Some impulse that would not  be denied made him lean over and take her hand. She left it  unresistingly in his clasp.    \"I am very lonely now, Jeff,\" she said sadly. \"Father has gone. I have  no friends left.\"    \"You have me,\" said Jeffrey quietly.    \"Yes. I shouldn't have said that. You are my friend, I know, Jeff.  But, but--I must leave Pinehurst, you know.\"    \"I learned that tonight for the first time,\" he answered.    \"Did you ever come to a place where _everything_ seemed ended--where  it seemed that there was nothing--simply nothing--left, Jeff?\" she  said wistfully. \"But, no, it couldn't seem so to a man. Only a woman  could fully understand what I mean. That is how I feel now. While I  had Father to live for it wasn't so hard. But now there is nothing.  And I must go away.\"    \"Is there anything I can do?\" muttered Jeffrey miserably. He knew now  that he had made a mistake in coming tonight; he could not help her.  His own pain had unmanned him. Presently he would say something  foolish or selfish in spite of himself.    Sara turned her eyes on him.    \"There is nothing anybody can do, Jeff,\" she said piteously. Her  eyes, those clear child-eyes, filled with tears. \"I shall be  braver--stronger--after a while. But just now I have no strength left.  I feel like a lost, helpless child. Oh, Jeff!\"    She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed. Every sob cut  Jeffrey to the heart.    \"Don't--don't, Sara,\" he said huskily. \"I can't bear to see you suffer  so. I'd die for you if it would do you any good. I love you--I love  you! I never meant to tell you so, but it is the truth. I oughtn't to  tell you now. Don't think that I'm trying to take any advantage of  your loneliness and sorrow. I know--I have always known--that you are  far above me. But that couldn't prevent my loving you--just humbly  loving you, asking nothing else. You may be angry with my presumption,  but I can't help telling you that I love you. That's all. I just want  you to know it.\"    Sara had turned away her head. Jeffrey was overcome with contrition.  Ah, he had no business to speak so--he had spoiled the devotion of  years. Who was he that he should have dared to love her? Silence alone  had justified his love, and now he had lost that justification. She  would despise him. He had forfeited her friendship for ever.    \"Are you angry, Sara?\" he questioned sadly, after a silence.    \"I think I am,\" said Sara. She kept her stately head averted. \"If--if  you have loved me, Jeff, why did you never tell me so before?\"    \"How could I dare?\" he said gravely. \"I knew I could never win  you--that I had no right to dream of you so. Oh, Sara, don't be angry!  My love has been reverent and humble. I have asked nothing. I ask  nothing now but your friendship. Don't take that from me, Sara. Don't  be angry with me.\"    \"I _am_ angry,\" repeated Sara, \"and I think I have a right to be.\"    \"Perhaps so,\" he said simply, \"but not because I have loved you. Such  love as mine ought to anger no woman, Sara. But you have a right to be  angry with me for presuming to put it into words. I should not have  done so--but I could not help it. It rushed to my lips in spite of me.  Forgive me.\"    \"I don't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before,\"  said Sara steadily. \"_That_ is what I have to forgive--not your  speaking at last, even if it was dragged from you against your will.  Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife, Jeff, that you  would not ask me to marry you?\"    \"Sara!\" he said, aghast. \"I--I--you were as far above me as a star in  the sky--I never dreamed--I never hoped----\"    \"That I could care for you?\" said Sara, looking round at last. \"Then  you were more modest than a man ought to be, Jeff. I did not know that  you loved me, or I should have found some way to make you speak out  long ago. I should not have let you waste all these years. I've loved  you--ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill, I think--ever since  I came home from school, I know. I never cared for anyone  else--although I tried to, when I thought you didn't care for me. It  mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some  social difference between us. There, Jeff, you cannot accuse me of not  making my meaning plain.\"    \"Sara,\" he whispered, wondering, bewildered, half-afraid to believe  this unbelievable joy. \"I'm not half worthy of you--but--but\"--he bent  forward and put his arm around her, looking straight into her clear,  unshrinking eyes. \"Sara, will you be my wife?\"    \"Yes.\" She said the word clearly and truly. \"And I will think myself a  proud and happy and honoured woman to be so, Jeff. Oh, I don't shrink  from telling you the truth, you see. You mean too much to me for me to  dissemble it. I've hidden it for eighteen years because I didn't think  you wanted to hear it, but I'll give myself the delight of saying it  frankly now.\"    She lifted her delicate, high-bred face, fearless love shining in  every lineament, to his, and they exchanged their first kiss.          Clorinda's Gifts      \"It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas,\" said  Clorinda, with the mournful sigh of seventeen years.    Aunt Emmy smiled. Aunt Emmy was sixty, and spent the hours she didn't  spend in a bed, on a sofa or in a wheel chair; but Aunt Emmy was never  heard to sigh.    \"I suppose it is worse then than at any other time,\" she admitted.    That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy. She always  sympathized and understood.    \"I'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I'm stony broke,\" said  Clorinda dolefully. \"My spell of fever in the summer and the  consequent doctor's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely. Not  a single Christmas present can I give. And I did so want to give some  little thing to each of my dearest people. But I simply can't afford  it ... that's the hateful, ugly truth.\"    Clorinda sighed again.    \"The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can  give,\" said Aunt Emmy gently, \"nor the best, either.\"    \"Oh, I know it's nicer to give something of your own work,\" agreed  Clorinda, \"but materials for fancy work cost too. That kind of gift is  just as much out of the question for me as any other.\"    \"That was not what I meant,\" said Aunt Emmy.    \"What did you mean, then?\" asked Clorinda, looking puzzled.    Aunt Emmy smiled.    \"Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself,\" she said. \"That would  be better than if I explained it. Besides, I don't think I _could_  explain it. Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in  your thinking out: 'The gift without the giver is bare.'\"    \"I'd put it the other way and say, 'The giver without the gift is  bare,'\" said Clorinda, with a grimace. \"That is my predicament  exactly. Well, I hope by next Christmas I'll not be quite bankrupt.  I'm going into Mr. Callender's store down at Murraybridge in February.  He has offered me the place, you know.\"    \"Won't your aunt miss you terribly?\" said Aunt Emmy gravely.    Clorinda flushed. There was a note in Aunt Emmy's voice that disturbed  her.    \"Oh, yes, I suppose she will,\" she answered hurriedly. \"But she'll get  used to it very soon. And I will be home every Saturday night, you  know. I'm dreadfully tired of being poor, Aunt Emmy, and now that I  have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it. I can  help Aunt Mary, too. I'm to get four dollars a week.\"    \"I think she would"]]]
