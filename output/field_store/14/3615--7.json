The stripes and segments just referred to are not due, as far as is known,  to reversion to characters derived from a cross, but to characters lost by  variation. These cases, however, as Naudin[86] insists in his discussion on  disjunction of character, are closely analogous with those given in the  eleventh chapter, in which crossed plants are known to have produced  half-and-half or striped flowers and fruit, or distinct kinds of flowers on  the same root resembling the two parent-forms. Many piebald animals  probably come under this same head. Such cases, as we shall see in the  chapter on Crossing, apparently result from certain characters not readily  blending together, and, as a consequence of this incapacity for fusion, the  offspring either perfectly resemble one of their two parents, or resemble  one parent in one part and the other parent in another part; or whilst  young are intermediate in character, but with advancing age revert wholly  or by segments to either parent-form, or to both. Thus young trees of the  _Cytisus adami_ are intermediate in foliage and flowers between the two  parent-forms; but when older the buds continually revert either partially  or wholly to both forms. The cases given in the eleventh chapter on the  changes which occurred during growth {38} in crossed plants of Tropaeolum,  Cereus, Datura, and Lathyrus are all analogous. As however these plants are  hybrids of the first generation, and as their buds after a time come to  resemble their parents and not their grandparents, these cases do not at  first appear to come under the law of reversion in the ordinary sense of  the word; nevertheless, as the change is effected through a succession of  bud-generations on the same plant, they may be thus included.    Analogous facts have been observed in the animal kingdom, and are more  remarkable, as they occur strictly in the same individual, and not as with  plants through a succession of bud-generations. With animals the act of  reversion, if it can be so designated, does not pass over a true  generation, but merely over the early stages of growth in the same  individual. For instance, I crossed several white hens with a black cock,  and many of the chickens were during the first year perfectly white, but  acquired during the second year black feathers; on the other hand, some of  the chickens which were at first black became during the second year  piebald with white. A great breeder[87] says, that a Pencilled Brahma hen  which has any of the blood of the Light Brahma in her, will \"occasionally  produce a pullet well pencilled during the first year, but she will most  likely moult brown on the shoulders and become quite unlike her original  colours in the second year.\" The same thing occurs with Light Brahmas if of  impure blood. I have observed exactly similar cases with the crossed  offspring from differently coloured pigeons. But here is a more remarkable  fact: I crossed a turbit, which has a frill formed by the feathers being  reversed on its breast, with a trumpeter; and one of the young pigeons thus  raised showed at first not a trace of the frill, but, after moulting  thrice, a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared on its breast.  According to Girou,[88] calves produced from a red cow by a black bull, or  from a black cow by a red bull, are not rarely born red, and subsequently  become black.    In the foregoing cases, the characters which appear with advancing age are  the result of a cross in the previous or some {39} former generation; but  in the following cases, the characters which thus reappear formerly  appertained to the species, and were lost at a more or less remote epoch.  Thus, according to Azara,[89] the calves of a hornless race of cattle which  originated in Corrientes, though at first quite hornless, as they become  adult sometimes acquire small, crooked, and loose horns; and these in  succeeding years occasionally become attached to the skull. White and black  bantams, both of which generally breed true, sometimes assume as they grow  old a saffron or red plumage. For instance, a first-rate black bantam has  been described, which during three seasons was perfectly black, but then  annually became more and more red; and it deserves notice that this  tendency to change, whenever it occurs in a bantam, \"is almost certain to  prove hereditary.\"[90] The cuckoo or blue-mottled Dorking cock, when old,  is liable to acquire yellow or orange hackles in place of his proper  bluish-grey hackles.[91] Now, as _Gallus bankiva_ is coloured red and  orange, and as Dorking fowls and both kinds of bantams are descended from  this species, we can hardly doubt that the change which occasionally occurs  in the plumage of these birds as their age advances, results from a  tendency in the individual to revert to the primitive type.           *       *       *       *       *    _Crossing as a direct cause of Reversion._--It has long been notorious that  hybrids and mongrels often revert to both or to one of their parent-forms,  after an interval of from two to seven or eight, or according to some  authorities even a greater number of generations. But that the act of  crossing in itself gives an impulse towards reversion, as shown by the  reappearance of long-lost characters, has never, I believe, been hitherto  proved. The proof lies in certain peculiarities, which do not characterise  the immediate parents, and therefore cannot have been derived from them,  frequently appearing in the offspring of two breeds when crossed, which  peculiarities never appear, or appear with extreme rarity, in these same  breeds, as long as they are {40} precluded from crossing. As this  conclusion seems to me highly curious and novel, I will give the evidence  in detail.        My attention was first called to this subject, and I was led to make      numerous experiments, by MM. Boitard and Corbie having stated that,      when they crossed certain breeds, pigeons coloured like the wild _C.      livia_, or the common dovecot, namely, slaty-blue, with double black      wing-bars, sometimes chequered with black, white loins, the tail barred      with black, with the outer feathers edged with white, were almost      invariably produced. The breeds which I crossed, and the remarkable      results attained, have been fully described in the sixth chapter. I      selected pigeons, belonging to true and ancient breeds, which had not a      trace of blue or any of the above specified marks; but when crossed,      and their mongrels recrossed, young birds were continually produced,      more or less plainly coloured slaty-blue, with some or all of the      proper characteristic marks. I may recall to the reader's memory one      case, namely, that of a pigeon, hardly distinguishable from the wild      Shetland species, the grandchild of a red-spot, white fantail, and two      black barbs, from any of which, when purely-bred, the production of a      pigeon coloured like the wild _C. livia_ would have been almost a      prodigy.        I was thus led to make the experiments, recorded in the seventh      chapter, on fowls. I selected long-established, pure breeds, in which      there was not a trace of red, yet in several of the mongrels feathers      of this colour appeared; and one magnificent bird, the offspring of a      black Spanish cock and white Silk hen, was coloured almost exactly like      the wild _Gallus bankiva_. All who know anything of the breeding of      poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure Spanish and of pure      white Silk fowls might have been reared without the appearance of a red      feather. The fact, given on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, of the      frequent appearance, in mongrel fowls, of pencilled or      transversely-barred feathers, like those common to many gallinaceous      birds, is likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character      formerly possessed by some ancient progenitor of the family. I owe to      the kindness of this same excellent observer the inspection of some      neck-hackles and tail-feathers from a hybrid between the common fowl      and a very distinct species, the _Gallus varius_; and these feathers      are transversely striped in a conspicuous manner with dark metallic      blue and grey, a character which could not have been derived from      either immediate parent.        I have been informed by Mr. B. P. Brent, that he crossed a white      Aylesbury drake and a black so-called Labrador duck, both of which are      true breeds, and he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard      (_A. boschas_). Of the musk-duck (_A. moschata_, Linn.) there are two      sub-breeds, namely, white and slate-coloured; and these I am informed      breed true, or nearly true. But the Rev. W. D. Fox tells me that, by      putting a white drake to a slate-coloured duck, black birds, pied with      white, like the wild musk-duck, were always produced.        We have seen in the fourth chapter, that the so-called Himalayan      rabbit, with its snow-white body, black ears, nose, tail, and feet,      breeds {41} perfectly true. This race is known to have been formed by      the union of two varieties of silver-grey rabbits. Now, when a      Himalayan doe was crossed by a sandy-coloured buck, a silver-grey      rabbit was produced; and this is evidently a case of reversion to one      of the parent varieties. The young of the Himalayan rabbit are born      snow-white, and the dark marks do not appear until some time      subsequently; but occasionally young Himalayan rabbits are born of a      light silver-grey, which colour soon disappears; so that here we have a      trace of reversion, during an early period of life, to the      parent-varieties, independently of any recent cross.        In the third chapter is was shown that at "]]]
