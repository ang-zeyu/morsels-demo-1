The general tone of their coloring is quiet, not  to say sombre. There is no striving after brilliant effects. The  Assyrian artist seeks to please by the elegance of his forms and the  harmony of his hues, not to startle by a display of bright and strongly  contrasted colors.[N]\"    [Illustration: 19.--COURT OF HAREM AT KHORSABAD. (RESTORED.) (Perrot and  Chipiez.)]    [Illustration: 20.--CIRCULAR PILLAR-BASE.]    14. It has been asked: how were those halls roofed and how were they  lighted? questions which have given rise to much discussion and which  can scarcely ever be answered in a positive way, since in no single  instance has the upper part of the walls or any part whatever of the  roofing been preserved. Still, the peculiar shape and dimensions of the  principal palace halls goes far towards establishing a sort of  circumstantial evidence in the case. They are invariably long and  narrow, the proportions in some being so striking as to have made them  more like corridors than apartments--a feature, by the by, which must  have greatly impaired their architectural beauty: they were three or  four times as long as they were wide, and even more. The great hall of  the palace of Asshur-nazir-pal on the platform of the Nimrud mound  (excavated by Layard, who calls it, from its position, \"the North-West  palace\") is 160 feet long by not quite 40 wide. Of the five halls in the  Khorsabad palace the largest measures 116 ft. by 33, the smallest 87 by  25, while the most imposing in size of all yet laid open, the great hall  of Sennacherib at Koyunjik, shows a length of fully 180 ft. with a width  of 40. It is scarcely probable that the old builders, who in other  points have shown so much artistic taste, should have selected this  uniform and unsatisfactory shape for their state apartments, unless they  were forcibly held to it by some insuperable imperfection in the means  at their disposal. That they knew how to use proportions more pleasing  in their general effect, we see from the inner open courts, of which  there were several in every palace, and which, in shape and dimensions  are very much like those in our own castles and palaces,--nearly square,  (about 180 ft. or 120 ft. each way) or slightly oblong: 93 ft. by 84,  124 ft. by 90, 150 ft. by 125. Only two courts have been found to lean  towards the long-and-narrow shape, one being 250 ft. by 150, and the  other 220 by 100. But even this is very different from those  passage-like galleries. The only thing which entirely explains this  awkward feature of all the royal halls, is the difficulty of providing  them with a roof. It is impossible to make a flat roof of nothing but  bricks, and although the Assyrians knew how to construct arches, they  used them only for very narrow vaults or over gateways and doors, and  could not have carried out the principle on any very extensive scale.  The only obvious expedient consisted in simply spanning the width of the  hall with wooden beams or rafters. Now no tree, not even the lofty cedar  of Lebanon or the tall cypress of the East, will give a rafter, of equal  thickness from end to end, more than 40 ft. in length, few even that.  There was no getting over or around this necessity, and so the matter  was settled for the artists quite aside from their own wishes. This  also explains the great value which was attached by all the Assyrian  conquerors to fine timber. It was often demanded as tribute, nothing  could be more acceptable as a gift, and expeditions were frequently  undertaken into the distant mountainous regions of the Lebanon on  purpose to cut some. The difficulty about roofing would naturally fall  away in the smaller rooms, used probably as sleeping and dwelling  apartments, and accordingly they vary freely from oblong to square; the  latter being generally about 25 ft. each way, sometimes less, but never  more. There were a great many such chambers in a palace; as many as  sixty-eight have been discovered in Sennacherib's palace at Koyunjik,  and a large portion of the building, be it remembered, is not yet fully  explored. Some were as highly decorated as the great halls, some faced  with plain slabs or plastered, and some had no ornaments at all and  showed the crude brick. These differences probably indicate the  difference of rank in the royal household of the persons to whom the  apartments were assigned.    [Illustration: 21.--INTERIOR VIEW OF ONE OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE HAREM AT  KHORSABAD. (RESTORED.) (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    15. The question of light has been discussed by eminent  explorers--Layard, Botta, Fergusson--at even greater length and with a  greater display of ingenuity than that of roofing. The results of the  learned discussion may be shortly summed up as follows: We may take it  for granted that the halls were sufficiently lighted, for the builders  would not have bestowed on them such lavish artistic labor had they not  meant their work to be seen in all its details and to the best  advantage. This could be effected only in one of three ways, or in two  combined: either by means of numerous small windows pierced at regular  intervals above the frieze of enamelled bricks, between that and the  roof,--or by means of one large opening in the roof of woodwork, as  proposed by Layard in his own restoration, or by smaller openings placed  at more frequent intervals. This latter contrivance is in general use  now in Armenian houses, and Botta, who calls it a _louvre_, gives a  drawing of it.[O] It is very ingenious, and would have the advantage of  not admitting too great a mass of sunlight and heat, and of being easily  covered with carpets or thick felt rugs to exclude the rain. The second  method, though much the grandest in point of effect, would present none  of these advantages and would be objectionable chiefly on account of the  rain, which, pouring down in torrents--as it does, for weeks at a time,  in those countries--must very soon damage the flooring where it is of  brick, and eventually convert it into mud, not to speak of the  inconvenience of making the state apartments unfit for use for an  indefinite period. The small side windows just below the roof would  scarcely give sufficient light by themselves. Who knows but they may  have been combined with the _louvre_ system, and thus something very  satisfactory finally obtained.    [Illustration: 22.--COLORED FRIEZE IN ENAMELLED TILES.]    [Illustration: 23.--COLORED FRIEZE IN ENAMELLED TILES.]    16. The kings of Chaldea, Babylonia and Assyria seem to have been  absolutely possessed with a mania for building. Scarcely one of them but  left inscriptions telling how he raised this or that palace, this or  that temple in one or other city, often in many cities. Few contented  themselves with repairing the buildings left by their predecessors. This  is easy to be ascertained, for they always mention all they did in that  line. Vanity, which seems to have been, together with the love of booty,  almost their ruling passion, of course accounts for this in a great  measure. But there are also other causes, of which the principal one was  the very perishable nature of the constructions, all their heavy  massiveness notwithstanding. Being made of comparatively soft and  yielding material, their very weight would cause the mounds to settle  and bulge out at the sides in some places, producing crevices in others,  and of course disturbing the balance of the thick but loose masonry of  the walls constructed on top of them. These accidents could not be  guarded against by the outer casing of stone or burnt brick, or even by  the strong buttresses which were used from a very early period to prop  up the unwieldy piles: the pressure from within was too great to be  resisted.    [Illustration: 24.--PAVEMENT SLAB.]    17. An outer agent, too, was at work, surely and steadily destructive:  the long, heavy winter rains. Crude brick, when exposed to moisture,  easily dissolves into its original element--mud; even burned brick is  not proof against very long exposure to violent wettings; and we know  that the mounds were half composed of loose rubbish. Once thoroughly  permeated with moisture, nothing could keep these huge masses from  dissolution. The builders were well aware of the danger and struggled  against it to the best of their ability by a very artfully contrived and  admirably executed system of drainage, carried through the mounds in all  directions and pouring the accumulated waters into the plain out of  mouths beautifully constructed in the shape of arched vaults.[P] Under  the flooring of most of the halls have been found drains, running along  the centre, then bending off towards a conduit in one of the corners,  which carried the contents down into one of the principal channels.    [Illustration: 25.--SECTION OF ORNAMENTAL DOORWAY (ENAMELLED BRICK OR  TILES). KHORSABAD. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    18. But all these precautions were, in the long run, of little avail, so  that it was frequently a simpler and less expensive proceeding for a  king to build a new palace, than to keep repairing and propping up an  old one which crumbled to pieces, so to speak, under the workmen's  hands. It is not astonishing that sometimes, when they had to give up an  old mansion as hopeless, they proceeded to demolish it, in order to  carry away the stone and use it in structures of their own, probably not  so much as a matter of thrift, as with a view to quickening the work,  stone-cutting in the quarries and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#11)"],[1,"fact is that each of these  (and other falls which could be named) has its own particular charm,  and the last one visited always seems to be the best. A great deal  also depends on the time of year, and on the amount of snow which has  fallen on the mountains during the preceding winter. For, it must be  remembered, it is the rapid melting of the snow in the spring that  gives to most of the Norwegian waterfalls such a volume of water in  the early months of the year.    But the summer rainfall on the high fjelds is always heavy, and  even after all the snow of the year has melted, an immense amount  of water has to drain away to the lowlands, and so to the sea. At  first it collects in the tarns which fill the hollows of the mountain  plateaux, but these, overflowing, soon send their surplus water by  certain channels away over the cliffs.    The greater waterfalls, however, are those which indirectly carry off  the water from the snowfields, the mountains capped with perpetual  snow; for, except during the frost-bound months of winter, these  falls are always full.    The snowfields are of themselves of immense interest, but so intimately  are they connected with the glaciers that we shall speak of the two  together. A snowfield may exist without a glacier, but a glacier  cannot exist without a snowfield--that is to say, the glacier is made  by the snowfield.    How snowfields came into existence nobody knows for certain, but it  is generally supposed by learned people who have studied the matter  that, thousands of years ago, after what is called the Great Ice Age,  Norway gradually put off her mantle of ice and snow and became what  she is now; but the snow on the higher parts of the land has never  yet had time to melt right away, because fresh snow is always falling  and adding to the pile. And it is the weight of all this fresh snow on  the top of the accumulation of centuries which produces the glaciers.    The Folgefond, in the Hardanger district, is the snowfield which most  people who visit Norway see sooner or later, and since it covers  an area of 120 square miles, at a height of about 5,500 feet above  the sea, it is visible from a great many points of view. It forms a  background to many a picture of the varied scenery of the Hardanger  Fjord, and it has the advantage of being easily accessible.    Of course, the belief in the old popular legends is dying out even in  Norway, but there are still some aged grandfathers and grandmothers  living near the great snowfield who can tell the tales as they were  told to them. Thus they relate that where the Folgefond now lies was  once a fertile and well-peopled valley, called Folgedalen, and that in  one night its farms, forests, people, and cattle were buried in snow as  a judgment for some great sin. One story ascribes the misfortune to the  curse of a gipsy woman, who had been refused alms by the priest; while  another relates that the valley was overwhelmed because the inhabitants  had murdered their liege lord, the petty King of the district.    But why it happened and how it happened does not really much matter,  for there the vast field of snow is to-day, and there it will doubtless  remain for many centuries to come. As has been said, you can go up  to the top of it and sleigh across a portion of its summit, or you  can potter round about it and examine its many glaciers.    The two largest glaciers of the Folgefond are the Buar Brae, near  Odda, and the Bondhus Brae, near Sundal, and to spend a day at either  of them is a real treat. But it is not wise to visit these glaciers  without someone who knows them, for one might easily fall into one  of the great fissures in the ice, known as crevasses, especially if  lately-fallen snow had hidden the opening of the mighty crack.    A glacier, as most people know (now that everyone goes to Switzerland,  if not to Norway), is nothing more than a river of ice; not a nice,  clean, smooth sheet of ice, but a rough mass of frozen billows,  almost blue in colour, and generally covered with sand, dust, and  stones of all sizes. Wherever, beneath the edge of a snowfield,  the country shapes itself into a valley, there you will find a glacier.    If you make a snowball, and keep pressing and kneading it in your  hands, you will soon convert it into a solid lump of ice. That is  just what the sun does to the snowfield. It keeps melting the new  snow, and this presses down into the old snow, so that the weight  of the whole thing squeezes out the frozen snow into the valleys in  the form of glaciers. And, as this process goes on year after year,  the glacier would naturally keep going lower and lower down into the  valley were it not for the fact that the point (or snout, as it is  termed) of the glacier very frequently breaks off, and disappears into  the torrent of ice-water which flows away from it. So some glaciers,  although always moving, never grow any longer, but others creep a  little bit farther down each year.    There are many other interesting things about a glacier. One of them  is the moraine, which consists of heaps of rocks and stones broken off  from the edges of the valley by the great river of ice as it pushes  its way imperceptibly forward. These rocks are embedded in the ice  or borne on its surface, and are only given up when the extremity  of the glacier melts away into the torrent. Some of the rocks thus  transported are of immense weight, and the torrent is powerless to  move them; year by year, therefore, the jumbled heap of boulders and  rocks is added to until it often grows to an enormous size.    Another fine snowfield in the Hardanger district is the Joekul,  a splendid white dome, whose melting snows help to swell the  Voeringfos. The Joekul does not possess many large glaciers, but one  of them has, in past years, been a great source of trouble to the  people who live near it. This is the Rembesdal glacier, at the far  end of the Simodal Valley, near Eidfjord.    The Simodal is a beautiful and fertile valley, with farms on either  bank of the river, which rushes through it to the fjord. This river  comes from the glacier, but not directly. The head of the valley is  choked by a high cliff, over which tumbles a grand waterfall, and  this issues from a large mountain lake, into the opposite end of which  descends the snout of the glacier, with a continuous stream of milky  water flowing from it. So far there is nothing peculiar in all this,  but the peculiarity lies higher up.    Some little distance up the glacier, and almost at right angles to one  side of it, is a rocky hollow or small valley, and into this the water  begins to pour in the spring as soon as the sun is strong enough to  begin to melt the snow. The great glacier blocks up the end of this  hollow with a thick dam of ice, and before long a huge lake is formed.    What used to happen every two or three years was that the pressure of  the water in this dammed-up lake became so tremendous that the glacier  at last could resist it no longer. Away went the side and lower part  of the glacier, and with one mighty crash the water escaped. Down  into the lower lake, and over the waterfall, the wall of solid water,  several feet in height, descended into the valley. There it carried  destruction far and wide, sweeping away crops, cattle, farm buildings,  bridges, and everything that came in its way. The loss of life also  was often considerable, for there was no warning other than the roar  of the water as it burst into the valley.    A few years ago, however, some Norwegian engineers devised a means of  averting these terrible floods by enabling the upper lake to empty  itself gradually. They constructed under the glacier an iron-lined  tunnel, connecting the upper lake with the lower, and in this way the  water escaped at once. So the people of Simodal can now sleep in peace.            CHAPTER XIII    DRIVING IN NORWAY      Like Switzerland, Norway has splendid roads. No difficulty in  road-making seems to be too great for the Norwegian engineers to  overcome. One frequently sees miles of road cut out of the solid  rock of some mountain-side, and skirting the edge of a fjord or  long lake. Again, a road may wind its way through a narrow gorge,  with precipices a thousand feet high on either hand, and down in the  depths a wild torrent, crossed every here and there by massive stone  bridges; or, over the open mountains a road will zigzag upwards to  a pass in long loops, like the famous \"Snake Road\" near Roeldal.    And the surface of all these roads is hard and kept in good repair--at  any rate, in the summer months. In the winter they are, of course,  thick in snow, which, when beaten down by the sleigh traffic, forms  a new surface, which takes the wear and tear off the actual roadway  for several months.    But we are now writing of the summer, after the snow has all melted,  the snow-ploughs put on one side, and the roads recovered from the  havoc wrought by the streams of melting snow. Then the sleighs have  been hidden away in the innermost recesses of barns and outhouses,  and the driving season begins.    Driving is one of the greatest enjoyments of Norwegian travel, though  too much of it is perhaps wearisome. The best plan is to arrange a  tour, so that some of it shall be by railway, some by steamer, some  walking, and some driving, and this is generally easy to manage. The  particular charm of driving is that the traveller can take his own  time, go his own pace, and stop when and where he chooses. In this  manner the scenery is capable of being more fully appreciated.    Until quite recently there were very few railways in Norway, and there  are not many now. There are, however, plenty of excellent roads,  and a well-organized system of posting. The posting-stations are  situated about ten miles apart, and consist usually of a small inn  or farmhouse, where the traveller can demand food and lodgings,"]]]
