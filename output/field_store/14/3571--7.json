CHAPTER VII      The last two exorcisms had been so much talked about in the town, that  Grandier, although he had not been present, knew everything that had  happened, down to the smallest detail, so he once more laid a complaint  before the bailiff, in which he represented that the nuns maliciously  continued to name him during the exorcisms as the author of their  pretended possession, being evidently influenced thereto by his enemies,  whereas in fact not only had he had no communication with them, but had  never set eyes on them; that in order to prove that they acted under  influence it was absolutely necessary that they should be sequestered,  it being most unjust that Mignon and Barre, his mortal enemies, should  have constant access to them and be able to stay with them night and  day, their doing so making the collusion evident and undeniable; that  the honour of God was involved, and also that of the petitioner, who had  some right to be respected, seeing that he was first in rank among the  ecclesiastics of the town.    Taking all this into consideration, he consequently prayed the bailiff  to be pleased to order that the nuns buffering from the so-called  possession should at once be separated from each other and from their  present associates, and placed under the control of clerics assisted by  physicians in whose impartiality the petitioner could have confidence;  and he further prayed that all this should be performed in spite of any  opposition or appeal whatsoever (but without prejudice to the right of  appeal), because of the importance of the matter. And in case the  bailiff were not pleased to order the sequestration, the petitioner  would enter a protest and complaint against his refusal as a withholding  of justice.    The bailiff wrote at the bottom of the petition that it would be at once  complied with.    After Urbain Grandier had departed, the physicians who had been present  at the exorcisms presented themselves before the bailiff, bringing their  report with them. In this report they said that they had recognised  convulsive movements of the mother superior's body, but that one visit  was not sufficient to enable them to make a thorough diagnosis, as the  movements above mentioned might arise as well from a natural as from  supernatural causes; they therefore desired to be afforded opportunity  for a thorough examination before being called on to pronounce an  opinion. To this end they required permission to spend several days and  nights uninterruptedly in the same room with the patients, and to treat  them in the presence of other nuns and some of the magistrates. Further,  they required that all the food and medicine should pass through the  doctors' hands, and that no one, should touch the patients except quite  openly, or speak to them except in an audible voice. Under these  conditions they would undertake to find out the true cause of the  convulsions and to make a report of the same.    It being now nine o'clock in the morning, the hour when the exorcisms  began, the bailiff went over at once to the convent, and found Barre  half way through the mass, and the superior in convulsions. The  magistrate entered the church at the moment of the elevation of the  Host, and noticed among the kneeling Catholics a young man called  Dessentier standing up with his hat on. He ordered him either to uncover  or to go away. At this the convulsive movements of the superior became  more violent, and she cried out that there were Huguenots in the church,  which gave the demon great power over her. Barre asked her how many  there were present, and she replied, \"Two,\" thus proving that the devil  was no stronger in arithmetic than in Latin; for besides Dessentier,  Councillor Abraham Gauthier, one of his brothers, four of his sisters,  Rene Fourneau, a deputy, and an attorney called Angevin, all of the  Reformed faith, were present.    As Barre saw that those present were greatly struck, by this numerical  inaccuracy, he tried to turn their thoughts in another direction by  asking the superior if it were true that she knew no Latin. On her  replying that she did not know a single word, he held the pyx before her  and ordered her to swear by the holy sacrament. She resisted at first,  saying loud enough for those around her to hear--    \"My father, you make me take such solemn oaths that I fear God will  punish me.\"    To this Barre replied--    \"My daughter, you must swear for the glory of God.\"    And she took the oath.    Just then one of the bystanders remarked that the mother superior was in  the habit of interpreting the Catechism to her scholars. This she  denied, but acknowledged that she used to translate the Paternoster and  the Creed for them. As the superior felt herself becoming somewhat  confused at this long series of embarrassing questions, she decided on  going into convulsions again, but with only moderate success, for the  bailiff insisted that the exorcists should ask her where Grandier was at  that very moment. Now, as the ritual teaches that one of the proofs of  possession is the faculty of telling, when asked, where people are,  without seeing them, and as the question was propounded in the  prescribed terms, she was bound to answer, so she said that Grandier was  in the great hall of the castle.    \"That is not correct,\" said the bailiff, \"for before coming here I  pointed out a house to Grandier and asked him to stay in it till I came  back. If anybody will go there, they will be sure to find him, for he  wished to help me to discover the truth without my being obliged to  resort to sequestration, which is a difficult measure to take with  regard to nuns.\"    Barre was now ordered to send some of the monks present to the castle,  accompanied by a magistrate and a clerk. Barre chose the Carmelite  prior, and the bailiff Charles Chauvet, assessor of the bailiwick,  Ismael Boulieau a priest, and Pierre Thibaut, an articled clerk, who all  set out at once to execute their commission, while the rest of those  present were to await their return.    Meanwhile the superior, who had not spoken a word since the bailiff's  declaration, remained, in spite of repeated exorcisms, dumb, so Barre  sent for Sister Claire, saying that one devil would encourage the other.  The bailiff entered a formal protest against this step, insisting that  the only result of a double exorcism would be to cause confusion, during  which suggestions might be conveyed to the superior, and that the proper  thing to do was, before beginning new conjurations, to await the return  of the messengers. Although the bailiff's suggestion was most  reasonable, Barre knew better than to adopt it, for he felt that no  matter what it cost he must either get rid of the bailiff and all the  other officials who shared his doubts, or find means with the help of  Sister Claire to delude them into belief. The lay sister was therefore  brought in, in spite of the opposition of the bailiff and the other  magistrates, and as they did not wish to seem to countenance a fraud,  they all withdrew, declaring that they could no longer look on at such a  disgusting comedy. In the courtyard they met their messengers returning,  who told them they had gone first to the castle and had searched the  great hall and all the other rooms without seeing anything of Grandier;  they had then gone to the house mentioned by the bailiff, where they  found him for whom they were looking, in the company of Pere Veret, the  confessor of the nuns, Mathurin Rousseau, and Nicolas Benoit, canons,  and Conte, a doctor, from whom they learned that Grandier had not been  an instant out of their sight for the last two hours. This being all the  magistrates wanted to know, they went home, while their envoys went  upstairs and told their story, which produced the effect which might be  expected. Thereupon a Carmelite brother wishing to weaken the  impression, and thinking that the devil might be more lucky in his,  second guess than the first, asked the superior where Grandier was just  then. She answered without the slightest hesitation that he was walking  with the bailiff in the church of Sainte-Croix. A new deputation was at  once sent off, which finding the church empty, went on to the palace,  and saw the bailiff presiding at a court. He had gone direct from the  convent to the palace, and had not yet seen Grandier. The same day the  nuns sent word that they would not consent to any more exorcisms being  performed in the presence of the bailiff and the officials who usually  accompanied him, and that for the future they were determined to answer  no questions before such witnesses.    Grandier learning of this piece of insolence, which prevented the only  man on whose impartiality he could reckon from being henceforward  present at the exorcisms, once more handed in a petition to the bailiff,  begging for the sequestration of the two nuns, no matter at what risk.  The bailiff, however, in the interests of the petitioner himself, did  not dare to grant this request, for he was afraid that the  ecclesiastical authorities would nullify his procedure, on the ground  that the convent was not under his jurisdiction.    He, however, summoned a meeting of the principal inhabitants of the  town, in order to consult with them as to the best course to take for  the public good. The conclusion they arrived at was to write to the  attorney-general and to the Bishop of Poitiers, enclosing copies of the  reports which had been drawn up, and imploring them to use their  authority to put an end to these pernicious intrigues. This was done,  but the attorney-general replied that the matter being entirely  ecclesiastical the Parliament was not competent to take cognisance of  it. As for the bishop, he sent no answer at all.    He was not, however, so silent towards Grandier's enemies; for the  ill-success of the exorcisms of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#11)"],[1,"out in the evening, inhaling the scent  of the flowers, and listening to the murmur of the water, or the sound  of the whispering breeze in the leaves. Then, coming back from these  sweet recollections to reality, she shed tears, and called on her  husband and son. So deep was her reverie that she did not hear the room  door open, did not perceive that darkness had come on. The light of a  candle, dispersing the shadows, made her start; she turned her head, and  saw Derues coming towards her. He smiled, and she made an effort to keep  back the tears which were shining in her eyes, and to appear calm.    \"I am afraid I disturb you,\" he said. \"I came to ask a favour, madame.\"    \"What is it, Monsieur Derues?\" she inquired.    \"Will you allow me to have a large chest brought into this room? I ought  to pack some valuable things in it which are in my charge, and are now  in this cupboard. I am afraid it will be in your way.\"    \"Is it not your own house, and is it not rather I who am in the way and  a cause of trouble? Pray have it brought in, and try to forget that I am  here. You are most kind to me, but I wish I could spare you all this  trouble and that I were fit to go back to Buisson. I had a letter from  my husband yesterday----\"    \"We will talk about that presently, if you wish it,\" said Derues. \"I  will go and fetch the servant to help me to carry in this chest. I have  put it off hitherto, but it really must be sent in three days.\"    He went away, and returned in a few minutes. The chest was carried in,  and placed before the cupboard at the foot of the bed. Alas! the poor  lady little thought it was her own coffin which stood before her!    The maid withdrew, and Derues assisted Madame de Lamotte to a seat near  the fire, which he revived with more fuel. He sat down opposite to her,  and by the feeble light of the candle placed on a small table between  them could contemplate at leisure the ravages wrought by poison on her  wasted features.    \"I saw your son to-day,\" he said: \"he complains that you neglect him,  and have not seen him for twelve days. He does not know you have been  ill, nor did I tell him. The dear boy! he loves you so tenderly.\"    \"And I also long to see him. My friend, I cannot tell you what terrible  presentiments beset me; it seems as if I were threatened with some great  misfortune; and just now, when you came in, I could think only of death.  What is the cause of this languor and weakness? It is surely no  temporary ailment. Tell me the truth: am I not dreadfully altered? and  do you not think my husband will be shocked when he sees me like this?\"    \"You are unnecessarily anxious,\" replied Derues; \"it is rather a failing  of yours. Did I not see you last year tormenting yourself about  Edouard's health, when he was not even thinking of being ill? I am not  so soon alarmed. My own old profession, and that of chemistry, which I  studied in my youth, have given me some acquaintance with medicine. I  have frequently been consulted, and have prescribed for patients whose  condition was supposed to be desperate, and I can assure you I have  never seen a better and stronger constitution than yours. Try to calm  yourself, and do not call up chimeras; because a mind at ease is the  greatest enemy of illness. This depression will pass, and then you will  regain your strength.\"    \"May God grant it! for I feel weaker every day.\"    \"We have still some business to transact together. The notary at  Beauvais writes that the difficulties which prevented his paying over  the inheritance of my wife's relation, Monsieur Duplessis, have mostly  disappeared. I have a hundred thousand livres at my disposal,--that is  to say, at yours,--and in a month at latest I shall be able to pay off  my debt. You ask me to be sincere,\" he continued, with a tinge of  reproachful irony; \"be sincere in your turn, madame, and acknowledge  that you and your husband have both felt uneasy, and that the delays I  have been obliged to ask for have not seemed very encouraging to you?\"    \"It is true,\" she replied; \"but we never questioned your good faith.\"    \"And you were right. One is not always able to carry out one's  intentions; events can always upset our calculations; but what really is  in our power is the desire to do right--to be honest; and I can say that  I never intentionally wronged anyone. And now. I am happy in being able  to fulfil my promises to you. I trust when I am the owner of  Buisson-Souef you will not feel obliged to leave it.\"    \"Thank you; I should like to come occasionally, for all my happy  recollections are connected with it. Is it necessary for me to accompany  you to Beauvais?\"    \"Why should you not? The change would do you good.\"    She looked up at him and smiled sadly. \"I am not in a fit state to  undertake it.\"    \"Not if you imagine that you are unable, certainly. Come, have you any  confidence in me?\"    \"The most complete confidence, as you know.\"    \"Very well, then: trust to my care. This very evening I will prepare a  draught for you to take to-morrow morning, and I will even now fix the  duration of this terrible malady which frightens you so much. In two  days I shall fetch Edouard from his school to celebrate the beginning of  your convalescence, and we will start, at latest, on February 1st. You  are astonished at what I say, but you shall see if I am not a good  doctor, and much cleverer than many who pass for such merely because the  have obtained a diploma.\"    \"Then, doctor, I will place myself in your hands.\"    \"Remember what I say. You will leave this on February 1st.\"    \"To begin this cure, can you ensure my sleeping to-night?\"    \"Certainly. I will go now, and send my wife to you. She will bring a  draught, which you must promise to take.\"    \"I will exactly follow your prescriptions. Goodnight, my friend.\"    \"Good-night, madame; and take courage\"; and bowing low, he left the  room.    The rest of the evening was spent in preparing the fatal medicine. The  next morning, an hour or two after Madame de Lamotte had swallowed it,  the maid who had given it to her came and told Derues the invalid was  sleeping very heavily and snoring, and asked if she ought to be awoke.  He went into the room, and, opening the curtains, approached the bed. He  listened for some time, and recognised that the supposed snoring was  really he death-rattle. He sent the servant off into the country with a  letter to one of his friends, telling her not to return until the Monday  following, February 3rd. He also sent away his wife, on some unknown  pretext, and remained alone with his victim.    So terrible a situation ought to have troubled the mind of the most  hardened criminal. A man familiar with murder and accustomed to shed  blood might have felt his heart sink, and, in the absence of pity, might  have experienced disgust at the sight of this prolonged and useless  torture; but Derues, calm and easy, as if unconscious of evil, sat  coolly beside the bed, as any doctor might have done. From time to time  he felt the slackening pulse, and looked at the glassy and sightless  eyes which turned in their orbits, and he saw without terror the  approach of night, which rendered this awful 'tete-a-tete' even more  horrible. The most profound silence reigned in the house, the street was  deserted, and the only sound heard was caused by an icy rain mixed with  snow driven against the glass, and occasionally the howl of the wind,  which penetrated the chimney and scattered the ashes. A single candle  placed behind the curtains lighted this dismal scene, and the irregular  flicker of its flame cast weird reflections and dancing shadows an the  walls of the alcove. There came a lull in the wind, the rain ceased, and  during this instant of calm someone knocked, at first gently, and then  sharply, at the outer door. Derues dropped the dying woman's hand and  bent forward to listen. The knock was repeated, and he grew pale. He  threw the sheet, as if it were a shroud, over his victim's head drew the  curtains of the alcove, and went to the door. \"Who is there?\" he  inquired.    \"Open, Monsieur Derues,\" said a voice which he recognised as that of a  woman of Chartres whose affairs he managed, and who had entrusted him  with sundry deeds in order that he might receive the money due to her.  This woman had begun to entertain doubts as to Derues' honesty, and as  she was leaving Paris the next day, had resolved to get the papers out  of his hands.    \"Open the door,\" she repeated. \"Don't you know my voice?\"    \"I am sorry I cannot let you in. My servant is out: she has taken the  key and locked the door outside.\"    \"You must let me in,\" the woman continued; \"it is absolutely necessary I  should speak to you.\"    \"Come to-morrow.\"    \"I leave Paris to-morrow, and I must have those papers to-night.\"    He again refused, but she spoke firmly and decidedly. \"I must come in.  The porter said you were all out, but, from the rue des Menetriers I  could see the light in your room. My brother is with me, and I left him  below. I shall call him if you don't open the door.\"    \"Come in, then,\" said Derues; \"your papers are in the sitting-room. Wait  here, and I will fetch them.\" The woman looked at him and took his hand.  \"Heavens! how pale you are! What is the matter?\"    \"Nothing is the matter: will you wait here? \"But she would not release  his arm, and followed him into the sitting-room, where Derues began to  seek hurriedly among the various papers which covered a table. \"Here  they are,\" he said; \"now you can go.\"    \"Really,\" said the woman, examining her deeds carefully, \"never yet did  I see you in such a hurry to give up things which don't belong to you.  But do hold that candle steadily; your hand is shaking so that I cannot  see to read.\"    At that moment the silence which prevailed all round was broken by a cry  of anguish, a long groan proceeding from the chamber to the right of the"]]]
