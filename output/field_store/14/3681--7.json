And those which the first Time  at like Incidences are equally refracted, are again at like Incidences  equally and uniformly refracted, and that whether they be refracted  before they be separated from one another, as in the fifth Experiment,  or whether they be refracted apart, as in the twelfth, thirteenth and  fourteenth Experiments. The Refraction therefore of every Ray apart is  regular, and what Rule that Refraction observes we are now to shew.[E]    The late Writers in Opticks teach, that the Sines of Incidence are in a  given Proportion to the Sines of Refraction, as was explained in the  fifth Axiom, and some by Instruments fitted for measuring of  Refractions, or otherwise experimentally examining this Proportion, do  acquaint us that they have found it accurate. But whilst they, not  understanding the different Refrangibility of several Rays, conceived  them all to be refracted according to one and the same Proportion, 'tis  to be presumed that they adapted their Measures only to the middle of  the refracted Light; so that from their Measures we may conclude only  that the Rays which have a mean Degree of Refrangibility, that is, those  which when separated from the rest appear green, are refracted according  to a given Proportion of their Sines. And therefore we are now to shew,  that the like given Proportions obtain in all the rest. That it should  be so is very reasonable, Nature being ever conformable to her self; but  an experimental Proof is desired. And such a Proof will be had, if we  can shew that the Sines of Refraction of Rays differently refrangible  are one to another in a given Proportion when their Sines of Incidence  are equal. For, if the Sines of Refraction of all the Rays are in given  Proportions to the Sine of Refractions of a Ray which has a mean Degree  of Refrangibility, and this Sine is in a given Proportion to the equal  Sines of Incidence, those other Sines of Refraction will also be in  given Proportions to the equal Sines of Incidence. Now, when the Sines  of Incidence are equal, it will appear by the following Experiment, that  the Sines of Refraction are in a given Proportion to one another.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]    _Exper._ 15. The Sun shining into a dark Chamber through a little round  Hole in the Window-shut, let S [in _Fig._ 26.] represent his round white  Image painted on the opposite Wall by his direct Light, PT his oblong  coloured Image made by refracting that Light with a Prism placed at the  Window; and _pt_, or _2p 2t_, _3p 3t_, his oblong colour'd Image made by  refracting again the same Light sideways with a second Prism placed  immediately after the first in a cross Position to it, as was explained  in the fifth Experiment; that is to say, _pt_ when the Refraction of the  second Prism is small, _2p 2t_ when its Refraction is greater, and _3p  3t_ when it is greatest. For such will be the diversity of the  Refractions, if the refracting Angle of the second Prism be of various  Magnitudes; suppose of fifteen or twenty Degrees to make the Image _pt_,  of thirty or forty to make the Image _2p 2t_, and of sixty to make the  Image _3p 3t_. But for want of solid Glass Prisms with Angles of  convenient Bignesses, there may be Vessels made of polished Plates of  Glass cemented together in the form of Prisms and filled with Water.  These things being thus ordered, I observed that all the solar Images or  coloured Spectrums PT, _pt_, _2p 2t_, _3p 3t_ did very nearly converge  to the place S on which the direct Light of the Sun fell and painted his  white round Image when the Prisms were taken away. The Axis of the  Spectrum PT, that is the Line drawn through the middle of it parallel to  its rectilinear Sides, did when produced pass exactly through the middle  of that white round Image S. And when the Refraction of the second Prism  was equal to the Refraction of the first, the refracting Angles of them  both being about 60 Degrees, the Axis of the Spectrum _3p 3t_ made by  that Refraction, did when produced pass also through the middle of the  same white round Image S. But when the Refraction of the second Prism  was less than that of the first, the produced Axes of the Spectrums _tp_  or _2t 2p_ made by that Refraction did cut the produced Axis of the  Spectrum TP in the points _m_ and _n_, a little beyond the Center of  that white round Image S. Whence the proportion of the Line 3_t_T to the  Line 3_p_P was a little greater than the Proportion of 2_t_T or 2_p_P,  and this Proportion a little greater than that of _t_T to _p_P. Now when  the Light of the Spectrum PT falls perpendicularly upon the Wall, those  Lines 3_t_T, 3_p_P, and 2_t_T, and 2_p_P, and _t_T, _p_P, are the  Tangents of the Refractions, and therefore by this Experiment the  Proportions of the Tangents of the Refractions are obtained, from whence  the Proportions of the Sines being derived, they come out equal, so far  as by viewing the Spectrums, and using some mathematical Reasoning I  could estimate. For I did not make an accurate Computation. So then the  Proposition holds true in every Ray apart, so far as appears by  Experiment. And that it is accurately true, may be demonstrated upon  this Supposition. _That Bodies refract Light by acting upon its Rays in  Lines perpendicular to their Surfaces._ But in order to this  Demonstration, I must distinguish the Motion of every Ray into two  Motions, the one perpendicular to the refracting Surface, the other  parallel to it, and concerning the perpendicular Motion lay down the  following Proposition.    If any Motion or moving thing whatsoever be incident with any Velocity  on any broad and thin space terminated on both sides by two parallel  Planes, and in its Passage through that space be urged perpendicularly  towards the farther Plane by any force which at given distances from the  Plane is of given Quantities; the perpendicular velocity of that Motion  or Thing, at its emerging out of that space, shall be always equal to  the square Root of the sum of the square of the perpendicular velocity  of that Motion or Thing at its Incidence on that space; and of the  square of the perpendicular velocity which that Motion or Thing would  have at its Emergence, if at its Incidence its perpendicular velocity  was infinitely little.    And the same Proposition holds true of any Motion or Thing  perpendicularly retarded in its passage through that space, if instead  of the sum of the two Squares you take their difference. The  Demonstration Mathematicians will easily find out, and therefore I shall  not trouble the Reader with it.    Suppose now that a Ray coming most obliquely in the Line MC [in _Fig._  1.] be refracted at C by the Plane RS into the Line CN, and if it be  required to find the Line CE, into which any other Ray AC shall be  refracted; let MC, AD, be the Sines of Incidence of the two Rays, and  NG, EF, their Sines of Refraction, and let the equal Motions of the  incident Rays be represented by the equal Lines MC and AC, and the  Motion MC being considered as parallel to the refracting Plane, let the  other Motion AC be distinguished into two Motions AD and DC, one of  which AD is parallel, and the other DC perpendicular to the refracting  Surface. In like manner, let the Motions of the emerging Rays be  distinguish'd into two, whereof the perpendicular ones are MC/NG x CG  and AD/EF x CF. And if the force of the refracting Plane begins to act  upon the Rays either in that Plane or at a certain distance from it on  the one side, and ends at a certain distance from it on the other side,  and in all places between those two limits acts upon the Rays in Lines  perpendicular to that refracting Plane, and the Actions upon the Rays at  equal distances from the refracting Plane be equal, and at unequal ones  either equal or unequal according to any rate whatever; that Motion of  the Ray which is parallel to the refracting Plane, will suffer no  Alteration by that Force; and that Motion which is perpendicular to it  will be altered according to the rule of the foregoing Proposition. If  therefore for the perpendicular velocity of the emerging Ray CN you  write MC/NG x CG as above, then the perpendicular velocity of any other  emerging Ray CE which was AD/EF x CF, will be equal to the square Root  of CD_q_ + (_MCq/NGq_ x CG_q_). And by squaring these Equals, and adding  to them the Equals AD_q_ and MC_q_ - CD_q_, and dividing the Sums by the  Equals CF_q_ + EF_q_ and CG_q_ + NG_q_, you will have _MCq/NGq_ equal to  _ADq/EFq_. Whence AD, the Sine of Incidence, is to EF the Sine of  Refraction, as MC to NG, that is, in a given _ratio_. And this  Demonstration being general, without determining what Light is, or by  what kind of Force it is refracted, or assuming any thing farther than  that the refracting Body acts upon the Rays in Lines perpendicular to  its Surface; I take it to be a very convincing Argument of the full  truth of this Proposition.    So then, if the _ratio_ of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of any  sort of Rays be found in any one case, 'tis given in all cases; and this  may be readily found by the Method in the following Proposition.      _PROP._ VII. THEOR. VI.    _The Perfection of Telescopes is impeded by the different Refrangibility  of the Rays of Light._    The Imperfection of Telescopes is vulgarly attributed to the spherical  Figures of the Glasses, and therefore Mathematicians have propounded to  figure them by the conical Sections. To shew that they are mistaken, I  have inserted this Proposition; the truth of which will appear by the  measure of the Refractions of the several sorts of Rays; and these  measures I thus determine.    In the third Experiment of this first Part, where the refracting Angle  of the Prism was 62-1/2 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#11)"],[1,"the tail should  prevent confusion with the blue whale. At a distance, however, sei  whales are difficult to distinguish from either fin whales or Bryde's  whales. The primary clues for distinguishing them from fins are the  differences in swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics tabularized  in detail on p. 26 and the asymmetrical coloration of the fin whale.    Sei whales may be distinguished from Bryde's whales only upon close  examination. The dorsal fin of Bryde's whales is small, to 18 inches  (45.7 cm), sharply pointed, and often worn on the rear margin. If close  examination is possible, the sei whale will be seen to have only a  single head ridge. Bryde's whales have two additional ridges--one on  each side of the main ridge. Bryde's whales are primarily fish feeders  and their diving behavior more closely resembles that of a fin whale  than that of a sei whale. (See p. 37).      Distribution    The distribution and migrations of the sei whale during most of the year  are rather poorly known. The species is known to avoid the colder  regions near the pack ice and to range from Iceland south to the  northeast Venezuelan coast and the northeast and southwest Gulf of  Mexico. There are also records from Cuba and the Virgin Islands. Along  the northeast United States and eastern Canadian coasts, where most  research on sei whales has been conducted, the species migrates from New  England through the Blanford, Nova Scotia area in June and July, is  found in small numbers off eastern Newfoundland in August and September  (abundant in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland in August), and continues  northward to the Davis Straits in September and October. An offshore  stock may be found year-round in the Labrador Sea. The summer range (May  to September or October) extends from New England to southern Arctic  waters. Though some individuals remain behind through November, the  southward movement of the bulk of the population presumably begins in  October. In general, sei whales do not venture as far north as fin  whales but may have a greater tendency to enter tropical waters.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded sei whales are most likely to be confused with fin whales or  Bryde's whales. The three head ridges of the Bryde's whale (sei whales  have only one) assist in distinguishing sei whales from Bryde's whales.  They may be distinguished from fin whales and all other rorquals by the  following characteristics: 1) The color of the baleen plates--uniformly  ash black with a blue tinge and fine white bristles (Table 2). 2) The  density of bristles on the plates--sei whales have from 35 to 60 baleen  fringes per centimeter; all other rorquals have far fewer (less than  35). 3) The relative lengths of the ventral grooves--the grooves of sei  whales end well before the navel; those of blue, fin, and Bryde's whales  extend at least to the navel. 4) The relatively small numbers of ventral  grooves (38-56)--both blue and fin whales have more; Bryde's whales have  approximately the same number.    If the animal is not in an advanced state of decomposition, the region  of white coloration of the belly may also be visible.    [Illustration: Figure 24.--The head of a sei whale is intermediate in  shape between that of the blue whale and that of the fin whale. When  viewed from the side it is slightly arched. Note the single central head  ridge, from just in front of the blowholes to near the tip of the snout.  Bryde's whales, with which sei whales are most likely to be confused in  the tropical and subtropical portions of their range, have two auxiliary  ridges, one on each side of the top of the head, in addition to this  main central ridge.

In all  three, note the tall, distinctly falcate dorsal fin (which has been  described as sickle or scimitar in shape) positioned farther forward on  the back than the fins of either the fin whale or the blue whale. In the  photo in the middle, note that the dorsal fin has appeared on the  surface while the blowholes are still open. Sei whales, generally  skimmer feeders and rather shallow divers, often show the dorsal fin and  much of the back for relatively long periods as they surface to breathe.

Description    Bryde's whales reach a maximum length of approximately 46 feet (14 m).  They closely resemble sei whales in external appearance. At a distance,  the head of this species is similar in profile and general appearance to  that of the sei whale. The most distinctive field characteristic of the  species, however, is the presence of three ridges along the head  anterior to the blowhole. In addition to the medial ridge characteristic  of all the other balaenopterid species, Bryde's whales have two  secondary ridges on the top of the head--one along each side even with  the blowhole running forward towards the tip of the snout. If they can  be examined at close range, Bryde's whales can be positively identified  by this character alone.    The dorsal fin of Bryde's whales is up to 18 inches (45.7 cm) tall,  extremely falcate, pointed on the tip, located well more than one-third  forward from the tail, and is often irregularly notched or frayed on the  rear margin from unknown causes. Bryde's whales are dark gray overall,  though some individuals, like some minke whales, have a small region of  gray on each side just forward of the dorsal fin.      Natural History Notes    Bryde's whales, like minke whales, reportedly often approach close to  vessels as if curious about them. During this time they may be examined  carefully and their identifying characteristics seen.    Though euphausiids may be an important food for this species in limited  areas, Bryde's whales often feed on schooling fish (including pilchards,  anchovies, herring, and mackerel). This food preference is reflected in  the diving behavior of the species. Bryde's whales are not \"skimmer\"  feeders; they are deeper divers. When they surface to breathe, they  often rise more steeply to the surface, exposing much of the head, roll  the body sharply, and hump up the tail stock before beginning another  dive. In this species, as in the fin whale, it can be generally stated  that the amount of the back which is exposed above the surface as the  animal sounds is approximately twice the height of the dorsal fin. They  apparently do not raise the tail flukes when beginning a dive.      May Be Confused With    At sea Bryde's whales may be confused with sei whales, fin whales, and  perhaps minke whales.    They may be most readily distinguished from sei whales by the  characteristics discussed on p. 32 and by differences in diving  behavior. The shallow-feeding sei whales surface and blow at regular  intervals over long periods of time. Bryde's whales are deeper divers,  less likely to surface, and blow at evenly spaced intervals. If they are  seen only briefly or at a distance, however, the two species may be  impossible to differentiate.    During the winter months, when fin whales may venture into tropical  waters, they may also be confused with Bryde's whales. But fin whales  seldom exhibit curiosity about boats. In addition, the dorsal fin of the  fin whale is larger, is located farther back on the back than that of  Bryde's whale, and does not become visible as soon after the blow. It is  also less likely to be worn on the rear margin than that of a Bryde's  whale.    The head of the fin whale is more acutely pointed. Furthermore, the  right lower lip and the right front baleen of the fin whale are white.  The baleen and the right lower lip of Bryde's whales are dark gray. If  the animals can be approached closely from the right side, positive  identification is possible using these differences in color.    Like Bryde's whales, minke whales often approach close to vessels. But  minke whales have an acutely pointed snout, a single head ridge, and a  white band"]]]
