Another very strong feature of pan-Islam is the consistency of the creed  from which it grows. I do not necessarily imply that Islam itself is  benefited thereby, for consistency sometimes means narrowness, and we  are not considering creeds; but there is no doubt about the dynamic  force of a movement based on a religion which is sure of itself. A  Moslem has one authorised version of the Koran, and only one; his simple  creed is contained in its first chapter and is as short as the Lord's  Prayer, which it somewhat resembles in style. Praising God as the Lord  of the worlds (not only of this world of ours), it attributes to Him  mercy and clemency with supreme power over the Day of Judgment and is an  avowal of worship and service. Its only petition is to be led in the way  of the righteous, avoiding errors that incur His wrath. Contrast this  with the many confusing aspects of Christianity. Perhaps diverse  opinions tend to purify and invigorate a creed, but they certainly do  not strengthen the cohesion of any secular movement based on it.    Then, again, the Moslem conception of God and the hereafter stiffens the  backbone of pan-Islam in adversity. They are taught to believe that He is  _really_ omnipotent and that His actions are beyond criticism--welfare  and affliction being alike acceptable as His will. We, on the other hand,  seem to be developing the theory of a finite God warring against, and  occasionally overcome by, evil, which includes (in this new thesis) human  suffering and sorrow as well as sin. There is a growing idea, pioneered  partly by Mr. H. G. Wells and apparently supported by many of the clergy,  that the acts of God must square with human ideals of mercy or justice,  and as many occurrences do not, the inference is that evil gets the best  of it sometimes. Now the Moslem slogan is \"Allah Akbar\" (God is Greatest),  and that seems to me a better battle-cry than, for example, \"Gott mit  uns,\" as God will still be great and invincible to Moslems in their  victory or defeat; but the finite idea presumes, in disaster, that you  and your God have been defeated together. It is not my business to  criticise either conception from a religious point of view, but in  mundane affairs it is the former that will make for fighting force,  especially as we still insist that our God is a jealous God, visiting the  sins of the fathers, etc.: surely this is not a human ideal of justice;  the obvious deduction is that our modern Deity is stronger to punish than  protect--hardly an encouraging attribute.    Whether a religion is the better for an organised priesthood or not is  irrelevant to our subject, but the absence of it in Islam certainly  strengthens the pan-Islamic movement, as each Moslem may consider  himself a standard-bearer of his faith, while we are apt to leave too  much to our priests, thus engendering slackness on our part and  meticulous dogma on theirs; both undermine Christian brotherhood. The  fact that priestly stipends seem to the ordinary layman as in inverse  ratio to the duties performed also widens the breach between clergy and  laity, besides sapping clerical _moral_. This is not the particular  feature of any one sect--the reader can supply cases within his own  experience, but here is one that is probably outside it and showing how  widespread the system is. The rank and file of the Greek Orthodox clergy  are notoriously ill-paid. Yet their monastery at Jerusalem costs  LE.15,000 per annum to maintain and pays LE.40,000 annually in clerical  salaries to archbishops and clergy who control the spiritual affairs of  less than fifteen thousand people. It derives LE.30,000 from its  property in Russia, LE.25,000 from the property of the Holy Sepulchre,  and as much again from visitors and other sources; and this in a region  where the Founder of our faith was content to wander with less certainty  of shelter than the wild creatures of the countryside.    Incidentally, the monastery seems to have been unable to curtail its  expenditure during the War, for it has accumulated debts to the amount  of LE.600,000, most of its sources of income having ceased for the time.  I quote from current newspapers. Blame does not necessarily attach to  the monastery or its administrators, who may have done their best to  fulfill their obligations under adverse circumstances; I would merely  draw attention to the incongruity of the whole system as regards a  universal brotherhood based on Christian teaching. There are no such  exotic growths to impede the march of pan-Islam.    So much for the strength of the pan-Islamic movement. Now let us  consider its weak points.    To begin with, the gross abuse of pan-Islam by interested parties for  non-spiritual ends during the War has done the genuine movement harm.  That lying, political appeal to _jihad_ has made thinking Moslems  mistrust the infallibility of organised pan-Islam, of which the  culminating expression is Holy War, one of the most sacred Mussulman  duties if justly invoked. We Christians do not make such mistakes. When  Italy was fighting the Turks in Tripoli the Pope himself warned  Christian soldiers against regarding the campaign as a Crusade, and when  we took Jerusalem we took it side by side with our Mussulman allies and  forthwith placed an orthodox Moslem guard on Omar's mosque. In this  connection it may be of interest to note that the officer commanding a  mixed Christian guard at the Holy Sepulchre was a Jew.    Another source of weakness, so far as a united Moslem world is  concerned, may be found in the antagonistic points of view between  civilised and uncivilised Moslems (I use the attribute in its modern  sense). Uncivilised Moslems view with suspicion and, in fact, derision  the dress and customs of their civilised co-religionists, insisting that  European coats and trousers display the figure indecently and that their  Frankish luxuries and amusements are snares of Eblis. The enlightened  Moslem, on the other hand, regards the tribesman as a _jungliwala_, or  wild man of the woods, derides his illiteracy, and is revolted by the  harsh severity of the old Islamic penal code as practised still in  semi-barbaric Moslem States. Now we Christians are fairly lenient as  regards each other's customs, and still more so with regard to dress  (judging by the garb we tolerate), while we have quite outgrown our old  playful habits of boiling, burning, or torturing our fellow-men except  on the battle-fields of civilised warfare.    Civilisation (as we understand it) is a two-edged weapon and tool  smiting or serving pan-Islam and Christendom, but on the whole it serves  the latter rather than the former, as the superior resources of  Christendom can take fuller advantage of it as a tool or a weapon,  though both turn to scourges when used against each other in battle.  Also its handmaid, Education, though in itself a foe to no religion,  _does_ tend to tone down dogma and engender tolerance, thus minimising  the dynamic force of bigotry in pan-Islam, though consolidating the real  stability of religion on its own base. Moreover, some gifts of  civilisation can do a lot of harm if wrongly used; I refer more  especially to drink, drugs, and dress. Just as hereditary exposure to  the infection of certain diseases is said to confer, by survival of the  fittest, a certain immunity therefrom--for example, consumption among us  Europeans and typhoid among Asiatics--so moral ills seem to affect  humanity to a greater or less extent in inverse proportion to the  temptation in that particular respect which the individual and his  forebears have successfully resisted. The average European and his  ancestors have been accustomed to drink fermented liquor for many  centuries, and in moderation as judged by the standard of his time, but  he has always been taught to avoid opium and has not known the drug for  long. The oriental Moslem, on the other hand, has used opium as a remedy  and prophylactic against malaria for generations, but is strictly  ordered by his creed to consider the consumption, production, gift or  sale of alcohol a deadly sin. In consequence, the European can usually  take alcohol in moderation, but almost invariably slips into a pit of  his own digging when he tries to do the same with opium, while the  oriental Moslem can use opium in moderation (provided that he confines  himself to swallowing it and does not smoke it), but when he drinks,  usually drinks to excess because he has not learned to do otherwise. It  is a melancholy fact that hitherto in countries opened up by our Western  civilisation drink has got in long before education, unless  extraordinary precautions have been taken to prevent it; that is one  reason why Moslem States are so wary of civilised encroachment. As for  drugs other than opium (and far more dangerous), civilised Moslems,  especially in Egypt, are alarmed at the spread of hashish-smoking among  their co-religionists, while the cultured classes, including women-folk,  are taking to cocaine: the material for both vices is supplied from  European sources, mostly Greek. Dress, compared with the other two  demons, is merely a fantastic though mischievous sprite and can be quite  attractive, but it breaks up many a Moslem home when carried to excess  in the harem, as it frequently is in civilised circles, while the  younger men vie with each other in the more flagrant extravagances of  occidental garb: prayers and ablutions do not harmonise with  well-creased trousers and stylish boots any more than a veil does with a  divided skirt. The native Press is always attacking the above abuses,  but they are firmly rooted. All three undermine the pan-Islamic  structure by causing cleavage in public opinion.

James laughed at this; but there was a thickness in his voice when he  said, \"You have been my best friend except my mother; I hope you won't  forget me.\"    \"No, lad, no!\" said John, \"and if ever I can do you a good turn I hope  you won't forget me.\"    The next day Joe came to the stables to learn all he could before James  left. He learned to sweep the stable, to bring in the straw and hay; he  began to clean the harness, and helped to wash the carriage. As he was  quite too short to do anything in the way of grooming Ginger and me,  James taught him upon Merrylegs, for he was to have full charge of  him, under John. He was a nice little bright fellow, and always came  whistling to his work.    Merrylegs was a good deal put out at being \"mauled about,\" as he said,  \"by a boy who knew nothing;\" but toward the end of the second week he  told me confidentially that he thought the boy would turn out well.    At last the day came when James had to leave us; cheerful as he always  was, he looked quite down-hearted that morning.    \"You see,\" he said to John, \"I am leaving a great deal behind; my mother  and Betsy, and you, and a good master and mistress, and then the horses,  and my old Merrylegs. At the new place there will not be a soul that I  shall know. If it were not that I shall get a higher place, and be able  to help my mother better, I don't think I should have made up my mind to  it; it is a real pinch, John.\"    \"Ay, James, lad, so it is; but I should not think much of you if you  could leave your home for the first time and not feel it. Cheer up,  you'll make friends there; and if you get on well, as I am sure you  will, it will be a fine thing for your mother, and she will be proud  enough that you have got into such a good place as that.\"    So John cheered him up, but every one was sorry to lose James; as for  Merrylegs, he pined after him for several days, and went quite off his  appetite. So John took him out several mornings with a leading rein,  when he exercised me, and, trotting and galloping by my side, got up the  little fellow's spirits again, and he was soon all right.    Joe's father would often come in and give a little help, as he  understood the work; and Joe took a great deal of pains to learn, and  John was quite encouraged about him.          18 Going for the Doctor      One night, a few days after James had left, I had eaten my hay and was  lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly roused by the  stable bell ringing very loud. I heard the door of John's house open,  and his feet running up to the hall. He was back again in no time; he  unlocked the stable door, and came in, calling out, \"Wake up, Beauty!  You must go well now, if ever you did;\" and almost before I could think  he had got the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head. He just  ran round for his coat, and then took me at a quick trot up to the hall  door. The squire stood there, with a lamp in his hand.    \"Now, John,\" he said, \"ride for your life--that is, for your mistress'  life; there is not a moment to lose. Give this note to Dr. White; give  your horse a rest at the inn, and be back as soon as you can.\"    John said, \"Yes, sir,\" and was on my back in a minute. The gardener who  lived at the lodge had heard the bell ring, and was ready with the gate  open, and away we went through the park, and through the village, and  down the hill till we came to the toll-gate. John called very loud and  thumped upon the door; the man was soon out and flung open the gate.    \"Now,\" said John, \"do you keep the gate open for the doctor; here's the  money,\" and off he went again.    There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John  said to me, \"Now, Beauty, do your best,\" and so I did; I wanted no whip  nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to  the ground; I don't believe that my old grandfather, who won the race  at Newmarket, could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge John  pulled me up a little and patted my neck. \"Well done, Beauty! good old  fellow,\" he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up,  and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty, the moon was  bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through  a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles' run we  came to the town, through the streets and into the market-place. It was  all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones--everybody  was asleep. The church clock struck three as we drew up at Dr. White's  door. John rang the bell twice, and then knocked at the door like  thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his  head out and said, \"What do you want?\"    \"Mrs. Gordon is very ill, sir; master wants you to go at once; he thinks  she will die if you cannot get there. Here is a note.\"    \"Wait,\" he said, \"I will come.\"    He shut the window, and was soon at the door.    \"The worst of it is,\" he said, \"that my horse has been out all day and  is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the  other. What is to be done? Can I have your horse?\"    \"He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him  a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it, if you think  fit, sir.\"    \"All right,\" he said; \"I will soon be ready.\"    John stood by me and stroked my neck; I was very hot. The doctor came  out with his riding-whip.    \"You need not take that, sir,\" said John; \"Black Beauty will go till he  drops. Take care of him, sir, if you can; I should not like any harm to  come to him.\"    \"No, no, John,\" said the doctor, \"I hope not,\" and in a minute we had  left John far behind.    I will not tell about our way back. The doctor was a heavier man than  John, and not so good a rider; however, I did my very best. The man at  the toll-gate had it open. When we came to the hill the doctor drew me  up. \"Now, my good fellow,\" he said, \"take some breath.\" I was glad he  did, for I was nearly spent, but that breathing helped me on, and soon  we were in the park. Joe was at the lodge gate; my master was at the  hall door, for he had heard us coming. He spoke not a word; the doctor  went into the house with him, and Joe led me to the stable. I was glad  to get home; my legs shook under me, and I could only stand and pant. I  had not a dry hair on my body, the water ran down my legs, and I steamed  all over, Joe used to say, like a pot on the fire. Poor Joe! he was  young and small, and as yet he knew very little, and his father, who  would have helped him, had been sent to the next village; but I am sure  he did the very best he knew. He rubbed my legs and my chest, but he did  not put my warm cloth on me; he thought I was so hot I should not like  it. Then he gave me a pailful of water to drink; it was cold and very  good, and I drank it all; then he gave me some hay and some corn, and  thinking he had done right, he went away. Soon I began to shake and  tremble, and turned deadly cold; my legs ached, my loins ached, and my  chest ached, and I felt sore all over. Oh! how I wished for my warm,  thick cloth, as I stood and trembled. I wished for John, but he had  eight miles to walk, so I lay down in my straw and tried to go to sleep.  After a long while I heard John at the door; I gave a low moan, for I  was in great pain. He was at my side in a moment, stooping down by me. I  could not tell him how I felt, but he seemed to know it all; he covered  me up with two or three warm cloths, and then ran to the house for some  hot water; he made me some warm gruel, which I drank, and then I think I  went to sleep.    John seemed to be very much put out. I heard him say to himself over and  over again, \"Stupid boy! stupid boy! no cloth put on, and I dare say the  water was cold, too; boys are no good;\" but Joe was a good boy, after  all.    I was now very ill; a strong inflammation had attacked my lungs, and I  could not draw my breath without pain. John nursed me night and day; he  would get up two or three times in the night to come to me. My master,  too, often came to see me. \"My poor Beauty,\" he said one day, \"my good  horse, you saved your mistress' life, Beauty; yes, you saved her life.\"  I was very glad to hear that, for it seems the doctor had said if we had  been a little longer it would have been too late. John told my master he  never saw a horse go so fast in his life. It seemed as if the horse knew  what was the matter. Of course I did, though John thought not; at least  I knew as much as this--that John and I must go at the top of our speed,  and that it was for the sake of the mistress.          19 Only Ignorance      I do not know how long I was ill. Mr. Bond, the horse-doctor, came every  day. One day he bled me; John held a pail for the blood. I felt very  faint after it and thought I should die, and I believe they all thought  so too.    Ginger and Merrylegs had been moved into the other stable, so that I  might be quiet, for the fever made me very quick of hearing; any little  noise seemed quite loud, and I could tell every one's footstep going to  and from the house. I knew all that was going on. One night John had to  give me a draught; Thomas Green came in to help him. After I had taken  it and John had made me as comfortable as he could, he said he should  stay half an hour to see how the medicine settled. Thomas said he  would stay with him, so they went and sat down on a bench that had been  brought into Merrylegs' stall, and put down the lantern at their feet,  that I might not be disturbed with the light.    For awhile both men sat silent, and"]]]
