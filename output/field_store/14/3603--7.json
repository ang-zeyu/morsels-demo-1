The young man lost  himself completely.    \"The fault is mine,\" said he. \"Thou art kind and worthy. I thank thee  from my whole soul. Permit me only to put one more question: Why didst  thou not have Lygia sent directly to my house?\"    \"Because Caesar wishes to preserve appearances. People in Rome will talk  about this,--that we removed Lygia as a hostage. While they are talking,  she will remain in Caesar's palace. Afterward she will be removed quietly  to thy house, and that will be the end. Bronzebeard is a cowardly  cur. He knows that his power is unlimited, and still he tries to give  specious appearances to every act. Hast thou recovered to the degree of  being able to philosophize a little? More than once have I thought, Why  does crime, even when as powerful as Caesar, and assured of being beyond  punishment, strive always for the appearances of truth, justice, and  virtue? Why does it take the trouble? I consider that to murder a  brother, a mother, a wife, is a thing worthy of some petty Asiatic king,  not a Roman Caesar; but if that position were mine, I should not write  justifying letters to the Senate. But Nero writes. Nero is looking for  appearances, for Nero is a coward. But Tiberius was not a coward;  still he justified every step he took. Why is this? What a marvellous,  involuntary homage paid to virtue by evil! And knowest thou what strikes  me? This, that it is done because transgression is ugly and virtue  is beautiful. Therefore a man of genuine aesthetic feeling is also a  virtuous man. Hence I am virtuous. To-day I must pour out a little  wine to the shades of Protagoras, Prodicus, and Gorgias. It seems that  sophists too can be of service. Listen, for I am speaking yet. I took  Lygia from Aulus to give her to thee. Well. But Lysippus would have made  wonderful groups of her and thee. Ye are both beautiful; therefore my  act is beautiful, and being beautiful it cannot be bad. Marcus, here  sitting before thee is virtue incarnate in Caius Petronius! If Aristides  were living, it would be his duty to come to me and offer a hundred minae  for a short treatise on virtue.\"    But Vinicius, as a man more concerned with reality than with treatises  on virtue, replied,--\"To-morrow I shall see Lygia, and then have her in  my house daily, always, and till death.\"    \"Thou wilt have Lygia, and I shall have Aulus on my head. He will summon  the vengeance of all the infernal gods against me. And if the beast  would take at least a preliminary lesson in good declamation! He will  blame me, however, as my former doorkeeper blamed my clients but him I  sent to prison in the country.\"    \"Aulus has been at my house. I promised to give him news of Lygia.\"    \"Write to him that the will of the 'divine' Caesar is the highest law,  and that thy first son will bear the name Aulus. It is necessary that  the old man should have some consolation. I am ready to pray Bronzebeard  to invite him to-morrow to the feast. Let him see thee in the triclinium  next to Lygia.\"    \"Do not do that. I am sorry for them, especially for Pomponia.\"    And he sat down to write that letter which took from the old general the  remnant of his hope.          Chapter VII      ONCE the highest heads in Rome inclined before Acte, the former favorite  of Nero. But even at that period she showed no desire to interfere in  public questions, and if on any occasion she used her influence over  the young ruler, it was only to implore mercy for some one. Quiet and  unassuming, she won the gratitude of many, and made no one her enemy.  Even Octavia was unable to hate her. To those who envied her she seemed  exceedingly harmless. It was known that she continued to love Nero with  a sad and pained love, which lived not in hope, but only in memories of  the time in which that Nero was not only younger and loving, but better.  It was known that she could not tear her thoughts and soul from those  memories, but expected nothing; since there was no real fear that Nero  would return to her, she was looked upon as a person wholly inoffensive,  and hence was left in peace. Poppaea considered her merely as a quiet  servant, so harmless that she did not even try to drive her from the  palace.    But since Caesar had loved her once and dropped her without offence in a  quiet and to some extent friendly manner, a certain respect was retained  for her. Nero, when he had freed her, let her live in the palace, and  gave her special apartments with a few servants. And as in their time  Pallas and Narcissus, though freedmen of Claudius, not only sat  at feasts with Claudius, but also held places of honor as powerful  ministers, so she too was invited at times to Caesar's table. This was  done perhaps because her beautiful form was a real ornament to a  feast. Caesar for that matter had long since ceased to count with any  appearances in his choice of company. At his table the most varied  medley of people of every position and calling found places. Among them  were senators, but mainly those who were content to be jesters as well.  There were patricians, old and young, eager for luxury, excess, and  enjoyment. There were women with great names, who did not hesitate to  put on a yellow wig of an evening and seek adventures on dark streets  for amusement's sake. There were also high officials, and priests who  at full goblets were willing to jeer at their own gods. At the side of  these was a rabble of every sort: singers, mimes, musicians, dancers of  both sexes; poets who, while declaiming, were thinking of the  sesterces which might fall to them for praise of Caesar's verses; hungry  philosophers following the dishes with eager eyes; finally, noted  charioteers, tricksters, miracle-wrights, tale-tellers, jesters, and the  most varied adventurers brought through fashion or folly to a few days'  notoriety. Among these were not lacking even men who covered with long  hair their ears pierced in sign of slavery.    The most noted sat directly at the tables; the lesser served to amuse  in time of eating, and waited for the moment in which the servants would  permit them to rush at the remnants of food and drink. Guests of this  sort were furnished by Tigellinus, Vatinius, and Vitelius; for these  guests they were forced more than once to find clothing befitting the  chambers of Caesar, who, however, liked their society, through feeling  most free in it. The luxury of the court gilded everything, and  covered all things with glitter. High and low, the descendants of great  families, and the needy from the pavements of the city, great artists,  and vile scrapings of talent, thronged to the palace to sate their  dazzled eyes with a splendor almost surpassing human estimate, and to  approach the giver of every favor, wealth, and property,--whose single  glance might abase, it is true, but might also exalt beyond measure.    That day Lygia too had to take part in such a feast. Fear, uncertainty,  and a dazed feeling, not to be wondered at after the sudden change, were  struggling in her with a wish to resist. She feared Nero; she feared the  people and the palace whose uproar deprived her of presence of mind;  she feared the feasts of whose shamelessness she had heard from Aulus,  Pomponia Graecina, and their friends. Though young, she was not without  knowledge, for knowledge of evil in those times reached even children's  ears early. She knew, therefore, that ruin was threatening her in the  palace. Pomponia, moreover, had warned her of this at the moment of  parting. But having a youthful spirit, unacquainted with corruption, and  confessing a lofty faith, implanted in her by her foster mother, she  had promised to defend herself against that ruin; she had promised  her mother, herself and also that Divine Teacher in whom she not only  believed, but whom she had come to love with her half-childlike heart  for the sweetness of his doctrine, the bitterness of his death, and the  glory of his resurrection.    She was confident too that now neither Aulus nor Pomponia would be  answerable for her actions; she was thinking therefore whether it would  not be better to resist and not go to the feast. On the one hand fear  and alarm spoke audibly in her soul; on the other the wish rose in her  to show courage in suffering, in exposure to torture and death. The  Divine Teacher had commanded to act thus. He had given the example  himself. Pomponia had told her that the most earnest among the adherents  desire with all their souls such a test, and pray for it. And Lygia,  when still in the house of Aulus, had been mastered at moments by a  similar desire. She had seen herself as a martyr, with wounds on her  feet and hands, white as snow, beautiful with a beauty not of earth, and  borne by equally white angels into the azure sky; and her imagination  admired such a vision. There was in it much childish brooding, but  there was in it also something of delight in herself, which Pomponia had  reprimanded. But now, when opposition to Caesar's will might draw after  it some terrible punishment, and the martyrdom scene of imagination  become a reality, there was added to the beautiful visions and to the  delight a kind of curiosity mingled with dread, as to how they would  punish her, and what kind of torments they would provide. And her soul,  half childish yet, was hesitating on two sides. But Acte, hearing of  these hesitations, looked at her with astonishment as if the maiden  were talking in a fever. To oppose Caesar's will, expose oneself from the  first moment to his anger? To act thus one would need to be a child that  knows not what it says. From Lygia's own words it appears that she is,  properly speaking, not really a hostage, but a maiden forgotten by her  own people. No law of nations protects her; and even if it did, Caesar  is powerful enough to trample on it in a moment of anger. It has pleased  Caesar to take her, and he will dispose of her."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#11)"],[1,"   The prophets of Israel recognized clearly, that the starry host of  heaven and the angelic host were distinct; that the first, in their  brightness, order, and obedience formed fitting comparison for the  second; but that both were created beings; neither were divinities.    The heathen nations around recognized also the hosts both of the stars  and of spiritual beings, but the first they took as the manifestations  of the second, whom they counted as divinities. There was often a great  confusion between the two, and the observance or worship of the first  could not be kept distinguished from the recognition or worship of the  other; the very ideogram for a god was an 8-rayed star.    The Hebrews were warned again and again lest, confusing in their minds  these two great hosts of stars and angels, they should deem the one the  divine manifestation of the other, the divinity, not accounting them  both fellow-servants, the handiwork of God.    Thus, in the wilderness, the Lord commands them through Moses--         \"Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves, . . . lest thou       lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun,       and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven,       shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the       Lord thy God hath divided [distributed] unto all nations under       the whole heaven.\"    But the one celestial army continually suggests the other, and the two  are placed in the closest parallelism when reference is made to the time  when the foundations of the earth were fastened, and the corner stone  thereof was laid,         \"When the morning stars sang together,        And all the sons of God shouted for joy.\"    So when Deborah sings of the deliverance which the Lord gave to Israel  at the battle of the Kishon, she puts the stars for the angelic legions  that she feels assured were engaged in warring in their support.                     \"They fought from heaven;       The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.\"    The \"courses\" of the stars are the paths which they appear to follow as  they move round the pole of the heavens as the night proceeds, whilst  the stars themselves stand for the heavenly helpers who, unseen, had  mingled in the battle and discomforted the squadrons of Sisera's  war-chariots. It almost reads as if to Deborah had been vouchsafed such  a vision as Elisha prayed might be given to his servant:--         \"Therefore sent the King of Syria thither horses, and       chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and       compassed the city about.         \"And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and       gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with       horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my       master! how shall we do?         \"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more       than they that be with them.         \"And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray Thee, open his       eyes that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the       young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of       horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.\"    The solemn procession of the starry host through the long night--the  rising in the east, the southing, and the setting in the west--is not  the only ordered movement of the stars of heaven that may be recognized.  As night by night brightens to its dawn, if we watch the eastern horizon  and note what stars are the last to rise above it before the growing  daylight overpowers the feeble stellar rays, then we see that some  bright star, invisible on the preceding mornings, shines out for a few  moments low down in the glimmer of the dawn. As morning succeeds morning  it rises earlier, until at last it mounts when it is yet dark, and some  other star takes its place as the herald of the rising sun. We recognize  to-day this \"heliacal rising\" of the stars. Though we do not make use of  it in our system of time-measuring, it played an important part in the  calendar-making of the ancients. Such heralds of the rising sun were  called \"morning stars\" by the Hebrews, and they used them \"for seasons\"  and \"for years.\" One star or constellation of stars would herald by its  \"heliacal rising\" the beginning of spring, another the coming of winter;  the time to plough, the time to sow, the time of the rains, would all be  indicated by the successive \"morning stars\" as they appeared. And after  an interval of three hundred and sixty-five or three hundred and  sixty-six days the same star would again show itself as a morning star  for a second time, marking out the year, whilst the other morning stars  would follow, each in its due season. So we read in Job, that God led  \"forth the Mazzaroth in their season.\"    This wonderful procession of the midnight sky is not known and admired  by those who live in walled cities and ceiled houses, as it is by those  who live in the open, in the wilderness. It is not therefore to be  wondered at, that we find praise of these \"works of the Lord . . .  sought out of all them that have pleasure therein,\" mostly amongst the  shepherds, the herdsmen, the wanderers in the open--in the words and  prophecies of Job, of Jacob, Moses, David and Amos.    The thought that each new day, beginning with a new outburst of light,  was, in its degree, a kind of new creation, an emblem of the original  act by which the world was brought into being, renders appropriate and  beautiful the ascription of the term \"morning stars\" to those \"sons of  God,\" the angels. As the stars in the eastern sky are poetically thought  of as \"singing together\" to herald the creation of each new day, so in  the verses already quoted from the Book of Job, the angels of God are  represented as shouting for joy when the foundations of the earth were  laid.    The \"morning star\" again stands as the type and earnest of that new  creation which God has promised to His servants. The epistle to Thyatira  concludes with the promise--\"He that overcometh, and keepeth my works  unto the end, . . . I will give him the morning star.\"    The brightest of these heralds of the sun is the planet Venus, and such  a \"morning star\" for power, glory, and magnificence, the king of  Babylon had once been; like one of the angels of God. But as addressed  in Isaiah's prophecy, he has been brought down to Sheol:--         \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the       morning!. . . For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend       into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God       . . . I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be       like the most High.\"    But the \"morning star\" is taken as a higher type, even of our Lord  Himself, and of His future coming in glory. St. Peter bids the  disciples, to whom he writes, take heed unto the word of prophecy as  unto a lamp shining in a dark place \"until the day dawn, and the Day  star arise in your hearts.\" In almost the last words of the Bible, the  Lord uses the same image Himself:--         \"I, Jesus, have sent Mine angel to testify unto you these       things in the Churches. I am the root and the offspring of       David, the bright and morning star.\"    In the sublime and ordered movements of the various heavenly bodies, the  Hebrews recognized the ordinances of God. The point of view always taken  in Scripture is the theo-centric one; the relation sought to be brought  out is not the relation of thing to thing--which is the objective of  physical science--but the relation of creature to Creator. We have no  means of knowing whether they made attempt to find any mechanical  explanation of the movements; such inquiry would lie entirely outside  the scope of the books of Holy Scripture, and other ancient Hebrew  literature has not been transmitted to us.    The lesson which the Psalmists and the Prophets desired to teach was  not the daily rotation of the earth upon its axis, nor its yearly  revolution round the sun, but that--         \"If those ordinances depart from before Me, saith the Lord,       then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation       before Me for ever.\"    In the Bible all intermediate steps are omitted, and the result is  linked immediately to the first Cause. God Himself is the theme, and  trust in Him the lesson.         \"Lift up your eyes on high, and see Who hath created these,       That bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by       name; by the greatness of His might, and for that He is strong       in power, not one is lacking.         \"Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is       hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed away from my God.       Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the everlasting God,       the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not,       neither is weary; there is no searching of His understanding.       He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might He       increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary,       and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon       the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with       wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall       walk, and not faint.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE SUN         \"And God said Let there be lights in the firmament of the       heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for       signs, and for seasons and for days, and years: and let them       be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light       upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights;       the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to       rule the night: He made the stars also. And God set them in       the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and       to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the       light"]]]
