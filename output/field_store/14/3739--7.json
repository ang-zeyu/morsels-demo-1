Labourers were called from the field and commissioned at  once to set to work to reach the badgers.    \"The attempt was more than bold. The mouths of the set, three in number,  were at the foot of a hill, and embraced between them a sort of  triangular piece of land at the apex of which the passages all united  and formed a single underground gallery. The dogs having each entered by  a separate hole made this clear.    \"A shaft was sunk in order to start a tunnel at the opening of the  lowest hole, but a depth of 7 to 8 metres (23 to 26 feet) had to be sunk  before the passage was reached; thence they followed the direction taken  by the dogs, and enlarged the tunnel to reach them, making an  underground roadway 5 feet high (11/2 metres) and nearly 6 feet wide  (13/4 metres).    \"Whilst the workmen were mining, the badgers on their part were also  working ceaselessly, and kept blocking the road with the earth they  threw back in front of the men who were pursuing them, whilst the latter  worked in shifts (relieving parties). For three days and three nights  these indomitable animals worked on, retreating all the time, during  which they bored their way 49 feet whilst buried in this extension of  their principal earth without air or food.    \"At one time during this war _a outrance_ it was thought they had  escaped by some means or other, but the game terriers, which had hardly  left them since the beginning of the struggle, soon reassured the  workers by their redoubled cries. The undertaking was pushed on with  greater determination than ever, and when the tunnel had reached a  length of more than 30 metres (100 feet) they came on three badgers,  which were quickly popped into a sack by the keeper. One of them,  however, in his struggles succeeded in escaping from the sack, and even  tore the clothes of the man who was carrying him. MM. Cauvet and  d'Hallewyn showed a persistent perseverance during the whole of this  struggle. By day and by night each in turn directed the operations of a  siege at which more than one other lover of the pleasures of the chase  assisted.\"    I have given one or two out of many examples I could relate of the  arduous nature of badger-hunting. Discipline among the workmen is as  necessary as determination in every attempt to dig out badgers. Nothing  imperils success so much as divided or disputed authority, and whilst  every attention should be given to the opinions expressed in the  councils of war during the progress of the siege, there must be no  hesitation in carrying out the plan of campaign when once decided on, or  the day may be wasted in earthworks, in making trenches, and attempts to  cut off subterranean ways which have been begun only to be abandoned.  The terriers are the most important requisite; they must be good, the  right size, hardy, enduring, and reliable. No matter how game a dog is,  if he cannot follow the badger he is useless. He must above all be  full-mouthed, sharp-tongued, and ready to keep his voice going for hours  together. He must be absolutely true, or he may make a fool of you, and  lie fast in the earth baying an imaginary foe, or barking and scratching  to get up a small rabbit-hole. Beware of a terrier that will think of  such vermin when employed to fly at much higher game. They are worse  indeed than useless, and often have I been driven nearly wild by being  persuaded to allow some man proud of his terrier to let him go.    Nothing can be more exasperating than when, after several hours of heavy  labour and straining effort, whilst the proud owner stands smiling by  and boasting the merits of his nailing dog, you at length reach the  scene of all the disturbance to see a dirty little brute scratching his  feet to tatters, frothing at the mouth, and wow-wowing to get up a  three-inch rabbit-hole.    An authority in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ recommends collars of bells  being attached to the terriers to make the badger bolt, and states that  broad collars of badger-skin save their necks. The former I do not  believe to be efficacious, as fire, smoke, and crackers will not make a  badger bolt while any one is about, and if it were efficacious it would  be very easy to lose a bolting badger. A collar on a terrier is more  likely to hang a dog on a root end than to save him from a bite. A  terrier ninety-nine times out of a hundred is bitten through the muzzle,  under the jaws, and about the skull and ears, and when inexperienced,  about the fore-legs and shoulders. I never saw a terrier badly bitten in  the neck, though I have seen a terrier's side torn, and one that turned  tail punished severely in the rear. Whilst the terrier for badger should  be game to the death, it is all-important that he should mingle  discretion with his valour, and not drive his superior foe to  desperation, but content himself with keeping him at bay, only using his  teeth at a pinch and in extreme cases. Tell me, reader, how many  terriers you know who can or will go to ground, stay there, tell the  truth always, pass through every place a badger can, keep his head under  the most exasperating circumstances, and come up smiling and eager after  every round, no matter how much punished?    What thousands of little curs there are called terriers, and  fox-terriers that will no more go down a fox-earth than go up a chimney!  How many thousands of the best of these, however finely shaped for the  show-bench, that have no more idea of their profession and the duties  for which nature made them, and from which they derive their name, than  the man in the moon, and whose masters are satisfied if they can kill a  few rats, and think them wonderfully game if they will tackle a cat!    From my boyhood I have had terriers, but I never thought one worth  keeping that could not, or would not, go to ground and show himself or  herself worthy of their honourable name. Appearance is nothing if the  other qualities are not present. I have had a little wire-haired terrier  bitch (with neat, golden-tanned marked head), pretty and gentle, and  winning in all her ways, a companion that slept on my bed each night,  and looked the picture of innocence lying by the hearth or even on a  lady's lap; but within that bosom beat a courageous little heart, in her  head throbbed a brain full of sagacious intelligence, and in that soft  brown eye lurked hidden fire. She could give deep music long sustained,  and she never winced before the enemy. I called her \"Worry,\" a name that  seemed most _mal a propos_ to her casual acquaintance. For twelve long  years she was at my side in all the ups and downs of life, leading the  drag when I was at Cambridge, following foxhounds and bolting foxes  when I was hunting, and my constant and daily companion, accompanying me  into every county when I made an expedition against the badger. I was  once amused by the remarks made about Worry by an old shoemaker who  sometimes accompanied us with a good terrier when we were ratting. \"Si'  the (see thee), lads, Worry's t' yan (the one) fer (for) pickin' t' wick  (the life) out on 'em,\" as she threw five or six big rats over her  shoulder in half as many seconds. She died a terrible death, but game  and uncomplaining to the last. She had a knack of squeezing herself  through almost any kennel bars, and I had had to put her into a kennel  for a time, and had the bars made narrower and covered with mesh wire  netting. An hour after I had put her in I went to see her, and I was  horror-struck to find that she was half through the bars nipped as in a  vice, the wire torn with her teeth, and herself covered with blood and  wounds, with one eye hanging out, blood flowing from her mouth, still  fighting her way on--without a sound except her panting breath. She was  delighted to see me, and with some trouble I liberated her, cut off her  eye, staunched her wounds, and did all I could for her. She never even  winced as I cut away the eye, and as she lay in her bed looked at me  affectionately with her one eye and wagged her tail. The following day,  though she did not even whine, I saw she was in terrible pain; and as  she was at this time badly ruptured, and very lame owing to a carriage  accident some years before which resulted in a broken thigh and a double  fracture above the hock, I had her shot, and buried in a quiet corner of  the orchard, with the inscription on her headstone \"_Sit tibi terra  levis_.\"    The terriers I have found the best and surest are amongst the Yorkshire  breed of hard, wire-haired fox-terriers, short in the leg and strong  headed. All my own have been descended from a white, wire-haired terrier  called Fuss, the best bitch I ever had, and a prize-winner. I bought her  in 1870 or 1871 from a dealer called Wooton. She was bred by a man  called Jack Ridd. Worry was out of her. My brother got a dog, Roger, a  dead game one, at the same time from the same man, and nearly all the  terriers I have had since are descended from these two, with out-crosses  from local strains, including the Rev. Jack Russell's blood. I have seen  smooth-coated terriers do equally well, but not often. The former is a  harder and more enduring breed, though more difficult to keep clean in  the coat, and taking time to get dry after wet in cold weather. The  endurance of the wire-haired is remarkable. I have now a terrier, bred  through many lines of my old favourites, which is twelve years old. His  jolly face is scored with the marks of a thousand fights with fox and  badger, and though lame in his shoulders, his eyes dim with age, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#11)"],[1,"size or  weight, no peril is lessened, no tale shorn of minutest detail. All  these belong to the camp-fire, whether it is built in conformity to  scientific rules or piled clumsily by unskilled hands. What satisfaction  there is in the partnership of building this altar of the camp, for  though a master of woodcraft superintends, all may take a hand in its  erection; the youngest and the weakest may contribute a stick that will  brighten the blaze.           *       *       *       *       *    What hospitality the glow of the camp-fire proclaims in inviting always  one more to the elastic circle of light and warmth, that if always  complete, yet expands to receive another guest. A pillar of cloud by  day, of fire by night, it is a beacon that guides the wanderer to  shelter and comfort.           *       *       *       *       *    The Indian weed has never such perfect flavor as when, contending with  heat and smoke, one lights his pipe with a coal or an elusive flame,  snatched from the embers of the camp-fire, and by no other fireside does  the nicotian vapor so soothe the perturbed senses, bring such lazy  contentment, nor conjure such pleasant fancies out of the border of  dreamland.           *       *       *       *       *    There is no cooking comparable with that which the camp-fire affords. To  whatever is boiled, stewed, roasted, broiled or baked over its blaze, in  the glow of its embers or in its ashes, it imparts a distinctive woodsy  flavor that it distills out of itself or draws from the spiced air that  fans it; and the aroma of every dish invites an appetite that is never  disappointed if the supply be large enough.           *       *       *       *       *    It cannot be denied that the camp stove gives forth warmth and, with  more comfort to the cook, serves to cook food of such tame flavor as one  may get at home. But though the serviceable little imp roar till its  black cheeks glow red as winter berries, it cannot make shanty or tent a  camp in reality or impart to an outing its true flavor. This can only be  given by the generous camp-fire, whose flames and embers no narrow walls  inclose, whose hearth is on every side, whose chimney is the wide air.          XXIV    A RAINY DAY IN CAMP      The plans of the camper, like those of other men, \"gang aft agley.\" The  morrow, which he proposed to devote to some long-desired hunting or  fishing trip, is no more apt to dawn propitiously on him than on the  husbandman, the mariner, or any other mortal who looks to the weather  for special favor. On the contrary, instead of the glowing horizon and  the glory of the sunburst that should usher in the morning, the slow  dawn is quite apt to have the unwelcome accompaniment of rain.    The hearing, first alert of the drowsy senses, catches the sullen patter  of the drops on tent or shanty, their spiteful, hissing fall on the  smouldering embers of the camp-fire, and with a waft of damp earth and  herbage stealing into his nostrils, the disappointed awakener turns  fretfully under his blanket, then crawls forth to have his lingering  hope smothered in the veil of rain that blurs the landscape almost to  annihilation.    He mutters anathemas against the weather, then takes the day as it has  come to him, for better or for worse. First, to make the best of it, he  piles high the camp-fire, and dispels with its glow and warmth some  cubic feet of gloom and dampness. Then he sets about breakfast-making,  scurrying forth from shelter to fire, in rapid culinary forays, battling  with the smoke, for glimpses of the contents of kettle and pan. His  repast is as pungent with smoke as the strong waters of Glenlivat, but  if that is valued for its flavor of peat-reek, why should he scorn food  for the like quality?    Then if he delights in petty warfare with the elements, to bide the  pelting of the rain, to storm the abatis of wet thickets and suffer the  sapping and mining of insidious moisture, he girds up his loins and goes  forth with rod or gun, as his desire of conquest may incline him.    But if he has come to his outing with the intention of pursuing sport  with bodily comfort, he is at once assured that this is unattainable  under the present conditions of the weather. Shall he beguile the  tediousness of a wet day in camp with books and papers?    Nay, if they were not left behind in the busy, plodding world that he  came here to escape from, they should have been. He wants nothing here  that reminds him of traffic or politics; nothing of history, for now he  has only to do with the present; nothing of travel, for his concern now  is only with the exploration of this wild domain. He does not wish to be  bothered with fiction, idealized reality is what he desires. Neither  does he care for what other men have written of nature. Her book is  before him and he may read it from first hands.    Looking forth from his snug shelter on the circumscribed landscape, he  marvels at the brightness of a distant yellow tree that shines like a  living flame through the veil of mist. The blaze of his sputtering  camp-fire is not brighter. He notices, as perhaps he never did before,  how distinctly the dark ramage of the branches is traced among the  brilliant leaves, as if with their autumnal hues they were given  transparency. Some unfelt waft of the upper air casts aside for a moment  the curtain of mist and briefly discloses a mountain peak, radiant with  all the hues of autumn, and it is as if one were given, as in a dream, a  glimpse of the undiscovered country. He realizes a dreamy pleasure in  watching the waves coming in out of the obscurity and dashing on the  shore, or pulsing away in fading leaden lines into the mystery of the  wrack.    In the borders of the mist the ducks revel in the upper and nether  wetness, and with uncanny laughter the loon rejoices between his long  explorations of the aquatic depth. A mink, as heedless of rain as the  waterfowl, comes stealing along the shore, thridding the intricacies of  driftwood and web of wave-washed tree roots, often peering out in  inquisitive examination of the quiet camp. Less cautious visitors draw  nearer--the friendly chickadee, hanging from the nearest twig; the  nuthatch, sounding his penny trumpet, accompanied by the tap of the  woodpecker, as one creeps down, the other up a tree trunk; the scolding  jays, making as noisy protest over human intrusion as if they had just  discovered it; a saucy squirrel, scoffing and jeering, till tired of his  raillery he settles down to quiet nut-rasping under shelter of his tail.    There are unseen visitors, too: wood-mice, astir under cover of the  fallen leaves, and, just discernible among the patter of the falling  rain and of the squirrels' filings, footfalls unidentified, till a  ruffed grouse starts new showers from the wet branches in the thunder of  his flight.    Narrowed to the width of tent or shanty front, the background but a  pallid shroud of mist, the landscape yet holds much for pleasant study.  But if the weather-bound camper exhausts this or tires of it, he may  turn to gun-cleaning or tackle-mending. If a guide be with him, he can  listen to his stories of hunting, fishing, and adventure, or learn  woodcraft of him and the curious ways of birds and beasts. He may  fashion birch-bark camp-ware, dippers, cups, and boxes, or whittle a  paddle from a smooth-rifted maple. If he is of artistic turn, he can  pleasantly devote an hour to etching pictures on the white under surface  of the fungus that grows on decaying trees, and so provide himself with  reminders of this rainy day in camp.    So, with one and another pastime, he whiles away the sunless day, which,  almost before he has thought of it, merges into the early nightfall, and  he is lulled to sleep by the same sound that wakened him, the drip and  patter of the rain. And when he looks back to these days of outing he  may count this, which dawned so unpropitiously, not the least pleasant  and profitable among them, and mark with a white stone the rainy day in  camp.          XXV    AUGUST DAYS      With such unmistakable signs made manifest to the eye and ear the summer  signals its fullness and decline, that one awakening now from a sleep  that fell upon him months ago might be assured of the season with the  first touch of awakening.    To the first aroused sense comes the long-drawn cry of the locust fading  into silence with the dry, husky clap of his wings; the changed voice of  the song birds, no more caroling the jocund tunes of mating and nesting  time, but plaintive with the sadness of farewell.    The bobolink has lost, with his pied coat, the merry lilt that tinkled  so continually over the buttercups and daisies of the June meadows;  rarely the song sparrow utters the trill that cheered us in the doubtful  days of early spring. The bluebird's abbreviated carol floats down from  the sky as sweet as then, but mournful as the patter of autumn leaves.  The gay goldfinch has but three notes left of his June song, as he tilts  on the latest blossoms and fluffy seeds of the thistles. The meadowlark  charms us no more with his long-drawn melody, but with one sharp,  insistent note he struts in the meadow stubble or skulks among the  tussocks of the pasture and challenges the youthful gunner. What an easy  shot that even, steady flight offers, and yet it goes onward with  unfaltering rapid wing-beats, while the gun thunders and the harmless  shot flies behind him. The flicker cackles now no more as when he was a  jubilant new comer, with the new-come spring for his comrade, but is  silent or only yelps one harsh note as he flashes his golden wings in  loping flight from fence-stake to ant-hill.    The plover chuckles while he lingers at the bounteous feast of  grasshoppers, but never pierces the August air with the long wail that  proclaimed his springtime arrival. After nightfall, too, is heard his  chuckling call"]]]
