This principle is of such importance in the theory of spectrum analysis  that we add a further example. Let us take the element iron, which in a  very striking degree illustrates the law in question. In the solar  spectrum some hundreds of the dark lines are known to correspond with  the spectrum of iron. This correspondence is exhibited in a vivid manner  when, by a suitable contrivance, the light of an electric spark from  poles of iron is examined in the spectroscope side by side with the  solar spectrum. The iron lines in the sun are identical in position with  the lines in the spectrum of glowing iron vapour. But the spectrum of  iron, as here described, consists of bright lines; while those with  which it is compared in the sun are dark on a bright background. They  can be completely understood if we suppose the vapour arising from  intensely heated iron to be present in the atmosphere which surrounds  the luminous strata on the sun. This vapour would absorb or stop  precisely the same rays as it emits when incandescent, and hence we  learn the important fact that iron, no less than sodium, must, in one  form or another, be a constituent of the sun.    Such is, in brief outline, the celebrated discovery of modern times  which has given an interpretation to the dark lines of the solar  spectrum. The spectra of a large number of terrestrial substances have  been examined in comparison with the solar spectrum, and thus it has  been established that many of the elements known on the earth are  present in the sun. We may mention calcium, iron, hydrogen, sodium,  carbon, nickel, magnesium, cobalt, aluminium, chromium, strontium,  manganese, copper, zinc, cadmium, silver, tin, lead, potassium. Some of  the elements which are of the greatest importance on the earth would  appear to be missing from the sun. Sulphur, phosphorus, mercury, gold,  nitrogen may be mentioned among the elements which have hitherto given  no indication of their being solar constituents.    It is also possible that the lines of a substance in the sun's  atmosphere may be so very bright that the light of the continuous  spectrum, on which they are superposed, is not able to \"reverse\"  them--_i.e._ turn them into dark lines. We know, for instance, that the  bright lines of sodium vapour may be made so intensely bright that the  spectrum of an incandescent lime-cylinder placed behind the sodium  vapour does not reverse these lines. If, then, we make the sodium lines  fainter, they may be reduced to exactly the intensity prevailing in that  part of the spectrum of the lime-light, in which case the lines, of  course, could not be distinguished. The question as to what elements are  really missing from the sun must therefore, like many other questions  concerning our great luminary, at present be considered an open one. We  shall shortly see that an element previously unknown has actually been  discovered by means of a line representing it in the solar spectrum.    Let us now return to the sun-spots and see what the spectroscope can  teach us as to their nature. We attach a powerful spectroscope to the  eye-end of a telescope in order to get as much light as possible  concentrated on the slit; the latter has therefore to be placed exactly  at the focus of the object-glass. The instrument is then pointed to a  spot, so that its image falls on the slit, and the presence of the dark  central part called the _umbra_ reveals itself by a darkish stripe which  traverses the ordinary sun-spectrum from end to end. It is bordered on  both sides by the spectrum of the _penumbra_, which is much brighter  than that of the umbra, but fainter than that of the adjoining regions  of the sun.    From the fact that the spectrum is darkened we learn that there is  considerable general absorption of light in the umbra. This absorption  is not, however, such as would be caused by the presence of volumes of  minute solid or liquid particles like those which constitute smoke or  cloud. This is indicated by the fact, first discovered by Young in  1883, that the spectrum is not uniformly darkened as it would be if the  absorption were caused by floating particles. In the course of  examination of many large and quiescent spots, he perceived that the  middle green part of the spectrum was crossed by countless fine, dark  lines, generally touching each other, but here and there separated by  bright intervals. Each line is thicker in the middle (corresponding to  the centre of the spot) and tapers to a fine thread at each end; indeed,  most of these lines can be traced across the spectrum of the penumbra  and out on to that of the solar surface. The absorption would therefore  seem to be caused by gases at a much lower temperature than that of the  gases present outside the spot.    In the red and yellow parts of the spot-spectrum, which have been  specially studied for many years by Sir Norman Lockyer at the South  Kensington Observatory, interesting details are found which confirm this  conclusion. Many of the dark lines are not thicker and darker in the  spot than they are in the ordinary sun-spectrum, while others are very  much thickened in the spot-spectrum, such as the lines of iron, calcium,  and sodium. The sodium lines are sometimes both widened and doubly  reversed--that is, on the thick dark line a bright line is superposed.  The same peculiarity is not seldom seen in the notable calcium lines H  and K at the violet end of the spectrum. These facts indicate the  presence of great masses of the vapours of sodium and calcium over the  nucleus. The observations at South Kensington have also brought to light  another interesting peculiarity of the spot-spectra. At the time of  minimum frequency of spots the lines of iron and other terrestrial  elements are prominent among the most widened lines; at the maxima these  almost vanish, and the widening is found only amongst lines of unknown  origin.    The spectroscope has given us the means of studying other interesting  features on the sun, which are so faint that in the full blaze of  sunlight they cannot be readily observed with a mere telescope. We can,  however, see them easily enough when the brilliant body of the sun is  obscured during the rare occurrence of a total eclipse. The conditions  necessary for the occurrence of an eclipse will be more fully  considered in the next chapter. For the present it will be sufficient to  observe that by the movement of the moon it may so happen that the moon  completely hides the sun, and thus for certain parts of the earth  produces what we call a total eclipse. The few minutes during which a  total eclipse lasts are of much interest to the astronomer. Darkness  reigns over the landscape, and in that darkness rare and beautiful  sights are witnessed.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Prominences seen in Total Eclipse.]    We have in Fig. 19 a diagram of a total eclipse, showing some of the  remarkable objects known as prominences (_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_) which  project from behind the dark body of the moon. That they do not belong  to the moon, but are solar appendages of some sort, is easily  demonstrated. They first appear on the eastern limb at the commencement  of totality. Those first seen are gradually more or less covered by the  advancing moon, while others peep out behind the western limb of the  moon, until totality is over and the sunlight bursts out again, when  they all instantly vanish.    The first total eclipse which occurred after the spectroscope had been  placed in the hands of astronomers was in 1868. On the 18th August in  that year a total eclipse was visible in India. Several observers, armed  with spectroscopes, were on the look-out for the prominences, and were  able to announce that their spectrum consisted of detached bright lines,  thus demonstrating that these objects were masses of glowing gas. On the  following day the illustrious astronomer, Janssen, one of the observers  of the eclipse, succeeded in seeing the lines in full sunlight, as he  now knew exactly where to look for them. Many months before the eclipse  Sir Norman Lockyer had been preparing to search for the prominences, as  he expected them to yield a line spectrum which would be readily  visible, if only the sun's ordinary light could be sufficiently winnowed  away. He proposed to effect this by using a spectroscope of great  dispersion, which would spread out the continuous spectrum considerably  and make it fainter. The effect of the great dispersion on the isolated  bright lines he expected to see would be only to widen the intervals  between them without interfering with their brightness. The new  spectroscope, which he ordered to be constructed for this purpose, was  not completed until some weeks after the eclipse was over, though before  the news of Janssen's achievement reached Europe from India. When that  news did arrive Sir N. Lockyer had already found the spectrum of unseen  prominences at the sun's limb. The honour of the practical application  of a method of observing solar prominences without the help of an  eclipse must therefore be shared between the two astronomers.    When a spectroscope is pointed to the margin of the sun so that the slit  is radial, certain short luminous lines become visible which lie exactly  in the prolongation of the corresponding dark lines in the solar  spectrum. From due consideration of the circumstances it can be shown  that the gases which form the prominences are also present as a  comparatively shallow atmospheric layer all round the great luminary.  This layer is about five or six thousand miles deep, and is situated  immediately above the dense layer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#11)"],[1,"ute, a village in the diocese of Alais, where his father had  rented a small farm, which he gave up when his son was about fifteen,  coming to live at the farm of St. Andeol, near Mende.    Young Cavalier, who was only a peasant and the son of a peasant, began  life as a shepherd at the Sieur de Lacombe's, a citizen of Vezenobre,  but as the lonely life dissatisfied a young man who was eager for  pleasure, Jean gave it up, and apprenticed himself to a baker of Anduze.    There he developed a great love for everything connected with the  military; he spent all his free time watching the soldiers at their  drill, and soon became intimate with some of them, amongst others with a  fencing-master who gave him lessons, and a dragoon who taught him to  ride.    On a certain Sunday, as he was taking a walk with his sweetheart on his  arm, the young girl was insulted by a dragoon of the Marquis de Florae's  regiment. Jean boxed the dragoon's ears, who drew his sword. Cavalier  seized a sword from one of the bystanders, but the combatants were  prevented from fighting by Jean's friends. Hearing of the quarrel, an  officer hurried up: it was the Marquis de Florae himself, captain of the  regiment which bore his name; but when he arrived on the scene he found,  not the arrogant peasant who had dared to attack a soldier of the king,  but only the young girl, who had fainted, the townspeople having  persuaded her lover to decamp.    The young girl was so beautiful that she was commonly called la belle  Isabeau, and the Marquis de Florac, instead of pursuing Jean Cavalier,  occupied himself in reviving Isabeau.    As it was, however, a serious affair, and as the entire regiment had  sworn Cavalier's death, his friends advised him to leave the country for  a time. La belle Isabeau, trembling for the safety of her lover, joined  her entreaties to those of his friends, and Jean Cavalier yielded. The  young girl promised him inviolable fidelity, and he, relying on this  promise, went to Geneva.    There he made the acquaintance of a Protestant gentleman called Du  Serre, who having glass-works at the Mas Arritas, quite near the farm of  St. Andeol, had undertaken several times, at the request of Jean's  father, Jerome, to convey money to Jean; for Du Serre went very often to  Geneva, professedly on business affairs, but really in the interests of  the Reformed faith. Between the outlaw and the apostle union was  natural. Du Serre found in Cavalier a young man of robust nature, active  imagination, and irreproachable courage; he confided to him his hopes of  converting all Languedoc and Vivarais. Cavalier felt himself drawn back  there by many ties, especially by patriotism and love. He crossed the  frontier once more, disguised as a servant, in the suite of a Protestant  gentleman; he arrived one night at Anduze, and immediately directed his  steps to the house of Isabeau.    He was just about to knock, although it was one o'clock in the morning,  when the door was opened from within, and a handsome young man came out,  who took tender leave of a woman on the threshold. The handsome young  man was the Marquis de Florac; the woman was Isabeau. The promised wife  of the peasant had become the mistress of the noble.    Our hero was not the man to suffer such an outrage quietly. He walked  straight up to the marquis and stood right in his way. The marquis tried  to push him aside with his elbow, but Jean Cavalier, letting fall the  cloak in which he was wrapped, drew his sword. The marquis was brave,  and did not stop to inquire if he who attacked him was his equal or not.  Sword answered sword, the blades crossed, and at the end of a few  instants the marquis fell, Jean's sword piercing his chest.    Cavalier felt sure that he was dead, for he lay at his feet motionless.  He knew he had no time to lose, for he had no mercy to hope for. He  replaced his bloody sword in the scabbard, and made for the open  country; from the open country he hurried into the mountains, and at  break of day he was in safety.    The fugitive remained the whole day in an isolated farmhouse whose  inmates offered him hospitality. As he very soon felt that he was in the  house of a co-religionist, he confided to his host the circumstances in  which he found himself, and asked where he could meet with an organised  band in which he could enrol himself in order to fight for the  propagation of the Reformed religion. The farmer mentioned Generac as  being a place in which he would probably find a hundred or so of the  brethren gathered together. Cavalier set out the same evening for this  village, and arrived in the middle of the Camisards at the very moment  when they had just caught sight of M. de Broglie and his troops in the  distance. The Calvinists happening to have no leader, Cavalier with  governing faculty which some men possess by nature, placed himself at  their head and took those measures for the reception of the royal forces  of which we have seen the result, so that after the victory to which his  head and arm had contributed so much he was confirmed in the title which  he had arrogated to himself, by acclamation.    Such was the famous Jean Cavalier when the Royalists first learned of  his existence, through the repulse of their bravest troops and the death  of their most intrepid captain.    The news of this victory soon spread through the Cevennes, and fresh  conflagrations lit up the mountains in sign of joy. The beacons were  formed of the chateau de la Bastide, the residence of the Marquis de  Chambonnas, the church of Samson, and the village of Grouppieres, where  of eighty houses only seven were left standing.    Thereupon M. de Julien wrote to the king, explaining the serious turn  things had taken, and telling him that it was no longer a few fanatics  wandering through the mountains and flying at the sight of a dragoon  whom they had to put down, but organised companies well led and  officered, which if united would form an army twelve to fifteen hundred  strong. The king replied by sending M. le Comte de Montrevel to Nimes.  He was the son of the Marechal de Montrevel, chevalier of the Order of  the Holy Spirit, major-general, lieutenant of the king in Bresse and  Charolais, and captain of a hundred men-at-arms.    In their struggle against shepherds, keepers, and peasants, M. de  Brogue, M. de Julien, and M. de Baville were thus joined together with  the head of the house of Beaune, which had already at this epoch  produced two cardinals, three archbishops, two bishops, a viceroy of  Naples, several marshals of France, and many governors of Savoy,  Dauphine, and Bresse.    He was followed by twenty pieces of ordnance, five thousand bullets,  four thousand muskets, and fifty thousand pounds of powder, all of which  was carried down the river Rhone, while six hundred of the skilful  mountain marksmen called 'miquelets' from Roussillon came down into  Languedoc.    M de Montrevel was the bearer of terrible orders. Louis XIV was  determined, no matter what it cost, to root out heresy, and set about  this work as if his eternal salvation depended on it. As soon as M. de  Baville had read these orders, he published the following proclamation:    \"The king having been informed that certain people without religion  bearing arms have been guilty of violence, burning down churches and  killing priests, His Majesty hereby commands all his subjects to hunt  these people down, and that those who are taken with arms in their hands  or found amongst their bands, be punished with death without any trial  whatever, that their houses be razed to the ground and their goods  confiscated, and that all buildings in which assemblies of these people  have been held, be demolished. The king further forbids fathers,  mothers, brothers, sisters, and other relations of the fanatics, or of  other rebels, to give them refuge, food, stores, ammunition, or other  assistance of any kind, under any pretext whatever, either directly or  indirectly, on pain of being reputed accessory to the rebellion, and he  commands the Sieur de Baville and whatever officers he may choose to  prosecute such and pronounce sentence of death on them. Furthermore, His  Majesty commands that all the inhabitants of Languedoc who may be absent  at the date of the issue of this proclamation, return home within a  week, unless their absence be caused by legitimate business, in which  case they shall declare the same to the commandant, the Sieur de  Montrevel, or to the intendant, the Sieur de Baville, and also to the  mayors and consuls of the places where they may be, receiving from the  latter certificates that there is a sufficient reason for their delay,  which certificates they shall forward to the above-mentioned commandant  or intendant. And His Majesty furthermore commands the said commandant  and intendant to admit no foreigner or inhabitant of any other province  into Languedoc for commercial purposes or for any other reason  whatsoever, unless provided with certificates from the commandants or  intendants of the provinces whence they come, or from the judges of the  royal courts in the places whence they come, or from the nearest place  containing such courts. Foreigners must be provided with passports from  the ambassadors or ministers of the king accredited to the countries to  which they belong, or from the commandants or intendants of the  provinces, or from the judges of the royal courts of the places in which  they may be at the date of this proclamation. Furthermore, it is His  Majesty's will that those who are found in the, aforesaid province of  Languedoc without such certificates be regarded as fanatics and rebels,  and that they be prosecuted as such, and punished with death, and that  they be brought for this purpose before the aforesaid Sieur de Baville  or the officers whom he may choose.    \"(Signed) \"(Countersigned) \"LOUIS PHILIPPEAU    \"Given at Versailles the"]]]
