Five feet six inches; broad and muscular, but spare and clean-limbed.  Curly black hair, and a rosy-complexioned face, clean shaven--contrary  to the ordinary custom of the country--all except a thick drooping  moustache with waxed ends. A grey flannel shirt, with some stitching and  embroidery in front; and a blue silk scarf loosely tied below the  rolling collar. No coat this warm weather, but a little bouquet in the  breast of the shirt. A tasselled sash round the waist; spotless white  breeches, and well-blacked long boots. A Panama straw hat with broad  brim and much puggeree. An expression of affected innocence in the eyes,  and a good deal of fun about the mouth. Such is the figure we now look  upon for the first time.    Dandy Jack is a character; that one sees at once. He is generally  understood to have passed lightly through Eton and Oxford, to have sown  wild oats about Europe at large, to have turned up in Western America  and the Pacific, and to be now endeavouring to steady down in New  Zealand. He has a considerable spice of the devil in him, and is at once  the darling of the ladies and the delight of the men. For to the one he  is gallantry itself; while, to the other, he is the chum who can talk  best on any subject under the sun, with a fluency and power of anecdote  and quotation that is simply enchanting.    Just at present Dandy Jack has charge of the portage, as it is called,  between the Waitemata and the Kaipara rivers.[3] He drives the coach,  carries the mails, and bosses the bullock-drays that convey goods  between Riverhead and Helensville. And he is rapidly becoming the most  horsey man in the whole of the North, being especially active and  prominent in every possible capacity on the local race-courses.    Dinner is over very soon, and a very good one it was, well worth the  shilling each of us pays for it. Then we take leave of Dobbs and his  wife, whose future boss has arrived in a rude cart drawn by two horses,  in which to drive them and their traps over to his place in Ararimu. We  ourselves are going on to Helensville in the coach, a distance of about  eighteen miles.    The coach partakes of the crudity which seems impressed upon everything  in this new locality. The body of it is not much larger, apparently,  than a four-wheeled cab, and does not seem as if it could possibly  accommodate more than eight passengers altogether. Yet Dandy Jack avers  that he has carried over a score, and that he considers sixteen a proper  full-up load. On the present occasion there are not more than half a  dozen, besides my chum and I. Glass there is none about the coach, but a  good deal of leather. Springs, properly so-called, are also wanting. The  body is hung in some strong rude fashion on broad, substantial wheels.  Altogether, the machine looks as if it were intended for the roughest of  rough work.    As strangers, we are invited to occupy the seats of honour--on the box  beside the driver. There are no lady passengers to snatch the coveted  post from us. Dandy Jack says to me--    \"Of course, I should prefer to have a lady beside me, but, somehow, I'm  always glad when there arn't any. It's a grave responsibility--a grave  responsibility!\"    Whilst we are endeavouring to evolve the meaning of this mysterious  remark--it is not until a while later that we fully comprehend  it--preparations are being made for the start. Four ungroomed, unshod  horses are hitched on, and their plunging and capering shows they are  impatient to be off. Our driver's lieutenant, Yankee Bill, mounts a  fifth horse, and prepares to act as outrider. Then Dandy Jack, loudly  shouting, \"All aboard! All abo-ard!\" springs to his seat, gathers up the  reins, without waiting to see whether every one has obeyed his  injunction or not, bids the men who are holding the cattle stand clear,  gives a whoop and a shake of his whip, and then, with a jolt and a lurch  and a plunge, off we go.    Hitherto we have seen nothing of the settlement, except the hotel and  the goods warehouse on the bank above the wharf. These appear to have  been shot down into the middle of a moorland wilderness. But now, as the  coach surmounts some rising ground, several homesteads come into view,  scattered about within a distance of one or two miles. Beyond the  paddocks surrounding these, all of the country that is visible appears  to be covered with tall brown fern, and a low brushwood not unlike  heather.    As we go lumbering up the rise we are passed by a young lady riding down  towards the hotel. Very bright and pretty she looks, by contrast with  the rough surroundings. Quite a lovely picture, in her graceful  riding-habit of light drab, and her little billycock hat with its  brilliant feather. So think we all, especially our gallant Jehu, who  bows profoundly in response to a nod of recognition, and turns to look  admiringly after the fair equestrian.    Then, upon the right, we look down upon the great feature of the  district, Mr. Lamb's flour-mill and biscuit-factory. In this  establishment are made crackers that are well-known and much esteemed  far beyond the limits of New Zealand. The Riverhead manufacture is known  in the South Sea and Australia. The factory stands on the bank of the  creek, having water-power and a water highway at its door. It is a large  structure, mostly of timber, with a tall chimney of brick. Near it is  the residence of the proprietor, and a row of houses inhabited by his  employes. The whole is surrounded by a grove of choice trees and shrubs,  by gardens and paddocks, evidently in a high state of cultivation.  Beyond tower the brown and shaggy ranges, and all around is the uncouth  moorland. It is an oasis in the desert, this green and fertile spot, a  Tadmor in the wilderness.    Yet when we make some remarks, as new-chums will, about the apparent  richness of the land down there, a settler, who sits behind, takes us up  rather shortly. He appears to consider Mr. Lamb's estate as a positive  offence. \"Bone-dust and drainage!\" he says with a snort of contempt. It  seems that the land about us is considered to be of the very poorest  quality, sour gum-clay; and any one who sets about reclaiming such sort  is looked upon as a fool, at least, although, in this case, it is  evident that the cultivation is merely an ornamental subsidiary to the  factory.    But these poor lands are only bad comparatively. Much of the soil in  them is better by far than that of many productive farms at home; only  our colonial pioneer-farmers have no notion of any scientific methods in  agriculture. They have been spoilt by the wondrous fertility of the rich  black forest mould, and the virgin volcanic soils. They will continue to  regard manuring and draining and so forth as a folly and a sin almost,  until the population becomes numerous, and all the first-class lands are  filled up.    Fresh from high-dried systems and theories of agriculture as practised  in Great Britain, we are dumbfounded by the tirade against manuring, and  the revolutionary ideas which our coach-companion further favours us  with. We are evidently beginning to learn things afresh, though this is  our first day in the bush.    By the way, I must explain this term to English readers. \"Bush\" has a  double signification, a general and a particular one. In its first and  widest sense it is applied to all the country beyond the immediate  vicinity of the cities or towns. Thus, Riverhead may be described as a  settlement in the \"bush,\" and our road lies through the \"bush,\" though  here it is all open moorland. But, in a more particular way, \"bush\"  simply indicates the natural woods and forests. A farmer up-country, who  says he has been into the \"bush\" after cattle, means that he has been  into the forest, in contradistinction to his own cleared land, the  settlement, or the open country.    Our road lies at first through the fern lands beyond Riverhead, and we  soon lose sight of the settlement. We appear to be travelling at random  across the moor, for not a trace of what our English eyes have been  taught to regard as a road can we discern. The country is all a rugged  wilderness of range and gully: \"gently undulating,\" you say, if you want  to convey a favourable impression; \"abruptly broken and hilly,\" if you  would speak the literal truth. There is not a level yard of land--it is  all as rough and unequal as it is possible for land to be.    The road is no macadamized way: it is simply a track that, in many  parts, is barely visible except to practised eyes. Further on, where we  pass through tracts of forest, the axe has cleared a broad path; and  down some steep declivities there has been a mild attempt at a cutting.  Where we come upon streams of any size or depth, light wooden bridges  have been built; and fascines have made some boggy parts fordable in wet  weather. Such is our road, and along it we proceed at a hand-gallop for  the most part. The jolting may be imagined, it cannot be described; for  the four wheels are never by any chance on the same level at one and the  same time.    When we have proceeded eight or nine miles, Dandy Jack seems to be  preparing himself for some exciting incident. Yankee Bill gallops  alongside, exchanging a mysterious conversation in shouts with him.    \"Better take round by the ford, Cap!\"    \"Ford be blanked!\" answers Dandy Jack.    \"The rest of the planking's sure to be gone by this time,\" continues the  cavalier.    \"Then I reckon we'll jump it. Ford's two miles round at least, and we're  late now.\"    Our dandy charioteer glances round on his passengers, and remarks--    \"Hold on tight, boys; and, if we spill, spring clear for a soft place.\"    So saying, he plants his feet firmly out, takes a better grip of the  reins, and crams his hat well on to his head. We ignorant new-chums sit  perturbed, for we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#11)"],[1,"  liquor from it, and keep the fish hot while you heat up the liquor with  a good piece of butter rolled in flour, a tea-spoonful of mustard, a  little cayenne, and a spoonful of soy. Serve it on the dish, garnished  with lemon and parsley, and horse-radish, and put the gravy into the  sauce tureen.      BAKED CUSTARD. Boil a pint of cream and half a pint of milk with a  little mace, cinnamon and lemon peel. When cold, mix the yolks of three  eggs, and sweeten the custard. Make the cups or paste nearly full, and  bake them ten minutes.      BAKED HERRINGS. Wash and drain, without wiping them; and when drawn,  they should not be opened. Season with allspice in fine powder, salt,  and a few whole cloves. Lay them in a pan with plenty of black pepper,  an onion, and a few bay leaves. Add half vinegar and half small beer,  enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a slow oven.  If it be wished to make them look red, throw a little saltpetre over  them the night before.      BAKED MILK. A very useful article may be made for weakly and consumptive  persons in the following manner. Put a gallon of milk into a jar, tie  white paper over it, and let it stand all night in the oven when baking  is over. Next morning it will be as thick as cream, and may be drank two  or three times a day.      BAKED PEARS. Those least fit to eat raw, are often the best for baking.  Do not pare them, but wipe and lay them on tin plates, and bake them in  a slow oven. When done enough to bear it, flatten them with a silver  spoon; and when done through, put them on a dish. They should be baked  three or four times, and very gently.      BAKED PIKE. Scale and open it as near the throat as possible, and then  put in the following stuffing. Grated bread, herbs, anchovies, oysters,  suet, salt, pepper, mace, half a pint of cream, four yolks of eggs; mix  all over the fire till it thickens, and then sow it up in the fish.  Little bits of butter should be scattered over it, before it is sent to  the oven. Serve it with gravy sauce, butter and anchovy. In carving a  pike, if the back and belly be slit up, and each slice drawn gently  downwards, fewer bones will be given at table.      BAKED SOUP. A cheap and plentiful dish for poor families, or to give  away, may be made of a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices, with two  onions, two carrots sliced, two ounces of rice, a pint of split peas, or  whole ones if previously soaked, seasoned with pepper and salt. Put the  whole into an earthen jug or pan, adding a gallon of water: cover it  very close, and bake it.      BALM WINE. Boil three pounds of lump sugar in a gallon of water; skim it  clean, put in a handful of balm, and boil it ten minutes. Strain it off,  cool it, put in some yeast, and let it stand two days. Add the rind and  juice of a lemon, and let it stand in the cask six months.      BALSAMIC VINEGAR. One of the best remedies for wounds or bruises is the  balsamic or anti-putrid vinegar, which is made in the following manner.  Take a handful of sage leaves and flowers, the same of lavender, hyssop,  thyme, and savory; two heads of garlic, and a handful of salt. These are  to be infused in some of the best white-wine vinegar; and after  standing a fortnight or three weeks, it will be fit for use.      BANBURY CAKES. Work a pound of butter into a pound of white-bread dough,  the same as for puff paste; roll it out very thin, and cut it into bits  of an even form, the size intended for the cakes. Moisten some powder  sugar with a little brandy, mix in some clean currants, put a little of  it on each bit of paste, close them up, and bake them on a tin. When  they are taken out, sift some fine sugar over them.      BARBERRIES, when preserved for tarts, must be picked clean from the  stalks, choosing such as are free from stones. To every pound of fruit,  weigh three quarters of a pound of lump sugar; put the fruit into a  stone jar, and either set it on a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water,  and let them simmer very slowly till soft. Then put them and the sugar  into a preserving-pan, and boil them gently fifteen minutes.--To  preserve barberries in bunches, prepare some fleaks of white wool, three  inches long, and a quarter of an inch wide. Tie the stalks of the fruit  on the stick, from within an inch of one end to beyond the other, so as  to make them look handsome. Simmer them in some syrup two successive  days, covering them each time with it when cold. When they look clear,  they are simmered enough. The third day, they should be treated like  other candied fruit. See CANDIED.      BARBERRY DROPS. Cut off the black tops, and roast the fruit before the  fire, till it is soft enough to pulp with a silver spoon through a sieve  into a china bason. Then set the bason in a saucepan of water, the top  of which will just fit it, or on a hot hearth, and stir it till it grows  thick. When cold, put to every pint a pound and a half of double refined  sugar, pounded and sifted through a lawn sieve, which must be covered  with a fine linen, to prevent waste while sifting. Beat the sugar and  juice together three hours and a half if a large quantity, but two and a  half for less. Then drop it on sheets of white thick paper, the size of  drops sold in the shops. Some fruit is not so sour, and then less sugar  is necessary. To know when there is enough, mix till well incorporated,  and then drop. If it run, there is not enough sugar; and if there be too  much, it will be rough. A dry room will suffice to dry them. No metal  must touch the juice but the point of a knife, just to take the drop off  the end of the wooden spoon, and then as little as possible.      BARLEY BROTH. Wash three quarters of a pound of Scotch barley in a  little cold water, put it in a soup pot with a shin or leg of beef, or a  knuckle of veal of about ten pounds weight, sawn into four pieces. Cover  it with cold water, and set it on the fire; when it boils skim it very  clean, and put in two onions. Set it by the side of the fire to simmer  very gently about two hours; then skim off all the fat, put in two heads  of celery, and a large turnip cut into small squares. Season it with  salt, let it boil an hour and a half longer, and it is done. Take out  the meat carefully with a slice, cover it up and keep it warm by the  fire, and skim the broth well before it is put into the tureen. This  dish is much admired in Scotland, where it is regarded, not only as  highly nutricious, but as a necessary article of domestic economy: for  besides the excellent soup thus obtained, the meat also becomes an  agreeable dish, served up with sauce in the following manner. Reserve a  quart of the soup, put about an ounce of flour into a stewpan, pour the  liquor to it by degrees, stirring it well together till it boils. Add a  glass of port wine or mushroom ketchup, and let it gently boil up;  strain the sauce through a sieve over the meat, and add to it some  capers, minced gherkins, or walnuts. The flavour may be varied or  improved, by the addition of a little curry powder, ragout, or any other  store sauces.      BARLEY GRUEL. Wash four ounces of pearl barley, boil it in two quarts of  water and a stick of cinnamon, till reduced to a quart. Strain and  return it into the saucepan with some sugar, and three quarters of a  pint of port wine. It may be warmed up, and used as wanted.      BARLEY SUGAR. This well known article of confectionary is made in the  following manner. Put some common or clarified syrup into a saucepan  with a spout, such as for melting butter, if little is wanted to be  made, and boil it till it comes to what is called carimel, carefully  taking off whatever scum may arise; and having prepared a marble stone,  either with butter or sweet oil, just sufficiently to prevent sticking,  pour the syrup gently along the marble, in long sticks of whatever  thickness may be desired. While hot, twist it at each end; and let it  remain till cold, when it will be fit for immediate use. The rasped rind  of lemon, boiled up in the syrup, gives a very agreeable flavour to  barley sugar; and indeed the best is commonly so prepared.      BARLEY WATER. Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer it gently in  three pints of water, with a bit of lemon peel. Or boil an ounce of  pearl barley a few minutes to cleanse it, and then put on it a quart of  water. Simmer it an hour: when half done, put into it a piece of fresh  lemon peel, and one bit of sugar. If likely to be thick, add a quarter  of a pint of water, and a little lemon juice, if approved. This makes a  very pleasant drink for a sick person; but the former is less apt to  nauseate.      BASIL VINEGAR. Sweet basil is in full perfection about the middle of  August, when the fresh green leaves should be gathered, and put into a  wide-mouthed bottle. Cover the leaves with vinegar, and let them steep  for ten days. If it be wished to have the infusion very strong, strain  out the liquor, put in some fresh leaves, and let them steep for ten  days more. This is a very agreeable addition to sauces and soups, and to  the mixture usually made for salads.      BASILICON. Yellow basilicon is made of equal quantities of bees-wax,  white rosin, and frankincense. Melt them together over a slow fire, add  the same weight of fresh lard, and strain it off while it is warm. This  ointment is used for cleansing and healing wounds and ulcers.      BASKET SALT. This fine and delicate article is chiefly made from the  salt springs in Cheshire, and differs from the common brine salt,  usually called sea salt, not only in its whiteness and purity, but in  the fineness of its grain. Some families entertain prejudices against  basket salt, notwithstanding its superior delicacy, from an idea, which  does not appear warranted, that pernicious articles are used in its  preparation; it may therefore be proper to mention, that by dissolving  common salt, again evaporating into dryness, "]]]
