The line of  snow-covered peaks, composed mainly of crystalline rocks and forming a  core to the Himalaya in a way analogous to the granitic core of the  Alps, occupies what was once apparently the northern shore of  Gondwanaland, and to the north of it there stretched the great ocean of  Tethys, covering the central parts of Asia and Europe, one of its  shrunken relics being the present Mediterranean Sea. The bed of this  ocean throughout many geological ages underwent gradual depression and  received the sediments brought down by the rivers from the continent  which stretched away to the south. The sedimentary deposits thus formed  near the shore-line or further out in deep water attained a thickness of  well over 20,000 feet, and have been studied in the _tahsil_ of Spiti,  on the northern border of Kumaon, and again on the eastern Tibetan  plateau to the north of Darjeeling. A reference to the formations  preserved in Spiti may be regarded as typical of the geological history  and the conditions under which these formations were produced.    ~Succession of Fossiliferous Beds.~--In age the fossiliferous beds range  from Cambrian right through to the Tertiary epoch; between these  extremes no single period was passed without leaving its records in some  part of the great east-to-west Tibetan basin. At the base of the whole  succession there lies a series of schists which have been largely  metamorphosed, and on these rest the oldest of the fossiliferous series,  which, on account of their occurring in the region of snow, has been  named the _Haimanta system_. The upper part of the Haimanta system has  been found to contain the characteristic trilobites of the Cambrian  period of Europe. Over this system lie beds which have yielded in  succession Ordovician and Silurian fossils, forming altogether a compact  division which has been distinguished locally as the _Muth system_. Then  follows the so-called _Kanawar system_, which introduces Devonian  conditions, followed by fossils characteristic of the well-known  mountain limestone of Europe.    Then occurs a break in the succession which varies in magnitude in  different localities, but appears to correspond to great changes in the  physical geography which widely affect the Indian region. This break  corresponds roughly to the upper part of the Carboniferous system of  Europe, and has been suggested as a datum line for distinguishing in  India an older group of fossiliferous systems below (formed in an area  that has been distinguished by the name _Dravidian_), from the younger  group above, which has been distinguished by the name _Aryan_.    During the periods that followed this interruption the bed of the great  Eurasian Ocean seems to have subsided persistently though  intermittently. As the various sediments accumulated the exact position  of the shore-line must have changed to some extent to give rise to the  conditions favourable for the formation at one time of limestone, at  another of shale and at other times of sandy deposits. The whole column  of beds, however, seems to have gone on accumulating without any folding  movements, and they are consequently now found lying apparently in  perfect conformity stage upon stage, from those that are Permian in age  at the base, right through the Mesozoic group, till the time when  Tertiary conditions were inaugurated and the earth movements began which  ultimately drove back the ocean and raised the bed, with its accumulated  load of sediments, into the great folds that now form the Himalayan  Range. This great mass of Aryan strata includes an enormous number of  fossil remains, giving probably a more complete record of the gradual  changes that came over the marine fauna of Tethys than any other area of  the kind known. One must pass over the great number of interesting  features still left unmentioned, including the grand architecture of the  Sub-Himalaya and the diversity of formations in different parts of the  Frontier Province; for the rest of the available space must be devoted  to a brief reference to the minerals of value.    ~Rock-salt~, which occurs in abundance, is possibly the most important  mineral in this area. The deposits most largely worked are those which  occur in the well-known Salt Range, covering parts of the districts of  Jhelam, Shahpur, and Mianwali. Near the village of Kheora the main seam,  which is being worked in the Mayo mines, has an aggregate thickness of  550 feet, of which five seams, with a total thickness of 275 feet,  consist of salt pure enough to be placed on the table with no more  preparation than mere pulverising. The associated beds are impregnated  with earth, and in places there occur thin layers of potash and  magnesian salts. In this area salt quarrying was practised for an  unknown period before the time of Akbar, and was continued in a  primitive fashion until it came under the control of the British  Government with the occupation of the Panjab in 1849. In 1872 systematic  mining operations were planned, and the general line of work has been  continued ever since, with an annual output of roughly 100,000 tons.    Open quarries for salt are developed a short distance to the  east-north-east of Kalabagh on the Indus, and similar open work is  practised near Kohat in the North West Frontier Province, where the  quantity of salt may be regarded as practically inexhaustible. At  Bahadur Khel the salt lies at the base of the Tertiary series, and can  be traced for a distance of about eight miles with an exposed thickness  of over 1000 feet, sometimes standing up as hills of solid salt above  the general level of the plains. In this area the production is  naturally limited by want of transport and the small local demand, the  total output from the quarries being about 16,000 tons per annum. A  small quantity of salt (generally about 4000 tons a year), is raised  also from open quarries in the Mandi State, where the rock-salt beds,  distinctly impure and earthy, lie near the junction between Tertiary  formations and the older unfossiliferous groups.    ~Coal~ occurs at numerous places in association with the Nummulitic  limestones of Lower Tertiary age, in the Panjab, in the North West  Frontier Province, and in the Jammu division of Kashmir. The largest  output has been obtained from the Salt Range, where mines have been  opened up on behalf of the North Western Railway. The mines at Dandot in  the Jhelam district have considerable fluctuations in output, which,  however, for many years ranged near 50,000 tons. These mines, having  been worked at a financial loss, were finally abandoned by the Railway  Company in 1911, but a certain amount of work is still being continued  by local contractors. At Bhaganwala, 19 miles further east, in the  adjoining district of Shahpur, coal was also worked for many years for  the North Western State Railway, but the maximum output in any one year  never exceeded 14,000 tons, and in 1900, owing to the poor quality of  material obtained, the collieries were closed down. Recently, small  outcrop workings have been developed in the same formation further west  on the southern scarp of the Salt Range at Tejuwala in the Shahpur  district.    ~Gold~ to a small amount is washed from the gravel of the Indus and some  other rivers by native workers, and large concessions have been granted  for systematic dredging, but these enterprises have not yet reached the  commercially paying stage.    ~Other Metals.~--Prospecting has been carried on at irregular intervals in  Kulu and along the corresponding belt of schistose rocks further west in  Kashmir and Chitral. The copper ores occur as sulphides along certain  bands in the chloritic and micaceous schists, similar in composition and  probably in age to those worked further east in Kumaon, in Nipal, and in  Sikkim. In Lahul near the Shigri glacier there is a lode containing  ~antimony~ sulphide with ores of ~zinc~ and ~lead~, which would almost  certainly be opened up and developed but for the difficulty of access  and cost of transport to the only valuable markets.    ~Petroleum~ springs occur among the Tertiary formations of the Panjab and  Biluchistan, and a few thousand gallons of oil are raised annually.  Prospecting operations have been carried on vigorously during the past  two or three years, but no large supplies have so far been proved. The  principal oil-supplies of Burma and Assam have been obtained from rocks  of Miocene age, like those of Persia and the Caspian region, but the  most promising \"shows\" in North West India have been in the older  Nummulitic formations, and the oil is thus regarded by some experts as  the residue of the material which has migrated from the Miocene beds  that probably at one time covered the Nummulitic formations, but have  since been removed by the erosive action of the atmosphere.    ~Alum~ is manufactured from the pyritous shales of the Mianwali district,  the annual output being generally about 200 to 300 tons. Similar shales  containing pyrites are known to occur in other parts of this area, and  possibly the industry might be considerably extended, as the annual  requirements of India, judged by the import returns, exceed ten times  the native production of alum.    ~Borax~ is produced in Ladakh and larger quantities are imported across  the frontier from Tibet.

The defence of the colony against enemies, the construction of the  cells, the storing of them with honey and bee-bread, the rearing of the  young, in short, the whole work of the hive, the laying of eggs  excepted, is carried on by the industrious little workers.    There may be _gentlemen_ of leisure in the commonwealth of bees, but  most assuredly there are no such _ladies_, whether of high or low  degree. The queen herself, has her full share of duties, for it must be  admitted that the royal office is no sinecure, when the mother who fills  it, must superintend daily the proper deposition of several thousand  eggs!      AGE OF BEES.    The queen bee, (as has been already stated,) will live four, and  sometimes, though very rarely, five years. As the life of the drones is  usually cut short by violence, it is not easy to ascertain its precise  limit. Bevan, in some interesting statements on the longevity of bees,  estimates it not to exceed four months. The workers are supposed by him,  to live six or seven months. Their age depends, however, very much upon  their greater or less exposure to injurious influences and severe  labors. Those reared in the spring and early part of summer, and on whom  the heaviest labors of the hive must necessarily devolve, do not appear  to live more than two or three months, while those which are bred at the  close of summer, and early in autumn, being able to spend a large part  of their time in repose, attain a much greater age. It is very evident  that \"the bee,\" (to use the words of a quaint old writer,) \"is a summer  bird,\" and that with the exception of the queen, none live to be a year  old.    Notched and ragged wings, instead of gray hairs and wrinkled faces, are  the signs of old age in the bee, and indicate that its season of toil  will soon be over. They appear to die rather suddenly, and often spend  their last days, and sometimes even their last hours, in useful labors.  Place yourself before a hive, and see the indefatigable energy of these  aged veterans, toiling along with their heavy burdens, side by side with  their more youthful compeers, and then say if you can, that _you_ have  done work enough, and that you will give yourself up to slothful  indulgence, while the ability for useful labor still remains. Let the  cheerful hum of their industrious old age inspire you with better  resolutions, and teach you how much nobler it is to meet death in the  path of duty, striving still, as you \"have opportunity,\" to \"do good  unto all men.\"    The age which individual members of the community may attain, must not  be confounded with that of the colony. Bees have been known to occupy  the same domicile for a great number of years. I have seen flourishing  colonies which were twenty years old, and the Abbe Della Rocca speaks  of some over forty years old! Such cases have led to the erroneous  opinion that bees are a long-lived race. But this, as Dr. Evans has  observed, is just as wise as if a stranger, contemplating a populous  city, and personally unacquainted with its inhabitants, should on paying  it a second visit, many years afterwards, and finding it equally  populous, imagine that it was peopled by the same individuals, not one  of whom might then be living.        \"Like leaves on trees, the race of bees is found,      Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;      Another race the Spring or Fall supplies,      They droop successive, and successive rise.\"    The cocoons spun by the larvae, are never removed by the bees; they stick  so closely to the sides of the cells, that the knowing bee well  understands that the labor of removal would cost more than it would be  worth. In process of time, the breeding cells become too small for the  proper development of the young. In some cases, the bees must take down  and reconstruct the old combs, for if they did not, the young issuing  from them would always be dwarfs; whereas I once compared with other  bees, those of a colony more than fifteen years old, and found no  perceptible difference. That they do not always renew the old combs,  must be admitted, as the young from some old hives are often  considerably below the average size. On this account, it is very  desirable to be able to remove the old combs occasionally, that their  place may be supplied with new ones.    It is a great mistake to imagine that the brood combs ought to be  changed every year. In my hives, they might, if it were desirable, be  easily changed several times in a year: but once in five or six years is  often enough; oftener than this requires a needless consumption of honey  to replace them, besides being for other reasons undesirable, as the  bees are always in winter, colder in new comb than in old. Inventors of  hives have too often been, most emphatically \"men of one idea:\" and that  one, instead of being a well established and important fact in the  physiology of the bee, has frequently, (like the necessity for a yearly  change of the brood combs,) been merely a conceit, existing nowhere but  in the brain of a visionary projector. This is all harmless enough,  until an effort is made to impose such miserable crudities upon an  ignorant public, either in the shape of a patented hive, _or worse  still, of an UNPATENTED hive, the pretended RIGHT to use which, is  FRAUDULENTLY sold to the cheated purchaser_!!    For want of proper knowledge with regard to the age of bees, huge \"bee  palaces,\" and large closets in garrets or attics, have been constructed,  and their proprietors have vainly imagined that the bees would fill  them, however roomy; for they can see no reason why a colony should not  continue to increase indefinitely, until at length it numbers its  inhabitants by millions or billions! As the bees can never at one time  equal, still less exceed the number which the queen is capable of  producing in one season, these spacious dwellings have always an  abundance of \"spare rooms.\" It seems strange that men can be thus  deceived, when often in their own Apiary, they have healthy stocks which  have not swarmed for a year or more, and which yet in the spring are not  a whit more populous than those which have regularly parted with  vigorous swarms.    It is certain that the Creator, has for some wise reason, set a limit to  the increase of numbers in a single colony; and I shall venture to  assign what appears to me to have been one reason for His so doing.  Suppose that He had given to the bee, a length of life as great as that  of the horse or the cow, or had made each queen capable of laying  daily, some hundreds of thousands of eggs, or had given several hundred  queens to each hive, then from the Very nature of the case, a colony  must have gone on increasing, until it became a scourge rather than a  benefit to man. In the warm climates of which the bee is a native, they  would have established themselves in some cavern or capacious cleft in  the rocks, and would there have quickly become so powerful as to bid  defiance to all attempts to appropriate the avails of their labors.    It has already been stated, that none, except the mother wasps and  hornets, survive the winter. If these insects had been able, like the  bee, to commence the season with the accumulated strength of a large  colony, long before its close, they would have proved a most intolerable  nuisance. If, on the contrary, the queen bee had been compelled,  solitary and alone, to lay the foundations of a new commonwealth, the  honey-harvest would have disappeared before she could have become the  parent of a numerous family.    In the laws which regulate the increase of bees as well as in all other  parts of their economy, we have the plainest proofs that the insect was  formed for the special service of the human race.      THE PROCESS OF REARING THE QUEEN MORE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED.    If in the early part of the season, the population of a hive becomes  uncomfortably crowded, the bees usually make preparations for swarming.  A number of royal cells are commenced, and they are placed almost always  upon those edges of the combs which are not attached to the sides of the  hive. These cells somewhat resemble a small ground-nut or pea-nut, and  are about an inch deep, and one-third of an inch in diameter: they are  very thick, and require a large quantity of material for their  construction. They are seldom seen in a perfect state, as the bees  nibble them away after the queen has hatched, leaving only their  remains, in the shape of a very small acorn-cup. While the other cells  open sideways, these always hang with their mouth _downwards_. Much  speculation has arisen as to the reason for this deviation: some have  conjectured that their peculiar position exerted an influence upon the  development of the royal larvae; while others, having ascertained that no  injurious effect was produced by turning them upwards, or placing them  in any other position, have considered this deviation as among the  inscrutable mysteries of the bee-hive. So it always seemed to me, until  more careful reflection enabled me to solve the problem. The queen cells  open downwards, simply _to save room_! The distance between the parallel  ranges of comb being usually less than half an inch, the bees could not  have made the royal cells to open sideways, without sacrificing the  cells opposite to them. In order to economize space, to the very utmost,  they put them upon the unoccupied edges of the comb, as the only place  where there is always plenty of room for such very large cells.    The number of royal cells varies greatly; sometimes there are only two  or three, ordinarily there are five or six, and I have occasionally seen  more than a dozen. They are not all commenced at once, for the bees do  not intend that the young queens shall all arrive at maturity, at the  same time. I do "]]]
