His eyes flickered, however, and he  found the device Jamison had inserted. A speaking-tube of sorts. Not  especially efficient, but inconspicuous enough. He stirred listlessly  and got his lips near it.    \"All right to talk?\" he asked briefly.    \"Shoot,\" said Jamison from the secretary's seat beside the chauffeur.  \"This man doesn't understand English, and he thinks I'm in a smuggling  gang. He expects to make some money out of me eventually.\"    Bell spoke curtly, while the taxi rolled past the Morro da Gloria with  its quaint old church and went along the winding, really marvelous  driveway past many beaches, with the incredibly blue water beyond.    \"Canalejas is out of town,\" he said. \"It isn't known when he'll be  back. I met his daughter at a dance at our Embassy here, and she told  me. We didn't dare to talk much, but she's frightened. Especially  after what happened to Ortiz. And I've met Ribiera, whom Ortiz named.\"    \"I've been looking him up,\" growled Jamison through the speaking-tube.           *       *       *       *       *    Bell flicked the ash from his cigarette out the door, and went on  quietly.    \"He's trying to get friendly with me. I've promised to call at his  house and have him take me out to the flying field. He has two planes,  he tells me, a big amphibian and a two-seater. Uses them for commuting  between Rio and his place back inland. He went out of his way to  cultivate me. I think he suspects I'm trying to find out something.\"    \"Which you are,\" said Jamison dryly. \"You've found out that Ortiz was  right at least about--\"    Bell nodded, and frowned at himself for having nodded. He spoke into  the mouthpiece by his head with an expressionless face.    \"He's practically fawned upon by a bunch of important officials and  several high ranking army officers. Suspecting what I do, I think he's  got hold of a devil of a lot of power.\"    Jamison scowled in a lordly fashion upon a mere pedestrian who  threatened to impede the movement of the taxicab by making it run over  him.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Ortiz,\" said Bell quietly, \"told me he'd been poisoned, and treason  asked as the price of the antidote. I've heard that the Brazilian  Minister for Foreign Affairs went insane six months ago. I heard,  also, that it was homicidal mania--murder madness. And I'm wondering  if these people who fawn upon Ribiera aren't paying a price  for--well--antidotes, or their equivalent. The Minister for Foreign  Affairs may have refused.\"    \"You're improving,\" said Jamison dryly. The taxi rounded a curve and  a vista of sea and sand and royal palms spread out before it. \"Yes,  you're improving. But Ortiz spoke of Ribiera only as a deputy of The  Master. Who is The Master?\"    \"God knows,\" said Bell. He stared languidly out of the window, for all  the world to see. A tourist, regarding the boasted beauties of the  Biera Mar.    \"A deputy,\" said Jamison without emotion, \"of some unknown person  called The Master poisoned Ortiz in Buenos Aires. And Ortiz was an  important man in the Argentine. Ribiera is merely the deputy of that  same unknown Master in Rio, and he has generals and state presidents  and the big politicians paying court to him. If deputies in two  countries that we know of have so much power, how much power has The  Master?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Silence. The taxi chugged steadily past unnoticed beauties and  colorings. Rio is really one of the most beautiful cities in the  world.    \"It's like this,\" said Jamison jerkily. \"Seven Service men vanish and  one goes mad. You get two tips that the fate of Ortiz is the fate of  the seven men--eight, in fact. We find that two men dispense a certain  ghastly poison in two certain cities, at the orders of a man they call  The Master. We find that those two men wield an astounding lot of  power, and we know they're only deputies, only subordinates of the  Master. We know, also, that the Service men vanished all over the  whole continent, not in just those two cities. How many deputies has  The Master? What's it all about? He wanted treason of Ortiz, we know.  What does he want of the other men his deputies have enslaved? Why did  he poison the Service men? And why--especially why--do two honorable  men, officials of two important nations, want to tip off the United  States Government about the ghastly business? What's it got to do with  our nation?\"    Bell flung away his cigarette.    \"That last question has occurred to me too,\" he observed, and  carefully repressed a slight shiver. \"I have made a guess, which is  probably insane. I'm going to see Ribiera this afternoon.\"    \"He already suspects you know too much,\" said Jamison without  expression.    \"I am\"--Bell managed the ghost of a mirthless smile--\"I am  uncomfortably aware of it. And I may need an antidote as badly as  Ortiz. If I do, and can't help myself, I'll depend on you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jamison growled.    \"I simply mean,\" said Bell very quietly, \"that I'd really rather not  be--er--left alive if I'm mad. That's all. But Ortiz knew what was the  matter with him before he got bad off. I know it's a risk. I'm  goose-flesh all over. But somebody's got to take the risk. The guess  I've made may be insane, but if it's right one or two lives will be  cheap enough as a price for the information. Suppose you chaps turn  around and take me to Ribiera's house?\"    There was a long pause. Then Jamison spoke in Portuguese to his  companion. The taxi checked, swerved, and began to retrace its route.    \"You're a junior in the Trade,\" said Jamison painstakingly. \"I can't  order you to do it.\"    Bell fumbled with his cigarette case.    \"The Trade doesn't exist, Jamison,\" he said dryly. \"And besides,  nobody gives orders in The Trade. There are only suggestions. Now shut  up a while. I want to try to remember some consular reports I read  once, from the consul at Puerto Pachecho.\"    \"What?\"    \"The consul there,\" said Bell, smiling faintly, \"was an amateur  botanist. He filled up his consular reports with accounts of native  Indian medicinal plants and drugs, with copious notes and clinical  observations. I had to reprove him severely for taking up space with  such matters and not going fully into the exact number of hides, wet  and dry, that passed through the markets in his district. His  information will be entirely useless in this present emergency, but  I'm going to try to remember as much of it as I can. Now shut up.\"           *       *       *       *       *    When the taxi swung off the Biera Mar to thread its way through many  tree-lined streets--it is a misdemeanor, punishable by fine, to cut  down a tree in Rio de Janeiro--it carried a young American with the  air of an accomplished idler, who has been mildly bored by the  incomparable view from the waterside boulevard. When it stopped at the  foot of one of the slum covered _morros_ that dot all Rio, and a  liveried doorman came out of a splendid residence to ask the visitor  his name, the taxi discharged a young American who seemed to feel the  heat, in spite of the swift motion of the cab. He wiped off his  forehead with his handkerchief as he was assured that the Senhor  Ribiera had given orders he was to be admitted, night or day. When the  taxi drove off, it carried two men on the chauffeur's seat, of whom  one had lost, temporarily, the manner of haughty insolence which is  normally inseparable from the secretary of a taxicab chauffeur.    But though he wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, Bell actually  felt rather cold when he followed his guide through ornately furnished  rooms, which seemed innumerable, and was at last left to wait in an  especially luxurious salon.    There was a pause. A rather long wait. A distinctly long wait. Bell  lighted a cigarette and seemed to become mildly bored. He regarded a  voluptuous small statuette with every appearance of pleased interest.  A subtly decadent painting seemed to amuse him considerably. He did  not seem to notice that no windows at all were visible, and that  shaded lamps lit this room, even in broad daylight.           *       *       *       *       *    Two servants came in, a footman in livery and the major-domo. Your  average _Carioca_ servant is either fawning or covertly insolent.  These two were obsequious. The footman carried a tray with a bottle,  glass, ice, and siphon.    \"The Senhor Ribiera,\" announced the major-domo obsequiously, \"begs  that the Senhor Bell will oblige him by waiting for the shortest of  moments until the Senhor Ribiera can relieve himself of a business  matter. It will be but the shortest of moments.\"    Bell felt a little instinctive chill at sight of the bottle and  glasses.    \"Oh, very well,\" he said idly. \"You may put the tray there.\"    The footman lifted the siphon expectantly. Bell regarded it  indifferently. The wait before the arrival of this drink had been  longer than would be required merely for the announcing of a caller  and the tending of a tray, especially if such a tray were a custom of  the place. And the sending of a single bottle only, without inquiry  into his preferences....    \"No soda,\" said Bell. He poured out a drink into the tinier glass. He  lifted it toward his lips, hesitated vaguely, and drew out his  handkerchief again.    He sneezed explosively, and the drink spilled. He swore irritably, put  down the glass, and plied his handkerchief vigorously. A moment later  he was standing up and pouring the drink out afresh, from the bottle  in one hand to the glass in the other. He up-tilted the glass.    \"Get rid of this for me,\" he said annoyedly of the handkerchief.           *       *       *       *       *    He saw a nearly imperceptible glance pass between the footman and the  major-domo. They retired, and Bell moved about the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#11)"],[1,"ses, and each suddenly  closes his wings, falls to the earth and hides against the soil. But  some have mounted so high to pour out their clear song that they  cannot hope to reach the earth before being seized. Then, knowing that  the bird of prey is to be feared when he occupies a more elevated  position from which he can throw himself on them, they endeavour to  remain always above him. They mount higher and higher. The enemy seeks  to pass them, but they mount still, until at last the Hobby, heavier,  and little accustomed to this rarefied air, grows tired and gives up  the pursuit.[37]       [37] _Naturgeschichte der Voegel Deutschlands_, etc.    The Gold-winged Woodpecker of the United States (_Colaptes auratus_)  often escapes Falcons either by throwing himself into the first hole  that he finds, or if he cannot find one, through seizing the trunk of  a tree with his claws. As he is a very good climber, he describes  rapid spirals around it, and the falcon cannot in flying trace such  small circles. By this method the _Colaptes_ usually escapes.[38]       [38] Audubon, _Ornithological Biography_, New York and          Edinburgh, 1831-49.    The Fox, who is so ingenious in hunting, is not less so when his own  safety is concerned. He knows when it is best to flee or to remain; he  is suspicious in a surprising degree, not only of man but also of the  engines which man prepares against him. He recognises them or smells  them. Certain facts almost lead us to suspect that he understands  their mechanism. When one of them has been surprised in his hole, and  the trap has been placed before every opening, he will not emerge from  the burrow. If hunger becomes too imperious, he recognises that  patience will only change the manner of his death, and then he decides  to dare fate; but previously he had done everything to flee without  passing over the snare. As long as he had claws and strength he  hollowed out the earth to form a new issue, but hunger rapidly  exhausted his vigour and he was not able to complete the work. Foxes  thus trapped have recognised immediately when one of these engines  went off, either owing to another animal being caught or from some  other reason. In this case the captive understands very well that the  mechanism has produced its effect, that it is no longer to be dreaded,  and he boldly emerges.    It has happened that foxes have been caught in a trap by a paw or else  by the tail, when delicately endeavouring to extract the bait.  Recognising the manner in which they are retained prisoners, certain  of them have had the intelligence and the courage to cut off with  their teeth the part engaged in the trap, and to escape thus  mutilated. St. John knew a fox who thus escaped by amputating a paw,  and who was able to earn his living for three or four years  subsequently, when he was finally caught.    In Australia great kangaroo hunts are organised. Generally the capture  is sufficiently easy, and the dogs are able to seize the kangaroo, but  sometimes he makes a long and rather original defence. If possible, he  directs his flight towards a river. If he reaches it he enters, and,  thanks to his great height, he is able to go on foot to a depth where  the dogs are obliged to swim. Arrived there, he plants himself on his  two posterior legs and his tail, and, up to his shoulders in the  water, awaits the arrival of the pack. With his anterior paws he  seizes by the head the first dog who approaches him, and, as he is  more solidly balanced than his assailant, he holds the dog's nose  beneath the water as long as he can. Unless a second dog speedily  comes to the rescue the first is inevitably drowned. If a companion  arrives to free him, he is so disturbed by this unexpected bath that  he regains the bank as quickly as possible, and has no further desire  to attack this suffocating prey. A strong and courageous old male can  thus hold his own against twenty or thirty dogs, drowning some and  frightening others, and the hunter is obliged to intervene and put an  end to this energetic defence by a bullet.[39]       [39] J. Gould, _The Mammals of Australia_, London, 1845-60.    _Feint._--Many animals, when they cannot escape danger by flight, seek  safety by various feints. The device of feigning death is especially  widespread.    Many coleopterous insects and Spiders simulate death to perfection,  although it has been ascertained that they do not always adopt the  attitude which members of their species fall into when really dead.  But they remain perfectly motionless; neither leg nor antenna stirs.  McCook, who has devoted such loving study to Spiders, remarks in his  magnificent work, that the Orbweavers, especially, possess this habit.  \"One who touches an Orbweaver when hanging upon its web will often be  surprised to see it suddenly cast itself from the snare, or appear to  drop from it, as though shot off by some unseen force. Unless he  understands the nature of the creature he will be utterly at a loss to  know what has become of it. In truth it has simply dropped upon the  ground by a long thread which had been instantaneously emitted, and  had maintained the Aranead in its remarkable exit, so that its fall  was not only harmless, but its return to the web assured. The legs are  drawn up around the body, and to the inexperienced eye it has the  external semblance of death. In this condition it may be handled, it  may be turned over, it may be picked up, and, for a little while at  least, will retain its death-like appearance.\" Preyer, who has studied  this phenomenon in various animals, comes to the conclusion that it is  usually due to unconsciousness as the result of fright.[40] McCook is  unable to accept this theory of kataplexy, so far as Spiders are  concerned. \"I have frequently watched Spiders in this condition,\" he  observes, \"to determine the point in question, and their behaviour  always impressed me as being a genuine feigning of death, and  therefore entirely within their volition. The evidence is of such  indefinite nature that one can hardly venture to give it visible  expression, but my conviction is none the less decided. I may say,  however, that my observations indicate that the Spiders remained in  this condition as long as there seemed to be any threatened danger;  now and again the legs would be relaxed slightly, as though the  creature were about getting ready to resume its normal condition, but  at the slightest alarm withheld its purpose and relapsed into  rigidity. The slight unclasping of the legs, the faint quivering  indications of a purpose to come to life, and then the instant  suppression of the purpose, were so many evidences that the power of  volition was retained, and that the Aranead might have at once  recovered if it had been disposed to do so. Again, I think that I have  never noticed anything like that gradual emergence from the  kataplectic condition which one would naturally expect if the act were  not a voluntary one. On the contrary, the spider invariably recovered,  immediately sprang upon its legs, and hoisted itself to its snare, or  ran vigorously away among the grasses.\"[41]       [40] _Sammlung physiologischer Abhandlungen_, Zweite Reihe,          Erster Heft, 1878.       [41] H. C. McCook, _American Spiders_ (1889, etc.), vol. ii.          pp. 437-445. Romanes has an interesting discussion of the          habit of feigning death among animals, and cautiously          reaches the conclusion that it is very largely due, not to          kataplexy, but to intelligent action.--_Mental Evolution in          Animals_, pp. 303-316. And for some remarks on this subject          by Darwin in his Essay on Instinct, see the same volume, pp.          365, 366. Also Alix, _Esprit de nos Betes_, 1890, pp.          543-548.    Among fish, the Perch and the Sturgeon feign death; according to  Couch,[42] the Landrail, the Skylark, the Corncrake adopt the same  device. Among mammals, the best-known example is probably the Opossum.       [42] _Illustrations of Instinct_, 1847.    An Opossum (_Didelphys azarae_) of South America enters farms to  devastate the poultry yards. When he is discovered he runs away, but  is soon caught, and blows from sticks rain upon him. Seeing that he  cannot escape correction he seeks at least to save his life. Letting  his head fall and straightening his inert legs he receives the blows  without flinching. Often he is considered dead, and abandoned. The  cunning little beast, who desires nothing better, arises, shakes  himself, and rather bruised, but at all events alive, takes his way  back to the wood.    The Argentine Fox (_Canis azarae_), when caught in a trap or run down  by dogs, though it fights savagely at first, after a time drops down  and apparently dies. \"When in this condition of feigning death,\" Mr.  W. H. Hudson remarks, \"I am quite sure that the animal does not  altogether lose consciousness. It is exceedingly difficult to discover  any evidence of life in the opossum, but when one withdraws a little  way from the feigning fox, and watches him very attentively, a slight  opening of the eye may be detected; and, finally, when left to  himself, he does not recover and start up like an animal that has been  stunned, but slowly and cautiously raises his head first, and only  gets up when his foes are at a safe distance. Yet I have seen  _guachos_, who are very cruel to animals, practise the most barbarous  experiments on a captive fox without being able to rouse it into  exhibiting any sign of life. This has greatly puzzled me, since, if  death-feigning is simply a cunning habit, the animal could not suffer  itself to be mutilated without wincing. I can only believe that the  fox, though not insensible, as its behaviour on being left to itself  appears to prove, yet has its body thrown by extreme terror into that  benumbed condition which simulates death, and during which it is  unable to feel the"]]]
