[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36124"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 1, August, 1851 (#11)"],[1," the summer time with cattle and domestic       utensils; children and old men go to the solitary pasture       where echo dwells, where the national song springs forth       with the wild mountain flower! Dost thou see the procession?       Paint it if thou canst! The broad wooden cart, laden high       with chests and barrels, with jars and with crockery. The       bright copper kettle and the tin dish shine in the sun. The       old grandmother sits at the top of the load, and holds her       spinning wheel, which complete the pyramid. The father       drives the horse, the mother carries the youngest child on       her back, sewed up in a skin, and the procession moves on       step by step. The cattle are driven by the half-grown       children; they have stuck a birch branch between one of the       cows' horns, but she does not appear to be proud of her       finery; she goes the same quiet pace as the others, and       lashes the saucy flies with her tail. If the night becomes       cold on this solitary pasture, there is fuel enough; here       the tree falls of itself from old age, and lies and rots.         \"But take especial care of the fire--fear the fire-spirit in       the forest desert! He comes from the unextinguishable pile;       he comes from the thunder-cloud, riding on the blue       lightning's flame, which kindles the thick, dry moss of the       earth: trees and bushes are kindled; the flames run from       tree to tree, it is like a snow-storm of fire! the flames       leap to the tops of the trees. What a crackling and roaring,       as if it were the ocean in its course! The birds fly upward       in flocks, and fall down suffocated by the smoke; the       animals flee, or, encircled by the fire, are consumed in it!       Hear their cries and roars of agony! The howling of the wolf       and the bear, dost thou know it? A calm rainy day, and the       forest-plains themselves alone are able to confine the fiery       sea, and the burnt forest stands charred, with black trunks       and black stumps of trees, as we saw them here in the forest       by the broad high-road. On this road we continue to travel,       but it becomes worse and worse; it is, properly speaking, no       road at all, but it is about to become one. Large stones lie       half dug up, and we drive past them; large trees are cast       down, and obstruct our way, and therefore we must descend       from the carriage. The horses are taken out, and the       peasants help to lift and push the carriage forward over       ditches and opened paths. The sun now ceases to shine; some       few rain-drops fall, and now it is a steady rain. But how it       causes the birch to shed its fragrance! At a distance there       are huts erected of loose trunks of trees and fresh green       boughs, and in each there is a large fire burning. See where       the blue smoke curls through the green leafy roof; peasants       are within at work, hammering and forging; here they have       their meals. They are now laying a mine in order to blast a       rock, and the pine and birch emit a finer fragrance. It is       delightful in the forest.\"    So say we. It is delightful in the forest; not less so on the  torrent-river of Scandinavia:         \"Before Homer sang, there were heroes; but they are not       known, no poet celebrated their fame. It is just so with the       beauties of nature; they must be brought into notice by       words and delineations, be brought before the eyes of the       multitude; get a sort of world's patent for what they are.       The elvs of the North have rushed and whirled along for       thousands of years in unknown beauty. The world's great       high-road does not take this direction; no steam-packet       conveys the traveller comfortably along the streams of the       Dal-elvs; fall on fall makes sluices indispensable and       invaluable. Schubert is, as yet, the only stranger who has       written about the magnificence and southern beauty of       Dalecarlia, and spoken of its greatness.         \"Clear as the waves of the sea does the mighty elv stream in       endless windings through forest deserts and varying plains,       sometimes extending its deep bed, sometimes confining it,       reflecting the bending trees and the red-painted       block-houses of solitary towns, and sometimes rushing like a       cataract over immense blocks of rock.         \"Miles apart from one another, out of the ridge of mountains       between Sweden and Norway, come the east and west Dal-elvs,       which first become confluent and have one bed above Balstad.       They have taken up rivers and lakes in their waters. Do but       visit this place! here are pictorial riches to be found: the       most picturesque landscapes, dizzyingly grand, smilingly       pastoral, idyllic; one is drawn onward up to the very source       of the elv, the bubbling well above Finman's hut; one feels       a desire to follow every branch of the stream that the river       takes in.         \"The first mighty fall, Njupesker's Cataract, is seen by the       Norwegian frontier in Semasog. The mountain stream rushes       perpendicularly from the rock to a depth of seventy fathoms.         \"We pause in the dark forest, where the elv seems to collect       within itself nature's whole deep gravity. The stream rolls       its clear waters over a porphyry soil, where the mill-wheel       is driven, and the gigantic porphyry bowls and sarcophagi       are polished.         \"We follow the stream through Siljan's lake, where       superstition sees the water-sprite swim like the sea-horse,       with a mane of green seaweed; and where the aerial images       present visions of witchcraft in the warm summer day.         \"We sail on the stream from Siljan's lake under the weeping       willows of the parsonage, where the swans assemble in       flocks; we glide along slowly with horses and carriages on       the great ferry-boat, away over the rapid current under       Balstad's picturesque shore. Here the elv widens and rolls       its billows majestically in a woodland landscape, as large       and extended as if it were in North America.         \"We see the rushing, rapid stream under Avista's yellow clay       declivities; the yellow water falls, like fluid amber, in       picturesque cataracts before the copper works, where       rainbow-colored tongues of fire shoot themselves upwards,       and the hammer's blow on the copper-plates resound to the       monotonous, roaring rumble of the elv-fall.\"    And so on, past the famous fall down which the waters gush, ere they  lose themselves in the waters of the Baltic. One glimpse more ere they  reach their resting-place. We take them up as they are circling the  garden of a trim Swedish manor-house:         \"The garden itself was a piece of enchantment. There stood       three transplanted beech trees, and they throve well. The       sharp north wind had rounded off the tops of the wild       chestnut trees of the avenue in a singular manner; they       looked as if they had been under the gardener's shears.       Golden yellow oranges hung in the conservatory; the splendid       Southern exotics had to-day got the windows half open, so       that the artificial warmth met the fresh, warm, sunny air of       the Northern summer.         \"The branch of the Dal-elv which goes round the garden is       strewn with small islands, where beautiful hanging birches       and fir-trees grow in Scandinavian splendor. There are small       islands with green, silent groves; there are small islands       with rich grass, tall brakens, variegated bell flowers, and       cowslips. No Turkey carpet has fresher colors. The stream       between these islands and holmes is sometimes rapid, deep,       and clear; sometimes like a broad rivulet with silky green       rushes, water lilies, and brown feathered reeds; sometimes       it is a brook with a stony ground, and now it spreads itself       out in a large, still mill-dam.         \"Here is a landscape in midsummer for the games of the       river-sprites, and the dancers of the elves and fairies!       There, in the lustre of the full moon, the dryads can tell       their tales, the water-sprites seize the golden harp, and       believe that one can be blessed, at least for one single       night, like this.         \"On the other side of Ens Bruck is the main stream--the full       Dal-elv. Do you hear the monotonous rumble? It is not from       Elvkarleby Fall that it reaches hither; it is close by; it       is from Laa Foss in which lies Ash Island: the elv streams       and rushes over the leaping salmon.         \"Let us sit here, between the fragments of rock by the       shore, in the red evening sunlight, which sheds a golden       lustre on the waters of the Dal-elv.         \"Glorious river! But a few seconds' work hast thou to do in       the mills yonder, and thou rushest foaming on over       Elvkarleby's rocks, down into the deep bed of the river,       which leads thee to the Baltic--thy eternity.\"    We could fill half our number with passages just as beautiful; but  will leave the rest of the poet's landscapes till some American  publisher brings out the book. We must nevertheless quote one picture  of a different kind. \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin;\"  and the sorrows of the palace and the cottage alike find their level  and their rest in the grave. The \"Mute Book\" speaks with a moving  eloquence to those who can read it aright:         \"By the high-road into the forest there stood a solitary       farm-house. One way lay right through the farm-yard; the sun       shone; all the windows were open; there was life and bustle       within, but in the yard, in an arbor of flowering lilacs,       there stood an open coffin. The corpse had been placed out       here, and it was to be buried that forenoon. No one stood       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36131"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 3, June, 1851 (#11)"],[1,"upation; whilst in their purely  clerical capacity they have felt the necessity of proceeding with more  cautious circumspection, improving rather than creating opportunities,  relying less upon formal preaching than on familiar discourses, and  trusting more to the intimate exhortation of a few than to the effect  of popular addresses to indiscriminate assemblies.'         \"'The first embryo instruction is communicated by them in       free village schools, scattered everywhere throughout the       district, in which the children of the Tamils are taught in       their own tongue the simplest elements of knowledge, and the       earliest processes of education--to read from translations       of the Christian Scriptures, and to write their own       language, first by tracing the letters on the sand, and       eventually by inscribing them with an iron style upon the       prepared leaves of the _Palmyra palm_. It will afford an       idea of the extent and perseverance with which education has       been pursued in these primitive institutions, that, in the       free schools of the Americans alone, 4,000 pupils, of whom       one-fourth are females, are daily receiving instruction, and       upwards of 90,000 children have been taught in them since       their commencement, a proportion equal to one-half the       present population of the peninsula.'\"    \"It was soon seen that, in addition to these primary schools, the  establishment of boarding schools was extremely desirable, for the  purpose of separating the pupils from the influence of idolatry. The  attempt was made, but proved to be attended with difficulties which  would have appeared to many insurmountable. In the first place, the  natives were suspicious, not conceiving that strangers could undertake  such toil, trouble, and expense, without an interested object. The  more positive difficulty was connected with caste, with the reluctance  of parents to permit their children to associate with those of a lower  rank.         \"'This the missionaries overcame, not so much by inveighing       against the absurdity of such distinctions as by practically       ignoring them, except wherever expediency or necessity       required their recognition. In all other cases where the       customs and prejudices of the Tamils were harmless in       themselves, or productive of no inconvenience to others,       they were in no way contravened or prohibited; but as       intelligence increased, and the minds of the pupils became       expanded, the most distinctive and objectionable of them       were voluntarily and almost imperceptibly abandoned.         \"'When the boarders were first admitted to one of the       American schools at Batticotta, a cook-house was obliged to       be erected for them on the adjoining premises of a heathen,       as they would not eat under the roof of a Christian; but       after a twelvemonth's perseverance, the inconvenience       overcame the objection, and they removed to the refectory of       the institution. But here a fresh difficulty was to be       encountered; some of the high caste youths made an objection       to use the same wells which had been common to the whole       establishment; and it was agreed to meet their wishes by       permitting them to clear out one in particular, to be       reserved exclusively for themselves. They worked incessantly       for a day, but finding it hopeless to draw it perfectly dry,       they resolved to accommodate the difficulty, on the       principle, that having drawn off as much water as the well       contained when they began, the remainder must be       sufficiently pure for all ordinary uses.'\"    \"In addition to these primary and boarding-schools, the American  Mission, in 1830, established schools for teaching English, and for  elementary instruction of a more advanced description. These were all  under a discipline avowedly Christian, yet the missionaries found that  they were able not only to enforce the fee demanded, but to maintain  their regulations without loss of numbers.         \"'And it is a fact,' says Sir Emerson Tennent, 'suggestive       of curious speculation as to the genius and character of       this anomalous people, that in a heathen school recently       established by Brahmans in the vicinity of Jaffna, the       Hindoo Community actually compelled those who conducted it       to introduce the reading of the Bible as an indispensable       portion of the ordinary course of instruction.'\"    \"This does not seem so strange to us. The shrewd Tamils, as we collect  from other observations in the work before us, perceived how the  Bible-reading children had improved in demeanor, conduct, and success  in life. For these same reasons, and possibly in some cases from a  deeper feeling never yet avowed, the Roman Catholic peasantry of  Ireland, before the introduction of the National System of Education,  and previously to, and, in many cases, long after, the expressed  hostility of their priesthood, anxiously sent their children to the  schools of the Kildare-place and the Hibernian Bible Societies.    \"The other missionaries, we need hardly say, were as active as the  Americans. After some years of further experience, they all felt the  necessity of founding educational institutions of a still more  advanced description for the instruction of the natives in their own  language. It became plain to them that, from physical as well as moral  causes, the conversion of the natives could be only hoped for through  the medium of their well-taught and well-trained countrymen. The  niceties of the language and their modes of thought presented  difficulties of a most serious character to others; the very terms of  the ordinary address of a missionary suggested ideas altogether  different from what he intended. Thus, when GOD is spoken of, they  probably understand one of their own deities who yields to every vile  indulgence; by SIN, they mean ceremonial defilement, or evil committed  in a former birth, for which they are not accountable; _hell_ with  them is only a place of temporary punishment; and _heaven_ nothing  more than absorption, or the loss of individuality. Under these  impressions each of the missionary bodies at Jaffna formed for  themselves a collegiate institution, in which the best scholars from  their other schools were admitted to a still more advanced course, and  taught the sciences of Europe. That of the Church Missionary Society  of England was established at Nellore, but subsequently removed to  Chundically; the Wesleyans commenced theirs in the great square of  Jaffna; and that of the Americans was founded at Batticotta, in the  midst of a cultivated country, within sight of the sea, and at a very  few miles distant from the fort.\"         \"'It was opened in 1823, with about fifty students chosen       from the most successful pupils of all the schools in the       province; and the course of education is so comprehensive as       to extend over a period of eight years of study. With a       special regard to the future usefulness of its alumni in the       conflict with the errors of the Brahmanical system, the       curriculum embraces all the ordinary branches of historical       and classical learning, and all the higher departments of       mathematical and physical science, combined with the most       intricate familiarization with the great principles and       evidences of the Christian religion.         \"'The number which the building can accommodate is limited,       for the present, to one hundred, who reside within its       walls, and take their food in one common hall, sitting to       eat after the custom of the natives. For some years the       students were boarded and clothed at the expense of the       mission; but such is now the eagerness for instruction that       there are a multitude of competitors for every casual       vacancy; and the cost of their maintenance during the whole       period of pupilage is willingly paid in advance, in order to       secure the privilege of admission.         \"'Nearly six hundred students have been under instruction       from time to time since the commencement of the American       Seminary at Batticotta, and of these upwards of four hundred       have completed the established course of education. More       than one-half have made an open profession of Christianity,       and all have been familiarized with its doctrines, and more       or less imbued with its spirit. The majority are now filling       situations of credit and responsibility throughout the       various districts of Ceylon; numbers are employed under the       missionaries themselves, as teachers and catechists, and as       preachers and superintendents of schools; many have       migrated, in similar capacities, to be attached to Christian       missions on the continent of India; others have lent their       assistance to the missions of the Wesleyans and the Church       of England in Ceylon; and amongst those who have attached       themselves to secular occupations, I can bear testimony to       the abilities, the qualifications, and integrity, of the       many students of Jaffna, who have accepted employment in       various offices under the Government of the colony.'\"    \"Another of the instruments of conversion adopted by these  indefatigable men is _the press_. They were long obliged to have their  tracts written out on _olahs_, or strips of the Palmyra leaf, which,  when the missionary took for distribution, were strung round the neck  of his horse. The printing establishment of the American Mission has  for many years given constant employment to upwards of eighty Tamil  workmen. Their publications are either religious or educational; and  one of their ulterior objects is to supersede the degraded legends  still in circulation.
