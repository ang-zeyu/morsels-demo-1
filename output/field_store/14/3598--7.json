Very little of the sweat that Jason wiped from his sopping face was  caused by the heat in the room.    \"I'm ... sorry I lost my temper,\" Kerk said, dropping heavily into his  chair. \"Doesn't usually happen. Been working hard lately, must have got  my temper on edge.\" He made no mention of what Jason had said.    \"Happens to all of us,\" Jason told him. \"I won't begin to describe the  condition my nerves were in when I hit this planet. I'm finally forced  to admit that everything you said about Pyrrus is true. It is the most  deadly spot in the system. And only native-born Pyrrans could possibly  survive here. I can manage to fumble along a bit after my training, but  I know I would never stand a chance on my own. You probably know I have  an eight-year-old as a bodyguard. Gives a good idea of my real status  here.\"    Anger suppressed, Kerk was back in control of himself now. His eyes  narrowed in thought. \"Surprises me to hear you say that. Never thought I  would hear you admit that anyone could be better than you at anything.  Isn't that why you came here? To prove that you were as good as any  native-born Pyrran?\"    \"Score one for your side,\" Jason admitted. \"I didn't think it showed  that much. And I'm glad to see your mind isn't as muscle-bound as your  body. Yes, I'll admit that was probably my main reason for coming, that  and curiosity.\"    Kerk was following his own train of thoughts, and puzzled where they  were leading him. \"You came here to prove that you were as good as any  native-born Pyrran. Yet now you admit that any eight-year-old can  outdraw you. That just doesn't stack up with what I know about you. If  you give with one hand, you must be taking back with the other. In what  way do you still feel your natural superiority?\"    Jason thought a long time before answering.    \"I'll tell you,\" he finally said. \"But don't snap my neck for it. I'm  gambling that your civilized mind can control your reflexes. Because I  have to talk about things that are strictly taboo on Pyrrus.    \"In your people's eyes I'm a weakling because I come from off-world.  Realize though, that this is also my strength. I can see things that are  hidden from you by long association. You know, the old business of not  being able to see the forest for the trees in the way.\" Kerk nodded  agreement and Jason went on.    \"To continue the analogy further, I landed from an airship, and at  first all I _could_ see was the forest. To me certain facts are  obvious. I think that you people know them too, only you keep your  thoughts carefully repressed. They are hidden thoughts that are  completely taboo. I am going to say one of them out loud now and hope  you can control yourself well enough to not kill me.\"    Kerk's great hands tightened on the arms of his chair, the only sign  that he had heard. Jason talked quietly, as smoothly and easily as a  lancet probing into a brain.    \"Human beings are losing the war on Pyrrus. There is no chance they can  win. They could leave for another planet, but that wouldn't be victory.  Yet, if they stay and continue this war, they only prolong a  particularly bloody form of racial suicide. With each generation the  population drops. Until eventually the planet will win.\"    One arm of Kerk's plastic and steel chair tore loose under the crushing  grasp of his fingers. He didn't notice it. The rest of his body was  rock-still and his eyes fixed on Jason.    Looking away from the fractured chair, Jason sought for the right words.    \"This is not a real war, but a disastrous treating of symptoms. Like  cutting off cancerous fingers one by one. The only result can be  ultimate death. None of you seem to realize that. All you see are the  trees. It has never occurred to you that you could treat the _causes_ of  this war and end it forever.\"    Kerk dropped the arm of the chair clattering to the floor. He sat up,  astonished. \"What the devil do you mean? You sound like a grubber.\"    Jason didn't ask what a grubber was--but he filed the name.    \"Call me a Pyrran by adoption. I want this planet to survive as much as  you do. I think this war can be ended by finding the _causes_--and  changing them, whatever they are.\"    \"You're talking nonsense,\" Kerk said. \"This is just an alien world that  must be battled. The causes are self-obvious facts of existence.\"    \"No, they're not,\" Jason insisted. \"Consider for a second. When you are  away for any length of time from this planet, you must take a refresher  course. To see how things have changed for the worse while you were  gone. Well, that's a linear progression. If things get worse when you  extend into the future, then they have to get better if you extend into  the past. It is also good theory--though I don't know if the facts will  bear me out--to say that if you extend it far enough into the past you  will reach a time when mankind and Pyrrus were not at war with each  other.\"    Kerk was beyond speech now, only capable of sitting and listening while  Jason drove home the blows of inescapable logic.    \"There is evidence to support this theory. Even you will admit that I,  if I am no match for Pyrran life, am surely well versed in it. And all  Pyrran flora and fauna I've seen have one thing in common. They're not  functional. _None_ of their immense armory of weapons is used against  each other. Their toxins don't seem to operate against Pyrran life. They  are good only for dispensing death to Homo sapiens. And _that_ is a  physical impossibility. In the three hundred years that men have been on  this planet, the life forms couldn't have naturally adapted in this  manner.\"    \"But they _have_ done it!\" Kerk bellowed.    \"You are so right,\" Jason told him calmly. \"And if they have done it  there must be some agency at work. Operating how--I have no idea. But  something has caused the life on Pyrrus to declare war, and I'd like to  find out what that something is. What was the dominant life form here  when your ancestors landed?\"    [Illustration]    \"I'm sure I wouldn't know,\" Kerk said. \"You're not suggesting, are you,  that there are sentient beings on Pyrrus other than those of human  descent? Creatures who are organizing the planet to battle us?\"    \"I'm not suggesting it--you are. That means you're getting the idea. I  have no idea what caused this change, but I would sure like to find out.  Then see if it can be changed back. Nothing promised, of course. You'll  agree, though, that it is worth investigating.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Fist smacking into his palm, his heavy footsteps shaking the building,  Kerk paced back and forth the length of the room. He was at war with  himself. New ideas fought old beliefs. It was so sudden--and so hard not  to believe.    Without asking permission Jason helped himself to some chilled water  from the bottle, and sank back into the chair, exhausted. Something  whizzed in through the open window, tearing a hole in the protective  screen. Kerk blasted it without changing stride, without even knowing he  had done it.    The decision didn't take long. Geared to swift activity, the big Pyrran  found it impossible not to decide quickly. The pacing stopped and a  finger stabbed at Jason.    \"I don't say you have convinced me, but I find it impossible to find a  ready answer to your arguments. So until I do, we will have to operate  as if they are true. Now what do you plan to do, what _can_ you do?\"    Jason ticked the points off on his fingers. \"One, I'll need a place to  live and work that is well protected. So instead of spending my energies  on just remaining alive I can devote some study to this project. Two, I  want someone to help me--and act as a bodyguard at the same time. And  someone, please, with a little more scope of interest than my present  watchdog. I would suggest Meta for the job.\"    \"Meta?\" Kerk was surprised. \"She is a space pilot and defense-screen  operator, what good could she possibly be on a project like this?\"    \"The most good possible. She has had experience on other worlds and can  shift her point of view--at least a bit. And she must know as much about  this planet as any other educated adult and can answer any questions I  ask.\" Jason smiled. \"In addition to which she is an attractive girl,  whose company I enjoy.\"    Kerk grunted. \"I was wondering if you would get around to mentioning  that last reason. The others make sense though, so I'm not going to  argue. I'll round up a replacement for her and have Meta sent here.  There are plenty of sealed buildings you can use.\"    After talking to one of the assistants from the outer office, Kerk made  some calls on the screen. The correct orders were quickly issued. Jason  watched it all with interest.    \"Pardon me for asking,\" he finally said. \"But are you the dictator of  this planet? You just snap your fingers and they all jump.\"    \"I suppose it looks that way,\" Kerk admitted. \"But that is just an  illusion. No one is in complete charge on Pyrrus, neither is there  anything resembling a democratic system. After all, our total population  is about the size of an army division. Everyone does the job they are  best qualified for. Various activities are separated into departments  with the most qualified person in charge. I run Co-ordination and  Supply, which is about the loosest category. We fill in the gaps between  departments and handle procuring from off-planet.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Meta came in then and talked to Kerk. She completely ignored Jason's  presence. \"I was relieved and sent here,\" she said. \"What is it? Change  in flight schedule?\"    \"You might call it that,\" Kerk said. \"As of now you are dismissed from  all your old assignments and assigned to a new department: Investigation  and Research. That tired-looking fellow there is your department head.\"    \"A sense of humor,\" Jason said. \"The only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#11)"],[1," longer the childish type. None the  less, in the boy also certain secondary sexual characters begin to  develop comparatively early. Thus, in the second period of childhood,  the boy's shoulders often become wider, his muscles stronger, than those  of the girl. Since at the same period there occurs in girls the greater  deposit of fat previously described, marked differences result in the  external contours of the respective bodies. The boy's body is therefore  much more angular and knobby, far less softly rounded, than that of the  girl. Towards the end of the second period of childhood, an additional  sexual character makes its appearance in the male sex, namely, the voice  breaks. The chief remaining differences, the growth of the beard and  the pubic hair, and the development of the characteristically masculine  larynx, usually manifest themselves after the close of the second period  of childhood--that is to say, during the period of youth.    As children become physically differentiated in respect of sex, so also  does a mental differentiation ensue. Authorities are not agreed as to  whether mental sexual differentiation exists in the very earliest years  of life. Many assume its existence, and profess to have observed sexual  differences even in the movements of quite small children. On the other  hand, it is urged that the alleged differences are made up out of  chance, auto-suggestion on the part of the observer, and the results of  education. There is, however, general agreement as to the fact that  during the second period of childhood mental differences become apparent  between the sexes. Such differences are observed in the matter of  occupation, of games, of movements, and numerous other details. Since  man is to play the active part in life, boys rejoice especially in rough  outdoor games. Girls, on the other hand, prefer such games as correspond  to their future occupations. Hence their inclination to mother smaller  children, and to play with dolls. Watch how a little girl takes care of  her doll, washes it, dresses and undresses it. When only six or seven  years of age, she is often an excellent nurse. As Padberg[15] pictures  her, she sits at the bedside of her sick brother or sister, resembling  as she does so an angel in human form. Her need to occupy herself in  such activities is often so great, that she pretends that her doll is  ill. Chamisso, in his poem _Das kleine Maedchen und die Puppe_ (_The  Little Girl and her Doll_), describes this relationship between the  child and her doll, one whose nature is fully understood only by a  mother:--      \"Wie Du mit den kleinen Kindern,     Will ich alles mit ihr tun,     Und sie soll in ihrer Wiege     Neben meinem Bette ruhn.     Schlaeft sie, werd' ich von ihr traeumen,     Schreit sie auf, erwach' ich gleich,--     Mein himmlisch gute Mutter,     O, wie bin ich dock so reich!\"      \"All you do for your children,     For my Doll I do instead,     And in her little cradle     She lies beside my bed.     When she sleeps, I dream about her,     When she cries, I wake up too.     My own, dear, darling Mother,     I'm just as rich as you!\"    Once I saw a little girl of seven running up and down the room, carrying  all kinds of things as fast as she could to her doll. When I asked her  what was the matter, she told me that her doll had the measles, and she  was taking care of her. In all kinds of ways, we see the little girl  occupying herself in the activities and inclinations of her future  existence. She practises housework; she has a little kitchen, in which  she cooks for herself and her doll. She is fond of needlework. The care  of her own person, and more especially its adornment, are not forgotten.  I remember seeing a girl of three who kept on interrupting her elders'  conversation by crying out \"New clothes!\" and would not keep quiet until  these latter had been duly admired. The love of self-adornment is almost  peculiar to female children; boys, on the other hand, prefer rough  outdoor games, in which their muscles are actively employed,  robber-games, soldier-games, and the like. And whereas, in early  childhood, both sexes are fond of very noisy games, the fondness for  these disappears earlier in girls than in boys.    Differences between the sexes have been established also by means of  experimental psychology, based upon the examination of a very large  number of instances. Although it must be admitted that some of the  acquirements of this school are still open to dispute, the data of these  collective investigations must not be ignored. Berthold Hartmann has  studied the childish circle of thought, by means of a series of  experiments which are commonly spoken of as the Annaberg experiments.  Schoolboys to the number of 660 and schoolgirls to the number of 652, at  ages between 5-3/4 and 6-3/4 years, were subjected to examination. It  was very remarkable to see how in respect of certain ideas, such as  those of the triangle, cube, and circle, the girls greatly excelled the  boys; whereas in respect of animals, minerals and social ideas, the boys  were better informed than the girls. Characteristic of the differences  between the sexes, according to Meumann,[16] from whom I take these  details, and some of those that follow, is the fact that the idea of  \"marriage\" was known to only 70 boys, as compared to 227 girls; whilst  the idea of \"infant baptism\" was known to 180 boys as compared to 220  girls. The idea of \"pleasure\" was also much better understood by girls  than by boys. Examination of the memory has also established the  existence of differences between the sexes in childhood. In boys the  memory for objects appears to be at first the best developed; to this  succeeds the memory for words with a visual content: in the case of  girls, the reverse of this was observed. In respect of numerous details,  however, the authorities conflict. According to Lobsien, boys have a  better memory for numbers, words, and sounds. The same investigator  informs us that in girls the visual memory is distinctly better than it  is in boys, this indicating that girls' memory for objects is also  better; but Netschajeff, on the other hand, maintains that boys have a  better memory for objects perceptible by the senses. It is interesting  to note that certain variations have been shown to exist at different  ages. During the first years of school-life, boys' memories are in  general better than girls', this advantage persisting up to the age of  ten; from this time onwards until the end of the years spent in primary  schools, girls excel boys in the matter of memory, but especially at  ages of eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen. Later than this, the  boys become equal to the girls, and still later surpass them. Very  striking is the fact, one upon which a very large number of  investigators are agreed, that girls have a superior knowledge of  colours. Experimental investigations made by means of Holmgren's test  have shown that the superiority of girls in this respect is remarkable,  and these experiments are confirmed by other lines of study.    There are additional psychological data relating to the differences  between the sexes in childhood. I may recall Stern's investigations  concerning the psychology of evidence, which showed that girls were much  more inaccurate than boys. I may also refer, on the other hand, in  relation to sexual differentiation, to the experiences obtained by Hans  Gross by means of observations on practical life, although his results  are not entirely free from certain sources of fallacy, and moreover have  been disputed by other observers as not generally applicable. Hans  Gross, however, found a notable difference between boys and girls, of  which I shall later give a detailed description. Here, I shall merely  quote the comprehensive summary given in his _Criminal Psychology_: \"My  results show that the boy who has passed his first years of childhood  is, if well trained, the best observer and witness that can possibly be  found, because he watches with interest all that goes on around him,  stores it impartially in his memory, and reproduces it faithfully;  whereas the girl of like age is often an untrustworthy, and even a  dangerous witness. She is inevitably this when, after traversing the  stages of talent, ardour, reverie, romanticism, and enthusiasm, she has  passed into a condition of _Weltschmerz_, tinged with _tedium vitae_.  This emotional mental atmosphere is entered at an earlier age than is  commonly imagined; and when such a girl's own personal interests are in  any way affected by the occurrences under examination, we are never  secure from gross exaggeration and misstatement. Petty larceny becomes  robbery with violence; a trifling incivility, a serious assault; a  harmless pleasantry, an interesting proposal for elopement; and the  foolish prattle of children becomes a dangerous conspiracy.\"    I shall subsequently discuss in detail a psychical difference which is  the most important of all those connected with the sexual life, namely,  the direction of the sexual impulse, which attracts the man to the  woman, and the woman to the man. We shall see to what a considerable  degree this phenomenon manifests itself even in childhood.    It has been widely assumed that these psychical differences between the  sexes result from education, and are not inborn. To avoid  misunderstanding, we must, in our consideration of this question of  education, distinguish between two distinct classes of phenomena, those  which are individual and those which have existed for a number of  generations. The sexually differentiated qualities in any individual may  be regarded as inborn, and yet we may admit that the differentiation was  originally the result of education, if we suppose that in earlier  generations in either sex certain qualities were developed, and that  gradually, by monosexual inheritance, the "]]]
