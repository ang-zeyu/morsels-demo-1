The longest roads must either make their through  rates lower than local rates between distant points, or lose much of  their through business. They cannot afford to do the latter and the  statutory laws may forbid the former. As a result the laws most likely  are evaded, or else openly disobeyed.[20]    The difficulties in adjusting the matter of the long and the short  haul, as has been shown, have caused the formation of pools and various  other traffic associations, the object of which has been to prevent  rate-wars. To this extent they resulted in positive good, for a  rate-war in the end is apt to be as hurtful to the community as to the  railway company. The attempt to settle such questions has also resulted  in a great deal of legislation. Some of this has been wise and good; but  not a little has been hurtful both to the railroads and to the  community. The general result is seen in the great combination of  competing lines and, more recently, of competing systems.    =Passenger Service.=--Passenger traffic is more easily managed than the  movement of freight. For the greater part the rates are fixed by law. On  a few eastern roads local rates are two cents per mile; in the main,  however, a three-cent rate prevails, except that in sparsely peopled  regions the rates are four and five cents per mile. On many roads  1,000-mile books are sold at the rate of twenty dollars; on some the  rate is twenty-five dollars per book.    Long-distance rates involving passage over several roads are somewhat  less than the local rates. These rates are determined by joint  passenger-tariff associations. Each individual road fixes its own  excursion and commutation rates; one or another of the joint passenger  associations determines the rates where several roads divide the  traffic. The latter are usually one, or one and one-third fares for the  round trip.    Except on a few local roads in densely peopled regions the passenger  service is much less remunerative than freight business, and not a few  railways would abolish passenger trains altogether were they permitted  to do so. Rate-cutting between competing roads has not been common since  the existence of joint passenger associations. It is sometimes done  secretly, however, through the use of ticket-brokers, or \"scalpers,\" who  are employed to sell tickets at less than the usual rate; it is also  done by the illicit use of tickets authorized for given purposes, such  as \"editors',\" \"clergymen's,\" and \"advertising\" transportation.    In many instances, where several roads have the same terminal points, it  is customary for the road or roads having the quickest service to allow  a lower rate to the others. Thus, of the seven or eight roads between  New York and Chicago, the two best equipped roads charge a fare of  twenty dollars on their ordinary, and a higher rate on their limited,  trains. Because of slower time the other roads charge a sum less by two  or three dollars for the same service. This cut in the rate is called a  \"differential.\"    =Railway Mileage.=--The railways of the world in 1900 had an aggregate of  nearly four hundred and eighty thousand miles distributed as follows:      North America                   216,000    Europe                          173,000    Asia                             36,000    South America and West Indies    28,000    Australasia                      15,000    Africa                           12,000    In western Europe and the eastern United States there is an average of  one mile of railway to each six or eight square miles of area. In these  countries railway construction has reached probably its highest  development, and the proportion seems to represent the mileage necessary  for the commercial interests of the people.    The railways of the United States aggregate 193,000 miles--nearly  one-half the total mileage of the world. Over this enormous trackage  38,000 locomotives and 1,400,000 coaches and cars carry yearly  600,000,000 passengers and 1,000,000,000 tons of freight. They represent  an outlay of about $5,000,000,000. Owing to the absence of the  international problems that have greatly interfered with the  organization of European railways, the roads of the United States have  developed \"trunk-system\" features to a higher degree than is found  elsewhere.    In the United States and Canada the farms of the great central plain,  together with the coal-mines, are the great centres of production, while  the seaports of the two coasts form great centres of distribution. Most  of the trunk lines, therefore, extend east and west; of the north and  south lines only two are important. The reason for the east-west  direction of the great trunk lines is obvious; the great markets of  North America, Europe, and Asia lie respectively to the east and the  west.    [Illustration: THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RAILWAYS OF THE UNITED STATES  THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE LAND]    =Railway Ownership.=--The ownership of railways is vested either in  national governments or else in corporate companies; in only a few  instances are roads held individually by private owners, and these are  mainly lumber or plantation roads. Thus, the railways of Prussia are  owned by the state; most of those of the smaller German states are owned  either by the state or by the empire; still others are owned by  corporate companies and managed by the imperial government. In their  management military use is considered as first in importance.    In France governmental ownership and management have been less  successful. Plans for an elaborate system of state railways failed, and  the state now owns and operates only 1,700 miles, mainly, in the  southwest. Belgium controls and operates all her lines, but as the  latter are short and the area of the state small, there are no  difficulties in the way of excellent management. In Great Britain all  the railways are owned and controlled by corporate companies. The great  transcontinental line of the Russian Empire was built by the government,  but the latter does not own it.    In the United States the railways are now owned by corporate companies.  Some of the western roads were built by Government subsidies;[21] other  roads were built by the aid of States, counties, or cities, which  afterward sold them to corporate companies. The first transcontinental  railways required Government assistance, and could not have been built  without it; nowadays, however, corporate companies find no difficulty in  providing the capital for any railway that is needed.    Inasmuch as the railway is a positive necessity, upon whose existence  depends the transportation of the food daily required in the great  centres of population, the charter of the railway gives the company  extraordinary powers. Most steam railway companies are permitted by the  State to exercise the power of _eminent domain_--that is, they may seize  and hold the land on which to locate their tracks and buildings, if it  cannot be acquired by the consent of the owners; they may also seize  coal and other materials consigned to them for shipment if such  materials are necessary to operate their lines.    Therefore, in consideration of the unusual powers possessed by the  companies, the various States reserve the right to regulate the freight  and passenger tariffs. They may also compel the companies to afford  equal facilities to all patrons, and take the measures necessary to  prevent discrimination.    The control of the railways by the government may be absolute, as in the  German state of Prussia; or it may consist of a general supervision, as  in the case of the Canadian railways. In almost every European state  there is a director or else a commission to act as a representative  between the railways and the people. In the United States the various  States have each a railway commission, while the general Government is  represented by the Interstate Commerce Commission.    =Electric Railways.=--The use of electricity as a motive power has not  only revolutionized suburban traffic but it has become a great factor in  rural transportation as well. The speed of the horse-car rarely exceeded  five or six miles per hour, while that of the electric car is about ten  miles per hour in city streets and about twice as great over rural  roads. As a result, the suburban limits of the large centres of  population have greatly extended, and the population of the outlying  districts has been increased from four to ten fold.    [Illustration: ELECTRIC RAILWAY--ROCKY MOUNTAINS]    [Illustration: ELECTRIC FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE--ERIE RAILROAD]    From some of the larger cities the electric roads reach out to  distances of one hundred miles or more and have become the carriers of  perishable freight, such as fruit and dairy products. These are not only  delivered just as promptly as though they were sent over the steam  roads, but the delivery is more frequent. Indeed, the marvellous success  of the electric interurban railway is due mainly to the frequency of its  service.    =Public Roads and Highways.=--Carriages propelled by steam, electric, and  gasoline motors have become an important factor in the delivery of goods  in nearly every city of Europe and America. They are not only speedier  than the horse and wagon, but their keeping costs less. They are  economical only on good roads. The bicycle, no longer a plaything,  exerted a very decided effect on transportation when the \"pneumatic\" or  inflated rubber tire came into use. Through the bicycle came the demand  for good roads; and several thousand miles of the best surfaced roads  are built in the United States each year.    The ordinary highways or roads, the paved streets of the large cities  excepted, are popularly known either as \"dirt\" roads or \"macadamized\"  roads, the latter name being applied to about every sort of graded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24902"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 4, March, 1851 (#11)"],[1,"complete grammar of the Coptic language has been brought out at  Berlin, by Professor SCHWARTZE.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ITALIAN REVOLUTION.--Books relating to the late revolution in Italy  and the events which preceded it are now published in that country in  considerable numbers. One by Farini, _Lo Stato Romano dall' anno 1815  all' anno 1850_, not yet completed, only two volumes having been  published, will be found valuable to the future historian. Its author is  a constitutionalist, and treats the reign of Pius IX. strictly from that  stand-point. His book must therefore be read with discretion. With the  third volume, which will soon appear, will be issued a second edition of  the first two volumes. Marquis F. A. Gualtiero of Orvieto has just  brought out at Florence the first volume of a large work, _Gli Ultimenti  Rivolgimenti Italiani, Memorie Storiche con Documenti Inediti_. This is  excellent in respect to the pre-revolutionary events, giving a great  variety of information as to persons as well as circumstances, in  considerable detail. It is to be followed by an account of the  revolution itself, treated of course in the same manner. It hardly need  be said that the Marquis must fail to do justice to Mazzini and the  republicans. An elaborate and able article reviewing the whole question  has lately appeared in the _Rivista Italiana_, from the pen of Signor  Berti. One of the best books yet produced on the revolutionary side is  General Pepe's _Guerres d'Italie_.           *       *       *       *       *    We noticed last month the anniversary meeting of the Archaeological  Institute at Rome. The same society has just published its Annals, or  Annual Memoirs, for 1850, a volume of great value and interest. It  contains Lanza's report on the excavations at Salona, continued down to  the year 1848. An essay is contributed by Canina upon the three temples  of Pietas, Spes, and Juno Sospita, on whose ruins is built the church of  San Nicola _in carcere_, new remains of the temples having been  discovered in 1848. The statue of Apoxyomenos, found a year since at  Trastavere, as well as the series of Amazons _in relievo_ now in the  British Museum, which Emil Braun takes to be relics of the famous  Mausoleum, are treated at length. A little triangular candelabra, found  in the Baths of Titus, is made interesting from the relation of the  figures upon it to the worship of Apollo. The series of Etruscan  frescoes has been greatly enriched by the pictures in two tombs, one of  which was discovered in 1846 by A. Francois, while the other was then  for the first time copied and rescued from entire oblivion. These  pictures, which, like most monumental works, represent funeral feasts  and games, according to Braun, are valuable for a mass of details  relating to antique athletic art, which were before unknown. A Pompeiian  fresco, representing the twelve gods, hitherto little esteemed, is made  the subject of a profound investigation by E. Gerhard. Among the essays  on vases, a long one by Welcker deserves especial mention. It discusses  all the known representations of the Death of Troilus. The sphere of  numismatics is filled by a long essay by Cavedoni on the Roman coins of  the time of Augustus. There are also many other articles of no less  interest to scholars, antiquaries, and artists.           *       *       *       *       *    M. ANTOINE D'ABBADIE received not long ago from President Bonaparte, the  decoration of the Legion of Honor, for alleged geographical discoveries  in Africa. An \"Inquiry\" into M. Abbadie's journey has just appeared in  London, from the hand of Dr. Charles T. Beke, and it is not impossible  that the traveller will turn out a Damburger or a Hunter. Dr. Beke is an  Englishman; D'Abbadie, an Irishman by birth, but a Frenchman by name,  education and allegiance. The latter professes to have been the first  European who ever put foot in the African Kingdom of Kaffa; the former  gives reasons for doubting his statements entirely, and does not believe  the Frenchman has even been in the country he describes at all.           *       *       *       *       *    The great oriental scholar Monsignore MOLSA has been appointed to the  office of Chief Guardian of the Vatican Library, in the room of M.

JAMES BAILEY, and the blasphemous rant and fustian and crude  speculation which make up his poem of \"Festus,\" which has had such  extraordinary popularity among our transcendentalists, and which  Shakspeare Hudson so excellently well reviewed in the _Whig Review_ a  year or two ago, we think a correspondent of _The Tribune_ speaks justly  in the following extract from a letter dated at Nottingham, in England:    \"Apropos of Nottingham, I have seen Bailey, the author of 'Festus.' His  father is proprietor of the _Nottingham Mercury_, and the editorial  department rests with him. He is a heavy, thick set sort of man; of a  stature below the middle size; complexion dark; and, in years about  eight and thirty. His physiognomy would be clownish in expression, if  his eyes did not redeem his other features. He spoke of 'Festus,' and of  its fame in America, of which he seemed very proud. In England, it has  only reached the third edition, while eight or nine have been published  in the States. You know my opinion of the work. It is as far from being  a great poem as the Thames, compared with the Mississippi or the Ohio,  is from being a great river. Anxiously, anxiously have I sought one  striking original idea in the whole poem (appalling in its length), but  to no purpose. The transcendental literature of Germany absorbs all  that, at first glance, arrests the attention. Without learning,  imagination, or the attraction of a beautiful metre (like that of  Tennyson's 'Princess'), I am at a loss to know what has given this poem  its notoriety. Not its daring speculation, surely, for it is but a timid  compromise between Orthodoxy and Universalism.\"           *       *       *       *       *    H. F. CLINTON has published in London the concluding volume of his  _Fasti Romani_: the civil and literary chronology of Rome and  Constantinople from the death of Augustus to the death of Heraclius. The  first volume, containing the chronological tables, was published in  1845, and formed a continuation of the _Fasti Hellenici_, by the same  author. It came down to the death of Justin II., A. D. 578. The present  volume continues the tables from the latter date to the death of  Heraclius, A. D. 641; but the greater part of it consists of a series of  learned dissertations on various points connected with the civil and  literary history of the Roman and Byzantine empires.           *       *       *       *       *    CAPTAIN J.
