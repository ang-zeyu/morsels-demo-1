Frau Emilie will show you a calling-card, and answer as follows: \"How  can one associate with such a person? Look at her card--why has she not  had it printed in the proper way, with her maiden name in the usual  place? Because it would not look well to put 'Christine von Negrusz,  _nee_ Bilkes, _divorcee_ Silberstein.' Her real name is Chane, her  father is Nathan Bilkes, and another Nathan--Nathan Silberstein--is her  first husband. Negrusz is eccentric. First he wanted to marry the  daughter of a millionaire, an Armenian baron, and when this was  forbidden, he suddenly comforted himself by falling in love with the  rather good-looking Jewess, and he bought her from her husband....\"    \"Bought?\" you will ask with surprise--\"for money--for hard cash?\"    \"Of course--why not?\" your informant will reply. \"Are you really  surprised? To a Jew everything is salable--even a wife. It is said that  Negrusz had to pay down a thousand gulden. If you do not believe me, ask  every one in Barnow, or, better still, ask Nathan Silberstein how much  he got. He is a wine-merchant, and though he is continually traveling  about, he is sure to be at home for the great feasts. He will tell you  that he gave her up to the district judge willingly. Now, I ask you, can  we associate with such a woman?\"    Emilie, the magnificent, is right for the most part. Frau Christine was  really Chane, and she had been Chane Bilkes, and afterward Chane  Silberstein. The wine-merchant had given her up voluntarily to the  district judge. She was right also when she said that it was impossible  for her--Emilie--to know such a person. She was quite wrong about the  money transaction.    The price paid was not a bank-note, but a human heart.           *       *       *       *       *    The synagogue is a gray weather-beaten building, erected long ago,  almost in the middle ages. The country people call it the Judenburg  (Jews' strong-hold), because the Jews once took refuge in it, and  intrenched themselves there, when Prince Czartoryski came to murder and  rob them. One of his reasons for doing so was that he wanted sport, and  there were no foxes or wild boars to be found in the neighborhood in the  hunting season; and another was, that he wanted money. The Jews hid  themselves and their property behind the walls and iron bars of the  synagogue, and held out until the men of Jagiellnica arrived from their  neighboring fortress, and relieved them. At that time the walls of the  Judenburg were strong, and the iron-work firm; but the bars are all  broken now, or they are lost, and the walls are half in ruins. As if to  testify to the importance of the building as a holy refuge, the poorest  of the Jews' houses are built round it on three sides. On the fourth  side, the sluggish river Lered flows so close to the synagogue that  there is only space for two dwellings. One of these is a large new  house, painted yellow--an unusual decoration in this vicinity--and the  other is a dirty, ruinous cottage clinging forlornly to the bank of the  river. The yellow house seems to be shoving its poorer neighbor over the  brink, the moldering walls of the hovel hang so directly above the slow  sad water. The rich wine-merchant, Manasse Silberstein, used to live  with his son in the large house, and a very poor man, Nathan Bilkes, had  lived for many years in the hovel.    Nathan had been a _dorfgeher_ (peddler) as long as his strength had  lasted, and then he spent a weak lonely old age upon his hardly earned  savings, eked out by the charity of the community. He had become  prematurely old and weak, like most people of his hard-working,  poverty-stricken class.    A _dorfgeher_ means, in the language of his co-religionists, a traveler  who gains his livelihood by supplying the surrounding villages with the  necessaries of life. On Sundays he tramps out of the town with an  enormous pack upon his back, in which is stored all that the heart of a  Ruthenian peasant could wish for, except the one thing most desired--for  the _dorfgeher_ does not sell schnapps.    Everything else he sells: straw hats, leather belts, boots,  clasp-knives, flowers, ribbons, corals, love-philters, stuffs for gowns,  spindles, linen, tallow, hardware, images of the saints, charms,  wax-candles, needles, linen thread, and newspapers of the last week. He  sells everything, and all are his customers--from the cavalry officers,  who buy his smuggled cigars, and the pastors and gentry, who buy his  fine stuffs, to the poorest peasant. Throughout the whole week he goes  from village to village, from house to house--in the height of summer  and the depth of winter. He knows everybody, and all know him. If they  require his wares they invite him to cross their thresholds; if they  want to buy nothing they drive him away, and if he does not go  immediately they hound their dogs at him. The peasant and the noble, the  chaplain and the young lieutenants, sharpen their wits at his expense;  and if their jokes are not always ready, they try their switches and  spurs. But he never wearies, and from early morning until late evening  he raises his hoarse cry, and haggles and cheats wherever he can. If he  can not get money in exchange for his wares, he will take what he can  get--skins, grain, chickens, ducks, or eggs. On Friday afternoons he  returns to town, and for one whole day he feels himself a man; but on  Sunday he becomes nothing but a _dorfgeher_ again....    Nathan Bilkes was a _dorfgeher_, and the above is a description of his  life, which differed in no way from that of others of his trade. His  father had found him a wife in due time. She had proved most excellent,  but had died soon after her marriage, leaving two children.    The children grew up, strong and beautiful, in the dark cheerless  cottage, as one sometimes sees sweet flowers blooming in the midst of  rubbish and decay. But their father bewailed their strength and beauty,  for these qualities lost them to him. His children so passed out of his  life that he grew to look upon them as dead. The son was obliged to  become a soldier, because Nathan could not pay the fifty gulden that  were required to obtain his release. Baer Blitzer, the broker, had said  that it could be done for fifty gulden, but the money was not there. The  lad went to Italy with his regiment, and after the battle of Magenta his  name was in the official list as \"missing.\" His old father waited long  for his return, but he never came back. His daughter, too, died to him.  \"My Chane,\" the old man took care to say, \"was a beautiful Jewess; but I  do not know the heathen (_goje_) Frau Christine.\"    The _dorfgeher_ had not foreseen that his daughter would be a source of  trouble to him. His Chane had been as obedient as she was lovely,  modest, and industrious. She was not alone beloved by her father--she  was a universal favorite.    No one grudged her good luck when old Manasse Silberstein sought her  hand in marriage for his only son Nathan. It was a great and unexpected  good fortune; for these people are strictly divided into classes, and  the rich and poor seldom intermarry. This custom is natural; for the  only occupation they were permitted to follow was money-making, thus the  possession of wealth has been their sole happiness for many generations.    The poor peddler was at first incredulous. Old Manasse was very rich,  and had a large grocery business, and a prosperous trade in Hungarian  and Moldavian wines. It was a great distinction for the poor girl that  his choice fell upon her.    Nathan Silberstein was a man of irreproachable character. He was a  fine-looking young fellow, honest, straightforward, and intelligent, and  knew the Talmud as well as he knew his trade. As he was to be a  merchant, his father had had him taught High German. With the help of  his teacher he learned reading and writing, and waded through a  \"complete letter-writer,\" and a \"complete index of German municipal  law.\" These two books were supposed to represent his German library; but  hidden in his bookcase, under great Hebrew folios, was one other little  German book. On Saturday afternoons, when he went to spend his holiday  in the park, he took this little volume in his pocket. He read it in a  solitary corner where the green leaves rustled around him, and at these  times he felt something within him moving in sympathy with the poetry,  of which he was unconscious during the rest of the week. Perhaps it was  his heart beating. On the back of the book the title was written in gilt  letters, \"Schiller's Poems.\"    When his father told him he had chosen him a wife, and who she was to  be, his heart was untouched. He answered dutifully, \"As you will,  father;\" but the color left his face as he spoke. The girl was as  obedient to her father as he was to his, only she blushed instead of  turning pale when she heard the name of her future husband.    The betrothal took place, and three months later they were married.    In the interval, Nathan gave his _fiancee_ presents of costly pearls and  precious stones; and she embroidered a robe in gold and silver for him  to wear in the synagogue. Their conversations were always on indifferent  subjects. They did not talk of themselves or their future life, and they  did not talk of the past; for though they had been neighbors all their  lives, they had no mutual recollections.    The marriage was solemnized with great pomp and ceremony: wine flowed  liberally, mountains of meat and confectionery were consumed, and the  best musicians and merry-andrews enlivened the guests. The young people  then took up their abode in the large roomy house opposite the Dominican  monastery, which Manasse had prepared for his son. They led a busy life;  their days were spent in labor, and they lived on pleasant friendly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#11)"],[1," acquire, if it knows all that it needs to know, it flourishes and  leaves descendants behind it. But then it possesses innate instinct, the  instinct which learns nothing and forgets nothing, the instinct which is  steadfast throughout time.    The building up of theories has never appealed to me: I suspect them one  and all. To argue nebulously upon dubious premises likes me no better. I  observe, I experiment and I let the facts speak for themselves. We have  just heard these facts. Let each now decide for himself whether instinct  is an innate faculty or an acquired habit.        CHAPTER 4. THE CETONIA-LARVA.    The Scolia's feeding-period lasts, on the average, for a dozen days or  so. By then the victuals are no more than a crumpled bag, a skin emptied  of the last scrap of nutriment. A little earlier, the russet-yellow tint  announces the extinction of the last spark of life in the creature that  is being devoured. The empty skin is pushed back to make space; the  dining-room, a shapeless cavity with crumbling walls, is tidied up a  little; and the Scolia-grub sets to work on its cocoon without further  delay.    The first courses form a general scaffolding, which finds a support  here and there on the earthen walls, and consist of a rough, blood-red  fabric. When the larva is merely laid, as required by my investigations,  in a hollow made with the finger-tip in the bed of mould, it is not able  to spin its cocoon, for want of a ceiling to which to fasten the upper  threads of its network. To weave its cocoon, every spinning larva  is compelled to isolate itself in a hammock slung in an open-work  enclosure, which enables it to distribute its thread uniformly in all  directions. If there be no ceiling, the upper part of the cocoon cannot  be fashioned, because the worker lacks the necessary points of support.  Under these conditions my Scolia-grubs contrive at most to upholster  their little pit with a thick down of reddish silk. Discouraged by  futile endeavours, some of them die. It is as if they had been killed by  the silk which they omit to disgorge because they are unable to make the  right use of it. This, if we were not watchful, would be a very frequent  cause of failure in our attempts at artificial rearing. But, once the  danger has been perceived, the remedy is simple. I make a ceiling over  the cavity by laying a short strip of paper above it. If I want to see  how matters are progressing, I bend the strip into a semicircle, into  a half-cylinder with open ends. Those who wish to play the breeder for  themselves will be able to profit by these little practical details.    In twenty-four hours the cocoon is finished; at least, it no longer  allows us to see the grub, which is doubtless making the walls of its  dwelling still thicker. At first the cocoon is a vivid red; later it  changes to a light chestnut-brown. Its form is that of an ellipsoid,  with a major axis 26 millimetres in length, while the minor axis  measures 11 millimetres. (1.014 x.429 inch.--Translator's Note.) These  dimensions, which incidentally are inclined to vary slightly, are those  of the female cocoons. In the other sex they are smaller and may measure  as little as 17 millimetres in length by 7 millimetres in width. (.663  x.273 inch.--Translator's Note.)    The two ends of the ellipsoid have the same form, so much so that it is  only thanks to an individual peculiarity, independent of the shape, that  we can tell the cephalic from the anal extremity. The cephalic pole is  flexible and yields to the pressure of my tweezers; the anal pole is  hard and unyielding. The wrapper is double, as in the cocoons of  the Sphex. (Cf. \"The Hunting Wasps\": chapters 4 to 10 et  passim.--Translator's Note.) The outer envelope, consisting of pure  silk, is thin, flexible and offers little resistance. It is closely  superimposed upon the inner envelope and is easily separated from it  everywhere, except at the anal end, where it adheres to the second  envelope. The adhesion of the two wrappers at one end and the  non-adhesion at the other are the cause of the differences which the  tweezers reveal when pinching the two ends of the cocoon.    The inner envelope is firm, elastic, rigid and, to a certain point,  brittle. I do not hesitate to look upon it as consisting of a silken  tissue which the larva, towards the end of its task, has steeped  thoroughly in a sort of varnish prepared not by the silk-glands but by  the stomach. The cocoons of the Sphex have already shown us a similar  varnish. This product of the chylific ventricle is chestnut-brown. It is  this which, saturating the thickness of the tissue, effaces the bright  red of the beginning and replaces it by a brown tint. It is this again  which, disgorged more profusely at the lower end of the cocoon, glues  the two wrappers together at that point.    The perfect insect is hatched at the beginning of July. The emergence  takes place without any violent effraction, without any ragged rents. A  clean, circular fissure appears at some distance from the top; and the  cephalic end is detached all of a piece, as a loose lid might be. It is  as though the recluse had only to raise a cover by butting it with her  head, so exact is the line of division, at least as regards the inner  envelope, the stronger and more important of the two. As for the outer  wrapper, its lack of resistance enables it to yield without difficulty  when the other gives way.    I cannot quite make out by what knack the Wasp contrives to detach the  cap of the inner shell with such accuracy. Is it the art practised by  the tailor when cutting his stuff, with mandibles taking the place of  scissors? I hardly venture to admit as much: the tissue is so tough and  the circle of division so precise. The mandibles are not sharp enough to  cut without leaving a ragged edge; and then what geometrical certainty  they would need for an operation so perfect that it might well have been  performed with the compasses!    I suspect therefore that the Scolia first fashions the outer sac in  accordance with the usual method, that is, by distributing the silk  uniformly, without any special preparation of one part of the wall more  than of another, and that it afterwards changes its method of weaving in  order to attend to the main work, the inner shell. In this it  apparently imitates the Bembex (Cf. \"The Hunting Wasps\": chapters 14 to  16.--Translator's Note.), which weaves a sort of eel-trap, whose ample  mesh allows it to gather grains of sand outside and encrust them one  by one in the silky network, and completes the performance with a cap  fitting the entrance to the trap. This provides a circular line of least  resistance, along which the casket breaks open afterwards. If the Scolia  really works in the same manner, everything is explained: the eel-trap,  while still open, enables it to soak with varnish both the inside and  the outside of the inner shell, which has to acquire the consistency  of parchment; lastly, the cap which completes and closes the structure  leaves for the future a circular line capable of splitting easily and  neatly.    This is enough on the subject of the Scolia-grub. Let us go back to  its provender, of whose remarkable structure we as yet know nothing. In  order that it may be consumed with the delicate anatomical discretion  imposed by the necessity of having fresh food to the last, the  Cetonia-grub must be plunged into a state of absolute immobility: any  twitchings on its part--as the experiments which I have undertaken go  to prove--would discourage our nibbling larva and impede the work of  carving, which has to be effected with so much circumspection. It is not  enough for the victim to be unable to move from place to place beneath  the soil: in addition to this, the contractible power in its sturdy  muscular organism must be suppressed.    In its normal state, this larva, at the very least disturbance, curls  itself up, almost as the Hedgehog does; and the two halves of the  ventral surface are laid one against the other. You are quite surprised  at the strength which the creature displays in keeping itself thus  contracted. If you try to unroll it, your fingers encounter a resistance  far greater than the size of the animal would have caused you to  suspect. To overcome the resistance of this sort of spring coiled upon  itself, you have to force it, so much so that you are afraid, if you  persist, of seeing the indomitable spiral suddenly burst and shoot forth  its entrails.    A similar muscular energy is found in the larvae of the Oryctes (Also  known as the Rhinoceros Beetle.--Translator's Note.), the Anoxia (A  Beetle akin to the Cockchafer.--Translator's Note.), the Cockchafer.  Weighed down by a heavy belly and living underground, where they feed  either on leaf-mould or on roots, these larvae all possess the vigorous  constitution needed to drag their corpulence through a resisting medium.  All of them also roll themselves into a hook which is not straightened  without an effort.    Now what would become of the egg and the new-born grub of the Scoliae,  fixed under the belly, at the centre of the Cetonia's spiral, or inside  the hook of the Oryctes or the Anoxia? They would be crushed between the  jaws of the living vice. It is essential that the arc should slacken and  the hook unbend, without the least possibility of their returning to  a state of tension. Indeed, the well-being of the Scoliae demands  something more: those powerful bodies must not retain even the power to  quiver, lest they derange a method of feeding which has to be conducted  with the greatest caution.    The Cetonia-grub to which the Two-banded Scolia's egg is fastened  fulfils the required conditions admirably. It is lying on its back, in  the midst of the mould, with its belly fully extended. Long accustomed  though I be to this spectacle of victims paralysed by the sting of  the Hunting Wasp, I"]]]
