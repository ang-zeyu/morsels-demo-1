[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#11)"],[1," was dismayed to  learn that the confident youth had sailed without any further  instruction in the question than a man might secure from the hurried  perusal of the scraps which from day to day appeared in the morning  press.    As a special correspondent, I adduce, with ill-suppressed triumph, the  case of the Hon. George Tackle as an awful warning to all newspaper  proprietors who allow their parental affections to overcome their good  judgment.    All that the Hon. George knew was that at Lukati there had been four  well-authenticated cases of barbarous acts of cruelty against natives,  and that the Commissioner of the district was responsible for the  whippings and the torture. He thought, did the Hon. George, that this  was all that it was necessary to know. But this is where he made his big  mistake.    Up at Lukati all sorts of things happened, as Commissioner Sanders  knows, to his cost. Once he visited the district and left it tranquil,  and for Carter, his deputy, whom he left behind, the natives built a  most beautiful hut, planting gardens about, all off their own bat.    One day, when Carter had just finished writing an enthusiastic report on  the industry of his people, and the whole-hearted way they were taking  up and supporting the new rgime, the chief of the village, whom Carter  had facetiously named O'Leary (his born name was indeed Olari), came to  him.    Carter at the moment was walking through the well-swept street of the  village with his hands in his coat pockets and his big white helmet  tipped on the back of his head because the sun was setting at his back.    \"Father,\" said the Chief Olari, \"I have brought these people to see  you.\"    He indicated with a wave of his hand six strange warriors carrying their  shields and spears, who looked at him dispassionately.    Carter nodded.    \"They desire,\" said Olari, \"to see the wonderful little black fetish  that my father carries in his pocket that they may tell their people of  its powers.\"    \"Tell your people,\" said Carter good-humouredly, \"that I have not got  the fetish with me--if they will come to my hut I will show them its  wonders.\"    Whereupon Olari lifted his spear and struck at Carter, and the six  warriors sprang forward together. Carter fought gamely, but he was  unarmed.    When Sanders heard the news of his subordinate's death he did not faint  or fall into a fit of insane cursing. He was sitting on his broad  verandah at headquarters when the dusty messenger came. He rose with  pursed lips and frowning eyes, fingering the letter--this came from  Tollemache, inspector of police at Bokari--and paced the verandah.    \"Poor chap, poor chap!\" was all that he said.    He sent no message to Olari; he made no preparations for a punitive  raid; he went on signing documents, inspecting Houssas, attending dinner  parties, as though Carter had never lived or died. All these things the  spies of Olari reported, and the chief was thankful.    Lukati being two hundred miles from headquarters, through a savage and  mountainous country, an expedition was no light undertaking, and the  British Government, rich as it is, cannot afford to spend a hundred  thousand pounds to avenge the death of a subordinate official. Of this  fact Sanders was well aware, so he employed his time in collecting and  authenticating the names of Carter's assassins. When he had completed  them he went a journey seventy miles into the bush to the great  witch-doctor Kelebi, whose name was known throughout the coast country  from Dakka to the Eastern borders of Togoland.    \"Here are the names of men who have put shame upon me,\" he said; \"but  principally Olari, chief of the Lukati people.\"    \"I will put a spell upon Olari,\" said the witch-doctor; \"a very bad  spell, and upon these men. The charge will be six English pounds.\"    Sanders paid the money, and \"dashed\" two bottles of square-face and a  piece of proper cloth. Then he went back to headquarters.    One night through the village of Lukati ran a whisper, and the men  muttered the news with fearful shivers and backward glances.    \"Olari, the chief, is cursed!\"    Olari heard the tidings from his women, and came out of his hut into the  moonlight, raving horribly.    The next day he sickened, and on the fifth day he was near to dead and  suffering terrible pains, as also were six men who helped in the slaying  of Carter. That they did not die was no fault of the witch-doctor, who  excused his failure on account of the great distance between himself and  his subjects.    As for Sanders, he was satisfied, saying that even the pains were cheap  at the price, and that it would give him great satisfaction to write  \"finis\" to Olari with his own hand.    A week after this, Abiboo, Sanders' favourite servant, was taken ill.  There was no evidence of fever or disease, only the man began to fade  as it were.    Making inquiries, Sanders discovered that Abiboo had offended the  witch-doctor Kelebi, and that the doctor had sent him the death message.    Sanders took fifty Houssas into the bush and interviewed the  witch-doctor.    \"I have reason,\" he said, \"for believing you to be a failure as a slayer  of men.\"    \"Master,\" said Kelebi in extenuation, \"my magic cannot cross mountains,  otherwise Olari and his friends would have died.\"    \"That is as it may be,\" said Sanders. \"I am now concerned with magic  nearer at hand, and I must tell you that the day after Abiboo dies I  will hang you.\"    \"Father,\" said Kelebi emphatically, \"under those circumstances Abiboo  shall live.\"    Sanders gave him a sovereign, and rode back to headquarters, to find his  servant on the high road to recovery.    I give you this fragment of Sanders' history, because it will enable you  to grasp the peculiar environment in which Sanders spent the greater  part of his life, and because you will appreciate all the better the  irony of the situation created by the coming of the Hon. George Tackle.    Sanders was taking breakfast on the verandah of his house. From where he  sat he commanded across the flaming beauties of his garden a view of a  broad, rolling, oily sea, a golden blaze of light under the hot sun.  There was a steamer lying three miles out (only in five fathoms of  water at that), and Sanders, through his glasses, recognised her as the  Elder Dempster boat that brought the monthly mail. Since there were no  letters on his table, and the boat had been \"in\" for two hours, he  gathered that there was no mail for him, and was thankful, for he had  outlived the sentimental period of life when letters were pleasant  possibilities.    Having no letters, he expected no callers, and the spectacle of the Hon.  George being carried in a hammock into his garden was astonishing.    The Hon. George carefully alighted, adjusted his white pith helmet,  smoothed the creases from his immaculate ducks, and mounted the steps  that led to the stoep.    \"How do?\" said the visitor. \"My name is Tackle--George Tackle.\" He  smiled, as though to say more was an insult to his hearer's  intelligence.    Sanders bowed, a little ceremoniously for him. He felt that his visitor  expected this.    \"I'm out on a commission,\" the Hon. George went on. \"As you've doubtless  heard, my governor is the proprietor of the _Courier and Echo_, and so  he thought I'd better go out and see the thing for myself. I've no doubt  the whole thing is exaggerated----\"    \"Hold hard,\" said Sanders, a light dawning on him. \"I gather that you  are a sort of correspondent of a newspaper?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"That you have come to inquire into----\"    \"Treatment of natives, and all that,\" said the Hon. George easily.    \"And what is wrong with the treatment of the native?\" asked Sanders  sweetly.    The hon. gentleman made an indefinite gesture.    \"You know--things in newspapers--missionaries,\" he said rapidly, being  somewhat embarrassed by the realisation that the man, if any,  responsible for the outrages was standing before him.    \"I never read the newspapers,\" said Sanders, \"and----\"    \"Of course,\" interrupted the Hon. George eagerly, \"we can make it all  right as far as you are concerned.\"    \"Oh, thank you!\" Sanders' gratitude was a little overdone, but he held  out his hand. \"Well, I wish you luck--let me know how you get on.\"    The Hon. George Tackle was frankly nonplussed.    \"But excuse me,\" he said, \"where--how----Hang it all, where am I to put  up?\"    \"Here?\"    \"Yes -- dash it, my kit is on shore! I thought----\"    \"You thought I'd put you up?\"    \"Well, I did think----\"    \"That I'd fall on your neck and welcome you?\"    \"Not exactly, but----\"    \"Well,\" said Sanders, carefully folding his napkin, \"I'm not so glad to  see you as all that.\"    \"I suppose not,\" said the Hon. George, bridling.    \"Because you're a responsibility--I hate extra responsibility. You can  pitch your tent just wherever you like--but I cannot offer you the  hospitality you desire.\"    \"I shall report this matter to the Administrator,\" said the Hon. George  ominously.    \"You may report it to my grandmother's maiden aunt,\" said Sanders  politely.    Half an hour later he saw the Hon. George rejoin the ship that brought  him to Isisi Bassam, and chuckled. George would go straight to the  Administrator, and would receive a reception beside which a Sahara storm  would be zephyrs of Araby.    At the same time Sanders was a little puzzled, and not a little hurt.  There never had been a question of atrocities in his district, and he  was puzzled to account for the rumours that had brought the  \"commissioner\" on his tour of investigation--could it be a distorted  account of Olari's punishment?    \"Go quickly to the ship, taking a book to the lord who has just gone  from here,\" was his command to a servant, and proceeded to scribble a  note:--        \"I am afraid,\" he wrote, \"I was rather rude to you--not      understanding what the devil you were driving at. An      overwhelming curiosity directs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#11)"],[1," inheritance for immortality and eternal life; with the holy city for  its capital, the throne of God in the midst, for its seat of  government; and watered with a stream, clear as crystal, called the  Waters of Life, issuing from the throne of Jehovah; while either side  is adorned with trees of never fading beauty. \"Blessed are they that  do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life,  and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" By this time we  begin to understand the words of the Savior: \"Blessed are the meek,  for they shall inherit the earth.\" And also the song which John heard  in heaven, which ended thus: \"We shall reign on the EARTH.\"    Reader, do not be startled; suppose you were to be caught up into  heaven, there to stand with the redeemed of every nation, kindred,  tongue, and people, and join them in singing, and to your  astonishment, all heaven is filled with joy, while they tune the  immortal lyre, in joyful anticipation of one day reigning on the  earth--a planet now under the dominion of Satan, the abode of  wretchedness and misery, from which your glad spirit had taken its  flight, and, as you supposed, an everlasting farewell. You might  perhaps be startled for a moment, and inquire within yourself: \"Why  have I never heard this theme sung among the churches on earth?\" Well,  my friend, the answer would be--\"Because you lived in a day when  people did not understand the Scriptures.\"    Abraham would tell you, you should have read the promise of God to  him, Gen. xvii, 8, where God not only promised the land of Canaan to  his seed for an everlasting possession, but also to him. Then you  should have read the testimony of Stephen, Acts, vii, 5, by which you  would have ascertained that Abraham never had inherited the things  promised, but was still expecting to rise from the dead and be brought  into the land of Canaan, to inherit them. \"Yes,\" says Ezekiel, \"if you  had read the thirty-seventh chapter of my prophecies, you would have  found a positive promise, that God would open the graves of the whole  house of Israel, who were dead, and gather up their dry bones, and put  them together, each to its own proper place, and even clothe them  again with flesh, sinews, and skin, and put His Spirit in them, and  they should live; and then, instead of being caught up to heaven, they  should be brought into the land of Canaan, which the Lord gave them,  and they should inherit it.\"    But, still astonished, you might turn to Job; and he, surprised to  find one unacquainted with so plain a subject, would exclaim: \"Did you  never read my nineteenth chapter, from the twenty-third to the  twenty-seventh verses, where I declare, I wish my words were written  in a book, saying, that my Redeemer would stand on the earth in the  latter-day; and that I should see Him in the flesh, for myself, and  not another; though worms should destroy this body?\" Even David, the  sweet singer of Israel, would call to your mind the thirty-seventh  Psalm, where he repeatedly declares that the meek shall inherit the  earth forever, after the wicked are cut off from the face thereof.    And last of all, to set the matter forever at rest, the voice of the  Savior would mildly fall upon your ear, in his sermon on the mount,  declaring emphatically: \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit  the earth.\" To these things you would answer: \"I have read these  passages, to be sure, but was always taught to believe that they did  not mean so, therefore, I never understood them until now. Let me go  and tell the people what wonders have opened to my view, since my  arrival in heaven, merely from having heard one short song. It is  true, I have heard much of the glories of heaven described, while on  earth, but never once thought of their rejoicing in anticipation of  returning to the earth.\" Says the Savior: \"They have Moses and the  Prophets; if they will not believe them, neither would they believe  although one should rise from the dead.\"    We will now return to the subject of the coming of Messiah, and the  ushering in of that glorious day, called the Millennium, or rest of a  thousand years. We gather from the field of prophecy, through which we  have passed: first, that that glorious day will be ushered in by the  personal coming of Christ, and the resurrection of all the saints;  second, that all the wicked will be destroyed from the earth, by  overwhelming judgments of God, and by fire, at the time of His coming,  insomuch that the earth will be cleansed by fire from its wicked  inhabitants, as it once was by water; and this burning will include  priests as well as people: all but a few shall be burned. This burning  more especially applies to the fallen church, rather than to the  heathen or Jews, whom they are now trying to convert. Woe unto you,  Gentiles, who call yourselves the people of the Lord, but have made  void the law of God by your traditions; for in vain do you call Lord,  Lord, and do not the things which Jesus commands; in vain do ye  worship Him, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Behold,  the sword of vengeance hangs over you, and except you repent, it will  soon fall upon you; and it will be more tolerable in that day for the  Jews and heathen than for you. Behold, ye flatter yourselves that the  glorious day spoken of by the Prophets will be ushered in by your  modern inventions and moneyed plans, which are got up in order to  convert the Jews and heathen to the various sectarian principles now  existing among yourselves; and you expect, when this is done, to  behold a millennium after your own heart. But the Jews and heathen  never will be converted, as a people, to any other plan than that laid  down in the Bible for the great restoration of Israel. And _you  yourselves_ are laboring under a broken covenant, and ripening for the  fire as fast as possible. But do not count me your enemy because I  tell you the truth, for God is my witness that I love your souls too  well to keep back any truth from you, however severe it may seem. The  wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of an enemy. Now,  concerning the signs of the times, the inquiry often arises: \"When  shall these things be, and what signs shall there be when these things  shall come to pass?\" I am often asked the question, whether it is near  at hand; I will therefore tell you all, whereby you may know for  yourselves when it is nigh, even at the doors, and not be dependent on  the knowledge of others.    Now, you behold the apple tree, and all the trees, when they begin to  shoot forth their leaves, ye know of your own selves that summer is  nigh at hand; and so likewise when ye shall see great earthquakes,  famines, pestilence, and plagues of every kind; the sea breaking  beyond its bounds, and all things in commotion; the nations distressed  with perplexity; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking  for the things which are coming on the earth; when you see signs in  the heaven above, and in the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor  of smoke, the sun turned to darkness, the moon to blood, and stars  hurled from their courses; when you see the Jews gathering to  Jerusalem, and the armies of the nations gathering against them to  battle, you may know, with a perfect knowledge, that Christ's coming  is near, even at the doors. \"_Verily, I say_ unto you, _this_  generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled.\" Heaven  and earth shall pass away, but not one word of all that the Lord has  spoken by the mouth of His holy Prophets and Apostles shall fail.    Whoever will look to the word of the Prophets, and to the sayings of  Jesus Christ, on this subject, the same will be convinced that all the  signs of which I have spoken are clearly pointed out as the signs of  His coming. But, notwithstanding all these things are written, His  coming will overtake the world unawares, as the flood did the people  in the days of Noah. The reason is, they will not understand the  Prophets. They will not endure sound doctrine; their ears are turned  away from the truth, and turned to fables, because of false teachers,  and the precepts of men; and what is still worse, when God sends men  with the New and Everlasting Covenant, and clothes them with boldness  to testify to the truth, they will be treated as the servants of God  have been before them by the fallen churches; every church will cleave  to its own way, and will unite in saying: \"There is no need of these  new things, the good old way is right;\" while at the same time they  are walking in as many different ways as there are sects, and only  agree in persecuting and speaking all manner of evil against the  fishers and hunters whom God shall send. But, thank heaven, there are  individuals in every sect who are humbly seeking the truth, and who  will know the voice of truth, and be gathered out, and planted in the  New and Everlasting Covenant; and they will be adopted into the family  of Israel, and will be gathered with them, and be partakers of the  same covenant of promise. Yea, as Jeremiah says, in the sixteenth  chapter of his Prophecies: \"The Gentiles shall come unto thee from the  ends of the earth, and shall say, surely our fathers have inherited  lies, vanities, and things wherein there is no profit.\" But as the  Jews overlooked Christ's first coming, by not understanding the  Prophets, and fastening their whole expectations on His glorious  coming in the last days, to restore the kingdom to Israel, and avenge  them of their enemies, and, by this mistake, were broken and  scattered; so the Gentiles will overlook the prophecies concerning His  second coming, by confounding them with the last judgment, which is to  take place more than a thousand years afterward. But this fatal  mistake, instead of causing the Gentiles to be broken and scattered,  will cause them to be ground to powder.    O my brethren, according to "]]]
