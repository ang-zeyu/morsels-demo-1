Once married, there  is no escape from its lifelong duties and responsibilities. She must  yield to him whatever the marriage vow allows, that she may become a  _wife_ in the fullest sense of the term. Marriage is a sacred relation,  instituted by God Himself, and the sexual approach which follows between  husband and wife, is a special avowal of their relation to each other;  and so often as it is repeated it is a renewal of their obligations to  be faithful to each other. All sexuality is in the order of creation  and, coming from the Lord, serves for high and holy purposes. It was  _never_ intended for mere carnal pleasure; as such, it is the  profanation and perversion of a great boon to the human race. The man or  woman who perverts it must and will, sooner or later, suffer a penalty  equal to the transgression.    The husband rightfully expects to find in his wife, as a seal of the  marriage covenant, his greatest possible delight. It should be her  greatest delight to give him that pleasure; and if she loves her husband  according to her avowal, she will not fail to do this. The feeling, each  of the other's nearness--in thought, word and act, as though each one  were intertwined with the other in the most complete union, is a very  great delight; even indescribably great. The sexual act itself is really  a type of the perfect harmony in which the married pair should dwell  throughout their lives. It teaches a mutual yielding so that the  honeymoon, rising so beautifully and lovingly, may continue to wax  lighter and brighter and its fullness be attained in this world only at  the dissolution, by a natural death, of a union so orderly and happily  formed. It is in the very nature of the male to seek his mate; it is an  inborn principle for him to do so, and his health, even his life,  certainly his moral life, often depends upon an orderly and lawful  indulgence of what this inherent principle demands. The greatest  longevity and the best health are found among fathers and mothers;  thereby proving that orderly and well-regulated sexual intercourse is  just as necessary to the married couple as are the functional demands of  all other organs of the body. From the foregoing it may be plainly  inferred, that, if the wife of a chaste young man who has duly guarded  himself from his childhood up, until he has sought and wedded his mate,  fails to reciprocate cheerfully and pleasantly in the seal of connubial  affection, she proves a bitter disappointment to him. Not that he is  carnal, gross or beastly, no! The principle given him by his Creator and  residing in his pure and inmost soul has been violated by her in whom he  placed his life's confidence; she has proved _false_ to him in this  particular, one upon which their present and eternal welfare so largely  depends. Young ladies about to marry should be taught to understand this  matter most fully, in all its bearings. If they pervert marriage in  false practices, the love of God, conjugal love, and the love of  infants, the three holiest and noblest inspirations of life, perish  together. No woman then should ever marry without a full knowledge of  her duties to her husband, particularly in the sexual respect; for  without granting this privilege to her husband in full and free accord,  there _cannot_ be maintained a happy married life.    _The duties of marriage_, as a topic, embrace a vast field of thought;  and there is _so much_ to say thereon, so much advice to tender, so many  absolute commands to enjoin, so many warnings to utter, that it is with  difficulty I restrain myself from launching out diffusely in an attempt  to give the most important of these. But to so specifically particularize  is not the purpose of this book. Enough is said herein, I trust, to set  the reflective mind to thinking seriously on these matters and thereby  to awaken the conscience to a full sense of its duties. Quite too many  cases have come under my observation where the marriage vow has never  been consummated or, if consummated at all, in a very begrudging manner,  owing to the insubordination of the wife. Consequently dissatisfaction,  unhappiness and frequently a permanent separation follows, bringing  disgrace upon the family and scandal to their circle of friends. This is  not only wrong, but it is a most unpardonable vice. Sexuality has been  ordained by God in his wisdom as the means of creation. It exists  throughout all nature, in every tree, plant and shrub, in every animal  and insect; in every bird that flies, in every fish that swims, in every  man and woman. The very best and purest of husbands and wives, all the  world over, indulge in sexuality to their united satisfaction, in full  acknowledgment that it is of God and from God. Every wife who is  unreasonable or derelict in this _duty_ is untrue to her husband and  commits a sin against the God of Heaven and earth. Since, then,  sexuality is so evidently of Divine appointment, it should be committed  entirely to him in its effects.[I]      [I] See \"In Health.\" By Dr. A. J. Ingersoll, Corning, N. Y.    If at any time the act prove fruitful and a child be born, it should be  considered as a great blessing and gift from God Himself. What is more  beautiful than to see a married couple engaged in rearing a new human  being destined to become an angel in Heaven! For this indeed is the  prime object of sexuality and of the marriage covenant. As has been well  said, life on earth is Heaven's seminary. And yet, so many wives, to  their shame be it said, use preventives to conception, thus attempting  to controvert the order of Nature and Nature's God; this is one of the  greatest crimes of the present age and vengeance will surely be taken on  every transgressor in this sacred matter. Such practice is secret vice  which little by little wears upon the inmost vital principle until the  perpetrators of such wrongs suffer untold misery in their physical  nature--often not even suspecting the cause of such sufferings.    \"But there is yet another reason, and a very strong moral one, why the  wife should not remain childless. There can be no question that the  blood of the father mingles with that of the mother through the medium  of the child _in utero_. (Hence the transmission of blood-diseases from  husband to wife.) Hence the indelible impressions made upon a wife by  the father of her offspring--impressions, both mental and physical,  which by character or resemblance she often transmits to her children by  a second husband. Now, * * * * may not this account for the similarity  of character and identity of tastes, and, indeed, for that wonderful  personal resemblance, which sometimes develops between husband and wife?  And does not this requisite alone fulfil the Divine interpretation of  marriage, that 'they are no more twain but one flesh?'\"[J]      [J] Wm. Goodell, M. D., \"Lessons in Gynecology,\" P. 442.    After marriage a new order of life is entered upon by the wife, and her  family matters should subordinate all other schemes and projects of her  future existence. Her main thought and study should now be, \"How can I  best fulfil these new duties and responsibilities? First, my dear  husband! how can I be a true help-meet to him? Here we two are to be  one, a new _punctum saliens_, and every act of ours will bear the image  of our united lives. No matter what may happen, I will be true to my  matrimonial vow and to my God; for I am in His hands and my dear  husband's.\" A married life begun in this way, with such resolutions  sincerely and studiously kept, will secure a life full of happiness and  privileges beyond the fondest hope and expectation. When pregnancy  occurs, just as soon as the fact be suspected, the little embryo should  be regarded as already a member of the family. Every act of each parent  should now be performed in some degree with reference to the forth-coming  infant. The mother's thoughts particularly should be directed to it as  much as possible whilst performing the uses of life. She should read  much that is elevating and ennobling in character as this serves a good  purpose in producing a more perfect, more healthy and more brilliant  child. Let her read such books as \"Elements of Character\" by Miss  Chandler; \"Growth of the Mind\" by S. Reed; \"Sex in Education\" by E. H.  Clarke, M. D.; also, \"Wear and Tear\" by S. Weir Mitchell, M. D.; and any  other books of like character. Do not forget that the education of the  child begins _in utero_.    During gestation the mother should subsist as far as possible upon  fruit, vegetables and a farinaceous diet--always plain and without  spices. Plenty of active exercise is indispensable and the use of a  \"Health Lift\" will be found most beneficial. When the nine months are  completed, under care of a competent physician, the birth of the child  will be accomplished with but comparatively little pain, and its  attendant dangers and difficulties will be greatly lessened.          CHAPTER VIII.    Marriage [concluded].    Husband and Wife.      To preserve the marriage vow inviolate, the same pure love that brought  the two together should be cultivated by home uses and home amusements  such as readings, games, conversation, etc. If the wife have needle  work, let the husband read or talk to her; if he be a literary man, let  her presence cheer him on and inspire him to nobler and more refined  productions. What was done during courtship that made time pass so  rapidly and so pleasantly? Was every topic so discussed and used up that  nothing is now left for an exchange of views? Is carnal pleasure to be  the only binding tie? Such a life is not very pure and only a poor use  can be made of it. Topics of interest to a married pair should be  innumerable and their pleasures inexhaustible.

A not uncommon summer resident in parts of Florida and the coastal  region of Georgia and South Carolina, with the general habits and  appearance of our Kingbird, but with a quite different call which  suggests the words _pitirri-pitirri_. It nests in May, laying four  salmon-colored eggs, marked with dark brown and lilac.      CRESTED FLYCATCHER    _Myiarchus crinitus. Case 7, Fig. 5_              The reddish brown tail-feathers may sometimes be            seen and the crest is usually evident. L. 9.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from Florida            to Canada; winters in the tropics, reaching            Florida on its northward journey in March.              Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 29.            Ossining, common S.R., May 7-Sept. 12. Cambridge,            rare S.R., May 15-Sept. 11. N. Ohio, common S.R.,            Apl. 25-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May            1-Sept. 18. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 25.    A character of the woods distinguished alike by appearance, voice and  habits. His crested head seems too big for his body; his exclamatory  whistle, which sounds like a shout above a monotone of conversation, his  habit of always lining his nest with a cast-off snake skin, all mark him  as an odd genius. Even his wife's eggs, with their long chocolate  streaks, are quite unlike any other birds' eggs. They are laid in a hole  in a tree in May or June.      PHOEBE    _Soyornis phoebe. Case 4, Fig. 52; Case 5, Fig. 15_              Head slightly crested, somewhat darker than body.            In the fall the underparts are tinged with yellow.            L. 7.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from            northern Mississippi and northwestern Georgia to            Canada; winters from South Carolina to Mexico. The            only Flycatcher to winter in the eastern United            States and hence the first to reach us in the            spring.              Washington, common S.R., Feb. 25-Oct.;            occasionally winters. Ossining, common S.R., Mch.            14-Oct. 29. Cambridge, common T.V., and not            uncommon S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 10. N. Ohio, common            S.R., Mch. 14-Oct. 15. Glen Ellyn, S.R., Mch.            13-Oct. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 22-Oct.            11.    The Phoebe is the best known member of a group of small Flycatchers  which the beginner, and not infrequently the advanced student, names  with more or less uncertainty. Fortunately for the field student, and as  if to compensate for their close resemblance in plumage, they all  possess distinctive, quite unlike, and easily recognizable calls, and  consequently can readily be identified by their voices if not by their  colors.    The Phoebe shows so marked a fondness for our society, nesting under  our piazzas, in barns or outbuildings, and calls his _pewit-phoebe_ so  plainly, wagging his tail the while in a friendly, sociable kind of a  way, that there is never any doubt about his identity; but we will not  make the acquaintance of his less common, less confiding relatives so  readily.    The Phoebe's 4-6 white eggs (rarely with a few brown spots) are laid  the latter half of April.      OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER    _Nuttalornis borealis. Case 8, Fig. 59_              With the general appearance of a large Phoebe,            but with the breast and sides the color of the            back, and a tuft of white feathers on each flank.            L. 7-1/2.              _Range._ North America; nests from northern New            England northward (southward in the Alleghanies to            North Carolina); winters in the tropics.              Washington, casual T.V. Ossining, tolerably common            T.V., May 20; Aug. 15-Sept. 16. Cambridge, rare            T.V., May 20-June 6; formerly not uncommon S.R.,            one Sept. record. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May            13-June 11; Aug. 11-Sept. 15. SE. Minn., common            T.V., May 10-Sept. 9.    To most of us the Olive-sided is known as a rare migrant passing  northward in May, among the later transients, and southward in  September. When traveling the bird retains the fondness of its kind for  perching on tall tree-tops, but its loud, unmistakable, whistled \"come  right _here_, come right _here_\" is usually heard only on the nesting  ground.    The nest is placed in coniferous trees about 25 feet up, and 3-5 white,  brown-spotted eggs are laid in June.      WOOD PEWEE    _Myiochanes virens. Case 8, Fig. 63_              Resembles the Phoebe but is smaller with            relatively longer wings and more evident            wing-bars. L. 6-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nesting from            Florida to Canada; winters in the tropics.              Washington, common S.R., Apl. 20-Oct. 12.            Ossining, common S.R., May 10-Oct. 2. Cambridge,            common T.V., not uncommon S.R., May 18-Sept. 15.            N. Ohio, abundant S.R., May 2-Sept. 27. Glen            Ellyn, fairly common S.R., May 9-Sept. 29. SE.            Minn., common S.R., May 10-Sept. 23.    In color Phoebe and Pewee are much alike and both are Flycatchers, but  the resemblance ends there. Pewee loves the solitude of the forest  rather than the sociability of the barnyard, and his pensive _pee-a-wee_  does not even suggest the business-like _pewit-phoebe_ of his  better-known cousin. Nor does his dainty lichen-covered nest saddled so  skillfully on the limb of a forest tree, recall the Phoebe's bulky  moss and mud dwelling. Finally, the Pewee's eggs, laid in May, are  wreathed with brown.      YELLOW-BELLIED FLYCATCHER    _Empidonax flaviventris. Case 8. Fig. 61_              The entire underparts, including the throat, are            unquestionably sulphur-yellow. L. 5-1/2              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from            northern New York and northern New England            northward into Canada; winters in the tropics.              Washington, rather common T.V., May; July 28-Oct.            6. Ossining, common T.V., May 17-June 4; Aug.            8-Sept. 20. Cambridge, T.V., sometimes rather            common, May 25-June 3; Aug. 28-Sept. 8. N. Ohio,            rare T.V., May 10. Glen Ellyn, rather rare T.V.,            May 20-June 5; Sept. 3. SE. Minn., common T.V.,            May 19.    Known chiefly as a not common migrant who visits our woods on his  journey to and from his northern home. He is a silent traveler and gives  no clue to his identity by calling or singing, but his underparts are so  much yellower than those of any other of our small Flycatchers that they  make a definite field character. Nests in coniferous forests on the  ground, laying 4 white, lightly spotted eggs in June.      ACADIAN FLYCATCHER    _Empidonax virescens. Case 8, Fig. 60_              Throat white, upperparts bright, light            olive-green, without tinge of brown as in the            Alder Flycatcher.              _Range._ Eastern North America; rather southern,            nesting from Florida north to Connecticut and            Michigan; winters in the tropics.              Washington, common S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. Ossining,            common S.R., May 10-Aug. 27. N. Ohio, common S.R.,            May 4-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May            6-Aug. 27, and probably later.    On the low-sweeping limb of a beech over a stream is an ideal site for  the frail nest of the Acadian. The bird is never found far from it and  its low-ranging habits permit us to see its characteristic markings and  hear its peculiar sudden, explosive little _pee-e-yuk_ and more commonly  uttered _spee_ or _peet_.    The creamy white, brown-spotted eggs are laid the latter part of May.      ALDER FLYCATCHER    _Empidonax trailli alnorum. Case 8, Fig. 62_              Larger than the Least Flycatcher, but resembling            it in having the back olive-brown instead of            olive-green as in the Acadian and Yellow-bellied            Flycatchers. L. 6.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from            northern New Jersey (locally) and mountains of            West Virginia to Canada; winters in the tropics.              Washington, irregularly common T.V., May 8-May 28;            Aug. 16-Sept. 17. Ossining, rare T.V., May 19-May            31; Aug. 29. Cambridge, rare T.V., May 28-June 6;            Aug.; occasional in summer.              Traill's Flycatcher (_E. t. trailli_), a slightly            browner bird is the Mississippi Valley form. N.            Ohio, common S.R., May 7-Sept. 10. Glen Ellyn,            quite common S.R., May 14-Sept. 19. S.E. Minn.,            common S.R., May 6-Aug. 10.    A rare recluse of the alders who, traveling silently between his summer  and his winter homes, makes few friends among men. Dwight describes its  call note as \"a single _pep_,\" and its song as _ee-zee-e-up_, resembling  that of the Acadian. The bird places the nest low down in the crotch of  one of the bushes among which it lives and lays 3-4 white, brown-spotted  eggs in June.      LEAST FLYCATCHER    _Empidonax minimus. Case 6, Fig. 44_              Smallest of the Flycatchers; like the Alder            Flycatcher its back is olive-brown rather than            olive-green; no evident yellow on the underparts.            L. 5-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from Iowa,            Pennsylvania and New Jersey to Canada; winters in            the tropics.              Washington, common T.V., Apl. 20-May 20; Aug.            13-Sept. 15. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl.            25-Aug. 26. Cambridge, very common S.R., May            1-Aug. 25. N.
