The difference in size between the brains of dogs belonging to large and  small breeds \"is something prodigious.\" \"Some dogs' brains are high and  rounded, while others are low, long, and narrow in front.\" In the latter,  \"the olfactory lobes are visible for about half their extent, when the  brain is seen from above, but they are wholly concealed by the hemispheres  in other breeds.\" (1/56. Dr. Burt Wilder 'American Assoc. Advancement of  Science' 1873 pages 236, 239.) The dog has properly six pairs of molar  teeth in the upper jaw, and seven in the lower; but several naturalists  have seen not rarely an additional pair in the upper jaw (1/57. Isid.  Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' 1832 tome 1 page 660, Gervais  'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' tome 2 1855 page 66. De Blainville  ('Osteographie, Canidae' page 137) has also seen an extra molar on both  sides.); and Professor Gervais says that there are dogs \"qui ont sept  paires de dents superieures et huit inferieures.\" De Blainville (1/58.  'Osteographie, Canidae' page 137.) has given full particulars on the  frequency of these deviations in the number of the teeth, and has shown  that it is not always the same tooth which is supernumerary. In short-  muzzled races, according to H. Muller (1/59. Wurzburger 'Medecin.  Zeitschrift' 1860 b. 1 s. 265.), the molar teeth stand obliquely, whilst in  long-muzzled races they are placed longitudinally, with open spaces between  them. The naked, so-called Egyptian or Turkish dog is extremely deficient  in its teeth (1/60. Mr. Yarrell in 'Proc. Zoological Soc.' October 8, 1833.  Mr. Waterhouse showed me a skull of one of these dogs, which had only a  single molar on each side and some imperfect incisors.),--sometimes having  none except one molar on each side; but this, though characteristic of the  breed, must be considered as a monstrosity. M. Girard (1/61. Quoted in 'The  Veterinary' London volume 8 page 415.), who seems to have attended closely  to the subject, says that the period of the appearance of the permanent  teeth differs in different dogs, being earlier in large dogs; thus the  mastiff assumes its adult teeth in four or five months, whilst in the  spaniel the period is sometimes more than seven or eight months. On the  other hand small dogs are mature, and the females have arrived at the best  age for breeding, when one year old, whereas large dogs \"are still in their  puppyhood at this time, and take fully twice as long to develop their  proportions.\" (1/62. This is quoted from Stonehenge, a great authority,  'The Dog' 1867 page 187.)    With respect to minor differences little need be said. Isidore Geoffroy has  shown (1/63. 'Hist. Nat. General' tome 3 page 448.) that in size some dogs  are six times as long (the tail being excluded) as others; and that the  height relatively to the length of the body varies from between one to two,  and one to nearly four. In the Scotch deer-hound there is a striking and  remarkable difference in the size of the male and female. (1/64. W. Scrope  'Art of Deer-Stalking' page 354.) Every one knows how the ears vary in size  in different breeds, and with their great development their muscles become  atrophied. Certain breeds of dogs are described as having a deep furrow  between the nostrils and lips. The caudal vertebrae, according to F.  Cuvier, on whose authority the two last statements rest, vary in number;  and the tail in English cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent. The  mammae vary from seven to ten in number; Daubenton, having examined twenty-  one dogs, found eight with five mammae on each side; eight with four on  each side; and the others with an unequal number on the two sides. (1/65.  Quoted by Col. Ham. Smith in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 79.) Dogs have  properly five toes in front and four behind, but a fifth toe is often  added; and F. Cuvier states that, when a fifth toe is present, a fourth  cuneiform bone is developed; and, in this case, sometimes the great  cuneiform bone is raised, and gives on its inner side a large articular  surface to the astragalus; so that even the relative connection of the  bones, the most constant of all characters, varies. These modifications,  however, in the feet of dogs are not important, because they ought to be  ranked, as De Blainville has shown (1/66. De Blainville 'Osteographie,  Canidae' page 134. F. Cuvier 'Annales du Museum' tome 18 page 342. In  regard to mastiffs, see Col. H. Smith 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 218. For  the Thibet mastiff, see Mr. Hodgson in 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal'  volume 1 1832 page 342.) as monstrosities. Nevertheless they are  interesting from being correlated with the size of the body, for they occur  much more frequently with mastiffs and other large breeds than with small  dogs. Closely allied varieties, however, sometimes differ in this respect;  thus Mr. Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the Thibet  mastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is not thus  characterised. The extent to which the skin is developed between the toes  varies much; but we shall return to this point. The degree to which the  various breeds differ in the perfection of their senses, dispositions, and  inherited habits is notorious to every one. The breeds present some  constitutional differences: the pulse, says Youatt (1/67. 'The Dog' 1845  page 186. With respect to diseases Youatt asserts (page 167) that the  Italian greyhound is \"strongly subject\" to polypi in the matrix or vagina.  The spaniel and pug (page 182) are most liable to bronchocele. The  liability to distemper (page 232) is extremely different in different  breeds. On the distemper, see also Col. Hutchinson on 'Dog Breaking' 1850  page 279.) \"varies materially according to the breed, as well as to the  size of the animal.\" Different breeds of dogs are subject in different  degrees to various diseases. They certainly become adapted to different  climates under which they have long existed. It is notorious that most of  our best European breeds deteriorate in India. (1/68. See 'Youatt on the  Dog' page 15; 'The Veterinary' London volume 11 page 235.) The Rev R.  Everest (1/69. 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 3 page 19.) believes  that no one has succeeded in keeping the Newfoundland dog long alive in  India; so it is, according to Lichtenstein (1/70. 'Travels' volume 2 page  15.), even at the Cape of Good Hope. The Thibet mastiff degenerates on the  plains of India, and can live only on the mountains. (1/71. Hodgson in  'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 1 page 342.) Lloyd (1/72. 'Field  Sports of the North of Europe' volume 2 page 165.) asserts that our  bloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried, and cannot withstand the cold of  the northern European forests.]    Seeing in how many characters the races of the dog differ from each other,  and remembering Cuvier's admission that their skulls differ more than do  those of the species of any natural genus, and bearing in mind how closely  the bones of wolves, jackals, foxes, and other Canidae agree, it is  remarkable that we meet with the statement, repeated over and over again,  that the races of the dog differ in no important characters. A highly  competent judge, Prof. Gervais (1/73. 'Hist. Nat. des Mammif.' 1855 tome 2  pages 66, 67.), admits \"si l'on prenait sans controle les alterations dont  chacun de ces organes est susceptible, on pourrait croire qu'il y a entre  les chiens domestiques des differences plus grandes que celles qui separent  ailleurs les especes, quelquefois meme les genres.\" Some of the differences  above enumerated are in one respect of comparatively little value, for they  are not characteristic of distinct breeds: no one pretends that such is the  case with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammae; the  additional digit is generally present with mastiffs, and some of the more  important differences in the skull and lower jaw are more or less  characteristic of various breeds. But we must not forget that the  predominant power of selection has not been applied in any of these cases;  we have variability in important parts, but the differences have not been  fixed by selection. Man cares for the form and fleetness of his greyhounds,  for the size of his mastiffs, and formerly for the strength of the jaw in  his bulldogs, etc.; but he cares nothing about the number of their molar  teeth or mammae or digits; nor do we know that differences in these organs  are correlated with, or owe their development to, differences in other  parts of the body about which man does care. Those who have attended to the  subject of selection will admit that, nature having given variability, man,  if he so chose, could fix five toes to the hinder feet of certain breeds of  dogs, as certainly as to the feet of his Dorking fowls: he could probably  fix, but with much more difficulty, an additional pair of molar teeth in  either jaw, in the same way as he has given additional horns to certain  breeds of sheep; if he wished to produce a toothless breed of dogs, having  the so-called Turkish dog with its imperfect teeth to work on, he could  probably do so, for he has succeeded in making hornless breeds of cattle  and sheep.    With respect to the precise causes and steps by which the several races of  dogs have come to differ so greatly from each other, we are, as in most  other cases, profoundly ignorant. We may attribute part of the difference  in external form and constitution to inheritance from distinct wild stocks,  that is to changes effected under nature before domestication. We must  attribute something to the crossing of the several domestic and natural  races. I shall, however, soon recur to the crossing of races. We have  already seen how often savages cross their dogs with wild native species;  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#11)"],[1,"scene was one of  damnation.    Then, grandly above Hell's din rose a mighty chorus. It was a heavenly  strain. Marguerite had not been spared the horror of execution; but  dead, the saints forgave her. In Heaven, as her soul ascended, they  sang:    \"Ascend, O trusting spirit! It was love which misled thee. Come, let  us wipe away thy tears. Come, come, and dwell forever among the  blest.\"    And thus Faust met his end, and Marguerite her reward for faith and  innocence.          BIZET      When Bizet wrote his music around Prosper Merimee's story of Carmen,  he reflected his familiarity with Spanish life and his long living in  the Pyrenees mountains. The character of Michaela is not found in the  novel, but the clever introduction of it into the opera story adds  greatly to dramatic effect, since the gentle and loving character is  in strong contrast with that of Carmen.    Bizet's name was Alexandre Cesar Leopold, and he was born on October  25, 1838, at Bougival, and died June 3, 1875. He with Charles Lecocq  won the Offenbach prize for the best operetta while Bizet was as yet a  youth, and from that time his art gained in strength and beauty. In  those days it was a reproach to suggest Wagner in musical composition,  but Bizet was accused of doing so. Thus he was handicapped by leaning  toward an unpopular school at the very start, but the great beauty of  his productions made their way in spite of all. He wrote, as his  second composition of importance, an opera around the novel of Scott's  Fair Maid of Perth--in French, La Jolie Fille de Perth--and this was  not a success, but that same opera survives through his Carmen. The  Bohemian dance in that opera was taken from it and interpolated into  the fourth act of Carmen.    Bizet died only three months after the production of this last opera,  but he had lived long enough to know that he had become one of the  world's great composers. He wrote exquisite pastoral music for  \"l'Arlesienne\"--whose story was adapted from Daudet's novel of that  name. In short, Bizet was the pioneer in a new school of French opera,  doing for it in a less measure what Wagner has finally done for the  whole world.    This genius left few anecdotes or personal reminiscences behind him.  The glory of his compositions alone seems to stand for his existence.

Halevy.    First sung at the Opera Comique, Paris, March 3, 1875.      I knew a boy who once said: \"That soldier thing in 'Carmen' is the  most awful bully thing to whistle a fellow ever heard; but if you  don't get it just right, it doesn't sound like anything,\" which was a  mistake, because if you don't get it \"just right\" it sounds something  awful. That boy's whistle was twenty per cent. better than his syntax,  but his judgment about music was pretty good, and we shall have the  soldier song in the very beginning, even before learning how it  happens, because it is the thing we are likely to recall, in a shadowy  sort of way, throughout the first act:    [Music:         With the guard on duty going         Marching onward, here we are!       Sound, trumpets merrily blowing!         Ta ra ta ta ta ra ta ta.         On we tramp, alert and ready,         Like young soldiers ev'ry one;--       Heads up and footfall steady,         Left! right! we're marching on!         See how straight our shoulders are,         Ev'ry breast is swell'd with pride,       Our arms all regular         Hanging down on either side.         With the guard on duty going,         Marching onward, here we are!       Sound, trumpets merrily blowing,         Ta ra ta ta ta ra ta ta!]    That is the way it goes, and this is the way it happens:      ACT I    Once upon a time there was a pretty girl named Michaela, and she was  as good as she was beautiful. She loved a corporal in the Spanish army  whose name was Don Jose. Now the corporal was a fairly good chap, but  he had been born thoughtless, and as a matter of fact he had lived  away from home for so long that he had half-forgotten his old mother  who lived a lonely life with Michaela.    One day, about noontime, the guard, waiting to be relieved by their  comrades, were on duty near the guard-house, which was situated in a  public square of Seville. As the soldiers sat about, or walked with  muskets over shoulders, their service was not especially wearisome,  because people were continually passing through the square, and  besides there was a cigarette factory on the other side of the  square, and when the factory hands tumbled out, about noon, there was  plenty of carousing and gaiety for an hour. Here in the square were  little donkeys with tinkling bells upon them, and donkeys carrying  packs upon their backs, and gentlemen in black velvet cloaks which  were thrown artistically over one shoulder, and with plumes on their  hats. Then, too, there were ragged folks who looked rather well,  nevertheless, since their rags were Spanish rags, and made a fine show  of bright colours.    Just as Morales, the officer of the guard, was finding the hot morning  rather slow, and wishing the factory bell would ring, and his brother  officer march his men in to relieve him, Michaela appeared. She had  come into the city from the home of Jose's mother, which was somewhere  near, in the hills. His old mother had become so lonely and worried,  not having heard from Jose for so long, that at last the girl had  undertaken to come down into the city, bearing a note from his mother,  and to seek him out at his barracks. She had inquired her way till she  found the square where the guard was quartered, and now, when she  entered it, Morales was the first to see her.    \"That is a pretty girl,\" Morales decided as he watched her. \"Seems to  be looking for some one--little strange in this part of the town,  probably. Can I do anything for you?\" he called to her, as she  approached.    \"I am looking for Don Jose, a soldier, if you know him----\"    \"Perfectly. He is corporal of the guard which is presently to relieve  us. If you wait here, you are certain to see him.\" Michaela thanked  him quietly, and went away. The soldiers were strange to her, and she  preferred to wait in another part of the square rather than where  they were idling. She had no sooner disappeared than the music of the  relief guard was heard in the distance. It was the soldiers' chorus: a  regular fife and drum affair. It came nearer, nearer, nearer, till it  arrived in full blast, fresh as a pippin, the herald of all that was  going to happen through four acts of opera. There was to be fighting  and smugglers: factory-girls in a row, and Carmen everywhere and  anywhere, all of the time.    With the new guard comes first the bugler and a fifer with a lot of  little ragged urchins tagging along behind; then comes Zuniga  strutting in, very much pleased with himself, and after him Don Jose,  the corporal, whom Michaela has come to town to see. The street boys  sing while the new guard lines up in front of the old one, and every  one takes up the song. It is the business of every one in opera to  sing about everything at any time. Thus the guard describes itself in  song:         On we tramp, alert and steady,         Like young soldiers, every one!       Head up, and footfall steady,         Left, right! we're marching on!         See how straight our shoulders are,--         Every breast is swelled with pride,       Our arms all regular--         Hanging down on either side.    There is not much poetry in this, but there is lots of vim, and the  new guard, as bright as a new tin whistle, has formed and the old  guard marched off during the singing. Meantime, while things have been  settling down, Morales has had a word with Don Jose.    \"A pretty girl is somewhere near here, looking for you, Jose. She  wore a blue gown and her hair is in a braid down her back; she's----\"    \"I know her; it is Michaela,\" Jose declares: and, with the sudden  knowledge that she is so near, and that she comes directly from his  old mother, he feels a longing for home, and realizes that he has been  none too thoughtful or kind toward those who love him. As everybody  finds himself in place, Zuniga points across to the cigarette factory.    \"Did you ever notice that there are often some tremendously pretty  girls over there?\" he asks of Jose.    \"Huh?\" Jose answers, abstractedly. Zuniga laughs.    \"You are thinking of the pretty girl Morales has just told you of,\" he  says. \"The girl with the blue petticoat and the braid down her back!\"    \"Well, why not? I love her,\" Jose answers shortly. He hunches his  musket a little higher and wheels about. He doesn't specially care to  talk of Michaela or his mother, with these young scamps who are as  thoughtless as himself: he has preserved so much of self-respect; but  before he can answer again the factory bell rings. Dinner time! Jose  stands looking across, as every one else does, while the factory crowd  begins to tumble out, helter-skelter. All come singing, and the girls  smoking cigarettes, a good many of them being gipsies, like Carmen.  They are dressed in all sorts of clothes from dirty silk petticoats,  up to self-respecting rags. Carmen is somewhere in the"]]]
