If the GUESTS have any respect for their HOST, or prefer a well-dressed  dinner to one that is spoiled, instead of coming half an hour after,  they will take care to make their appearance a quarter of an hour before  the time appointed.    The operations of the cook are governed by the clock; the moment the  roasts, &c. are ready, they must go to the table, if they are to be  eaten in perfection.    An invitation to come at FIVE o'clock seems to be generally understood  to mean _six_; FIVE PRECISELY, _half past five_; and NOT LATER THAN FIVE  (so that dinner may be on the table within five minutes after, allowing  this for the variation of watches), FIVE O'CLOCK EXACTLY.    Be it known to all loyal subjects of the empire of good-living, that the  COMMITTEE OF TASTE have unanimously resolved, that \"an invitation to  ETA. BETA. PI. must be in writing, and sent at least ten days before the  banquet; and must be answered in writing (as soon as possible after it  is received), within twenty-four hours at least,\" especially if it be  not accepted: then, in addition to the usual complimentary expressions  of thanks, &c. the best possible reasons must be assigned for the  non-acceptance, as a particular pre-engagement, or severe indisposition,  &c. Before the bearer of it delivers it, he should ascertain if the  person it is directed to is at home; if he is not, when he will be; and  if he is not in town, to bring the summons back.    Nothing can be more disobliging than a refusal which is not grounded on  some very strong and unavoidable cause,--except not coming at the  appointed hour;--\"according to the laws of conviviality, a certificate  from a sheriff's officer, a doctor, or an undertaker, are the only pleas  which are admissible. The duties which invitation imposes do not fall  only on the persons invited, but, like all other social duties, are  reciprocal.    \"As he who has accepted an invitation cannot disengage himself from it;  the master of the feast cannot put off the entertainment on any pretence  whatever. Urgent business, sickness, not even death itself, can dispense  with the obligation which he is under of giving the entertainment for  which he has sent out invitations, which have been accepted; for in the  extreme cases of compulsory absence, or death, his place may be filled  by his friend or executor.\"--_Vide le Manuel des Amphitryons_, 8vo.  _Paris_, 1808; and _Cours Gastronomique_, 1809; to which the reader is  referred for farther instructions.    It is the least punishment that a blundering, ill-bred booby can  receive, who comes half an hour after the time he was bidden, to find  the soup removed, and the fish cold: moreover, for such an offence, let  him also be _mulcted_ in a pecuniary penalty, to be applied to the FUND  FOR THE BENEFIT OF DECAYED COOKS. This is the least punishment that can  be inflicted on one whose silence, or violation of an engagement, tends  to paralyze an entertainment, and to draw his friend into useless  expense.    BOILEAU, the French satirist, has a shrewd observation on this subject.  \"I have always been punctual at the hour of dinner,\" says the bard; \"for  I knew, that all those whom I kept waiting at that provoking interval,  would employ those unpleasant moments to sum up all my faults.--BOILEAU  is indeed a man of genius, a very honest man; but that dilatory and  procrastinating way he has got into, would mar the virtues of an angel.\"    There are some who seldom keep an appointment: we can assure them they  as seldom \"'scape without whipping,\" and exciting those murmurs which  inevitably proceed from the best-regulated stomachs, when they are  empty, and impatient to be filled.    The most amiable animals when hungry become ill-tempered: our best  friends employ the time they are kept waiting, in recollecting and  repeating any real faults we have, and attributing to us a thousand  imaginary ones.    Ill-bred beings, who indulge their own caprice, regardless how they  wound the feelings of others, if they possess brilliant and useful  talents, may occasionally be endured as convenient tools; but deceive  themselves sadly, even though they possess all the wisdom, and all the  wit in the world, if they fancy they can ever be esteemed as friends.    Wait for no one: as soon as the clock strikes, say grace, and begin the  business of the day,        \"And good digestion wait on appetite,      And health on both.\"      MANNERS MAKE THE MAN.    Good manners have often made the fortune of many, who have had nothing  else to recommend them:    Ill manners have as often marred the hope of those who have had every  thing else to advance them.    These regulations may appear a little rigorous to those phlegmatic  philosophers,        \"Who, past all pleasures, damn the joys of sense,      With rev'rend dulness and grave impotence,\"    and are incapable of comprehending the importance (especially when many  are invited) of a truly hospitable entertainment: but genuine  _connoisseurs_ in the science of good cheer will vote us thanks for our  endeavours to initiate well-disposed _amateurs_.      CARVING.    Ceremony does not, in any thing, more commonly and completely triumph  over comfort, than in the administration of \"the honours of the table.\"    Those who serve out the loaves and fishes seldom seem to understand that  he is the best carver who fills the plates of the greatest number of  guests, in the least portion of time.    To effect this, fill the plates and send them round, instead of asking  each individual if they choose soup, fish, &c. or what particular part  they prefer; for, as they cannot all be choosers, you will thus escape  making any invidious distinctions.    A dexterous CARVER[43-*] (especially if he be possessed with that  determined enemy to ceremony and sauce, a keen appetite,) will help half  a dozen people in half the time one of your would-be-thought polite  folks wastes in making civil faces, &c. to a single guest.    It would save a great deal of time, &c. if POULTRY, especially large  turkeys and geese, were sent to table ready cut up. (No. 530.*)    FISH that is fried should be previously divided into such portions as  are fit to help at table. (See No. 145.)    A prudent carver will cut fair,[43-+] observe an equitable distribution  of the dainties he is serving out, and regulate his helps, by the  proportion which his dish bears to the number he has to divide it among,  taking into this reckoning the _quantum_ of appetite the several guests  are presumed to possess.        \"Study their genius, caprices, _gout_--      They, in return, may haply study you:      Some wish a pinion, some prefer a leg,      Some for a merry-thought, or sidesbone beg,      The wings of fowls, then slices of the round      The trail of woodcock, of codfish the sound.      Let strict impartiality preside,      Nor freak, nor favour, nor affection guide.\"        _From the_ BANQUET.    The guest who wishes to ensure a hearty welcome, and frequent invitation  to the board of hospitality, may calculate that the \"easier he is  pleased, the oftener he will be invited.\" Instead of unblushingly  demanding of the fair hostess that the prime \"_tit-bit_\" of every dish  be put on your plate, receive (if not with pleasure, or even content)  with the liveliest expressions of thankfulness whatever is presented to  you, and forget not to praise the cook, and the same shall be reckoned  unto you even as the praise of the mistress.    The invalid or the epicure, when he dines out, to save trouble to his  friends, may carry with him a portable MAGAZINE OF TASTE. (See No. 462.)    \"If he does not like his fare, he may console himself with the  reflection, that he need not expose his mouth to the like mortification  again: mercy to the feelings of the mistress of the mansion will forbid  his then appearing otherwise than absolutely delighted with it,  notwithstanding it may be his extreme antipathy.\"    \"If he likes it ever so little, he will find occasion to congratulate  himself on the advantage his digestive organs will derive from his  making a moderate dinner, and consolation from contemplating the double  relish he is creating for the following meal, and anticipating the (to  him) rare and delicious zest of (that best sauce) good appetite, and an  unrestrained indulgence of his gormandizing fancies at the chop-house he  frequents.\"    \"Never intrust a _cook-teaser_ with the important office of CARVER, or  place him within reach of _a sauce-boat_. These chop-house cormorants,  who        'Critique your wine, and analyze your meat,      Yet on plain pudding deign at home to eat,'    are, generally, tremendously officious in serving out the loaves and  fishes of other people; for, under the notion of appearing exquisitely  amiable, and killingly agreeable to the guests, they are ever on the  watch to distribute themselves the dainties which it is the peculiar  part of the master and mistress to serve out, and is to them the most  pleasant part of the business of the banquet: the pleasure of helping  their friends is the gratification, which is their reward for the  trouble they have had in preparing the feast. Such gentry are the terror  of all good housewives: to obtain their favourite cut they will so  unmercifully mangle your joints, that a dainty dog would hardly get a  meal from them after; which, managed by the considerative hands of an  old housekeeper, would furnish a decent dinner for a large  family.\"--Vide "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#11)"],[1,"their boat fast to one end of the net  and drift along with it.    As we came upon the fleet of law-breaking fishermen, each boat two or  three hundred yards from its neighbors, and boats and nets dotting the  river as far as we could see, Charley said:    \"I've only one regret, lad, and that is that I haven't a thousand arms  so as to be able to catch them all. As it is, we'll only be able to  catch one boat, for while we are tackling that one it will be up nets  and away with the rest.\"    As we drew closer, we observed none of the usual flurry and  excitement which our appearance invariably produced. Instead, each  boat lay quietly by its net, while the fishermen favored us with not  the slightest attention.    \"It's curious,\" Charley muttered. \"Can it be they don't recognize us?\"    I said that it was impossible, and Charley agreed; yet there was a  whole fleet, manned by men who knew us only too well, and who took no  more notice of us than if we were a hay scow or a pleasure yacht.    This did not continue to be the case, however, for as we bore down  upon the nearest net, the men to whom it belonged detached their boat  and rowed slowly toward the shore. The rest of the boats showed no  sign of uneasiness.    \"That's funny,\" was Charley's remark. \"But we can confiscate the net,  at any rate.\"    We lowered sail, picked up one end of the net, and began to heave it  into the boat. But at the first heave we heard a bullet zip-zipping  past us on the water, followed by the faint report of a rifle. The men  who had rowed ashore were shooting at us. At the next heave a second  bullet went zipping past, perilously near. Charley took a turn around  a pin and sat down. There were no more shots. But as soon as he began  to heave in, the shooting recommenced.    \"That settles it,\" he said, flinging the end of the net overboard.  \"You fellows want it worse than we do, and you can have it.\"    We rowed over toward the next net, for Charley was intent on finding  out whether or not we were face to face with an organized defiance. As  we approached, the two fishermen proceeded to cast off from their net  and row ashore, while the first two rowed back and made fast to the  net we had abandoned. And at the second net we were greeted by rifle  shots till we desisted and went on to the third, where the manoeuvre  was again repeated.    Then we gave it up, completely routed, and hoisted sail and started on  the long wind-ward beat back to Benicia. A number of Sundays went by,  on each of which the law was persistently violated. Yet, short of an  armed force of soldiers, we could do nothing. The fishermen had hit  upon a new idea and were using it for all it was worth, while there  seemed no way by which we could get the better of them.    About this time Neil Partington happened along from the Lower Bay,  where he had been for a number of weeks. With him was Nicholas, the  Greek boy who had helped us in our raid on the oyster pirates, and  the pair of them took a hand. We made our arrangements carefully. It  was planned that while Charley and I tackled the nets, they were to be  hidden ashore so as to ambush the fishermen who landed to shoot at us.    It was a pretty plan. Even Charley said it was. But we reckoned not  half so well as the Greeks. They forestalled us by ambushing Neil and  Nicholas and taking them prisoners, while, as of old, bullets whistled  about our ears when Charley and I attempted to take possession of the  nets. When we were again beaten off, Neil Partington and Nicholas were  released. They were rather shamefaced when they put in an appearance,  and Charley chaffed them unmercifully. But Neil chaffed back,  demanding to know why Charley's imagination had not long since  overcome the difficulty.    \"Just you wait; the idea'll come all right,\" Charley promised.    \"Most probably,\" Neil agreed. \"But I'm afraid the salmon will be  exterminated first, and then there will be no need for it when it does  come.\"    Neil Partington, highly disgusted with his adventure, departed for the  Lower Bay, taking Nicholas with him, and Charley and I were left to  our own resources. This meant that the Sunday fishing would be left to  itself, too, until such time as Charley's idea happened along. I  puzzled my head a good deal to find out some way of checkmating the  Greeks, as also did Charley, and we broached a thousand expedients  which on discussion proved worthless.    The fishermen, on the other hand, were in high feather, and their  boasts went up and down the river to add to our discomfiture. Among  all classes of them we became aware of a growing insubordination. We  were beaten, and they were losing respect for us. With the loss of  respect, contempt began to arise. Charley began to be spoken of as the  \"olda woman,\" and I received my rating as the \"pee-wee kid.\" The  situation was fast becoming unbearable, and we knew that we should  have to deliver a stunning stroke at the Greeks in order to regain the  old-time respect in which we had stood.    Then one morning the idea came. We were down on Steamboat Wharf, where  the river steamers made their landings, and where we found a group of  amused long-shoremen and loafers listening to the hard-luck tale of a  sleepy-eyed young fellow in long sea-boots. He was a sort of amateur  fisherman, he said, fishing for the local market of Berkeley. Now  Berkeley was on the Lower Bay, thirty miles away. On the previous  night, he said, he had set his net and dozed off to sleep in the  bottom of the boat.    The next he knew it was morning, and he opened his eyes to find his  boat rubbing softly against the piles of Steamboat Wharf at Benicia.  Also he saw the river steamer _Apache_ lying ahead of him, and a  couple of deck-hands disentangling the shreds of his net from the  paddle-wheel. In short, after he had gone to sleep, his fisherman's  riding light had gone out, and the _Apache_ had run over his net.  Though torn pretty well to pieces, the net in some way still remained  foul, and he had had a thirty-mile tow out of his course.    Charley nudged me with his elbow. I grasped his thought on the  instant, but objected:    \"We can't charter a steamboat.\"    \"Don't intend to,\" he rejoined. \"But let's run over to Turner's  Shipyard. I've something in my mind there that may be of use to us.\"    And over we went to the shipyard, where Charley led the way to the  _Mary Rebecca_, lying hauled out on the ways, where she was being  cleaned and overhauled. She was a scow-schooner we both knew well,  carrying a cargo of one hundred and forty tons and a spread of canvas  greater than any other schooner on the bay.    \"How d'ye do, Ole,\" Charley greeted a big blue-shirted Swede who was  greasing the jaws of the main gaff with a piece of pork rind.    Ole grunted, puffed away at his pipe, and went on greasing. The  captain of a bay schooner is supposed to work with his hands just as  well as the men.    Ole Ericsen verified Charley's conjecture that the _Mary Rebecca_, as  soon as launched, would run up the San Joaquin River nearly to  Stockton for a load of wheat. Then Charley made his proposition, and  Ole Ericsen shook his head.    \"Just a hook, one good-sized hook,\" Charley pleaded.    \"No, Ay tank not,\" said Ole Ericsen. \"Der _Mary Rebecca_ yust hang up  on efery mud-bank with that hook. Ay don't want to lose der _Mary  Rebecca_. She's all Ay got.\"    \"No, no,\" Charley hurried to explain. \"We can put the end of the hook  through the bottom from the outside, and fasten it on the inside with  a nut. After it's done its work, why, all we have to do is to go down  into the hold, unscrew the nut, and out drops the hook. Then drive a  wooden peg into the hole, and the _Mary Rebecca_ will be all right  again.\"    Ole Ericsen was obstinate for a long time; but in the end, after we  had had dinner with him, he was brought round to consent.    \"Ay do it, by Yupiter!\" he said, striking one huge fist into the palm  of the other hand. \"But yust hurry you up with der hook. Der _Mary  Rebecca_ slides into der water to-night.\"    It was Saturday, and Charley had need to hurry. We headed for the  shipyard blacksmith shop, where, under Charley's directions, a most  generously curved hook of heavy steel was made. Back we hastened to  the _Mary Rebecca_. Aft of the great centre-board case, through what  was properly her keel, a hole was bored. The end of the hook was  inserted from the outside, and Charley, on the inside, screwed the nut  on tightly. As it stood complete, the hook projected over a foot  beneath the bottom of the schooner. Its curve was something like the  curve of a sickle, but deeper.    In the late afternoon the _Mary Rebecca_ was launched, and  preparations were finished for the start up-river next morning.  Charley and Ole intently studied the evening sky for signs of wind,  for without a good breeze our project was doomed to failure. They  agreed that there were all the signs of a stiff westerly wind--not the  ordinary afternoon sea-breeze, but a half-gale, which even then was  springing up.    Next morning found their predictions verified. The sun was shining  brightly, but something more than a half-gale was shrieking up the  Carquinez Straits, and the _Mary Rebecca_ got under way with two reefs  in her mainsail and one in her foresail. We found it quite rough in  the Straits and in Suisun Bay; but as the water grew more land-locked  it became calm, though without let-up in the wind.    Off Ship Island Light the reefs were shaken out, and at Charley's  suggestion a big fisherman's staysail was made all ready for hoisting,  and the main-topsail, bunched into a cap at the masthead, was  overhauled so that it could be set on an instant's notice.    We were tearing along, wing-and-wing, before the wind, foresail to  starboard and mainsail to port, as we came upon the salmon fleet.  There they were, boats and nets, as on that first Sunday when they had  bested us, strung"]]]
