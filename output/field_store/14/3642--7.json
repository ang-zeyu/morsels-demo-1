Iffen we  got took sick, we had doctor treatment, too. Iffen a hand took sick in  the field with a misery, they was carried to their quarters and Massa or  Miss Mary would give them a dose of epecac and make them vomit and would  sen' for the doctor. They wouldn' fool none iffen one of us took sick,  but would clean us out and take care of us till we was well.    \"There was mighty little whippin' goin' on at our place, 'cause Massa  Lewis and Miss Mary treated us good. They wasn't no overseer goin' to  whip, 'cause Massa wouldn' 'low him to. Le's see, I don' rec'lec' more  than two whippin's I see anyone git from Massa, and that has been so  long ago I don' rec'lec' what they was for.    \"When the War done come 'long it sho' changed things, and we heerd this  and that, but we didn' know much what it was about. Then one day Massa  Lewis had all the wagons loaded with food and chairs and beds and other  things from the house and our quarters, and I heerd him say we was  movin' to Polk County, way over in Texas. I know it took us a long time  to git there, and when we did I never see so much woods. It sho' was  diff'rent from the plantation.    \"I had to work in the fields, same as the res', and we stayed there  three years and made three crops of cotton, but not so much as on our  old place, 'cause there wasn't so much clearin'. Then one day Massa  Lewis tol' us we was free, jus' as free as he was--jus' like you take  the bridle offen a hoss and turn him loose. We jus' looked 'roun as  iffen we hadn' good sense. We didn' have nothin' nor nowhere to go, and  Massa Lewis say iffen we finish makin' de crop, he would take us back to  Opelousas and give us a place to stay and feed us. So after pickin' we  goes back and when we git there we sees where those rascal Yankees  'stroyed everything--houses burned, sugar kettles broke up. It looked  mighty bad.    \"Massa Lewis hadn' no money, but he fixed us up a place to stay and give  us what he could to eat, but things was mighty hard for a while. I know  pappy used to catch rabbits and take them to town and sell them or trade  them for somethin' to eat, and you know that wasn't much, 'cause you  can't git much for a little ol' rabbit.    \"Then the Provo' Marshal, that was his name, give us a order for things  to put in a crop with and to live till we made the crop. 'Course, I  guess we wasn' as bad off as some, 'cause white folks knew we was Massa  Lewis' folks and didn' bother us none.    Then I got married to John Bell, and it was a scripture weddin', too. He  died 28 years ago, but I has stayed married to him ever since. We had  thirteen chillen, but they is all dead now 'cept four, but they was  raised up right and they is mighty good to they ol' mammy.          420114      [Illustration: Edgar and Minerva Bendy]           EDGAR BENDY, 90 odd years, was the slave of Henry Bendy, of       Woodville, Texas, has to make an effort to remember and is forced       to seek aid from his wife, Minerva, at certain points in his story.       Edgar has lived in Woodville all his life.      \"I's a good size' boy when de war gwine on and I seed de soldiers come  right here in Woodville. A big bunch of dem come through and dey have  cannons with dem. My marster he didn't go to war, 'cause he too old, I  guess.    \"I's born right here and done live hereabouts every since. Old man Henry  Bendy, he my marster and he run de store here in Woodville and have de  farm, too. I didn't do nothin' 'cept nuss babies. I jes' jump dem up and  down and de old marster hire me out to nuss other white folks chillen,  big and little.    \"My daddy name' Jack Crews and my mammy was Winnie. Both of dem worked  on de farm and I never seed dem much. I didn't have no house of my own,  'cause de marster, he give me de room in he house. He have lots of  slaves and 'bout 100 acres in cult'vation. He gave dem plenty to eat and  good homespun clothes to wear. He was mighty good.    \"Marster have de plank house and all de things in it was home-made. De  cook was a old cullud woman and I eat at de kitchen table and have de  same what de white folks eats. Us has lots of meat, deer meat and possum  and coon and sich, and us sets traps for birds.    \"Dey ain't nothin' better dat go in de wood dan de big, fat possum. Dey  git fat on black haws and acorns and chinquapin and sich. Chinquapin is  good for people to eat and to roast. I used to be plumb give up to be de  best hunter in Tyler and in de whole country. I kilt more deer dan any  other man in de county and I been guide for all de big men what comes  here to hunt. My wife, Minerva, she used to go huntin' with me.    \"I kep' on huntin' and huntin' till de Jack-a-my-lanterns git after me.  Dat a light you sees all 'round you. Dey follow all 'long and dey stop  you still. Den one time it git all over me. Come like de wind, blow,  blow, and come jes' like fire all on my arm and my clothes and things. When  dat git after me I quit huntin' at nighttime and ain't been huntin'  since.    \"One time I fishin' on de creek and I ain't got no gun, and I look up  and dere a big, wild cat. He never pay me no mind, no more dan nothin',  but dat ain't made no diff'rence to me. I jes' flew in dat creek!    \"I used to belong to de lodge but when I git so old I couldn't pay my  jews, I git unfinancial and I ain't a member no more.          420174           MINERVA BENDY, 83, was born a slave to Lazarus Goolsby, Henry Co.       Alabama, who brought her to Texas when she was five. They settled       near Woodville, where Minerva still lives.      \"My earlies' 'membrance was de big, white sandy road what lead 'way from  de house. It was clean and white and us chillen love to walk in de soft,  hot sand. Dat in Henry County, Alabama, where I's born and my old  marster was Lazarus Goolsby and he have de big plantation with lots of  nigger folks. I 'member jus' as good as yesterday wigglin' my toes in  dat sandy road and runnin' 'way to de grits mill where dey grind de  meal. Dat have de big water wheel dat sing and squeak as it go 'round.    \"Aunt Mary, she make all us little chillen sleep in de heat of de day  under de big, spreadin' oak tree in de yard. My mama have 17 chillen.  Her name Dollie and my daddy name Herd.    \"I's jus' a little chile in dem days and I stay in de house with de  white folks. Dey raise me a pet in de family. Missus Goolsby, she have  two gals and dey give me to de oldest. When she die dey put me in de bed  with her but iffen I knowed she dyin' dey wouldn't been able to cotch  me. She rub my head and tell her papa and mama, 'I's gwine 'way but I  wants you promise you ain't never whip my little nigger.' Dey never did.    \"I's jus' 'bout five year old when us make de trip to Texas. Us come  right near Woodville and make de plantation. It a big place and dey  raise corn and cotton and cane. We makes our own sugar and has many as  six kettle on de furnace at one time. Dey raise dey tobacco, too. I's  sick and a old man he say he make me tobacco medicine and dey dry de  leafs and make dem sweet like sugar and feed me like candy.    \"I 'member old marster say war broke out and Capt. Collier's men was  a-drillin' right dere south of Woodville. All de wives and chillen watch  dem drill. Dey was lots of dem, but I couldn't count.

Zabud, he git wounded, no he git kilt, and Addison he  git wounded. I worry den, 'cause I ain't see no reason for dem to have  to die.    \"After us free dey turn us loose in de woods and dat de bad time, 'cause  most us didn't know where to turn.

In 1867 she married Cal Benjamin and they       settled in Corsicana, Texas, where Sarah now lives.      \"I is Sarah Benjamin and is 82 year old, 'cause my mammy told me I's  born in 1855 in Clavin Parish in Louisiana.

The Black Hills of South Dakota, although lying  out in the plains, are an example of the same kind of structure and  really belong to the cordillera. In them the layers of the earth's crust  have been bent up in the form of a great dome. The dome structure, to be  sure, has now been largely destroyed, for erosion has long been active.  The result is that the harder strata form a series of concentric ridges,  while between them are ring-shaped valleys, one of which is so level and  unbroken that it is known to the Indians as the \"race-course.\" In  other parts of the cordillera great masses of rock have been pushed  horizontally upon the tops of others. In Montana, for example, the  strata of the plains have been bent down and overridden by those of  the mountains. These are only a few of the countless forms of breaking,  faulting, and crumpling which have given to the cordillera an almost  infinite variety of scenery.    The work of mountain building is still active in the western cordillera,  as is evident from such an event as the San Francisco earthquake. In the  Owens Valley region in southern California the gravelly beaches of old  lakes are rent by fissures made within a few years by earthquakes. In  other places fresh terraces on the sides of the valley mark the lines of  recent earth movements, while newly formed lakes lie in troughs at  their base. These Owens Valley movements of the crust are parts of the  stupendous uplift which has raised the Sierra Nevada to heights of over  14,000 feet a few miles to the west. Along the fault line at the base  of the mountains there runs for over 9.50 miles the world's longest  aqueduct, which was built to relieve Los Angeles from the danger of  drought. It is a strange irony of fate that so delicate and so vital  an artery of civilization should be forced to lie where a renewal of  earthquake movements may break it at any time. Yet there was no other  place to put it, for in spite of man's growing control of nature he  was forced to follow the topography of the region in which he lived and  labored.    On the southern side of the Mohave Desert a little to the east of where  the Los Angeles aqueduct crosses the mountains in its southward course,  the record of an earthquake is preserved in unique fashion. The steep  face of a terrace is covered with trees forty or fifty years old. Near  the base the trees are bent in peculiar fashion. Their lower portions  stand at right angles to the steeply sloping face of the terrace, but  after a few feet the trunks bend upward and stand vertically. Clearly  when these trees were young the terrace was not there. Then an  earthquake came. One block of the earth's crust was dropped down while  another was raised up. Along the dividing line a terrace was formed. The  trees that happened to stand along the line were tilted and left in a  slanting position on the sloping surface between the two parts of the  earth's crust. They saw no reason to stop growing, but, turning their  tips toward the sky, they bravely pushed upward. Thus they preserve in a  striking way the record of this recent movement of the earth's crust.    Volcanoes as well as earth movements have occurred on a grand scale  within a few hundred years in the cordillera. Even where there is today  no visible volcanic activity, recent eruptions have left traces as  fresh as if they had occurred but yesterday. On the borders of the Grand  Canyon of the Colorado one can see not only fresh cones of volcanic  ash but lava which has poured over the edges of the cliffs and hardened  while in the act of flowing. From Orizaba and Popocatepetl in Mexico  through Mount San Francisco in Arizona, Lassen Peak and Mount Shasta  in California, Mount Rainier with its glaciers in the Cascade Range of  Washington, and Mount Wrangell in Alaska, the cordillera contains an  almost unbroken chain of great volcanoes. All are either active at  present or have been active within very recent times. In 1912 Mount  Katmai, near the northwestern end of the volcanic chain, erupted so  violently that it sent dust around the whole world. The presence of the  dust caused brilliant sunsets second only to those due to Krakatoa  in 1883. It also cut off so much sunlight that the effect was felt in  measurements made by the Smithsonian Institution in the French provinces  of North Africa. In earlier times, throughout the length of the  cordillera great masses of volcanic material were poured out to form  high plateaus like those of southern Mexico or of the Columbia River in  Oregon. In Utah some of these have been lifted up so that heavy caps of  lava now form isolated sheets topping lofty plateaus. There the lowland  shepherds drive their sheep in summer and live in absolute isolation for  months at a time. There, as everywhere, the cordillera bears the marks  of mountains in the making, while the mountains of eastern America bear  the marks of those that were made when the world was young.    The geysers and hot springs of the Yellowstone are another proof of  recent volcanic activity. They owe their existence to hot rocks which  lie only a little way below the surface and which not long ago were  molten lava. The terraces and platforms built by the geysers are another  evidence that the cordillera is a region where the surface of the earth  is still being shaped into new forms by forces acting from within. The  physical features of the country are still in process of construction.    In spite of the importance of the constructive forces which are still  building up the mountains, much of the finest scenery of the cordillera  is due to the destructive forces of erosion. The majestic Columbia  Canyon, like others of its kind, is the work of running water. Glaciers  also have done their part. During the glacial period the forces which  control the paths of storms did not give to the cordillera region such  an abundance of snow as was sifted down upon Laurentia. Therefore no  such huge continental glaciers have flowed out over millions of square  miles of lower country. Nevertheless among the mountains themselves the  ice gouged and scraped and smoothed and at its lower edges deposited  great moraines. Its work today makes the cliffs and falls of the  Yosemite one of the world's most famous bits of scenery. This scenery  is young and its beauty will pass in a short time as geology counts the  years, for in natural scenery as in human life it is youth that makes  beauty. The canyons, waterfalls, and geysers of the cordillera share  their youth with the lakes, waterfalls, and rapids due to recent  glaciation in the east. Nevertheless, though youth is the condition of  most striking beauty, maturity and old age are the condition of greatest  usefulness. The young cordillera with its mountains still in the making  can support only a scanty population, whereas the old eastern mountains,  with the lines of long life engraved upon every feature, open their arms  to man and let him live and prosper.    It is not enough that we should picture merely the four divisions of the  land of our continent. We must see how the land meets the sea. In low  latitudes in both the Old World and the New, the continents have tended  to emerge farther and farther from the sea during recent geological  times. Hence on the eastern side of both North and South America from  New Jersey to Brazil the ocean is bordered for the most part by coastal  plains, uplifted from the sea only a short time ago. On the mountainous  western side of both continents, however, the sea bottom shelves  downward so steeply that its emergence does not give rise to a plain  but merely to a steep slope on which lie a series of old beaches several  hundred and even one thousand feet above the present shore line. Such  conditions are not favorable to human progress. The coastal plains  produced by uplift of the land may be fertile and may furnish happy  homes for man, but they do not permit ready access to the sea because  they have no harbors. The chief harbor of Mexico at Vera Cruz is merely  a little nick in the coast-line and could never protect a great fleet,  even with the help of its breakwater. Where an enterprising city like  Los Angeles lies on the uplifted Pacific coast, it must spend millions  in wresting a harbor from the very jaws of the sea.    In high latitudes in all parts of the world the land has recently been  submerged beneath the sea. In some places, especially those like the  coasts of Virginia and central California which lie in middle latitudes,  a recent slight submergence has succeeded a previous large emergence.  Wherever such sinking of the land has taken place, it has given rise to  countless bays, gulfs, capes, islands, and fiords. The ocean water has  entered the valleys and has drowned their lower parts. It has surrounded  the bases of hills and left them as islands; it has covered low valleys  and has created long sounds where traffic may pass with safety even in  great storms. Though much land has thus been lost which would be good  for agriculture, commerce has been wonderfully stimulated. Through Long  Island Sound there pass each day hundreds of boats which again and again  would suffer distress and loss if they were not protected from the open  sea. It is no accident that of the eight largest metropolitan districts  in the United States five have grown up on the shores of deep inlets  which are due to the drowning of valleys.    Nor must the value of scenery be forgotten in a survey such as this.  Year by year we are learning that in this restless, strenuous American  life of ours vacations are essential. We are learning, too, that the  love of beauty is one of Nature's greatest healers. Regions like the  coast of Maine and Puget Sound, where rugged land and life-giving ocean  interlock, are worth"]]]
