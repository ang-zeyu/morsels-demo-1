As  we had our boats at the stern well manned, we thought we should catch  the canoe. The boats chased for more than two hours, and at last the  caravel made another tack, but could not fetch the canoe. As the people  in the canoe saw they were closely pressed by the caravel and the boats,  they all jumped into the sea, their number being about seventy men; the  distance from the shore being nearly two leagues. Following them in the  boats, during the whole day, we were unable to capture more than two,  all the rest escaping on shore. Only four boys remained in the canoe,  who were not of their tribe, but prisoners from some other land. They  had been castrated, and were all without the virile member, and with  the scars fresh, at which we wondered much. Having taken them on board,  they told us by signs that they had been castrated to be eaten. We then  knew that the people in the canoe belonged to a tribe called _Cambali_,  very fierce men who eat human flesh. We came with the ship, towing the  canoe astern, approaching the land, and anchored at a distance of half  a league. We saw a great number of people on the beach, so we went on  shore with the boats, taking with us the two men we had captured. When we  came near all the people fled into the wood. So we released one of our  prisoners, giving him many signs that we wanted to be their friends. He  did what we wanted very well, and brought back all the people with him,  numbering about 400 men and many women, and they came unarmed to the  boats. A good understanding was established with them; we released the  other prisoner, sent to the ships for their canoe, and restored it to  them. This canoe was twenty-six _paces_ long, and two _braccia_[89]  in width, all dug out of a single tree, and very well worked. When they  had hauled it up and put it in a secure place, they all fled, and would  not have anything more to do with us; which seemed a barbarous act,  and we judged them to be a faithless and ill-conditioned people. We saw  a little gold, which they wear in their ears.    We departed and entered the bay, where we found so many people that  it was wonderful. We made friends with them, and many of us went with  them to their villages in great security. In this place we collected  150 pearls, which they gave us for a small bell, and a little gold was  given to us for nothing. In this land we found that they drank wine made  from their fruits and seeds, like beer, both white and red. The best was  made from plums,[90] and it was very good. We ate a great many of them,  as they were in season. It is a very good fruit, pleasant to the taste,  and wholesome for the body. The land abounds in their articles of food,  and the people are of good manners, and the most peaceful we have yet met  with. We were seventeen days in this port, enjoying it very much, and  every day new people from the interior came to see us, wondering at our  faces and the whiteness of our skins, at our clothes and arms, and at the  shape and size of our ships. From these people we had tidings that there  was another tribe to the westward who were their enemies, and who had  an immense quantity of pearls. Those which they possessed had been taken  in their wars. They told us how they were fished, and in what manner the  pearls were born, and we found their information to be correct, as your  Magnificence will hear.    We left this port and sailed along the coast, always seeing people on  the beach, and at the end of many days we came to in a port, by reason of  the necessity for repairing one of our ships, which made much water. Here  we found many people, but were unable, either by force or persuasion, to  establish any intercourse with them. When we went on shore they opposed  the landing fiercely, and when they could do no more they fled into the  woods and did not wait for us. Seeing that they were such barbarians we  departed thence, and, sailing onwards, we came in sight of an island  which was fifteen leagues from the land. We decided upon going to see  whether it was inhabited. We found on it the most bestial and the most  brutal race that has ever been seen, and they were of this kind. They  were very brutish in appearance and gesture, and they had their mouths  full of the leaves of a green herb, which they continually chewed like  beasts, so that they could hardly speak; and each had round his neck  two dry gourds, one full of that herb which they had in their mouths,  and the other of white flour that appeared to be powdered lime. From  time to time they put in the powder with a spindle which they kept wet  in the mouth. Then they put stuff into their mouths from both, powdering  the herb already in use. They did this with much elaboration; and the  thing seemed wonderful, for we could not understand the secret, or with  what object they did it.[91]    These people, when they saw us, came to us with much familiarity, as  if we had formed friendship with them. Walking with them on the beach  and talking, being desirous of drinking fresh water, they made signs  that they had none, and offered their herb and powder; from which we  concluded that the island was ill-provided with water, and that they  kept this herb in their mouths to keep off thirst. We walked over the  island for a day and a half, without finding a spring of water, and  we saw that the water they drank was what had fallen during the night  on certain leaves which looked like ass's ears, and held the water,  and of this they drank. It was excellent water; and these leaves are  not found in many places. They had no kind of meat,[92] and no roots,  as on the mainland. They were sustained by fish caught in the sea,  of which they had great abundance, and they were very good fishermen.  They gave us many turtles, and many large and excellent fish. Their women  did not have the herb in their mouths like the men, but they all carried  a gourd with water, from which they drank. They have no villages nor  houses, but merely live under bowers of leaves, which shade them from  the sun, though not from the rain. But I believe that it seldom rains  on that island. When they are fishing out at sea they all have a very  large leaf, and of such width that it forms a shade. As the sun rises,  so they raise the leaf, and thus they protect themselves from the sun.    The island contains many animals of various sorts, and much water in  swamps, and seeing that it offered no profit whatever, we departed and  went to another island. We found that this other island was inhabited by  very tall people. We landed to see whether there was any fresh water,  and not thinking it was inhabited, as we had not seen anyone, we came  upon very large foot-marks in the sand, as we were walking along the  beach. We judged that if the other measurements were in proportion to  those of their feet, they must be very tall. Going in search, we came  into a road which led inland. There were nine of us. Judging that there  could not be many inhabitants, as the island was small, we walked over  it to see what sort of people they were. When we had gone[93] about a  league we saw five huts, which appeared to be uninhabited, in a valley,  and we went to them. But we only found five women, two old, and three  children of such lofty stature that, for the wonder of the thing, we  wanted to keep them. When they saw us they were so frightened that they  had not the power to run away. The two old women began to invite us with  words, and to set before us many things, and took us into a hut. They  were taller than a large man who may well be tall, such as was Francesco  degli Albizi, but better proportioned. Our intention was to take the young  girls by force, and to bring them to Castille as a wonderful thing. While  we were forming this design there entered by the door of the hut as many  as thirty-six men, much bigger than the women, and so well made that  it was a rare thing to behold them. They, in like manner, put us into  such a state of perturbation that we rather wished we were on board,  than having dealings with such people. They carried very large bows and  arrows, and great clubs with knobs. They talked among themselves in a  tone as if they wished to destroy us. Seeing ourselves in such danger,  we made various suggestions one to another. Some proposed that we should  attack them in the hut, and others said that it would be better to do so  outside, while others advised that we should not take any action until  we saw what the natives were going to do. We at last agreed to go out of  the hut, and walk away in the direction of the ships as if nothing had  happened, and this we did. Having taken our route to return to the ships,  they also came along behind us at a distance of about a stone's-throw,  talking among themselves. I believe they had not less fear of us than we  of them; for sometimes we stopped to rest, and they did so also without  coming nearer. At last we came to the beach, where the boats where  waiting for us. We got in, and, when we were some way from the shore,  the natives rushed down and shot many arrows; but we then had little  fear of them. We replied with two bombard-shots, more to frighten them  than to do them harm. They all fled into the woods, and so we took leave  of them, thankful to escape after a dangerous adventure. They all went  naked like the others. We called this island _the Island of the Giants_,  by reason of their stature.[94]    We proceeded onwards along the coast, and there happened to be combats  with the natives many times, because they did not wish us to take  anything from the land. At length we became desirous of returning to  Castille, having been on the sea for nearly a year[95] and the provisions  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#11)"],[1,"in the world. The lure of  the thing is unexplainable.    During those dizzy hours on deck I thought of those who had preceded me;  of heroic men who for three centuries had braved suffering, cold and  famine, who had sacrificed the comforts of civilization, their families  and friends, who had given their own lives in the pursuit of this  mysterious, yea, fruitless quest. I remembered reading the thrilling  tales of those who returned--tales which had flushed me with excitement  and inspired me with the same mad ambition. I thought of the noble,  indefatigable efforts of these men, of the heart-sickening failures, in  which I too had shared. And I felt the indomitable, swift surge of their  awful, goading determination within me--to subdue the forces of nature,  to cover as Icarus did the air those icy spaces, to reach the  silver-shining vacantness which men called the North Pole.    As we cut the shimmering waters, I felt, as it were, the wierd, unseen  presence of those who had died there--died horribly--men whose bodies  had withered, with slow suffering, in frigid blasts and famine, who  possibly had prolonged their suffering by feeding upon their own doomed  companions--and of others who had perished swiftly in the sudden yawning  of the leprous white mouth of the hungry frozen sea. It is said by some  that souls live only after death by the energy of great emotions, great  loves, or great ambitions generated throughout life. It seemed to me, in  those hours of intoxication, that I could feel the implacable,  unsatisfied desire of these disembodied things, who had vibrated with  one aim and still yearned in the spirit for what now they were  physically unable to attain. It seemed that my brain was fired with the  intensity of all these dead men's ambition, that my heart in sympathy  beat more turbulently with the throb of their dead hearts; I felt  growing within me, irresistibly, what I did not dare, for fear it might  not be possible, to confide to Bradley--a determination, even in the  face of peril, to essay the Pole!    From this time onward, and until I turned my back upon the fruitless  silver-shining place of desolation at the apex of the world, I felt the  intoxication, the intangible lure of the thing exhilarating, buoying me  gladsomely, beating in my heart with a singing rhythm. I recall it now  with marveling, and am filled with the pathos of it. Yet, despite all  that I have suffered since because of it, I regret not those enraptured  hours of perpetual glitter of midnight suns.    One morning we reached the northern shore of Melville Bay, and the bold  cliffs of Cape York were dimly outlined through a gray mist. Strong  southern winds had carried such great masses of ice against the coast  that it was impossible to make a near approach, and as a strong wind  continued, there was such a heavy sea along the bobbing line of outer  ice as to make it quite impossible to land and thence proceed toward the  shore.    We were desirous of meeting the natives of Cape York, but these ice  conditions forced us to proceed without touching here, and so we set our  course for the next of the northernmost villages, at North Star Bay. By  noon the mist had vanished, and we saw clearly the steep slopes and warm  color of crimson cliffs rising precipitously out of the water. The coast  line is about two thousand feet high, evidently the remains of an old  tableland which extends a considerable distance northward. Here and  there were short glaciers which had worn the cliffs away in their  ceaseless effort to reach the sea. The air was full of countless gulls,  guillemots, little auks and eider-ducks.    As the eye followed the long and lofty line of crimson cliffs, there  came into sight a towering, conical rock, a well-known guidepost for the  navigator. Continuing, we caught sight of the long ice wall of Petowik  Glacier, and behind this, extending far to the eastward, the  scintillating, white expanse of the overland-ice which blankets the  interior of all Greenland.    The small and widely scattered villages of the Eskimos of this region  are hemmed in by the ice walls of Melville Bay on the southward, the  stupendous cliffs of Humboldt Glacier on the north, an arm of the sea to  the westward, and the hopelessly desolate Greenland interior toward the  east.    There is really no reason why many Eskimos should not live here, for  there is abundant food in both sea and air, and even considerable game  on land. Blue and white foxes are everywhere to be seen. There is the  seal, the walrus, the narwhal, and the white whale. There is the white  bear, monarch of the Polar wilds, who roams in every direction over his  kingdom. The principal reason why the population remains so small lies  in the hazardous conditions of life. Children are highly prized, and a  marriageable woman or girl who has one or more of them is much more  valuable as a match than one who is childless.    The coast line here is paradoxically curious, for although the coast  exceeds but barely more than two hundred miles of latitude it presents  in reality a sea line of about four thousand miles when the great  indentations of Wolstenholm Sound, Inglefield Gulf, and other bays,  sounds and fiords are measured.    We sailed cautiously now about Cape Atholl, which we were to circle; a  fog lay upon the waters, almost entirely hiding the innumerable  icebergs, and making it difficult to pick our course among the dangerous  rocks in this vicinity.    Rounding Cape Atholl, we sailed into Wolstenholm Sound and turned our  prow toward the Eskimo village on North Star Bay.    North Star Bay is guarded by a promontory expressively named Table  Mountain, \"Oomanaq.\" As we neared this headland, many natives came out  in kayaks to meet us. Inasmuch as I knew most of them personally, I felt  a singular thrill of pleasure in seeing them. Years before, I learned  their simple-hearted faithfulness. Knud Rasmussen, a Danish writer,  living as a native among the Eskimos, apparently for the sake of getting  local color, was in one of the canoes and came aboard the ship.    As it was necessary to make slight repairs to the schooner, we here had  to follow the primitive method of docking by preliminary beaching her.  This was done at high tide when the propeller, which had been bent--the  principal damage to the ship--was straightened. At the same time we gave  the yacht a general looking-over, and righted a universal joint whose  loosening had disabled the engine.    Meanwhile the launch kept busy scurrying to and fro, our quest being  occasionally rewarded with eider-ducks or other game. Late at night, a  visit was made to the village of Oomanooi. It could hardly be called a  village, for it consisted merely of seven triangular sealskin tents,  conveniently placed on picturesque rocks. Gathered about these in large  numbers, were men, women and children, shivering in the midnight chill.    These were odd-looking specimens of humanity. In height, the men  averaged but five feet, two inches, and the women four feet, ten. All  had broad, fat faces, heavy bodies and well-rounded limbs. Their skin  was slightly bronzed; both men and women had coal-black hair and brown  eyes. Their noses were short, and their hands and feet short, but thick.    A genial woman was found at every tent opening, ready to receive  visitors in due form. We entered and had a short chat with each family.  Subjects of conversation were necessarily limited, but after all, they  were about the same as they would have been in a civilized region. We  conversed as to whether or not all of us had been well, of deaths,  marriages and births. Then we talked of the luck of the chase, which  meant prosperity or need of food. Even had it been a civilized  community, there would have been little questioning regarding national  or international affairs, because, in such case, everyone reads the  papers. Here there was no comment on such subjects simply because nobody  cares anything about them or has any papers to read.    That a prominent Eskimo named My-ah had disposed of a few surplus wives  to gain the means whereby to acquire a few more dogs, was probably the  most important single item of information conveyed. I was also informed  that at the present time there happened to be only one other man with  two wives.    Marriage, among these folk, is a rather free and easy institution. It  is, indeed, not much more than a temporary tie of possession. Men  exchange partners with each other much in the manner that men in other  countries swap horses. And yet, the position of women is not so humble  as this custom might seem to indicate, for they themselves are  permitted, not infrequently, to choose new partners. These exceedingly  primitive ideas work out surprisingly well in practice in these isolated  regions, for such exchanges, when made, are seemingly to the advantage  and satisfaction of all parties; no regrets are expressed, and the feuds  of divorce courts, of alimony proceedings, of damages for alienation of  affection, which prevail in so-called civilization, are unknown.    It is certainly a curious thing that these simple but intelligent people  are able to control their own destinies with a comfortable degree of  success, although they are without laws or literature and without any  fixed custom to regulate the matrimonial bond.    It would seem as if there ought to be a large population, for there is  an average of about three fat, clever children for each family, the  youngest as a rule picturesquely resting in a pocket on the mother's  back. But the hardships of life in this region are such that accidents  and deaths keep down the population.    Each tent has a raised platform, upon which all sleep. The edge of this  makes a seat, and on each side are placed stone lamps in which blubber  is burned, with moss as a wick. Over this is a drying rack, also a few  sticks, but there is no"]]]
