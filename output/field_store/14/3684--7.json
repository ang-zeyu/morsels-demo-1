[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33721"],[0,"The Barren Ground Caribou of Keewatin (#11)"],[1,"y,  I found a certain grass (_Agrostis scabra_) growing. I did not recognize  or collect it elsewhere during the season. Is this perhaps like certain  other species, such as _Juncus tenuis_ (_fide_ Dr. Edgar T. Wherry) and  _Eleocharis baldwinii_, in curiously thriving on beaten paths?    When the Caribou arrive at some lake or river, they generally follow the  shores for a greater or lesser distance, seeking either a way around or  a suitable crossing-place. The trails thus formed are generally on the  nearest ridges rather than on the immediate shores. Their direction, as  they conform to the winding shores, may diverge very widely from the  desired migratory course.    In many parts of the Barren Grounds there must be as many as 10 linear  miles of caribou trails to every square mile of territory. Even if there  were only one mile of such trails to each square mile, the total, on the  Barrens of Keewatin and Mackenzie alone, would equal or exceed all the  railway mileage in the United States.    In contrast to the narrow ridges, the broader hilltops in the Barrens  offer such freedom of movement to the Caribou that trails are much less  likely to be formed in such places, even when they are frequented by  large numbers of the animals. Thus I found the broad summit of Josie's  Hill practically without well-defined trails, despite the regularity  with which many migrant bands resort thither. In feeding or traveling  over such an area, there is no occasion for restricting themselves to a  narrow course. In crossing from one ridge to another through an  intervening bog, the animals may leave numerous scattered and temporary  trails in the dense sedge growth to mark their passage (fig. 13). On the  uniform surface of such a bog, as on the broad hilltops, there is no  need to confine their steps to any particular course.    It might be supposed that the Barren Ground Caribou would have some  reluctance in entering thickly wooded tracts, where Wolves naturally  have a much better chance of a close approach than on the open Barrens.  As already stated, however, their trails may be found more or less  throughout the spruce and tamarack growth in the Windy River area. One  of these tracts, covering probably several square miles on the west side  of Four-hill Creek, is fairly crisscrossed with trails. At deep dusk on  October 2, while several of us were skinning a Black Bear in this thick  timber, about five does and fawns trotted up quite close to us. Perhaps  they were on their way to the open Barrens to pass the night. While  wintering in the forested Hudsonian Zone, the animals may spend their  nights as well as their diurnal resting periods on the frozen lakes and  rivers.    Fred Schweder, Jr., says that Caribou are somewhat fearful of sand hills  or eskers, and that he has never seen one lying down in such a place; he  believes this is because the Wolves frequent the eskers in summertime.  On the other hand, Mr. G. W. Malaher spoke of a long esker that extends  down the west side of Nueltin Lake and far to the southward; this, he  said, forms a migration highway for the Caribou.      _References on habitats and trails._--J. B.

The temperature has an important effect on the activity of the insect  pests (see _Influence of insects on distribution_) and thus, to a  certain extent during summer and fall, on the behavior and probably the  distribution of the Caribou.    Low winter temperatures on the Barren Grounds do not appear to be a  factor of prime importance in the seasonal distribution of _R. a.  arcticus_. \"Some individuals and small herds remain in the northern part  of the range at all seasons\" (R. M. Anderson, 1947: 178). Peary's  Caribou (_R. pearyi_) inhabits the more northerly Arctic islands  throughout the year, without engaging in such extensive migrations as  its relative to the south.    The forceful winds that blow over the Barren Grounds so much of the time  are of distinct benefit to the Caribou during the summer in abating the  very serious scourge of flies. If other things were equal (as they are  not), this factor alone would make the Barrens a more favorable summer  habitat than the forested country. (See _Retrograde autumnal movement_.)  Air movements of similar strength during the winter must, through the  wind-chill factor (_cf._ Siple and Passel, 1945), make life so much the  harder for any living being; on the other hand, they tend to sweep the  ridges bare of snow, thereby making readily available the Caribou's  principal winter food of reindeer lichens (_Cladonia_ spp.)      _References._--Armstrong, 1857: 479; Critchell-Bullock, 1930:    192, 194-196; Hoare, 1930: 33; Jacobi, 1931: 193, 195; Clarke,    1940: 96, 99; Banfield, 1951a: 27-29.      _Influence of food supply on distribution_    The strong winter winds on the Barrens affect the Caribou in still  another way. While they pack the snow so firmly that man may dispense  with snowshoes, this condition naturally increases the difficulty that  the Caribou experience in pawing through the snow to reach the lichens  that are covered by it. The limited grazing capacity of such areas as  are laid bare by the wind may force a reduction in the wintering  population. Although the snow in the timbered regions to the south  covers virtually the whole surface of the land, it is evidently less  compact and so offers more favorable feeding conditions than the areas  of hard-packed snow on the Barrens. (Charles Schweder states that Willow  Ptarmigan will fly out of the Barrens to spend the night in tracts of  timber, where the snow is softer and thus more suitable for the  nocturnal burrows of these birds.)    Another apparent inducement for resorting to the tracts of timber in  winter is the abundance there of tree lichens, such as _Alectoria_ and  _Usnea_ (_cf._ Richardson, 1829: 243; J. B. Tyrrell, 1894: 441; Dix,  1951: 287), upon which the Caribou may feed without regard to snow  conditions. (See also _Retrograde autumnal movement_.)    Reindeer lichens (_Cladonia_ spp.) and doubtless other lichens are of  such slow growth that forest fires may deprive the Caribou of this  indispensable food for a period of years. According to Mr. G. W.  Malaher, the recent burning of a large area north of The Pas may have  deflected the animals toward the southeast, causing them to extend their  migration to an abnormal distance in that direction. For a similar  reason in years past, according to Pike (1917 [1892]: 50), they avoided  \"great stretches of the country\" near the Mackenzie River, and also on  the south side of Great Slave Lake. A quarter of a century after Pike's  time, Dogribs reported that Caribou had not come to the lower Taltson  River for several years, \"because the timber had been burned off\"  (Harper, 1932: 30). Some years ago, extensive fires in Manitoba were  said to have been deliberately set by prospectors with the aim of  exposing the underlying rock.    Charles Schweder believes that the Caribou show a certain predilection  for rocky places, owing to the more luxuriant growth of lichens there.      _References._--Richardson, \"1825\": 328-329; Bompas, 1888: 24;    Pike, 1917 (1892): 50; Wheeler, 1914: 60; Blanchet, 1930: 52;    Jacobi, 1931: 192, 194, 195; Harper, 1932: 30; Ingstad, 1933:    34, 161, 163; Hornby, 1934: 105; R. M.

Anderson, 1948: 15; Banfield, 1951a: 5, 11, 27-29.      _Influence of insects on distribution_    It is quite possible that the blood-sucking mosquitoes (_Aedes_) and  black flies (_Simulium_) and the parasitic warble flies (_Oedemagena_)  and nostril flies (_Cephenemyia_) have a definite and important  influence on the extent and dates of caribou migration.    As far as I am able to judge from my own experience, mosquitoes are more  or less equally numerous and ferocious in the Canadian, the Hudsonian,  and the Arctic Zones of the Northwest. Naturally the season begins  earlier in the more southerly localities. In two seasons (1914, 1920) at  the western end of Lake Athabaska they began to be troublesome about the  middle of June, whereas at Nueltin Lake this stage was reached about the  first of July. In the Athabaska and Great Slave lakes region (Canadian  and Hudsonian Zones) I have never had occasion to regard black flies as  serious in respect to either numbers or ferocity; but there is universal  agreement that conditions are vastly different and worse on the Barren  Grounds. At Nueltin Lake the _Simulium_ hordes become troublesome at  approximately the same time as the mosquitoes. Toward the end of August  there is a merciful diminution in the numbers of both mosquitoes and  black flies on the Barrens, and after the first of September they may be  practically disregarded, except on an occasional day of unseasonable  warmth.    It may be remarked in passing that one of the insect terrors of the  Athabaska region, the so-called \"bulldog\" (a species of Tabanidae), did  not come to my attention as a pest at Nueltin Lake though I collected  two species of _Tabanus_. Malloch (1919), in reporting on the Diptera of  the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-18, does not include a single  species of Tabanidae. On the other hand, Twinn (1950: 18) states that 17  species have been found at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#11)"],[1,"is  sometimes a serious question. If labelled and put into the storeroom  they take up valuable space; also much time is spent taking them out at  canteen hour and in putting them away. If a child is allowed to keep  food of any kind in her tent, it is quite impossible to have the  blankets, cots, or pillows in absolutely perfect condition.    All things considered, it seems best not to allow food including fruit  or candy to be sent or brought into camp.      EQUIPMENT FOR SWIMMING AND BOATING    The average child who enters camp does not know how to swim and knows  less about boating. What is more, it is probably the only place for many  to learn to do these things. Taking a dip for the sake of having a good  time, splashing in the water, and so forth, is one thing, but to really  learn to swim, to dive, to throw a life line, to rescue, to resuscitate,  is quite a different matter. These things must be learned, for as a  matter of fact, human beings do none of them naturally.    When possible a crib for beginners is a very desirable thing to have.  (p. 69.) Unless there is a safe beach or shallow water and a good bottom  there is more or less danger attending the teaching of swimming to a  group of children even though the group be small. With the crib, for use  especially in deep lakes and ponds, this danger is practically overcome,  and in consequence much anxiety on the part of those in charge of the  camp eliminated. The child seems to fear less, therefore learns to swim  sooner. A crib 20 x 85 feet is large enough for a group of twenty  children (Cut H.) It is built partially on land by the water's edge, is  made of logs and planks and pulled into the water over logs used as  rollers. A floor is made of 6 inch planks placed half an inch apart and  nailed on to a rectangular frame work of logs with lengthwise supports  under the planks. Uprights of logs are placed at intervals along the  sides and ends and at the corners. Two and a half feet from either end a  second row of uprights is placed. The sides and inner ends are built up  to a height of 5 feet, the outer ends to 3 feet. The crib is pulled into  the water and towed to its position by a pier or wharf. It is sunk with  stones between the double ends until the floor is 3-1/2 feet below the  surface of the water at the pier end, and 4 feet below the surface at  the other end. It is held in position by being fastened to piles placed  at intervals around the edge. Steps lead down into the crib either from  the end of a pier, or from a wharf. As soon as a child can swim three  times around the crib without touching her foot to the bottom of the  crib or her hands to the sides, and can demonstrate three strokes, she  should be allowed to go into deep water, but should be carefully watched  for a while.    [Illustration: \"EATS\"]    Land drill preceding the swimming lesson is very helpful. An expert  person should be made responsible for not more than twenty girls at one  time unless the girls are competent swimmers, and no one should be  allowed to interfere with the rules and regulations laid down by the  person in charge. Absolute obedience to all signals, rules and  regulations must be observed. An assistant counsellor should always be  in attendance at swimming lessons.    [Illustration: H. Swimming Crib as it would appear out of water. The  crib is 35' by 20', outside dimensions, with end pockets for stones,  2-1/2' each, leaving a swimming space of 30' by 20'. The idea for this  was planned and executed by the Engineers of the Park Commission of the  N.Y. and N.J. Interstate Park, for use in the camps in the Palisades  Park.]    Deep water swimmers should be able to pass the following requirements:  demonstrate three different strokes, breast, overarm and back stroke.  Swim under water. Demonstrate resuscitation. Throw a life-line  twenty-five feet for accuracy. Demonstrate diving, shallow, deep and  fancy diving. Rescue a drowning person twenty-five feet away from a  raft. Swim 50 yards with clothes on.    It is always advisable during a swimming period to have a boat well  manned near at hand. Bathing in fresh water, especially in spring-fed  lakes is not as exhilarating as salt water bathing, and twenty minutes  is considered the longest time a girl should stay in fresh water. Great  care should be taken that no child is allowed to get chilled. At the  first sign of pinchedness, shivering, or blue lips the child should be  called out of the water, and instructed to rub herself briskly and dress  at once.    [Illustration: THE MORNING AFTER]    Bathers should always be counted immediately before going into the  water, and immediately after being called out. It is well to have  assembly and roll call for this.      Suits    A word as to bathing suits may not be amiss. Care should be taken that  the shoulder straps are tight enough and the under arm seam sewed up  high enough to keep the top part of the suit in place. It is recommended  that camps adopt a uniform style of bathing suit and that all classified  groups wear bathing caps of the same color, as for instance, first  class swimmers wear white caps, second class blue caps, third class  green caps, and fourth class, red caps.      The Float    Probably there is more fun experienced by the Scouts who are privileged  to use a raft or float, than by all the other campers put together. To  get out of the crib group and go for the first time to the float is a  thrilling experience and one that is much discussed and enjoyed. Water  sports without a float cannot be imagined, neither can a camp really be  called a Girl Scout camp unless it possesses this important piece of  floating property, which may be large or small, but must be properly  built to be safe. For a camp of 150 or more, a float 20 x 40 feet is  none too large. It should be equipped with spring board, diving tower  and life lines, and moored in deep water, not too long a swim from  shore.    Bath houses are not always considered necessary to campers but the use  of them does much toward keeping tents and tent equipment in good  condition. Wet floors, cots, blankets and so forth are always a  detriment and should not be allowed. If bath houses are impossible,  erect a large tent with a clothes line running from pole to pole and low  benches under it to serve as racks for clothing. Have pails at hand for  holding rinsing water. This kind of bath house is easily arranged.    Where possible it is an excellent idea for girls to be able to take a  quick dip before dressing for breakfast, but in a large camp this is not  always possible, and other arrangements have to be made for the morning  ablutions, as have been suggested in another part of this book.      Boats    Only first class swimmers should be allowed the use when alone, of boats  of any kind. The flat bottomed boats are the safest and it is almost  impossible to tip them over. They are, however, much heavier and harder  to manage than the round bottomed boats. Care should be taken that not  too many girls go in one boat at one time and that whoever is put in  charge of the group must be obeyed. Girls should be taught to row, how  to enter a boat and leave it, how to tie it, how to seat passengers so  that the boat will be well balanced, how to row alone, and how to keep  stroke with another.      Camp Supplies    A list of firms handling approved equipment for camps will be furnished  upon request to National Headquarters Girl Scouts, Inc.    [Illustration: SETTING OUT FOR THE WATER HIKE]          WATER FRONT PROTECTION FOR SUMMER CAMPS              _By_              Captain Fred. C. Mills,            Red Cross Life Saving Corps,            Atlantic Division.      Every camp that is situated on water or has a near-by bathing place,  should organize its water front protection system before the camp opens.      Choice of Bathing Place    The swimming place should be so chosen as to combine, if possible, deep  water swimming for the experienced swimmers and a shallow bathing place  for beginners. The non-swimmers' pool should never be over four and  one-half feet deep at its deepest point.      Equipment    _For Beginners._ The non-swimmers' pool should be enclosed on three  sides by life lines, (1\" to 1-1/2\" manila rope, depending on weather  conditions), buoyed up every fifteen feet by cork floats or balsa wood  buoys, painted white and made fast at the corners to piles driven into  the sand, or to buoys moored with rocks or cement moorings. No beginners  should be allowed to go beyond these lines.    _For Swimmers._ The area to be used by Swimmers should then be plainly  marked off with white floats moored to the bottom, with a flag placed at  top. No swimmer, no matter how expert, should be allowed to go beyond  these floats, unless permission is obtained from the Master of Aquatics.    Great care should be taken that all diving platforms and spring boards  are safely situated and that the water surrounding these diving  arrangements is clear of all rocks, stumpage, etc., to the depth of at  least 10 feet. Ladders should be placed at the float to allow swimmers  to climb from the water easily.    [Illustration: LAYING THE FIRE]    _Tower._ A small tower, eight to twelve feet high, should be erected on  the shore so as to overlook the bathing place. A warning signal, such as  a bell or gong, should be placed in the tower.    _Life Boats._ Two or more boats, depending on the size of the camp,  should be set aside for life-saving patrol. These should be equipped  with life lines looped around the outside of the gunwhale, ring  rowlocks, and an air tank placed under the bow and stern seats. A hole  should be cut in the top of the stern board for sculling.    Life boats should be chosen that are light and easy to handle, and care  should be used in picking boats that are sea-worthy and have good beam.    One life boat should always be at the dock, ready for instant use, while  "]]]
