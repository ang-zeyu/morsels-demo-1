Those histories, indeed, are  frequently found ornamented with ancient bassi relievi, with sarcophagi,  and with inscriptions copied, for the most part, from Paduan marbles; a  practice followed, also, by Mantegna, but with more moderation, in the  chapel of the Eremitani.    The rest of his contemporaries, in Padua, were Lorenzo da Lendinara,  esteemed an excellent artist, but of whom no traces remain; Marco Zoppo,  of Bologna, who more nearly resembled, perhaps, his master than his  fellow pupil, but of honourable account, as the head of the Bolognese  School; and Dario da Trevigi, whose productions are to be seen in S.  Bernardino, at Bassano, opposite to those of Mantegna, as if to exhibit  their inferiority. Girolamo, or rather Gregorio[35] Schiavone, whose  style is between that of Mantegna and the Bellini, is a pleasing artist,  whose pictures are frequently to be met with, ornamented with  architectural views, with fruits, and above all with joyous little  cherubs. One of the most delightful I have seen, was in Fossombrone, in  possession of a private individual, and it bears inscribed, _Opus  Sclavonii Dalmatici Squarzoni S. (Scholaris)_. Hieronymus Tarvisio is  another, but doubtful pupil of Squarcione, whose name I found subscribed  in some pictures at Trevigi, an artist poor in colours, but not  unacquainted with design. We find mention in Sansovino, an author not  always to be relied upon in his account of Venetian paintings, of Lauro  Padovano, who produced several histories of S. Giovanni for the Carita  in Venice; but I so far agree with the above author, in pronouncing  these altogether in the style of Mantegna. Nearly approaching also to  the composition of this school, is the style of Maestro Angelo, who  painted in the ancient refectory of Santa Giustina, a Crucifixion of the  Saviour, with figures, both in proportions and in spirit truly great. I  have nothing to add to the name of Mattio dal Pozzo, enumerated in this  class by Scardeone, (p. 371) inasmuch as there are none of his works now  surviving.    At the period, when the School of Padua was opposed to the Venetian, the  other cities of the state, as far as we can learn, had adopted a taste  rather for the ornamental style of the latter, than the more erudite  maxims of the former; it might, perhaps, be added, on account of its  greater facility; because the beauty of nature is everywhere more  obvious than the monuments of antiquity. Bassano then boasted a  Francesco da Ponte, Vicenza the two Montagna and Bonconsigli, all of  whom, though born in the immediate vicinity of Padua, became disciples  of the Bellini. Da Ponte, a native of Vicenza, was pretty well embued  with a taste for polite literature and philosophy, extremely desirable  in the head of a school, such as he became in the instruction of Jacopo,  and through him of the Bassanese; a school highly distinguished during,  and even beyond the sixteenth century. The style of his altarpieces,  when compared with each other, acquaints us with the earliest and latest  specimens of his pencil. He is diligent, but dry in that of his S.  Bartolommeo, in the cathedral at Bassano; more soft in another at the  church of S. Giovanni, but far better in one of the Pentecost, which he  painted for the village of Oliero, almost in the style of the moderns,  displaying studied composition, and a colouring various, beautiful, and  harmonious; and what is still more, a fine expression of the passions,  best adapted to the mystery. We are led to believe, from the account of  Lomazzo, that he likewise painted, at another period, in Lombardy;  observing that a certain Francesco, of Vicenza, produced a work at the  _Grazie_ of Milan, well executed in point of design, but not so pleasing  in the effect of its lights and shades.    The two Montagna flourished about the period 1500, in Vicenza, and were  employed together, however unequal in genius, being equally followers of  the Bellini, at least if we are to give credit to Ridolfi, who must have  seen many of their productions, now no longer in existence. In those  which I have seen, there appeared strong traces of the style of  Mantegna. Benedetto is not mentioned by Vasari, who is apt to omit the  names of all artists whom he accounted of inferior worth. He mentions  Bartolommeo, as a pupil of Mantegna,[36] and he would certainly have  done him more justice had he seen the works he produced in his native  place, which, so far from having done, he asserts that the artist  constantly resided in Venice. Vicenza boasts many of his pieces, which  display the gradual progress of his style. If we wish to estimate the  extent of his powers, we ought to consult his altarpiece at S. Michele,  and another at S. Rocco, to which may be added a third, in that of the  Seminary at Padua. In none of these are we able to discover any  composition beyond what was in most general use at that period, already  so frequently mentioned by us; and they retain more of the practice of  gilding, which, in other places, was then becoming obsolete. In fine,  this artist will be found to rank equal with the chief part of his  contemporaries; exact in design, skilful in the naked parts, while his  colours are fresh and warm. His cherubs are peculiarly graceful and  pleasing, and in his altarpiece, at S. Michele, he has introduced an  architecture which recedes from, and deceives the eye with a power of  illusion, sufficient of itself to have rendered him conspicuous. Of  Giovanni Speranza, there remain a few pieces which are much esteemed,  though not remarkable for strength of colouring. But we can meet with no  public specimens of Veruzio, and most probably his name is a mere  equivoque of Vasari.[37] Giovanni Bonconsigli, called Marescalco, or the  steward, was esteemed beyond any other of the artists of Vicenza, who  flourished at this period, and he certainly approaches nearest to the  modern style, and that of the Bellini. The practice, however, of  ornamenting friezes with tritons and similar figures, taken from the  antique, he most likely derived from the adjacent cities of Padua or  Verona, one of which then professed the study of antiquity, the other  that of monuments. Neither Vasari nor Ridolfi gives any account of his  productions, except such as he painted in Venice, at this time either  wholly perished or defaced. Those which he executed in Vicenza are still  in good condition, nor ought a stranger of good taste to leave the place  without visiting the chapel de' Turchini, to admire his Madonna in the  style of Raffaello, seated upon a throne, between four saints, among  which the figure of S. Sebastian is a masterpiece of ideal beauty.  Indeed an able professor of the city considered it one of the finest  specimens of the art the place could boast, though in possession of many  of the first merit. In common with Montagna, Figolino, and Speranza,  Bonconsigli abounds in perspective views, and discovers a natural genius  for architecture; like them he appears to give promise of the approach  of a divine Palladio, the glory of his country and of his art; along  with the Scamozzi, and many other citizens, who have rendered Vicenza at  once the boast and wonder, as well as the school of architects. There  are two altarpieces of his hand remaining in Montagnana. This artist  must not be confounded with Pietro Marescalco, surnamed lo Spada, (the  sword,) whom the MS. history of Feltre mentions as a native of this  city, and complains of Vasari's silence upon it. One of his altarpieces  is to be seen at the Nunnery of the Angeli, at Feltre, where Signor Cav.  de Lazara informs me that he read the name of _Petrus Marescalcus P_.  Among other figures is a Madonna, between two angels, upon a large  scale, and in good design, sufficient to entitle Pietro to an honourable  rank in the history of art. If we compare him with Giovanni, he will be  found less vivid in point of colouring, and, apparently, of a somewhat  later age.    In the order of our narrative, we ought now to pass on to Verona, where  Liberale, a disciple of Vincenzio di Stefano, at that time held sway. He  had also been a scholar or rather imitator of Jacopo Bellini, to whose  style, says Vasari, he invariably adhered. Moreover, in his picture of  the Epiphany, to be seen in the cathedral, there is a choir of angels  with a graceful folding of drapery, and a taste so peculiarly that of  Mantegna, that I was easily led to believe him an artist belonging to  that class. Certain it is that the vicinity of Mantua might also have  facilitated his imitation of Mantegna, traces of which are visible in  some other of his works, as well as in those of the more and less known  Veronese artists of the time. He did not attain the excellence of  Giovanni Bellini, nor did he give the same grandeur to his proportions,  and the same enlargement of the ancient style, although he continued to  flourish until the year 1535. The colour of his tints is strong; his  expression studied and graceful; a very general merit in the painters of  Verona; and his care is exquisite, especially in his diminutive figures,  an art in which he became extremely expert, owing to his habit of  illustrating books in miniature, which are still to be seen in Verona  and in Siena.    He had a competitor, at his native place, in Domenico Morone, or rather  the latter, educated also by a disciple of Stefano, is to be held second  to him. This artist was succeeded in the course of time, by his son,  Francesco Morone, superior to his father, and by Girolamo da' Libri.  These two, bound by the strictest habits of friendship from their youth,  were frequently employed in the same labours together, and may be said  to have adopted the same maxims. The first has been commended by Vasari,  for the grace, the design, the harmony, and the warm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#11)"],[1,"in conjunction with the brevis of Life,  makes it at least reasonable that when a man has faithfully served  one exclusive apprenticeship, he will find it too late in the day  to serve a second.  Moreover, there are few advantages in training  which do not, according to present social arrangements,  involve corresponding penalties.    Human ignorance is, after all, more variable in character than in extent.  Each sphere of life, each occupation, is burdened with its own special brand  of this unhappy heritage.  To remove one small section of inborn ignorance  is a life-work for any man.  'Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance,'  was what betrayed the great lexicographer into defining 'pastern'  as 'a horse's knee.' And the Doctor was right (in his admission,  of course, not in his definition).  Ignorance, reader, pure ignorance  is what debars you from conversing fluently and intelligibly  in several dialects of the Chinese language.  Yet a friend of mine,  named Yabby Pelham, can do so, though the same person knows  as little of book-lore as William Shakespear of Stratford knew.  But if you had been brought up in a Chinese camp, on a worn-out gold-field,  your own special acquirements, and corresponding ignorance,  might run in grooves similar to Yabby's.  Let each of us keep himself  behind the spikes on this question of restricted capability.    And should some blue-blooded insect indignantly retort that,  though his own ancestors have borne coat-armour for seventeen generations,  and though he himself was brought up so utterly and aristocratically useless  as to have been unable, at twenty years of age, to polish his own boots,  yet he is now, mentally and physically, a man fit for anything--  I can only reply, in the words of Portia, that I fear me my lady his mother  played false with a smith.  But this, again, would be claiming  too much for heredity, at the expense of training.  Remember, however,  that our present subject is not the 'gentleman' of actual life.  He is an unknown and elusive quantity, merging insensibly into saint  or scoundrel, sage or fool, man or blackleg.  He runs in all shapes,  and in all degrees of definiteness.  Our subject is that insult  to common sense, that childish slap in the face of honest manhood,  the 'gentleman' of fiction, and of Australian fiction pre-eminently.    Heaven knows I am no more inclined to decry social culture  than moral principle; but I acknowledge no aristocracy except one of service  and self-sacrifice, in which he that is chief shall be servant,  and he that is greatest of all, servant of all.  And it is surely time  to notice the threepenny braggadocio of caste which makes  the languid Captain Vemon de Vere (or words to that effect)  an overmatch for half-a-dozen hard-muscled white savages,  any one of whom would take his lordship by the ankles, and wipe the battlefield  with his patrician visage; which makes the pale, elegant aristocrat  punch Beelzebub out of Big Mick, the hod-man, who, in unpleasant reality,  would feel the kick of a horse less than his antagonist would  the wind of heaven, visiting his face too roughly; which makes  the rosy-cheeked darling of the English rectory show the saddle-hardened  specialists of the back country how to ride a buckjumper; which makes a party  of resourceful bushmen stand helpless in the presence of flood or fire,  till marshalled by some hero of the croquet lawn; above all,  which makes the isocratic and irreverent Australian fawn on the 'gentleman,'  for no imaginable reason except that the latter says 'deuced'  instead of 'sanguinary,' and 'by Jove' instead of 'by sheol.'  Go to; I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad.    And don't fall back upon the musty subterfuge which, by a shifting value  of the term, represents 'gentleman' as simply signifying a man of honour,  probity, education, and taste; for, by immemorial usage,  by current application, and by every rule which gives definite meaning  to words, the man with a shovel in his hand, a rule in his pocket,  an axe on his shoulder, a leather apron on his abdomen, or any other badge  of manual labour about him--his virtues else be they as pure as grace,  as infinite as man may undergo--is carefully contradistinguished  from the 'gentleman.' The 'gentleman' may be a drunkard, a gambler,  a debauchee, a parasite, a helpless potterer; he may be a man of spotless life,  able and honest; but he must on no account be a man with broad palms,  a workman amongst workmen.  The 'gentleman' is not necessarily gentle;  but he is necessarily genteel.  Etymology is not at fault here;  gentility, and gentility alone, is the qualification of the 'gentleman.'    No doubt it is very nice to see a 'gentleman' who, when drunk,  can lie in the gutter like a 'gentleman'; but will someone suggest  a more pitiable sight than such a person trying to compete with  an iron-sinewed miner on the goldfields, or with a hardy, nine-lifed bushman  in the back country?  In the back country, a penniless and  friendless 'gentleman,' if sober and honest and possessed of some  little ability, may aspire to the position of a station storekeeper.  If destitute of these advantages--and reduced 'gentlemen' are not by any means  always sober, honest, and capable--the best thing he can do,  if he gets the chance, is to settle down thankfully into the innocent  occupation so earnestly desired by Henry the Sixth of the play,  and so thriftily pursued by the alleged father of any amateur elocutionist  whose name is Norval on the Grampian Hills.    Of such reduced 'gentlemen' it is often said that their education  becomes their curse.  Here is another little subterfuge.  This is one of those taking expressions which are repeated from parrot  to magpie till they seem to acquire axiomatic force.  It is  such men's ignorance--their technical ignorance--that is their curse.  Education of any kind never was, and never can be, a curse to its possessor;  it is a curse only to the person whose interest lies in exploiting  its possessor.  Erudition, even in the humblest sphere of life,  is the sweetest solace, the unfailing refuge, of the restless mind;  but if the bearer thereof be not able to do something well enough  to make a living by it, his education is simply outclassed, overborne,  and crushed by his own superior ignorance.    To be sure, there are men of social culture who gallantly and conspicuously  maintain an all-round superiority in the society to which I myself  hereditarily belong, namely, the Lower Orders; but their appearances  are like angels' visits--in the obvious, as well as in the conventional  but remoter sense.  I can count no less than three men of this stamp  among my ten thousand acquaintances.  When the twofold excellence  of such ambidexters is not stultified by selfishness, you have in them  a realised ideal upon which their Creator might pronounce the judgment  that it is very good.  Move heaven and earth, then, to multiply that ideal  by the number of the population.  The thing is, at least,  theoretically possible; for it is in no way necessary that the manual worker  should be rude and illiterate; shut out from his rightful heirship  of all the ages.  Nor is it any more necessary that the social aristocrat--  ostentatiously useless, as he generally is--should hold virtual monopoly  of the elegancies of life.    But the commonplace 'gentleman' of fiction, who, without extraneous advantage,  and by mere virtue of caste-consciousness, and caste-eminence,  and caste-exclusiveness, doth bestride this narrow world like a colossus----    \"I am sorry to break in upon your meditations, Collins,\"  said Willoughby deprecatingly, turning towards me on his elbow,  \"but you know, Necessitas non habet leges.  I find myself without  the requisite for my normal bedtime solace; and I am unusually wakeful.  Could you spare me a pipeful of tobacco?\"    \"Certainly! Why did n't you mention it before?  I had no idea  you were a smoker.  I feel really vexed at your reticence.\"    \"Well, Mr. Thompson kindly lent me a supply this morning; but, unfortunately,  I had a hole in my pocket that I was not aware of, and--Thanks.  I'll just take a pipeful\"----    \"No, no; shove it in your pocket.  I've got more in my swag.  Been long in these colonies, Willoughby?\"    \"About a year.

Even in your cities I observe  a feverish excitement, and a demnable race for what the Scriptures aptly call  'filthy lucre'; and the pastoral regions are--well--rough indeed.  Your colonies are too young.  In time to come, no doubt, the amenities of life  will appear--for you have some magnificent private fortunes;  but in the meantime one hears of nothing but work--business--and so forth.  Cultivated leisure is a thing practically unknown.  However,  the country is merely passing through a necessary phase of development.  In the near future, each of these shabby home--stations will be replaced  by a noble mansion, with its spacious park; and these bare plains  will reward the toil of an industrious and contented tenantry\"----    \"Like (sheol)!\" sneered Mosey from his resting-place,--  a little crestfallen notwithstanding.    \"Irrigation, my dear Mosey, will meet the difficulty which very naturally  arises in your mind.  A scientific system of irrigation would increase  the letting value of this land more than a hundred-fold.  Now, if the State would carry out such a system--by Heaven!
