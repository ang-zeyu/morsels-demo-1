Was there any other charge against him, or had calumny triumphed  over the services he had rendered to his country? I have frequently  conversed with him on the subject of this adventure, and he invariably  assured me that he had nothing to reproach himself with, and that his  defence, which I shall subjoin, contained the pure expression of his  sentiments, and the exact truth.    In the following note, which he addressed to Albitte and Salicetti,  he makes no mention of Laporte. The copy which I possess is in the  handwriting of, Junot, with corrections in the General's hand. It  exhibits all the characteristics of Napoleon's writing: his short  sentences, his abrupt rather than concise style, sometimes his elevated  ideas, and always his plain good sense.      TO THE REPRESENTATIVES ALBITTE AND SALICETTI:   You have suspended me from my duties, put me under arrest, and declared me to be suspected.      Thus I am disgraced before being judged, or indeed judged before being heard.      In a revolutionary state there are two classes, the suspected and the patriots.      When the first are aroused, general measures are adopted towards them for the sake of security.      The oppression of the second class is a blow to public liberty. The magistrate cannot condemn until after the fullest evidence and a succession of facts. This leaves nothing to arbitrary decision.      To declare a patriot suspected is to deprive him of all that he most highly values--confidence and esteem.      In what class am I placed?      Since the commencement of the Revolution, have I not always been attached to its principles?      Have I not always been contending either with domestic enemies or foreign foes?      I sacrificed my home, abandoned my property, and lost everything for the Republic?      I have since served with some distinction at Toulon, and earned a part of the laurels of the army of Italy at the taking of Saorgio, Oneille, and Tanaro.      On the discovery of Robespierre's conspiracy, my conduct was that of a man accustomed to look only to principles.      My claim to the title of patriot, therefore cannot be disputed.      Why, then, am I declared suspected without being heard, and arrested eight days after I heard the news of the tyrant's death.      I am declared suspected, and my papers are placed under seal.      The reverse of this course ought to have been adopted. My papers should first have been sealed; then I should have been called on for my explanation; and, lastly, declared suspected, if there was reason for coming to, such a decision.      It is wished that I should go to Paris with an order which declares me suspected. It will naturally be presumed that the representatives did not draw up this decree without accurate information, and I shall be judged with the bias which a man of that class merits.      Though a patriot and an innocent and calumniated man, yet whatever measures may be adopted by the Committee I cannot complain.      If three men declare that I have committed a crime, I cannot complain of the jury who condemns me.      Salicetti, you know me; and I ask whether you have observed anything in my conduct for the last five years which can afford ground of suspicion?      Albitte, you do not know me; but you have received proof of no fact against me; you have not heard me, and you know how artfully the tongue of calumny sometimes works.      Must I then be confounded with the enemies of my country and ought the patriots inconsiderately to sacrifice a general who has not been useless to the Republic? Ought the representatives to reduce the Government to the necessity of being unjust and impolitic?      Hear me; destroy the oppression that overwhelms me, and restore me to the esteem of the patriots.      An hour after, if my enemies wish for my life, let them take it. I have often given proofs how little I value it. Nothing but the thought that I may yet be useful to my country makes me bear the burden of existence with courage.      It appears that this defence, which is remarkable for its energetic  simplicity, produced an effect on Albitte and Salicetti. Inquiries more  accurate, and probably more favourable to the General, were instituted;  and on the 3d Fructidor (20th August 1794) the representatives of the  people drew up a decree stating that, after a careful examination of  General Bonaparte's papers, and of the orders he had received relative  to his mission to Genoa, they saw nothing to justify any suspicion of  his conduct; and that, moreover, taking into consideration the advantage  that might accrue to the Republic from the military talents of the said  General Bonaparte, it was resolved that he should be provisionally set  at liberty.         --[With reference to the arrest of Bonaparte (which lasted thirteen     days) see 'Bourrienne et ses Erreurs', tome i. pp. 16-28, and Iung,     tome ii. pp. 443-457. Both, in opposition to Bourrienne, attribute     the arrest to his connection with the younger Robespierre.     Apparently Albitte and Salicetti wets not acquainted with the secret     plan of campaign prepared by the younger Robespierre and by     Bonaparte, or with the real instructions given for the mission to     Genoa. Jealousy between the representatives in the staff of the     army of the Alps and those with the army of Italy, with which     Napoleon was, also played a part in the affair. Iung looks on     Salicetti as acting as the protector of the Bonapartes; but Napoleon     does not seem to have regarded him in that light; see the letter     given in Tunot, vol. i. p. 106, where in 1795 he takes credit for     not returning the ill done to him; see also the same volume, p. 89.     Salicetti eventually became Minister of Police to Joseph, when King     of Naples, in 1806; but when he applied to return to France,     Napoleon said to Mathieu Dumas, \"Let him know that I am not powerful     enough to protect the wretches who voted for the death of Louis XVI.     from the contempt and indignation of the public\" (Dumas, tome iii.     p. 318). At the same time Napoleon described Salicetti as worse     than the lazzaroni.]--    Salicetti afterwards became the friend and confidant of young Bonaparte;  but their intimacy did not continue after his elevation.    What is to be thought of the motives for Bonaparte's arrest and  provisional liberation, when his innocence and the error that had been  committed were acknowledged? The importance of the General's military  talents, though no mention is made about the impossibility of dispensing  with them, is a pretence for restoring him to that liberty of which he  had been unjustly deprived.    It was not at Toulon, as has been stated, that Bonaparte took Duroc into  the artillery, and made him his 'aide de camp'.         --[Michel Duroc (1773-1813) at first only aide de camp to Napoleon,     was several times entrusted with special diplomatic missions (for     example, to Berlin, etc.) On the formation of the Empire he became     Grand Marechal du Palais, and Duc de Frioul. He always remained in     close connection with Napoleon until he was killed in 1813. As he     is often mentioned in contemporary memoirs under his abbreviated     title of 'Marshal', he has sometimes been erroneously included in     the number of the Marshals of the Empire--a military rank he never     attained to.]--    The acquaintance was formed at a subsequent period, in Italy. Duroc's  cold character and unexcursive mind suited Napoleon, whose confidence  he enjoyed until his death, and who entrusted him with missions perhaps  above his abilities. At St. Helena Bonaparte often declared that he was  much attached to Duroc. I believe this to be true; but I know that the  attachment was not returned. The ingratitude of princes is proverbial.  May it not happen that courtiers are also sometimes ungrateful?--[It is  only just to Duroc to add that this charge does not seem borne out by  the impressions of those more capable than Bourrienne of judging in the  matter.]            CHAPTER III.     1794-1795.

General Bonaparte returned to Paris, where I also arrived from Germany  shortly after him. Our intimacy was resumed, and he gave me an account  of, all that had passed in the campaign of the south. He frequently  alluded to the persecutions he had suffered, and he delivered to me the  packet of papers noticed in the last chapter, desiring me to communicate  their contents to my friends. He was very anxious, he said, to do away  with the supposition that he was capable of betraying his country,  and, under the pretence of a mission to Genoa, becoming a SPY on the  interests of France. He loved to talk over his military achievements at  Toulon and in Italy. He spoke of his first successes with that feeling  of pleasure and gratification which they were naturally calculated to  excite in him.    The Government wished to send him to La Vendée, with the rank of  brigadier-general of infantry. Bonaparte rejected this proposition on  two grounds. He thought the scene of action unworthy of his talents, and  he regarded his projected removal from the artillery to the infantry as  a sort of insult. This last was his most powerful objection, and was the  only one he urged officially. In consequence of his refusal to accept  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#11)"],[1,"passages as _Troilus and Cressida_: Act I, sc. 3;  _King John_, Act III, sc. 1; and _Merry Wives_, Act III, sc. 2,  indicate that Shakespeare accepted fully the Ptolemaic conception of a  central, immovable earth. See also Beyersdorf: _op. cit._]    Leaving Paris soon after his return thither, Bruno wandered into  southern Germany. At Marburg he was not permitted to teach, but at  Wittenberg the Lutherans cordially welcomed him into the university.  After a stay of a year and a half, he moved on to Prague for a few  months, then to Helmstadt, Frankfort and Zurich, and back to Frankfort  again where, in 1591, he received an invitation from a young Venetian  patrician, Moecenigo, to come to Venice as his tutor. He re-entered  Italy, therefore, in August, much to the amazement of his  contemporaries. It is probable that Moecenigo was acting for the  Inquisition.[218] At any rate, he soon denounced Bruno to that body  and in May, 1592, surrendered him to it.[219]    [Footnote 218: McIntyre: 68.]    [Footnote 219: Ibid: 47-72.]    In his trial before the Venetian Inquisition,[220] Bruno told the  story of his life and stated his beliefs in answer to the charges  against him, based mainly on travesties of his opinions. In this  statement as well as in _La Cena de le Ceneri_, and in _De Immenso et  Innumerabilis_,[221] Bruno shows how completely he had not merely  accepted the Copernican doctrine, but had expanded it far beyond its  author's conception. The universe according to Copernicus, though  vastly greater than that conceived by Aristotle and Ptolemy, was still  finite because enclosed within the sphere of the fixed stars. Bruno  declared that not only was the earth only a lesser planet, but \"this  world itself was merely one of an infinite number of particular worlds  similar to this, and that all the planets and other stars are infinite  worlds without number composing an infinite universe, so that there is  a double infinitude, that of the greatness of the universe, and that  of the multitude of worlds.\"[222] How important this would be to the  Church authorities may be realized by recalling the patristic doctrine  that the universe was created for man and that his home is its center.  Of course their cherished belief must be defended from such an attack,  and naturally enough, the Copernican doctrine as the starting point of  Bruno's theory of an infinite universe was thus brought into  question;[223] for, as M. Berti has said,[224] Bruno's doctrine was  equally an astro-theology or a theological astronomy.    [Footnote 220: See official documents in Berti: 327-395.]    [Footnote 221: Bruno: _De Immenso et Innumerabilis_: Lib. III, cap. 9  (vol. 1, pt. 1, 380-386).]    [Footnote 222: Thayer: 268.]    [Footnote 223: Berti: 285.]    [Footnote 224: Ibid: 282.]    The Roman Inquisition was not content to let the Venetian court deal  with this arch heretic, but wrote in September, 1592, demanding his  extradition. The Venetian body referred its consent to the state for  ratification which the Doge and Council refused to grant. Finally,  when the Papal Nuncio had represented that Bruno was not a Venetian  but a Neapolitan, and that cases against him were still outstanding  both in Naples and in Rome, the state consented, and in February of  the next year, Bruno entered Rome, a prisoner of the Inquisition.  Nothing further is known about him until the Congregations took up his  case on February 4th, 1599. Perhaps Pope Clement had hoped to win back  to the true faith this prince of heretics.[225] However Bruno stood  firm, and early in the following year he was degraded, sentenced and  handed over to the secular authorities, who burned him at the stake in  the Campo di Fiori, February 17, 1600.[226] All his books were put on  the Index by decree of February 8, 1600, (where they remain to this  day), and as a consequence they became extremely rare. It is well to  remember Bruno's fate, when considering Galileo's case, for  Galileo[227] was at that time professor of mathematics in the  university of Padua and fully cognizant of the event.    [Footnote 225: Fahie: 82-89.]    [Footnote 226: Thayer: 299.]    [Footnote 227: The publication of A. Favaro's _Galileo e  l'Inquisizione: Documenti del Processo Galileiano ... per la prima  volta integralmente pubblicati_, (Firenze, 1907), together with that  of the National Edition (in 20 vols.) of Galileo's works, edited by  Favaro (Firenze, completed 1909), renders somewhat obsolete all  earlier lives of Galileo. The more valuable, however, of these books  are: Martin's _Galilee_ (Paris, 1868), a scholarly Catholic study  containing valuable bibliographical notes; Anon. (Mrs. Olney):  _Private Life of Galileo_, based largely on his correspondence with  his daughter from which many extracts are given; and von Gebler's  _Galileo Galilei and the Roman Curia_ (trans. by Mrs. Sturge, London,  1879), which includes in the appendix the various decrees in the  original. Fahie's _Life of Galileo_ (London, 1903), is based on  Favaro's researches and is reliable. The documents of the trial have  been published in part by de l'Epinois, von Gebler and Berti, but  Favaro's is the complete and authoritative edition.]    Galileo's father, though himself a skilled mathematician, had  intended that his son (born at Pisa, February 15, 1564), should be a  cloth-dealer, but at length permitted him to study medicine instead at  the university of Pisa, after an elementary education at the monastery  of Vallombrosa near Florence. At the Tuscan Court in Pisa, Galileo  received his first lesson in mathematics, which thereupon became his  absorbing interest. After nearly four years he withdrew from the  university to Florence and devoted himself to that science and to  physics. His services as a professor at this time were refused by five  of the Italian universities; finally, in 1589, he obtained the  appointment to the chair of physics at Pisa. He became so unpopular  there, however, through his attacks on the Aristotelian physics of the  day, that after three years he resigned and accepted a similar  position at Padua.[228] He remained here nearly eighteen years till  his longing for leisure in which to pursue his researches, and the  patronage of his good friend, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, brought him a  professorship at the university of Pisa again, this time without  obligation of residence nor of lecturing. He took up his residence in  Florence in 1610; and later (1626), purchased a villa at Arcetri  outside the city, in order to be near the convent where his favorite  daughter \"Suor Maria Celeste\" was a religious.[229]    [Footnote 228: Fahie: 20-40.]    [Footnote 229: Ibid: 121.]    During the greater part of his lectureship at Padua, Galileo taught  according to the Ptolemaic cosmogony out of compliance with popular  feeling, though himself a Copernican. In a letter to Kepler (August 4,  1597)[230] he speaks of his entire acceptance of the new system for  some years; but not until after the appearance of the New Star in the  heavens in 1604 and 1605, and the controversy that its appearance  aroused over the Aristotelian notion of the perfect and unchangeable  heavens, did he publicly repudiate the old scheme and teach the new.  The only information we have as to how he came to adopt the Copernican  scheme for himself is the account given by \"_Sagredo_,\" Galileo's  spokesman in the famous _Dialogue on the Two Principal Systems_  (1632):         \"Being very young and having scarcely finished my course of       Philosophy which I left off, as being set upon other       employments, there chanced to come into these parts a       certain foreigner of Rostock, whose name as I remember, was       Christianus Vurstitius, a follower of Copernicus, who in an       Academy made two or three lectures upon this point, to whom       many flock't as auditors; but I thinking they went more for       the novelty of the subject than otherwise, did not go to       hear him; for I had concluded with myself that that opinion       could be no other than a solemn madnesse. And questioning       some of those who had been there, I perceived they all made       a jest thereof, except one, who told me that the business       was not altogether to be laugh't at, and because this man       was reputed by me to be very intelligent and wary, I       repented that I was not there, and began from that time       forward as oft as I met with anyone of the Copernican       persuasion, to demand of them, if they had always been of       the same judgment; and of as many as I examined, I found not       so much as one, who told me not that he had been a long time       of the contrary opinion, but to have changed it for this, as       convinced by the reasons proving the same: and afterwards       questioning them, one by one, to see whether they were well       possest of the reasons of the other side, I found them all       to be very ready and perfect in them; so that I could not       truly say that they had took up this opinion out of       ignorance, vanity, or to show the acuteness of their wits.       On the contrary, of as many of the Peripateticks and       Ptolemeans as I have asked (and out of curiosity I have       talked with many) what pains they had taken in the Book of       Copernicus, I found very few that had so much as       superficially perused it: but of those whom, I thought, had       understood the same, not one; and moreover, I have enquired       amongst the followers of the Peripatetick Doctrine, if ever       any of them had held the contrary opinion, and likewise       found that none had. Whereupon considering that there was no       man who followed the opinion of Copernicus that had not been       first on the contrary side, and that was not very well       acquainted with the reasons of Aristotle and Ptolemy; and on       the contrary, that there is not one of the followers of"]]]
