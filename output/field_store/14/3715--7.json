The Thames by evening in June, memories that reached from Tacitus to  Wordsworth, the embrasure that extends in front of the Egyptian obelisk  for a standing place, and some children \"swimming a dog\";--that was the  scene and circumstance of my first meeting with his father. A man  of middle age was standing by. He wore the flashings of a  Lieutenant-Colonel and for badges the Artillery grenades. He seemed  a friendly man; and under the influence of the moment, which he also  surely felt, I spoke to him.    \"A fine river,\"--That was a safe remark.    \"But I know a finer.\"    \"Pharpar and Abana?\" I put the stranger to the test.    \"No,\" he said. \"The St. Lawrence is not of Damascus.\" He had answered to  the sign, and looked at my patches.    \"I have a son in France, myself,\" he said. \"His name is McCrae.\"    \"Not John McCrae?\"    \"John McCrae is my son.\"    The resemblance was instant, but this was an older man than at first  sight he seemed to be. I asked him to dinner at Morley's, my place of  resort for a length of time beyond the memory of all but the oldest  servants. He had already dined but he came and sat with me, and told me  marvellous things.    David McCrae had raised, and trained, a field battery in Guelph, and  brought it overseas. He was at the time upwards of seventy years of age,  and was considered on account of years alone \"unfit\" to proceed to the  front. For many years he had commanded a field battery in the Canadian  militia, went on manoeuvres with his \"cannons\", and fired round shot.  When the time came for using shells he bored the fuse with a gimlet; and  if the gimlet were lost in the grass, the gun was out of action until  the useful tool could be found. This \"cannon ball\" would travel over the  country according to the obstacles it encountered and, \"if it struck a  man, it might break his leg.\"    In such a martial atmosphere the boy was brought up, and he was early  nourished with the history of the Highland regiments. Also from his  father he inherited, or had instilled into him, a love of the out of  doors, a knowledge of trees, and plants, a sympathy with birds and  beasts, domestic and wild. When the South African war broke out a  contingent was dispatched from Canada, but it was so small that few of  those desiring to go could find a place. This explains the genesis of  the following letter:      I see by to-night's bulletin that there is to be no second contingent. I  feel sick with disappointment, and do not believe that I have ever been  so disappointed in my life, for ever since this business began I am  certain there have not been fifteen minutes of my waking hours that it  has not been in my mind. It has to come sooner or later. One campaign  might cure me, but nothing else ever will, unless it should be old age.  I regret bitterly that I did not enlist with the first, for I doubt if  ever another chance will offer like it. This is not said in ignorance of  what the hardships would be.    I am ashamed to say I am doing my work in a merely mechanical way. If  they are taking surgeons on the other side, I have enough money to get  myself across. If I knew any one over there who could do anything, I  would certainly set about it. If I can get an appointment in England  by going, I will go. My position here I do not count as an old boot in  comparison.      In the end he accomplished the desire of his heart, and sailed on the  'Laurentian'. Concerning the voyage one transcription will be enough:      On orderly duty. I have just been out taking the picket at 11.30 P.M. In  the stables the long row of heads in the half-darkness, the creaking of  the ship, the shivering of the hull from the vibration of the engines,  the sing of a sentry on the spar deck to some passer-by. Then to the  forward deck: the sky half covered with scudding clouds, the stars  bright in the intervals, the wind whistling a regular blow that tries  one's ears, the constant swish as she settles down to a sea; and,  looking aft, the funnel with a wreath of smoke trailing away off into  the darkness on the starboard quarter; the patch of white on the funnel  discernible dimly; the masts drawing maps across the sky as one looks  up; the clank of shovels coming up through the ventilators,--if you have  ever been there, you know it all.    There was a voluntary service at six; two ships' lanterns and the men  all around, the background of sky and sea, and the strains of \"Nearer  my God to Thee\" rising up in splendid chorus. It was a very effective  scene, and it occurred to me that THIS was \"the rooibaatjees singing on  the road,\" as the song says.          The next entry is from South Africa:        Green Point Camp, Capetown,    February 25th, 1900.    You have no idea of the WORK. Section commanders live with their  sections, which is the right way. It makes long hours. I never knew a  softer bed than the ground is these nights. I really enjoy every minute  though there is anxiety. We have lost all our spare horses. We have only  enough to turn out the battery and no more.      After a description of a number of the regiments camped near by them, he  speaks of the Indian troops, and then says:      We met the High Priest of it all, and I had a five minutes' chat with  him--Kipling I mean. He visited the camp. He looks like his pictures,  and is very affable. He told me I spoke like a Winnipeger. He said we  ought to \"fine the men for drinking unboiled water. Don't give them  C.B.; it is no good. Fine them, or drive common sense into them. All  Canadians have common sense.\"          The next letter is from the Lines of Communication:        Van Wyks Vlei,    March 22nd, 1900.    Here I am with my first command. Each place we strike is a little more  God-forsaken than the last, and this place wins up to date. We marched  last week from Victoria west to Carnovan, about 80 miles. We stayed  there over Sunday, and on Monday my section was detached with mounted  infantry, I being the only artillery officer. We marched 54 miles in  37 hours with stops; not very fast, but quite satisfactory. My horse is  doing well, although very thin. Night before last on the road we halted,  and I dismounted for a minute. When we started I pulled on the lines but  no answer. The poor old chap was fast asleep in his tracks, and in about  thirty seconds too.    This continuous marching is really hard work. The men at every halt just  drop down in the road and sleep until they are kicked up again in ten  minutes. They do it willingly too. I am commanding officer, adjutant,  officer on duty, and all the rest since we left the main body. Talk  about the Army in Flanders! You should hear this battalion. I always  knew soldiers could swear, but you ought to hear these fellows. I am  told the first contingent has got a name among the regulars.          Three weeks later he writes:        April 10th, 1900.    We certainly shall have done a good march when we get to the railroad,  478 miles through a country desolate of forage carrying our own  transport and one-half rations of forage, and frequently the men's  rations. For two days running we had nine hours in the saddle without  food. My throat was sore and swollen for a day or two, and I felt  so sorry for myself at times that I laughed to think how I must have  looked: sitting on a stone, drinking a pan of tea without trimmings,  that had got cold, and eating a shapeless lump of brown bread; my one  \"hank\" drawn around my neck, serving as hank and bandage alternately. It  is miserable to have to climb up on one's horse with a head like a  buzz saw, the sun very hot, and \"gargle\" in one's water bottle. It is  surprising how I can go without water if I have to on a short stretch,  that is, of ten hours in the sun. It is after nightfall that the thirst  really seems to attack one and actually gnaws. One thinks of all the  cool drinks and good things one would like to eat. Please understand  that this is not for one instant in any spirit of growling.      The detail was now established at Victoria Road. Three entries appear*:           * I only count two. . . .  A. L., 1995.        April 23rd, 1900.    We are still here in camp hoping for orders to move, but they have not  yet come. Most of the other troops have gone. A squadron of the M.C.R.,  my messmates for the past five weeks, have gone and I am left an orphan.  I was very sorry to see them go. They, in the kindness of their hearts,  say, if I get stranded, they will do the best they can to get a troop  for me in the squadron or some such employment. Impracticable, but kind.  I have no wish to cease to be a gunner.        Victoria Road, May 20th, 1900.    The horses are doing as well as one can expect, for the rations are  insufficient. Our men have been helping to get ready a rest camp near  us, and have been filling mattresses with hay. Every fatigue party comes  back from the hospital, their jackets bulging with hay for the horses.  Two bales were condemned as too musty to put into the mattresses, and we  were allowed to take them for the horses. They didn't leave a spear of  it. Isn't it pitiful? Everything that the heart of man and woman can  devise has been sent out for the \"Tommies\", but no one thinks of the  poor horses. They get the worst of it all the time. Even now we blush to  see the handful of hay that each horse gets at a feed.      The Boer War is so far off in time and space that a few further detached  references must suffice:      When riding into Bloemfontein met Lord----'s funeral at the cemetery  gates,--band, firing party, Union Jack, and about three companies. A  few yards farther on a \"Tommy\" covered only by his blanket, escorted  by thirteen men all told, the last class distinction that the world can  ever make.      We had our baptism of fire yesterday. They opened on us from the left  flank. Their first shell was about 150 yards in front--direction good.

A lady has fainted!\"    For a moment all was forgotten, save the white face that had fallen back  upon her friend's shoulder, and that seemed even whiter because of the  black garments, and beneath the halo of fair blonde hair.    \"It was that,\" explained the friend, who proved to be a Mrs. Arthur,  pointing toward the shrouded figure in the inner room. \"She has been  growing more and more nervous for some time.\"    Robert Brierly was the first at her side, but, as the doctor took his  place and he drew back a pace, a hand touched his arm.    \"Step aside,\" whispered Ferrars, \"where she cannot see you.\" And without  comprehending but answering a look in the detective's eye, he obeyed.    Mrs. Jamieson did not at once recover, and the doctor and Ferrars  carried her across the hall and into the room lately occupied by  Brierly. As Mrs. Arthur followed them, it seemed to her that the  detective, whom of course she did not know as such, was assuming the  leadership, and that half a dozen quick words were spoken by him to the  doctor, across her friend's drooping head.    \"She must be removed immediately,\" said the doctor a moment after. \"Let  some one find a carriage or phaeton at once.\" Then, as Ferrars did not  move from his place beside the bed where they had placed the unconscious  woman, he strode to the chamber door, said a word or two to Doran, who  had followed them as far as the door, and came back to his place beside  the bed.    Before Mrs. Jamieson had opened her eyes a low wagonette was at the  door, and when the lady became conscious and had been raised and given a  stimulating draught, she was lifted again by Ferrars and Doctor Barnes  and carried to the waiting vehicle, followed by Mrs. Arthur.    \"Kindly take the place beside the driver, madam,\" directed the doctor.  \"My friend will go with the lady and assist her; it will be best. It is  possible that she may faint again.\" And so they drove away, Mrs. Arthur  beside Doran, the driver; and Mrs. Jamieson, still pallid and tremulous,  leaning upon the supporting shoulder of Ferrars, silent and with closed  eyes.    As he lifted her from the wagonette, and assisted her up the steps and  within the door, however, the lady seemed to recover herself with an  effort. She had crossed the threshold supported by Ferrars on the one  side, and leaning upon her friend's arm upon the other, and at the door  of the reception room she turned, saying faintly:    \"Let me rest here first. Before we go upstairs, I mean.\" Then,  withdrawing her hand from her friend's arm, she seemed to steady  herself, and standing more erect, turned to Ferrars.    \"I must not trouble you longer, now, sir. You have been most kind.\" Her  voice faltered, she paused a moment, and then held out her hand. \"I  should like very much to hear the outcome,\" she hesitated.    \"With your permission,\" the detective replied quickly, \"I will call to  ask after your welfare, and to inform you if I can.\" He turned to go,  but she made a movement toward him.    \"That poor girl,\" she said, \"I pity her so. Do you know her well, sir?\"  She was quite herself now, but her voice was still weak and tremulous.    \"You have not heard, I see, that she is my cousin.\"    \"No. I would like to call upon her. Will you ask her if I may?\" He  nodded and she added quickly, \"And call, if you please, to-morrow.\"    Robert Brierly told his story almost without interruption; all that he  knew of his brother's life in the village; of his own; of his coming  earlier than he was expected, and of his firm belief that his brother  had been made the victim of foul play. Possibly killed by mistake,  because of some fancied resemblance; for his life, which had been like  an open book to all his friends, held no secrets, no \"episodes,\" and  enemies he never had one. In short, he could throw no light upon the  mystery of his brother's death. Rather, his story made that death seem  more mysterious than at first because of the possibilities that it  rendered at least probable.    But this evidence had its effect upon a somewhat bucolic jury. That  Charles Brierly had been shot by another hand than his own had been very  clearly demonstrated, for his brother would have no doubt whatever left  upon this point; while he little knew how much the judicious whispers  and hints uttered in the right places, and with apparent intent of  confidence and secrecy, had to do with the shaping of the verdict, which  was as follows:           \"We, the jury, find that the deceased, Charles Brierly, died from a       bullet wound, fired, according to our belief, by mistake or       accident, and at the hands of some person unknown.\"      And now came the question of proof.    \"It must be cleared up,\" said Robert Brierly to the detective. \"I am  not a rich man, Mr. Ferrars, but all that I have shall be spent at need  to bring the truth to light. For I can never rest until I have learned  it. It is my duty to my dead brother, father, mother--all.\"    And late that night, alone in his room he looked out upon the stars hung  low upon the eastern horizon and murmured--    \"Ah, Ruth, Ruth, we were far enough asunder before, and now--Ah, it was  well to have left you your freedom, for now the gulf is widening; it may  soon, it will soon be impassable.\" And he sighed heavily, as a strong  man sighs when the tears are very near his eyes and the pain close to  his heart.          CHAPTER VIII.    TRICKERY.      As was quite natural, the three men, thrown so strangely and  unexpectedly together at the doctor's cottage, sat up late after the  inquest, and discussed the strange death of Charles Brierly in all its  bearings. As a result of this they slept somewhat late, except the  detective, who let himself out of the house at sunrise, and lighting a  cigar, set off for a short walk, up one certain street, and down  another. He walked slowly, and looked indolently absorbed in his cigar.  But it was a very observant eye that noted, from under the peak of his  English cap, the streets, the houses, and the very few stray people whom  he passed. It was not the people, though, in whom he was chiefly  interested. Ferrars was intently studying the topography of the town, at  least of that portion of it which he was then traversing with such  seeming aimlessness.    From the doctor's cottage he had sauntered north for several blocks,  crossed over, until he reached the upper or terraced street, and  followed it until he had reached the southern edge of the village and  was in sight of the school-house not far beyond. Turning here he crossed  a street or two, and was nearing the house where the dead school teacher  had lived, when he saw the front door of the house open, and a woman  come out and hasten away in the direction in which he was moving. She  hurried on like one intent upon some absorbing errand, and, knowing the  house as the late home of Charles Brierly, and the woman as its  mistress, Ferrars quickened his steps that he might keep her in sight,  and when she turned the corner leading directly to the doctor's cottage  he further increased his speed, feeling instinctively that her errand,  whatever its nature, would take her there.    He was not far behind her now, and he saw the doctor standing alone upon  the side porch, saw the woman enter at the side gate, and the meeting of  the two.    Mrs. Fry, with her back towards him, was making excited gestures, and  the face of the doctor, visible above her head, changed from a look of  mild wonder to such sudden anxiety and amazement that the detective  halted at the gate, hesitating, and was seen at that instant by the  doctor, who beckoned him on with a look of relief.    \"Look here, Ferrars,\" he began, and then turned to assure himself that  Brierly had not arisen, and was not observing them from the office  window. \"Come this way a few steps,\" moving away from the porch and  halting where the shadow of the wing hid them from view from within the  main dwelling. \"And now, Mrs. Fry, please tell Mr. Grant what you had  begun to tell me. I want his opinion on it. He's not a bad lawyer.\"    \"A good detective'd be the right thing, I think,\" declared the woman.  \"It's about Mr. Brierly's room, sir. He had a small bedroom, and another  opening out from it, where he used to read and study. You know how they  were, doctor!\"    The doctor nodded silently.    \"Well, last night, you remember, when you brought this gentleman and his  brother to my place to look at the rooms. You or he decided not to go up  then, but told me to close the rooms, and he would come  to-morrow--to-day--that would be.\"    \"Yes, yes!\" said the doctor, impatiently, \"we remember all that, Mrs.  Fry.\"    \"Well, I'd had the rooms locked ever since I heard that he was dead.\"  Mrs. Fry was growing somewhat hazy as to her pronouns. \"And I had the  key in my pocket. Then, well, after a while I lit the lamp in the  sittin' room so's it wouldn't seem so gloomy in the house, and went out  and sat on my side stoop, and after a little my neighbour on that side,  Mrs. Robson, came acrost the lawn--there aint no fence between, ye  know--and we talked for some time, and my little girl fell asleep with  her head in my lap.\"    \"Don't be too long with the story,\" broke in the doctor. \"I don't want  it to spoil Mr. Brierly's breakfast, for he needs it badly.\"    \"Yes, sir. Well, just about that time--it must have been half-past  eight, I guess--and there was plenty of folks all along the street, a  boy came running across the lawn and right up to me.    \"'If you please,' he says, touching his hat rim, 'Mr. Brierly, down to  the doctor's, forgot to get the key to his brother's room, and he sent  me to get it for him.' I s'pose I was foolish. I felt hurt, thinkin' he  couldn't trust me"]]]
