I have also heard a robin that sang to perfection the song of the  brown thrasher; it had, no doubt, caught it by imitation. I have heard  another robin that had the call of the quail interpolated into its own  proper robin's song. But I have yet to hear of a robin building a nest  like a brown thrasher, or of an oriole building a nest like a robin,  or of kingfishers drilling for grubs in a tree. The hen cannot keep  out of the water the ducks she has hatched, nor can the duck coax into  the water the chickens she has hatched. The cowbird hatched and  reared by the sparrow, or the warbler, or the vireo does not sing the  song of the foster-parent. Why? Did its parent not try to teach it? I  have no evidence that young birds sing, except occasionally in a low,  tentative kind of way, till they return the following season, and then  birds of a feather flock together, robins staying with robins, and  cowbirds with cowbirds, each singing the song of its species. The  songs of bobolinks differ in different localities, but those of the  same locality always sing alike. I once had a caged skylark that  imitated the songs of nearly every bird in my neighborhood.    Mr. Leander S. Keyser, author of \"Birds of the Rockies,\" relates in  \"Forest and Stream\" the results of his experiments with a variety of  birds taken from the nest while very young and reared in captivity;  among them meadowlarks, red-winged blackbirds, brown thrashers, blue  jays, wood thrushes, catbirds, flickers, woodpeckers, and several  others. Did they receive any parental instruction? Not a bit of it,  and yet at the proper age they flew, perched, called, and sang like  their wild fellows--all except the robins and the red-winged  blackbirds: these did not sing the songs of their species, but sang a  medley made up of curious imitations of human and other sounds. And  the blue jay never learned to sing \"the sweet gurgling roulade of the  wild jays,\" though it gave the blue jay call correctly. Mr. Keyser's  experiment was interesting and valuable, but his sagacity fails him  when interpreting the action of the jay in roosting in an exposed  place after it had been given its liberty. He thinks this showed how  little instinct can be relied on, and how much the bird needed  parental instruction. Could he not see that the artificial life of the  bird in the cage had demoralized its instincts, and that acquired  habits had supplanted native tendencies? The bird had learned to be  unafraid in the cage, and why should it be afraid out of the cage?  This reminds me of a letter from a correspondent: he had a tame crow  that was not afraid of a gun; therefore he concluded that the old  crows must instill the fear of guns into their young! Why should the  crow be afraid of a gun, if it had learned not to be afraid of the  gunner?    I have seen a young chickadee fly late in the day from the nest in the  cavity of a tree straight to a pear-tree, where it perched close to  the trunk and remained unregarded by its parents till next morning.  But no doubt its parents had given it minute directions before it left  the nest how to fly and where to perch!    That animals learn by experience in a limited way is very certain. Yet  that old birds build better nests or sing better than young ones it  would be hard to prove, though it seems reasonable that it should be  so.    Rarely does one see nests of the same species of varying degrees of  excellence--that is, first nests in the spring. The second nest of any  species is likely to be a more hurried and incomplete affair. Some  species are at all times poor nest-builders, as the cuckoos and the  pigeons. Other birds are good nest-builders, as the orioles, the  thrushes, the finches, the warblers, the hummingbirds, and one never  finds an inferior specimen of the nests of any of these birds. There  is probably no more improvement in this respect among birds than there  is among insects.    I have no proof that wild birds improve in singing. One does not hear  a vireo, or a finch, or a thrush, or a warbler that is noticeably  inferior as a songster to its fellows; their songs are all alike,  except in the few rare cases when one hears a master songster among  its kind; but whether this mastery is natural or acquired, who shall  tell?    What birds learn about migration, if anything, I do not see that we  have any means of finding out.    It has been observed of birds reared under artificial conditions that  the young males practice a long time before they sing well. That this  is true of wild birds, there is no proof. What birds and animals learn  by experience is greater cunning. Does not even an old trout know more  about hooks than a young one? Birds of any kind that are much hunted  become wilder, even though they have not had the experience of being  shot. Ask any duck or grouse or quail hunter if this is not so. Our  ruffed grouse learns to fly with a corkscrew motion where it is much  fired at on the wing. How wary and cautious the fox becomes in regions  where it is much trapped and hunted! Even the woodchuck becomes very  wild on the farms where it is much shot at, and this wildness extends  to its young. In his \"Wilderness Hunter\" President Roosevelt says the  same thing of the big game of the Rockies. Antelope and deer can be  lured near the concealed hunter by the waving of a small flag till  they are shot at a few times. Then they see through the trick. \"The  burnt child fears the fire.\" Animals profit by experience in this way;  they learn what not to do. In the accumulation of positive knowledge,  so far as we know, they make little or no progress. Birds and beasts  will adapt themselves more or less to their environment, but plants  and trees will do that, too. The rats in Jamaica have learned to nest  in trees to escape the mongoose, but this is only the triumph of the  instinct of self-preservation. The mongoose has not yet learned to  climb trees; the pressure of need is not yet great enough. It is said  that in districts subject to floods moor-hens often build in trees.  All animals will change their habits under pressure of necessity; man  changes his without this pressure. The Duke of Argyll saw a bald eagle  seize a fish in the stream--an unusual proceeding; but the eagle was  doubtless very hungry, and there was no osprey near upon whom to levy  tribute.    Romanes found that rats would get certain semi-liquid foods out of a  bottle with their tails, as a cat will get milk out of a jar with her  paw, but neither ever progresses so far as to use any sort of tool for  the purpose, or to tip the vessel over. Animals practice concealment  to secure their prey, but not deception, as man does. They do not use  lures or disguises, or traps or poison.    There is, of course, no limit to the variety and adaptiveness of  nature taken as a whole, but each species is hedged about by  impassable limitations. The ouzel is akin to the thrushes, and yet it  lives along and in the water. Does it ever take to the fields and  woods, and live on fruit and land-insects, and nest in trees like  other thrushes? So with all birds and beasts. They vary constantly,  but not in one lifetime, and the sum of these variations, accumulated  through natural selection, as Darwin has shown, gives rise, in the  course of long periods of time, to new species.    As I have already said, domestic animals vary more than wild ones.  Every farmer and poultry-grower knows that some hens are better with  chickens than others--more motherly, more careful--and rear a greater  number of their brood. The same is true of sows with pigs. Some sows  will eat their pigs, and wild animals in cages often destroy their  young. Some ewes will not own their lambs, and occasionally a cow will  not own her calf. (Such cases show perverted or demoralized  instinct.) Similar to these are the strange friendships that sometimes  occur among the domestic animals, as that of a sheep with a cow, a  goose with a horse, or a hen adopting kittens. In a state of nature  these curious attachments probably never spring up. Instinct is likely  to be more or less demoralized when animal life touches human life.    With the wild creatures we sometimes see one instinct overcoming  another, as when fear drives a bird to desert its nest, or when the  instinct of migration leads a pair of swallows to desert their  unfledged young.    A great many young birds come to grief by leaving the nest before they  can fly. In such cases, I suppose, they disobey the parental  instructions! I find it easier to believe that instinct is at fault,  or that one instinct has overcome another; something has disturbed or  alarmed the young birds, and the fear of danger has led them to  attempt flight before their wings were strong enough. Once, when I was  climbing up to the nest of a broad-winged hawk, the young took fright  and launched out in the air, coming to the ground only a few rods  away.    Instinct, natural prompting, is the main matter, after all. It makes  up at least nine tenths of the lives of all our wild neighbors. How  much has fear had to do in shaping their lives and in perpetuating  them! And \"fear of any particular enemy,\" says Darwin, \"is certainly  an instinctive quality.\" It has been said that kittens confined in a  box, and which have never known a dog, will spit and put up their  backs at a hand that has just stroked a dog,--even before their eyes  are opened, one authority says, but this I doubt. My son's tame gray  squirrel had never seen chestnuts, nor learned about them in the  school of the woods, and yet when he was offered some, he fairly  danced with excitement; he put his paws eagerly around them and drew  them to him, and chattered, and looked threateningly at all about him.  Does man know his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#11)"],[1,"admirers, but on  account of his criticisms of his superior officers it gained him even  more enemies.    This is a specimen of the kind of thing that caused the retired army  officer to sit up and choke with apoplexy:    \"General Kitchener, who never spares himself, cares little for others.  He treated all men like machines, from the private soldiers, whose  salutes he disdained, to the superior officers, whom he rigidly  controlled. The comrade who had served with him and under him for many  years, in peace and peril, was flung aside as soon as he ceased to be of  use. The wounded Egyptian and even the wounded British soldier did not  excite his interest.\"    When in the service clubs they read that, the veterans asked each other  their favorite question of what is the army coming to, and to their  own satisfaction answered it by pointing out that when a lieutenant of  twenty-four can reprimand the commanding general the army is going to  the dogs.    To the newspapers, hundreds of them, over their own signatures, on  the service club stationery, wrote violent, furious letters, and the  newspapers themselves, besides the ordinary reviews, gave to the book  editorial praise and editorial condemnation.    Equally disgusted were the younger officers of the service. They  nicknamed his book \"A Subaltern's Advice to Generals,\" and called  Churchill himself a \"Medal Snatcher.\" A medal snatcher is an officer  who, whenever there is a rumor of war, leaves his men to the care of  any one, and through influence in high places and for the sake of the  campaign medal has himself attached to the expeditionary force. But  Churchill never was a medal hunter. The routine of barrack life irked  him, and in foreign parts he served his country far better than by  remaining at home and inspecting awkward squads and attending guard  mount. Indeed, the War Office could cover with medals the man who wrote  \"The Story of the Malakand Field Force\" and \"The River War\" and still be  in his debt.    In October, 1898, a month after the battle of Omdurman, Churchill  made his debut as a political speaker at minor meetings in Dover and  Rotherhithe. History does not record that these first speeches set fire  to the Channel. During the winter he finished and published his \"River  War,\" and in the August of the following summer, 1899, at a by-election,  offered himself as Member of Parliament for Oldham.    In the _Daily Telegraph_ his letters from the three campaigns in India  and Egypt had made his name known, and there was a general desire to  hear him and to see him. In one who had attacked Kitchener of Khartum,  the men of Oldham expected to find a stalwart veteran, bearded, and with  a voice of command. When they were introduced to a small red-haired boy  with a lisp, they refused to take him seriously. In England youth is an  unpardonable thing. Lately, Curzon, Churchill, Edward Grey, Hugh Cecil,  and others have made it less reprehensible. But, in spite of a vigorous  campaign, in which Lady Randolph took an active part, Oldham decided  it was not ready to accept young Churchill for a member. Later he was  Oldham's only claim to fame.    A week after he was defeated he sailed for South Africa, where war with  the Boers was imminent. He had resigned from his regiment and went south  as war correspondent for the _Morning Post_.    Later in the war he held a commission as Lieutenant in the South African  Light Horse, a regiment of irregular cavalry, and on the staffs  of different generals acted as galloper and aide-de-camp. To this  combination of duties, which was in direct violation of a rule of the  War Office, his brother officers and his fellow correspondents objected;  but, as in each of his other campaigns he had played this dual role, the  press censors considered it a traditional privilege, and winked at it.  As a matter of record, Churchill's soldiering never seemed to interfere  with his writing, nor, in a fight, did his duty to his paper ever  prevent him from mixing in as a belligerent.    War was declared October 9th, and only a month later, while scouting in  the armored train along the railroad line between Pietermaritzburg and  Colenso, the cars were derailed and Churchill was taken prisoner.    The train was made up of three flat cars, two armored cars, and between  them the engine, with three cars coupled to the cow-catcher and two to  the tender.    On the outward trip the Boers did not show themselves, but as soon as  the English passed Frere station they rolled a rock on the track at a  point where it was hidden by a curve. On the return trip, as the English  approached this curve the Boers opened fire with artillery and pompoms.  The engineer, in his eagerness to escape, rounded the curve at full  speed, and, as the Boers had expected, hit the rock. The three forward  cars were derailed, and one of them was thrown across the track, thus  preventing the escape of the engine and the two rear cars. From these  Captain Haldane, who was in command, with a detachment of the Dublins,  kept up a steady fire on the enemy, while Churchill worked to clear the  track. To assist him he had a company of Natal volunteers, and those who  had not run away of the train hands and break-down crew.    \"We were not long left in the comparative safety of a railroad  accident,\" Churchill writes to his paper. \"The Boers' guns, swiftly  changing their position, reopened fire from a distance of thirteen  hundred yards before any one had got out of the stage of exclamations.  The tapping rifle-fire spread along the hills, until it encircled the  wreckage on three sides, and from some high ground on the opposite side  of the line a third field-gun came into action.\"    For Boer marksmen with Mausers and pompoms, a wrecked railroad train  at thirteen hundred yards was as easy a bull's-eye as the hands of the  first baseman to the pitcher, and while the engine butted and snorted  and the men with their bare bands tore at the massive beams of the  freight-car, the bullets and shells beat about them.    \"I have had in the last four years many strange and varied experiences,\"  continues young Churchill, \"but nothing was so thrilling as this; to  wait and struggle among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the  repeated explosions of the shells, the noise of the projectiles striking  the cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing  of the engine--poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen  shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an  end of all--the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the  realization of powerlessness--all this for seventy minutes by the clock,  with only four inches of twisted iron between danger, captivity, and  shame on one side--and freedom on the other.\"    The \"protected\" train had proved a deathtrap, and by the time the line  was clear every fourth man was killed or wounded. Only the engine,  with the more severely wounded heaped in the cab and clinging to its  cow-catcher and foot-rails, made good its escape. Among those left  behind, a Tommy, without authority, raised a handkerchief on his rifle,  and the Boers instantly ceased firing and came galloping forward to  accept surrender. There was a general stampede to escape. Seeing that  Lieutenant Franklin was gallantly trying to hold his men, Churchill,  who was safe on the engine, jumped from it and ran to his assistance. Of  what followed, this is his own account:    \"Scarcely had the locomotive left me than I found myself alone in a  shallow cutting, and none of our soldiers, who had all surrendered,  to be seen. Then suddenly there appeared on the line at the end of the  cutting two men not in uniform. 'Plate-layers,' I said to myself, and  then, with a surge of realization, 'Boers.' My mind retains a momentary  impression of these tall figures, full of animated movement, clad in  dark flapping clothes, with slouch, storm-driven hats, posing their  rifles hardly a hundred yards away. I turned and ran between the  rails of the track, and the only thought I achieved was this: 'Boer  marksmanship.'    \"Two bullets passed, both within a foot, one on either side. I flung  myself against the banks of the cutting. But they gave no cover. Another  glance at the figures; one was now kneeling to aim. Again I darted  forward. Again two soft kisses sucked in the air, but nothing struck me.  I must get out of the cutting--that damnable corridor. I scrambled up  the bank. The earth sprang up beside me, and a bullet touched my hand,  but outside the cutting was a tiny depression. I crouched in this,  struggling to get my wind. On the other side of the railway a horseman  galloped up, shouting to me and waving his hand. He was scarcely forty  yards off. With a rifle I could have killed him easily. I knew nothing  of the white flag, and the bullets had made me savage. I reached down  for my Mauser pistol. I had left it in the cab of the engine. Between me  and the horseman there was a wire fence. Should I continue to fly?  The idea of another shot at such a short range decided me. Death stood  before me, grim and sullen; Death without his light-hearted companion,  Chance. So I held up my hand, and like Mr. Jorrock's foxes, cried  'Capivy!' Then I was herded with the other prisoners in a miserable  group, and about the same time I noticed that my hand was bleeding, and  it began to pour with rain.    \"Two days before I had written to an officer at home: 'There has been a  great deal too much surrendering in this war, and I hope people who do  so will not be encouraged.'\"    With other officers, Churchill was imprisoned in the State Model  Schools, situated in the heart of Pretoria. It was distinctly  characteristic that on the very day of his arrival he began to plan to  escape.    Toward this end his first step was to lose his campaign hat, which he  recognized was too obviously the hat of an English"]]]
