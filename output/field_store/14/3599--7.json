The inclination  remained to all appearances the same until sunset, when the observation  was concluded.    'In the second place, the distance between the centres of Venus and the  Sun I found by three observations to be as follows:--              The Hour.          | Distance of the Centres.                               |  At 3.15 by the clock         |        14' 24''   \" 3.35      \"               |        13' 30''   \" 3.45      \"               |        13'  0''   \" 3.50 the apparent sunset. |    The true setting being 3.45, and the apparent about 5 minutes later, the  difference being caused by refraction. The clock therefore was  sufficiently correct.    'In the third place I found after careful and repeated observation that  the diameter of Venus, as her shadow was depicted on the paper, was  larger indeed than the thirtieth part of the solar diameter, though not  more so than the sixth, or at the utmost the fifth of such a part.  Therefore let the diameter of the Sun be to the diameter of Venus as 30'  to 1' 12''. Certainly her diameter never equalled 1' 30'', scarcely  perhaps 1' 20'', and this was evident as well when the planet was near  the Sun's limb as when far distant from it.    [Illustration: VENUS ON THE SUN'S DISC.]    'This observation was made in an obscure village where I have long been  in the habit of observing, about fifteen miles to the north of  Liverpool, the latitude of which I believe to be 53 deg. 20', although by  common maps it is stated at 54 deg. 12', therefore the latitude of the  village will be 53 deg. 35', and longitude of both 22 deg. 30' from the  Fortunate Islands, now called the Canaries. This is 14 deg. 15' to the west  of Uraniburg in Denmark, the longitude of which is stated by Brahe, a  native of the place, to be 36 deg. 45' from these islands.    'This is all I could observe respecting this celebrated conjunction  during the short time the Sun remained in the horizon: for although  Venus continued on his disc for several hours, she was not visible to me  longer than half an hour on account of his so quickly setting.  Nevertheless, all the observations which could possibly be made in so  short a time I was enabled by Divine Providence to complete so  effectually that I could scarcely have wished for a more extended  period. The inclination was the only point upon which I failed to attain  the utmost precision; for, owing to the rapid motion of the Sun it was  difficult to observe with certainty to a single degree, and I frankly  confess that I neither did nor could ascertain it. But all the rest is  sufficiently accurate, and as exact as I could desire.'    Besides having ascertained that the diameter of Venus subtends an angle  not much greater than one minute of arc, Horrox reduced the horizontal  solar parallax from fifty-seven seconds as stated by Kepler to fourteen  seconds, a calculation within one and a half second of the value  assigned to it by Halley sixty years after. He also reduced the Sun's  semi-diameter.    Crabtree, to whom Horrox refers as 'his most esteemed friend and a  person who has few superiors in mathematical learning,' made  preparations to observe the transit similar to those already described.  But the day was unfavourable, dark clouds obscured the sky and rendered  the Sun invisible. Crabtree was in despair, and relinquished all hope of  being able to witness the conjunction. However, just before sunset there  was a break in the clouds, and the Sun shone brilliantly for a short  interval. Crabtree at once seized his opportunity, and to his intense  delight observed the planet fully entered upon the Sun's disc. Instead  of proceeding to take observations, he was so overcome with emotion at  the sight of the phenomenon, that he continued to gaze upon it with rapt  attention, nor did he recover his self-possession until the clouds again  hid from his view the setting Sun.[4]    Crabtree's observation of the transit was, however, not a fruitless one.  He drew from memory a diagram showing the exact position of Venus on the  Sun's disc, which corresponded in every respect with Horrox's  observation; he also estimated the diameter of the planet to be 7/200  that of the Sun, which when calculated gives one minute three seconds;  Horrox having found it to be one minute twelve seconds. This transit of  Venus is remarkable as having been the first ever observed of which  there is any record, and for this we are indebted to the genius of  Horrox, who by a series of calculations, displaying a wonderfully  accurate knowledge of mathematics, was enabled to predict the occurrence  of the phenomenon on the very day, and almost at the hour it appeared,  and of which he and his friend Crabtree were the only observers.    Having thought it desirable to write an account of the transit, Horrox  prepared an elegant Latin treatise, entitled 'Venus in Sole  Visa'--'Venus seen in the Sun;' but not knowing what steps to take with  regard to its publication, he requested Crabtree to communicate with his  bookseller and obtain his advice on the matter.    In the meantime Horrox returned to Toxteth, and arranged to fulfil a  long-promised visit to Crabtree, which he looked forward to with much  pleasure, as it would afford him an opportunity of discussing with his  friend many matters of interest to both. This visit was frustrated in a  manner altogether unexpected. For we read that Horrox was seized with a  sudden and severe illness, the nature of which is not known, and that  his death occurred on the day previous to that of his intended visit to  his friend at Broughton. He expired on January 3, 1641, when in the 23rd  year of his age.    His death was a great grief to Crabtree, who, in one of his letters,  describes it as 'an irreparable loss:' and it is believed that he only  survived him a few years.[5] Of the papers left by Horrox, only a few  have been preserved, and these were discovered in Crabtree's house after  his death. Among them was his treatise on the transit of Venus which,  with other papers, was purchased by Dr. Worthington, Fellow of Emmanuel  College, Cambridge, a man of learning, who was capable of appreciating  their value. Ultimately, the treatise fell into the possession of  Hevelius, a celebrated German astronomer, who published it along with a  dissertation of his own, describing a transit of Mercury.    Horrox did not live to see any of his writings published, nor was any  monument erected to his memory until nearly two hundred years after his  death. But his name, though long forgotten except by astronomers, is now  engraved on marble in Westminster Abbey. Had his life been spared, it  would have been difficult to foretell to what eminence and fame he might  have risen, or what further discoveries his genius might have enabled  him to make. Few among English astronomers will hesitate to rank him  next with the illustrious Newton, and all will agree with Herschel, who  called him 'the pride and the boast of British Astronomy.'    WILLIAM GASCOIGNE was born in 1612, in the parish of Rothwell, in the  county of York, and afterwards resided at Middleton, near Leeds.    He was a man of an inventive turn of mind, and possessed good abilities,  which he devoted to improving the methods of telescopic observation.    At an early age he was occupied in observing celestial objects, making  researches in optics, and acquiring a proficient knowledge of astronomy.    Among his acquaintances were Crabtree and Horrox, with whom he carried  on a correspondence on matters appertaining to their favourite study.    The measurement of small angles was found at all times to be one of the  greatest difficulties which astronomers had to contend with. Tycho Brahe  was so misled by his measurements of the apparent diameters of the Sun  and Moon, that he concluded a total eclipse of the Sun was impossible.    Gascoigne overcame this difficulty by his invention of the micrometer.  This instrument, when applied to a telescope, was found to be of great  service in the correct measurement of minute angles and distances, and  was the means of greatly advancing the progress of practical astronomy  in the seventeenth century. A micrometer consists of a short tube,  across the opening of which are stretched two parallel wires; these  being intersected at right angles by a third. The wires are moved to or  from each other by delicately constructed screws, to which they are  attached. Each revolution, or part of a revolution, of a screw indicates  the distance by which the wires are moved.    This apparatus, when placed in the focus of a lens, gives very accurate  measurements of the diameters of celestial objects. It was successfully  used by Gascoigne in determining the apparent diameters of the Sun,  Moon, and several of the planets, and the mutual distances of the stars  which form the Pleiades.    Crabtree, after having paid Gascoigne a visit in 1639, describes in a  letter to Horrox the impression created on his mind by the micrometer.  He writes: 'The first thing Mr. Gascoigne showed me was a large  telescope, amplified and adorned with new inventions of his own, whereby  he can take the diameters of the Sun or Moon, or any small angle in the  heavens or upon the earth, most exactly through the glass to a second.'    The micrometer is now regarded as an indispensable appliance in the  observatory; the use of a spider web reticule instead of wire having  improved its efficiency. Gascoigne was one of the earliest astronomers  who recognised the value of the Keplerian telescope for observational  purposes, and Sherburn affirms that he was the first to construct an  instrument of this description"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#11)"],[1," FORMS OF AVOIDABLE DISEASE, THEIR  REMEDY AND PREVENTION.          CHAPTER X.    CREATIVE POWER.      It is a wonderful thought that God shares His divine endowments with  man; that He, being our Father, hath bestowed upon us the power to  manifest His characteristics. We are proud of these Godlike powers. We  talk of our Godlike reason, and it is divine. We know that God  reasons. We have evidence of it in the material world about us, and  when we use our reason we are \"thinking God's thoughts after Him.\"    God has the marvelous power of imagination, using that word in its  noblest sense. He has the power to conceive something in thought  before it actually exists. He must have seen all the glories of the  material universe, worlds upon worlds circling through space, moon and  stars, the beauty of forest and stream, of tinted flower and  iridescent insect wing before they were brought into being, and He had  the power to create them. Man has this wonderful gift of imagination.  The inventor sees the machine in his thought before he attempts to  build it. The poet has the germ of his poem in mind, even the rhythm  and rhyme, before he puts it on paper. To the imagination of the  artist the canvas glows with color before his brush has touched it.  The sculptor, looking at the rough block of marble, sees within it the  imprisoned shape of beauty which his genius shall liberate to delight  the world. The musician hears, singing through his brain, the  marvelous harmonies which, put upon paper, shall entrance all hearers.  Certainly this glorious gift of imagination is Godlike. But it would  be useless if it were not accompanied by creative power. The inventor  must be able to create as well as to imagine the engine. The poet, the  musician, the artist fails of deserving the name if he cannot embody  his thought in a form that others may recognize. He must not only  imagine, but create. In some degree every intelligent human being has  these powers. The housewife imagines her dinner before she prepares  it, and a well-cooked dinner, placed upon a well-appointed table with  care and taste, manifests something of the ability of the inventor and  the artist. The same may be said of her who designs and creates an  elegant costume, or arranges a room with taste and skill.    We appreciate the housewife's culinary creation; we admire the  tasteful creation of the dressmaker; we wonder at the glorious  creation of artist or musician; perhaps we even envy them. But food  and clothing pass away and are forgotten. Even the grand symphony, the  beautiful picture, the graceful statue, may pass into oblivion, and  man forget that they ever existed.    But humanity is endowed with creative powers that are not transient.  The brains builded by the individual are transmitted to his posterity  from generation to generation.    God's greatest power is that of conferring life, sentient life. We  might have imagined that that marvelous power he would have kept for  Himself alone, but He has not done so. We have also the power to  confer life. We can call into existence other human beings, and endow  them with the record of our own lives, giving to them our form, our  features, our measure of vitality, our tendencies, our habits; and  these human beings whom we have thus called into life will never die.  What diviner, more responsible gift could God have conferred upon us  than this? What more worthy of our devout study? In this reverent  attitude of mind let us study this gift of creative power, learning  what we may of its scope and purpose and the material organs through  which it works.    In your study of physiology in school you took up the organs of  individual life. You studied the framework of the body, its machinery,  its internal vital mechanism. You studied about digestion, nutrition,  respiration, elimination, and in this you learned nothing of physical  differences between individuals. All were considered as having the  same organs, used in the same way. Girls have the same number of  bones as boys, the same number of muscles, of vital organs. They  sleep, breathe, eat, digest, grow, according to the same plan. So far  there seems no reason why there should be any distinction of male and  female. But as we come to study what is called special physiology we  discover physical differences and reasons for their existence.    There are certain differences of form that are discernible at a  glance. Men are usually larger than women. They have heavier bones and  bigger muscles. They have broad shoulders and narrow hips, and have  hair upon the face. Women have smooth faces, more rounded outlines,  narrower shoulders and broader hips. In man the broadest part of the  body is at the shoulders, in woman at the hips. This is significant of  a great fact which will be manifest to you when you understand the  functions of each sex. Although each has the same general plan of  individual life, there are special functions which determine the trend  of their lives. The man's broad shoulders are indicative that he is to  bear the heavy burdens of life--struggles for material support--and  woman's broad hips indicate that she is to bear the heavier burden of  the race.    When we come fully to understand the deep significance of sex, we  shall find in it a wonderful revelation of possibilities of  development into a God-likeness that will stir our hearts to their  very depths.    Humanity so weak, so lacking in appreciation of his possibilities, so  groveling when he should soar, has been endowed with powers that give  him control over the destiny of the race. We may well exclaim, with  Young:        \"How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,      How complicate, how wonderful is man!      How passing wonder He who made him such!      Who centred in his make such strange extremes!      From diff'rent natures, marvelously mix'd!      Connection exquisite of distant worlds!      Distinguish'd link in being's endless chain!      Midway from nothing to the Deity!\"          CHAPTER XI.    BUILDING BRAINS.      When you were born you were, as all babies are, deaf, dumb, blind, and  helpless, but immediately the external world began to act upon you.  Then began the process of mind-building. You began to experience  sensations of heat and cold, of hunger, of pain. The eyes began at  once to recognize the light, the ears to become aware of sounds. After  a time, objects were made clear to your sight and certain sounds were  recognized. You learned your mother's face and voice, and, little by  little, became acquainted with all the objects in the world of home.  You began to use your limbs, and in this also you were at work  building your mind. We do not sufficiently realize that every aimless  movement of the baby has in reality a great purpose--that of creating  brainpower sufficient to enable the baby to control itself in all its  voluntary movements. We do not think that the fluttering hands and  little kicking feet are really building brains, but this is so. And  all of life's experiences have been building brain for you ever since.    Professor Elmer Gates tells us that only about ten per cent. of our  brains are cultivated, that there is a vast field of brain  possibilities lying undeveloped in each one of us, and that these  possibilities are to be developed through cultivation of the senses.  So while I have been talking to you of the care of your body, I have  been advocating that which will in reality develop mind.    We have learned that certain areas of brain govern certain movements  of body. For example, anatomists know not only where the general motor  area is located, but they can indicate the very spot where any special  motor-force is generated.    In the case of a mill girl who was subject to epilepsy and had pain in  her right thumb at each attack, it was decided to remove the part of  the brain which governed the motions of that thumb. This they could do  because they knew just where that motor-center lies, and yet they were  able to take out no more than that, for when the wound was healed she  had full use of all of her hand except the thumb.    We may know that by exercising a certain organ we are building up a  certain part of the brain. For example, the man who has cultivated his  hearing until he can hear sounds inaudible to ordinary men, has made  for himself more brain-cells in the hearing area. If he has cultivated  his sight assiduously, he has created more visual cells. If his touch  has been cultivated, his brain has received new touch  sensation-cells. And Professor Gates asserts that his mental ability  has been thereby increased. You will be interested in hearing of his  experiments with animals and what he has learned therefrom.    He says he has demonstrated that it is possible to give to an animal  or a human being more brains, and consequently a better use of the  mental faculties. During twelve months, for five or six hours a day,  he trained dogs to discriminate colors. He placed several hundred tin  pans, painted different tints, in the yard with the dogs. At one time  he put their food under pans of a certain tint. When they had learned  to go at once to these pans for their food, he changed the color.  Again he arranged it so that they would receive an electric shock if  they touched pans of any color save the particular one. They soon  learned to avoid all the pans except those of this tint. So, by many  different methods, he trained them to recognize shades and tints until  they could discriminate between seven shades of red and as many shades  of green, and in many ways they manifested more mental ability than  any untrained dog. While these dogs were being trained, another group  of dogs were being deprived of the use of sight by being kept in a  darkened room.    At the end of the year both groups of dogs were killed and their  brains dissected. He found that the dogs kept in the darkness had "]]]
