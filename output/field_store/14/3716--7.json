But when you write about Mariposa, or hear of it, if  you know the place, it's all so vivid and real that a thing like the  contrast between the excursion crowd in the morning and the scene at  night leaps into your mind and you must think of it.      But never mind about the accident,--let us turn back again to the  morning.    The boat was due to leave at seven. There was no doubt about the  hour,--not only seven, but seven sharp. The notice in the Newspacket  said: \"The boat will leave sharp at seven;\" and the advertising posters  on the telegraph poles on Missinaba Street that began \"Ho, for Indian's  Island!\" ended up with the words: \"Boat leaves at seven sharp.\" There  was a big notice on the wharf that said: \"Boat leaves sharp on time.\"    So at seven, right on the hour, the whistle blew loud and long, and then  at seven fifteen three short peremptory blasts, and at seven thirty one  quick angry call,--just one,--and very soon after that they cast off  the last of the ropes and the Mariposa Belle sailed off in her cloud of  flags, and the band of the Knights of Pythias, timing it to a nicety,  broke into the \"Maple Leaf for Ever!\"    I suppose that all excursions when they start are much the same. Anyway,  on the Mariposa Belle everybody went running up and down all over the  boat with deck chairs and camp stools and baskets, and found places,  splendid places to sit, and then got scared that there might be better  ones and chased off again. People hunted for places out of the sun and  when they got them swore that they weren't going to freeze to please  anybody; and the people in the sun said that they hadn't paid fifty  cents to be roasted. Others said that they hadn't paid fifty cents to  get covered with cinders, and there were still others who hadn't paid  fifty cents to get shaken to death with the propeller.    Still, it was all right presently. The people seemed to get sorted out  into the places on the boat where they belonged. The women, the older  ones, all gravitated into the cabin on the lower deck and by getting  round the table with needlework, and with all the windows shut, they  soon had it, as they said themselves, just like being at home.    All the young boys and the toughs and the men in the band got down on  the lower deck forward, where the boat was dirtiest and where the anchor  was and the coils of rope.    And upstairs on the after deck there were Lilian Drone and Miss Lawson,  the high school teacher, with a book of German poetry,--Gothey I think  it was,--and the bank teller and the younger men.    In the centre, standing beside the rail, were Dean Drone and Dr.  Gallagher, looking through binocular glasses at the shore.    Up in front on the little deck forward of the pilot house was a group  of the older men, Mullins and Duff and Mr. Smith in a deck chair, and  beside him Mr. Golgotha Gingham, the undertaker of Mariposa, on a stool.  It was part of Mr. Gingham's principles to take in an outing of this  sort, a business matter, more or less,--for you never know what may  happen at these water parties. At any rate, he was there in a neat suit  of black, not, of course, his heavier or professional suit, but a soft  clinging effect as of burnt paper that combined gaiety and decorum to a  nicety.      \"Yes,\" said Mr. Gingham, waving his black glove in a general way towards  the shore, \"I know the lake well, very well. I've been pretty much all  over it in my time.\"    \"Canoeing?\" asked somebody.    \"No,\" said Mr. Gingham, \"not in a canoe.\" There seemed a peculiar and  quiet meaning in his tone.    \"Sailing, I suppose,\" said somebody else.    \"No,\" said Mr. Gingham. \"I don't understand it.\"    \"I never knowed that you went on to the water at all, Gol,\" said Mr.  Smith, breaking in.    \"Ah, not now,\" explained Mr. Gingham; \"it was years ago, the first  summer I came to Mariposa. I was on the water practically all day.  Nothing like it to give a man an appetite and keep him in shape.\"    \"Was you camping?\" asked Mr. Smith.    \"We camped at night,\" assented the undertaker, \"but we put in  practically the whole day on the water. You see we were after a party  that had come up here from the city on his vacation and gone out in a  sailing canoe. We were dragging. We were up every morning at sunrise,  lit a fire on the beach and cooked breakfast, and then we'd light our  pipes and be off with the net for a whole day. It's a great life,\"  concluded Mr. Gingham wistfully.    \"Did you get him?\" asked two or three together.    There was a pause before Mr. Gingham answered.    \"We did,\" he said,--\"down in the reeds past Horseshoe Point. But it was  no use. He turned blue on me right away.\"    After which Mr. Gingham fell into such a deep reverie that the boat had  steamed another half mile down the lake before anybody broke the silence  again.    Talk of this sort,--and after all what more suitable for a day on the  water?--beguiled the way.      Down the lake, mile by mile over the calm water, steamed the Mariposa  Belle. They passed Poplar Point where the high sand-banks are with all  the swallows' nests in them, and Dean Drone and Dr. Gallagher looked at  them alternately through the binocular glasses, and it was wonderful how  plainly one could see the swallows and the banks and the shrubs,--just  as plainly as with the naked eye.    And a little further down they passed the Shingle Beach, and Dr.  Gallagher, who knew Canadian history, said to Dean Drone that it  was strange to think that Champlain had landed there with his French  explorers three hundred years ago; and Dean Drone, who didn't know  Canadian history, said it was stranger still to think that the hand of  the Almighty had piled up the hills and rocks long before that; and  Dr. Gallagher said it was wonderful how the French had found their way  through such a pathless wilderness; and Dean Drone said that it was  wonderful also to think that the Almighty had placed even the smallest  shrub in its appointed place. Dr. Gallagher said it filled him with  admiration. Dean Drone said it filled him with awe. Dr. Gallagher said  he'd been full of it ever since he was a boy; and Dean Drone said so had  he.    Then a little further, as the Mariposa Belle steamed on down the lake,  they passed the Old Indian Portage where the great grey rocks are; and  Dr. Gallagher drew Dean Drone's attention to the place where the narrow  canoe track wound up from the shore to the woods, and Dean Drone said he  could see it perfectly well without the glasses.    Dr. Gallagher said that it was just here that a party of five hundred  French had made their way with all their baggage and accoutrements  across the rocks of the divide and down to the Great Bay. And Dean Drone  said that it reminded him of Xenophon leading his ten thousand Greeks  over the hill passes of Armenia down to the sea. Dr. Gallagher said the  he had often wished he could have seen and spoken to Champlain, and Dean  Drone said how much he regretted to have never known Xenophon.    And then after that they fell to talking of relics and traces of the  past, and Dr. Gallagher said that if Dean Drone would come round to his  house some night he would show him some Indian arrow heads that he had  dug up in his garden. And Dean Drone said that if Dr. Gallagher would  come round to the rectory any afternoon he would show him a map of  Xerxes' invasion of Greece. Only he must come some time between the  Infant Class and the Mothers' Auxiliary.    So presently they both knew that they were blocked out of one another's  houses for some time to come, and Dr. Gallagher walked forward and told  Mr. Smith, who had never studied Greek, about Champlain crossing the  rock divide.    Mr. Smith turned his head and looked at the divide for half a second and  then said he had crossed a worse one up north back of the Wahnipitae  and that the flies were Hades,--and then went on playing freezeout poker  with the two juniors in Duff's bank.    So Dr. Gallagher realized that that's always the way when you try to  tell people things, and that as far as gratitude and appreciation goes  one might as well never read books or travel anywhere or do anything.    In fact, it was at this very moment that he made up his mind to give the  arrows to the Mariposa Mechanics' Institute,--they afterwards became, as  you know, the Gallagher Collection. But, for the time being, the doctor  was sick of them and wandered off round the boat and watched Henry  Mullins showing George Duff how to make a John Collins without lemons,  and finally went and sat down among the Mariposa band and wished that he  hadn't come.    So the boat steamed on and the sun rose higher and higher, and the  freshness of the morning changed into the full glare of noon, and they  went on to where the lake began to narrow in at its foot, just where  the Indian's Island is, all grass and trees and with a log wharf running  into the water: Below it the Lower Ossawippi runs out of the lake, and  quite near are the rapids, and you can see down among the trees the red  brick of the power house and hear the roar of the leaping water.    The Indian's Island itself is all covered with trees and tangled vines,  and the water about it is so still that it's all reflected double and  looks the same either way up. Then when the steamer's whistle blows as  it comes into the wharf, you hear it echo among the trees of the island,  and reverberate back from the shores of the lake.    The scene is all so quiet and still and unbroken, that Miss  Cleghorn,--the sallow girl in the telephone exchange, that I spoke  of--said she'd like to be buried there. But all the people were so busy  getting their baskets and gathering up their things that no one had time  to attend to it.    I mustn't even try to describe the landing and the boat crunching  against the wooden wharf and all the people running "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#11)"],[1," dog I'll whip you;' and then went on to show  the brethren how wicked and unchristian-like such conduct appeared  before the eyes of truth and justice.    \"On Friday, the 6th, we resumed our journey. On Saturday night we  camped among our brethren at Salt River, in the Allred settlement, in  a piece of woods by a beautiful spring of water, and prepared for the  Sabbath. On the Sabbath we had preaching. We remained here several  days, washing our clothes and preparing to resume our journey. Here we  were joined by Hyrum Smith and Lyman Wight, with another company. The  camp now numbered two hundred and five men, all armed and equipped. It  was delightful to see the company, for they were all young men, with  one or two exceptions, and all in good spirits.    \"We were now reorganized in the following order: Joseph Smith was  acknowledged commander-in-chief; Lyman Wight was chosen general of the  camp; then Brother Joseph chose twenty men for his life guard, I being  one of them; Brother George A. Smith was Brother Joseph's  armor-bearer; Hyrum Smith was chosen captain of the life guard; the  remainder of the camp was organized into companies as before stated.  We had twenty-five wagons, two horses on each, and on some three. One  day while we remained here our general marched us out on a large  prairie. He then proceeded to inspect us, examine our firelocks, etc.  Afterwards we were marched in platoons, and, an object being placed,  we discharged our pieces in order to try them. We were drilled about  half a day, and then returned to the camp.    \"My first attempt at washing my clothes took place at Salt River. My  shirts being extremely dirty, I put them into a kettle of water and  boiled them for about two hours, having observed that women who washed  boiled their clothes, and I supposed by so doing they boiled out the  dirt; I then took them and washed them, endeavoring to imitate a woman  washing as near as I could. I rubbed the clothes with my knuckles  instead of the palm of my hand, and rubbed the skin off so that my  hands were very sore for several days. My attempts were vain in trying  to get the dirt out of the clothes. I wondered at this considerably,  and scolded and fretted because I could not get the dirt out, and  finally gave it up, and wrung them and hung them out to dry. Having no  flat-irons to iron them, I took them to Sisters Hollbrook and Ripley  to get them ironed. When they saw them they said I had not washed my  clothes. I told them I had done my best, and although I had boiled  them two hours before washing, and had washed them so faithfully that  I had taken the skin off my knuckles, still I had not been successful  in getting the dirt out. They laughed heartily, and informed me that  by boiling before washing I had boiled the dirt into them.    \"On the 12th we again resumed our march; many of the inhabitants went  with us several miles; they seemed to have much respect for us. We  traveled about fourteen miles and camped on a large prairie.    \"We tarried in the middle of this prairie, which was about  twenty-eight miles across, on account of a rupture which took place in  the camp. Here F. G. Williams and Roger Orton received a very severe  chastisement from Brother Joseph for not obeying orders. In this place  further regulations were made in regard to the organization of the  camp.    \"A day or two after this, Bishop Partridge met us, direct from Clay  County, as we were camping on the bank of the Wacondah River, in the  woods. We received much information from Brother Partridge concerning  the hostile feelings and prejudices that existed against us in all  quarters of Missouri. It gave us great satisfaction to receive  intelligence from him, as we were in peril and threatened all the  time. I will here mention one circumstance that transpired during our  stay at this place, which was that of Brother Lyman Wight baptizing  Dean Gould, as he was not previously a member of the Church, yet had  accompanied us all the way from Kirtland.    \"We pursued our journey, following the bank of the river, for several  miles. As we left the river and came into a very beautiful prairie,  Brother William Smith killed a very large deer, which made us some  very nourishing soup, and added to our comfort considerably.    \"On Wednesday, the 18th, at night, we camped one mile from the town of  Richmond, Ray County. On Thursday, the 19th, we arose as soon as it  was light and passed through the town before the inhabitants were up.  As Luke Johnson and others were passing through before the teams came  along, Brother Luke observed a black woman in a gentleman's garden  near the road. She beckoned to him and said, 'come here massa.' She  was evidently much agitated in her feelings. He went up to the fence  and she said to him, 'there is a company of men lying in wait here who  are calculating to kill you this morning as you pass through.' This  was nothing new to us as we had been continually threatened through  the whole journey, and death and destruction seemed to await us daily.  This day we only traveled about fifteen miles. One wagon broke down  and the wheels ran off from another, and there seemed to be many  things to hinder our progress, although we strove with all diligence  to speed our way forward. Our intentions were when we started to go  through to Clay County that day; but all in vain.    \"This night we camped on an elevated piece of land between two  branches of the Fishing River. Just as we halted and were making  preparations for the night, five men rode into the camp and told us we  should see hell before morning, and such horrible oaths as came from  their lips I never heard before. They told us that sixty men were  coming from Richmond, who had sworn to destroy us, also seventy more  were coming from Clay County, to assist in our destruction. These men  were black with passion, and armed with guns, and the whole country  was in a rage against us, and nothing but the power of God could save  us. All this time the weather was pleasant. Soon after these men left  us we discovered a small black cloud rising in the west, and not more  than twenty minutes passed away before it began to rain and hail; but  we had very little hail in our camp. All around us the hail was heavy;  some of the hailstones, or rather lumps of ice, were as large as hens'  eggs. The thunder rolled with awful majesty, and the red lightnings  flashed through the horizon, making it so light that I could see to  pick up a pin almost any time through the night. The earth quaked and  trembled, and there being no cessation it seemed as though the  Almighty had issued forth his mandate of vengeance. The wind was so  terrible that many of our tents were blown down. We were not able to  hold them up; but there being an old meeting house close at hand, many  of us fled there to secure ourselves from the storm. Many trees were  blown down, and others were twisted and wrung like a withe. The mob  came to the river two miles from us, but the river had risen to that  height that they were obliged to stop without crossing over. The hail  fell so heavily upon them that it beat holes in their hats, and in  some instances even broke the stocks off their guns; their horses,  being frightened, fled, leaving the riders on the ground. Their powder  was wet, and it was evident that the Almighty fought in our defense.  This night the river raised forty feet.    \"In the morning I went to the river in company with Brother Joseph  Smith, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young and others, as we had it in  contemplation to proceed that morning to Liberty, Clay County; but we  could not continue our journey as there was no way to cross the river.  It was then overflowing its banks; and I have seen the river since and  proved that it was fully forty feet from the top of its banks to the  bottom. Previous to this rain falling, it was no more than ankle deep.  Such a time never was known by us before; still we felt calm all  night, and the Lord was with us. The water was ankle deep to us all  night, even on that eminence, so we could not sleep.    \"At this place W. W. Phelps, S. W. Denton, John Corrill and many  others from Liberty joined us; from whom we received much information  from the brethren who had been driven from Jackson County, and learned  of the fixed determination of our enemies to drive or exterminate them  from that county.    \"The next day, when we moved into the country we saw that the hail had  destroyed the crops, and we saw that it had come in some directions  within a mile and in other directions within a half mile of our camp.  After passing a short distance the ground was literally covered with  branches of the trees which had been cut off by the hail. We went a  distance of five miles on the prairie to get food for our horses and  also to get some provisions for ourselves, and to get into some secure  place where we could defend ourselves from the rage of the enemy. We  stayed there three or four days, until the rage of the people was  somewhat allayed.    \"On the 21st Colonel Sconce and two other leading men from Ray County  came to see us, desiring to know what our intentions were, 'for,' said  he, 'I see that there is an almighty power that protects this people,  for I started from Richmond, Ray County, with a company of armed men,  having a fixed determination to destroy you, but was kept back by the  storm and was not able to reach you.' When he came into camp he was  seized with such a trembling that he was obliged to sit down in order  to compose himself. When he desired to know what our intentions were,  Brother Joseph arose and began to speak; and the power of God rested  upon him. He gave a relation of the sufferings of our people in  Jackson County, and also many of our persecutions and what we had  suffered from our enemies for our religion; and that we had come one  thousand miles to assist our brethren, to bring them"]]]
