What would  Horatius have done if somebody had nipped him by the ear when he  was holding the bridge? The story does not consider the  possibility. Yet it might have made all the difference. Did the  gentleman state his business?\"    \"Nope. Just tried to butt t'roo.\"    \"Another of these strong silent men. The world is full of us. These  are the perils of the journalistic life. You will be safer and  happier when you are rounding up cows on your mustang.\"    \"I wonder what he wanted,\" said Billy, when they were back again in  the inner room.    \"Who can say, Comrade Windsor? Possibly our autographs. Possibly  five minutes' chat on general subjects.\"    \"I don't like the look of him,\" said Billy.    \"Whereas what Comrade Maloney objected to was the feel of him. In  what respect did his look jar upon you? His clothes were poorly  cut, but such things, I know, leave you unmoved.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said Billy thoughtfully, \"as if he came just to  get a sight of us.\"    \"And he got it. Ah, Providence is good to the poor.\"    \"Whoever's behind those tenements isn't going to stick at any odd  trifle. We must watch out. That man was probably sent to mark us  down for one of the gangs. Now they'll know what we look like, and  they can get after us.\"    \"These are the drawbacks to being public men, Comrade Windsor. We  must bear them manfully, without wincing.\"    Billy turned again to his work.    \"I'm not going to wince,\" he said, \"so's you could notice it with a  microscope. What I'm going to do is to buy a good big stick. And  I'd advise you to do the same.\"                *    *    *    It was by Psmith's suggestion that the editorial staff of _Cosy  Moments_ dined that night in the roof-garden at the top of the  Astor Hotel.    \"The tired brain,\" he said, \"needs to recuperate. To feed on such  a night as this in some low-down hostelry on the level of the  street, with German waiters breathing heavily down the back of  one's neck and two fiddles and a piano whacking out 'Beautiful  Eyes' about three feet from one's tympanum, would be false economy.  Here, fanned by cool breezes and surrounded by fair women and brave  men, one may do a bit of tissue-restoring. Moreover, there is  little danger up here of being slugged by our moth-eaten  acquaintance of this morning. A man with trousers like his would  not be allowed in. We shall probably find him waiting for us at the  main entrance with a sand-bag, when we leave, but, till then--\"    He turned with gentle grace to his soup.    It was a warm night, and the roof-garden was full. From where they  sat they could see the million twinkling lights of the city.  Towards the end of the meal, Psmith's gaze concentrated itself on  the advertisement of a certain brand of ginger-ale in Times Square.  It is a mass of electric light arranged in the shape of a great  bottle, and at regular intervals there proceed from the bottle's  mouth flashes of flame representing ginger-ale. The thing began to  exercise a hypnotic effect on Psmith. He came to himself with a  start, to find Billy Windsor in conversation with a waiter.    \"Yes, my name's Windsor,\" Billy was saying.    The waiter bowed and retired to one of the tables where a young man  in evening clothes was seated. Psmith recollected having seen this  solitary diner looking in their direction once or twice during  dinner, but the fact had not impressed him.    \"What is happening, Comrade Windsor?\" he inquired. \"I was musing  with a certain tenseness at the moment, and the rush of events has  left me behind.\"    \"Man at that table wanted to know if my name was Windsor,\" said  Billy.    \"Ah?\" said Psmith, interested; \"and was it?\"    \"Here he comes. I wonder what he wants. I don't know the man from  Adam.\"    The stranger was threading his way between the tables.    \"Can I have a word with you, Mr. Windsor?\" he said.    Billy looked at him curiously. Recent events had made him wary of  strangers.    \"Won't you sit down?\" he said.    A waiter was bringing a chair. The young man seated himself.    \"By the way,\" added Billy; \"my friend, Mr. Smith.\"    \"Pleased to meet you,\" said the other.    \"I don't know your name,\" Billy hesitated.    \"Never mind about my name,\" said the stranger. \"It won't be  needed. Is Mr. Smith on your paper? Excuse my asking.\"    Psmith bowed. \"That's all right, then. I can go ahead.\" He bent  forward.    \"Neither of you gentlemen are hard of hearing, eh?\"    \"In the old prairie days,\" said Psmith, \"Comrade Windsor was known  to the Indians as Boola-Ba-Na-Gosh, which, as you doubtless know,  signifies Big-Chief-Who-Can-Hear-A-Fly-Clear-Its-Throat. I too can  hear as well as the next man. Why?\"    \"That's all right, then. I don't want to have to shout it. There's  some things it's better not to yell.\"    He turned to Billy, who had been looking at him all the while with  a combination of interest and suspicion. The man might or might not  be friendly. In the meantime, there was no harm in being on one's  guard. Billy's experience as a cub-reporter had given him the  knowledge that is only given in its entirety to police and  newspaper men: that there are two New Yorks. One is a modern,  well-policed city, through which one may walk from end to end  without encountering adventure. The other is a city as full of  sinister intrigue, of whisperings and conspiracies, of battle,  murder, and sudden death in dark by-ways, as any town of mediaeval  Italy. Given certain conditions, anything may happen to any one in  New York. And Billy realised that these conditions now prevailed in  his own case. He had come into conflict with New York's  underworld. Circumstances had placed him below the surface, where  only his wits could help him.    \"It's about that tenement business,\" said the stranger.    Billy bristled. \"Well, what about it?\" he demanded truculently.    The stranger raised a long and curiously delicately shaped hand.  \"Don't bite at me,\" he said. \"This isn't my funeral. I've no kick  coming. I'm a friend.\"    \"Yet you don't tell us your name.\"    \"Never mind my name. If you were in my line of business, you  wouldn't be so durned stuck on this name thing. Call me Smith, if  you like.\"    \"You could select no nobler pseudonym,\" said Psmith cordially.    \"Eh? Oh, I see. Well, make it Brown, then. Anything you please. It  don't signify. See here, let's get back. About this tenement thing.  You understand certain parties have got it in against you?\"    \"A charming conversationalist, one Comrade Parker, hinted at  something of the sort,\" said Psmith, \"in a recent interview. _Cosy  Moments_, however, cannot be muzzled.\"    \"Well?\" said Billy.    \"You're up against a big proposition.\"    \"We can look after ourselves.\"    \"Gum! you'll need to. The man behind is a big bug.\"    Billy leaned forward eagerly.    \"Who is he?\"    The other shrugged his shoulders.    \"I don't know. You wouldn't expect a man like that to give himself  away.\"    \"Then how do you know he's a big bug?\"    \"Precisely,\" said Psmith. \"On what system have you estimated the  size of the gentleman's bughood?\"    The stranger lit a cigar.    \"By the number of dollars he was ready to put up to have you done  in.\"    Billy's eyes snapped.    \"Oh?\" he said. \"And which gang has he given the job to?\"    \"I wish I could tell you. He--his agent, that is--came to Bat  Jarvis.\"    \"The cat-expert?\" said Psmith. \"A man of singularly winsome  personality.\"    \"Bat turned the job down.\"    \"Why was that?\" inquired Billy.    \"He said he needed the money as much as the next man, but when he  found out who he was supposed to lay for, he gave his job the  frozen face. Said you were a friend of his and none of his fellows  were going to put a finger on you. I don't know what you've been  doing to Bat, but he's certainly Willie the Long-Lost Brother with  you.\"    \"A powerful argument in favour of kindness to animals!\" said  Psmith. \"Comrade Windsor came into possession of one of Comrade  Jarvis's celebrated stud of cats. What did he do? Instead of having  the animal made into a nourishing soup, he restored it to its  bereaved owner. Observe the sequel. He is now as a prize  tortoiseshell to Comrade Jarvis.\"    \"So Bat wouldn't stand for it?\" said Billy.    \"Not on his life. Turned it down without a blink. And he sent me  along to find you and tell you so.\"    \"We are much obliged to Comrade Jarvis,\" said Psmith.    \"He told me to tell you to watch out, because another gang is dead  sure to take on the job. But he said you were to know he wasn't  mixed up in it. He also said that any time you were in bad, he'd  do his best for you. You've certainly made the biggest kind of hit  with Bat. I haven't seen him so worked up over a thing in years.  Well, that's all, I reckon. Guess I'll be pushing along. I've a  date to keep. Glad to have met you. Glad to have met you, Mr.  Smith. Pardon me, you have an insect on your coat.\"    He flicked at Psmith's coat with a quick movement. Psmith thanked  him gravely.    \"Good night,\" concluded the stranger, moving off. For a few  moments after he had gone, Psmith and Billy sat smoking in silence.  They had plenty to think about.    \"How's the time going?\" asked Billy at length. Psmith felt for his  watch, and looked at Billy with some sadness.    \"I am sorry to say, Comrade Windsor--\"    \"Hullo,\" said Billy, \"here's that man coming back again.\"    The stranger came up to their table, wearing a light overcoat over  his dress clothes. From the pocket of this he produced a gold  watch.    \"Force of habit,\" he said apologetically, handing it to Psmith.  \"You'll pardon me. Good night, gentlemen, again.\"          CHAPTER XII    A RED TAXIMETER    The Astor Hotel faces on to Times Square.

Nevertheless, the date (July 6) on which No. 32750  was obtained suggests that this flycatcher may breed in southeastern  Coahuila.    *_Empidonax difficilis hellmayri_ Brodkorb.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31469, from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May  13, 1954, measurements: wing, 71 mm.; tail, 65 mm.; culmen, 11.5 mm.;  tarsus, 17.0 mm.    Miller (1955a:167) reported that the Western Flycatcher breeds in the  Sierra del Carmen, from 6800 to 7500 feet. According to Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:91), this subspecies has been  recorded from Sierra Guadalupe. No. 31469 closely resembles, especially  in measurements, the specimens of the Western Flycatcher from the  Chisos Mountains of Texas as reported by Brodkorb (1935:2).    _Empidonax difficilis_ subsp.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) obtained  a specimen of _E. difficilis_ \"near the summit of Diamante Pass\" that  they tentatively identified as _E. d. salvini_. However, they  considered the specimen as possibly _E. d. immemoratus_ or _E. d.  occidentalis_.    Localities listed by Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:92) of  _E. d. salvini_ and _E. d. immemoratus_ are south of twenty-three  degrees north latitude whereas the range of _E. d. occidentalis_  includes parts of Nuevo Leon north of twenty-three degrees north  latitude (_occidentalis_ intergrades with _hellmayri_ at Cerro Potosi,  Nuevo Leon, [Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, _loc. cit._]).  Thus, the specimen from Diamante Pass probably is either _E. d.  hellmayri_ or _E. d. occidentalis_.    **_Empidonax fulvifrons pygmaeus_ Coues.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:95) listed this subspecies of the Buff-breasted  Flycatcher from the Sierra Guadalupe on April 21. This record  represents the eastern limit of the range of _E. f. pygmaeus_ in  northeastern Mexico.    **_Contopus pertinax pertinax_ Cabanis and Heine.--Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:194) obtained one female Coues' Flycatcher \"in a small gully just  below the summit of Diamante Pass.\"    _Contopus virens_ (Linnaeus).--I judge from the paucity of records in  the literature that the Eastern Wood Pewee is uncommon in Coahuila.  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) obtained two males at the Chorro del  Agua, and remarked also that \"it is possible that as far west as  Saltillo, this species is a rather uncommon transient.\" Ridgway  (1907:519) listed _Contopus virens_ from Sabinas.    *_Contopus sordidulus veliei_ Coues.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Male] 31467 from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May  14, 1954; and [Male] 31653 from the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe (=10  mi. S, 5 mi. W General Cepeda), 6400 ft., April 19, 1953.    Specimen No. 31467 of the Western Wood Pewee was obtained in pine and  oak vegetation by Dickerman. Ridgway (1907:523) reported _Contopus  sordidulus veliei_, under the name _Myiochanes richardsonii  richardsonii_, from Sierra Encarnacion. Amadon and Phillips (1947:578)  obtained a specimen of _C. sordidulus_ from Las Delicias. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:83) remarked that the Western Wood  Pewee breeds in the State.    _Nuttallornis borealis_ (Swainson).--Several records of the Olive-sided  Flycatcher from Coahuila are present in the literature. Miller  (1955a:167) reported it as a migrant in the desert at the base of the  Sierra del Carmen on April 24. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:82) reported this species from Ocampo on June 16. Amadon and  Phillips (1947:578) obtained one at Las Delicias on August 16. Burleigh  and Lowery (1942:194) collected two males \"near the summit of Diamante  Pass\" on April 14.    *_Pyrocephalus rubinus mexicanus_ Sclater.--_Specimens examined:_ total  3: [Male] 32060 and [Female] 32061 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850  ft., June 19, 1952; and sex ? 32062 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June  20, 1952.    The Vermilion Flycatcher is common in Coahuila. Except in the  northwestern part of the State, the subspecies _mexicanus_ is present  throughout Coahuila. The size of No. 32060 (wing, 80 mm.; tail, 62 mm.)  suggests that the specimen is an intergrade between _P. r. flammeus_  and _mexicanus_. _P. r. flammeus_ and _mexicanus_ seem to intergrade in  northern Coahuila.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:195) found _mexicanus_ to be \"quite plentiful  on the plains surrounding Saltillo.\" Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:33)  noted the Vermilion Flycatcher \"near San Pedro.\" Cory and Hellmayr  (1927:92) listed _P. r. mexicanus_ from Sabinas. The size of the testes  (6x4 mm. long) of No. 32060 and the dates (June 19 and 20) on which our  specimens were collected indicate breeding.    _Pyrocephalus rubinus flammeus_ van Rossem.--This subspecies of  Vermilion Flycatcher occupies the northwestern section of Coahuila.  Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287) took a specimen of _P. r. flammeus_  \"near Santo Domingo, east of the Del Carmens....\" Miller (1955a:167)  re-examined this specimen and stated that \"its affinity with the  northwest race of the species seems correct in terms of the characters  outlined by van Rossem (1934:353).\"    _Eremophila alpestris enthymia_ (Oberholser).--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:105) recorded this subspecies of Horned Lark  wintering 4 mi. S Hipolito (November 2 to February 24). They reported  also that _E. a. enthymia_ breeds in Coahuila (4 mi. S Hipolito ?).    *_Eremophila alpestris diaphora_ (Oberholser).--_Specimens examined:_  total 9: [Male] [Male] 32073-32078 and [Female] 32079 from 7 mi. S, 4  mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June 25, 1952; and [Male] [Male]  31605-31606 from 14 mi. W San Antonio de las Alazanas, 6500 ft.,  January 9, 1954.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:195) wrote that this subspecies of Horned  Lark was uncommon \"about Saltillo,\" but \"fairly common\" in Diamante  Valley, at about 7000 feet. Oberholser (1902:863) recorded the  subspecies _aphrasta_ from La Ventura. Ridgway (1907:326) listed  _Otocoris alpestris aphrasta_ Oberholser from Saltillo and La Ventura.  However, Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:105) indicated  that _E. a. diaphora_ rather than _aphrasta_ was recorded from Saltillo  and La Ventura. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:35) remarked that \"specimens  collected near Ramos Arizpe [in southeastern Coahuila]\" proved to be  _E. a. aphrasta_. However, this record might be questioned, as Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (_op. cit._) indicated, because  _diaphora_, rather than _aphrasta_, seems to occupy the southeastern  sector of Coahuila. Possibly typical representatives of _aphrasta_  and/or intergrades between _aphrasta_ and _diaphora_ are present in  western Coahuila; however, no records of _E. a. aphrasta_ exist from  western Coahuila.    The sizes of Nos. 32073-32077 and 31605-31606 (wing, 98.0-101.5 mm.,  averaging 99.7 mm.), the bright yellow throat, and the vinaceous color  of the hindneck characterize clearly the subspecies _diaphora_. The  sizes of the testes (9x6 mm.; 8x5 mm.; 10x6 mm.; 8x4 mm.; 11x6 mm.) of  Nos. 32073-32077, the size of the largest ovum (6.5 mm.) of No. 32079,  and the juvenile (32078) are evidence of breeding of _E. a. diaphora_  in Coahuila.    *_Tachycineta thalassina thalassina_ (Swainson).--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: [Male] 31471, [Male] 31473, and [Female] 31472 from Sierra del  Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May 15, 1954, measurements: wings,  125, 118, 108 mm.; tails, 56, 54, 46 mm.    The two subspecies of the Violet-green Swallow, _thalassina_ and  _lepida_, intergrade in Coahuila. Specimens from different localities  in the State represent various stages of intergradation between the two  subspecies; generally those from northern Coahuila seem to be closer to  _T. t. lepida_, and those from southern Coahuila are closer to _T. t.  thalassina_. Nos. 31471-31473 are intergrades between _T. t.  thalassina_ and _T. t. lepida_; in size the three resemble _T. t.  thalassina_, but in green, rather than purple, backs and scapulars  resemble _T. t. lepida_. The rumps of Nos. 31471-31473 show some purple  with the green, but are nearer _thalassina_ in this character.    Gonadal sizes (testes 10x7, 10x8 mm., one ovum 6 mm.) indicate that the  Violet-green Swallow breeds in the Sierra del Pino.    *_Tachycineta thalassina lepida_ Mearns.--Miller (1955a:167) reported  that Violet-green Swallows taken in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del  Carmen are intermediate between _T. t. lepida_ and _thalassina_;  however, he referred his sample to _lepida_ on the basis of short wing.    _Iridoprocne bicolor_ (Vieillot).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:114) reported the Tree Swallow from Hipolito on February  22.    _Stelgidopteryx ruficollis psammochrous_ Griscom.--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:111) reported this subspecies of the  Rough-winged Swallow from Saltillo.    *_Hirundo rustica erythrogaster_ Boddaert.--Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:195) stated that the Barn Swallow was the most abundant swallow  \"about Saltillo.\" Because these swallows occupied houses about Saltillo  and neighboring villages, Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) concluded  that the species nests commonly in the Saltillo area. Findley saw Barn  Swallows 2 mi. S and 11 mi. E Nava, 810 feet, on June 15, 1952.  Dickerman observed them at San Marcos (=20 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas) on  May 4, 1954.    *_Petrochelidon pyrrhonota minima_ van Rossem and  Hachisuka.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2: [Male] [Male] 31585-31586  from 14 mi. W San Antonio de las Alazanas, April 9, 1954.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:196) noted the Cliff Swallow \"in small  numbers about Saltillo and the nearby villages\" where the species  \"showed evidence of beginning to nest in many of the houses....\" They  (_loc. cit._) found Cliff Swallows also at the Chorro del Agua and  Diamante Valley. According to Dickerman, Nos. 31585-31586 were from a  colony, members of which were"]]]
