[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#11)"],[1,"the sea like sequins shaking, and the  sky far, far, far above, unfathomably clear. How glad to be on a ship!  What a golden hour for the heart of man! Ah if one could sail for ever,  on a small quiet, lonely ship, from land to land and isle to isle, and  saunter through the spaces of this lovely world, always through the  spaces of this lovely world. Sweet it would be sometimes to come to the  opaque earth, to block oneself against the stiff land, to annul the  vibration of one's flight against the inertia of our _terra firma!_ but  life itself would be in the flight, the tremble of space. Ah the  trembling of never-ended space, as one moves in flight! Space, and the  frail vibration of space, the glad lonely wringing of the heart. Not to  be clogged to the land any more. Not to be any more like a donkey with a  log on its leg, fastened to weary earth that has no answer now. But to  be off.    To find three masculine, world-lost souls, and world-lost saunter, and  saunter on along with them, across the dithering space, as long as life  lasts! Why come to anchor? There is nothing to anchor for. Land has no  answer to the soul any more. It has gone inert. Give me a little ship,  kind gods, and three world-lost comrades. Hear me! And let me wander  aimless across this vivid outer world, the world empty of man, where  space flies happily.           *       *       *       *       *    The lovely, celandine-yellow morning of the open sea, paling towards a  rare, sweet blue! The sun stood above the horizon, like the great  burning stigma of the sacred flower of day. Mediterranean sailing-ships,  so mediaeval, hovered on the faint morning wind, as if uncertain which  way to go, curious, odd-winged insects of the flower. The steamer,  hull-down, was sinking towards Spain. Space rang clear about us: the  level sea!    Appeared the Cagliari young woman and her two friends. She was looking  handsome and restored now the sea was easy. Her two male friends stood  touching her, one at either shoulder.    \"Bonjour, Monsieur!\" she barked across at me. \"Vous avez pris le cafe?\"    \"Pas encore. Et vous?\"    \"Non! Madame votre femme....\"    She roared like a mastiff dog: and then translated with unction to her  two uninitiated friends. How it was they did not understand her French I  do not know, it was so like travestied Italian.    I went below to find the q-b.           *       *       *       *       *    When we came up, the faint shape of land appeared ahead, more  transparent than thin pearl. Already Sardinia. Magic are high lands seen  from the sea, when they are far, far off, and ghostly translucent like  ice-bergs. This was Sardinia, looming like fascinating shadows in  mid-sea. And the sailing ships, as if cut out of frailest pearl  translucency, were wafting away towards Naples. I wanted to count their  sails--five square ones which I call the ladder, one above the  other--but how many wing-blades? That remained yet to be seen.           *       *       *       *       *    Our friend the carpenter spied us out: at least, he was not my friend.  He didn't find me _simpatico_, I am sure. But up he came, and proceeded  to entertain us with weary banality. Again the young woman called, had  we had coffee? We said we were just going down. And then she said that  whatever we had today we had to pay for: our food ended with the one  day. At which the q-b was angry, feeling swindled. But I had known  before.           *       *       *       *       *    We went down and had our coffee notwithstanding. The young woman came  down, and made eyes at one of the alpaca blue-bottles. After which we  saw a cup of coffee and milk and two biscuits being taken to her into  her cabin, discreetly. When Italians are being discreet and on the sly,  the very air about them becomes tell-tale, and seems to shout with a  thousand tongues. So with a thousand invisible tongues clamouring the  fact, the young woman had her coffee secretly and _gratis_, in her  cabin.           *       *       *       *       *    But the morning was lovely. The q-b and I crept round the bench at the  very stern of the ship and sat out of the wind and out of sight, just  above the foaming of the wake. Before us was the open morning--and the  glisten of our ship's track, like a snail's path, trailing across the  sea: straight for a little while, then giving a bend to the left, always  a bend towards the left: and coming at us from the pure horizon, like a  bright snail-path. Happy it was to sit there in the stillness, with  nothing but the humanless sea to shine about us.    But no, we were found out. Arrived the carpenter.    \"Ah, you have found a fine place--!\"    \"Molto bello!\" This from the q-b. I could not bear the irruption.    He proceeded to talk--and as is inevitable, the war. Ah, the war--it was  a terrible thing. He had become ill--very ill. Because, you see, not  only do you go without proper food, without proper rest and warmth, but,  you see, you are in an agony of fear for your life all the time. An  agony of fear for your life. And that's what does it. Six months in  hospital--! The q-b, of course, was sympathetic.    The Sicilians are quite simple about it. They just tell you they were  frightened to death, and it made them ill. The q-b, woman-like, loves  them for being so simple about it. I feel angry somewhere. For they  _expect_ a full-blown sympathy. And however the great god Mars may have  shrunk and gone wizened in the world, it still annoys me to hear him  _so_ blasphemed.           *       *       *       *       *    Near us the automatic log was spinning, the thin rope trailing behind us  in the sea. Erratically it jerked and spun, with spasmodic torsion. He  explained that the little screw at the end of the line spun to the  speed of travelling. We were going from ten to twelve Italian miles to  the hour. Ah, yes, we _could_ go twenty. But we went no faster than ten  or twelve, to save the coal.    The coal--il carbone! I knew we were in for it. England--l'Inghilterra  she has the coal. And what does she do? She sells it very dear.  Particularly to Italy. Italy won the war and now can't even have coal.  Because why! The price. The exchange! _Il cambio._ Now I am doubly in  for it. Two countries had been able to keep their money high--England  and America. The English sovereign--la sterlina--and the American  dollar--_sa_, these were money. The English and the Americans flocked to  Italy, with their _sterline_ and their _dollari_, and they bought what  they wanted for nothing, for nothing. Ecco! Whereas we poor Italians--we  are in a state of ruination--proper ruination. The allies, etc., etc.    I am so used to it--I am so wearily used to it. I can't walk a stride  without having this wretched _cambio_, the exchange, thrown at my head.  And this with an injured petulant spitefulness which turns my blood. For  I assure them, whatever I have in Italy I pay for: and I am not England.  I am not the British Isles on two legs.    Germany--La Germania--she did wrong to make the war. But--there you  are, that was war. Italy and Germany--l'Italia e la Germania--they had  always been friends. In Palermo....    My God, I felt I could not stand it another second. To sit above the  foam and have this miserable creature stuffing wads of chewed newspaper  into my ear--no, I could not bear it. In Italy, there is no escape. Say  two words, and the individual starts chewing old newspaper and stuffing  it into you. No escape. You become--if you are English--_l'Inghilterra_,  _il carbone_, and _il cambio_; and as England, coal and exchange you are  treated. It is more than useless to try to be human about it. You are a  State usury system, a coal fiend and an exchange thief. Every Englishman  has disappeared into this triple abstraction, in the eyes of the  Italian, of the proletariat particularly. Try and get them to be human,  try and get them to see that you are simply an individual, if you can.  After all, I am no more than a single human man wandering my lonely way  across these years. But no--to an Italian I am a perfected abstraction,  England--coal--exchange. The Germans were once devils for inhuman  theoretic abstracting of living beings. But now the Italians beat them.  I am a walking column of statistics, which adds up badly for Italy.  Only this and nothing more. Which being so, I shut my mouth and walk  away.           *       *       *       *       *    For the moment the carpenter is shaken off. But I am in a rage, fool  that I am. It is like being pestered by their mosquitoes. The sailing  ships are near--and I count fifteen sails. Beautiful they look! Yet if I  were on board somebody would be chewing newspaper at me, and addressing  me as England--coal--exchange.    The mosquito hovers--and hovers. But the stony blank of the side of my  cheek keeps him away. Yet he hovers. And the q-b feels sympathetic  towards him: quite sympathetic. Because of course he treats her--a _bel  pezzo_--as if he would lick her boots, or anything else that she would  let him lick.           *       *       *       *       *    Meanwhile we eat the apples from yesterday's dessert, and the remains of  the q-b's Infant-Jesus-and-dove cake. The land is drawing nearer--we can  see the shape of the end promontory and peninsula--and a white speck  like a church. The bulk of the land is forlorn and rather shapeless,  coming towards us: but attractive.    Looking ahead towards the land gives us away. The mosquito swoops on us.  Yes--he is not sure--he thinks the white speck is a church--or a  lighthouse. When you pass the cape on the right, and enter the wide bay  between Cape Spartivento and Cape Carbonara, then you have two hours  sail to Cagliari. We shall arrive between two and three o'clock. It is  now eleven.    Yes, the sailing ships are probably going to Naples. There is not much  wind for them now. When there is wind they go fast, faster than our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#11)"],[1,"ed, but assured them that, as soon as the defences of  the fort should be completed, a search should be begun in earnest for  the Appalachian gold mine, and that meanwhile two small vessels then  building on the river should be sent along the coast to barter for  provisions with the Indians. With this answer they were forced to  content themselves; but the fermentation continued, and the plot  thickened. Their spokesman, La Caille, however, seeing whither the  affair tended, broke with them, and, except Ottigny, Yasseur, and the  brave Swiss Arlac, was the only officer who held to his duty.    A severe illness again seized Laudonniere, and confined him to his bed.  Improving their advantage, the malcontents gained over nearly all the  best soldiers in the fort. The ringleader was one Fourneaux, a man of  good birth, but whom Le Moyne calls an avaricious hypocrite. He drew up  a paper, to which sixty-six names were signed. La Caille boldly opposed  the conspirators, and they resolved to kill him. His room-mate, Le  Moyne, who had also refused to sign, received a hint of the design from  a friend; upon which he warned La Caille, who escaped to the woods. It  was late in the night. Fourneaux, with twenty men armed to the teeth,  knocked fiercely at the commandant's door. Forcing an entrance, they  wounded a gentleman who opposed them, and crowded around the sick man's  bed. Fourneaux, armed with steel cap and cuirass, held his arquebuse  to Laudonniere's throat, and demanded leave to go on a cruise among the  Spanish islands. The latter kept his presence of mind, and remonstrated  with some firmness; on which, with oaths and menaces, they dragged him  from his bed, put him in fetters, carried him out to the gate of the  fort, placed him in a boat, and rowed him to the ship anchored in the  river.    Two other gangs at the same time visited Ottigny and Arlac, whom they  disarmed, and ordered to keep their rooms till the night following, on  pain of death. Smaller parties were busied, meanwhile, in disarming  all the loyal soldiers. The fort was completely in the hands of the  conspirators. Fourneaux drew up a commission for his meditated  West India cruise, which he required Laudonniere to sign. The sick  commandant, imprisoned in the ship with one attendant, at first refused;  but receiving a message from the mutineers, that, if he did not comply,  they would come on board and cut his throat, he at length yielded.    The buccaneers now bestirred themselves to finish the two small vessels  on which the carpenters had been for some time at work. In a fortnight  they were ready for sea, armed and provided with the King's cannon,  munitions, and stores. Trenchant, an excellent pilot, was forced to join  the party. Their favorite object was the plunder of a certain church  on one of the Spanish islands, which they proposed to assail during  the midnight mass of Christmas, whereby a triple end would be achieved:  first, a rich booty; secondly, the punishment of idolatry; thirdly,  vengeance on the arch-enemies of their party and their faith. They set  sail on the eighth of December, taunting those who remained, calling  them greenhorns, and threatening condign punishment if, on their  triumphant return, they should be refused free entrance to the fort.    They were no sooner gone than the unfortunate Laudonniere was gladdened  in his solitude by the approach of his fast friends Ottigny and Arlac,  who conveyed him to the fort and reinstated him. The entire command  was reorganized, and new officers appointed. The colony was wofully  depleted; but the bad blood had been drawn off, and thenceforth all  internal danger was at an end. In finishing the fort, in building two  new vessels to replace those of which they had been robbed, and in  various intercourse with the tribes far and near, the weeks passed until  the twenty-fifth of March, when an Indian came in with the tidings that  a vessel was hovering off the coast. Laudonniere sent to reconnoitre.  The stranger lay anchored at the mouth of the river. She was a Spanish  brigantine, manned by the returning mutineers, starving, downcast, and  anxious to make terms. Yet, as their posture seemed not wholly pacific,  Landonniere sent down La Caille, with thirty soldiers concealed at  the bottom of his little vessel. Seeing only two or three on deck, the  pirates allowed her to come alongside; when, to their amazement, they  were boarded and taken before they could snatch their arms. Discomfited,  woebegone, and drunk, they were landed under a guard. Their story was  soon told. Fortune had flattered them at the outset, and on the coast  of Cuba they took a brigantine laden with wine and stores. Embarking in  her, they next fell in with a caravel, which also they captured. Landing  at a village in Jamaica, they plundered and caroused for a week, and  had hardly re-embarked when they met a small vessel having on board the  governor of the island. She made a desperate fight, but was taken at  last, and with her a rich booty. They thought to put the governor  to ransom but the astute official deceived them, and, on pretence of  negotiating for the sum demanded,--together with \"four or six parrots,  and as many monkeys of the sort called sanguins, which are very  beautiful,\" and for which his captors had also bargained,--contrived to  send instructions to his wife. Hence it happened that at daybreak three  armed vessels fell upon them, retook the prize, and captured or killed  all the pirates but twenty-six, who, cutting the moorings of their  brigantine, fled out to sea. Among these was the ringleader Fourneaux,  and also the pilot Trenchant, who, eager to return to Fort Caroline,  whence he had been forcibly taken, succeeded during the night in  bringing the vessel to the coast of Florida. Great were the wrath and  consternation of the pirates when they saw their dilemma; for, having  no provisions, they must either starve or seek succor at the fort. They  chose the latter course, and bore away for the St. John's. A few casks  of Spanish wine yet remained, and nobles and soldiers, fraternizing  in the common peril of a halter, joined in a last carouse. As the wine  mounted to their heads, in the mirth of drink and desperation,  they enacted their own trial. One personated the judge, another the  commandant; witnesses were called, with arguments and speeches on either  side.    \"Say what you like,\" said one of them, after hearing the counsel for the  defence; \"but if Laudonniere does not hang us all, I will never call him  an honest man.\"    They had some hope of getting provisions from the Indians at the month  of the river, and then putting to sea again; but this was frustrated  by La Caille's sudden attack. A court-martial was called near Fort  Caroline, and all were found guilty. Fourneaux and three others were  sentenced to be hanged.    \"Comrades,\" said one of the condemned, appealing to the soldiers, \"will  you stand by and see us butchered?\"    \"These,\" retorted Laudonniere, \"are no comrades of mutineers and  rebels.\"    At the request of his followers, however, he commuted the sentence to  shooting.    A file of men, a rattling volley, and the debt of justice was paid. The  bodies were hanged on gibbets, at the river's mouth, and order reigned  at Fort Caroline.          CHAPTER VI. 1564, 1565.    FAMINE. WAR. SUCCOR.      While the mutiny was brewing, one La Roche Ferriere had been sent out as  an agent or emissary among the more distant tribes. Sagacious, bold,  and restless, he pushed his way from town to town, and pretended to  have reached the mysterious mountains of Appalache. He sent to the fort  mantles woven with feathers, quivers covered with choice furs, arrows  tipped with gold, wedges of a green stone like beryl or emerald, and  other trophies of his wanderings. A gentleman named Grotaut took up  the quest, and penetrated to the dominions of Hostaqua, who, it was  pretended, could muster three or four thousand warriors, and who  promised, with the aid of a hundred arquebusiers, to conquer all the  kings of the adjacent mountains, and subject them and their gold mines  to the rule of the French. A humbler adventurer was Pierre Gambie, a  robust and daring youth, who had been brought up in the household of  Coligny, and was now a soldier under Laudonniere. The latter gave him  leave to trade with the Indians,--a privilege which he used so well that  he grew rich with his traffic, became prime favorite with the chief  of the island of Edelano, married his daughter, and, in his absence,  reigned in his stead. But, as his sway verged towards despotism, his  subjects took offence, and split his head with a hatchet.    During the winter, Indians from the neighborhood of Cape Canaveral  brought to the fort two Spaniards, wrecked fifteen years before on the  southwestern extremity of the peninsula. They were clothed like the  Indians,--in other words, were not clothed at all,--and their uncut hair  streamed loose down their backs. They brought strange tales of those  among whom they had dwelt. They told of the King of Cabs, on whose  domains they had been wrecked, a chief mighty in stature and in power.  In one of his villages was a pit, six feet deep and as wide as a  hogshead, filled with treasure gathered from Spanish wrecks on adjacent  reefs and keys. The monarch was a priest too, and a magician, with power  over the elements. Each year he withdrew from the public gaze to hold  converse in secret with supernal or infernal powers; and each year he  sacrificed to his gods one of the Spaniards whom the fortune of the sea  had cast upon his shores. The name of the tribe is preserved in that of  the river Caboosa. In close league with him was the mighty Oathcaqua,  dwelling near Cape Canaveral, who gave his daughter, a maiden of  wondrous beauty, in marriage to his great ally. But as the bride with  her bridesmaids was journeying towards Calos, escorted by a"]]]
