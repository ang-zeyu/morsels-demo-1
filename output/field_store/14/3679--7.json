General Byng, \"Bungo Byng,\" as he was called by his troops, won the  admiration of the Canadian Corps which he commanded, and afterward, in  the Cambrai advance of November, '17, he showed daring of conception  and gained the first striking surprise in the war by novel methods of  attack--spoiled by the quick come-back of the enemy under Von Marwitz  and our withdrawal from Bourlon Wood, Masnieres, and Marcoing, and other  places, after desperate fighting.    His chief of staff, Gen. Louis Vaughan, was a charming, gentle-mannered  man, with a scientific outlook on the problems of war, and so kind in  his expression and character that it seemed impossible that he could  devise methods of killing Germans in a wholesale way. He was like an  Oxford professor of history discoursing on the Marlborough wars, though  when I saw him many times outside the Third Army headquarters, in  a railway carriage, somewhere near Villers Carbonnel on the Somme  battlefields, he was explaining his preparations and strategy for  actions to be fought next day which would be of bloody consequence to  our men and the enemy.    General Birdwood, commanding the Australian Corps, and afterward the  Fifth Army in succession to General Gough, was always known as \"Birdie\"  by high and low, and this dapper man, so neat, so bright, so brisk, had  a human touch with him which won him the affection of all his troops.    Gen. Hunter Weston, of the 8th Corps, was another man of character in  high command. He spoke of himself in the House of Commons one day as  \"a plain, blunt soldier,\" and the army roared with laughter from end to  end. There was nothing plain or blunt about him. He was a man of airy  imagination and a wide range of knowledge, and theories on life and war  which he put forward with dramatic eloquence.    It was of Gen. Hunter Weston that the story was told about the drunken  soldier put onto a stretcher and covered with a blanket, to get him out  of the way when the army commander made a visit to the lines.    \"What's this?\" said the general.    \"Casualty, sir,\" said the quaking platoon commander.    \"Not bad, I hope?\"    \"Dead, sir,\" said the subaltern. He meant dead drunk.    The general drew himself up, and said, in his dramatic way, \"The army  commander salutes the honored dead!\"    And the drunken private put his head from under the blanket and asked,  \"What's the old geezer a-sayin' of?\"    That story may have been invented in a battalion mess, but it went  through the army affixed to the name of Hunter Weston, and seemed to fit  him.    The 8th Corps was on the left in the first attack on the Somme, when  many of our divisions were cut to pieces in the attempt to break the  German line at Gommecourt. It was a ghastly tragedy, which spoiled the  success on the right at Fricourt and Montauban. But Gen. Hunter Weston  was not degomme, as the French would say, and continued to air his  theories on life and warfare until the day of Victory, when once again  we had \"muddled through,\" not by great generalship, but by the courage  of common men.    Among the divisional generals with whom I came in contact--I met most  of them at one time or another--were General Hull of the 56th (London)  Division, General Hickey of the 16th (Irish) Division, General Harper  of the 51st (Highland) Division, General Nugent of the 36th (Ulster)  Division, and General Pinnie of the 35th (Bantams) Division, afterward  of the 33d.    General Hull was a handsome, straight-speaking, straight-thinking man,  and I should say an able general. \"Ruthless,\" his men said, but this was  a war of ruthlessness, because life was cheap. Bitter he was at times,  because he had to order his men to do things which he knew were folly.  I remember sitting on the window-sill of his bedroom, in an old house of  Arras, while he gave me an account of \"the battle in the dark,\" in which  the Londoners and other English troops lost their direction and found  themselves at dawn with the enemy behind them. General Hull made no  secret of the tragedy or the stupidity... On another day I met him  somewhere on the other side of Peronne, before March 21st, when he was  commanding the 16th (Irish) Division in the absence of General Hickey,  who was ill. He talked a good deal about the belief in a great German  offensive, and gave many reasons for thinking it was all \"bluff.\" A  few days later the enemy had rolled over his lines... Out of thirteen  generals I met at that time, there were only three who believed that the  enemy would make his great assault in a final effort to gain decisive  victory, though our Intelligence had amassed innumerable proofs and were  utterly convinced of the approaching menace.    \"They will never risk it!\" said General Gorringe of the 47th (London)  Division. \"Our lines are too strong. We should mow them down.\"    I was standing with him on a wagon, watching the sports of the London  men. We could see the German lines, south of St.-Quentin, very quiet  over there, without any sign of coming trouble. A few days later the  place where we were standing was under waves of German storm-troops.    I liked the love of General Hickey for his Irish division. An Irishman  himself, with a touch of the old Irish soldier as drawn by Charles  Lever, gay-hearted, proud of his boys, he was always pleased to see me  because he knew I had a warm spot in my heart for the Irish troops. He  had a good story to tell every time, and passed me on to \"the boys\" to  get at the heart of them. It was long before he lost hope of keeping the  division together, though it was hard to get recruits and losses were  high at Guillemont and Ginchy. For the first time he lost heart and was  very sad when the division was cut to pieces in a Flanders battle.  It lost 2,000 men and 162 officers before the battle began--they were  shelled to death in the trenches--and 2,000 men and 170 officers more  during the progress of the battle. It was murderous and ghastly.    General Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division, afterward commanding the  4th Corps, had the respect of his troops, though they called him \"Uncle\"  because of his shock of white hair. The Highland division, under his  command, fought many battles and gained great honor, even from the  enemy, who feared them and called the kilted men \"the ladies from hell.\"  It was to them the Germans sent their message in a small balloon  during the retreat from the Somme: \"Poor old 51st. Still sticking it!  Cheery-oh!\"    \"Uncle\" Harper invited me to lunch in his mess, and was ironical  with war correspondents, and censors, and the British public, and new  theories of training, and many things in which he saw no sense. There  was a smoldering passion in him which glowed in his dark eyes.    He was against bayonet-training, which took the field against rifle-fire  for a time.    \"No man in this war,\" he said, with a sweeping assertion, \"has ever been  killed by the bayonet unless he had his hands up first.\" And, broadly  speaking, I think he was right, in spite of the Director of Training,  who was extremely annoyed with me when I quoted this authority.          XX      I met many other generals who were men of ability, energy, high sense  of duty, and strong personality. I found them intellectually, with few  exceptions, narrowly molded to the same type, strangely limited in their  range of ideas and qualities of character.    \"One has to leave many gaps in one's conversation with generals,\" said a  friend of mine, after lunching with an army commander.    That was true. One had to talk to them on the lines of leading articles  in The Morning Post. Their patriotism, their knowledge of human nature,  their idealism, and their imagination were restricted to the traditional  views of English country gentlemen of the Tory school. Anything outside  that range of thought was to them heresy, treason, or wishy-washy  sentiment.    What mainly was wrong with our generalship was the system which put  the High Command into the hands of a group of men belonging to the old  school of war, unable, by reason of their age and traditions, to get  away from rigid methods and to become elastic in face of new conditions.    Our Staff College had been hopelessly inefficient in its system of  training, if I am justified in forming such an opinion from specimens  produced by it, who had the brains of canaries and the manners of  Potsdam. There was also a close corporation among the officers of the  Regular Army, so that they took the lion's share of staff appointments,  thus keeping out brilliant young men of the new armies, whose  brain-power, to say the least of it, was on a higher level than that of  the Sandhurst standard. Here and there, where the unprofessional soldier  obtained a chance of high command or staff authority, he proved the  value of the business mind applied to war, and this was seen very  clearly--blindingly--in the able generalship of the Australian Corps, in  which most of the commanders, like Generals Hobbs, Monash, and others,  were men in civil life before the war. The same thing was observed in  the Canadian Corps, General Currie, the corps commander, having been  an estate agent, and many of his high officers having had no military  training of any scientific importance before they handled their own men  in France and Flanders.          XXI      As there are exceptions to every rule, so harsh criticism must be  modified in favor of the generalship and organization of the Second  Army-of rare efficiency under the restrictions and authority of the  General Staff. I often used to wonder what qualities belonged to Sir  Herbert Plumer, the army commander. In appearance "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#11)"],[1,"be yours.  I call to witness that dreadful  lake, which I never saw, but which we gods swear by in our most  solemn engagements.\"  Phaeton immediately asked to be permitted  for one day to drive the chariot of the sun.  The father repented  of his promise; thrice and four times he shook his radiant head  in warning.  \"I have spoken rashly,\" said he; \"only this request  I would fain deny.  I beg you to withdraw it.  It is not a safe  boon, nor one, my Phaeton, suited to your youth and strength.  Your lot is mortal, and you ask what is beyond a mortal's power.  In your ignorance you aspire to do that which not even the gods  themselves may do.  None but myself may drive the flaming car of  day; not even Jupiter, whose terrible right arm hurls the thunder  bolts.  The first part of the way is steep, and such as the  horses when fresh in the morning can hardly climb; the middle is  high up in the heavens, whence I myself can scarcely, without  alarm, look down and behold the earth and sea stretched beneath  me.  The last part of the road descends rapidly, and requires  most careful driving.  Tethys, who is waiting to receive me,  often trembles for me lest I should fall headlong.  Add to all  this, the heaven is all the time turning round and carrying the  stars with it.  I have to be perpetually on my guard lest that  movement, which sweeps everything else along, should hurry me  also away.  Suppose I should lend you the chariot, what would you  do?  Could you keep your course while the sphere was revolving  under you?  Perhaps you think that there are forests and cities,  the abodes of gods, and palaces and temples on the way.  On the  contrary, the road is through the midst of frightful monsters.  You pass by the horns of the Bull, in front of the Archer, and  near the Lion's jaws, and where the Scorpion stretches its arms  in one direction and the Crab in another.  Nor will you find it  easy to guide those horses, with their breasts full of fire which  they breathe forth from their mouths and nostrils.  I can  scarcely govern them myself, when they are unruly and resist the  reins.  Beware, my son, lest I should give you a fatal gift;  recall your request while yet you may.  Do you ask me for proof  that you are sprung from my blood?  I give you a proof in my  fears for you.  Look at my face,-- I would that you could look  into my breast, you would there see all a father's anxiety.  Finally,\" he continued, \"look round the world and choose whatever  you will of what earth or sea contains most precious,   ask it  and fear no refusal.  This only I pray you not to urge.  It is  not honor, but destruction you seek.  Why do you hang round my  neck and still entreat me?  You shall have it if you persist,  the oath is sworn and must be kept,   but I beg you to choose  more wisely.\"    He ended; but the youth rejected all admonition, and held to his  demand.  So, having resisted as long as he could, Phoebus at last  led the way to where stood the lofty chariot.    It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan; the axle was of gold, the  pole and wheels of gold, the spokes of silver.  Along the seat  were rows of chrysolites and diamonds, which reflected all around  the brightness of the sun.  While the daring youth gazed in  admiration, the early Dawn threw open the purple doors of the  east, and showed the pathway strewn with roses.  The stars  withdrew, marshalled by the Daystar, which last of all retired  also.  The father, when he saw the earth beginning to glow, and  the Moon preparing to retire, ordered the Hours to harness up the  horses.  They obeyed, and led forth from the lofty stalls the  steeds full fed with ambrosia, and attached the reins.  Then the  father bathed the face of his son with a powerful unguent, and  made him capable of enduring the brightness of the flame.  He set  the rays on his head, and, with a foreboding sigh, said, \"If, my  son, you will in this at least heed my advice, spare the whip and  hold tight the reins.  They go fast enough of their own accord;  the labor is to hold them in.  You are not to take the straight  road directly between the five circles, but turn off to the left.  Keep within the limit of the middle zone, and avoid the northern  and the southern alike.  You will see the marks of the wheels,  and they will serve to guide you.  And, that the skies and the  earth may each receive their due share of heat, go not too high,  or you will burn the heavenly dwellings, nor too low, or you will  set the earth on fire; the middle course is safest and best.  And  now I leave you to your chance, which I hope will plan better for  you than you have done for yourself.  Night is passing out of the  western gates and we can delay no longer.  Take the reins; but if  at last your heart fails you, and you will benefit by my advice,  stay where you are in safety, and suffer me to light and warm the  earth.\"  The agile youth sprang into the chariot, stood erect and  grasped the reins with delight, pouring out thanks to his  reluctant parent.    Meanwhile the horses fill the air with their snortings and fiery  breath, and stamp the ground impatient.  Now the bars are let  down, and the boundless plain of the universe lies open before  them.  They dart forward and cleave the opposing clouds, and  outrun the morning breezes which started from the same eastern  goal.  The steeds soon perceived that the load they drew was  lighter than usual; and as a ship without ballast is tossed  hither and thither on the sea, so the chariot, without its  accustomed weight, was dashed about as if empty.  They rush  headlong and leave the travelled road.  He is alarmed, and knows  not how to guide them; nor, if he knew, has he the power.  Then,  for the first time, the Great and Little Bear were scorched with  heat, and would fain, if it were possible, have plunged into the  water; and the Serpent which lies coiled up round the north pole,  torpid and harmless, grew warm, and with warmth felt its rage  revive.  Bootes, they say, fled away, though encumbered with his  plough, and all unused to rapid motion.    When hapless Phaeton looked down upon the earth, now spreading in  vast extent beneath him, he grew pale and his knees shook with  terror.  In spite of the glare all around him, the sight of his  eyes grew dim.  He wished he had never touched his father's  horses, never learned his parentage, never prevailed in his  request.  He is borne along like a vessel that flies before a  tempest, when the pilot can do no more and betakes himself to his  prayers.  What shall he do?  Much of the heavenly road is left  behind, but more remains before.  He turns his eyes from one  direction to the other; now to the goal whence he began his  course, now to the realms of sunset which he is not destined to  reach.  He loses his self-command, and knows not what to do,  whether to draw tight the reins or throw them loose; he forgets  the names of the horses.  He sees with terror the monstrous forms  scattered over the surface of heaven.  Here the Scorpion extended  his two great arms, with his tail and crooked claws stretching  over two signs of the zodiac.  When the boy beheld him, reeking  with poison and menacing with his fangs, his courage failed, and  the reins fell from his hands.  The horses, feeling the reins  loose on their backs, dashed headlong, and unrestrained went off  into unknown regions of the sky, in among the stars, hurling the  chariot over pathless places, now up in high heaven, now down  almost to the earth.  The moon saw with astonishment her  brother's chariot running beneath her own.  The clouds begin to  smoke, and the mountain tops take fire; the fields are parched  with heat, the plants wither, the trees with their leafy branches  burn, the harvest is ablaze!  But these are small things.  Great  cities perished, with their walls and towers; whole nations with  their people were consumed to ashes!  The forest-clad mountains  burned, Athos and Taurus and Tmolus and OEte; Ida, once  celebrated for fountains, but now all dry; the Muses' mountain  Helicon, and Haemus; AEtna, with fires within and without, and  Parnassus, with his two peaks, and Rhodope, forced at last to  part with his snowy crown.  Her cold climate was no protection to  Scythia, Caucasus burned, and Ossa and Pindus, and, greater than  both, Olympus; the Alps high in air, and the Apennines crowned  with clouds.    Then Phaeton beheld the world on fire, and felt the heat  intolerable.  The air he breathed was like the air of a furnace  and full of burning ashes, and the smoke was of a pitchy  darkness.  He dashed forward he knew not whither.  Then, it is  believed, the people of AEthiopia became black by the blood being  forced so suddenly to the surface, and the Libyan desert was  dried up to the condition in which it remains to this day.  The  Nymphs of the fountains, with dishevelled hair, mourned their  waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath their banks; Tanais  smoked, and Caicus, Xanthus and Meander.  Babylonian Euphrates  and Ganges, Tagus with golden sands, and Caijster where the swans  resort.  Nile fled away and hid his head in the desert, and there  it still remains concealed.  Where he used to discharge his  waters through seven mouths into the sea, there seven dry  channels alone remained.  The earth cracked open, and through the  chinks light broke into Tartarus, and frightened the king of  shadows and his queen.  The sea shrank up.  Where before was  water, it became a dry plain; and the mountains that lie beneath  the waves lifted up their heads and became islands.  The fishes  sought the lowest depths, and the dolphins no longer ventured as  usual to sport on the surface.  Even Nereus, and his wife Doris,  with the Nereids, their daughters, sought the deepest caves for  refuge.  Thrice Neptune essayed to raise his head above the  surface and thrice was driven back by the heat.  Earth,  surrounded as she was by waters,"]]]
