She ought to  have been a partisan of her father, for she was the member of his trio  who most \"made up\" to him for the disagreeables he didn't mention. In  his last days his general willingness to take leave of a world in which  the difficulty of doing as one liked appeared to increase as one grew  older had been sensibly modified by the pain of separation from his  clever, his superior, his remarkable girl. Later, when the journeys to  Europe ceased, he still had shown his children all sorts of indulgence,  and if he had been troubled about money-matters nothing ever disturbed  their irreflective consciousness of many possessions. Isabel, though she  danced very well, had not the recollection of having been in New York a  successful member of the choreographic circle; her sister Edith was,  as every one said, so very much more fetching. Edith was so striking  an example of success that Isabel could have no illusions as to what  constituted this advantage, or as to the limits of her own power to  frisk and jump and shriek--above all with rightness of effect. Nineteen  persons out of twenty (including the younger sister herself) pronounced  Edith infinitely the prettier of the two; but the twentieth, besides  reversing this judgement, had the entertainment of thinking all the  others aesthetic vulgarians. Isabel had in the depths of her nature an  even more unquenchable desire to please than Edith; but the depths of  this young lady's nature were a very out-of-the-way place, between which  and the surface communication was interrupted by a dozen capricious  forces. She saw the young men who came in large numbers to see her  sister; but as a general thing they were afraid of her; they had a  belief that some special preparation was required for talking with her.  Her reputation of reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy  envelope of a goddess in an epic; it was supposed to engender difficult  questions and to keep the conversation at a low temperature. The poor  girl liked to be thought clever, but she hated to be thought bookish;  she used to read in secret and, though her memory was excellent, to  abstain from showy reference. She had a great desire for knowledge, but  she really preferred almost any source of information to the printed  page; she had an immense curiosity about life and was constantly staring  and wondering. She carried within herself a great fund of life, and her  deepest enjoyment was to feel the continuity between the movements of  her own soul and the agitations of the world. For this reason she was  fond of seeing great crowds and large stretches of country, of reading  about revolutions and wars, of looking at historical pictures--a class  of efforts as to which she had often committed the conscious solecism of  forgiving them much bad painting for the sake of the subject. While the  Civil War went on she was still a very young girl; but she passed months  of this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which  she felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred  almost indiscriminately by the valour of either army. Of course the  circumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making  her a social proscript; for the number of those whose hearts, as they  approached her, beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads  as well, had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of  her sex and age. She had had everything a girl could have: kindness,  admiration, bonbons, bouquets, the sense of exclusion from none of the  privileges of the world she lived in, abundant opportunity for dancing,  plenty of new dresses, the London Spectator, the latest publications,  the music of Gounod, the poetry of Browning, the prose of George Eliot.    These things now, as memory played over them, resolved themselves into a  multitude of scenes and figures. Forgotten things came back to her; many  others, which she had lately thought of great moment, dropped out of  sight. The result was kaleidoscopic, but the movement of the instrument  was checked at last by the servant's coming in with the name of a  gentleman. The name of the gentleman was Caspar Goodwood; he was a  straight young man from Boston, who had known Miss Archer for the last  twelvemonth and who, thinking her the most beautiful young woman of her  time, had pronounced the time, according to the rule I have hinted at,  a foolish period of history. He sometimes wrote to her and had within a  week or two written from New York. She had thought it very possible he  would come in--had indeed all the rainy day been vaguely expecting him.  Now that she learned he was there, nevertheless, she felt no eagerness  to receive him. He was the finest young man she had ever seen, was  indeed quite a splendid young man; he inspired her with a sentiment of  high, of rare respect. She had never felt equally moved to it by any  other person. He was supposed by the world in general to wish to marry  her, but this of course was between themselves. It at least may be  affirmed that he had travelled from New York to Albany expressly to see  her; having learned in the former city, where he was spending a few  days and where he had hoped to find her, that she was still at the State  capital. Isabel delayed for some minutes to go to him; she moved about  the room with a new sense of complications. But at last she presented  herself and found him standing near the lamp. He was tall, strong and  somewhat stiff; he was also lean and brown. He was not romantically, he  was much rather obscurely, handsome; but his physiognomy had an air of  requesting your attention, which it rewarded according to the charm you  found in blue eyes of remarkable fixedness, the eyes of a complexion  other than his own, and a jaw of the somewhat angular mould which is  supposed to bespeak resolution. Isabel said to herself that it bespoke  resolution to-night; in spite of which, in half an hour, Caspar  Goodwood, who had arrived hopeful as well as resolute, took his way back  to his lodging with the feeling of a man defeated. He was not, it may be  added, a man weakly to accept defeat.        CHAPTER V    Ralph Touchett was a philosopher, but nevertheless he knocked at his  mother's door (at a quarter to seven) with a good deal of eagerness.  Even philosophers have their preferences, and it must be admitted  that of his progenitors his father ministered most to his sense of the  sweetness of filial dependence. His father, as he had often said to  himself, was the more motherly; his mother, on the other hand, was  paternal, and even, according to the slang of the day, gubernatorial.  She was nevertheless very fond of her only child and had always insisted  on his spending three months of the year with her. Ralph rendered  perfect justice to her affection and knew that in her thoughts and her  thoroughly arranged and servanted life his turn always came after the  other nearest subjects of her solicitude, the various punctualities of  performance of the workers of her will. He found her completely dressed  for dinner, but she embraced her boy with her gloved hands and made  him sit on the sofa beside her. She enquired scrupulously about her  husband's health and about the young man's own, and, receiving no  very brilliant account of either, remarked that she was more than ever  convinced of her wisdom in not exposing herself to the English climate.  In this case she also might have given way. Ralph smiled at the idea of  his mother's giving way, but made no point of reminding her that his  own infirmity was not the result of the English climate, from which he  absented himself for a considerable part of each year.    He had been a very small boy when his father, Daniel Tracy Touchett,  a native of Rutland, in the State of Vermont, came to England as  subordinate partner in a banking-house where some ten years later he  gained preponderant control. Daniel Touchett saw before him a life-long  residence in his adopted country, of which, from the first, he took a  simple, sane and accommodating view. But, as he said to himself, he had  no intention of disamericanising, nor had he a desire to teach his  only son any such subtle art. It had been for himself so very soluble a  problem to live in England assimilated yet unconverted that it seemed to  him equally simple his lawful heir should after his death carry on the  grey old bank in the white American light. He was at pains to intensify  this light, however, by sending the boy home for his education. Ralph  spent several terms at an American school and took a degree at an  American university, after which, as he struck his father on his return  as even redundantly native, he was placed for some three years in  residence at Oxford. Oxford swallowed up Harvard, and Ralph became  at last English enough. His outward conformity to the manners that  surrounded him was none the less the mask of a mind that greatly enjoyed  its independence, on which nothing long imposed itself, and which,  naturally inclined to adventure and irony, indulged in a boundless  liberty of appreciation. He began with being a young man of promise; at  Oxford he distinguished himself, to his father's ineffable satisfaction,  and the people about him said it was a thousand pities so clever a  fellow should be shut out from a career. He might have had a career  by returning to his own country (though this point is shrouded in  uncertainty) and even if Mr. Touchett had been willing to part with  him (which was not the case) it would have gone hard with him to put  a watery waste permanently between himself and the old man whom he  regarded as his best friend."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady â€” Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"that.  Don't amuse yourself too much, or I shall think you're doing it at my  expense.\"    Ralph shook his head. \"I'm not afraid of your not believing that I've  had great ideas for you.\"    \"What do you mean by my soaring and sailing?\" she pursued.    \"I've never moved on a higher plane than I'm moving on now. There's  nothing higher for a girl than to marry a--a person she likes,\" said  poor Isabel, wandering into the didactic.    \"It's your liking the person we speak of that I venture to criticise, my  dear cousin. I should have said that the man for you would have been a  more active, larger, freer sort of nature.\" Ralph hesitated, then added:  \"I can't get over the sense that Osmond is somehow--well, small.\" He had  uttered the last word with no great assurance; he was afraid she would  flash out again. But to his surprise she was quiet; she had the air of  considering.    \"Small?\" She made it sound immense.    \"I think he's narrow, selfish. He takes himself so seriously!\"    \"He has a great respect for himself; I don't blame him for that,\" said  Isabel. \"It makes one more sure to respect others.\"    Ralph for a moment felt almost reassured by her reasonable tone.    \"Yes, but everything is relative; one ought to feel one's relation to  things--to others. I don't think Mr. Osmond does that.\"    \"I've chiefly to do with his relation to me. In that he's excellent.\"    \"He's the incarnation of taste,\" Ralph went on, thinking hard how he  could best express Gilbert Osmond's sinister attributes without putting  himself in the wrong by seeming to describe him coarsely. He wished  to describe him impersonally, scientifically. \"He judges and measures,  approves and condemns, altogether by that.\"    \"It's a happy thing then that his taste should be exquisite.\"    \"It's exquisite, indeed, since it has led him to select you as  his bride. But have you ever seen such a taste--a really exquisite  one--ruffled?\"    \"I hope it may never be my fortune to fail to gratify my husband's.\"    At these words a sudden passion leaped to Ralph's lips. \"Ah, that's  wilful, that's unworthy of you! You were not meant to be measured in  that way--you were meant for something better than to keep guard over  the sensibilities of a sterile dilettante!\"    Isabel rose quickly and he did the same, so that they stood for a moment  looking at each other as if he had flung down a defiance or an insult.  But \"You go too far,\" she simply breathed.    \"I've said what I had on my mind--and I've said it because I love you!\"    Isabel turned pale: was he too on that tiresome list? She had a sudden  wish to strike him off. \"Ah then, you're not disinterested!\"    \"I love you, but I love without hope,\" said Ralph quickly, forcing a  smile and feeling that in that last declaration he had expressed more  than he intended.    Isabel moved away and stood looking into the sunny stillness of the  garden; but after a little she turned back to him. \"I'm afraid your talk  then is the wildness of despair! I don't understand it--but it doesn't  matter. I'm not arguing with you; it's impossible I should; I've only  tried to listen to you. I'm much obliged to you for attempting to  explain,\" she said gently, as if the anger with which she had just  sprung up had already subsided. \"It's very good of you to try to warn  me, if you're really alarmed; but I won't promise to think of what  you've said: I shall forget it as soon as possible. Try and forget it  yourself; you've done your duty, and no man can do more. I can't explain  to you what I feel, what I believe, and I wouldn't if I could.\" She  paused a moment and then went on with an inconsequence that Ralph  observed even in the midst of his eagerness to discover some symptom of  concession. \"I can't enter into your idea of Mr. Osmond; I can't do it  justice, because I see him in quite another way. He's not important--no,  he's not important; he's a man to whom importance is supremely  indifferent. If that's what you mean when you call him 'small,' then  he's as small as you please. I call that large--it's the largest thing  I know. I won't pretend to argue with you about a person I'm going to  marry,\" Isabel repeated. \"I'm not in the least concerned to defend Mr.  Osmond; he's not so weak as to need my defence. I should think it would  seem strange even to yourself that I should talk of him so quietly and  coldly, as if he were any one else. I wouldn't talk of him at all to any  one but you; and you, after what you've said--I may just answer you once  for all. Pray, would you wish me to make a mercenary marriage--what  they call a marriage of ambition? I've only one ambition--to be free to  follow out a good feeling. I had others once, but they've passed away.  Do you complain of Mr. Osmond because he's not rich? That's just what I  like him for. I've fortunately money enough; I've never felt so thankful  for it as to-day. There have been moments when I should like to go and  kneel down by your father's grave: he did perhaps a better thing than  he knew when he put it into my power to marry a poor man--a man who has  borne his poverty with such dignity, with such indifference. Mr. Osmond  has never scrambled nor struggled--he has cared for no worldly prize. If  that's to be narrow, if that's to be selfish, then it's very well. I'm  not frightened by such words, I'm not even displeased; I'm only sorry  that you should make a mistake. Others might have done so, but I'm  surprised that you should. You might know a gentleman when you see  one--you might know a fine mind. Mr. Osmond makes no mistakes! He knows  everything, he understands everything, he has the kindest, gentlest,  highest spirit. You've got hold of some false idea. It's a pity, but  I can't help it; it regards you more than me.\" Isabel paused a moment,  looking at her cousin with an eye illumined by a sentiment which  contradicted the careful calmness of her manner--a mingled sentiment,  to which the angry pain excited by his words and the wounded pride of  having needed to justify a choice of which she felt only the nobleness  and purity, equally contributed. Though she paused Ralph said  nothing; he saw she had more to say. She was grand, but she was highly  solicitous; she was indifferent, but she was all in a passion. \"What  sort of a person should you have liked me to marry?\" she asked suddenly.  \"You talk about one's soaring and sailing, but if one marries at all one  touches the earth. One has human feelings and needs, one has a heart in  one's bosom, and one must marry a particular individual. Your mother  has never forgiven me for not having come to a better understanding  with Lord Warburton, and she's horrified at my contenting myself with a  person who has none of his great advantages--no property, no title,  no honours, no houses, nor lands, nor position, nor reputation, nor  brilliant belongings of any sort. It's the total absence of all these  things that pleases me. Mr. Osmond's simply a very lonely, a very  cultivated and a very honest man--he's not a prodigious proprietor.\"    Ralph had listened with great attention, as if everything she said  merited deep consideration; but in truth he was only half thinking of  the things she said, he was for the rest simply accommodating himself  to the weight of his total impression--the impression of her ardent good  faith. She was wrong, but she believed; she was deluded, but she was  dismally consistent. It was wonderfully characteristic of her that,  having invented a fine theory, about Gilbert Osmond, she loved him not  for what he really possessed, but for his very poverties dressed out as  honours. Ralph remembered what he had said to his father about wishing  to put it into her power to meet the requirements of her imagination. He  had done so, and the girl had taken full advantage of the luxury. Poor  Ralph felt sick; he felt ashamed. Isabel had uttered her last words with  a low solemnity of conviction which virtually terminated the discussion,  and she closed it formally by turning away and walking back to the  house. Ralph walked beside her, and they passed into the court together  and reached the big staircase. Here he stopped and Isabel paused,  turning on him a face of elation--absolutely and perversely of  gratitude. His opposition had made her own conception of her conduct  clearer to her. \"Shall you not come up to breakfast?\" she asked.    \"No; I want no breakfast; I'm not hungry.\"    \"You ought to eat,\" said the girl; \"you live on air.\"    \"I do, very much, and I shall go back into the garden and take another  mouthful. I came thus far simply to say this. I told you last year that  if you were to get into trouble I should feel terribly sold. That's how  I feel to-day.\"    \"Do you think I'm in trouble?\"    \"One's in trouble when one's in error.\"    \"Very well,\" said Isabel; \"I shall never complain of my trouble to you!\"  And she moved up the staircase.    Ralph, standing there with his hands in his pockets, followed her with  his eyes; then the lurking chill of the high-walled court struck him and  made him shiver, so that he returned to the garden to breakfast on the  Florentine sunshine.        CHAPTER XXXV    Isabel, when she strolled in the Cascine with her lover, felt no impulse  to tell him how little he was approved at Palazzo Crescentini. The  discreet opposition offered to her marriage by her aunt and her cousin  made on the whole no great impression upon her; the moral of it was  simply that they disliked Gilbert Osmond. This dislike was not alarming  to Isabel; she scarcely even regretted it; for it served mainly to  throw into higher relief the fact, in every way so honourable, that she  married to please herself. One did other things to please other people;  one did this for a more personal satisfaction; and Isabel's satisfaction  was confirmed by her lover's admirable good conduct. Gilbert Osmond was  in love, and he had never deserved less than during "]]]
