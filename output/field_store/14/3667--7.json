She had a due estimate of those manufactured trees  which hard-worked \"Sabbath Schools\" get up for rewards of merit for the  children who have been regular, and at the last moment have saved  attendance-tickets enough. Nor did Alice MacNeil sit in judgment on  these. She had a due estimate of them. But for her Christmas-tree she  had two plans not included in those more meritorious buddings and  bourgeonings of the winter. First, she meant to get it up without any  help from anybody. And, secondly, she meant that the boys and girls who  had anything from it should be regular laners and by-way farers,--they  were to have no tickets of respectability,--they were not in any way to  buy their way in; but, for this once, those were to come in to a  Christmas-tree who happened to be ragged and in the streets when the  Christmas-tree was ready.    So Alice asked Mr. Williams, the minister, if she could have one of the  rooms in the vestry when Christmas eve came; and he, good saint, was  only too glad to let her. He offered, gently, his assistance in sifting  out the dirty boys and girls, intimating to Alice that there was dirt  and dirt; and that, even in those lowest depths which she was plunging  into, there were yet lower deeps which she might find it wise to shun.  But here Alice told him frankly that she would rather try her experiment  fairly through. Perhaps she was wrong, but she would like to see that  she was wrong in her own way. Any way, on Christmas eve, she wanted no  distinctions.    That part of her plan went bravely forward.    Her main difficulty came on the other side,--that she had too many to  help her. She was not able to carry out the first part of her plan, and  make or buy all her presents herself. For everybody was pleased with  this notion of a truly catholic or universal tree; and everybody wanted  to help. Well, if anybody would send her a box of dominos, or a  jack-knife, or an open-eye-shut-eye doll, who was Alice to say it should  not go on the tree? and when Mrs. Hesperides sent round a box of Fayal  oranges, who was Alice to say that the children should not have oranges?  And when Mr. Gorham Parsons sent in well-nigh a barrel full of  Hubbardston None-such apples, who was Alice to say they should not have  apples? So the tree grew and grew, and bore more and more fruit, till it  was clear that there would be more than eighty reliable presents on it,  besides apples and oranges, almonds and raisins galore.    Now you see this was a very great enlargement of Alice's plan; and it  brought her to grief, as you shall see. She had proposed a cosey little  tree for fifteen or twenty children. Well, if she had held to that, she  would have had no more than she and Lillie, and Mr. Williams, and Mr.  Gilmore, and John Flagg, and I, could have managed easily, particularly  if mamma was there too. There would have been room enough in the chapel  parlor; and it would have been, as I believe, just the pretty and  cheerful Christmas jollity that Alice meant it should be. But when it  came to eighty presents, and a company of eighty of the unwashed and  unticketed, it became quite a different thing.    For now Alice began to fear that there would not be children enough in  the highways and by-ways. So she started herself, as evening drew on,  with George, the old faithful black major-domo, and she walked through  the worst streets she knew anything of, of all those near the chapel;  and, whenever she saw a brat particularly dirty, or a group of brats  particularly forlorn, she sailed up gallantly, and, though she was  frightened to death, she invited them to the tree. She gave little  admittance cards, that said, \"7 o'clock, Christmas Eve, 507 Livingstone  Avenue,\" for fear the children would not remember. And she told Mr.  Flagg that he and Mr. Gilmore might take some cards and walk out toward  Williamsburg, and do the same thing, only they were to be sure that they  asked the dirtiest and most forlorn children they saw. There was a  friendly policeman with whom Alice had been brought into communication  by the boys in her father's office, and he also was permitted to give  notice of the tree. But he was also to be at the street door, armed  with the strong arm of \"The People of New York,\" and when the full quota  of eighty had been admitted he was to admit no more.    Ah me! My poor Alice issued her cards only too freely. Better indeed, it  seemed, had she held to her original plan; at least she thought so, and  thinks so to this day. But I am not so certain. A hard time she had of  it, however. Quarter of seven found the little Arabs in crowds around  the door, with hundreds of others who thought they also were to find out  what a \"free lunch\" was. The faithful officer Purdy was in attendance  also; he passed in all who had the cards; he sent away legions, let me  say, who had reason to dread him; but still there assembled a larger and  larger throng about the door. Alice and Lillie, and the young gentlemen,  and Mrs. MacNeil, were all at work up stairs, and the tree was a perfect  beauty at last. They lighted up, and nothing could have been more  lovely.    \"Let them in!\" said John Flagg rushing to the door, where expectant  knocks had been heard already. \"Let them in,--the smallest girls  first!\"    \"Smallest girls,\" indeed! The door swung open, and a tide of boy and  girl, girl and boy, boy big to hobble-de-hoy-dom, and girl big to  young-woman-dom, came surging in, wildly screaming, scolding, pushing,  and pulling. Omitting the profanity, these are the Christmas carols that  fell on Alice's ear.    \"Out o' that!\" \"Take that, then!\" \"Who are you?\" \"Hold your jaw!\"  \"Can't you behave decent?\" \"You lie!\" \"Get out of my light!\" \"Oh,  dear! you killed me!\" \"Who's killed?\" \"Golly! see there!\" \"I say, ma'am,  give me that pair of skates!\" \"Shut up--\" and so on, the howls being  more and more impertinent, as the shepherds who had come to adore became  more and more used to the position they were in.    Young Gilmore, who was willing to oblige Alice, but was not going to  stand any nonsense, and would have willingly knocked the heads together  of any five couples of this rebel rout, mounted on a corner of the  railing, which, by Mr. Williams's prescience had been built around the  tree, and addressed the riotous assembly.    They stopped to hear him, supposing he was to deliver the gifts, to  which they had been summoned.    He told them pretty roundly that if they did not keep the peace, and  stop crowding and yelling, they should all be turned out of doors; that  they were to pass the little girls and boys forward first, and that  nobody would have any thing to eat till this was done.    Some approach to obedience followed. A few little waifs were found, who  in decency could be called _little_ girls and boys. But, alas! as she  looked down from her chair, Alice felt as if most of her guests looked  like shameless, hulking big boys and big girls, only too well fitted to  grapple with the world, and only too eager to accept its gifts without  grappling. She and Lillie tried to forget this. They kissed a few little  girls, and saw the faintest gleam of pleasure on one or two little  faces. But there, also, the pleasure was almost extinct, in fear of the  big boys and big girls howling around.    So the howling began again, as the distribution went forward. \"Give me  that jack-knife!\" \"I say, Mister, I'm as big as he is,\" \"He had one  before and hid it,\" \"Be down, Tom Mulligan,--get off that fence or I'll  hide you,\" \"I don't want the book, give me them skates,\" \"You sha'n't  have the skates, I'll have 'em myself--\" and so on. John Flagg finally  knocked down Tom Mulligan, who had squeezed round behind the tree, in an  effort to steal something, and had the satisfaction of sending him  bellowing from the room, with his face covered with blood from his nose.  Gilmore, meanwhile, was rapidly distributing an orange and an apple to  each, which, while the oranges were sucked, gave a moment's quiet. Alice  and the ladies, badly frightened, were stripping the tree as fast as  they could, and at last announced that it was all clear, with almost as  eager joy as half an hour before they had announced that it was all  full. \"There's a candy horn on top, give me that.\" \"Give me that little  apple.\" \"Give me the old sheep.\" \"Hoo! hurrah, for the old sheep!\" This  of a little lamb which had been placed as an appropriate ornament in  front. Then began a howl about oranges. \"I want another orange.\" \"Bill's  got some, and I've got none.\" \"I say, Mister, give me an orange.\"    To which Mister replied, by opening the window, and speaking into the  street,--\"I say, Purdy, call four officers and come up and clear this  room.\"    The room did not wait for the officers: it cleared itself very soon on  this order, and was left a scene of wreck and dirt. Orange-peel trampled  down on the floor; cake thrown down and mashed to mud, intermixed with  that which had come in on boots, and the water which had been slobbered  over from hasty mugs; the sugar plums which had fallen in scrambles, and  little sprays of green too, trodden into the mass,--all made an aspect  of filth like a market side-walk. And poor Alice was half crying and  half laughing; poor Lillie was wholly crying. Gilmore and Flagg were  explaining to each other how gladly they would have thrashed the whole  set.    The thought uppermost in Alice's mind was that she had been a clear, out  and out fool! And that, probably, is the impression of the greater part  of the readers of her story,--or would have been the impression of any  one who only had her point of view.      CHAPTER II.    Perhaps the reader is willing to take another point of view.    As the group stood there, talking over the riot as Mrs. MacNeil called  it,--as John Flagg tried to make Alice laugh by bringing her a  half-piece of frosted pound-cake, and proving to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32505"],[0,"The Systematics of the Frogs of the Hyla Rubra Group in Middle America (#11)"],[1," two or more subgroups took place in South America prior to the late  Pliocene. At the end of the Pliocene, shortly after the closure of the  Colombian Portal, many South American animals migrated into Central  America (Simpson, 1943, Maldonado-Koerdell, 1964, and Savage, 1966). It  is likely that the _Hyla rubra_ group entered Central America at that  time; apparently two stocks (_rubra-elaeochroa-staufferi_ stock and  _boulengeri-foliamorta_ stock) migrated into Central America.    _Hyla elaeochroa_ is closely related to _rubra_ and probably  differentiated from _rubra_ through spatial isolation. Thus, we have  _elaeochroa_ in Central America and _rubra_ in South America; most  likely only in relatively recent times has _rubra_ migrated into  eastern Panama from northern South America. The differentiation and  dispersal of _elaeochroa_ and _staufferi_ took place in Central America  after the Pliocene. Probably the events of the Pleistocene resulted in  the isolation of populations. One of these (_Hyla staufferi_ stock) was  restricted in the subhumid Pacific lowlands, whereas the _Hyla  elaeochroa_ stock occupied the tropical wet forests of the Caribbean  lowlands. _Hyla elaeochroa_ apparently more closely resembled the  parental stock by being restricted to the tropical rain forests,  whereas _staufferi_ adapted to subhumid environments and thereby was  able to disperse throughout most of the subhumid regions of Central  America.    After geographical separation took place the initial genetic divergence  between the two populations was maintained by means of ecological and  ethological isolating mechanisms. Under these circumstances it can be  supposed that the different ecological preferences of _elaeochroa_ and  _staufferi_ depend on the climatic changes that took place during the  Pleistocene. On this basis it may be proposed that when the original  prototype broke up into the two incipient species, the _staufferi_  stock became physiologically and behaviorally adapted to subhumid  conditions and dispersed into dry areas of the lowlands of Middle  America. The tropical evergreen forests on the Caribbean side of lower  Central America and the uplift of the Talamanca range in the Pliocene  were barriers to the dispersal of _staufferi_. Consequently, this frog  dispersed along the Pacific lowlands.    At the present time _staufferi_ occupies the length of the Pacific  lowlands in Central America, except in the rainforest of the Golfo Duce  region, which apparently is a relict stand and now separates the ranges  of two subspecies of _Hyla staufferi_. This species crossed the central  Nicaraguan lowlands and reached the Caribbean lowlands of Nicaragua and  nuclear Central America. The species migrated through the subhumid  corridor in northern Honduras and eastern Guatemala (Comayagua Valley  in Honduras and the Motagua Valley of Guatemala) to the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec. Duellman (1960) hypothesized \"that during the times of  glacial advances (Pleistocene) the lowlands of the Isthmus probably  were more extensive and had more semiarid tropical environments than at  the present\" and that when semiarid environments were continuous from  the Pacific slope across the isthmus to the Gulf lowlands _staufferi_  and other amphibians migrated northward to southeastern Tamaulipas,  Mexico.    _Hyla elaeochroa_ dispersed along Caribbean lowland routes. This  species not only occurs in the wet forests of the Golfo Dulce region  but also in Guanacaste. It is possible that _elaeochroa_ entered  Guanacaste and moved to the Golfo Dulce region when the intervening  area was less xeric than now (Duellman, 1966b). _Hyla elaeochroa_  extended its range to eastern Nicaragua, but even though northeastern  Nicaragua has over 2,000 mm. of precipitation annually (Vivo Escoto,  1964), this species has not spread into Honduras and Guatemala.    _Hyla boulengeri_ is widespread in Amazonian and northern South  America, whereas _foliamorta_ occurs only in eastern Panama and in  north-central Colombia. The ancestral _boulengeri-foliamorta_ stock  probably invaded Central America in the late Pliocene and dispersed  through humid forested environments to Nicaragua. Apparently a  peripheral population established itself in the dry Pacific lowlands of  Panama. This population differentiated from _boulengeri_ of the humid  Caribbean lowlands and evolved into _foliamorta_, which subsequently  expanded its range into Colombia.
