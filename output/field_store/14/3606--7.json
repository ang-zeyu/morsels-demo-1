Mr. Murry is an old-time acquaintance of Mrs. O'Shaughnessy's. He has  a ranch down on the river somewhere. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy has not seen  him for years,--didn't know he lived up here. He had seen the  game-warden from whom she had procured her license, and so hunted up  our camp. He is an odd-looking individual, with sad eyes and a  drooping mouth which gives his face a most hopeless, reproachful  expression. His nose, however, seems to upset the original plan, for  it is long and thin and bent slightly to one side. His neck is long  and his Adam's apple seems uncertain as to where it belongs. At supper  Jerrine watched it as if fascinated until I sent her from the table  and went out to speak to her about gazing.    \"Why, mamma,\" she said, \"I had to look; he has swallowed something  that won't go either up or down, and I'm 'fraid he'll choke.\"    Although I can't brag about Mr. Murry's appearance, I can about his  taste, for he admires Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. It seems that in years gone  by he has made attempts to marry her.    As he got up from supper the first night he was with us, he said,  \"Mary Ellen, I have a real treat and surprise for you. Just wait a few  minutes, an' I'll bet you'll be happy.\"    We took our accustomed places around the fire, while Mr. Murry hobbled  his cayuse and took an odd-looking bundle from his saddle. He seated  himself and took from the bundle--an accordion! He set it upon his  knee and began pulling and pushing on it. He did what Mr. Struble said  was doling a doleful tune. Every one took it good-naturedly, but he  kept doling the doleful until little by little the circle thinned.    Our tent is as comfortable as can be. Now that it is snowing, we sit  around the stoves, and we should have fine times if Professor  Glenholdt could have a chance to talk; but we have to listen to \"Run,  Nigger, Run\" and \"The Old Gray Hoss Come A-tearin' Out The  Wilderness.\" I'll sing them to you when I come to Denver.                                  With much love to you,                                     ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          VIII    THE SEVENTH MAN                                    CLOUDCREST, October 10, 1914.    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    I wonder what you would do if you were here. But I reckon I had better  not anticipate, and so I will begin at the beginning. On the morning  of the eighth we held a council. The physician and the two students  had gone. All had their limit of elk except Mr. Haynes and myself. Our  licenses also entitled each of us to a deer, a mountain sheep, and a  bear. We had plenty of food, but it had snowed about a foot and I was  beginning to want to get out while the going was good. Two other  outfits had gone out. The doctor and the students hired them to haul  out their game. So we decided to stay on a week longer.    That morning Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and I melted snow and washed the  clothes. It was delightful to have nice soft water, and we enjoyed our  work; it was almost noon before we thought to begin dinner. I suppose  you would say lunch, but with us it is dinner. None of the men had  gone out that day.    Mr. Harkrudder was busy with his films and didn't come with the rest  when dinner was ready. When he did come, he was excited; he laid a  picture on the table and said, \"Do any of you recognize this?\"    It looked like a flash-light of our camping ground. It was a little  blurry, but some of the objects were quite clear. Our tent was a white  blotch except for the outlines; the wagons showed plainly. I didn't  think much of it as a picture, so I paid scant attention. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy gave it close scrutiny; presently she said, \"Oh, yis, I  see what it is. It's a puzzle picture and ye find the man. Here he is,  hidin' beyont the pine next the tent.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Harkrudder, \"but I had not expected just this. I am  working out some ideas of my own in photography, and this picture is  one of the experiments I tried the night of the storm. The result  doesn't prove my experiment either way. Where were you, Stewart,  during the storm?\"    \"Where should I be? I bided i' the bed,\" the Stewart said.    \"Well,\" said Harkrudder, \"I know where each of the other fellows was,  and none of them was in this direction. Now who is the seventh man?\"    I looked again, and, sure enough, there was a man in a crouching  position outlined against the tent wall. We were all excited, for it  was ten minutes past one when Harkrudder was out, and we couldn't  think why any one would be prowling about our camp at that time of the  night.    As Mr. Stewart and I had planned a long, beautiful ride, we set  out after dinner, leaving the rest yet at the table eating and  conjecturing about the \"stranger within our picture.\" I had hoped we  would come to ground level enough for a sharp, invigorating canter,  but our way was too rough. It was a joy to be out in the great, silent  forest. The snow made riding a little venturesome because the horses  slipped a great deal, but Chub is dependable even though he is lazy.  Clyde bestrode Mr. Haynes's Old Blue. We were headed for the cascades  on Clear Creek, to see the wonderful ice-caverns that the flying spray  is forming.    We had almost reached the cascades and were crossing a little  bowl-like valley, when an elk calf leaped out of the snow and ran a  few yards. It paused and finally came irresolutely back toward us. A  few steps farther we saw great, red splotches on the snow and the body  of a cow elk. Around it were the tracks of the faithful little calf.  It would stay by its mother until starvation or wild animals put an  end to its suffering. The cow was shot in half a dozen places, none of  them in a fatal spot; it had bled to death. \"That,\" said Mr. Stewart  angrily, \"comes o' bunch shooting. The authorities should revoke the  license of a man found guilty of bunch shooting.\"    We rode on in silence, each a little saddened by what we had seen. But  this was not all. We had begun to descend the mountain side to Clear  Creek when we came upon the beaten trail of a herd of elk. We followed  it as offering perhaps the safest descent. It didn't take us far.  Around the spur of the mountain the herd had stampeded; tracks were  everywhere. Lying in the trail were a spike and an old bull with a  broken antler. Chub shied, but Old Blue doesn't scare, so Mr. Stewart  rode up quite close. Around the heads were tell-tale tracks. We didn't  dismount, but we knew that the two upper teeth or tushes were missing  and that the hated tooth-hunter was at work. The tracks in the snow  showed there had been two men. An adult elk averages five hundred  pounds of splendid meat; here before us, therefore, lay a thousand  pounds of food thrown to waste just to enable a contemptible  tooth-hunter to obtain four teeth. Tooth-hunting is against the law,  but this is a case where you must catch before hanging.    Well, we saw the cascades, and after resting a little, we started  homeward through the heavy woods, where we were compelled to go more  slowly. We had dismounted, and were gathering some pinon cones from a  fallen tree, when, almost without a sound, a band of elk came trailing  down a little draw where a spring trickled. We watched them file  along, evidently making for lower ground on which to bed. Chub  snorted, and a large cow stopped and looked curiously in our  direction. Those behind passed leisurely around her. We knew she had  no calf, because she was light in color: cows suckling calves are of a  darker shade. A loud report seemed to rend the forest, and the beauty  dropped. The rest disappeared so suddenly that if the fine specimen  that lay before me had not been proof, it would almost have seemed a  dream. I had shot the cow elk my license called for.    We took off the head and removed the entrails, then covered our game  with pine boughs, to which we tied a red bandanna so as to make it  easy to find next day, when the men would come back with a saw to  divide it down the back and pack it in. There is an imposing row of  game hanging in the pines back of our tent. Supper was ready when we  got in. Mr. Haynes had been out also and was very joyful; he got his  elk this afternoon. We can start home day after to-morrow. It will  take the men all to-morrow to get in the game.    I shall be glad to start. I am getting homesick, and I have not had a  letter or even a card since I have been here. We are hungry for war  news, and besides, it is snowing again. Our clothes didn't get dry  either; they are frozen to the bush we hung them on. Perhaps they will  be snowed under by morning. I can't complain, though, for it is warm  and pleasant in our tent. The little camp-stove is glowing. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy is showing Jerrine how to make pigs of potatoes. Calvin  and Robert are asleep. The men have all gone to the bachelors' tent to  form their plans, all save Mr. Murry, who is \"serenading\" Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy. He is playing \"Nelly Gray,\" and somehow I don't want to  laugh at him as I usually do; I can only feel sorry for him.    I can hardly write because my heart is yearning for my little Junior  boy at home on the ranch with his grandmother. Dear little Mother  Stewart, I feel very tender toward her. Junior is the pride of her  heart. She would not allow us to bring him on this trip, so she is at  the ranch taking care of my brown-eyed boy. Every one is so good, so  kind, and I can do so little to repay. It makes me feel very unworthy.  You'll think I have the blues, but I haven't. I just feel humble and  chastened. When Mr. Murry pauses I can hear the soft spat, spat of the  falling snow on the tent. I will be powerfully glad when we set our  faces homeward.    Good-night, dear friend. Angels guard you.

This being       so, as I am anxious to put on record, I cannot reflect without       consternation that I should have been so given up by God to my own       intemperance as to shut my eyes on all these benefits; that,       instead of modest and respectful gratitude, I should indulge for       three weeks in continual moroseness towards all your family, in       headlong passion and the utmost insolence towards yourself, who       possess so many claims on my veneration, from your noble family,       your extraordinary learning, and distinguished reputation. Whatever       I have said or written against the person, the fame, the honour,       and the learning of your excellency; or whatever, in any other way,       I have injuriously spoken or written (if they admit no other more       favourable interpretation), as, to my grief, I have spoken and       written many things, and more than I can remember; all and       everything I recant, and freely and honestly declare and profess to       be groundless, false, and incapable of proof.\"    Tycho accepted the apology thus heartily rendered, and the temporary  breach was permanently healed.    In 1601, Kepler was appointed \"Imperial mathematician,\" to assist Tycho  in his calculations.    The Emperor Rudolph did a good piece of work in thus maintaining these  two eminent men, but it is quite clear that it was as astrologers that  he valued them; and all he cared for in the planetary motions was  limited to their supposed effect on his own and his kingdom's destiny.  He seems to have been politically a weak and superstitious prince, who  was letting his kingdom get into hopeless confusion, and entangling  himself in all manner of political complications. While Bohemia  suffered, however, the world has benefited at his hands; and the tables  upon which Tycho was now engaged are well called the Rudolphine tables.    These tables of planetary motion Tycho had always regarded as the main  work of his life; but he died before they were finished, and on his  death-bed he intrusted the completion of them to Kepler, who loyally  undertook their charge.    The Imperial funds were by this time, however, so taxed by wars and  other difficulties that the tables could only be proceeded with very  slowly, a staff of calculators being out of the question. In fact,  Kepler could not get even his own salary paid: he got orders, and  promises, and drafts on estates for it; but when the time came for them  to be honoured they were worthless, and he had no power to enforce his  claims.    So everything but brooding had to be abandoned as too expensive, and he  proceeded to study optics. He gave a very accurate explanation of the  action of the human eye, and made many hypotheses, some of them shrewd  and close to the mark, concerning the law of refraction of light in  dense media: but though several minor points of interest turned up,  nothing of the first magnitude came out of this long research.    The true law of refraction was discovered some years after by a Dutch  professor, Willebrod Snell.    We must now devote a little time to the main work of Kepler's life. All  the time he had been at Prague he had been making a severe study of the  motion of the planet Mars, analyzing minutely Tycho's books of  observations, in order to find out, if possible, the true theory of his  motion. Aristotle had taught that circular motion was the only perfect  and natural motion, and that the heavenly bodies therefore necessarily  moved in circles.    So firmly had this idea become rooted in men's minds, that no one ever  seems to have contemplated the possibility of its being false or  meaningless.    When Hipparchus and others found that, as a matter of fact, the planets  did _not_ revolve in simple circles, they did not try other curves, as  we should at once do now, but they tried combinations of circles, as we  saw in Lecture I. The small circle carried by a bigger one was called an  Epicycle. The carrying circle was called the Deferent. If for any reason  the earth had to be placed out of the centre, the main planetary orbit  was called an Excentric, and so on.    But although the planetary paths might be roughly represented by a  combination of circles, their speeds could not, on the hypothesis of  uniform motion in each circle round the earth as a fixed body. Hence was  introduced the idea of an Equant, _i.e._ an arbitrary point, not the  earth, about which the speed might be uniform. Copernicus, by making the  sun the centre, had been able to simplify a good deal of this, and to  abolish the equant.    But now that Kepler had the accurate observations of Tycho to refer to,  he found immense difficulty in obtaining the true positions of the  planets for long together on any such theory.    He specially attacked the motion of the planet Mars, because that was  sufficiently rapid in its changes for a considerable collection of data  to have accumulated with respect to it. He tried all manner of circular  orbits for the earth and for Mars, placing them in all sorts of aspects  with respect to the sun. The problem to be solved was to choose such an  orbit and such a law of speed, for both the earth and Mars, that a line  joining them, produced out to the stars, should always mark correctly  the apparent position of Mars as seen from the earth. He had to arrange  the size of the orbits that suited best, then the positions of their  centres, both being supposed excentric with respect to the sun; but he  could not get any such arrangement to work with uniform motion about the  sun. So he reintroduced the equant, and thus had another variable at his  disposal--in fact, two, for he had an equant for the earth and another  for Mars, getting a pattern of the kind suggested in Fig. 29.    The equants might divide the line in any arbitrary ratio. All sorts of  combinations had to be tried, the relative positions of the earth and  Mars to be worked out for each, and compared with Tycho's recorded  observations. It was easy to get them to agree for a short time, but  sooner or later a discrepancy showed itself.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--_S_ represents the sun; _EC_, the centre of the  earth's orbit, to be placed as best suited; _MC_, the same for Mars;  _EE_, the earth's equant, or point about which the earth uniformly  revolved (_i.e._ the point determining the law of speed about the sun),  likewise to be placed anywhere, but supposed to be in the line joining  _S_ to _EC_; _ME_, the same thing for Mars; with _?ME_ for an  alternative hypothesis that perhaps Mars' equant was on line joining  _EC_ with _MC_.]    I need not say that all these attempts and gropings, thus briefly  summarized, entailed enormous labour, and required not only great  pertinacity, but a most singularly constituted mind, that could thus  continue groping in the dark without a possible ray of theory to  illuminate its search. Grope he did, however, with unexampled diligence.    At length he hit upon a point that seemed nearly right. He thought he  had found the truth; but no, before long the position of the planet, as  calculated, and as recorded by Tycho, differed by eight minutes of arc,  or about one-eighth of a degree. Could the observation be wrong by this  small amount? No, he had known Tycho, and knew that he was never wrong  eight minutes in an observation.    So he set out the whole weary way again, and said that with those eight  minutes he would yet find out the law of the universe. He proceeded to  see if by making the planet librate, or the plane of its orbit tilt up  and down, anything could be done. He was rewarded by finding that at any  rate the plane of the orbit did not tilt up and down: it was fixed, and  this was a simplification on Copernicus's theory. It is not an absolute  fixture, but the changes are very small (see Laplace, page 266).    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Excentric circle supposed to be divided into  equal areas. The sun, _S_, being placed at a selected point, it was  possible to represent the varying speed of a planet by saying that it  moved from _A_ to _B_, from _B_ to _C_, and so on, in equal times.]    At last he thought of giving up the idea of _uniform_ circular motion,  and of trying _varying_ circular motion, say inversely as its distance  from the sun. To simplify calculation, he divided the orbit into  triangles, and tried if making the triangles equal would do. A great  piece of luck, they did beautifully: the rate of description of areas  (not arcs) is uniform. Over this discovery he greatly rejoices. He feels  as though he had been carrying on a war against the planet and had  triumphed; but his gratulation was premature. Before long fresh little  errors appeared, and grew in importance. Thus he announces it himself:--    \"While thus triumphing over Mars, and preparing for him, as for one  already vanquished, tabular prisons and equated excentric fetters, it is  buzzed here and there that the victory is vain, and that the war is  raging anew as violently as before. For the enemy left at home a  despised captive has burst all the chains of the equations, and broken  forth from the prisons of the tables.\"    Still, a part of the truth had been gained, and was not to be abandoned  any more. The law of speed was fixed: that which is now known as his  second law. But what about the shape of the orbit--Was it after all  possible that Aristotle, and every philosopher since Aristotle, had been  wrong? that circular motion was not the perfect and natural motion, but  that planets might move in some other closed curve?    Suppose he tried an oval. Well, there are a great variety of"]]]
