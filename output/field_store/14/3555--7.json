Why should he invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well  invite him. We are each paying for ourselves.\"    Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was  launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.    \"If that is so, dear--if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.  Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I  foresee a sad kettle of fish.\"    \"How?\"    \"Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.\"    \"That will mean another carriage.\"    \"Far worse. Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor. She knows it herself. The  truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.\"    They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank. Lucy stood by  the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer,  or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. The  well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic  city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things. Murder,  accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to  another--were these the daily incidents of her streets? Was there more  in her frank beauty than met the eye--the power, perhaps, to evoke  passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?    Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not  matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with  admirable delicacy \"where things might lead to,\" but apparently lost  sight of the goal as she approached it. Now she was crouching in the  corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag  which hung in chaste concealment round her neck. She had been told that  this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only  be broached within the walls of the English bank. As she groped she  murmured: \"Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager, or Mr.  Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave  Eleanor out altogether--which they could scarcely do--but in any case  we must be prepared. It is you they really want; I am only asked for  appearances. You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will  follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how difficult  it is!\"    \"It is indeed,\" replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded  sympathetic.    \"What do you think about it?\" asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the  struggle, and buttoning up her dress.    \"I don't know what I think, nor what I want.\"    \"Oh, dear, Lucy! I do hope Florence isn't boring you. Speak the word,  and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.\"    \"Thank you, Charlotte,\" said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.    There were letters for her at the bureau--one from her brother, full  of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her  mother's letters could be. She had read in it of the crocuses which had  been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid,  who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached  cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir  Harry Otway. She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she  was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.  The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view  over the Sussex Weald--all hung before her bright and distinct, but  pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a  traveller returns.    \"And the news?\" asked Miss Bartlett.    \"Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,\" said Lucy, giving the news  that interested her least. \"Do you know the Vyses?\"    \"Oh, not that way back. We can never have too much of the dear Piazza  Signoria.\"    \"They're nice people, the Vyses. So clever--my idea of what's really  clever. Don't you long to be in Rome?\"    \"I die for it!\"    The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant. It has no grass,  no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting  patches of ruddy brick. By an odd chance--unless we believe in a  presiding genius of places--the statues that relieve its severity  suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment  of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity. Perseus and  Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something,  and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after  experience, not before. Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might  a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.    \"Charlotte!\" cried the girl suddenly. \"Here's an idea. What if we popped  off to Rome to-morrow--straight to the Vyses' hotel? For I do know what  I want. I'm sick of Florence. No, you said you'd go to the ends of the  earth! Do! Do!\"    Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:    \"Oh, you droll person! Pray, what would become of your drive in the  hills?\"    They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing  over the unpractical suggestion.        Chapter VI: The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager,  Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte  Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a  View; Italians Drive Them.    It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth  all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master's horses up  the stony hill. Mr. Beebe recognized him at once. Neither the Ages of  Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany  driving a cab. And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on  the way, saying that she was his sister--Persephone, tall and slender  and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother's cottage, and still  shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light. To her Mr. Eager objected,  saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard  against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made  clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount  beside the god.    Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling  himself to drive with his arm round her waist. She did not mind.  Mr. Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the  indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy. The  other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss  Lavish. For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting  Mr. Eager, had doubled the size of the party. And though Miss Bartlett  and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,  at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their  heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with  George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.    It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carree thus  transformed. Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,  was now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about  them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. But a shoddy  lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of  God--they should enter no villa at his introduction.    Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these  explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr. Eager, repressive towards Miss  Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks  to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring. She looked on the  expedition as the work of Fate. But for it she would have avoided George  Emerson successfully. In an open manner he had shown that he wished to  continue their intimacy. She had refused, not because she disliked him,  but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he  did know. And this frightened her.    For the real event--whatever it was--had taken place, not in the Loggia,  but by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.  But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence,  and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled  emotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something blameworthy  (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the  common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of  a look or word. This sense of wickedness had been slight at first. She  had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo. But each time that  she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid  him again. And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two  clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this  expedition with him through the hills.    Meanwhile Mr. Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was  over.    \"So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?\"    \"Oh, dear me, no--oh, no!\"    \"Perhaps as a student of human nature,\" interposed Miss Lavish, \"like  myself?\"    \"Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.\"    \"Oh, indeed,\" said Mr. Eager. \"Are you indeed? If you will not think me  rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little--handed  about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to  Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious  of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get 'done'  or 'through' and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up towns,  rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American girl  in Punch who says: 'Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?' And the father  replies: 'Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.'  There's travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!\"    \"I quite agree,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#11)"],[1,"of comb, containing the brood of workers, reserving power to  destroy the young brood when necessary. This plan succeeded admirably.  The bees, in bestowing all their attention on these last worms, forgot  those that had been removed.    When the moment of transformation of the nymphs in the nineteen cells  arrived, I examined the grated box frequently every day, and at length  found six bees exactly similar to _common bees_. The worms of the  remaining thirteen had perished without changing.    The portion of brood comb that had been put into the hive to prevent the  discouragement of the bees was then removed. I put aside the queens  produced in the royal cells; and having painted the thorax of the six  bees red, and amputated the right antenna, I transferred the whole six  into the hive, where they were well received.    You easily conceive my object, Sir, in this course of observations. I  knew there was neither a large nor small queen in the hive: therefore,  if, in the sequel, I should find new laid eggs in the combs, how very  probable must it be that they had been produced by some of the six bees?  But, to attain absolute certainty, it was necessary to take them in the  act of laying. Some ineffaceable mark was also required for  distinguishing them in particular.    This proceeding was attended with the most ample success. We soon found  eggs in the hive; their number increased daily; and their worms were all  drones. But a long interval elapsed before we could take the bees that  laid them. At length, by means of assiduity and perseverance, we  perceived one introducing the posterior part into a cell; we opened the  hive, and caught the bee: We saw the egg it had deposited, and by the  colour of the thorax, and privation of the right antenna, instantly  recognised that it was one of the six that had passed to the vermicular  state in the vicinity of the royal cells.    I could no longer doubt the truth of my conjecture; at the same time, I  know not whether the truth will appear as rigorous to you, Sir, as it  does to myself. But I reason in the following manner: If it is certain  that fertile workers are always produced in the vicinity of royal cells,  it is no less true, that in itself, the vicinity is indifferent; for the  size and figure of these cells can produce no effect on the worms in  those surrounding them; there must be something more; we know that a  particular aliment is conveyed to the royal cells; we also know, that  this aliment has a very powerful effect on the ovaries; that it alone  can unfold the germ. Thus, we must necessarily suppose the worms in the  adjacent cells have had a portion of the same food. This is what they  gain, therefore, by vicinity to the royal cells. The bees, in their  course thither, will pass in numbers over them, stop and drop some  portion of the jelly destined for the royal larvae. This reasoning, I  presume, is consistent with the principles of sound logic.    I have repeated the experiment now described so often, and weighed all  the concomitant circumstances with so much care, that whenever I please,  I can produce fertile workers in my hives. The method is simple. I  remove the queen from a hive; and very soon the bees labour to replace  her, by enlarging several cells, containing the brood of workers, and  supplying the included worms with the royal jelly. Portions of this  aliment also fall on the young larvae deposited in the adjacent cells,  and it unfolds the ovaries to a certain degree. Fertile workers are  constantly produced in hives where the bees labour to replace their  queen; but we very rarely find them, because they are attacked and  destroyed by the young queens reared in the royal cells. Therefore, to  save them, all their enemies must be removed, and the larvae of the royal  cells taken away before undergoing their last metamorphoses. Then the  fertile workers, being without rivals at the time of their origin, will  be well received, and, by taking the precaution to mark them, it will be  seen, in a few days, that they produce the eggs of males. Thus, the  whole secret of this proceeding consists in removing the royal cells at  the proper time; that is, after being sealed, and previous to the young  queens leaving them{K}.    I shall add but a few words to this long letter. There is nothing so  very surprising in the production of fertile workers, when we consider  the consequences of M. Shirach's beautiful discovery. But why do they  lay male eggs only? I can conceive, indeed, that the reason of their  laying few is from their ovaries being but imperfectly expanded, but I  can form no idea why all the eggs should be those of males, neither can  I any better account for their use in hives; and hitherto, I have made  no experiments on their mode of fecundation.      _PREGNY, 25. August 1791._      FOOTNOTES:    {I} It is difficult to discover whether the author thinks, as some  naturalists, that bees are instrumental in hatching the eggs.--T.    {J} The original is extremely confused in the preceding passages.--T.    {K} I have frequently seen queens, at the moment of production, begin  first by attacking the royal cells and then the common ones beside them.  As I had not seen fertile workers when I first observed this fact, I  could not conceive from what motive the fury of the queen was thus  directed towards the common cells. But now I know they can distinguish  the species included, and have the same instinctive jealousy or aversion  towards them as against the nymphs of queens properly so denominated.          LETTER VI.    _ON THE COMBATS OF QUEENS: THE MASSACRE OF THE MALES: AND WHAT SUCCEEDS  IN A HIVE WHERE A STRANGER QUEEN IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE NATURAL ONE._      M. de Reaumur had not witnessed every thing relative to bees when he  composed his history of these industrious animals. Several observers,  and those of Lusace in particular, have discovered many important facts  that escaped him; and I, in my turn, have made various observations of  which he had no suspicion: at the same time, and this is a very  remarkable circumstance, not only has all that he expressly declares he  saw been verified by succeeding naturalists, but all his conjectures are  found just. The German naturalists, Schirach, Hattorf, and Riems  sometimes contradict him, indeed, in their memoirs; but I can maintain  that, while combating the opinion of M. de Reaumur, it is they who are  almost always wrong; of which several instances might be adduced.    What I shall now proceed to say will give me an opportunity of detailing  some interesting facts.    It was observed by M. de Reaumur, that when any supernumerary queen is  either produced in a hive, or comes into it, one of the two soon  perishes. He has not actually witnessed the combat in which she falls,  but he conjectures there is a mutual attack, and that the empire remains  with the strongest or the most fortunate. M. Schirach, on the other  hand, and, after him, M. Riems, thinks that the working bees assail the  stranger, and sting her to death. I cannot comprehend by what means they  have been able to make this observation: as they used very thick hives  only, with several rows of combs, they could at most but observe the  commencement of hostilities. While the combat lasts, the bees move with  great rapidity; they fly on all sides; and, gliding between the combs,  conceal their motions from the observer. For my part, though using the  most favourable hives, I have never seen a combat between the queens and  workers, but I have very often beheld one between the queens themselves.    In one of my hives in particular, there were five or six royal cells,  each including a nymph. The eldest first underwent its transformation.  Scarcely did ten minutes elapse from the time of this young queen  leaving her cradle, when she visited the other royal cells still close.  She furiously attacked the nearest; and, by dint of labour, succeeded  in opening the top: we saw her tearing the silk of the coccoon with her  teeth; but her efforts were probably inadequate to the object, for she  abandoned this end of the cell, and began at the other, where she  accomplished a larger aperture. When it was sufficiently enlarged, she  endeavoured to introduce her belly, and made many exertions until she  succeeded in giving her rival a deadly wound with her sting. Then having  left the cell, all the bees that had hitherto been spectators of her  labour, began to increase the opening, and drew out the dead body of a  queen scarcely come from its envelope of a nymph.    Meanwhile, the victorious young queen attacked another royal cell, but  did not endeavour to introduce her extremity into it. There was only a  royal nymph, and no queen, come to maturity, as in the first cell. In  all probability, nymphs of queens inspire their rivals with less  animosity; still they do not escape destruction: because, whenever a  royal cell has been opened before the proper time, the bees extract the  contents in whatever form they may be, whether worm, nymph, or queen.  Lastly, the young queen attacked the third cell, but could not succeed  in penetrating it. She laboured languidly, and appeared as if exhausted  by her first exertions. As we now required queens for some particular  experiments, we resolved to remove the other royal cells, yet in safety,  to secure them from her fury.    After this observation, we wished to see what ensued on two queens  leaving their cells at the same time, and in what manner one perished. I  find an observation on this head in my Journal, 15. May 1790.    In one of our thinnest hives, two queens left their cells almost at the  same moment. Whenever they observed each other, they rushed together,  apparently with great fury, and were in such a position that the antennae  of each was seized by the teeth of the other: the head, breast, and  belly of the one were exposed to the head, breast, and belly "]]]
