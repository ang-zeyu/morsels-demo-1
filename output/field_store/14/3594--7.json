But the post of assistant in Schroeter's observatory  at Lilienthal having become vacant by the removal of Harding to  Gottingen in 1805, Olbers procured for him the offer of it. It was not  without a struggle that he resolved to exchange the desk for the  telescope. His reputation with his employers was of the highest; he had  thoroughly mastered the details of the business, which his keen  practical intelligence followed with lively interest; his years of  apprenticeship were on the point of expiring, and an immediate, and not  unwelcome prospect of comparative affluence lay before him. The love of  science, however, prevailed; he chose poverty and the stars, and went to  Lilienthal with a salary of a hundred thalers yearly. Looking back over  his life's work, Olbers long afterwards declared that the greatest  service which he had rendered to astronomy was that of having discerned,  directed, and promoted the genius of Bessel.[61]    For four years he continued in Schroeter's employment. At the end of that  time the Prussian Government chose him to superintend the erection of a  new observatory at Koenigsberg, which after many vexatious delays, caused  by the prostrate condition of the country, was finished towards the end  of 1813. Koenigsberg was the first really efficient German observatory.  It became, moreover, a centre of improvement, not for Germany alone, but  for the whole astronomical world. During two-and-thirty years it was the  scene of Bessel's labours, and Bessel's labours had for their aim the  reconstruction, on an amended and uniform plan, of the entire science of  observation.    A knowledge of the places of the stars is the foundation of  astronomy.[62] Their configuration lends to the skies their distinctive  features, and marks out the shifting tracks of more mobile objects with  relatively fixed, and generally unvarying points of light. A more  detailed and accurate acquaintance with the stellar multitude, regarded  from a purely uranographical point of view, has accordingly formed at  all times a primary object of celestial science, and was, during the  last century, cultivated with a zeal and success by which all previous  efforts were dwarfed into insignificance. In Lalande's _Histoire  Celeste_, published in 1801, the places of no less than 47,390 stars  were given, but in the rough, as it were, and consequently needing  laborious processes of calculation to render them available for exact  purposes. Piazzi set an example of improved methods of observation,  resulting in the publication, in 1803 and 1814, of two catalogues of  about 7,600 stars--the second being a revision and enlargement of the  first--which for their time were models of what such works should  be.[63] Stephen Groombridge at Blackheath was similarly and most  beneficially active. But something more was needed than the diligence of  individual observers. A systematic reform was called for; and it was  this which Bessel undertook and carried through.    Direct observation furnishes only what has been called the \"raw  material\" of the positions of the heavenly bodies.[64] A number of  highly complex corrections have to be applied before their _mean_ can be  disengaged from their _apparent_ places on the sphere. Of these, the  most considerable and familiar is atmospheric refraction, by which  objects seem to stand higher in the sky than they in reality do, the  effect being evanescent at the zenith, and attaining, by gradations  varying with conditions of pressure and temperature, a maximum at the  horizon. Moreover, the points to which measurements are referred are  themselves in motion, either continually in one direction, or  periodically to and fro. The _precession_ of the equinoxes is slowly  progressive, or rather retrogressive; the _nutation_ of the pole  oscillatory in a period of about eighteen years. Added to which, the  non-instantaneous transmission of light, combined with the movement of  the earth in its orbit, causes a small annual displacement known as  _aberration_.    Now it is easy to see that any uncertainty in the application of these  corrections saps the very foundations of exact astronomy. Extremely  minute quantities, it is true, are concerned; but the life and progress  of modern celestial science depends upon the sure recognition of  extremely minute quantities. In the early years of the nineteenth  century, however, no uniform system of \"reduction\" (so the complete  correction of observational results is termed) had been established.  Much was left to the individual caprice of observers, who selected for  the several \"elements\" of reduction such values as seemed best to  themselves. Hence arose much hurtful confusion, tending to hinder united  action and mar the usefulness of laborious researches. For this state of  things, Bessel, by the exercise of consummate diligence, sagacity, and  patience, provided an entirely satisfactory remedy.    His first step was an elaborate investigation of the precious series of  observations made by Bradley at Greenwich from 1750 until his death in  1762. The catalogue of 3,222 stars which he extracted from them gave the  earliest example of the systematic reduction on a uniform plan of such a  body of work. It is difficult, without entering into details out of  place in a volume like the present, to convey an idea of the arduous  nature of this task. It involved the formation of a theory of the errors  of each of Bradley's instruments, and a difficult and delicate inquiry  into the true value of each correction to be applied, before the entries  in the Greenwich journals could be developed into a finished and  authentic catalogue. Although completed in 1813, it was not until five  years later that the results appeared with the proud, but not  inappropriate title of _Fundamenta Astronomiae_. The eminent value of the  work consisted in this, that by providing a mass of entirely reliable  information as to the state of the heavens at the epoch 1755, it threw  back the beginning of _exact_ astronomy almost half a century. By  comparison with Piazzi's catalogues the amount of precession was more  accurately determined, the proper motions of a considerable number of  stars became known with certainty, and definite prediction--the  certificate of initiation into the secrets of Nature--at last became  possible as regards the places of the stars. Bessel's final improvements  in the methods of reduction were published in 1830 in his _Tabulae  Regiomontanae_. They not only constituted an advance in accuracy, but  afforded a vast increase of facility in application, and were at once  and everywhere adopted. Thus astronomy became a truly universal science;  uncertainties and disparities were banished, and observations made at  all times and places rendered mutually comparable.[65]    More, however, yet remained to be done. In order to verify with greater  strictness the results drawn from the Bradley and Piazzi catalogues, a  third term of comparison was wanted, and this Bessel undertook to  supply. By a course of 75,011 observations, executed during the years  1821-33, with the utmost nicety of care, the number of accurately known  stars was brought up to above 50,000, and an ample store of trustworthy  facts laid up for the use of future astronomers. In this department  Argelander, whom he attracted from finance to astronomy, and trained in  his own methods, was his assistant and successor. The great \"Bonn  Durchmusterung,\"[66] in which 324,198 stars visible in the northern  hemisphere are enumerated, and the corresponding \"Atlas\" published in  1857-63, constituting a picture of our sidereal surroundings of  heretofore unapproached completeness, may be justly said to owe their  origin to Bessel's initiative, and to form a sequel to what he  commenced.    But his activity was not solely occupied with the promotion of a  comprehensive reform in astronomy; it embraced special problems as well.  The long-baffled search for a parallax of the fixed stars was resumed  with fresh zeal as each mechanical or optical improvement held out fresh  hopes of a successful issue. Illusory results abounded. Piazza in 1805  perceived, as he supposed, considerable annual displacements in Vega,  Aldebaran, Sirius, and Procyon; the truth being that his instruments  were worn out with constant use, and could no longer be depended  upon.[67] His countryman, Calandrelli, was similarly deluded. The  celebrated controversy between the Astronomer Royal and Dr. Brinkley,  Director of the Dublin College Observatory, turned on the same subject.  Brinkley, who was in possession of a first-rate meridian-circle,  believed himself to have discovered relatively large parallaxes for four  of the brightest stars; Pond, relying on the testimony of the Greenwich  instruments, asserted their nullity. The dispute, protracted for  fourteen years, from 1810 until 1824, was brought to no definite  conclusion; but the strong presumption on the negative side was  abundantly justified in the event.    There was good reason for incredulity in the matter of parallaxes.  Announcements of their detection had become so frequent as to be  discredited before they were disproved; and Struve, who investigated the  subject at Dorpat in 1818-21, had clearly shown that the quantities  concerned were too small to come within the reliable measuring powers of  any instrument then in use. Already, however, the means were being  prepared of giving to those powers a large increase.    On the 21st July, 1801, two old houses in an alley of Munich tumbled  down, burying in their ruins the occupants, of whom one alone was  extricated alive, though seriously injured. This was an orphan lad of  fourteen named Joseph Fraunhofer. The Elector Maximilian Joseph was  witness of the scene, became interested in the"]]]
