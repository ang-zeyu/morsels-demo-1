Again they are  _pen'ni-form_, converging, like the plumes of a pen, to one side of a  tendon, which runs the whole length of the muscle; or they are  _bi-pen'ni-form_, converging to both sides of the tendon.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How are tendons or cords formed? What is the expansion of a tendon  called? How can the structure of muscles and their fibres be shown?  What does fig. 36 represent? 152. Give the different arrangements of  muscular fibres.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    153. In the description of a muscle, its attachments are expressed by  the terms \"origin\" and \"insertion.\" The term _origin_ is generally  applied to the more fixed or central attachment, or to the point  toward which motion is directed; while _insertion_ is assigned to the  more movable point, or to that most distant from the centre. The  middle, fleshy portion is called the \"belly,\" or \"swell.\" The color of  a muscle is red in warm-blooded fish and animals; and each fibre is  supplied with arteries, veins, lymphatics, and both sensitive and  motor nervous filaments.    154. The FASCIA is of various extent and thickness, distributed  through the different regions of the body, for the purpose of  investing and protecting the softer and more delicate organs. An  instance is seen in the membrane which envelopes a leg of beef, and  which is observed on the edges of the slices when it is cut for  broiling. When freshly exposed, it is brilliant in appearance, tough,  and inelastic. In the limbs it forms distinct sheaths to all the  muscles.    155. This tendinous membrane assists the muscles in their action, by  keeping up a tonic pressure on their surface. It aids materially in  the circulation of the fluids, in opposition to the laws of gravity.  In the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, it is a powerful  protection to the structures that enter into the formation of these  parts. In all parts of the system, the separate muscles are not only  invested by fascia, but they are arranged in layers, one over  another. The sheath of each muscle is loosely connected with another,  by the cellular membrane.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    153. What is meant by the origin of a muscle? The insertion? The  swell? What is the color of muscles? With what is each muscular fibre  supplied? 154. What is said of fascia? What is its appearance when  freshly exposed? 155. What effect has it on the muscles? Give other  uses of the fascia.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    156. The interstices between the different muscles are filled with  adipose matter, or fat. This is sometimes called the packing of the  system. To the presence of this tissue, youth are indebted for the  roundness and beauty of their limbs.    [Illustration: Fig. 37. A transverse section of the neck. The separate  muscles, as they are arranged in layers, with their investing fasciae, are  beautifully represented. As the system is symmetrical, figures are placed  only on one side. In the trunk the muscles are arranged in layers,  surrounded by fasciae, as in the neck. The same is true of the muscles of  the upper and lower limbs.    12, The trachea, (windpipe.) 13, The oesophagus, (gullet.) 14, The  carotid artery and jugular vein. 28, One of the bones of the spinal  column.

The muscles may be arranged, in conformity with the general  division of the body, into four parts: 1st. Those of the _Head_  and _Neck_. 2d. Those of the _Trunk_. 3d. Those of the _Upper  Extremities_. 4th. Those of the _Lower Extremities_.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    156. Give a reason why the limbs of youth are rounder than those of  the aged.

The  muscle 2 closes the eye. The muscle 6 elevates the upper lip. The muscles  7, 8, 9, elevate the angle of the mouth. The muscle 10 brings the teeth  together when eating. The muscle 11 depresses the upper lip. The muscle  13 closes the mouth. The muscle 15 depresses the angle of the mouth. The  muscle 16 draws down the lower lip. The muscles 18, 19, 20, 23, depress  the lower jaw and larynx and elevate the sternum. The muscle 21, when  both sides contract, draws the head forward, or elevates the sternum;  when only one contracts, the face is turned one side toward the opposite  shoulder. The muscles 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, aid in respiration.]       [5] In the plates illustrating the muscular system, the names of such         muscles are given as are referred to in the paragraph         \"Practical Explanation.\" These names need not be committed to         memory. If a pupil wishes to acquire a knowledge of the general         attachment of the muscles represented in the plates, he can do         so by _comparing_ the muscular plate with that of the skeleton,         (fig. 28.)    _Observation._ When we are sick, and cannot take food, the body is  sustained by absorption of the fat. The removal of it into the blood  causes the sunken cheek, hollow eye, and prominent appearance of the  bones after a severe illness.    158. The number of muscles in the human body is more than five  hundred; in general, they form about the skeleton two layers, and are  distinguished into superficial and deep-seated muscles. Some of the  muscles are voluntary in their motions, or act under the government of  the will, as those which move the fingers, limbs, and trunk; while  others are involuntary, or act under the impression of their proper  stimulants, without the control of the individual, as the heart.    _Observations._ 1st. The abdominal muscles are expiratory, and the  chief agents for expelling the residuum from the rectum, the bile from  the gall bladder, the contents of the stomach and bowels when  vomiting, and the mucus and irritating substances from the bronchial  tubes, trachea, and nasal passages by coughing and sneezing. To  produce these effects they all act together. Their violent and  continued action sometimes produces hernia, and, when spasmodic, may  occasion ruptures of the different organs.    2d. The contraction and relaxation of the abdominal muscles and  diaphragm stimulate the stomach, liver, and intestines to a healthy  action, and are subservient to the digestive powers. If the  contractility of their muscular fibres is destroyed or impaired, the  tone of the digestive apparatus will be diminished, as in indigestion  and costiveness. This is frequently attended by a displacement of  those organs, as they generally gravitate towards the lower portion of  the abdominal cavity, when the sustaining muscles lose their tone and  become relaxed.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What causes the hollow eye and sunken cheek after a severe sickness?  158.

The muscle 2  elevates the arm. The muscle 6 elevates the ribs when the scapula is  fixed, or draws the scapula forward and downward when the ribs are fixed.  The muscles 12, 16, 18, bend the body forward or elevate the hips when  the muscles of both sides act. They likewise depress the rib in  expiration. When the muscles on only one side act, the body is twisted to  the same side.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Explain fig. 39.

They likewise depress  the ribs in respiration. The transverse muscle, 6, 7, 8, lessens the  cavity of the abdomen, and presses the intestines; stomach, and liver  upward, against the diaphragm, in expiration.]    3d.

But if my speech be hampered, or mine  eyes stray, is it not because my mind is confused by thy beauty, and the  honey of kind words which floweth from thy mouth?\"    She laughed outright at his word, but not disdainfully, and said: \"This  is well spoken, Squire, and even what a squire should say to his liege  lady, when the sun is up on a fair morning, and she and he and all the  world are glad.\"    She stood quite near him as she spoke, her hand was on his shoulder, and  her eyes shone and sparkled.  Sooth to say, that excusing of his  confusion was like enough in seeming to the truth; for sure never  creature was fashioned fairer than she: clad she was for the greenwood as  the hunting-goddess of the Gentiles, with her green gown gathered unto  her girdle, and sandals on her feet; a bow in her hand and a quiver at  her back: she was taller and bigger of fashion than the dear Maiden,  whiter of flesh, and more glorious, and brighter of hair; as a flower of  flowers for fairness and fragrance.    She said: \"Thou art verily a fair squire before the hunt is up, and if  thou be as good in the hunting, all will be better than well, and the  guest will be welcome.  But lo! here cometh our Maid with the good grey  ones.  Go meet her, and we will tarry no longer than for thy taking the  leash in hand.\"    So Walter looked, and saw the Maid coming with two couple of great hounds  in the leash straining against her as she came along.  He ran lightly to  meet her, wondering if he should have a look, or a half-whisper from her;  but she let him take the white thongs from her hand, with the same half-  smile of shamefacedness still set on her face, and, going past him, came  softly up to the Lady, swaying like a willow-branch in the wind, and  stood before her, with her arms hanging down by her sides.  Then the Lady  turned to her, and said: \"Look to thyself, our Maid, while we are away.  This fair young man thou needest not to fear indeed, for he is good and  leal; but what thou shalt do with the King's Son I wot not.  He is a hot  lover forsooth, but a hard man; and whiles evil is his mood, and perilous  both to thee and me.  And if thou do his will, it shall be ill for thee;  and if thou do it not, take heed of him, and let me, and me only, come  between his wrath and thee.  I may do somewhat for thee.  Even yesterday  he was instant with me to have thee chastised after the manner of  thralls; but I bade him keep silence of such words, and jeered him and  mocked him, till he went away from me peevish and in anger.  So look to  it that thou fall not into any trap of his contrivance.\"    Then the Maid cast herself at the Mistress's feet, and kissed and  embraced them; and as she rose up, the Lady laid her hand lightly on her  head, and then, turning to Walter, cried out: \"Now, Squire, let us leave  all these troubles and wiles and desires behind us, and flit through the  merry greenwood like the Gentiles of old days.\"    And therewith she drew up the laps of her gown till the whiteness of her  knees was seen, and set off swiftly toward the wood that lay south of the  house, and Walter followed, marvelling at her goodliness; nor durst he  cast a look backward to the Maiden, for he knew that she desired him, and  it was her only that he looked to for his deliverance from this house of  guile and lies.          CHAPTER XIV: THE HUNTING OF THE HART      As they went, they found a change in the land, which grew emptier of big  and wide-spreading trees, and more beset with thickets.  From one of  these they roused a hart, and Walter let slip his hounds thereafter and  he and the Lady followed running.  Exceeding swift was she, and  well-breathed withal, so that Walter wondered at her; and eager she was  in the chase as the very hounds, heeding nothing the scratching of briars  or the whipping of stiff twigs as she sped on.  But for all their eager  hunting, the quarry outran both dogs and folk, and gat him into a great  thicket, amidmost whereof was a wide plash of water.  Into the thicket  they followed him, but he took to the water under their eyes and made  land on the other side; and because of the tangle of underwood, he swam  across much faster than they might have any hope to come round on him;  and so were the hunters left undone for that time.    So the Lady cast herself down on the green grass anigh the water, while  Walter blew the hounds in and coupled them up; then he turned round to  her, and lo! she was weeping for despite that they had lost the quarry;  and again did Walter wonder that so little a matter should raise a  passion of tears in her.  He durst not ask what ailed her, or proffer her  solace, but was not ill apaid by beholding her loveliness as she lay.    Presently she raised up her head and turned to Walter, and spake to him  angrily and said: \"Squire, why dost thou stand staring at me like a  fool?\"    \"Yea, Lady,\" he said; \"but the sight of thee maketh me foolish to do  aught else but to look on thee.\"    She said, in a peevish voice: \"Tush, Squire, the day is too far spent for  soft and courtly speeches; what was good there is nought so good here.  Withal, I know more of thine heart than thou deemest.\"    Walter hung down his head and reddened, and she looked on him, and her  face changed, and she smiled and said, kindly this time: \"Look ye,  Squire, I am hot and weary, and ill-content; but presently it will be  better with me; for my knees have been telling my shoulders that the cold  water of this little lake will be sweet and pleasant this summer noonday,  and that I shall forget my foil when I have taken my pleasure therein.  Wherefore, go thou with thine hounds without the thicket and there abide  my coming.  And I bid thee look not aback as thou goest, for therein were  peril to thee: I shall not keep thee tarrying long alone.\"    He bowed his head to her, and turned and went his ways.  And now, when he  was a little space away from her, he deemed her indeed a marvel of women,  and wellnigh forgat all his doubts and fears concerning her, whether she  were a fair image fashioned out of lies and guile, or it might be but an  evil thing in the shape of a goodly woman.  Forsooth, when he saw her  caressing the dear and friendly Maid, his heart all turned against her,  despite what his eyes and his ears told his mind, and she seemed like as  it were a serpent enfolding the simplicity of the body which he loved.    But now it was all changed, and he lay on the grass and longed for her  coming; which was delayed for somewhat more than an hour.  Then she came  back to him, smiling and fresh and cheerful, her green gown let down to  her heels.    He sprang up to meet her, and she came close to him, and spake from a  laughing face: \"Squire, hast thou no meat in thy wallet?  For, meseemeth,  I fed thee when thou wert hungry the other day; do thou now the same by  me.\"    He smiled, and louted to her, and took his wallet and brought out thence  bread and flesh and wine, and spread them all out before her on the green  grass, and then stood by humbly before her.  But she said: \"Nay, my  Squire, sit down by me and eat with me, for to-day are we both hunters  together.\"    So he sat down by her trembling, but neither for awe of her greatness,  nor for fear and horror of her guile and sorcery.    A while they sat there together after they had done their meat, and the  Lady fell a-talking with Walter concerning the parts of the earth, and  the manners of men, and of his journeyings to and fro.    At last she said: \"Thou hast told me much and answered all my questions  wisely, and as my good Squire should, and that pleaseth me.  But now tell  me of the city wherein thou wert born and bred; a city whereof thou hast  hitherto told me nought.\"    \"Lady,\" he said, \"it is a fair and a great city, and to many it seemeth  lovely.  But I have left it, and now it is nothing to me.\"    \"Hast thou not kindred there?\" said she.    \"Yea,\" said he, \"and foemen withal; and a false woman waylayeth my life  there.\"    \"And what was she?\" said the Lady.    Said Walter: \"She was but my wife.\"    \"Was she fair?\" said the Lady.    Walter looked on her a while, and then said: \"I was going to say that she  was wellnigh as fair as thou; but that may scarce be.  Yet was she very  fair.  But now, kind and gracious Lady, I will say this word to thee: I  marvel that thou askest so many things concerning the city of Langton on  Holm, where I was born, and where are my kindred yet; for meseemeth that  thou knowest it thyself.\"    \"I know it, I?\" said the Lady.    \"What, then! thou knowest it not?\" said Walter.    Spake the Lady, and some of her old disdain was in her words: \"Dost thou  deem that I wander about the world and its cheaping-steads like one of  the chap-men?  Nay, I dwell in the Wood beyond the World, and nowhere  else.  What hath put this word into thy mouth?\"    He said: \"Pardon me, Lady, if I have misdone; but thus it was: Mine own  eyes beheld thee going down the quays of our city, and thence a  ship-board, and the ship sailed out of the haven.  And first of all went  a strange dwarf, whom I have seen here, and then thy Maid; and then went  thy gracious and lovely body.\"    The Lady's face changed as he spoke, and she turned red and then pale,  and set her teeth; but"]]]
