You will see it on plate V, No.  10. Please sing a low tone; place your finger gently on the shield, and  move it downwards. You will soon discover a little hollow which  corresponds with the opening I just mentioned, and into which you can  easily put part of the tip of your finger. Now sing up the scale, and  take care to keep the tip of your finger in the hollow. Remember that in  singing up the scale your voicebox will rise, which movement you must  follow, or you will lose the place. If you do this carefully, you will  find that the hollow gets smaller and smaller by degrees until at last  it closes entirely, and you can no longer find a trace of it. Now sing  down again, keeping your finger on the same spot. You will soon notice  the hollow again, and it will continue to get larger and larger until  you arrive at the bottom of your scale.    This, of course, is but another way of showing the mechanism by which  the pitch of your tones is raised or lowered, and we have proved the  same thing by our preceding experiment. But I asked you to try this  chiefly because it will enable you to put a check upon my statements  with regard to the registers of the voice, a subject which I propose to  discuss in another chapter.          THE LARYNGOSCOPE, AND HOW TO USE IT.      The Laryngoscope in its simplest form is a thin circular mirror, about  three-quarters of an inch in diameter, set in a metal frame, and  fastened at an angle of 120 deg. to a piece of wire from three to four  inches long, which is put into a small wooden handle not much thicker  than a pencil, and about the same length as the wire. By help of the  laryngoscope we can either see our own larynx or that of another person.  The easiest experiment is upon the larynx of some one else. In this  case, the person to be operated upon sits facing the sun, the head  slightly bent backwards, and the mouth wide open. If he has not  sufficient control over his tongue to prevent it from arching up, he  must gently hold its protruding tip with a pocket handkerchief between  his thumb and forefinger. The mirror is now slightly warmed to prevent  its becoming dimmed by the moisture of the breath, and then, holding it  like a pen, the operator introduces it into the throat so that it  touches the uvula. This must be done lightly yet firmly, care being  taken not to bring the mirror into contact with the base of the tongue.  The rays of the sun falling upon the mirror are reflected downwards into  the voicebox, the image of which is clearly visible in the mirror. In  making observations upon oneself, a second mirror in the shape of an  ordinary hand looking-glass is necessary to reproduce the image in the  small mirror. This is the way in which the renowned professor of  singing, Senor Manuel Garcia, made those famous \"Observations on the  Human Voice,\" communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. Sharpey, on May  the 24th, 1855. Similar attempts had been made before; for instance, in  1827 by Babington, in 1838 by Baumes, in 1840 by Liston, and in 1844 by  Warden and Avery. But they had all ended in failure, an occasional  glimpse of some parts of the voicebox being the only result obtained.  Garcia, however, brilliantly succeeded where all his predecessors had  failed, and was the first not only to see the vocal ligaments, but to  see them in the act of singing, and to see them so clearly as to be able  to give an account of their minutest movements. The instrument has since  been greatly improved, and the process of investigation has become a  science. Medical men all over the world have laid hold of it, and  suffering humanity is daily benefited by it. But Garcia is the man who  produced the first results, and to him, therefore, is due the credit of  being practically the inventor of the laryngoscope.    It is almost incredible, but it is true, that this splendid invention  was received coldly and with distrust in this country, and had it not  been for Dr. Johann N. Czermak, Professor of Physiology at the  University of Pesth, the matter would, in all probability, have been  forgotten. But this gentleman recognized the value of Garcia's  invention, and he at once went enthusiastically to work, and pushed on  vigorously in the way which Garcia had opened for him. He constructed an  apparatus which enabled him, by making use of artificial light, to work  without interruption and without waiting for the sun to shine. He then  made his first attempts on himself in order to become acquainted with  the conditions which have to be fulfilled by the observer as well as by  the person to be operated upon. In this way he soon became a master of  the new process, which he immediately brought under the notice of the  profession by giving lectures and demonstrations in the chief towns of  Europe.    More than twenty years have passed since then, and the laryngoscope has,  during that time, been made excellent use of, not only for the  alleviation of suffering, and the cure of disease, but also for its  original purpose--_i.e._, the exploration of the mechanism of the human  voice.    My own connection with the matter has arisen through my desire to sift  contradictory statements made by various observers. Having read many  English, German, and French books on the subject, I was in position to  pick up a hint here, and to get some good advice there, and the  consequence was that I was able to pursue a course which made me  familiar with the use of the laryngoscope in a very short time. As my  experience may be useful to others, I will briefly relate how I  proceeded.    I made my first attempts upon a skull, to which I attached a  plaster-of-Paris model of the voicebox, the whole being fastened to an  iron stand. The instrument I used was a concave reflector on a spectacle  frame. The reflector had a hole in the centre, and was capable of being  moved in various directions. The next thing was the little mirror  described on page 73, and lastly, a gas lamp on the principle of the  well-known \"Queen's\" reading lamps, which can be raised or lowered at  pleasure. I placed the skull to the left of the lamp, and looking with  my right eye through the hole in the centre of the reflector, practised  throwing the light swiftly and with certainty into the upper part of the  throat. I then introduced the little spy mirror, and tried to see and to  recognize the various parts of the voicebox, which, let it be  remembered, present a somewhat different appearance in the looking-glass  from what they do if seen without it. Then I got a friend to mark my  artificial voicebox, unknown to me, in various ways, and endeavoured  quickly to discover what he had done. In this way I soon acquired a  considerable amount of skill in handling the instrument, and also became  thoroughly familiar with the image of the voicebox in the mirror.[M]  Having thus to a large extent mastered the mechanical part of my work, I  proceeded to make observations upon myself. I placed to the left of the  lamp an ordinary bedroom looking-glass, in which now appeared my own  face instead of the skull which hitherto occupied this place. I opened  my mouth, and by the help of the reflector directed the light into the  image of it in the looking-glass. I then continued in every way as I  had done with the skull, with this difference, however, that I had  first, as pointed out before, to warm the little spy mirror in order to  prevent its becoming dimmed in the throat.    An instrument has since been designed by the late Dr. G. D. Foulis, of  Glasgow, which for simplicity, general excellence, and cheapness, far  surpasses the above contrivance, and which I strongly recommend to  intending students of laryngoscopy. It consists of a plain stand on  which is placed a glass globe filled with water, the whole being  surmounted by a small square mirror. The rays from a lamp or candle,  placed behind the globe, are concentrated into the open mouth of the  observer, who is seated in front of it, enabling him, by the use of an  ordinary throat mirror, to inspect the movements of his own vocal  ligaments.    [Illustration]    This apparatus, as shown in the annexed drawing, including a throat  mirror, and safely packed for transmission, may be had from Messrs. W.  B. Hilliard & Sons, 65, Renfield Street, Glasgow, for the very small sum  of 7s. 6d.    Let not the reader who tries laryngoscopic investigations be discouraged  if, at first, violent retching is the result. It does not so much arise  from sensitiveness of the parts touched, as from awkwardness in  introducing the mirror. If he perseveres he will soon be rewarded by a  view of the pearly white vocal ligaments, and a little repeated practice  upon himself will enable him also to operate upon others without causing  them discomfort.    I close this chapter by again reminding amateur laryngoscopists that in  the vast majority of cases where the touch of the mirror causes retching  and gagging, it is due less to the sensitiveness of the person operated  upon than to the want of skill on the part of the operator. He should in  that case renew his experiments upon himself, and continue them until he  has fully mastered the use of the instrument, as it is not fair to make  others suffer for his own clumsiness.          THE TEACHINGS OF THE LARYNGOSCOPE.      On introducing the mirror into the throat we first see the back part of  the tongue, which has a very uneven surface, and which is, as a rule,  covered with greyish phlegm. We next notice a hollow space between the  tongue and the lid, which is divided by an elastic band forming a little  bridge between the two. Next comes the upper free part of the lid, the  shape of which greatly varies in different individuals. It hangs over  the voicebox, which it almost completely hides from view; but during the  production of a high tone on the vowel A, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#11)"],[1," keep and education and her own      sustenance for the time she must still live; that your father and she      had agreed that you should be brought up to a healthy and strenuous      life rather than to one of luxury; and she thought that it would be      better for the development of your character that you should learn to      be self-reliant and to be content with what your dear father had left      you.  She had always been a wise and thoughtful girl, and now all her      wisdom and thought were for you, your father's and her child.  When      she spoke of you and your future, she said many things which I      thought memorable.  One of them I remember to this day.  It was      apropos of my saying that there is a danger of its own kind in      extreme poverty.  A young man might know too much want.  She answered      me: \"True!  That is so!  But there is a danger that overrides it;\"      and after a time went on:        \"It is better not to know wants than not to know want!\"  I tell you,      boy, that is a great truth, and I hope you will remember it for      yourself as well as a part of the wisdom of your mother.  And here      let me say something else which is a sort of corollary of that wise      utterance:        I dare say you thought me very hard and unsympathetic that time I      would not, as one of your trustees, agree to your transferring your      little fortune to Miss MacKelpie.  I dare say you bear a grudge      towards me about it up to this day.  Well, if you have any of that      remaining, put it aside when you know the truth.  That request of      yours was an unspeakable delight to me.  It was like your mother      coming back from the dead.  That little letter of yours made me wish      for the first time that I had a son--and that he should be like you.      I fell into a sort of reverie, thinking if I were yet too old to      marry, so that a son might be with me in my declining years--if such      were to ever be for me.  But I concluded that this might not be.      There was no woman whom I knew or had ever met with that I could love      as your mother loved your father and as he loved her.  So I resigned      myself to my fate.  I must go my lonely road on to the end.  And then      came a ray of light into my darkness: there was you.  Though you      might not feel like a son to me--I could not expect it when the      memory of that sweet relationship was more worthily filled.  But I      could feel like a father to you.  Nothing could prevent that or      interfere with it, for I would keep it as my secret in the very holy      of holies of my heart, where had been for thirty years the image of a      sweet little child--your mother.  My boy, when in your future life      you shall have happiness and honour and power, I hope you will      sometimes give a thought to the lonely old man whose later years your      very existence seemed to brighten.        The thought of your mother recalled me to my duty.  I had undertaken      for her a sacred task: to carry out her wishes regarding her son.  I      knew how she would have acted.  It might--would--have been to her a      struggle of inclination and duty; and duty would have won.  And so I      carried out my duty, though I tell you it was a harsh and bitter task      to me at the time.  But I may tell you that I have since been glad      when I think of the result.  I tried, as you may perhaps remember, to      carry out your wishes in another way, but your letter put the      difficulty of doing so so clearly before me that I had to give it up.      And let me tell you that that letter endeared you to me more than      ever.        I need not tell you that thenceforth I followed your life very      closely.  When you ran away to sea, I used in secret every part of      the mechanism of commerce to find out what had become of you.  Then,      until you had reached your majority, I had a constant watch kept upon      you--not to interfere with you in any way, but so that I might be      able to find you should need arise.  When in due course I heard of      your first act on coming of age I was satisfied.  I had to know of      the carrying out of your original intention towards Janet Mac Kelpie,      for the securities had to be transferred.        From that time on I watched--of course through other eyes--your chief      doings.  It would have been a pleasure to me to have been able to      help in carrying out any hope or ambition of yours, but I realized      that in the years intervening between your coming of age and the      present moment you were fulfilling your ideas and ambitions in your      own way, and, as I shall try to explain to you presently, my      ambitions also.  You were of so adventurous a nature that even my own      widely-spread machinery of acquiring information--what I may call my      private \"intelligence department\"--was inadequate.  My machinery was      fairly adequate for the East--in great part, at all events.  But you      went North and South, and West also, and, in addition, you essayed      realms where commerce and purely real affairs have no      foothold--worlds of thought, of spiritual import, of psychic      phenomena--speaking generally, of mysteries.  As now and again I was      baffled in my inquiries, I had to enlarge my mechanism, and to this      end started--not in my own name, of course--some new magazines      devoted to certain branches of inquiry and adventure.  Should you      ever care to know more of these things, Mr. Trent, in whose name the      stock is left, will be delighted to give you all details.  Indeed,      these stocks, like all else I have, shall be yours when the time      comes, if you care to ask for them.  By means of _The Journal of      Adventure_, _The Magazine of Mystery_, _Occultism_, _Balloon and      Aeroplane_, _The Submarine_, _Jungle and Pampas_, _The Ghost World_,      _The Explorer_, _Forest and Island_, _Ocean and Creek_, I was often      kept informed when I should otherwise have been ignorant of your      whereabouts and designs.  For instance, when you had disappeared into      the Forest of the Incas, I got the first whisper of your strange      adventures and discoveries in the buried cities of Eudori from a      correspondent of _The Journal of Adventure_ long before the details      given in _The Times_ of the rock-temple of the primeval savages,      where only remained the little dragon serpents, whose giant ancestors      were rudely sculptured on the sacrificial altar.  I well remember how      I thrilled at even that meagre account of your going in alone into      that veritable hell.  It was from _Occultism_ that I learned how you      had made a stay alone in the haunted catacombs of Elora, in the far      recesses of the Himalayas, and of the fearful experiences which, when      you came out shuddering and ghastly, overcame to almost epileptic      fear those who had banded themselves together to go as far as the      rock-cut approach to the hidden temple.        All such things I read with rejoicing.  You were shaping yourself for      a wider and loftier adventure, which would crown more worthily your      matured manhood.  When I read of you in a description of Mihask, in      Madagascar, and the devil-worship there rarely held, I felt I had      only to wait for your home-coming in order to broach the enterprise I      had so long contemplated.  This was what I read:        \"He is a man to whom no adventure is too wild or too daring.  His      reckless bravery is a byword amongst many savage peoples and amongst      many others not savages, whose fears are not of material things, but      of the world of mysteries in and beyond the grave.  He dares not only      wild animals and savage men; but has tackled African magic and Indian      mysticism.  The Psychical Research Society has long exploited his      deeds of valiance, and looked upon him as perhaps their most trusted      agent or source of discovery.  He is in the very prime of life, of      almost giant stature and strength, trained to the use of all arms of      all countries, inured to every kind of hardship, subtle-minded and      resourceful, understanding human nature from its elemental form up.      To say that he is fearless would be inadequate.  In a word, he is a      man whose strength and daring fit him for any enterprise of any kind.      He would dare and do anything in the world or out of it, on the earth      or under it, in the sea or--in the air, fearing nothing material or      unseen, not man or ghost, nor God nor Devil.\"        If you ever care to think of it, I carried that cutting in my      pocket-book from that hour I read it till now.        Remember, again, I say, that I never interfered in the slightest way      in any of your adventures.  I wanted you to \"dree your own weird,\" as      the Scotch say; and I wanted to know of it--that was all.  Now, as I      hold you fully equipped for greater enterprise, I want to set your      feet on the road and to provide you with the most potent      weapon--beyond personal qualities--for the winning of great honour--a      gain, my dear nephew, which, I am right sure, does and will appeal to      you as it has ever done to me.  I have worked for it for more than      fifty years; but now that the time has come when the torch is      slipping from my old hands, I look to you, my dearest kinsman, to      lift it and carry it on.        The little nation of the Blue Mountains has from the first appealed      to me.  It is poor and proud and brave.  Its people are well worth      winning, and I would advise you to throw in your lot with them.  You      may find them hard to win, for when peoples, like individuals, are      poor and proud, these qualities are apt to react on each other to an      endless degree.  These men are untamable, and no one can ever succeed      with them unless he is"]]]
