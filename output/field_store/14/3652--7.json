Like the centurion  in the Gospels, he regarded himself as a man under authority, and he  expected a like obedience from those who were under him.    Marsden himself brought Henry Williams to New Zealand, and decided upon  the place of his abode. The chiefs were all anxious for the presence of  a missionary because of the commercial advantages which it brought.  Marsden was loth to refuse the request of some disconsolate relatives of  the slaughtered Hinaki, but he thought it wiser to bestow the favour  upon one who had been with him at Parramatta, even though the chief  himself was at the moment on the warpath with Hongi. Accordingly, the  new missionary was placed at Paihia, a village whose open beach lay  opposite to Kororareka, the great resort of European ships, from whose  crews the Maoris were acquiring vices and diseases more hideous than  their own. Its central situation gave to Paihia great advantages, and it  soon became the real focus of the mission.    That the work of the past eight years had not been altogether in vain  was proved by the altered demeanour of the Maoris. When the bell rang on  Sundays at Paihia, they came along the beach, dressed in European  clothes and carrying their books with the utmost propriety. It was only  a fashion, but it meant something. At the two older stations some of  them could repeat prayers and sing hymns. At Marsden's departure his  ship struck on the rocks while working out of the Bay, but the natives  of the island of Moturoa treated the shipwrecked passengers with  kindness, and forebore to plunder their goods.    This was not much, but it carried hope for the future. The real hope,  however, lay in the change of workers and the change of methods. At the  time of the wreck, Marsden had with him several of the older settlers  whose connection with the mission was now dissolved. In their places new  names gradually appear. Fairburn came with Henry Williams in 1823;  Clarke and Davis followed in the next year. Hamlin accompanied the Rev.  W. Williams in 1826. In 1828 came two clergymen--Yate and Brown--besides  a lay catechist, Baker. Chapman arrived in 1830, Preece in 1831,  Matthews in 1832. Puckey and Shepherd had in the meantime come from  Australia. King and Hall were left at Rangihoua, but the latter was  compelled by an asthmatic affection to leave New Zealand in 1824, and  for a time helped Marsden in his work among the Maori youths at  Parramatta.    It is evident from the above list that the \"settlement\" policy still  held its ground. And indeed settlers of the right type were urgently  needed. As Mr. Saunders points out, the mission had suffered greatly  through the lack of a skilled agriculturist. The first catechists were  town artisans, and so were most of those that followed. They had tried  hard to grow wheat, and not altogether without success. But on the whole  the settlements had failed to support themselves. After the  establishment of Kerikeri, Marsden had refused to send more flour from  Sydney. He himself had been so successful with his farm that he expected  others to do the same. If they would not work, he said, neither should  they eat. But he could command the labour of convicts to do the work:  this the New Zealand missionaries could not do. For long they had only  hoes and spades; the Maoris would not help them; the soil and the  climate were unfavourable. Some improvement there was when in 1824  Richard Davis, a Dorsetshire farmer, joined the staff. But even he was  beaten again and again in his attempts at wheat-growing. It was not  until 1830, when a move was made from the mangrove-lined shores of the  Bay to the higher and more English country twelve miles inland at  Waimate, that farming operations really began to succeed: then they  prospered in marvellous fashion.    On the whole, the \"settlement\" scheme was a failure. It was too high for  average human nature. The drastic regulations which Marsden left behind  him in 1823--regulations which forbad even the slightest transaction  between individual settlers and the trading ships--were tantamount to a  confession of a breakdown of the system. As for Henry Williams, he  determined on a change almost from the first. He would not try to raise  produce at Paihia. Seek ye _first_ the kingdom of God, he said. For  years he left himself without anything that could be called a house, but  he must have a church at once, and not only a church, but an organ. The  church was soon built, and a pipe organ, which delighted his Welsh ears,  was sent out by some of his friends at home. For the first two years he  devoted much of his time and money to the building of a vessel, which  should bring flour and groceries from Sydney, gather children from other  districts for his schools, and collect pork and potatoes wherewith to  feed them. In this 60-ton schooner, which was launched under the name of  the _Herald_ early in 1826, the missionary made several voyages to  Australia, to Tauranga, and to Hokianga, but she was wrecked on entering  the last-named harbour in 1828.    The schools were indeed the pivot of the mission during the first ten  years of the new order. Hitherto they had been small and intermittent,  but at Paihia they soon developed into large and important institutions.  Discipline was rigidly maintained. From early morning, when the bell  rang out at 5 o'clock, the hours of the day were mapped out for  different kinds of work. The girls' schools were well cared for by Mrs.  Williams--a lady whose literary gift has rescued from oblivion much of  the life of those far-off days. A part of each day was devoted by the  missionaries to their own acquisition of the Maori language, and to the  translation of the Bible and Prayer Book. At this work William Williams  excelled. He was an Oxford graduate, who joined his brother in the March  of 1826. The language seemed to have for him no terrors and hardly any  difficulties. From time to time small volumes of translated portions  with hymns and catechism were carried across to Sydney and brought back  in printed form. These were eagerly bought and read by the Maoris. They  were the first printed specimens of their own tongue, and the influence  they exerted was incalculable.    Learning, teaching, and translating occupied the brotherhood at Paihia,  while Davis was farming at Kerikeri or Waimate, and the Wesleyans were  founding a station further north at Whangaroa. Outside these quiet spots  there was still turmoil and bloodshed. The year 1827 was a particularly  stormy period. Hongi raided Whangaroa and there received a dangerous  wound. The Wesleyans were panic-stricken and fled overland to Kerikeri.  They were received there and at Paihia with brotherly welcome by men who  felt that their own turn might soon come. \"It is not easy,\" writes  Bishop Williams, \"to describe this breach which had been made upon the  mission body.\" As soon as the news became known in Australia, Marsden  flew to the scene in a warship, but he found the missionaries facing the  prospect with quiet courage. \"It gives me great pleasure,\" he wrote, \"to  find the missionaries so comfortable, living in unity and godly love,  devoting themselves to the work.\" They were well aware, of course, that  so far as their tenure depended upon human protection the outlook was  not bright. Hongi sent to them a message advising them to stay as long  as he should live, but to fly to their own country as soon as he should  die. They determined to stay at their posts as long as possible, but  they shipped some tons of goods to Sydney, in case of a _taua_ or  stripping-party which might be expected to visit them as soon as their  protector should have died. Such a proceeding would have been strictly  in accordance with Maori law of _muru_, and would be understood as a  complimentary testimonial to the dead man's dignity. But it would have  meant to the white men the loss of all their possessions, and the being  left naked and destitute in a savage country.    Early in the year 1828 the long-expected death of the great warrior took  place. He died as a heathen, his last words being, \"Be courageous, be  courageous!\" But he had drawn closer to the missionaries during the last  year of his life, and their estimates of him are nearly all favourable.  \"His conduct towards us,\" writes Clarke, \"was kind, and his last moments  were employed in requesting his survivors to treat us well.\" \"He was  ever the missionaries' friend,\" says Davis, \"a shrewd, thoughtful man,  very superior to any other native I have yet seen; the greatest man who  has ever lived in these islands.\" Bishop Williams' estimate is less  favourable, but the Committee of the C.M.S. (relying perhaps on Yate's  unqualified encomium) considered that he had been specially raised up by  God to be the protector and helper of the Gospel.    However beneficial his life may have been, the historian cannot help a  sigh of relief when he comes to his death. For it marks the time when  the mission began to stand on its own feet. So far from being  \"stripped,\" the missionaries actually rose in the estimation of the  Maoris. A quarrel arose out of Hongi's death, which led to hostilities  between the men of the Bay of Islands and those of Hokianga. The army of  the Bay was worsted, and both sides were not unwilling for peace if  honour could be preserved. Henry Williams and three of his colleagues  went to the field and visited the camps. Everywhere they were treated  with respect, and on Sunday a strict rest was enjoined as a mark of  deference to these ambassadors of peace. Williams preached to a  congregation of 500 on the neutral ground between the contending hosts.  The silent and respectful behaviour recalled Marsden's first  congregation fourteen years before. Next morning peace was concluded.  \"These,\" said Williams, \"are new days indeed!\"    The role of peacemaker thus taken up by the"]]]
