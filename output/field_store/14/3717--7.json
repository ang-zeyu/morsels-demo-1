Unluckily they had not any which they chose  to spare; but two or three shirts, some handkerchiefs, knives, and other  trifles, were given to them, and seemed to satisfy. Baneelon, willing  to instruct his countrymen, tried to put on a shirt, but managed it so  awkwardly, that a man of the name of M'Entire, the governor's gamekeeper,  was directed by Mr. White to assist him. This man, who was well known to  him, he positively forbade to approach, eyeing him ferociously, and with  every mark of horror and resentment. He was in consequence left to himself,  and the conversation proceeded as before. The length of his beard seemed  to annoy him much, and he expressed eager wishes to be shaved, asking  repeatedly for a razor. A pair of scissors was given to him, and he shewed  he had not forgotten how to use such an instrument, for he forthwith began  to clip his hair with it.    During this time, the women and children, to the number of more than fifty,  stood at a distance, and refused all invitations, which could be conveyed  by signs and gestures, to approach nearer. \"Which of them is your old  favourite, Barangaroo, of whom you used to speak so often?\"    \"Oh,\" said he, \"she is become the wife of Colbee! But I have got 'bulla  muree deein' (two large women) to compensate for her loss.\"    It was observed that he had received two wounds, in addition to his former  numerous ones, since he had left us; one of them from a spear, which had  passed through the fleshy part of his arm; and the other displayed itself  in a large scar above his left eye. They were both healed, and probably  were acquired in the conflict wherein he had asserted his pretensions to  the two ladies.    Nanbaree, all this while, though he continued to interrogate his  countrymen, and to interpret on both sides, shewed little desire to return  to their society, and stuck very close to his new friends. On being asked  the cause of their present meeting, Baneelon pointed to the whale, which  stunk immoderately, and Colbee made signals, that it was common among them  to cat until the stomach was so overladen as to occasion sickness.    Their demand of hatchets being re-iterated, notwithstanding our refusal,  they were asked why they had not brought with them some of their own? They  excused themselves by saying, that on an occasion of the present sort,  they always left them at home, and cut up the whale with the shell which is  affixed to the end of the throwing-stick.    Our party now thought it time to proceed on their original expedition, and  having taken leave of their sable friends, rowed to some distance, where  they landed, and set out for Broken Bay, ordering the coxswain of the boat,  in which they had come down, to go immediately and acquaint the governor  of all that had passed. When the natives saw that the boat was about to  depart, they crowded around her, and brought down, by way of present, three  or four great junks of the whale, and put them on board of her, the largest  of which, Baneelon expressly requested might be offered, in his name, to  the governor.    It happened that his excellency had this day gone to a landmark, which was  building on the South-head, near the flag-staff, to serve as a direction to  ships at sea, and the boat met him on his return to Sydney. Immediately on  receiving the intelligence, he hastened back to the South-head, and having  procured all the fire-arms which could be mustered there, consisting of  four muskets and a pistol, set out, attended by Mr. Collins and Lieutenant  Waterhouse of the navy.    When the boat reached Manly Cove, the natives were found still busily  employed around the whale. As they expressed not any consternation on  seeing us row to the beach, governor Phillip stepped out unarmed, and  attended by one seaman only, and called for Baneelon, who appeared,  but, notwithstanding his former eagerness, would not suffer the other  to approach him for several minutes. Gradually, however, he warmed  into friendship and frankness, and presently after Colbee came up. They  discoursed for some time, Baneelon expressing pleasure to see his old  acquaintance, and inquiring by name for every person whom he could  recollect at Sydney; and among others for a French cook, one of the  governor's servants, whom he had constantly made the butt of his ridicule,  by mimicking his voice, gait, and other peculiarities, all of which he  again went through with his wonted exactness and drollery. He asked also  particularly for a lady from whom he had once ventured to snatch a kiss;  and on being told that she was well, by way of proving that the token was  fresh in his remembrance, he kissed Lieutenant Waterhouse, and laughed  aloud. On his wounds being noticed, he coldly said, that he had received  them at Botany Bay, but went no farther into their history.    Hatchets still continued to be called for with redoubled eagerness,  which rather surprised us, as formerly they had always been accepted  with indifference. But Baneelon had probably demonstrated to them their  superiority over those of their own manufacturing. To appease their  importunity, the governor gave them a knife, some bread, pork, and other  articles, and promised that in two days he would return hither, and bring  with him hatchets to be distributed among them, which appeared to diffuse  general satisfaction.    Baneelon's love of wine has been mentioned; and the governor, to try  whether it still subsisted, uncorked a bottle, and poured out a glass of  it, which the other drank off with his former marks of relish and good  humour, giving for a toast, as he had been taught, \"The King.\"    Our party now advanced from the beach but, perceiving many of the Indians  filing off to the right and left, so as in some measure to surround them,  they retreated gently to their old situation, which produced neither alarm  or offence. The others by degrees also resumed their former position. A  very fine barbed spear of uncommon size being seen by the governor, he  asked for it. But Baneelon, instead of complying with the request, took  it away, and laid it at some distance, and brought back a throwing-stick,  which he presented to his excellency.    Matters had proceeded in this friendly train for more than half an hour,  when a native, with a spear in his hand, came forward, and stopped at  the distance of between twenty and thirty yards from the place where the  governor, Mr. Collins, Lieutenant Waterhouse, and a seaman stood. His  excellency held out his hand, and called to him, advancing towards him at  the same time, Mr. Collins following close behind. He appeared to be a  man of middle age, short of stature, sturdy, and well set, seemingly a  stranger, and but little acquainted with Baneelon and Colbee. The nearer  the governor approached, the greater became the terror and agitation of the  Indian. To remove his fear, governor Phillip threw down a dirk, which  he wore at his side. The other, alarmed at the rattle of the dirk, and  probably misconstruing the action, instantly fixed his lance in his  throwing-stick*.    [*Such preparation is equal to what cocking a gun, and directing it at its  object, would be with us. To launch the spear, or to touch the trigger,  only remains.]    To retreat, his excellency now thought would be more dangerous than to  advance. He therefore cried out to the man, Weeeree, Weeree, (bad; you  are doing wrong) displaying at the same time, every token of amity and  confidence. The words had, however, hardly gone forth, when the Indian,  stepping back with one foot, aimed his lance with such force and dexterity,  that striking* the governor's right shoulder, just above the collar-bone,  the point glancing downward, came out at his back, having made a wound of  many inches long. The man was observed to keep his eye steadily fixed on  the lance until it struck its object, when he directly dashed into the  woods and was seen no more.    [*His excellency described the shock to me as similar to a violent blow,  with such energy was the weapon thrown.]      Instant confusion on both sides took place. Baneelon and Colbee disappeared  and several spears were thrown from different quarters, though without  effect. Our party retreated as fast as they could, calling to those  who were left in the boat, to hasten up with firearms. A situation more  distressing than that of the governor, during the time that this lasted,  cannot readily be conceived: the pole of the spear, not less than ten  feet in length, sticking out before him, and impeding his flight, the butt  frequently striking the ground, and lacerating the wound. In vain did Mr.  Waterhouse try to break it; and the barb, which appeared on the other side,  forbade extraction, until that could be performed. At length it was broken,  and his excellency reached the boat, by which time the seamen with the  muskets had got up, and were endeavouring to fire them, but one only would  go off, and there is no room to believe that it was attended with any  execution.    When the governor got home, the wound was examined. It had bled a good deal  in the boat, and it was doubtful whether the subclavian artery might not  be divided. On moving the spear, it was found, however, that it might be  safely extracted, which was accordingly performed.    Apprehension for the safety of the party who had gone to Broken Bay, now  took place. Lieutenant Long, with a detachment of marines, was immediately  sent to escort them back, lest any ambush might be laid by the natives to  cut them off. When Mr. Long reached Manly Cove, the sun had set; however,  he pursued his way in the dark, scrambling over rocks and thickets, as well  as he could, until two o'clock on the following morning, when he overtook  them at a place where they had halted to sleep, about half-way between the  two harbours.    At day-break they all returned, and were surprised to find tracks in the  sand of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#11)"],[1,"alone, but a \"wine of Egypt\" (Cantharides  not being unknown to him), sold in drops, more precious than nectar;  which, what faded gentlemen of quality will not purchase with any thing  short of life. Consider, too, what may be done with potions, washes,  charms, love-philters, among a class of mortals idle from their mother's  womb,\" &c., &c.    It is well to know, once for all, that the count, chief-priest of his  order--which yet thrives, and if not great, deserves to be called for  its number, Legion--made money out of this his enterprising trade; that  he was enabled to pay his way; to ride post with the ever potent  \"voucher of respectability, a coach-and-four,\" with out-riders and  beef-eaters, and couriers and lackeys, and the other paraphernalia which  the greedy tooth of man desires--which helps one forward so far toward  happiness, provided always that \"there _is_ no heaven above and no hell  beneath,\" of which let each first make sure; and more than all, let such  as wish to travel this road, take great courage from the contemplation  of this one model.    We must hasten to the year 1776, a year rather noted in our annals, and  in that of England, perhaps, independently of this the \"first visit\" of  the famed Count Cagliostro to its shores, which happened then. Should it  have so chanced that he had lived now, would he have stopped there does  the reader think? Having an insight into _their_ national character, and  finding \"great greed and need,\" and but small heed, what might he not  have done on this transatlantic shore, whose free people can so nobly  cherish even its Barnum, its----, its----! But let names go. We make the  most of what we have, and if not equal to the greatest, the fault rests  not on our shoulders. We are not responsible for the past, if for the  present or future.    'Twas in England that the master developed most bravely the art of  prophecy; perhaps finding there a demand for his supply--such, according  to some, being the only law of God or man. It is enough to know that he  does a trade in foretelling the lucky lottery numbers by means of his  \"occult science,\" whereby at least he put money in _his_ purse, and  satisfied good-natured men that as there were gulls, and necessarily a  guller, he above all others deserved praise and not blame; the whole  thing, this life, being really a juggle, and the smartest fellow of  course the best juggler. As man goes on he developes, so many think--so  did Cagliostro, and in his growth he reaches to masonry--Egyptian  masonry--and in \"sworn secrecy\" finds a new Talisman, for which men will  pay five guineas each. He resolves to \"free it from all vile  ingredients, and make it a new Evangile.\" \"No religion is excluded from  the Egyptian society\"--for is it not certain that religion _pays_?  Charity too, pays, as we shall see by-and-by. No religion is  tabooed--none--all who admit the existence of a God, and the immortality  of the soul, may, for the small sum of five guineas, be certain to gain  \"perfection by means of a physical and moral regeneration.\" He promises  them by the former or physical to find the _prime matter_ or  philosopher's stone, and the _acacia_ which consolidates in man the  forces of the most vigorous youth, and renders him immortal; and by the  latter or moral, to procure them a Pentagon which shall restore man to  his primitive state of innocence, lost by his original sin. It must be  understood that this masonry was founded by Enoch and Elias, had been  corrupted by the Egyptian priests, but was now restored to its pristine  vigor by its last and greatest Grand Cophta, and includes not only men  but women, of whom the Countess Seraphina is Cophtess.    We cannot do better than to gain some insight into the forms and  symbolic practices of these worshippers; and especially will those who  desire to practise this or any short and easy way to perfection or  happiness, be glad to learn what has been done, and thus be encouraged  to begin.    In the _Essai sur les Illumines_, printed in Paris in 1789, are the  following details quoted by this before-mentioned known author.[1] These  bear an air of truth and probability which will win for them easy  admission. Many of them are not unlike what we have seen amongst us  during the few past years.    \"They take a young lad or a girl who is in the state of innocence: such  they call the _Pupil_ or _Colomb_: the Venerable communicates to him the  power he would have had before the fall of man; which power consists  mainly in commanding the pure spirits: these spirits are to the number  of seven. It is said they surround the shrine, and that they govern the  seven planets. Their names are Arael, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel,  Zobiachel, Anachiel.\" Nothing certainly can begin more favorably. We  learn that \"she the Colomb,\" can act in two ways, either behind a  curtain, behind a hieroglyphically-painted screen with table and three  candles, or before the Caraffe and showing face. If the _miracle fail_  it can only be because she is not \"in the state of innocence.\" _An  accident must be guarded against._ Surely our mystic professors, both  clerical and lay, will take heed to these things. Much may be learned.    Cagliostro accordingly (it is his own story) brought a little boy into  the lodge, son of a nobleman there. He placed him on his knees before a  table, whereon stood a bottle of pure water, and behind this some  lighted candles. He made an exorcism round the boy, put his hand on  head, and both in this attitude addressed their prayers to God for the  happy accomplishment of the work. Having then bid the child look into  the bottle, directly the child cried that he saw a garden. Knowing  hereby that Heaven assisted him [why this is so proven he does not  explain], Cagliostro took courage, and bade the child ask of God the  grace to see the Archangel Michael. At first the child said, \"I see  something white; I know not what it is.\" Then he began jumping and  stamping like a possessed creature, and cried, \"Now, I see a child like  myself, which seems to have something angelical (!)\" _All the assembly  and Cagliostro himself remained speechless with emotion...._ [How like  this is to what we at this day have seen.] The child being anew  exorcised with the hands of the Venerable on his head, and the customary  prayers addressed to Heaven, he looked into the bottle, and said he saw  his sister at that moment coming down stairs, and embracing one of her  brothers. That appeared impossible, the brother in question being then  hundreds of miles off. However Cagliostro felt not disconcerted; said  they might send to the country-house, where the sister was, and see--if  they chose!    Do some still doubt? Time nor paper will allow us to allay that doubt.  We must, as rapidly as we can, introduce what may yet be useful in  certain cases of the like kind, either in whole or in part. It is the  introduction of a novice into the holy Mysteries.    \"The recipiendary is led by a darksome path into a large hall, the  ceiling, the walls, the floor of which are covered by a black cloth,  sprinkled over with red flames and menacing serpents; three sepulchral  lamps emit from time to time a dying glimmer, and the eye half  distinguishes, in this lugubrious den, certain wrecks of mortality  suspended by funeral crapes; a heap of skeletons forms in the centre a  sort of altar; on both sides of it are piled books; some contain menaces  against the perjured; others the deadly narrative of the vengeance which  the invisible spirit has exacted; of the infernal evocations for a long  time pronounced in vain.    \"Eight hours elapse. Then phantoms, trailing mortuary vails, slowly  cross the hall and sink in caverns, without audible noise of trapdoors  or of falling. You notice only that they are gone by a fetid odor  exhaled from them.    \"The novice remains four and twenty hours in this gloomy abode, in the  midst of a freezing silence. A rigorous fast has already weakened his  thinking faculties. Liquors prepared for the purpose first weary and at  length wear out his senses. At his feet are placed three cups, filled  with a drink of a greenish color. Necessity lifts them to his lips:  involuntary fear repels them.    \"At last appear two men: looked upon as the ministers of Death. These  gird the pale brow of the recipiendary with an auroral-colored-ribbon  dipped in blood, and full of silvered characters mixed with our lady of  Loretto. He receives a copper crucifix, of two inches length: to his  neck are hung a sort of amulets wrapped in violet cloth. He is stripped  of his clothes; which two ministering brethren deposit on a funeral  pile, erected at the other end of the hall. With blood on his naked body  are traced crosses. In this state of suffering and humiliation, he sees  approaching with large strides five Phantoms armed with swords, and clad  in garments dropping blood. Their faces are vailed: they spread a velvet  carpet on the floor; kneel there, pray; and remain with outstretched  hands crossed on their breasts, and faces fixed on the ground in deep  silence. An hour passes in this painful attitude. After which fatiguing  trial, plaintive cries are heard; the funeral pile takes fire, yet casts  only a pale light; the garments are thrown on it and burnt. A colossal  and almost transparent figure rises from the very bosom of the pile. At  sight of it the five prostrated men fall into convulsions insupportable  to look on: the too faithful image of those foaming struggles wherein a  mortal, at hand-grips with a sudden pain, ends by sinking under it.    \"Then a trembling voice pierces the vault, and articulates the formula  of those execrable oaths that are to be sworn: my pen falters: I think  myself almost guilty to retrace them.\"    Strange as it may seem, we stop here with Monsieur the Author. Strange  too that some deny the reality of all this--and tell of magic lanterns"]]]
