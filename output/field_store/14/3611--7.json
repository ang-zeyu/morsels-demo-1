SUMMARY OF THE THREE PRECEDING CHAPTERS.    In the last two chapters the nature and force of Inheritance, the  circumstances which interfere with its power, and the tendency to Reversion,  with its many remarkable contingencies, were discussed. In the present chapter  some other related phenomena will be treated of, as fully as my materials  permit.    FIXEDNESS OF CHARACTER.    It is a general belief amongst breeders that the longer any character has been  transmitted by a breed, the more fully it will continue to be transmitted. I  do not wish to dispute the truth of the proposition that inheritance gains  strength simply through long continuance, but I doubt whether it can be  proved. In one sense the proposition is little better than a truism; if any  character has remained constant during many generations, it will be likely to  continue so, if the conditions of life remain the same. So, again, in  improving a breed, if care be taken for a length of time to exclude all  inferior individuals, the breed will obviously tend to become truer, as it  will not have been crossed during many generations by an inferior animal. We  have previously seen, but without being able to assign any cause, that, when a  new character appears, it is occasionally from the first constant, or  fluctuates much, or wholly fails to be transmitted. So it is with the  aggregate of slight differences which characterise a new variety, for some  propagate their kind from the first much truer than others. Even with plants  multiplied by bulbs, layers, etc., which may in one sense be said to form  parts of the same individual, it is well known that certain varieties retain  and transmit through successive bud-generations their newly-acquired  characters more truly than others. In none of these, nor in the following  cases, does there appear to be any relation between the force with which a  character is transmitted and the length of time during which it has been  transmitted. Some varieties, such as white and yellow hyacinths and white  sweet-peas, transmit their colours more faithfully than do the varieties which  have retained their natural colour. In the Irish family, mentioned in the  twelfth chapter, the peculiar tortoiseshell-like colouring of the eyes was  transmitted far more faithfully than any ordinary colour. Ancon and Mauchamp  sheep and niata cattle, which are all comparatively modern breeds, exhibit  remarkably strong powers of inheritance. Many similar cases could be adduced.    As all domesticated animals and cultivated plants have varied, and yet are  descended from aboriginally wild forms, which no doubt had retained the same  character from an immensely remote epoch, we see that scarcely any degree of  antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly true. In this case,  however, it may be said that changed conditions of life induce certain  modifications, and not that the power of inheritance fails; but in every case  of failure, some cause, either internal or external, must interfere. It will  generally be found that the organs or parts which in our domesticated  productions have varied, or which still continue to vary,--that is, which fail  to retain their former state,--are the same with the parts which differ in the  natural species of the same genus. As, on the theory of descent with  modification, the species of the same genus have been modified since they  branched off from a common progenitor, it follows that the characters by which  they differ from one another have varied, whilst other parts of the  organisation have remained unchanged; and it might be argued that these same  characters now vary under domestication, or fail to be inherited, from their  lesser antiquity. But variation in a state of nature seems to stand in some  close relation with changed conditions of life, and characters which have  already varied under such conditions would be apt to vary under the still  greater changes consequent on domestication, independently of their greater or  less antiquity.    Fixedness of character, or the strength of inheritance, has often been judged  of by the preponderance of certain characters in the crossed offspring between  distinct races; but prepotency of transmission here comes into play, and this,  as we shall immediately see, is a very different consideration from the  strength or weakness of inheritance. (14/1. See 'Youatt on Cattle' pages 92,  69, 78, 88, 163; and 'Youatt on Sheep' page 325. Also Dr. Lucas 'L'Hered.  Nat.' tome 2 page 310.) It has often been observed that breeds of animals  inhabiting wild and mountainous countries cannot be permanently modified by  our improved breeds; and as these latter are of modern origin, it has been  thought that the greater antiquity of the wilder breeds has been the cause of  their resistance to improvement by crossing; but it is more probably due to  their structure and constitution being better adapted to the surrounding  conditions. When plants are first subjected to culture, it has been found  that, during several generations, they transmit their characters truly, that  is, do not vary, and this has been attributed to ancient characters being  strongly inherited: but it may with equal or greater probability be consequent  on changed conditions of life requiring a long time for their cumulative  action. Notwithstanding these considerations, it would perhaps be rash to deny  that characters become more strongly fixed the longer they are transmitted;  but I believe that the proposition resolves itself into this,--that characters  of all kinds, whether new or old, tend to be inherited, and that those which  have already withstood all counteracting influences and been truly  transmitted, will, as a general rule, continue to withstand them, and  consequently be faithfully inherited.    PREPOTENCY IN THE TRANSMISSION OF CHARACTER.    When individuals, belonging to the same family, but distinct enough to be  recognised, or when two well-marked races, or two species, are crossed, the  usual result, as stated in the previous chapter, is, that the offspring in the  first generation are intermediate between their parents, or resemble one  parent in one part and the other parent in another part. But this is by no  means the invariable rule; for in many cases it is found that certain  individuals, races, and species, are prepotent in transmitting their likeness.  This subject has been ably discussed by Prosper Lucas (14/2. 'Hered. Nat.'  tome 2 pages 112-120.), but is rendered extremely complex by the prepotency  sometimes running equally in both sexes, and sometimes more strongly in one  sex than in the other; it is likewise complicated by the presence of secondary  sexual characters, which render the comparison of crossed breeds with their  parents difficult.    It would appear that in certain families some one ancestor, and after him  others in the same family, have had great power in transmitting their likeness  through the male line; for we cannot otherwise understand how the same  features should so often be transmitted after marriages with many females, as  in the case of the Austrian Emperors; and so it was, according to Niebuhr,  with the mental qualities of certain Roman families. (14/3. Sir H. Holland  'Chapters on Mental Physiology' 1852 page 234.) The famous bull Favourite is  believed (14/4. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1860 page 270.) to have had a prepotent  influence on the shorthorn race. It has also been observed (14/5. Mr. N.H.  Smith 'Observations on Breeding' quoted in 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page  278.) with English racehorses that certain mares have generally transmitted  their own character, whilst other mares of equally pure blood have allowed the  character of the sire to prevail. A famous black greyhound, Bedlamite, as I  hear from Mr. C.M. Brown \"invariably got all his puppies black, no matter what  was the colour of the bitch;\" but then Bedlamite \"had a preponderance of black  in his blood, both on the sire and dam side.\"    [The truth of the principle of prepotency comes out more clearly when distinct  races are crossed. The improved Shorthorns, notwithstanding that the breed is  comparatively modern, are generally acknowledged to possess great power in  impressing their likeness on all other breeds; and it is chiefly in  consequence of this power that they are so highly valued for exportation.  (14/6. Quoted by Bronn 'Geshichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 170. See Sturm 'Ueber  Racen' 1825 s. 104-107. For the niata cattle see my 'Journal of Researches'  1845 page 146.) Godine has given a curious case of a ram of a goat-like breed  of sheep from the Cape of Good Hope, which produced offspring hardly to be  distinguished from himself, when crossed with ewes of twelve other breeds. But  two of these half-bred ewes, when put to a merino ram, produced lambs closely  resembling the merino breed. Girou de Buzareingues (14/7. Lucas 'L'Heredi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#11)"],[1,"when they look through a  telescope, this throng of nebulae consists of small and inconspicuous  wisps as ill defined as bits of thistle-down floating high in the air.  There are more than three hundred of them all told, but even the  brightest are faint objects when seen with the largest of our  telescopes. Why do they congregate thus? That is the question which  lends an interest to the assemblage that no individual member of it  could alone command. It is a mystery, but beyond question it is  explicable. The explanation, however, is yet to be discovered.    The places of only three of the nebulae are indicated on the map. No.  2806 has been described as resembling in shape a shuttle. Its length is  nearly one third of the moon's diameter. It is brightest near the  center, and has several faint companions. No. 2961 is round, 4' in  diameter, and is accompanied by another round nebula in the same field  of view toward the south. No. 3105 is double, and powerful telescopes  show two more ghostly companions. There is an opportunity for good and  useful work in a careful study of the little nebulae that swim into view  all over this part of Virgo. Celestial photography has triumphs in store  for itself here.    Scattered over and around the region where the nebulae are thickest we  find eight or nine variable stars, three of the most remarkable of  which, R, S, and U, may be found on the map. R is very irregular,  sometimes attaining magnitude six and a half, while at other times its  maximum brightness does not exceed that of an eighth-magnitude star. At  minimum it sinks to the tenth or eleventh magnitude. Its period is one  hundred and forty-five days. U varies from magnitude seven or eight down  to magnitude twelve or under and then regains its light, in a period of  about two hundred and seven days. S is interesting for its brilliant red  color. When brightest, it exceeds the sixth magnitude, but at some of  its maxima the magnitude is hardly greater than the eighth. At minimum  it goes below the twelfth magnitude. Period, three hundred and  seventy-six days.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 10.]    Next east of Virgo is Libra, which contains a few notable objects (map  No. 10). The star alpha has a fifth-magnitude companion, distant about  230\", which can be easily seen with an opera glass. At the point marked  A on the map is a curious multiple star, sometimes referred to by its  number in Piazzi's catalogues as follows: 212 P. xiv. The two principal  stars are easily seen, their magnitudes being six and seven and a half;  distance 15\", p. 290 deg.. Burnham found four other faint companions, for  which it would be useless for us to look. The remarkable thing is that  these faint stars, the nearest of which is distant about 50\" from the  largest member of the group and the farthest about 129\", do not share,  according to their discoverer, in the rapid proper motion of the two  main stars.    In iota we find a double a little difficult for our three-inch. The  components are of magnitudes four and a half and nine, distance 57\", p.  110 deg.. Burnham discovered that the ninth-magnitude star consists of two  of the tenth less than 2\" apart, p. 24 deg..    No astronomer who happens to be engaged in this part of the sky ever  fails, unless his attention is absorbed by something of special  interest, to glance at beta Librae, which is famous as the only naked-eye  star having a decided green color. The hue is pale, but manifest.[3]    [3] Is the slight green tint perceptible in Sirius variable? I am  sometimes disposed to think it is.    The star is a remarkable variable, belonging to what is called the Algol  type. Its period, according to Chandler, is 2 days 7 hours, 51  minutes, 22.8 seconds. The time occupied by the actual changes is about  twelve hours. At maximum the star is of magnitude five and at minimum of  magnitude 6.2.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 11.]    We may now conveniently turn northward from Virgo in order to explore  Booetes, one of the most interesting of the constellations (map No. 11).  Its leading star alpha, Arcturus, is the brightest in the northern  hemisphere. Its precedence over its rivals Vega and Capella, long in  dispute, has been settled by the Harvard photometry. You notice that the  color of Arcturus, when it has not risen far above the horizon, is a  yellowish red, but when the star is near mid-heaven the color fades to  light yellow. The hue is possibly variable, for it is recorded that in  1852 Arcturus appeared to have nearly lost its color. If it should  eventually turn white, the fact would have an important bearing upon the  question whether Sirius was, as alleged, once a red or flame-colored  star.    But let us sit here in the starlight, for the night is balmy, and talk  about Arcturus, which is perhaps actually the greatest sun within the  range of terrestrial vision. Its parallax is so minute that the  consideration of the tremendous size of this star is a thing that the  imagination can not placidly approach. Calculations, based on its  assumed distance, which show that it _outshines the sun several thousand  times_, may be no exaggeration of the truth! It is easy to make such a  calculation. One of Dr. Elkin's parallaxes for Arcturus is 0.018\". That  is to say, the displacement of Arcturus due to the change in the  observer's point of view when he looks at the star first from one side  and then from the other side of the earth's orbit, 186,000,000 miles  across, amounts to only eighteen one-thousandths of a second of arc. We  can appreciate how small that is when we reflect that it is about equal  to the apparent distance between the heads of two pins placed an inch  apart and viewed from a distance of a hundred and eighty miles!    Assuming this estimate of the parallax of Arcturus, let us see how it  will enable us to calculate the probable size or light-giving power of  the star as compared with the sun. The first thing to do is to multiply  the earth's distance from the sun, which may be taken at 93,000,000  miles, by 206,265, the number of seconds of arc in a radian, the base of  circular measure, and then divide the product by the parallax of the  star. Performing the multiplication and division, we get the following:    19,182,645,000,000 / .018 = 1,065,702,500,000,000.    The quotient represents miles! Call it, in round numbers, a thousand  millions of millions of miles. This is about 11,400,000 times the  distance from the earth to the sun.    Now for the second part of the calculation: The amount of light received  on the earth from some of the brighter stars has been experimentally  compared with the amount received from the sun. The results differ  rather widely, but in the case of Arcturus the ratio of the star's light  to sunlight may be taken as about one twenty-five-thousand-millionth--i.  e., 25,000,000,000 stars, each equal to Arcturus, would together shed  upon the earth as much light as the sun does. But we know that light  varies inversely as the square of the distance; for instance, if the sun  were twice as far away as it is, its light would be diminished for us to  a quarter of its present amount. Suppose, then, that we could remove the  earth to a point midway between the sun and Arcturus, we should then be  5,700,000 times as far from the sun as we now are. In order to estimate  how much light the sun would send us from that distance we must square  the number 5,700,000 and then take the result inversely, or as a  fraction. We thus get 1 / 32,490,000,000,000, representing the ratio of  the sun's light at half the distance of Arcturus to that at its real  distance. But while receding from the sun we should be approaching  Arcturus. We should get, in fact, twice as near to that star as we were  before, and therefore its light would be increased for us fourfold. Now,  if the amount of sunlight had not changed, it would exceed the light of  Arcturus only a quarter as much as it did before, or in the ratio of  25,000,000,000 / 4 = 6,250,000,000 to 1. But, as we have seen, the  sunlight would diminish through increase of distance to one  32,490,000,000,000th part of its original amount. Hence its altered  ratio to the light of Arcturus would become 6,250,000,000 to  32,490,000,000,000, or 1 to 5,198.    This means that if the earth were situated midway between the sun and  Arcturus, it would receive 5,198 times as much light from that star as  it would from the sun! It is quite probable, moreover, that the heat of  Arcturus exceeds the solar heat in the same ratio, for the spectroscope  shows that although Arcturus is surrounded with a cloak of metallic  vapors proportionately far more extensive than the sun's, yet, smothered  as the great star seems in some respects to be, it rivals Sirius itself  in the intensity of its radiant energy.    If we suppose the radiation of Arcturus to be the same per unit of  surface as the sun's, it follows that Arcturus exceeds the sun about  375,000 times in volume, and that its diameter is no less than  62,350,000 miles! Imagine the earth and the other planets constituting  the solar system removed to Arcturus and set revolving around it in  orbits of the same forms and sizes as those in which they circle about  the sun. Poor Mercury! For that little planet it would indeed be a jump  from the frying pan into the fire, because, as it rushed to perihelion,  Mercury would plunge more than 2,500,000 miles beneath the surface of  the giant star. Venus and the earth would melt like snowflakes at the  mouth of a furnace. Even far-away Neptune, the remotest member of the  system, would swelter in torrid heat.    But stop! Look at the sky. Observe how small and motionless the disks of  the stars have become. Back to the telescopes at once, for this is a  token that the atmosphere is steady, and that \"good seeing\" may be  expected. It is fortunate, for we have some delicate work before us. The  very first double"]]]
