While they are at first adnate they become, with the  expansion of the cap, somewhat decurrent, showing in this particular a  resemblance to the plants of the genus Clitocybe. The stem is central,  except in a few species, where it is eccentric or lateral, notably the  latter in L. _obliquus_; spores white or yellowish, according to  species; Cooke says, \"rarely turning yellow.\" They are globose, or  nearly so, and slightly rough.    This genus is a large one, and contains many acrid species. Out of  fifty-three described and figured by Cooke, more than half are given as  having the milk more or less acrid. More than forty species have been  recorded as growing in this country, and many of these are extremely  acrid in taste.    A number of the species are edible, while others have been recorded as  deleterious, poisonous, etc. L. torminosus, L. piperatus, and L.  insulsus are species about which there seems to be difference of opinion  among authors as to their wholesomeness or edibility, some contending  that, in spite of their extreme acridity, they are edible when cooked,  and others that they are deleterious in their effects. L. _deliciosus_  and L. _volemus_ have a good reputation in this country as well as  abroad, and are quite abundant in some localities. They are more  frequent in temperate climates than in northern latitudes or in the  tropics.         [Illustration: Plate V.       LACTARIOUS DELICIOSUS.       1 General form. 2 Section. 3 Spores.]         PLATE V.         =Lactarius deliciosus= Fries. \"_Delicious Lactarius_\" _or_ \"_Orange       Milk Mushroom_.\"         EDIBLE.    Cap fleshy, viscid, at first convex, then nearly plane, becoming much  depressed in the centre, funnel-shaped, marked in the adult plant with  rings or rust-colored zones. Color of the cap dull orange, turning  paler, and grayish or greenish yellow when old or dried; margin at first  turned inwards; flesh whitish or tinged with yellow; gills decurrent,  crowded rather thick, sometimes slightly forked at the base, pale  yellow, sometimes a saffron yellow, exuding when bruised a saffron-red  or orange-colored liquid, hence the popular name of \"Orange Milk  Mushroom;\" stem smooth, somewhat spotted, stout, stuffed with a  yellowish pith, eventually becoming hollow; color about the same as that  of the cap. Spores subglobose, yellowish. Taste mild or very slightly  acrid when raw.    Mycophagists generally concur in the opinion that it is of very pleasant  flavor when cooked, and some speak very enthusiastically of its esculent  qualities.    Over-cooking is apt to make it tough. I find steaming in the oven with  butter, pepper, and salt, and a very small quantity of water, as oysters  are steamed, a very good method of preserving the juices and flavor.    It is found in Maryland, under the pines and sometimes in mossy and  swampy places. Prof. Underwood, President of the New York Mycological  Club, reports it as fairly abundant in Connecticut.    Lactarius _volemus_ Fries, the \"Orange-Brown Lactar,\" somewhat resembles  the L. _deliciosus_ in shape and size, but the cap is dry and glabrous  and the skin is apt to crack in patches in somewhat the same manner as  does that of the Russula _virescens_. It is a warm orange-brown in  color, varying slightly with age, and is not zoned. The gills are white  or yellowish and crowded, adnate in the young specimens, and decurrent  in the mature, exuding a white milk when bruised. The spores are  globose, and white. It is found in open woods. The flavor is much like  that of L. _deliciosus_, although perhaps not so rich.    One author states it as his experience that the Lactars which have  _bright_-colored milk, unchanging, are usually edible and have a mild  taste. L. _indigo_ Schwein has been recorded as less abundant than some  other species, but edible. The plant is a deep blue throughout, the milk  of the same color and unchanging. The taste of both flesh and milk is  mild. Specimens of this species were sent to me from western New York  several years ago by a correspondent who found it growing in quantities  in a corn field. He had cooked several dishes of it, and reported its  flavor as very agreeable.    L. _vellereus_ and L. _piperatus_ are very common in fir woods. The  plants are large and stout, white throughout, the milk white and  excessively acrid; gills decurrent, unequal and narrow. The milk in  _vellereus_ is apt to be scanty but copious in _piperatus_.    Of L. _piperatus_, Worthington Smith says: \"So strongly acrid is the  milk that if it be allowed to trickle over tender hands it will sting  like the contact of nettles; and if a drop be placed on the lips or  tongue the sensation will be like the scalding of boiling water.\" He  records it as \"poisonous.\" Fries and Curtis say that, \"notwithstanding  its intense acridity, it is edible when cooked.\" Cordier, while  recording it as edible, says that the milk, and butter made from the  milk of cows fed with it, are bitter and nauseous, although cows eat it  with avidity. Gibson, while quoting one or two authors as to its  edibility when cooked, says: \"Its decidedly ardent tang warns me not to  dwell too enthusiastically upon its merits in a limited selection of  desirable esculents.\" The Secretary of the Boston Mycological Club,  writing in the Club bulletin, says \"it has been eaten as a sort of duty  after the acridity was cooked out,\" but does not commend it. It is  spoken of as \"an unattractive fungus which usurps in the woods the place  that might well be occupied by something better.\" In this opinion I  fully concur.    L. _torminosus_, \"_Wooly Lactarius_,\" sometimes called the \"_Colic  Lactarius_,\" has been termed acrid and poisonous by Badham. Cordier and  Letellier, on the other hand, say that it can be eaten with impunity  when cooked. Gillet declares it deleterious and even dangerous in the  raw state, constituting a very strong and drastic purgative. One author  states that, although it does not constitute an agreeable article of  food, it is eaten in some parts of France and in Russia. Considering the  differences of opinion which exist with regard to this and other  extremely acrid species, it would seem the part of prudence for persons  with delicate stomachs to avoid the use of very acrid species, for,  though the acridity may be expelled by cooking, there would seem to be  no necessity for risking unpleasant or dangerous results while the range  of unquestionably wholesome and agreeable species is sufficiently wide  to satisfy the most enthusiastic mycophagist.         AGARICINI.         LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE OR YELLOWISH).    Armillaria Fries. Cooke places Armillaria in the order Agaricini, _genus  Agaricus_, making of it a _sub_-genus. Saccardo, in taking it out of  Agaricus, elevates it to the position of a separate genus. The name  Armillaria is derived from a Greek word, meaning a ring or bracelet,  referring to its ringed stem.    In the plants of the Armillaria the veil is partial in infancy,  attaching the edge of the cap to the upper part of the stem; the stem  furnished with a ring. Below the ring the veil is concrete with the  stem, forming scurfy scales upon it. The gills are broadly adnexed. In  abnormal specimens the ring is sometimes absent, or appearing only in  scales, running down the stem. Spores white. The species are few; eight  are recorded as growing in the United States. Cooke describes twelve  species found in Great Britain.         [Illustration: Plate VI.       AGARICUS (ARMILLARIA) MELLEUS.       Group from Hynesboro Park, Md., U. S.       K. MAYO, del.]         PLATE VI.         =Ag. (Armillaria) melleus= Vahl. \"_Honey-Colored Armillaria._\"         EDIBLE.    Cap fleshy, rather thin at the margin, at first subconical, then  slightly rounded, or nearly plane, clothed with minute hairy tufts;  margin sometimes striate, color varying, usually a pale-yellowish or  honey color or light reddish brown; flesh whitish. Gills whitish or  paler than the cap, growing mealy with the shedding of the profuse white  spores, and often spotted with reddish-brown stains, adnate, ending with  decurrent tooth. Stem fibrillose, elastic, stuffed or hollow, ringed,  and adorned with floccose scales which often disappear with age; in some  varieties distinctly bulbous at the base, in others showing tapering  root. Specimens occur in which the ring is wanting or only traces of it  appear in the form of scales encircling the stem. Veil usually firm,  membraneous, and encircling the stem in a well-pronounced ring or  collar, but sometimes filmy as a spider's web, in very young specimens  hiding the gills, but breaking apart as the cap expands.    Manner of growth caespitose, generally on decayed tree stumps, although  the group figured in the plate was found growing on moist sand, mixed  with clay, on a roadside in Hynesbury Park.    Authors differ widely as to the value of this species as an esculent. I  have only eaten the very young and small specimens when cooked, and  found them very palatable. A Boston mycophagist records it as \"very  good,\" fried after five minutes' boiling in salted water. Prof. Peck,  having tried it, considers it \"a perfectly safe species, but not of  first-rate quality.\" It is very common in Maryland and Virginia, and in  the mountain districts prolific. I have talked with Bohemians and with  Germans who have gathered it in basketfuls in the vicinity of the  District of Columbia, who speak well of it, considering it a valuable  addition to the table. Its prolific growth makes it valuable to those  who like it. There are no species recorded as dangerous in this group.    Ag. (Armillaria) robustus, a very stout species, with a fleshy, compact,  smooth cap, bay color or tawny, occurs in the Maryland woods, and in the  open woods of the Massachusetts coast.         AGARICINI. Fries.    _Genus "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#11)"],[1,"flocks are usually confined to breeding yards. The size of  these yards depends upon the size of the breeding flock but large yards  are not required. A yard for 200 breeders is not as a rule larger  than 100 by 200 feet including the water part of the yard. Houses and  yards should be located on sand if possible as this is easier to keep  clean and therefore keeps the birds in better condition. Occasional  flocks of breeding ducks are allowed their liberty but this is not  common practice nor is it good practice unless the surroundings are  clean and the ducks do not have access to stagnant mud or refuse in  which they can work. If ducks work too much in this kind of material  they will eat more or less of it which injures the eggs for hatching  purposes.    Many different styles of houses are used for breeders, some of which are  decidedly more elaborate than is necessary. A very satisfactory  economical house is one 20 feet deep, 7 feet high in front and 4 feet at  back, with a shed roof. This can be constructed of tongue and groove  material or may be made of unmatched stuff and covered with paper. A  house of this proportion makes a good light house and it can be carried  in length according to the size of the flock. For a breeding unit of 200  ducks, which is a good unit to use, a house 20 feet deep and 30 to 40  feet long is suitable. No floor is used in the house but it should be  well filled up with dirt so that the water will not come in.    One or more good sized openings are left in the front of the breeding  house for ventilation, or windows may be placed in the front which can  be used for this purpose. Good ventilation is necessary. Additional  ventilation is secured from the doors. If the weather is mild the doors  are left partly open, if cold they are nearly closed, while when the  weather is hot they are left entirely open. A good scheme is to use a  sort of Dutch door so that the bottom or top half can be opened  independently. In this way the top part of the doors can be left open so  as to let in the sunlight and still keep the ducks in the house or the  top may be left closed and the bottom opened so as to allow the ducks to  go in or out and still cut down the amount of ventilation. When the  weather is warm the doors may be left entirely open except for a board  18 inches to 2 feet wide inserted in the bottom of the door when it is  desired to keep the ducks in.    Shade is essential for the breeders and if not provided naturally by  trees must be supplied by means of artificial shelters.    [Illustration: FIG. 17. Upper--Rear and end view of house or shed used  for fattening ducks. Lower--General view on a duck plant, showing open  front fattening houses in the foreground and houses for breeders in the  background. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 18. A good house for breeding ducks. It is 20 feet  deep, 40 feet long, 7 feet high in front and 4 feet in the rear and will  accommodate 200 breeders. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal  Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Bedding and Cleaning the Breeding Houses._ Usually straw, meadow hay,  or swale hay is used for bedding. Shavings make good material for this  purpose if they do not contain too much sawdust. The principal objection  to shavings is that it takes longer to bed with them. Often a few joists  are laid at the back of the house on which to pile bales of straw or  other bedding so that it will be kept dry and will serve as an emergency  supply available for bedding the house in stormy days. The houses should  be bedded fairly often in order to keep the floors clean and dry and so  as not to allow the ducks' feet to get cold. The frequency with which  bedding is necessary will depend upon the weather. In winter it may at  times be necessary to bed every day. In May it may be necessary only  twice a week and still later in the season only once a week. In wet  weather the ducks track in lots of mud and water and frequent bedding  helps to keep the eggs clean. The houses are cleaned out only once a  year and this is usually done after the ducks have stopped laying. To  clean out the houses while the ducks are laying would disturb them and  tend to stop their egg production.    _Cleaning the Breeding Yards._ The yards should be cleaned whenever they  need it, that is, whenever they begin to get sloppy or sticky. It is a  matter of judgment to decide when this is necessary. The character of  the soil influences this, as sandy yards absorb the droppings better and  do not need cleaning as frequently as heavier soils. In the yards for  the breeding ducks, or the water yards, this will as a rule not be over  2 or 3 times a season. In dry weather cleaning is accomplished by  sweeping the yards with a broom. In wet weather the droppings spread  over the yard and are packed down by the ducks' feet until they form a  layer of putty-like material which cannot be swept off but is scraped  off by means of a hoe.    _Water Yards for Breeders._ Formerly it was the consensus of opinion  that breeders needed water in which they could swim in order to keep in  good breeding condition and to give the best results in fertility of the  eggs. At present it is not considered necessary to have sufficient  water to permit swimming although many breeders prefer to do this and  feel that they get better results from it. However, breeding ducks have  been and are being kept successfully in dry yards where water is  supplied to them simply in an amount sufficient to allow them to drink  and to clean themselves. Where water yards are provided this should not  be on stagnant water but there should be some circulation of the water  so as to keep it clean and fresh. Where the lay of the land is such that  it is not possible to run all the yards down to a stream for this  purpose it is sometimes possible to dig a canal or ditch from the stream  to the yards so as to allow the ducks access to the water. Where the  yards can extend into the water it saves a great deal of labor or  considerable expense in equipment as it is not then necessary to provide  the ducks with drinking water by means of some artificial arrangement  such as a concrete gutter or ditch extending through the yards or by  means of artificial ponds.    If the water yards used freeze over in winter it is necessary to cut  holes in the ice so that the ducks can get water for drinking purposes.  Sometimes the ducks will go into these water holes and after getting  their plumage wet will come out and sit down in the yard and freeze fast  to the ground. During such weather conditions it is necessary to make  the rounds of the yards frequently and to loosen any ducks that have  frozen fast. If they are left in that condition they are apt to  injure themselves in trying to pull free and if left too long will die.    [Illustration: FIG. 19. Another successful type of house for breeding  ducks. It is 20 ft. by 40 ft. and is divided into two pens each of which  will accommodate 100 breeders. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal  Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 20. Meal time for the breeders. (_Photograph from  the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Feeding the Breeders._ Breeding ducks are fed twice a day, in the  morning and at night. It is usual practice to feed the breeders last in  the morning and first at night. The reason for feeding them last in the  morning is that they are usually fed in the yards rather than the house  and they should be kept in until they are through laying which will be  after daylight. A good breeding ration consists of the following, the  proportions being given by measure in bushels.    1 bushel bran.  1 bushel low-grade flour.  1 bushel corn meal.  1 bushel green feed.  1/2 bushel either raw or cooked vegetables.  1 bushel in 10 of beef scrap.  1/2 bushel in 10 of cooked fish.    This ration will keep the breeding ducks in good flesh but there will be  no difficulty in their getting too fat. It is also a good laying ration  and will promote good egg production. The vegetables used in this ration  usually consist of sugar beets, cow beets, potatoes, etc. However, if  potatoes are used the amount of flour in the ration should be reduced a  little so as not to make the ration too heavy. Beets, when used, are fed  raw cut up and mixed in the feed. Small potatoes, boiled and mixed in  the feed are more valuable as they have a greater food value than beets.  Some duck growers feed fish entirely, using no beef scrap. This is done  where a plentiful supply of fish can be secured by going out into the  bay after them. However, this is not very good practice for a sufficient  supply of fish may not always be available and the ducks are so fond of  the fish that they will not eat well the beef scrap used as a substitute  for the fish, until they have become used to it. Fish is prepared for  feeding by boiling it thoroughly in a feed cooker.    The available land on the plant is used to grow a supply of green feed.  Rye is used for this purpose early in the spring as soon as it is high  enough to mow. It is mowed the first time when it is like a lawn. At  this stage it does not have to be cut up. Oats are used in the same way.  During the summer fodder corn is used. This is the poorest crop for the  purpose but is as a rule the only one available at that time. Rape is  sowed in August and its use begun about the time of the first frost and  kept up until the hard freezes come or until it is buried under the  snow. Creek grass which is secured from the fresh water streams on Long  Island by going out in a flat bottom boat and raking it off the creek  bottom with a wooden rake, is very much relished by the ducks and is  used whenever it is available. However, the supply of this material is  not as plentiful as it"]]]
