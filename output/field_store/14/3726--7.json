Market value of publicly traded shares    This entry gives the value of shares issued by publicly traded  companies at a price determined in the national stock markets on the  final day of the period indicated. It is simply the latest price per  share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares,  cumulated over all companies listed on the particular exchange.    Median age    This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically  equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and  half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age  distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from  a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for  the importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine    Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage  of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary  ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs,  etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total, ships  by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.  Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT  for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight  tonnage is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc.,  that a ship can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line.  GRT or gross register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the  entire sheltered volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers  and converting it to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton;  there is no stable relationship between GRT and DWT.  Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo  ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers,  combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas  tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers,  petroleum tankers, passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar  carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships,  short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.  Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong  to owners in another.  Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one  country but fly the flag of another.      Military    This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military - note    This entry includes miscellaneous military information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Military branches    This entry lists the service branches subordinate to defense  ministries or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air, and  marine forces).    Military expenditures    This entry gives spending on defense programs for the most recent  year available as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP); the GDP  is calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in terms of  purchasing power parity (PPP).    Military service age and obligation    This entry gives the required ages for voluntary or conscript  military service and the length of service obligation.      Money figures    All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.    N        National holiday    This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.    Nationality    This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.    Natural gas - consumption    This entry is the total natural gas consumed in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - exports    This entry is the total natural gas exported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - imports    This entry is the total natural gas imported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - production    This entry is the total natural gas produced in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - proved reserves    This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic  meters (cu m). Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas,  which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be  estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially  recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and  under current economic conditions.    Natural hazards    This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources    This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and  other resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate    This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number  of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country  as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the  overall level of population change. High levels of migration can  cause problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic  strife (if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force,  perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).    O        Oil - consumption    This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per day (bbl/day).  The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported  and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of  stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - exports    This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports    This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - production    This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per day (bbl/day).  The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported  and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of  stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - proved reserves    This entry is the stock of proved reserves of crude oil in barrels  (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by  analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a  high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a  given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    P      People    This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics  of the people and their society.    People - note    This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.      Personal Names - Capitalization    The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals  for the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of  different cultures and naming conventions. The need for  capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other  indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following  examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU  SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam  Shah. By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital  letters can be used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman  Mao, President Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of  capitalization is extended to the names of leaders with surnames  that are not commonly used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For  Vietnamese names, the given name is capitalized because officials  are referred to by their given name rather than by their surname.  For example, the president of Vietnam is Tran Duc LUONG. His surname  is Tran, but he is referred to by his given name - President LUONG.

A number of African states  practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences.  Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated  to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial  powers.  European Union Law - A sub-discipline of international law known as  \"supranational law\" in which the rights of sovereign nations are  limited in relation to one another. Also referred to as the Law of  the European Union or Community Law, it is the unique and complex  legal system that operates in tandem with the laws of the 27 member  states of the European Union (EU). Similar to federal states, the EU  legal system ensures compliance from the member states because of  the Union's decentralized political nature. The European Court of  Justice (ECJ), established in 1952 by the Treaty of Paris, has been  largely responsible for the development of EU law. Fundamental  principles of European Union law include: subsidiarity - the notion  that issues be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized  competent authority; proportionality - the EU may only act to the  extent needed to achieve its objectives; conferral - the EU is a  union of member states, and all its authorities are voluntarily  granted by its members; legal certainty - requires that legal rules  be clear and precise; and precautionary principle - a moral and  political principle stating that if an action or policy might cause  severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, in  the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the  burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action.  French Law - A type of civil law that is the legal system of France.  The French system also serves as the basis for, or is mixed with,  other legal systems in approximately 50 countries, notably in North  Africa, the Near East, and the French territories and dependencies.  French law is primarily codified or systematic written civil law.  Prior to the French Revolution (1789-1799), France had no single  national legal system. Laws in the northern areas of present-day  France were mostly local customs based on privileges and exemptions  granted by kings and feudal lords, while in the southern areas Roman  law predominated. The introduction of the Napoleonic Civil Code  during the reign of Napoleon I in the first decade of the 19th  century brought major reforms to the French legal system, many of  which remain part of France's current legal structure, though all  have been extensively amended or redrafted to address a modern  nation. French law distinguishes between \"public law\" and \"private  law.\" Public law relates to government, the French Constitution,  public administration, and criminal law. Private law covers issues  between private citizens or corporations. The most recent changes to  the French legal system - introduced in the 1980s - were the  decentralization laws, which transferred authority from centrally  appointed government representatives to locally elected  representatives of the people.  International Law - The law of the international community, or the  body of customary rules and treaty rules accepted as legally binding  by states in their relations with each other. International law  differs from other legal systems in that it primarily concerns  sovereign political entities. There are three separate disciplines  of international law: public international law, which governs the  relationship between provinces and international entities and  includes treaty law, law of the sea, international criminal law, and  international humanitarian law; private international law, which  addresses legal jurisdiction; and supranational law - a legal  framework wherein countries are bound by regional agreements in  which the laws of the member countries are held inapplicable when in  conflict with supranational laws. At present the European Union is  the only entity under a supranational legal system. The term  \"international law\" was coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1780 in his  Principles of Morals and Legislation, though laws governing  relations between states have been recognized from very early times  (many centuries B.C.). Modern international law developed alongside  the emergence and growth of the European nation-states beginning in  the early 16th century. Other factors that influenced the  development of international law included the revival of legal  studies, the growth of international trade, and the practice of  exchanging emissaries and establishing legations. The sources of  International law are set out in Article 38-1 of the Statute of the  International Court of Justice within the UN Charter.  Islamic Law - The most widespread type of religious law, it is the  legal system enforced in over 30 countries, particularly in the Near  East, but also in Central and South Asia, Africa, and Indonesia. In  many countries Islamic law operates in tandem with a civil law  system. Islamic law is embodied in the sharia, an Arabic word  meaning \"the right path.\" Sharia covers all aspects of public and  private life and organizes them into five categories: obligatory,  recommended, permitted, disliked, and forbidden. The primary sources  of sharia law are the Qur'an, believed by Muslims to be the word of  God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, and the  Sunnah, the teachings of the Prophet and his works. In addition to  these two primary sources, traditional Sunni Muslims recognize the  consensus of Muhammad's companions and Islamic jurists on certain  issues, called ijmas, and various forms of reasoning, including  analogy by legal scholars, referred to as qiyas. Shia Muslims reject  ijmas and qiyas as sources of sharia law.  Mixed Law - Also referred to as pluralistic law, mixed law consists  of elements of some or all of the other main types of legal systems  - civil, common, customary, and religious. The mixed legal systems  of a number of countries came about when colonial powers overlaid  their own legal systems upon colonized regions but retained elements  of the colonies' existing legal systems.  Napoleonic Civil Code - A type of civil law, referred to as the  Civil Code or Code Civil des Francais, forms part of the legal  system of France, and underpins the legal systems of Bolivia, Egypt,  Lebanon, Poland, and the US state of Louisiana. The Civil Code was  established under Napoleon I, enacted in 1804, and officially  designated the Code Napoleon in 1807. This legal system combined the  Teutonic civil law tradition of the northern provinces of France  with the Roman law tradition of the southern and eastern regions of  the country. The Civil Code bears similarities in its arrangement to  the Roman Body of Civil Law (see Civil Law above). As enacted in  1804, the Code addressed personal status, property, and the  acquisition of property. Codes added over the following six years  included civil procedures, commercial law, criminal law and  procedures, and a penal code.  Religious Law - A legal system which stems from the sacred texts of  religious traditions and in most cases professes to cover all  aspects of life as a seamless part of devotional obligations to a  transcendent, imminent, or deep philosophical reality. Implied as  the basis of religious law is the concept of unalterability, because  the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or  governments. However, a detailed legal system generally requires  human elaboration. The main types of religious law are sharia in  Islam, halakha in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups.  Sharia is the most widespread religious legal system (see Islamic  Law), and is the sole system of law for countries including Iran,  the Maldives, and Saudi Arabia. No country is fully governed by  halakha, but Jewish people may decide to settle disputes through  Jewish courts and be bound by their rulings. Canon law is not a  divine law as such because it is not found in revelation. It is  viewed instead as human law inspired by the word of God and applying  the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the  church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Roman  Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican  Communion.  Roman Law - A type of civil law developed in ancient Rome and  practiced from the time of the city's founding (traditionally 753  B.C.) until the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century A.D.  Roman law remained the legal system of the Byzantine (Eastern  Empire) until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Preserved  fragments of the first legal text, known as the Law of the Twelve  Tables, dating from the 5th century B.C., contained specific  provisions designed to change the prevailing customary law. Early  Roman law was drawn from custom and statutes; later, during the time  of the empire, emperors asserted their authority as the ultimate  source of law. The basis for Roman laws was the idea that the exact  form - not the intention - of words or of actions produced legal  consequences. It was only in the late 6th century A.D. that a  comprehensive Roman code of laws was published (see Civil Law  above). Roman law served as the basis of law systems developed in a  number of continental European countries.  Roman-Dutch Law - A type of civil law based on Roman law as applied  in the Netherlands. Roman-Dutch law serves as the basis for legal  systems in seven African countries, as well as Guyana, Indonesia,  and Sri Lanka. This law system, which originated in the province of  Holland and expanded throughout the Netherlands (to be replaced by  the French Civil Code in 1809), was instituted in a number of  sub-Saharan African countries during the Dutch colonial period.
