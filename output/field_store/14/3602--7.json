The shepherd boldly passed through the open door, and soon found  himself in a wonderful jewelled cave hung with stalactites, in the  centre of which stood a beautiful woman, clad in silvery robes, and  attended by a host of lovely maidens crowned with Alpine roses. In his  surprise, the shepherd sank to his knees, and as in a dream heard the  queenly central figure bid him choose anything he saw to carry away  with him. Although dazzled by the glow of the precious stones around  him, the shepherd's eyes constantly reverted to a little nosegay of  blue flowers which the gracious apparition held in her hand, and he  now timidly proffered a request that it might become his. Smiling with  pleasure, Holda, for it was she, gave it to him, telling him he had  chosen wisely and would live as long as the flowers did not droop and  fade. Then, giving the shepherd a measure of seed which she told him  to sow in his field, the goddess bade him begone; and as the thunder  pealed and the earth shook, the poor man found himself out upon the  mountain-side once more, and slowly wended his way home to his wife,  to whom he told his adventure and showed the lovely blue flowers and  the measure of seed.    The woman reproached her husband bitterly for not having brought some  of the precious stones which he so glowingly described, instead of the  blossoms and seed; nevertheless the man proceeded to sow the latter,  and he found to his surprise that the measure supplied seed enough  for several acres.    Soon the little green shoots began to appear, and one moonlight  night, while the peasant was gazing upon them, as was his wont,  for he felt a curious attraction to the field which he had sown, and  often lingered there wondering what kind of grain would be produced,  he saw a misty form hover above the field, with hands outstretched  as if in blessing. At last the field blossomed, and countless little  blue flowers opened their calyxes to the golden sun. When the flowers  had withered and the seed was ripe, Holda came once more to teach the  peasant and his wife how to harvest the flax--for such it was--and from  it to spin, weave, and bleach linen. As the people of the neighbourhood  willingly purchased both linen and flax-seed, the peasant and his  wife soon grew very rich indeed, and while he ploughed, sowed, and  harvested, she spun, wove, and bleached the linen. The man lived to  a good old age, and saw his grandchildren and great-grandchildren  grow up around him. All this time his carefully treasured bouquet  had remained fresh as when he first brought it home, but one day he  saw that during the night the flowers had drooped and were dying.    Knowing what this portended, and that he too must die, the peasant  climbed the mountain once more to the glacier, and found again the  doorway for which he had often vainly searched. He entered the icy  portal, and was never seen or heard of again, for, according to the  legend, the goddess took him under her care, and bade him live in  her cave, where his every wish was gratified.        Tannhaeuser    According to a mediaeval tradition, Holda dwelt in a cave in the  Hoerselberg, in Thuringia, where she was known as Frau Venus, and  was considered as an enchantress who lured mortals into her realm,  where she detained them for ever, steeping their senses in all  manner of sensual pleasures. The most famous of her victims was  Tannhaeuser, who, after he had lived under her spell for a season,  experienced a revulsion of feeling which loosened her bonds over his  spirit and induced anxious thoughts concerning his soul. He escaped  from her power and hastened to Rome to confess his sins and seek  absolution. But when the Pope heard of his association with one of  the pagan goddesses whom the priests taught were nothing but demons,  he declared that the knight could no more hope for pardon than to  see his staff bear buds and bloom.          \"Hast thou within the nets of Satan lain?      Hast thou thy soul to her perdition pledged?      Hast thou thy lip to Hell's Enchantress lent,      To drain damnation from her reeking cup?      Then know that sooner from the withered staff      That in my hand I hold green leaves shall spring,      Than from the brand in hell-fire scorched rebloom      The blossoms of salvation.\"                Tannhaeuser (Owen Meredith).      Crushed with grief at this pronouncement, Tannhaeuser fled, and,  despite the entreaties of his faithful friend, Eckhardt, no great  time elapsed ere he returned to the Hoerselberg, where he vanished  within the cave. He had no sooner disappeared, however, than the Pope's  messengers arrived, proclaiming that he was pardoned, for the withered  staff had miraculously bloomed, thus proving to all that there was  no sin too heinous to be pardoned, providing repentance were sincere.          \"Dashed to the hip with travel, dewed with haste,      A flying post, and in his hand he bore      A withered staff o'erflourished with green leaves;      Who,--followed by a crowd of youth and eld,      That sang to stun with sound the lark in heaven,      'A miracle! a miracle from Rome!      Glory to God that makes the bare bough green!'--      Sprang in the midst, and, hot for answer, asked      News of the Knight Tannhaeuser.\"                Tannhaeuser (Owen Meredith).      Holda was also the owner of a magic fountain called Quickborn, which  rivalled the famed fountain of youth, and of a chariot in which she  rode from place to place when she inspected her domain. This vehicle  having once suffered damage, the goddess bade a wheelwright repair it,  and when he had finished told him to keep some chips as his pay. The  man was indignant at such a meagre reward, and kept only a very few of  the number; but to his surprise he found these on the morrow changed  to gold.            \"Fricka, thy wife--      This way she reins her harness of rams.      Hey! how she whirls      The golden whip;      The luckless beasts      Unboundedly bleat;      Her wheels wildly she rattles;      Wrath is lit in her look.\"                Wagner (Forman's tr.).        Eastre, the Goddess of Spring    The Saxon goddess Eastre, or Ostara, goddess of spring, whose name has  survived in the English word Easter, is also identical with Frigga,  for she too is considered goddess of the earth, or rather of Nature's  resurrection after the long death of winter. This gracious goddess  was so dearly loved by the old Teutons, that even after Christianity  had been introduced they retained so pleasant a recollection of her,  that they refused to have her degraded to the rank of a demon, like  many of their other divinities, and transferred her name to their great  Christian feast. It had long been customary to celebrate this day by  the exchange of presents of coloured eggs, for the egg is the type of  the beginning of life; so the early Christians continued to observe  this rule, declaring, however, that the egg is also symbolical of the  Resurrection. In various parts of Germany, stone altars can still be  seen, which are known as Easter-stones, because they were dedicated  to the fair goddess Ostara. They were crowned with flowers by the  young people, who danced gaily around them by the light of great  bonfires,--a species of popular games practised until the middle of  the present century, in spite of the priests' denunciations and of  the repeatedly published edicts against them.        Bertha, the White Lady    In other parts of Germany, Frigga, Holda, or Ostara is known by  the name of Brechta, Bertha, or the White Lady. She is best known  under this title in Thuringia, where she was supposed to dwell in  a hollow mountain, keeping watch over the Heimchen, souls of unborn  children, and of those who died unbaptized. Here Bertha watched over  agriculture, caring for the plants, which her infant troop watered  carefully, for each babe was supposed to carry a little jar for that  express purpose. While the goddess was duly respected and her retreat  unmolested, she remained where she was; but tradition relates that  she once left the country with her infant train dragging her plough,  and settled elsewhere to continue her kind ministrations. Bertha  is the legendary ancestress of several noble families, and she is  supposed to be the same as the industrious queen of the same name,  the mythical mother of Charlemagne, whose era has become proverbial,  for in speaking of the Golden Age in France and Germany it is customary  to say, \"in the days when Bertha spun.\"    As this Bertha is supposed to have developed a very large and flat  foot, from continually pressing the treadle of her wheel, she is  often represented in mediaeval art as a woman with a splay foot,  and hence known as la reine pedauque.    As ancestress of the imperial house of Germany, the White Lady is  supposed to appear in the palace before a death or misfortune in  the family, and this superstition is still so rife in Germany, that  the newspapers in 1884 contained the official report of a sentinel,  who declared that he had seen her flit past him in one of the palace  corridors.    As Bertha was renowned for her spinning, she naturally was regarded  as the special patroness of that branch of female industry, and was  said to flit through the streets of every village, at nightfall,  during the twelve nights between Christmas and January 6, peering  into every window to inspect the spinning of the household.    The maidens whose work had been carefully performed were rewarded by  a present of one of her own golden threads or a distaff full of extra  fine flax; but wherever a careless spinner was found, her wheel was  broken, her flax soiled, and if she had failed to honour the goddess  by eating plenty of the cakes baked at that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#11)"],[1,"the plot that was laid against  him; accordingly they called to mind what orders Cassius had given  them, and went out of the city with their swords in their hands upon the  sea-shore, where they encompassed Malichus round about, and killed him  with many wounds. Upon which Hyrcanus was immediately affrighted, till  he swooned away and fell down at the surprise he was in; and it was  with difficulty that he was recovered, when he asked who it was that had  killed Malichus. And when one of the tribunes replied that it was done  by the command of Cassius, \"Then,\" said he, \"Cassius hath saved both me  and my country, by cutting off one that was laying plots against them  both.\" Whether he spake according to his own sentiments, or whether his  fear was such that he was obliged to commend the action by saying so,  is uncertain; however, by this method Herod inflicted punishment upon  Malichus.              CHAPTER 12.           Phasaelus Is Too Hard For Felix; Herod Also Overcomes       Antigonus In Rattle; And The Jews Accuse Both Herod And       Phasaelus But Antonius Acquits Them, And Makes Them       Tetrarchs.    1. When Cassius was gone out of Syria, another sedition arose at  Jerusalem, wherein Felix assaulted Phasaelus with an army, that he might  revenge the death of Malichus upon Herod, by falling upon his brother.  Now Herod happened then to be with Fabius, the governor of Damascus,  and as he was going to his brother's assistance, he was detained by  sickness; in the mean time, Phasaelus was by himself too hard for Felix,  and reproached Hyrcanus on account of his ingratitude, both for what  assistance he had afforded Malichus, and for overlooking Malichus's  brother, when he possessed himself of the fortresses; for he had gotten  a great many of them already, and among them the strongest of them all,  Masada.    2. However, nothing could be sufficient for him against the force of  Herod, who, as soon as he was recovered, took the other fortresses  again, and drove him out of Masada in the posture of a supplicant; he  also drove away Marion, the tyrant of the Tyrians, out of Galilee, when  he had already possessed himself of three fortified places; but as to  those Tyrians whom he had caught, he preserved them all alive; nay, some  of them he gave presents to, and so sent them away, and thereby procured  good-will to himself from the city, and hatred to the tyrant. Marion had  indeed obtained that tyrannical power of Cassius, who set tyrants  over all Syria 16 and out of hatred to Herod it was that he assisted  Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, and principally on Fabius's account,  whom Antigonus had made his assistant by money, and had him accordingly  on his side when he made his descent; but it was Ptolemy, the kinsman of  Antigonus, that supplied all that he wanted.    3. When Herod had fought against these in the avenues of Judea, he  was conqueror in the battle, and drove away Antigonus, and returned to  Jerusalem, beloved by every body for the glorious action he had done;  for those who did not before favor him did join themselves to him now,  because of his marriage into the family of Hyrcanus; for as he had  formerly married a wife out of his own country of no ignoble blood,  who was called Doris, of whom he begat Antipater; so did he now marry  Mariamne, the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, and the  granddaughter of Hyrcanus, and was become thereby a relation of the  king.    4. But when Caesar and Antony had slain Cassius near Philippi, and  Caesar was gone to Italy, and Antony to Asia, amongst the rest of the  cities which sent ambassadors to Antony unto Bithynia, the great men of  the Jews came also, and accused Phasaelus and Herod, that they kept the  government by force, and that Hyrcanus had no more than an honorable  name. Herod appeared ready to answer this accusation; and having made  Antony his friend by the large sums of money which he gave him, he  brought him to such a temper as not to hear the others speak against  him; and thus did they part at this time.    5. However, after this, there came a hundred of the principal men among  the Jews to Daphne by Antioch to Antony, who was already in love with  Cleopatra to the degree of slavery; these Jews put those men that were  the most potent, both in dignity and eloquence, foremost, and accused  the brethren. 17 But Messala opposed them, and defended the brethren,  and that while Hyrcanus stood by him, on account of his relation to  them. When Antony had heard both sides, he asked Hyrcanus which party  was the fittest to govern, who replied that Herod and his party were  the fittest. Antony was glad of that answer, for he had been formerly  treated in an hospitable and obliging manner by his father Antipater,  when he marched into Judea with Gabinius; so he constituted the brethren  tetrarchs, and committed to them the government of Judea.    6. But when the ambassadors had indignation at this procedure, Antony  took fifteen of them, and put them into custody, whom he was also going  to kill presently, and the rest he drove away with disgrace; on which  occasion a still greater tumult arose at Jerusalem; so they sent again a  thousand ambassadors to Tyre, where Antony now abode, as he was marching  to Jerusalem; upon these men who made a clamor he sent out the governor  of Tyre, and ordered him to punish all that he could catch of them, and  to settle those in the administration whom he had made tetrarchs.    7. But before this, Herod and Hyrcanus went out upon the sea-shore, and  earnestly desired of these ambassadors that they would neither bring  ruin upon themselves, nor war upon their native country, by their rash  contentions; and when they grew still more outrageous, Antony sent out  armed men, and slew a great many, and wounded more of them; of whom  those that were slain were buried by Hyrcanus, as were the wounded  put under the care of physicians by him; yet would not those that  had escaped be quiet still, but put the affairs of the city into such  disorder, and so provoked Antony, that he slew those whom he had in  bonds also.              CHAPTER 13.           The Parthians Bring Antigonus Back Into Judea, And Cast       Hyrcanus And Phasaelus Into Prison. The Flight Of Herod, And       The Taking Of Jerusalem And What Hyrcanus And Phasaelus       Suffered.    1. Now two years afterward, when Barzapharnes, a governor among the  Parthians, and Paeorus, the king's son, had possessed themselves of  Syria, and when Lysanias had already succeeded upon the death of his  father Ptolemy, the son of Menneus, in the government [of Chalcis], he  prevailed with the governor, by a promise of a thousand talents, and  five hundred women, to bring back Antigonus to his kingdom, and to turn  Hyrcanus out of it. Pacorus was by these means induced so to do, and  marched along the sea-coast, while he ordered Barzapharnes to fall upon  the Jews as he went along the Mediterranean part of the country; but  of the maritime people, the Tyrians would not receive Pacorus, although  those of Ptolemais and Sidon had received him; so he committed a troop  of his horse to a certain cup-bearer belonging to the royal family,  of his own name [Pacorus], and gave him orders to march into Judea, in  order to learn the state of affairs among their enemies, and to help  Antigonus when he should want his assistance.    2. Now as these men were ravaging Carmel, many of the Jews ran together  to Antigonus, and showed themselves ready to make an incursion into  the country; so he sent them before into that place called Drymus, [the  woodland 18 ] to seize upon the place; whereupon a battle was fought  between them, and they drove the enemy away, and pursued them, and ran  after them as far as Jerusalem, and as their numbers increased, they  proceeded as far as the king's palace; but as Hyrcanus and Phasaelus  received them with a strong body of men, there happened a battle in the  market-place, in which Herod's party beat the enemy, and shut them up  in the temple, and set sixty men in the houses adjoining as a guard to  them. But the people that were tumultuous against the brethren came in,  and burnt those men; while Herod, in his rage for killing them, attacked  and slew many of the people, till one party made incursions on the other  by turns, day by day, in the way of ambushes, and slaughters were made  continually among them.    3. Now when that festival which we call Pentecost was at hand, all the  places about the temple, and the whole city, was full of a multitude of  people that were come out of the country, and which were the greatest  part of them armed also, at which time Phasaelus guarded the wall, and  Herod, with a few, guarded the royal palace; and when he made an assault  upon his enemies, as they were out of their ranks, on the north quarter  of the city, he slew a very great number of them, and put them all to  flight; and some of them he shut up within the city, and others within  the outward rampart. In the mean time, Antigonus desired that Pacorus  might be admitted to be a reconciler between them; and Phasaelus was  prevailed upon to admit the Parthian into the city with five hundred  horse, and to treat him in an hospitable manner, who pretended that he  came to quell the tumult, but in reality he came to assist Antigonus;  however, he laid a plot for Phasaelus, and persuaded him to go as an  ambassador to Barzapharnes, in order to put an end to the war, although  Herod was very earnest with him to the contrary, and exhorted him to  kill the plotter, but not expose himself to the snares he had laid for  him, because the barbarians are naturally perfidious. However,  Pacorus went out and took Hyrcanus with him, that he might be the less  suspected; he also 19 left some of the horsemen, called the Freemen,  with Herod, and conducted Phasaelus with the rest.    4. But now, when they were come to Galilee, they found that "]]]
