Again she struck out, but slowly--oh so slowly now. And when at last she  reached the lee of the tall reeds, her limbs were numbed, her strength  spent, her brave little heart was sinking, and she cared no more whether  the fox were there or not. Through the reeds she did indeed pass, but  once in the weeds her course wavered and slowed, her feeble strokes  no longer sent her landward, the ice forming around her stopped her  altogether. In a little while the cold, weak limbs ceased to move, the  furry nose-tip of the little mother Cottontail wobbled no more, and the  soft brown eyes were closed in death.    But there was no fox waiting to tear her with ravenous jaws. Rag had  escaped the first onset of the foe, and as soon as he regained his wits  he came running back to change-off and so help his mother. He met the  old fox going round the pond to meet Molly and led him far and away,  then dismissed him with a barbed-wire gash on his head, and came to the  bank and sought about and trailed and thumped, but all his searching was  in vain; he could not find his little mother. He never saw her again,  and he never knew whither she went, for she slept her never-waking sleep  in the ice-arms of her friend the Water that tells no tales.    Poor little Molly Cottontail! She was a true heroine, yet only one of  unnumbered millions that without a thought of heroism have lived and  done their best in their little world, and died. She fought a good fight  in the battle of life. She was good stuff; the stuff that never dies.  For flesh of her flesh and brain of her brain was Rag. She lives in him,  and through him transmits a finer fibre to her race.    And Rag still lives in the Swamp. Old Olifant died that winter, and the  unthrifty sons ceased to clear the Swamp or mend the wire fences. Within  a single year it was a wilder place than ever; fresh trees and brambles  grew, and falling wires made many Cottontail castles and last retreats  that dogs and foxes dared not storm. And there to this day lives Rag. He  is a big strong buck now and fears no rivals. He has a large family of  his own, and a pretty brown wife that he got I know not where. There,  no doubt, he and his children's children will flourish for many years  to come, and there you may see them any sunny evening if you have learnt  their signal 5 code, and, choosing a good spot on the ground, know just  how and when to thump it.                              BINGO         \"Ye Franckelyn's dogge leaped over a style,       And yey yclept him lyttel Bingo,        B-I-N-G-O,         And yey yclept him lyttel Bingo.

Now ys not this a prettye rhyme,       I thynke ytte ys bye Jingo,        J-I-N-G-O,         I thynke ytte ys bye Jingo.\"          BINGO, The Story of My Dog    I    IT WAS EARLY in November, 1882, and the Manitoba winter had just set in.  I was tilting back in my chair for a few lazy moments after breakfast,  idly alternating my gaze from the one window-pane of our shanty, through  which was framed a bit of the prairie and the end of our cowshed, to the  old rhyme of the 'Franckelyn's dogge' pinned on the logs near by. But  the dreamy mixture of rhyme and view was quickly dispelled by the sight  of a large gray animal dashing across the prairie into the cowshed, with  a smaller black and white animal in hot pursuit.    \"A wolf,\" I exclaimed, and seizing a rifle dashed out to help the dog.  But before I could get there they had left the stable, and after a  short run over the snow the wolf again turned at bay, and the dog, our  neighbor's collie, circled about watching his chance to snap.    I fired a couple of long shots, which had the effect only of setting  them off again over the prairie. After another run this matchless dog  closed and seized the wolf by the haunch, but again retreated to avoid  the fierce return chop. Then there was another stand at bay, and again a  race over the snow. Every few hundred yards this scene was repeated, the  dog managing so that each fresh rush should be toward the settlement,  while the wolf vainly tried to break back toward the dark belt of  trees in the east. At last after a mile of this fighting and running I  overtook them, and the dog, seeing that he now had good backing, closed  in for the finish.    After a few seconds the whirl of struggling animals resolved itself into  a wolf, on his back, with a bleeding collie gripping his throat, and  it was now easy for me to step up and end the fight by putting a ball  through the wolf's head.    Then, when this dog of marvellous wind saw that his foe was dead, he  gave him no second glance, but set out at a lope for a farm four miles  across the snow where he had left his master when first the wolf  was started. He was a wonderful dog, and even if I had not come he  undoubtedly would have killed the wolf alone, as I learned he had  already done with others of the kind, in spite of the fact that the  wolf, though of the smaller or prairie race, was much larger than  himself. I was filled with admiration for the dog's prowess and at once  sought to buy him at any price. The scornful reply of his owner was,  \"Why don't you try to buy one of the children?\"    Since Frank was not in the market I was obliged to content myself with  the next best thing, one of his alleged progeny. That is, a son of his  wife. This probable offspring of an illustrious sire was a roly-poly  ball of black fur that looked more like a long-tailed bearcub than a  puppy. But he had some tan markings like those on Frank's coat,  that were, I hoped, guarantees of future greatness, and also a very  characteristic ring of white that he always wore on his muzzle.    Having got possession of his person, the next thing was to find him  a name. Surely this puzzle was already solved. The rhyme of the  'Franckelyn's dogge' was in-built with the foundation of our  acquaintance, so with adequate pomp 'we yclept him little Bingo.'    II    The rest of that winter Bingo spent in our shanty, living the life of a  blubbery, fat, well-meaning, ill-doing puppy; gorging himself with food  and growing bigger and clumsier each day. Even sad experience failed  to teach him that he must keep his nose out of the rat trap. His most  friendly overtures to the cat were wholly misunderstood and resulted  only in an armed neutrality that varied by occasional reigns of terror,  continued to the end; which came when Bingo, who early showed a mind of  his own, got a notion for sleeping at the barn and avoiding the shanty  altogether.    When the spring came I set about his serious education. After much pains  on my behalf and many pains on his, he learned to go at the word in  quest of our old yellow cow, that pastured at will on the unfenced  prairie.    Once he had learned his business, he became very fond of it and nothing  pleased him more than an order to go and fetch the cow. Away he would  dash, barking with pleasure and leaping high in the air that he might  better scan the plain for his victim. In a short time he would return  driving her at full gallop before him, and gave her no peace until,  puffing and blowing, she was safely driven into the farthest corner of  her stable.    Less energy on his part would have been more satisfactory, but we bore  with him until he grew so fond of this semi-daily hunt that he began to  bring 'old Dunne' without being told. And at length not once or twice  but a dozen times a day this energetic cowherd would sally forth on his  own responsibility and drive the cow home to the stable.    At last things came to such a pass that whenever he felt like taking a  little exercise, or had a few minutes of spare time, or even happened to  think of it, Bingo would sally forth at racing speed over the plain  and a few minutes later return, driving the unhappy yellow cow at full  gallop before him.    At first this did not seem very bad, as it kept the cow from straying  too far; but soon it was seen that it hindered her feeding. She became  thin and gave less milk; it seemed to weigh on her mind too, as she  was always watching nervously for that hateful dog, and in the mornings  would hang around the stable as though afraid to venture off and subject  herself at once to an onset.    This was going too far. All attempts to make Bingo more moderate in his  pleasure were failures, so he was compelled to give it up altogether.  After this, though he dared not bring her home, he continued to show his  interest by lying at her stable door while she was being milked.    As the summer came on the mosquitoes became a dreadful plague, and the  consequent vicious switching of Dunne's tail at milking-time was even  more annoying than the mosquitoes.    Fred, the brother who did the milking, was of an inventive as well as  an impatient turn of mind, and he devised a simple plan to stop the  switching. He fastened a brick to the cow's tail, then set blithely  about his work assured of unusual comfort while the rest of us looked on  in doubt.    Suddenly through the mist of mosquitoes came a dull whack and an  outburst of 'language.' The cow went on placidly chewing till Fred got  on his feet and furiously attacked her with the milking-stool. It was  bad enough to be whacked on the ear with a brick by a stupid old cow,  but the uproarious enjoyment and ridicule of the bystanders made it  unendurable.    Bingo, hearing the uproar, and divining that he was needed, rushed in  and attacked Dunne on the other side. Before the affair quieted down the  milk was spilt, the pail and stool were broken, and the cow and the dog  severely beaten.    Poor Bingo could not understand it at all. He had long ago learned to  despise that cow, and now in utter disgust he decided to forsake even  her stable door, and from that time be attached"]]]
