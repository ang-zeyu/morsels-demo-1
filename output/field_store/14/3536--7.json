He will be able  to help you in a thousand ways, and when in need of him you have only  to walk out on the moorland without once looking behind you, and to  say:      'Dappled Horse with Mane of Gold,    Horse of Wonder! Come to me.    Walk not the earth, for I am told    You fly like birds o'er land and sea.'    Finish your work of mercy by burying me here, so that I may be at rest  until the day of judgment. Then depart in peace and be of good cheer.\"    The prince dug a hole at the foot of a tree, and reverently buried the  skull, repeating over it the prayers for the dead. Just as he finished  he saw a small blue flame come out of the skull and fly towards  heaven: it was the soul of the dead man on its way to the angels.    The prince made the sign of the cross and resumed his journey. When he  had gone some way along the moorland he stopped, and without looking  back tried the effect of the magic words, saying:      \"Dappled Horse with Mane of Gold,    Horse of Wonder! Come to me.    Walk not the earth, for I am told    You fly like birds o'er land and sea.\"    Then amid flash of lightning and roll of thunder appeared the horse. A  horse, do I say? Why, he was a miracle of wonder. He was light as air,  with dappled coat and golden mane. Flames came from his nostrils and  sparks from his eyes. Volumes of steam rolled from his mouth and  clouds of smoke issued from his ears. He stopped before the prince,  and said in a human voice, \"What are your orders, Prince Dobrotek?\"    \"I am in great trouble,\" answered the prince, \"and shall be glad if  you can help me.\" Then he told all that had happened.    And the horse said, \"Enter in at my left ear, and come out at my  right.\"    The prince obeyed, and came out at the right ear clad in a suit of  splendid armour. His gilded cuirass, his steel helmet inlaid with  gold, and his sword and club made of him a complete warrior. Still  more, he felt himself endowed with superhuman strength and bravery.  When he stamped his foot and shouted the earth trembled and gave forth  a sound like thunder, the very leaves fell from the trees.    [Illustration]    \"What must we do? Where are we to go?\" he asked.    The horse replied, \"Your bride, Princess Pietnotka, has been carried  off by the Dwarf with the Long Beard, whose hump weighs two hundred  and eighty pounds. This powerful magician must be defeated, but he  lives a long way from here, and nothing can touch or wound him except  the sharp smiting sword that belongs to his own brother, a monster  with the head and eyes of a basilisk. We must first attack the  brother.\"    Prince Dobrotek leaped on to the dappled horse, which was covered with  golden trappings, and they set off immediately, clearing mountains,  penetrating forests, crossing rivers; and so light was the steed's  step that he galloped over the grass without bending a single blade,  and along sandy roads without raising a grain of dust. At last they  reached a vast plain, strewn with human bones. They stopped in front  of a huge moving mountain, and the horse said:    \"Prince, this moving mountain that you see before you is the head of  the Monster with Basilisk Eyes, and the bones that whiten the ground  are the skeletons of his victims, so beware of the eyes that deal  death. The heat of the midday sun has made the giant sleep, and the  sword with the never-failing blade lies there before him. Bend down  and lie along my neck until we are near enough, then seize the sword  and you have nothing more to fear. For, without the sword, not only  will the monster be unable to harm you, but he himself will be  completely at your mercy.\"    The horse then noiselessly approached the huge creature, upon which  the prince bent down, and quickly picked up the sword. Then, raising  himself on his steed's back, he gave a \"Hurrah!\" loud enough to wake  the dead. The giant lifted his head, yawned, and turned his  bloodthirsty eyes upon the prince; but seeing the sword in his hand he  became quiet, and said, \"Knight, is it weariness of life that brings  you here?\"    \"Boast not,\" replied the prince, \"you are in my power. Your glance has  already lost its magic charm, and you will soon have to die by this  sword. But first tell me who you are.\"    \"It is true, prince, I am in your hands, but be generous, I deserve  your pity. I am a knight of the race of giants, and if it were not for  the wickedness of my brother I should have lived in peace. He is the  horrible dwarf with the great hump and the beard seven feet long. He  was jealous of my fine figure, and tried to do me an injury. You must  know that all his strength, which is extraordinary, lies in his beard,  and it can only be cut off by the sword you hold in your hand. One day  he came to me and said, 'Dear brother, I pray you help me to discover  the sharp smiting sword that has been hidden in the earth by a  magician. He is our enemy, and he alone can destroy us both.' Fool  that I was, I believed him, and by means of a large oak tree, raked up  the mountain and found the sword. Then we disputed as to which of us  should have it, and at last my brother suggested that we should cease  quarrelling and decide by lot. 'Let us each put an ear to the ground,  and the sword shall belong to him who first hears the bells of yonder  church,' said he. I placed my ear to the ground at once, and my  brother treacherously cut off my head with the sword. My body, left  unburied, became a great mountain, which is now overgrown with  forests. As for my head, it is full of a life and strength proof  against all dangers, and has remained here ever since to frighten all  who attempt to take away the sword. Now, prince, I beg of you, use the  sword to cut off the beard of my wicked brother; kill him, and return  here to put an end to me: I shall die happy if I die avenged.\"    \"That you shall be, and very soon, I promise you,\" replied his  listener.    The prince bade the Dappled Horse with Golden Mane carry him to the  kingdom of the Dwarf with the Long Beard. They reached the garden gate  at the very moment when the dwarf had caught sight of Princess  Pietnotka and was running after her. The war-trumpet, challenging him  to fight, had obliged him to leave her, which he did, having first put  on her head the invisible cap.    While the prince was awaiting the answer to his challenge he heard a  great noise in the clouds, and looking up saw the dwarf preparing to  aim at him from a great height. But he missed his aim and fell to the  ground so heavily that his body was half buried in the earth. The  prince seized him by the beard, which he at once cut off with the  sharp smiting sword.    Then he fastened the dwarf to the saddle, put the beard in his helmet,  and entered the palace. When the servants saw that he had really got  possession of the terrible beard, they opened all the doors to give  him entrance. Without losing a moment he began his search for Princess  Pietnotka. For a long time he was unsuccessful, and was almost in  despair when he came across her accidentally, and, without knowing it,  knocked off the invisible cap. He saw his lovely bride sound asleep,  and being unable to wake her he put the cap in his pocket, took her in  his arms, and, mounting his steed, set off to return to the Monster  with the Basilisk Eyes. The giant swallowed the dwarf at one mouthful,  and the prince cut the monster's head up into a thousand pieces, which  he scattered all over the plain.    He then resumed his journey, and on coming to the moorland the dappled  horse stopped short and said, \"Prince, here for the present we must  take leave of each other. You are not far from home, your own horse  awaits you; but before leaving, enter in at my right ear and come out  at my left.\"    The prince did so, and came out without his armour, and clad as when  Pietnotka left him.    The dappled horse vanished, and Dobrotek whistled to his own horse,  who ran up, quite pleased to see him again. They immediately set off  for the king's palace.    But night came on before they reached the end of their journey.    The prince laid the sleeping maiden on the grass, and, covering her up  carefully to keep her warm, he himself fell fast asleep. By chance, a  knight, one of her suitors, passed that way. Seeing Dobrotek asleep he  drew his sword and stabbed him; then he lifted the princess on his  horse and soon reached the king's palace, where he addressed  Pietnotka's father in these words: \"Here is your daughter, whom I now  claim as my wife, for it is I who have restored her to you. She was  carried off by a terrible sorcerer who fought with me three days and  three nights. But I conquered him, and I have brought you the princess  safely back.\"    [Illustration]    The king was overjoyed at seeing her again, but finding that his  tenderest efforts were powerless to awake her, he wanted to know the  reason of it.    \"That I cannot tell you,\" replied the impostor; \"you see her as I  found her myself.\"    Meanwhile, poor Prince Dobrotek, seriously wounded, was slowly  recovering consciousness, but he felt so weak that he could hardly  utter these words:      \"Come, Magic Horse with Mane of Gold,    Come, Dappled Horse, O come to me.    Fly like the birds as you did of old,    As flashes of lightning o'er land and sea.\"    Instantly a bright cloud appeared, and from the midst thereof stepped  the magic horse. As he already knew all that had happened, he dashed  off immediately to the Mountain of Eternal Life. Thence he drew the  three kinds of water: the Water that gives Life, the Water that Cures,  and the Water that Strengthens. Returning to the prince, he sprinkled  him first with the Life-giving Water, and instantly the body, which  had become cold, was warm again and the blood began to circulate. The  Water that Cures healed the wound,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#11)"],[1,"roups. In the cloven-hoofed forms, a single toe first  disappeared, leaving but four; then the two outer of these were aborted,  leaving two nearly equal digits. In the series of the horse, where we  can trace the change more clearly, we find the earliest form five-toed,  but the outer and inner digit shrunken so as to become of little use.  This condition of the creature in the early Tertiaries gives us the  beginning of the equine series, and shows that far away as the creature  is now from ourselves, it originated from the main stem of mammalian  life, from which our own forms have sprung. In the next higher stage in  time, and likewise in development, we find these lessened toes at their  vanishing point, and two of the remaining digits, lying on either side  of what corresponds to the middle finger in our own hands, beginning to  shrink in length and volume, while the central toe becomes larger and  stronger than before. Last in the series we come to our ordinary equine  form, in which nothing is left but the single massive extremity, though  the remnants of two of the toes can be traced in the form of slender  bones known as splints, which are altogether enclosed within the skin  which wraps the region about the fetlock joints.    As if it were to show to us the history of this marvellous organic  achievement, nature now and then, though seldom--perhaps not oftener  than one in ten million instances--sends forth a horse with three hoofs  to each leg. Two of these are small and lie on either side of the  functioning extremity. Each of these hoofs is connected with a  splint-bone which has in some way suddenly become reminded of its  ancient use, and develops in a manner to imitate the creatures which  passed from the earth millions of years ago. In most cases the  splint-bones have no function whatever to perform. They are indeed  superfluous and injurious parts, and are likely from time to time to be  worse than useless, becoming the seats of disease. In this beautiful  instance, perhaps the fairest of all those showing how the highly  developed forms of our time retain a memory of their ancestral life, we  see how the advance in the series of the horse has been effected against  the resistance ancient organic habit opposes to all gains. We can  therefore the better understand how the building of the hoof represents  the labor of geologic ages during which the slow-made gains were won.    In its present elaborate form, the hoof of a horse is the most perfect  instrument of support which has been devised in the animal kingdom to  uphold a large and swiftly moving animal in its passage over the  ground. The original toe-nail, and the neighboring soft parts connected  with it, have been modified into a structure which in an extraordinary  manner combines solidity with elasticity, so that it may strike violent  blows upon the hard surface of the earth without harm. The bones of the  toe to which it is affixed have enlarged with the progressive loss of  their neighbors of the extremity, until they fairly continue the  dimensions of the bony parts of the leg. Moreover, they have lengthened  out, so as to give the limb a great extension, and this, in turn,  magnifies the stride which the creature can take in running. The result  is that the horse can carry a greater weight at a swifter speed than  any other animal approaching it in size.    [Illustration: On Rotten Row, Hyde Park, London]    The needs which led, in a slow accumulative way, to the invention of  the admirable contrivance of the horse's foot, were doubtless founded  on the necessities of swift movement in fleeing from the great  predaceous animals. Incidentally, however, as this development has  gone on, the peculiarities of the extremity have proved highly  advantageous in defence, and the creatures have acquired certain  peculiar ways of using their feet effectively to this end. The solid  character of the hoof, its considerable weight, and the great power  of the muscles of the hams, which are the principal agents in  propelling the animal, make the hind feet capable of delivering a  very powerful blow. The measure of its efficiency may be judged from  the fact that a lion has been slain by a stroke from the foot of a  donkey, and in their wild state a herd of horses with their heads  together, can beat off the attack of the most powerful beasts of  prey. In using the hind feet for assault or defence, horses have  adopted an effective method of kicking which is unknown among other  animals. Resting on their fore-legs, the hinder feet are thrown  backward and upward, so that they may strike a blow six feet from the  ground. Many of our cloven-footed animals have learned to strike  cutting blows with the sharp hoofs of their fore-limbs--our bulls  will stamp a fallen enemy with great force; but the backward kick of  the horse is a peculiar movement, and is distinctly related to the  peculiar structure of the animal's extremities.    It is an interesting fact that the development of a long and slowly  elaborated series leading to the making of the horse appears to have  taken place mainly, if not altogether, in the region about the  headwaters of the Missouri River. In the olden days when this great work  was done, that part of our continent was a well-watered country, much of  its surface being occupied by great lakes which have long since  disappeared. In the deposits accumulated in these bodies of fresh water  are found the bones of the olden species telling the history of their  series. It is not yet certain that the final step of the accomplishment  which gave us our existing species was effected in this land. It seems  indeed most likely that the ancestral form of our domesticated horses  found their way to the continents of the Old World, and there underwent  the last slight changes, before they were made captive by man. If there  ever were perfect horses on this continent, they had passed away from  its area before the coming of man to the land. The history of our  aborigines would have been quite other than it has been, if they had  had a chance to win the assistance of this noble helpmeet.    Central Asia appears to have been the domicile of the horse when he  first began his acquaintance with our kind. We do not know the  original form of the creature. The wild horses existing at the  present day in that part of the world, and which plentifully occur  in other regions whereunto they have been taken by man, appear to  have been set free from captivity.    [Illustration: Horse of a Bulgarian Marauder]    The first domestication of the horse appears to have been brought  about, at an early time in the history of our race, in northern Asia.  The time when this feat was accomplished antedates our records. The  creature may first have come into possession of the Tartar tribes,  but it quickly passed over Asia and Europe and shortly became the  mainstay of the Aryan and Semitic folk. None other of our  domesticated forms has been disseminated with like rapidity, or at  the outset with as little change in its original features. From the  first the horse seems to have been mainly used as a saddle and pack  animal. It has never served in any considerable measure for food. The  failure to make use of the flesh of this animal appears to be common  to most of the savage or barbaric people who keep horses, and has been  transmitted in a singularly definite way to all civilized folk. The  origin of such a prejudice, despite the fact that the flesh of the  horse is of excellent quality, can only be explained through the  sympathetic motives common to all men. Their association with the  horse, as with the dog, is so intimate as to make the use of these  animals in the form of food more or less repugnant. In a small though  unimportant way, mares have been used for milk, and there seems no  reason to doubt that, if they had been carefully bred for this purpose,  they might have been as serviceable as the cow. It may be that the  failure to use the milk of the horse is to be accounted for on the  same ground as the dislike to its flesh.    The horse was probably at first most valued for its use in war. The  peoples which possessed it certainly had a great advantage over their  less well provided neighbors. In fact the development of the military  art, as distinguished from the mere fighting of savages, was made easy  by the strength, endurance, fleetness, and measure of bravery  characterizing this creature. In the wide range of species which have  been domesticated or might be won to companionship with man, there is  none other which so completely supplements the imperfect human body,  making it fit for great deeds. If the horse had been much smaller or  larger than he is, he would have been far less serviceable to man. It  was a most fortunate accident that the creature came to us with the  proportions which insured a high measure of utility in various lines  of activity. The elephant has been found too large for agricultural  uses, and too powerful to be controlled by the will and force of his  master under conditions of excitement.    [Illustration: Mare and Foal]    Those peoples which early acquired the resources in the way of  strength and fleetness which the horse put at their disposition,  became inevitably the conquerors of the folk who were denied these  advantages. If we consider the conditions which have led to the  domination of the world by the Aryan and Semitic people, and the  races which they have affiliated with them, we readily discern the  fact that they have, to a great extent, won by horse-power rather  than by their own physical strength. Thus equipped by their able  servants, they have pressed outward from their ancient realms and  have in a way overridden the tribes which were unmounted.    So imposing is the effect of the horsed man on all peoples who are  without previous knowledge of the united creatures, that it always"]]]
