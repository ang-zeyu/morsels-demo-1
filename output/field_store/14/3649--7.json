CHORUS  Bowls thou wilt find, the carver's handiwork;  Crown thou the rims and both the handles crown--    OEDIPUS  With olive shoots or blocks of wool, or how?    CHORUS  With wool from fleece of yearling freshly shorn.    OEDIPUS  What next? how must I end the ritual?    CHORUS  Pour thy libation, turning to the dawn.    OEDIPUS  Pouring it from the urns whereof ye spake?    CHORUS  Yea, in three streams; and be the last bowl drained  To the last drop.    OEDIPUS                      And wherewith shall I fill it,  Ere in its place I set it?  This too tell.    CHORUS  With water and with honey; add no wine.    OEDIPUS  And when the embowered earth hath drunk thereof?    CHORUS  Then lay upon it thrice nine olive sprays  With both thy hands, and offer up this prayer.    OEDIPUS  I fain would hear it; that imports the most.    CHORUS  That, as we call them Gracious, they would deign  To grant the suppliant their saving grace.  So pray thyself or whoso pray for thee,  In whispered accents, not with lifted voice;  Then go and look back.  Do as I bid,  And I shall then be bold to stand thy friend;  Else, stranger, I should have my fears for thee.    OEDIPUS  Hear ye, my daughters, what these strangers say?    ANTIGONE  We listened, and attend thy bidding, father.    OEDIPUS  I cannot go, disabled as I am  Doubly, by lack of strength and lack of sight;  But one of you may do it in my stead;  For one, I trow, may pay the sacrifice  Of thousands, if his heart be leal and true.  So to your work with speed, but leave me not  Untended; for this frame is all too week  To move without the help of guiding hand.    ISMENE  Then I will go perform these rites, but where  To find the spot, this have I yet to learn.    CHORUS  Beyond this grove; if thou hast need of aught,  The guardian of the close will lend his aid.    ISMENE  I go, and thou, Antigone, meanwhile  Must guard our father.  In a parent's cause  Toil, if there be toil, is of no account.  [Exit ISMENE]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Ill it is, stranger, to awake  Pain that long since has ceased to ache,  And yet I fain would hear--    OEDIPUS  What thing?    CHORUS  Thy tale of cruel suffering  For which no cure was found,  The fate that held thee bound.    OEDIPUS  O bid me not (as guest I claim  This grace) expose my shame.    CHORUS  The tale is bruited far and near,  And echoes still from ear to ear.  The truth, I fain would hear.    OEDIPUS  Ah me!    CHORUS       I prithee yield.    OEDIPUS                      Ah me!    CHORUS  Grant my request, I granted all to thee.    OEDIPUS  (Ant. 1)  Know then I suffered ills most vile, but none  (So help me Heaven!) from acts in malice done.    CHORUS  Say how.    OEDIPUS            The State around  An all unwitting bridegroom bound  An impious marriage chain;            That was my bane.    CHORUS  Didst thou in sooth then share  A bed incestuous with her that bare--    OEDIPUS  It stabs me like a sword,  That two-edged word,  O stranger, but these maids--my own--    CHORUS  Say on.    OEDIPUS  Two daughters, curses twain.    CHORUS  Oh God!    OEDIPUS  Sprang from the wife and mother's travail-pain.    CHORUS  (Str. 2)  What, then thy offspring are at once--    OEDIPUS                                          Too true.  Their father's very sister's too.    CHORUS  Oh horror!    OEDIPUS            Horrors from the boundless deep  Back on my soul in refluent surges sweep.    CHORUS  Thou hast endured--    OEDIPUS                      Intolerable woe.    CHORUS  And sinned--    OEDIPUS                 I sinned not.    CHORUS                                How so?    OEDIPUS  I served the State; would I had never won  That graceless grace by which I was undone.    CHORUS  (Ant. 2)  And next, unhappy man, thou hast shed blood?    OEDIPUS  Must ye hear more?    CHORUS                      A father's?    OEDIPUS                                     Flood on flood  Whelms me; that word's a second mortal blow.    CHORUS  Murderer!    OEDIPUS            Yes, a murderer, but know--    CHORUS  What canst thou plead?    OEDIPUS                           A plea of justice.    CHORUS                                               How?    OEDIPUS  I slew who else would me have slain;  I slew without intent,  A wretch, but innocent  In the law's eye, I stand, without a stain.    CHORUS  Behold our sovereign, Theseus, Aegeus' son,  Comes at thy summons to perform his part.  [Enter THESEUS]    THESEUS  Oft had I heard of thee in times gone by--  The bloody mutilation of thine eyes--  And therefore know thee, son of Laius.  All that I lately gathered on the way  Made my conjecture doubly sure; and now  Thy garb and that marred visage prove to me  That thou art he.  So pitying thine estate,  Most ill-starred Oedipus, I fain would know  What is the suit ye urge on me and Athens,  Thou and the helpless maiden at thy side.  Declare it; dire indeed must be the tale  Whereat _I_ should recoil.  I too was reared,  Like thee, in exile, and in foreign lands  Wrestled with many perils, no man more.  Wherefore no alien in adversity  Shall seek in vain my succor, nor shalt thou;  I know myself a mortal, and my share  In what the morrow brings no more than thine.    OEDIPUS  Theseus, thy words so apt, so generous  So comfortable, need no long reply  Both who I am and of what lineage sprung,  And from what land I came, thou hast declared.  So without prologue I may utter now  My brief petition, and the tale is told.    THESEUS  Say on, and tell me what I fain would learn.    OEDIPUS  I come to offer thee this woe-worn frame,  A gift not fair to look on; yet its worth  More precious far than any outward show.    THESEUS  What profit dost thou proffer to have brought?    OEDIPUS  Hereafter thou shalt learn, not yet, methinks.    THESEUS  When may we hope to reap the benefit?    OEDIPUS  When I am dead and thou hast buried me.    THESEUS  Thou cravest life's last service; all before--  Is it forgotten or of no account?    OEDIPUS  Yea, the last boon is warrant for the rest.    THESEUS  The grace thou cravest then is small indeed.    OEDIPUS  Nay, weigh it well; the issue is not slight.    THESEUS  Thou meanest that betwixt thy sons and me?    OEDIPUS  Prince, they would fain convey me back to Thebes.    THESEUS  If there be no compulsion, then methinks  To rest in banishment befits not thee.    OEDIPUS  Nay, when _I_ wished it _they_ would not consent.    THESEUS  For shame! such temper misbecomes the faller.    OEDIPUS  Chide if thou wilt, but first attend my plea.    THESEUS  Say on, I wait full knowledge ere I judge.    OEDIPUS  O Theseus, I have suffered wrongs on wrongs.    THESEUS  Wouldst tell the old misfortune of thy race?    OEDIPUS  No, that has grown a byword throughout Greece.    THESEUS  What then can be this more than mortal grief?    OEDIPUS  My case stands thus; by my own flesh and blood  I was expelled my country, and can ne'er  Thither return again, a parricide.    THESEUS  Why fetch thee home if thou must needs obey.    THESEUS  What are they threatened by the oracle?    OEDIPUS  Destruction that awaits them in this land.    THESEUS  What can beget ill blood 'twixt them and me?    OEDIPUS  Dear son of Aegeus, to the gods alone  Is given immunity from eld and death;  But nothing else escapes all-ruinous time.  Earth's might decays, the might of men decays,  Honor grows cold, dishonor flourishes,  There is no constancy 'twixt friend and friend,  Or city and city; be it soon or late,  Sweet turns to bitter, hate once more to love.  If now 'tis sunshine betwixt Thebes and thee  And not a cloud, Time in his endless course  Gives birth to endless days and nights, wherein  The merest nothing shall suffice to cut  With serried spears your bonds of amity.  Then shall my slumbering and buried corpse  In its cold grave drink their warm life-blood up,  If Zeus be Zeus and Phoebus still speak true.  No more:  'tis ill to tear aside the veil  Of mysteries; let me cease as I began:  Enough if thou wilt keep thy plighted troth,  Then shall thou ne'er complain that Oedipus  Proved an unprofitable and thankless guest,  Except the gods themselves shall play me false.    CHORUS  The man, my lord, has from the very first  Declared his power to offer to our land  These and like benefits.    THESEUS                           Who could reject  The proffered amity of such a friend?  First, he can claim the hospitality  To which by mutual contract we stand pledged:  Next, coming here, a suppliant to the gods,  He pays full tribute to the State and me;  His favors therefore never will I spurn,  But grant him the full rights of citizen;  And, if it suits the stranger here to bide,  I place him in your charge, or if he please  Rather to come with me--choose, Oedipus,  Which of the two thou wilt.  Thy choice is mine.    OEDIPUS  Zeus, may the blessing fall on men like these!    THESEUS  What dost thou then decide--to come with me?    OEDIPUS  Yea, were it lawful--but 'tis rather here--    THESEUS  What wouldst thou here?  I shall not thwart thy wish.    OEDIPUS  Here shall I vanquish those who cast me forth.    THESEUS  Then were thy presence here a boon indeed.    OEDIPUS  Such shall it prove, if thou fulfill'st thy pledge.    THESEUS  Fear not for me; I shall not play thee false.    OEDIPUS  No need to back thy promise with an oath.    THESEUS  An oath would be no surer than my word.    OEDIPUS  How wilt thou act then?    THESEUS                           What is it thou fear'st?    OEDIPUS  My foes will come--    THESEUS                      Our friends will look to that.    OEDIPUS  But if thou leave me?    THESEUS                      Teach me not my duty.    OEDIPUS  'Tis fear constrains me.    THESEUS                           _My_ soul knows no fear!    OEDIPUS  Thou knowest not what threats--    THESEUS                                I know that none  Shall hale thee hence in my despite.
