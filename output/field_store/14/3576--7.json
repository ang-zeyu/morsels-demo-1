HF - high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to 30,000-kHz  range.  Inmarsat - International Maritime Satellite Organization (London);  provider of global mobile satellite communications for commercial,  distress, and safety applications at sea, in the air, and on land.  Intelsat - International Telecommunications Satellite Organization  (Washington, DC).  Intersputnik - International Organization of Space Communications  (Moscow); first established in the former Soviet Union and the East  European countries, it is now marketing its services worldwide with  earth stations in North America, Africa, and East Asia.  landline - communication wire or cable of any sort that is installed on  poles or buried in the ground.  Marecs - Maritime European Communications Satellite used in the  Inmarsat system on lease from the European Space Agency.  Marisat - satellites of the Comsat Corporation that participate in the  Inmarsat system.  Medarabtel - the Middle East Telecommunications Project of the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU) providing a modern  telecommunications network, primarily by microwave radio relay, linking  Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia,  Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen; it was initially started in  Morocco in 1970 by the Arab Telecommunications Union (ATU) and was  known at that time as the Middle East Mediterranean Telecommunications  Network.  microwave radio relay - transmission of long distance telephone calls  and television programs by highly directional radio microwaves that are  received and sent on from one booster station to another on an optical  path.  NMT - Nordic Mobile Telephone; an analog cellular telephone system that  was developed jointly by the national telecommunications authorities of  the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden).  Orbita - a Russian television service; also the trade name of a packet-  switched digital telephone network.  radiotelephone communications - the two-way transmission and reception  of sounds by broadcast radio on authorized frequencies using telephone  handsets.  PanAmSat - PanAmSat Corporation (Greenwich, CT).  SAFE - South African Far East Cable  satellite communication system - a communication system consisting of  two or more earth stations and at least one satellite that provide long  distance transmission of voice, data, and television; the system  usually serves as a trunk connection between telephone exchanges; if  the earth stations are in the same country, it is a domestic system.  satellite earth station - a communications facility with a microwave  radio transmitting and receiving antenna and required receiving and  transmitting equipment for communicating with satellites.  satellite link - a radio connection between a satellite and an earth  station permitting communication between them, either one-way (down  link from satellite to earth station - television receive-only  transmission) or two-way (telephone channels).  SHF - super high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to  30,000-MHz range.  shortwave - radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall above  the commercial broadcast band and are used for communication over long  distances.  Solidaridad - geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of  international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.

UHF - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to 3,000-  MHz range.  VHF - very high frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz  range.    Telephones - main lines in use  This entry gives the total number of main telephone lines in use.    Telephones - mobile cellular  This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephones in use.    Television broadcast stations  This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus  any repeater stations.    Terminology  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word Country  in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies,  areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities  in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.  Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense,  security, and defense activities in many entries. The Independence  entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling  states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency  status noted in this same entry.    Terrain  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Total fertility rate  This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each  age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct measure of the  level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births  per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population change in  the country. A rate of two children per woman is considered the  replacement rate for a population, resulting in relative stability in  terms of total numbers. Rates above two children indicate populations  growing in size and whose median age is declining. Higher rates may  also indicate difficulties for families, in some situations, to feed  and educate their children and for women to enter the labor force.  Rates below two children indicate populations decreasing in size and  growing older. Global fertility rates are in general decline and this  trend is most pronounced in industrialized countries, especially  Western Europe, where populations are projected to decline dramatically  over the next 50 years.    Transnational issues  This category includes three entries - Disputes - international,  Refugees and internally displaced persons, and Illicit drugs - that  deal with current issues going beyond national boundaries.    Transportation  This category includes the entries dealing with the means for movement  of people and goods.    Transportation - note  This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Unemployment rate  This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without  jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Waterways  This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers, canals, and  other inland bodies of water.    Years  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as  fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting period of 12  months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is an accounting  period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.

Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,  contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong.  Intelligence is information that has been collected, integrated,  evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the  final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the  policymaker.    The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports  on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.  The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation  on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence  continually updates the  inventory of knowledge; and estimative  intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue  prospects for guidance of basic and  current intelligence. The World  Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence  Estimates are examples of the three types of finished "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],[0,"Vaninka (#11)"],[1," another glass of  brandy.    \"I meant to say happier,\" said Ivan quickly.    \"It is difficult to prove that,\" said Gregory doubtingly.    \"Why difficult? Our masters, the moment they are born, are put into the  hands of two or three pedants, one French, another German, and a third  English, and whether they like them or not, they must be content with  their society till they are seventeen, and whether they wish to or not,  must learn three barbarous languages, at the expense of our noble  Russian tongue, which they have sometimes completely forgotten by the  time the others are acquired. Again, if one of them wishes for some  career, he must become a soldier: if he is a sublieutenant, he is the  slave of the lieutenant; if he is a lieutenant, he is the slave of the  captain, and the captain of the major, and so on up to the emperor, who  is nobody's slave, but who one fine day is surprised at the table, while  walking, or in his bed, and is poisoned, stabbed, or strangled. If he  chooses a civil career, it is much the same. He marries a wife, and does  not love her; children come to him he knows not how, whom he has to  provide for; he must struggle incessantly to provide for his family if  he is poor, and if he is rich to prevent himself being robbed by his  steward and cheated by his tenants. Is this life? While we, gentlemen,  we are born, and that is the only pain we cost our mothers--all the rest  is the master's concern. He provides for us, he chooses our calling,  always easy enough to learn if we are not quite idiots. Are we ill? His  doctor attends us gratis; it is a loss to him if we die. Are we well? We  have our four certain meals a day, and a good stove to sleep near at  night. Do we fall in love? There is never any hindrance to our marriage,  if the woman loves us; the master himself asks us to hasten our  marriage, for he wishes us to have as many children as possible. And  when the children are born, he does for them in their turn all he has  done for us. Can you find me many great lords as happy as their slaves?\"    \"All this is true,\" said Gregory, pouring him out another glass of  brandy; \"but, after all, you are not free.\"    \"Free to do what?\" asked Ivan.    \"Free to go where you will and when you will.\"    \"I am as free as the air,\" replied Ivan.    \"Nonsense!\" said Gregory.    \"Free as air, I tell you; for I have good masters, and above all a good  mistress,\" continued Ivan, with a significant smile, \"and I have only to  ask and it is done.\"    \"What! if after having got drunk here to-day, you asked to come back  to-morrow to get drunk again?\" said Gregory, who in his challenge to  Ivan did not forget his own interests,--\"if you asked that?\"    \"I should come back again,\" said Ivan.    \"To-morrow?\" said Gregory.    \"To-morrow, the day after, every day if I liked....\"    \"The fact is, Ivan is our young lady's favourite,\" said another of the  count's slaves who was present, profiting by his comrade Ivan's  liberality.    \"It is all the same,\" said Gregory; \"for supposing such permission were  given you, money would soon run short.\"    \"Never!\" said Ivan, swallowing another glass of brandy, \"never will Ivan  want for money as long as there is a kopeck in my lady's purse.\"    \"I did not find her so liberal,\" said Gregory bitterly.    \"Oh, you forget, my friend; you know well she does not reckon with her  friends: remember the strokes of the knout.\"    \"I have no wish to speak about that,\" said Gregory. \"I know that she is  generous with blows, but her money is another thing. I have never seen  the colour of that.\"    \"Well, would you like to see the colour of mine?\" said Ivan, getting  more and more drunk. \"See here, here are kopecks, sorok-kopecks, blue  notes worth five roubles, red notes worth twenty five roubles, and  to-morrow, if you like, I will show you white notes worth fifty roubles.  A health to my lady Vaninka!\" And Ivan held out his glass again, and  Gregory filled it to the brim.    \"But does money,\" said Gregory, pressing Ivan more and more,--\"does  money make up for scorn?\"    \"Scorn!\" said Ivan,--\"scorn! Who scorns me? Do you, because you are  free? Fine freedom! I would rather be a well-fed slave than a free man  dying of hunger.\"    \"I mean the scorn of our masters,\" replied Gregory.    \"The scorn of our masters! Ask Alexis, ask Daniel there, if my lady  scorns me.\"    \"The fact is,\" said the two slaves in reply, who both belonged to the  general's household, \"Ivan must certainly have a charm; for everyone  talks to him as if to a master.\"    \"Because he is Annouschka's brother,\" said Gregory, \"and Annouschka is  my lady's foster-sister.\"    \"That may be so,\" said the two slaves.    \"For that reason or for some other,\" said Ivan; \"but, in short, that is  the case.\"    \"Yes; but if your sister should die?\" said Gregory. \"Ah!\"    \"If my sister should die, that would be a pity, for she is a good girl.  I drink to her health! But if she should die, that would make no  difference. I am respected for myself; they respect me because they fear  me.\"    \"Fear my lord Ivan!\" said Gregory, with a loud laugh. \"It follows, then,  that if my lord Ivan were tired of receiving orders, and gave them in  his turn, my lord Ivan would be obeyed.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Ivan.    \"He said 'perhaps,' repeated Gregory,\" laughing louder than ever,--\"he  said 'perhaps.' Did you hear him?\"    \"Yes,\" said the slaves, who had drunk so much that they could only  answer in monosyllables.    \"Well, I no longer say 'perhaps,' I now say 'for certain.'\"    \"Oh, I should like to see that,\" said Gregory; \"I would give something  to see that.\"    \"Well, send away these fellows, who are getting drunk like pigs, and for  nothing, you will find.\"    \"For nothing?\" said Gregory. \"You are jesting. Do you think I should  give them drink for nothing?\"    \"Well, we shall see. How much would be their score, for your atrocious  brandy, if they drank from now till midnight, when you are obliged to  shut up your tavern?\"    \"Not less than twenty roubles.\"    \"Here are thirty; turn there out, and let us remain by ourselves.\"    \"Friends,\" said Gregory, taking out his watch as if to look at the time,  \"it is just upon midnight; you know the governor's orders, so you must  go.\" The men, habituated like all Russians to passive obedience, went  without a murmur, and Gregory found himself alone with Ivan and the two  other slaves of the general.    \"Well, here we are alone,\" said Gregory. \"What do you mean to do?\"    \"Well, what would you say,\" replied Ivan, \"if in spite of the late hour  and the cold, and in spite of the fact that we are only slaves, my lady  were to leave her father's house and come to drink our healths?\"    \"I would say that you ought to take advantage of it,\" said Gregory,  shrugging his shoulders, \"and tell her to bring at the same time a  bottle of brandy. There is probably better brandy in the general's  cellar than in mine.\"    \"There is better,\" said Ivan, as if he was perfectly sure of it, \"and my  lady shall bring you a bottle of it.\"    \"You are mad!\" said Gregory.    \"He is mad!\" repeated the other two slaves mechanically.    \"Oh, I am mad?\" said Ivan. \"Well, will you take a wager?\"    \"What will you wager?\"    \"Two hundred roubles against a year of free drinking in your inn.\"    \"Done!\" said Gregory.    \"Are your comrades included?\" said the two moujiks.    \"They are included,\" said Ivan, \"and in consideration of them we will  reduce the time to six months. Is that agreed?\"    \"It is agreed,\" said Gregory.    The two who were making the wager shook hands, and the agreement was  perfected. Then, with an air of confidence, assumed to confound the  witnesses of this strange scene, Ivan wrapped himself in the fur coat  which, like a cautious man, he had spread on the stove, and went out.    At the end of half an hour he reappeared.    \"Well!\" cried Gregory and the two slaves together.    \"She is following,\" said Ivan.    The three tipplers looked at one another in amazement, but Ivan quietly  returned to his place in the middle of them, poured out a new bumper,  and raising his glass, cried--    \"To my lady's health! It is the least we can do when she is kind enough  to come and join us on so cold a night, when the snow is falling fast.\"    \"Annouschka,\" said a voice outside, \"knock at this door and ask Gregory  if he has not some of our servants with him.\"    Gregory and the two other slaves looked at one another, stupefied: they  had recognised Vaninka's voice. As for Ivan, he flung himself back in  his chair, balancing himself with marvellous impertinence.    Annouschka opened the door, and they could see, as Ivan had said, that  the snow was falling heavily.    \"Yes, madam,\" said the girl; \"my brother is there, with Daniel and  Alexis.\"    Vaninka entered.    \"My friends,\" said she, with a strange smile, \"I am told that you were  drinking my health, and I have come to bring you something to drink it  again. Here is a bottle of old French brandy which I have chosen for you  from my father's cellar. Hold out your glasses.\"    Gregory and the slaves obeyed with the slowness and hesitation of  astonishment, while Ivan held out his glass with the utmost effrontery.    Vaninka filled them to the brim herself, and then, as they hesitated to  drink, \"Come, drink to my health, friends,\" said she.    \"Hurrah!\" cried the drinkers, reassured by the kind and familiar tone of  their noble visitor, as they emptied their glasses at a draught.    Vaninka at once poured them out another glass; then putting the bottle  on the table, \"Empty the bottle, my friends,\" said she, \"and do not  trouble about me. Annouschka and I, with the permission 2668 of the  master of the house, will sit near the stove till the storm is over.\"    Gregory tried to rise and place stools near the stove, but whether he  was quite drunk or whether some narcotic had been mixed with the brandy,  he fell back on his seat, trying to stammer out"]]]
