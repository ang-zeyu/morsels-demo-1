This local irritation leads  the boy to attempt to allay the irritation through rubbing. Such  manipulation of the organ is very likely to excite it and to lead to  the discovery on the part of the boy that such local manipulation may  lead to pleasurable sensations of momentary duration. If he has not  been instructed by his parents that these organs are sacred to the  uses of manhood and that they will be injured if handled during  childhood, he is very likely to repeat this act until it becomes a  more or less fixed habit.    While it must be admitted that anything short of extreme excess in  this habit among little boys will not be permanently injurious if the  habit is stopped at puberty, it must be perfectly evident that if a  boy enters puberty with this habit, the psychical and physical  conditions of puberty are such as to make the habit very difficult to  stop. If it is not stopped a serious injury may result. So the  necessity hardly need be further urged for explaining to young boys  that these organs should not be handled.    After the boy enters puberty, the habit of masturbation either  acquired during puberty or carried into that stage from early boyhood,  begins to have a distinctly deleterious effect.    Let us now consider just what is the character of this deleterious  effect. From what we know of the physiology of the sexual apparatus,  it must be evident that a sexual orgasm could be produced during  waking hours only through strong stimulation of the activity of the  testes, accompanied by liberation of spermatozoa and of the other  elements of the vital fluid. Let us not forget in this connection, the  statement made above: that the testis produces two forms of secretion,  the internal secretion and the external secretion, the internal  secretion being absorbed, produces those male characteristics which we  group together under virility, while the external secretion is used  for procreation. Spermatozoa do not make any part of the internal  secretion. One reason for this must be evident, i.e., that being  cellular elements, they could not pass through the vessel walls and be  absorbed into the blood current, and if they could, by some special  adaptation, get into the blood current, there is no conceivable action  which they could perform in the body. We must then look upon the  internal secretion as composed of the liquid elements of the  testicular secretion.    So far as physiologists know at present, the external secretion  differs from the internal secretion only in possessing spermatozoa.  When we say that the testes form their external secretion under sexual  excitement only, we simply mean that they liberate or release  spermatozoa under sexual excitement. The spermatozoa must be looked  upon as the fertilizing element of the semen, while the liquid portion  of the semen probably contains that mysterious element which, absorbed  into the body, produces virility and which, passed out with the  spermatozoa, may have an important role to perform in the fertilizing  function.    If the adolescent young man is leading a continent life, we may assume  that from time to time he is subjected to conditions which serve as  strong sexual stimuli, arousing in him a definite desire for sexual  intercourse; but leading a continent life, he curbs his desire and  fixes his thoughts upon other subjects. In this way, though the sexual  excitement is brought quickly under abeyance, we can rest assured that  a certain number of spermatozoa have been released from the testes;  and that the other secretions have been increased in volume. The  excitement may be sufficient even to cause an erection, and produce a  few drops of the secretion of Cowper's glands. The spermatozoa,  together with a small amount of the liquid secretion, will make their  way gradually along the vasa deferentia and collect in the ampullae.  The bulk of the liquid secretion, however, will, in the course of the  following hours or days, be reabsorbed, thus making for virility. The  small advance guard of spermatozoa that may have made their way to the  ampullae will undergo a gradual decrease of their nascent activity, as  the days go by. On the occasion of the next nocturnal emission the  ampullae will empty along with the seminal vesicles and these  spermatozoa pass out. If they be examined under the microscope as a  part of a normal nocturnal emission, they will be found to be almost  motionless or very greatly lacking in typical spermatozoon activity.    Now let us suppose that the young man, instead of curbing his sexual  appetite, resorts, after a season of erotic imaginations, to the act  of masturbation. We may picture the seminal ducts, vasa deferentia and  ampullae as being gorged with the secretion of the testes, including,  of course, myriads of just released and nascent spermatozoa, together  with several cubic centimeters of the liquid portion of the testicular  secretion. The act of masturbation causes an orgasm and leads to a  complete emptying of all these ducts. Thus we note that in this case  the virile fluid is wasted, not being used in the procreative act or  reabsorbed to exert its influence on virility. Nature's ends have been  defeated. The system suffers a certain degree of depletion from which  it recovers only after hours or even days. It must be evident from  this picture of the processes that go on in the male sexual apparatus  incident to the act of masturbation that the act cannot be performed  repeatedly, as it naturally is when it becomes a habit, without  interfering with the virility of the adolescent male.    In the study of a large number of cases the author has found that the  principal _physical_ changes that occur in a young man as the result  of this habit are, flabbiness of muscle and clamminess of hands. The  really virile man possesses firm muscles and clear, direct eyes and a  strong grip; usually also a warm grip.    It has been thought by some that pimples on the face are a sign of  masturbation in the youth, but such is not the case. They are a sign  of lack of elimination through the kidneys and bowels and are not to  be interpreted as having any essential relation to masturbation. There  may possibly be an incidental relation growing out of the fact that in  some cases of masturbation that habit seems to affect the nutrition  and that in turn may cause the appearance of pimples on the face of  the adolescent. However, one must be very slow to pass judgment in  these cases.    Not the least important among the results of masturbation is the  attitude of the victim to society in general. This _psychical_ change  is noticed in immoderate cases of masturbation and takes the form of  disinclination to enter into any physical contests, or games; and  disinclination to cultivate the society of the opposite sex. Here  again one must be conservative in his judgment, because there are  individuals who possess a very retiring temperament naturally, and who  may become so engrossed in study or productive work that they take  little share in the society of either sex, so that individuals who may  be wholly innocent of any abuse of their sexual apparatus would suffer  a very grave injustice if they were classed among the masturbators. So  allow the author at this place to emphasize the importance of never  passing judgment on anybody in these matters on circumstantial  evidence.    While the damage that one may do to his system through the practice of  masturbation may not be very serious, in many cases that have come  under the author's observation in which the habit has reached extreme  limits, very serious, sometimes irretrievable damage has been done,  yet the encouraging feature of this whole matter is, that if the  adolescent youth, who is practicing this habit, is warned of its  danger and stops at once absolutely, nature comes to his rescue, and  gradually, step by step, but surely, rebuilds the whole fabric of his  virility, bringing back gradually the flush of perfect health into his  cheek, the light of perfect manhood into his eye and the tone of  perfect virility into his muscles.    This change can be wrought in from one to three years of absolute  continence. Nature, like a loving mother, heals the wounds of her  child with a kiss.      3. CONTINENCE.    Such frequent reference has been made above to continence in  antithesis to illicit intercourse and masturbation that little need be  said in addition to that which has preceded. The young man who holds  before his mental vision an ideal of the home he hopes some day to  establish--in which a pure wife reigns as queen, sovereign of his  life, and gently hovers over a brood of lusty boys and fair  girls--cannot for a moment consider as a sane solution of his sexual  problem, periodic visits to the house of ill fame or the periodic  lapse into illicit intercourse with clandestines; nor can he expect to  develop his powers, physically or intellectually to the highest  possible degree if he permits himself to contract that habit  [masturbation] which, step by step, undermines his development. There  is open to the young man only one of the three alternatives mentioned  above, i.e., TO LEAD THE \"CONTINENT LIFE.\"    The continent life is a goal which every healthy young man should  strive to reach. To arrive at a goal that is before us and above us  requires sacrifice and brings compensation. The sacrifice takes the  form of the exertion of the whole will power of the man and the  painstaking observance of those rules of hygiene which make continent  living more easily attainable. The compensations of continence are  those that come from the assurance that the young man has of his  virility, of his worthiness to take the hand of a pure wife in  wedlock, of the consciousness of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],[0,"Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#11)"],[1,"the colour of the field and  all its flowers,\" said the sea serpent, \"and your dress the colour of  the sea and all its fishes, and your dress the colour of the sky and  all its stars. Then hurry back here to the sea for I have been  preparing a surprise for you.\"    All the time the king had been procuring the wonderful gowns for  Dionysia the sea serpent had been building a ship for her. When  Dionysia returned from the royal palace with her lovely dresses all  carefully packed in a box there was a queer little boat awaiting her.  It was not at all like any other boat she had ever seen and she was  almost afraid to get into it when Labismena asked her to try it. \"This  little ship which I have built for you,\" said Labismena, \"will carry  you far away over the sea to the kingdom of a prince who is the most  charming prince in all the world. When you see him you will want to  marry him above all others.\"    \"O, Labismena! How can I ever thank you for all you have done for  me?\" cried Dionysia.    \"You can do the greatest thing in the world for me,\" said Labismena;  \"though I have never told you and I do not believe that you have ever  suspected it, I am really an enchanted princess. I shall have to  remain in the form of a sea serpent until the happiest maiden in all  the world, at the hour of her greatest happiness, calls my name three  times. You will be the very happiest girl in all the world on the day  of your marriage, and if you will remember to call my name three times  then you will break my enchantment and I shall once more be a lovely  princess instead of a sea serpent.\"    Dionysia promised her friend that she would remember to do this. The  sea serpent asked her to promise three times to make sure. When  Dionysia had promised three times and again embraced her old playmate  and thanked her for all that she had done she sailed away in the  little ship. The sea serpent disappeared into the sea.    Dionysia sailed and sailed in the little ship and at last it bore her  to a lovely island. She thought that she had reached her destination,  so she stepped out of the boat not forgetting to take her box of  dresses with her. As soon as she was out of the boat it sailed away.  \"Now what shall I ever do?\" said Dionysia. \"The ship has gone away and  left me and how shall I ever earn my living? I have never done  anything useful in all my life.\"    Dionysia surely had to do something to earn her living immediately, so  she at once set out to see what she could find to do. She went from  house to house asking for food and work. At last she came to the royal  palace. Here at the royal palace they told her that they had great  need of a maid to take care of the hens. Dionysia thought that this  was something which she could do, so she accepted the position at  once. It was, of course, very different work from being a princess in  a royal palace but it provided her with food and shelter, and when  Dionysia thought of having to marry the old king she was never sorry  that she had left home.    Time passed and at last there was a great feast day celebrated in the  city. Everybody in the palace went except the little maid who minded  the hens. After everybody had gone away Dionysia decided that she  would go to the _festa_ too. She combed her hair and put on her gown  which was the colour of the fields and all their flowers. In this  wonderful gown she was sure nobody would ever guess that she was the  little maid who had been left at home to mind the hens. She did want  to go to the _festa_! She hurried there as fast as she could and  arrived just in time for the dances.    Everybody at the _festa_ noticed the beautiful maiden in her gown the  colour of the fields and all their flowers. The prince fell madly in  love with her. Nobody had ever seen her before and nobody could find  out who the beautiful stranger was or where she came from. Before the  _festa_ was over Dionysia slipped away, and, when the rest of the  royal household returned home there was the little maid minding the  hens just as they had left her.    The second day of the _festa_ everybody went early except the little  maid who looked after the hens. When the others had gone she put on  her dress the colour of the sea and all its fishes and went to the  _festa_. She attracted even more attention than she had the day  before.    When the _festa_ was over and the royal household had returned to the  royal palace, the prince remarked to his mother, \"Don't you think that  the beautiful stranger at the _festa_ looks like the little maid who  minds our hens?\"    \"What nonsense,\" replied his mother. \"How could the little maid who  minds our hens ever get such wonderful gowns to wear?\" Just to make  sure, however, the prince told the royal councillor to find out if  the little maid who minds the royal hens had been to the _festa_. All  the servants told about leaving her at home with the hens and coming  back and finding her just as they had left her.    \"Whoever the beautiful stranger at the _festa_ may be,\" said the  prince, \"she is the one above all others whom I want for my wife. I  shall find her some way.\"    The third day of the _festa_ Dionysia went attired in her gown the  colour of the sky and all its stars. The prince fell more madly in  love with her than ever. He could not get her to tell him who she was  or where she lived but he gave her a beautiful jewel.    When the prince returned home he would not eat any food. He grew thin  and pale. Every one around the palace tried his best to invent some  dish which would tempt the prince's appetite.    Finally the little maid who took care of the hens said that she  thought she could prepare a dish which the prince would eat.    Accordingly she made a dish of broth for the prince and in the bottom  of the dish she dropped the jewel which the prince had given her.    When the broth was set before the prince he was about to send it away  untouched, just as he did everything else, but the sparkling jewel  attracted his attention.    \"Who made this dish of broth?\" he asked as soon as he could speak.    \"It was made by the little maid who minds the hens,\" replied his  mother.    \"Send for the little maid to come to me at once,\" cried the prince. \"I  knew that the beautiful stranger at the _festa_ looked like our little  maid who minds the hens.\"    The prince married Dionysia the very next day and Dionysia was the  very happiest girl in all the world, for from the first moment that  she had seen the prince, she had known that he was the one above all  others whom she wished to marry.    Alas! In Dionysia's excitement she forgot all about calling the name  of her old playmate, Labismena, at the hour of her marriage as she had  promised to do. She thought of nothing but the prince.    There was no escape for Labismena. She had to remain in the form of a  sea serpent because of Dionysia's neglect. She had lost her chance to  come out of the sea and become a lovely princess herself and find a  charming prince of her own. For this reason her sad moan is heard in  the sea until this very day. Perhaps you have noticed it.    You will often hear the call come from the sea as it breaks against  the shore, \"Dionysia, Di-o-ny-si-a.\" No wonder that the sea moans. It  is enough to make a sea serpent sad to be forgotten by the very person  one has done most to help.          XVIII    How the Brazilian Beetles Got    Their Gorgeous Coats      In Brazil the beetles have such beautifully coloured, hard-shelled  coats upon their backs that they are often set in pins and necklaces  like precious stones. Once upon a time, years and years ago, they had  ordinary plain brown coats. This is how it happened that the Brazilian  beetle earned a new coat.    One day a little brown beetle was crawling along a wall when a big  grey rat ran out of a hole in the wall and looked down scornfully at  the little beetle. \"O ho!\" he said to the beetle, \"how slowly you  crawl along. You'll never get anywhere in the world. Just look at me  and see how fast I can run.\"    The big grey rat ran to the end of the wall, wheeled around, and came  back to the place where the little beetle was slowly crawling along at  only a tiny distance from where the rat had left her.    \"Don't you wish that you could run like that?\" said the big grey rat  to the little brown beetle.    \"You are surely a fast runner,\" replied the little brown beetle  politely. Her mother had taught her always to be polite and had often  said to her that a really polite beetle never boasts about her own  accomplishments. The little brown beetle never boasted a single boast  about the things she could do. She just went on slowly crawling along  the wall.    A bright green and gold parrot in the mango tree over the wall had  heard the conversation. \"How would you like to race with the beetle?\"  he asked the big grey rat. \"I live next door to the tailor bird,\" he  added, \"and just to make the race exciting I'll offer a bright  coloured coat as a prize to the one who wins the race. You may choose  for it any colour you like and I'll have it made to order.\"    \"I'd like a yellow coat with stripes like the tiger's,\" said the big  grey rat, looking over his shoulder at his gaunt grey sides as if he  were already admiring his new coat.    \"I'd like a beautiful, bright coloured new coat, too,\" said the little  brown beetle.    The big grey rat laughed long and loud until his gaunt grey sides were  shaking. \"Why, you talk just as if you thought you had a chance to win  the race,\" he said, when he could speak.    The bright green and gold parrot set the royal palm tree at the top of  the cliff as the goal of the race. He gave the signal to start and  then he flew away to the royal palm tree to watch for the end of the  race.    The big grey rat ran as fast as he could. Then he thought how very  tired he was getting. \"What's the use of hurrying?\" he said to  himself. \"The little brown"]]]
