Those in whose eyes this reticence on the part of heretics is no evil,  should consider in the first place, that in consequence of it there is  never any fair and thorough discussion of heretical opinions; and that  such of them as could not stand such a discussion, though they may be  prevented from spreading, do not disappear. But it is not the minds of  heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban placed on all inquiry  which does not end in the orthodox conclusions. The greatest harm done  is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development is  cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy. Who can compute  what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined  with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous,  independent train of thought, lest it should land them in something  which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? Among  them we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, and  subtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticating  with an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources of  ingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscience  and reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the end  succeed in doing. No one can be a great thinker who does not recognise,  that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to  whatever conclusions it may lead. Truth gains more even by the errors of  one who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the  true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer  themselves to think. Not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great  thinkers, that freedom of thinking is required. On the contrary, it is  as much, and even more indispensable, to enable average human beings to  attain the mental stature which they are capable of. There have been,  and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere of  mental slavery. But there never has been, nor ever will be, in that  atmosphere, an intellectually active people. Where any people has made a  temporary approach to such a character, it has been because the dread  of heterodox speculation was for a time suspended. Where there is a  tacit convention that principles are not to be disputed; where the  discussion of the greatest questions which can occupy humanity is  considered to be closed, we cannot hope to find that generally high  scale of mental activity which has made some periods of history so  remarkable. Never when controversy avoided the subjects which are large  and important enough to kindle enthusiasm, was the mind of a people  stirred up from its foundations, and the impulse given which raised even  persons of the most ordinary intellect to something of the dignity of  thinking beings. Of such we have had an example in the condition of  Europe during the times immediately following the Reformation; another,  though limited to the Continent and to a more cultivated class, in the  speculative movement of the latter half of the eighteenth century; and a  third, of still briefer duration, in the intellectual fermentation of  Germany during the Goethian and Fichtean period. These periods differed  widely in the particular opinions which they developed; but were alike  in this, that during all three the yoke of authority was broken. In  each, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one had  yet taken its place. The impulse given at these three periods has made  Europe what it now is. Every single improvement which has taken place  either in the human mind or in institutions, may be traced distinctly to  one or other of them. Appearances have for some time indicated that all  three impulses are well-nigh spent; and we can expect no fresh start,  until we again assert our mental freedom.    Let us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dismissing  the supposition that any of the received opinions may be false, let us  assume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the manner in  which they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely and  openly canvassed. However unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion  may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be  moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not  fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead  dogma, not a living truth.    There is a class of persons (happily not quite so numerous as formerly)  who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they think  true, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion,  and could not make a tenable defence of it against the most superficial  objections. Such persons, if they can once get their creed taught from  authority, naturally think that no good, and some harm, comes of its  being allowed to be questioned. Where their influence prevails, they  make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wisely  and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and  ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and  when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give  way before the slightest semblance of an argument. Waiving, however,  this possibility--assuming that the true opinion abides in the mind, but  abides as a prejudice, a belief independent of, and proof against,  argument--this is not the way in which truth ought to be held by a  rational being. This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus held, is but  one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which  enunciate a truth.    If the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be cultivated, a thing  which Protestants at least do not deny, on what can these faculties be  more appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things which  concern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to hold  opinions on them? If the cultivation of the understanding consists in  one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of  one's own opinions. Whatever people believe, on subjects on which it is  of the first importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to  defend against at least the common objections. But, some one may say,  \"Let them be _taught_ the grounds of their opinions. It does not follow  that opinions must be merely parroted because they are never heard  controverted. Persons who learn geometry do not simply commit the  theorems to memory, but understand and learn likewise the  demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that they remain ignorant  of the grounds of geometrical truths, because they never hear any one  deny, and attempt to disprove them.\" Undoubtedly: and such teaching  suffices on a subject like mathematics, where there is nothing at all to  be said on the wrong side of the question. The peculiarity of the  evidence of mathematical truths is, that all the argument is on one  side. There are no objections, and no answers to objections. But on  every subject on which difference of opinion is possible, the truth  depends on a balance to be struck between two sets of conflicting  reasons. Even in natural philosophy, there is always some other  explanation possible of the same facts; some geocentric theory instead  of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to be  shown why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until this is  shown, and until we know how it is shown, we do not understand the  grounds of our opinion. But when we turn to subjects infinitely more  complicated, to morals, religion, politics, social relations, and the  business of life, three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed  opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opinion  different from it. The greatest orator, save one, of antiquity, has left  it on record that he always studied his adversary's case with as great,  if not with still greater, intensity than even his own. What Cicero  practised as the means of forensic success, requires to be imitated by  all who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth. He who knows  only his own side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be  good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally  unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so  much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either  opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension of judgment,  and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by  authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to  which he feels most inclination. Nor is it enough that he should hear  the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they  state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That is  not the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into real  contact with his own mind. He must be able to hear them from persons who  actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and do their very  utmost for them. He must know them in their most plausible and  persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which  the true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; else he  will never really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets  and removes that difficulty. Ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called  educated men are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluently  for their opinions. Their conclusion may be true, but it might be false  for anything they know: they have never thrown"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#11)"],[1,"l. 1775-85.            _Pattern, see p. 335._]    [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Boot shapes.

James II and William and Mary.]    Shoes became very square at the toes, or blocked as in Fig. 70, No. 6.  The fronts were set with large rosettes of silk and silver or gold  lace, the heels varied much in height, that mostly favoured being a  large, low heel. A quaint fashion of shoe combined with a clog sole was  an interesting shape (see illustration of clogs, p. 106). Fairly tight  top-boots, coming well above the knee, were often turned down. Other  boots with large bell-tops, turned over or pushed down, were covered or  filled with a lace or bell-shaped stocking-top. A sash was worn round  the waist or across the body over the left shoulder (the length and  width of these is given in the description of patterns, p. 279). A broad  belt, or sword-hanger, came across the right shoulder. Gloves were  beautifully embroidered in gold, pearls, or coloured silks, the  gauntlets being from five to eight inches deep.      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. THE COMMONWEALTH. MALE AND FEMALE.    The same shapes apply to costume during the Commonwealth, though a  sterner effect was given by the choice of plain decoration and less  colour. A small or a large plain collar, and the disappearance of  slashings on the coat, and a longer skirt became noticeable. A very  high tapered hat, with stiff circular brim, was worn by the Puritans,  and little, close, black hoods were much favoured. A general reaction  from gay extravagance set in.      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. CHARLES II.    FEMALE.    The hair was set out from the head on combs with falling ringlets, and  several small flat ringlets were placed on the forehead. The back of the  hair was plaited into a knot, and pearl strings were interlaced, or  ribbon loops caught in at either side. Toward 1680 the hair was worn  tightly curled and fulled out into a round shape with a curl or two  falling on the front of the shoulders; small feathers or long feathers  were also worn. Hats were of a similar shape to those of the last reign,  with a stiffer and narrower curved brim; but the chief head-dress was a  large hood faced with another material, which latter was tied under the  chin; these mostly formed part of a cape also.

(_c_) Silk-embroidered Suit. 1765-80.]    [Illustration: FIG. 73.        1, 2, 3, 4.--Back and Front of two Corset Bodices. Period Charles II.      5, 6.--Two Corsets. Period Charles II.      7, 8.--Two Bodice types. Period Charles I.]    The bodice again became much longer and of a pointed shape, but many  corset bodices took a round point, and a round neck coming well off  the shoulders became general, usually decorated with a plain wide band  of lace. Ruffs and collars were no longer seen amongst the upper  classes. Very full sleeves and large opened sleeves were tied or clasped  over full lawn ones, and at times separated from the shoulders, being  caught effectively with jewels. Groups of ribbons were placed at the  breast or point of the bodice, and the ends of sleeves or shoulders,  besides at the fronts of the outer skirt when divided, also in the  gathering of the lawn sleeves. Stomachers were not much worn, but a  drape of soft silk was caught here and there round the neck of bodice,  and large draperies were clasped to the shoulders. Loose robes and robes  shaped to the figure, opening down the front from the neck even to the  waist, with a clasp or several holding them together; these were worn  over a quilted linen corset laced in front as in the illustration, but  the bodice was often formed on a corset. Long gloves and mittens were in  use, and small muffs with ribbon loops on the front were carried.  High-heeled shoes with very long square toes were affected in imitation  of the male shoe, but most ladies now began to wear a very pointed  shoe.    [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Sleeve treatments. Period Charles II.]      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. CHARLES II.    MALE.    Long hair or wigs of long curls falling on the shoulders, a very narrow  moustache and point of beard on the chin came with this reign. Lace  collars of a smaller square or rounded shape were in use, but a fall of  lace pleated in the centre soon took its place. High-crowned hats with a  band and bow in front and a flat, waved, or curved brim, with feathers  on either side or all round, were the fashion, the crowns becoming  shorter during the reign; the fronts and sometimes the sides of the brim  are seen turned up, and so begins to form the three-cornered hat, which  remained so long a feature in history.    [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Period Charles II.]    We find with extravagant shapes a happy return of gay colours. The  high-waisted jerkins of the Charles I period were now seen without the  skirt (as very short jackets), leaving the lawn shirt to show between  this and the breeches, besides which the jackets were nearly always left  unbuttoned several inches up, some being cut away in a rounded shape and  also having short sleeves. The lower arm was covered with a full lawn  sleeve caught at two or even three distances with a loop of ribbons or  bows, and finishing with a wide lace frill; a bunch of ribbon loops was  also often seen on the right shoulder. A long circular cloak, with  turned-back fronts forming a collar in many, still retained the hanging  sleeve, and was mostly decorated with bands of heavy braid. A long  square coat also came in about 1666, buttoned right down the front, with  pockets set very low in the skirt, and large narrow cuffs opened at the  back as in Plate VIII (see p. 90).    Very full breeches were worn to just about the knee or shorter, with a  fringe of ribbon loops, and a row or several rows of the same were  arranged at the waist. A short petticoat just showed the under breeches,  many of which were turned into a doublet shape by an additional piece  looped up loosely from the knee with a silk filling; the ribbon loops at  the waist were repeated up the sides of the petticoat. Silk garters were  worn with bows on both sides of the leg, or a deep lace fall came from  the end of the breeches to the middle of the calf; a lace setting also  filled the wide top of the boots, which was worn very low, even to the  ankles. These short bell-topped boots were favoured, with high heels  and very square toes. Shoes were long and square (or duck-billed) at the  toes; and had a high narrow front to the instep, and latchets fastened  with a stiffened butterfly bow, besides, at times, a rosette lower down  on the front: red heels were in evidence. The sword-band was very wide,  and many were decorated with gold embroidery.    [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Costume types. Period Charles II.]      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. JAMES II.    FEMALE.    The hair was still worn full at the sides over a comb, as in the former  reign, with curls dropping to the shoulders, but they now began to  discard the set-out comb and the little flat curls on the forehead, the  hair being of a round shape or parted from the centre and mounted higher  and narrower on the head, in the latter part of this reign. The same  large hoods and drapes continued in use, and a high goffered head-dress  with set-out front began to appear; the same shaped bodice with round  low neck showing the shoulders, often set with a stomacher front or  jewelled in that form, and smaller decorations of ribbon loops were  still favoured. A smaller and shorter sleeve began to appear with a  turned-up cuff, and the gathered-in lawn sleeves and ruffles caught here  and there with pearls or clasps as before, besides the same light  drapery clasped about the breast front. The overskirt was now looped  back, the points being held together, giving a wide display of the  underskirt, which was heavily banded or had a jewel setting down the  front. Other train skirts, also divided in front, were bordered with  drawn silk caught at intervals into long puffs. Very small muffs were  the fashion. Shoes increased their pointed shape and rather large heels  are to be noted, but some shoes assumed a very narrow square toe; they  were either tied from small latchets with a bow, or with buckled  latchets. Longer gloves were worn, and large full cloaks with hoods or  large drapery wraps when required for outdoor wear.    [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Costume notes. Period 1670-1690.]      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. JAMES II.    MALE.    The same long wig was worn as in the last reign, but the curls were more  of a set ringlet type, and embroidered caps were worn when these were  taken off. The face was now clean shaven until the 19th century. Hats  also of the older character were retained, but the turned-up  three-cornered shape, filled with short feathers, became more settled in  fashion, and they were heavily banded with gold braid or lace on the  edge.    [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Period 1690-1700.]    A smart bow was worn crosswise over the folded lace fall at the neck.  The coat was a very long square shape to the knees, the stiff skirt  often set out over rather full breeches, which were sometimes \"shorts,\"  and just above the knee, the stocking being often brought up above the  knee, with a garter just below. The sleeves were short, above or below  the elbow, with a turned-up cuff, leaving the full-gathered lawn sleeve  with a lace ruffle to show at the wrist. A sash encircled the waist, and  often shut in the sword-belt, which hung from the right shoulder. The  coat had buttons from the neck to the bottom of the skirt, though the  lower buttons were seldom fastened; the sides of the skirt were opened  up about 11 inches, and also the back seam to the same height; most  seams were heavily"]]]
