The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be  imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for  infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources  (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can  be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and terminals    This entry lists major ports and terminals primarily on the basis of  the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through the facilities on an annual  basis. In some instances, the number of containers handled or ship  visits were also considered.    Public debt    This entry records the cumulatiive total of all government borrowings  less repayments that are denominated in a country's home currency.  Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which reflects  the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and public sector  and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.    Radio broadcast stations    This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast  stations.    Railways    This entry states the total route length of the railway network and of  its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow, and dual. Other  gauges are listed under note.    Reference maps    This section includes world and regional maps.    Refugees and internally displaced persons    This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees or  internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee  according to a United Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside  his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-  founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,  nationality, membership in a particular social group or political  opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the  protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of  persecution.\" The UN established the Office of the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters worldwide. The  UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  (UNRWA) has a different, operational definition for a Palestinian  refugee: \"a person whose normal place of residence was Palestine during  the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means  of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\" However, UNHCR also  assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA  definition. The term \"internally displaced person\" is not specifically  covered in the UN Convention; it is used to describe people who have  fled their homes for reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within  their own national territory and are subject to the laws of that state.    Religions    This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population.    Reserves of foreign exchange and gold    This entry gives the dollar value for the stock of all financial assets  that are available to the central monetary authority for use in meeting  a country's balance of payments needs as of the end-date of the period  specified. This category includes not only foreign currency and gold,  but also a country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the  International Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.    Roadways    This entry gives the total length of the road network and includes the  length of the paved and unpaved portions.    Sex ratio    This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age  groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and  for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an  indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For  instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now  attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong  preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and  fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest among young adult  males who are unable to find partners.    Suffrage    This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to  vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers    All telephone numbers in The World Factbook consist of the country code  in brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and  the local number. The one component that is not presented is the  international access code, which varies from country to country. For  example, an international direct dial telephone call placed from the US  to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows: 011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where 011  is the international access code for station-to-station calls; 01 is  for calls other than station-to-station calls, [34] is the country code  for Spain, (1) is the city code for Madrid, 577 is the local exchange,  and xxxx is the local telephone number. An international direct dial  telephone call placed from another country to the US would be as  follows: international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where [ 1] is  the country code for the US, (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,  939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number.

The  appointed time arrived, they embraced each other as if parting for ever,  and then the men, unarmed, in number six hundred and seventy, started  for Chenderia. At the gate of the town they encountered a troop of  Albanians, who followed as if to escort them, and which increased in  number as they proceeded. Soon they arrived in the dread presence of Ali  Pacha. Grouped in formidable masses around him stood several thousand of  his fierce soldiery.    The unhappy Kardikiotes realised their utter helplessness, and saw that  they, their wives an children, were completely at the mercy of their  implacable enemy. They fell prostrate before the pacha, and with all the  fervour which the utmost terror could inspire, implored him to grant  them a generous pardon.    Ali for some time silently enjoyed the pleasure of seeing his ancient  enemies lying before him prostrate in the dust. He then desired them to  rise, reassured them, called them brothers, sons, friends of his heart.  Distinguishing some of his old acquaintances, he called them to him,  spoke familiarly of the days of their youth, of their games, their early  friendships, and pointing to the young men, said, with tears in his  eyes.    \"The discord which has divided us for so many years has allowed children  not born at the time of our dissension to grow into men. I have lost the  pleasure of watching the development of the off-spring of my neighbours  and the early friends of my youth, and of bestowing benefits on them,  but I hope shortly to repair the natural results of our melancholy  divisions.\"    He then made them splendid promises, and ordered them to assemble in a  neighbouring caravanserai, where he wished to give them a banquet in  proof of reconciliation. Passing from the depths of despair to  transports of joy, the Kardikiotes repaired gaily to the caravanserai,  heaping blessings on the pacha, and blaming each other for having ever  doubted his good faith.    Ali was carried down from Chenderia in a litter, attended by his  courtiers, who celebrated his clemency in pompous speeches, to which he  replied with gracious smiles. At the foot of the steep descent he  mounted his horse, and, followed by his troops, rode towards the  caravanserai. Alone, and in silence, he rode twice round it, then,  returning to the gate, which had just been closed by his order, he  pulled up his horse, and, signing to his own bodyguard to attack the  building, \"Slay them!\" he cried in a voice of thunder.    The guards remained motionless in surprise and horror, then as the  pacha, with a roar, repeated his order, they indignantly flung down  their arms. In vain he harangued, flattered, or threatened them; some  preserved a sullen silence, others ventured to demand mercy. Then he  ordered them away, and, calling on the Christian Mirdites who served  under his banner.    \"To you, brave Latins,\" he cried, \"I will now entrust the duty of  exterminating the foes of my race. Avenge me, and I will reward you  magnificently.\"    A confused murmur rose from the ranks. Ali imagined they were consulting  as to what recompense should be required as the price of such deed.    \"Speak,\" said he; \"I am ready to listen to your demands and to satisfy  them.\"    Then the Mirdite leader came forward and threw back the hood of his  black cloak.    \"O Pacha!\" said he, looking Ali boldly in the face, \"thy words are an  insult; the Mirdites do not slaughter unarmed prisoners in cold blood.  Release the Kardikiotes, give them arms, and we will fight them to the  death; but we serve thee as soldiers and not as executioners.\"    At these words; which the black-cloaked battalion received with  applause, Ali thought himself betrayed, and looked around with doubt and  mistrust. Fear was nearly taking the place of mercy, words of pardon  were on his lips, when a certain Athanasius Vaya, a Greek schismatic,  and a favourite of the pacha's, whose illegitimate son he was supposed  to be, advanced at the head of the scum of the army, and offered to  carry out the death sentence. Ali applauded his zeal, gave him full  authority to act, and spurred his horse to the top of a neighbouring  hill, the better to enjoy the spectacle. The Christian Mirdites and the  Mohammedan guards knelt together to pray for the miserable Kardikiotes,  whose last hour had come.    The caravanserai where they were shut in was square enclosure, open to  the sky, and intended to shelter herds of buffaloes. The prisoners  having heard nothing of what passed outside, were astonished to behold  Athanasius Vaya and his troop appearing on the top of the wall. They did  not long remain in doubt. Ali gave the signal by a pistol-shot, and a  general fusillade followed. Terrible cries echoed from the court; the  prisoners, terrified, wounded, crowded one upon another for shelter.  Some ran frantically hither and thither in this enclosure with no  shelter and no exit, until they fell, struck down by bullets. Some tried  to climb the walls, in hope of either escape or vengeance, only to be  flung back by either scimitars or muskets. It was a terrible scene of  despair and death.    After an hour of firing, a gloomy silence descended on the place, now  occupied solely by a heap of corpses. Ali forbade any burial rites on  pain of death, and placed over the gate an inscription in letters of  gold, informing posterity that six hundred Kardikiotes had there been  sacrificed to the memory of his mother Kamco.    When the shrieks of death ceased in the enclosure, they began to be  heard in the town. The assassins spread themselves through it, and  having violated the women and children, gathered them into a crowd to be  driven to Libokovo. At every halt in this frightful journey fresh  marauders fell on the wretched victims, claiming their share in cruelty  and debauchery. At length they arrived at their destination, where the  triumphant and implacable Chainitza awaited them. As after the taking of  Kormovo, she compelled the women to cut off their hair and to stuff with  it a mattress on which she lay. She then stripped them, and joyfully  narrated to them the massacre of their husbands, fathers, brothers and  sons, and when she had sufficiently enjoyed their misery they were again  handed over to the insults of the soldiery. Chainitza finally published  an edict forbidding either clothes, shelter, or food to be given to the  women and children of Kardiki, who were then driven forth into the woods  either to die of hunger or to be devoured by wild beasts. As to the  seventy-two hostages, Ali put them all to death when he returned to  Janina. His vengeance was indeed complete.    But as, filled with a horrible satisfaction, the pacha was enjoying the  repose of a satiated tiger, an indignant and threatening voice reached  him even in the recesses of his palace. The Sheik Yussuf, governor of  the castle of Janina, venerated as a saint by the Mohammedans on account  of his piety, and universally beloved and respected for his many  virtues, entered Ali's sumptuous dwelling for the first time. The guards  on beholding him remained stupefied and motionless, then the most devout  prostrated themselves, while others went to inform the pacha; but no one  dared hinder the venerable man, who walked calmly and solemnly through  the astonished attendants. For him there existed no antechamber, no  delay; disdaining the ordinary forms of etiquette, he paced slowly  through the various apartments, until, with no usher to announce him, he  reached that of Ali. The latter, whose impiety by no means saved him  from superstitious terrors, rose hastily from the divan and advanced to  meet the holy sheik, who was followed by a crowd of silent courtiers.  Ali addressed him with the utmost respect, and endeavoured even to kiss  his right hand. Yussuf hastily withdrew it, covered it with his mantle,  and signed to the pacha to seat himself. Ali mechanically obeyed, and  waited in solemn silence to hear the reason of this unexpected visit.    Yussuf desired him to listen with all attention, and then reproached him  for his injustice and rapine, his treachery and cruelty, with such vivid  eloquence that his hearers dissolved in tears. Ali, though much  dejected, alone preserved his equanimity, until at length the sheik  accused him of having caused the death of Emineh. He then grew pale, and  rising, cried with terror:    \"Alas! my father, whose name do you now pronounce? Pray for me, or at  least do not sink me to Gehenna with your curses!\"    \"There is no need to curse thee,\" answered Yussuf. \"Thine own crimes  bear witness against thee. Allah has heard their cry. He will summon  thee, judge thee, and punish thee eternally. Tremble, for the time is at  hand! Thine hour is coming--is coming--is coming!\"    Casting a terrible glance at the pacha, the holy man turned his back on  him, and stalked out of the apartment without another word.    Ali, in terror, demanded a thousand pieces of gold, put them in a white  satin purse, and himself hastened with them to overtake the sheik,  imploring him to recall his threats. But Yussuf deigned no answer, and  arrived at the threshold of the palace, shook off the dust of his feet  against it.    Ali returned to his apartment sad and downcast, and many days elapsed  before he could shake off the depression caused by this scene. But soon  he felt more ashamed of his inaction than of the reproaches which had  caused it, and on the first opportunity resumed his usual mode of life.    The occasion was the marriage of Moustai, Pacha of Scodra, with the  eldest daughter of Veli Pacha, called the Princess of Aulis, because she  had for dowry whole villages in that district. Immediately after the  announcement of this marriage Ali set on foot a sort of saturnalia,"]]]
