The glowing creatures surrounded him. He saw their bodies bending over  him, the frosty tendrils of their faces writhing as though in excitement  or delight.    Their hands touched him. Little hands with seven fingers, deft and  frail. Even his numbed flesh felt the terrible cold of their touch,  freezing as outer space. He yelled, or tried to, but they were not  abashed.    They lifted him and bore him toward the tower, a company of them,  bearing his heavy weight upon their gleaming shoulders.    He saw the tower loom high and higher still above him. The cloud of dark  force that crowned it blotted out the stars. It became too huge and high  to see at all, and then there was a low flat arch of stone close above  his face, and he was inside.    Straight overhead--a hundred feet, two hundred, he could not tell--was a  globe of crystal, fitted into the top of the tower as a jewel is held in  a setting.    The air around it was shadowed with the same eerie gloom that hovered  outside, but less dense, so that Stark could see the smouldering purple  spark that burned within the globe, sending out its dark vibrations.    A globe of crystal, with a heart of sullen flame. Stark remembered the  sword of Ban Cruach, and the white fire that burned in its hilt.    Two globes, the bright-cored and the dark. The sword of Ban Cruach  touched the blood with heat. The globe of the tower deadened the flesh  with cold. It was the same force, but at opposite ends of the spectrum.    Stark saw the cryptic controls of that glooming globe--a bank of them,  on a wide stone ledge just inside the tower, close beside him. There  were shining ones on that ledge tending those controls, and there were  other strange and massive mechanisms there too.    Flying spirals of ice climbed up inside the tower, spanning the great  stone well with spidery bridges, joining icy galleries. In some of those  galleries, Stark vaguely glimpsed rigid, gleaming figures like statues  of ice, but he could not see them clearly as he was carried on.    He was being carried downward. He passed slits in the wall, and knew  that the pallid lights he had seen through them were the moving bodies  of the creatures as they went up and down these high-flung, icy bridges.  He managed to turn his head to look down, and saw what was beneath him.    The well of the tower plunged down a good five hundred feet to bedrock,  widening as it went. The web of ice-bridges and the spiral ways went  down as well as up, and the creatures that carried him were moving  smoothly along a transparent ribbon of ice no more than a yard in width,  suspended over that terrible drop.    Stark was glad that he could not move just then. One instinctive start  of horror would have thrown him and his bearers to the rock below, and  would have carried Ciara with them.    Down and down, gliding in utter silence along the descending spiral  ribbon. The great glooming crystal grew remote above him. Ice was solid  now in the slots of the walls. He wondered if they had brought Balin  this way.    There were other openings, wide arches like the one they had brought  their captives through, and these gave Stark brief glimpses of broad  avenues and unguessable buildings, shaped from the pellucid ice and  flooded with the soft radiance that was like eerie moonlight.    At length, on what Stark took to be the third level of the city, the  creatures bore him through one of these archways, into the streets  beyond.           *       *       *       *       *    Below him now was the translucent thickness of ice that formed the floor  of this level and the roof of the level beneath. He could see the  blurred tops of delicate minarets, the clustering roofs that shone like  chips of diamond.    Above him was an ice roof. Elfin spires rose toward it, delicate as  needles. Lacy battlements and little domes, buildings star-shaped,  wheel-shaped, the fantastic, lovely shapes of snow-crystals, frosted  over with a sparkling foam of light.    The people of the city gathered along the way to watch, a living,  shifting rainbow of amethyst and rose and green, against the pure  blue-white. And there was no least whisper of sound anywhere.    For some distance they went through a geometric maze of streets. And  then there was a cathedral-like building all arched and spired,  standing in the center of a twelve-pointed plaza. Here they turned, and  bore their captives in.    Stark saw a vaulted roof, very slim and high, etched with a glittering  tracery that might have been carving of an alien sort, delicate as the  weavings of spiders. The feet of his bearers were silent on the icy  paving.    At the far end of the long vault sat seven of the shining ones in high  seats marvellously shaped from the ice. And before them, grey-faced,  shuddering with cold and not noticing it, drugged with a sick horror,  stood Balin. He looked around once, and did not speak.    Stark was set on his feet, with Ciara beside him. He saw her face, and  it was terrible to see the fear in her eyes, that had never shown fear  before.    He himself was learning why men went mad beyond the Gates of Death.    Chill, dreadful fingers touched him expertly. A flash of pain drove down  his spine, and he could stand again.    The seven who sat in the high seats were motionless, their bright  tendrils stirring with infinite delicacy as though they studied the  three humans who stood before them.    Stark thought he could feel a cold, soft fingering of his brain. It came  to him that these creatures were probably telepaths. They lacked organs  of speech, and yet they must have some efficient means of  communications. Telepathy was not uncommon among the many races of the  Solar System, and Stark had had experience with it before.    He forced his mind to relax. The alien impulse was instantly stronger.  He sent out his own questing thought and felt it brush the edges of a  consciousness so utterly foreign to his own that he knew he could never  probe it, even had he had the skill.    He learned one thing--that the shining faceless ones looked upon him  with equal horror and loathing. They recoiled from the unnatural human  features, and most of all, most strongly, they abhorred the warmth of  human flesh. Even the infinitesimal amount of heat radiated by their  half-frozen human bodies caused the ice-folk discomfort.    Stark marshalled his imperfect abilities and projected a mental question  to the seven.    \"What do you want of us?\"    The answer came back, faint and imperfect, as though the gap between  their alien minds was almost too great to bridge. And the answer was one  word.    \"_Freedom!_\"    Balin spoke suddenly. He voiced only a whisper, and yet the sound was  shockingly loud in that crystal vault.    \"They have asked me already. Tell them no, Stark! Tell them no!\"    He looked at Ciara then, a look of murderous hatred. \"If you turn them  loose upon Kushat, I will kill you with my own hands before I die.\"    Stark spoke again, silently, to the seven. \"I do not understand.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Again the struggling, difficult thought. \"We are the old race, the kings  of the glacial ice. Once we held all the land beyond the mountains,  outside the pass you call the Gates of Death.\"    Stark had seen the ruins of the towers out on the moors. He knew how far  their kingdom had extended.    \"We _controlled_ the ice, far outside the polar cap. Our towers  blanketed the land with the dark force drawn from Mars itself, from the  magnetic field of the planet. That radiation bars out heat, from the  Sun, and even from the awful winds that blow warm from the south. So  there was never any thaw. Our cities were many, and our race was great.    \"Then came Ban Cruach, from the south....    \"He waged a war against us. He learned the secret of the crystal globes,  and learned how to reverse their force and use it against us. He,  leading his army, destroyed our towers one by one, and drove us back....    \"Mars needed water. The outer ice was melted, our lovely cities crumbled  to nothing, so that creatures like Ban Cruach might have water! And our  people died.    \"We retreated at the last, to this our ancient polar citadel behind the  Gates of Death. Even here, Ban Cruach followed. He destroyed even this  tower once, at the time of the thaw. But this city is founded in polar  ice--and only the upper levels were harmed. Even Ban Cruach could not  touch the heart of the eternal polar cap of Mars!    \"When he saw that he could not destroy us utterly, he set himself in  death to guard the Gates of Death with his blazing sword, that we might  never again reclaim our ancient dominion.    \"That is what we mean when we ask for freedom. We ask that you take away  the sword of Ban Cruach, so that we may once again go out through the  Gates of Death!\"    Stark cried aloud, hoarsely, \"_No!_\"    He knew the barren deserts of the south, the wastes of red dust, the  dead sea bottoms--the terrible thirst of Mars, growing greater with  every year of the million that had passed since Ban Cruach locked the  Gates of Death.    He knew the canals, the pitiful waterways that were all that stood  between the people of Mars and extinction. He remembered the yearly  release from death when the spring thaw brought the water rushing down  from the north.    He thought of these cold creatures going forth, building again their  great towers of stone, sheathing half a world in ice that would never  melt. He thought of the people of Jekkara and Valkis and Barrakesh, of  the countless cities of the south, watching for the flood that did not  come, and falling at last to mingle their bodies with the blowing dust.    He said again, \"No. Never.\"    The distant thought-voice of the seven spoke, and this time the question  was addressed to Ciara.    Stark saw her face.

[54] _Sewing Machine Times_ (Aug. 25, 1908), vol. 18, no. 418.    [55] Singer gives this limited description of the first machine, with  detailed improvements for which he was then applying for a patent: \"In  my previous machine, to which reference has been made, the bobbin was  carried by the needle-carrier, and hence the motion of the needle had to  be equal to the length of thread required to form the loop, which was  objectionable, as in many instances this range of motion was  unnecessarily long for all other purposes....\" Quoted from U.S. patent  8,294 issued to Isaac M. Singer, Aug. 12, 1851. It should be noted that  in some instances there was a considerable lapse of time from the date a  patent application was made until the patent was issued. In this case  the handwritten specifications were dated March 14, 1851, and the formal  Patent Office receipt was dated April 16, 1851.    [56] If a patent was not approved, for any reason, the records were  placed in an \"Abandoned File.\" In 1930 Congress authorized the disposal  of the old \"Abandoned Files,\" requiring them to be kept for twenty years  only. There are no Singer Company records giving an account of the first  patent application.    [57] Its whereabouts was unknown as early as 1908, as stated in the  _Sewing Machine Times_ (Aug. 25, 1908), vol. 18, no. 418. Models of  abandoned patents frequently remained at the Patent Office.  Approximately 76,000 models were ruined in a Patent Office fire in 1877.  In 1908 over 3000 models of abandoned patents were sold at auction.  Either incident could account for the machine's disappearance.    [58] The patent model of 8,294 is a machine that bears the serial number  22; it was manufactured before April 18, 1851, the date it was recorded  as received by the Patent Office.    [59] William R. Bagnall, in \"Contributions to American Economic  History,\" vol. 1 (1908), MS, Harvard School of Business Library.    [60] Singer purchased Phelps' interest in the company in 1851 and sold  it to Edward Clark.    [61] This first, family sewing machine should not be confused in name  with a model brought out in the sixties. The name of this first, family  machine was in the sense of a new \"family\" sewing machine. In 1859 a  \"Letter A\" family machine was introduced. Thus in 1865 when the Singer  Company brought out another family machine they called it the \"New\"  Family Sewing Machine. Both the first-style Family machine and the  Letter A machine are illustrated in _Eighty Years of Progress of the  United States_ (New York, 1861), vol. 2, p. 417, and discussed in an  article, \"The Place and Its Tenants,\" in the _Sewing Machine Times_  (Dec. 25, 1908), vol. 27, no. 893.
