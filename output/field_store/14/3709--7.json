[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/348"],[0,"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica (#11)"],[1," your ears from getting wet, for the dawn is chill when  Boreas has once made his onslaught, and at dawn a fruitful mist is  spread over the earth from starry heaven upon the fields of blessed men:  it is drawn from the ever flowing rivers and is raised high above the  earth by windstorm, and sometimes it turns to rain towards evening, and  sometimes to wind when Thracian Boreas huddles the thick clouds. Finish  your work and return home ahead of him, and do not let the dark cloud  from heaven wrap round you and make your body clammy and soak your  clothes. Avoid it; for this is the hardest month, wintry, hard for sheep  and hard for men. In this season let your oxen have half their usual  food, but let your man have more; for the helpful nights are long.  Observe all this until the year is ended and you have nights and days  of equal length, and Earth, the mother of all, bears again her various  fruit.    (ll. 564-570) When Zeus has finished sixty wintry days after the  solstice, then the star Arcturus [1325] leaves the holy stream of  Ocean and first rises brilliant at dusk. After him the shrilly wailing  daughter of Pandion, the swallow, appears to men when spring is just  beginning. Before she comes, prune the vines, for it is best so.    (ll. 571-581) But when the House-carrier [1326] climbs up the plants  from the earth to escape the Pleiades, then it is no longer the season  for digging vineyards, but to whet your sickles and rouse up your  slaves. Avoid shady seats and sleeping until dawn in the harvest season,  when the sun scorches the body. Then be busy, and bring home your  fruits, getting up early to make your livelihood sure. For dawn takes  away a third part of your work, dawn advances a man on his journey and  advances him in his work,--dawn which appears and sets many men on their  road, and puts yokes on many oxen.    (ll. 582-596) But when the artichoke flowers [1327], and the chirping  grass-hopper sits in a tree and pours down his shrill song continually  from under his wings in the season of wearisome heat, then goats are  plumpest and wine sweetest; women are most wanton, but men are feeblest,  because Sirius parches head and knees and the skin is dry through heat.  But at that time let me have a shady rock and wine of Biblis, a clot of  curds and milk of drained goats with the flesh of an heifer fed in the  woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids; then also let me  drink bright wine, sitting in the shade, when my heart is satisfied  with food, and so, turning my head to face the fresh Zephyr, from the  everflowing spring which pours down unfouled thrice pour an offering of  water, but make a fourth libation of wine.    (ll. 597-608) Set your slaves to winnow Demeter's holy grain, when  strong Orion [1328] first appears, on a smooth threshing-floor in an  airy place. Then measure it and store it in jars. And so soon as you  have safely stored all your stuff indoors, I bid you put your bondman  out of doors and look out for a servant-girl with no children;--for a  servant with a child to nurse is troublesome. And look after the  dog with jagged teeth; do not grudge him his food, or some time the  Day-sleeper [1329] may take your stuff. Bring in fodder and litter so  as to have enough for your oxen and mules. After that, let your men rest  their poor knees and unyoke your pair of oxen.    (ll. 609-617) But when Orion and Sirius are come into mid-heaven,  and rosy-fingered Dawn sees Arcturus [1330], then cut off all the  grape-clusters, Perses, and bring them home. Show them to the sun ten  days and ten nights: then cover them over for five, and on the sixth  day draw off into vessels the gifts of joyful Dionysus. But when the  Pleiades and Hyades and strong Orion begin to set [1331], then remember  to plough in season: and so the completed year [1332] will fitly pass  beneath the earth.    (ll. 618-640) But if desire for uncomfortable sea-faring seize you; when  the Pleiades plunge into the misty sea [1333] to escape Orion's rude  strength, then truly gales of all kinds rage. Then keep ships no longer  on the sparkling sea, but bethink you to till the land as I bid you.  Haul up your ship upon the land and pack it closely with stones all  round to keep off the power of the winds which blow damply, and draw out  the bilge-plug so that the rain of heaven may not rot it. Put away  all the tackle and fittings in your house, and stow the wings of the  sea-going ship neatly, and hang up the well-shaped rudder over the  smoke. You yourself wait until the season for sailing is come, and then  haul your swift ship down to the sea and stow a convenient cargo in it,  so that you may bring home profit, even as your father and mine,  foolish Perses, used to sail on shipboard because he lacked sufficient  livelihood. And one day he came to this very place crossing over a  great stretch of sea; he left Aeolian Cyme and fled, not from riches and  substance, but from wretched poverty which Zeus lays upon men, and  he settled near Helicon in a miserable hamlet, Ascra, which is bad in  winter, sultry in summer, and good at no time.    (ll. 641-645) But you, Perses, remember all works in their season but  sailing especially. Admire a small ship, but put your freight in a large  one; for the greater the lading, the greater will be your piled gain, if  only the winds will keep back their harmful gales.    (ll. 646-662) If ever you turn your misguided heart to trading and with  to escape from debt and joyless hunger, I will show you the measures of  the loud-roaring sea, though I have no skill in sea-faring nor in ships;  for never yet have I sailed by ship over the wide sea, but only to  Euboea from Aulis where the Achaeans once stayed through much storm when  they had gathered a great host from divine Hellas for Troy, the land  of fair women. Then I crossed over to Chalcis, to the games of wise  Amphidamas where the sons of the great-hearted hero proclaimed and  appointed prizes. And there I boast that I gained the victory with a  song and carried off an handled tripod which I dedicated to the Muses of  Helicon, in the place where they first set me in the way of clear song.  Such is all my experience of many-pegged ships; nevertheless I will tell  you the will of Zeus who holds the aegis; for the Muses have taught me  to sing in marvellous song.    (ll. 663-677) Fifty days after the solstice [1334], when the season  of wearisome heat is come to an end, is the right time for me to go  sailing. Then you will not wreck your ship, nor will the sea destroy the  sailors, unless Poseidon the Earth-Shaker be set upon it, or Zeus, the  king of the deathless gods, wish to slay them; for the issues of good  and evil alike are with them. At that time the winds are steady, and  the sea is harmless. Then trust in the winds without care, and haul your  swift ship down to the sea and put all the freight on board; but make  all haste you can to return home again and do not wait till the time of  the new wine and autumn rain and oncoming storms with the fierce gales  of Notus who accompanies the heavy autumn rain of Zeus and stirs up the  sea and makes the deep dangerous.    (ll. 678-694) Another time for men to go sailing is in spring when a  man first sees leaves on the topmost shoot of a fig-tree as large as the  foot-print that a cow makes; then the sea is passable, and this is the  spring sailing time. For my part I do not praise it, for my heart does  not like it. Such a sailing is snatched, and you will hardly avoid  mischief. Yet in their ignorance men do even this, for wealth means life  to poor mortals; but it is fearful to die among the waves. But I bid you  consider all these things in your heart as I say. Do not put all your  goods in hallow ships; leave the greater part behind, and put the lesser  part on board; for it is a bad business to meet with disaster among  the waves of the sea, as it is bad if you put too great a load on your  waggon and break the axle, and your goods are spoiled. Observe due  measure: and proportion is best in all things.    (ll. 695-705) Bring home a wife to your house when you are of the right  age, while you are not far short of thirty years nor much above; this is  the right age for marriage. Let your wife have been grown up four years,  and marry her in the fifth. Marry a maiden, so that you can teach her  careful ways, and especially marry one who lives near you, but look  well about you and see that your marriage will not be a joke to your  neighbours. For a man wins nothing better than a good wife, and, again,  nothing worse than a bad one, a greedy soul who roasts her man without  fire, strong though he may be, and brings him to a raw [1335] old age.    (ll. 706-714) Be careful to avoid the anger of the deathless gods. Do  not make a friend equal to a brother; but if you do, do not wrong him  first, and do not lie to please the tongue. But if he wrongs you first,  offending either in word or in deed, remember to repay him double;  but if he ask you to be his friend again and be ready to give you  satisfaction, welcome him. He is a worthless man who makes now one and  now another his friend; but as for you, do not let your face put your  heart to shame [1336].    (ll. 715-716) Do not get a name either as lavish or as churlish; as a  friend of rogues or as a slanderer of good men.    (ll. 717-721) Never dare to taunt a man with deadly poverty which eats  out the heart; it is sent by the deathless gods. The best treasure a man  can have is a sparing tongue, and the greatest pleasure, one that moves  orderly; for if you speak evil, you yourself will soon be worse spoken  of.    (ll. 722-723) Do not be boorish at a common feast where there are many  guests; the pleasure is greatest and the expense is least [1337].    (ll. 724-726) Never pour a libation of sparkling wine to Zeus after dawn  with unwashen hands, nor to others of the deathless gods; else they do  not hear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#11)"],[1,"of the sacrifices, but this did not prevent their  continuing them as the indispensable means of appeasing the wrath or  conciliating the favour of the deities. To such a length was this  carried in India and Iran, that sacrifice finally came to be regarded as  a cosmic force, a creative act. The gods themselves sacrificed as a  means of creation, or of modifying the existing order of the world. This  idea of the intrinsic and magical virtue of sacrifice naturally re-acted  on the importance attached to the sufferings of the victim so  inseparably connected with it, until the latter came to be regarded as  amongst the prime conditions of an efficacious sacrifice. For the rest,  I need not do more than mention the notions of substitution, of  compensation, and of renunciation on the part of the sacrificer, which  so readily attach themselves to the idea of sacrifice, and represent its  moral aspects.    Now all these considerations will help us to understand both the fearful  intensity and the special significance of the practice of human  sacrifice established among the Aztecs. And here I must ask you to  harden your hearts for a few moments while I conduct you through this  veritable chamber of horrors.    The Mexican sacrifices were, in truth, of the most frightful  description. It was an axiom amongst the Aztecs that none but human  sacrifices were truly efficacious. They were continually making war in  order to get a supply of victims. They regarded the victim, when once  selected, as a kind of incarnation of the deity who was ultimately to  consume his flesh, or at any rate his heart. They retained the practice  of cannibalism as a religious rite, and, as though they had had some of  the Red-skins' blood in their veins, they refined upon the tortures  which they forced those victims, whom they had almost adored the moment  before, to undergo at last.    These victims were regularly selected a considerable time in advance.  They were vigilantly watched, but in other respects were well cared for  and fed with the choicest viands--in a word, fattened. There was not a  single festival upon which at least one of these victims was not  immolated, and in many cases great numbers of them were flung upon the  \"stone of sacrifices,\" where the priests laid their bosoms open, tore  out their hearts, and placed them, as the epitome of the men themselves,  in a vessel full of burning rezin or \"copal,\" before the statue of the  deity. Some few of these sacrifices it is my duty to describe to you.    For example: To celebrate the close of the annual rule of Tezcatlipoca,  which fell at the beginning of May, they set apart a year beforehand the  handsomest of the prisoners of war captured during the preceding year.  They clothed him in a costume resembling that of the image of the god.  He might come and go in freedom, but he was always followed by eight  pages, who served at once as an escort and a guard. As he passed, I will  not say that the people either knelt or did not kneel before him, for in  Mexico the attitude expressive of religious adoration was that of  squatting down upon the haunches. As he passed, then, the people  squatted all along the streets as soon as they heard the sound of the  bells that he carried on his hands and feet. Twenty days before the  festival, they redoubled their care and attention. They bathed him,  anointed him with perfume, and gave him four beautiful damsels as  companions, each one bearing the name of a goddess, and all of them  instructed to leave nothing undone to make their divine spouse as happy  as possible. He then took part in splendid banquets, surrounded by the  great Mexican nobles. But the day before the great festival, they placed  him and his four wives on board a royal canoe and carried them to the  other side of the lake. In the evening the four goddesses quitted their  unhappy god, and his eight guardians conducted him to a lonely  _teocalli_, a league distant, where he was flung upon the stone of  sacrifices and his heart torn from his bosom. He must disappear and die  with the god whom he represented, who must now make way for  Uitzilopochtli. This latter deity likewise had his human counterpart,  who had to lead a war-dance in his name before being sacrificed. He had  the grotesque privilege of choosing the hour of his own immolation, but  under the condition that the longer he delayed it the less would his  soul be favoured in the abode of Uitzilopochtli. For we must note that  in the Mexican order of ideas, though the flesh of the victims was  destined to feed the gods to whom they were sacrificed, their souls  became the blessed and favoured slaves or servants of these same gods.    Centeotl, or Toci, the goddess of the harvest, had her human sacrifices  also, but in this case a woman figured as protagonist. She, too, was  dressed like the goddess, and entrusted to the care of four midwives,  priestesses of Centeotl, who were commissioned to pet and amuse her. A  fortnight before the festival, they celebrated \"the arm dance\" before  her, in which the dancers, without moving their feet, perpetually raised  and lowered their arms, as a symbol of the vegetation fixed at its  roots, but moving freely above. Then she had to take part in a mock  combat, after which she received the title of \"image of the mother of  the gods.\" The day before her execution, she went to pay what was called  her \"farewell to the market,\" in which she was conducted to the market  of Mexico, sowing maize all along the street as she went, and reverenced  by the people as Toci, \"our grandmother.\" But the following midnight she  was carried to the top of a teocalli, perched upon the shoulders of a  priest, and swiftly decapitated. Then they flayed her without loss of  time. The skin of the trunk was chopped off, and a priest, wrapping  himself in the bleeding spoil, traversed the streets in procession, and  made pretence of fighting with soldiers who were interspersed in the  cortege. The skin of the legs was carried to the temple of Centeotl, the  son, where another priest made himself a kind of mask with it, to  represent his god, and sacrificed four captives in the ordinary way.  After this, the priest, accompanied by some soldiers, bore the hideous  shreds to a point on the frontier, where they were buried as a talisman  to protect the empire.    The festivals of Tlaloc, god of rain, were perhaps yet more horrible. At  one of them they sacrificed a number of prisoners of war, one upon  another, clothed like the god himself. They tore out their hearts in the  usual way, and then carried them in procession, enclosed in a vase, to  throw them into a whirlpool of the lake of Mexico, which they imagined  to be one of the favoured residences of the aquatic deity. But it was  worse still at the festival of this same Tlaloc which fell in February.  On this occasion a number of young children were got together, and  decked with feathers and precious stones. They put wings upon them, to  enable them to fly up, and then placed them on litters, and bore them  through the city in grand procession and with the sound of trumpets. The  people, says Sahagun,[21] could not choose but weep to see these poor  little ones led off to the sacrifice. But if the children themselves  cried freely, it was all the better, for it was a sign that the rain  would be abundant.[22]    I will not try your nerves by dwelling much longer on this dismal  subject, though there is no lack of material. At the feast of Xipe, \"the  flayed,\" for example, whole companies of men were wrapped in the skins  of sacrificed captives, and engaged in mock battles in that costume. But  the only further instance I am compelled to mention is connected with  the festival of the god of fire, Xiuhtecutli, which was celebrated with  elaborate ceremonies. At set of sun, all who had prisoners of war or  slaves to offer to the deity brought forward their victims, painted  with the colours of the god, danced along by their side, and shut them  up in a building attached to the teocalli of Fire. Then they mounted  guard all round, singing hymns. At midnight, each owner entered and  severed a lock of the hair of his slave or slaves, to be carefully  preserved as a talisman. At daybreak they brought out the victims and  led them to the foot of the temple stair. There the priests took them  upon their shoulders and carried them up to the higher platform, where  they had prepared a great brazier of burning embers. Here each priest  flung his human burden upon the fire, and I leave you to imagine the  indescribable scene that ensued. Nor is this all. The same priests,  armed with long hooks, fished out the poor wretches before they were  quite roasted to death, and despatched them in the usual fashion on the  stone of sacrifices.[23]    It was after these offerings of private devotion that family and  friendly gatherings were held, at which a part of the victim's flesh was  eaten, under the idea that by thus sharing the food of the deity his  worshippers entered into a closer union with him. We ought, however, to  note that a master never ate the flesh of his own slave, inasmuch as he  had been his guest, and as it were a member of his family. He waited  till his friends returned his attention.      II.    Human sacrifice, Gentlemen, appears to have been a universal practice;  but wherever the human sympathies developed themselves rapidly, it was  early superseded by various substituted rites which it was supposed  might with advantage replace it. Such were flagellation, mutilation of  some unessential part of the body, or the emission of a certain quantity  of blood. This last practice, in particular, might be regarded as an act  of individual devotion, a gift made to the gods by the worshipper  himself out of his own very substance. The priesthood of Quetzalcoatl,  who had little taste for human sacrifices, seem to have introduced this  method of"]]]
