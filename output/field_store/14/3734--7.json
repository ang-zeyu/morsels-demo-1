Its history, (#11)"],[1,"as to the causes and origin of the typhus in horned cattle;  and that the chief organs of the press in every country--those ephemeral  encyclopaedias in which unfortunately so much vital force and  intelligence are dissipated--have published articles of the highest  interest on this subject. It would be physically impossible for me to  begin again a bibliographical labour similar to the one exhibited in the  First Part, in order to afford due justice to each of these public  writers, who have met the epizootia on the confines of their country and  fought hand to hand with it. This work is not susceptible of so much  enlargement. Let it be well understood, that I claim no other merit than  that of discussing these questions of etiology, in that order and with  that common sense which fix ideas firmly in the mind--which, if I may  use the term, _photograph_ them on those parts of the brain allotted to  the memory and judgment; also of drawing from known and admitted facts  more rational and practical conclusions than those which have been  current up to the present time.    Much has been already said and argued on the origin of the contagious  typhus which affects the ox; some adhering exclusively to the special  conditions observable in the breed of those oxen which are reared and  fed on the steppes of Russia and Hungary; others, more reasonably, as it  seems to us, ascribing it to the hygienic conditions generally, that is  to say, to the climate, the season, the feeding, &c., &c., amidst which  these animals are living.    All these discussions upon what has been said and argued on this subject  have been very useful. For, had it been rigidly proved that the oxen of  the steppes, by some peculiar organization, carry within them those  germs or physiological elements which at given times become the leaven  of the distemper, and, at a subsequent period, the elements of the  contagion, then, indeed, a fact of capital importance and prominent  authority would have been established, and the attention of all men  interested in these inquiries would have been exclusively concentrated  on that particular race of animals and on those countries smitten with  the curse, in order to arrest and confine the disease within its one and  only focus.    The supporters of this theory, concerning the first circumscribed origin  of the typhus, maintain that all the epizootics whose deplorable history  we have given in the first part of this work, have had no other  generative causes than the propagation of the complaint, born and  begotten on the banks of the Wolga and the Danube, and subsequently  conveyed to the different parts of the earth by the emigration of the  cattle. And in this manner, too, they have accounted for the appearance  of the typhus in South America, in Africa, and in Asia.    Since this doctrine on the origin of the typhus has been conceived and  maintained by men of a high order of understanding, we must suppose that  they had been struck and convinced by important facts and serious  reasons; and as it would be unfair to oppose a plain denial to an  opinion now so generally adopted, we are bound to say in what manner  these authors justify their views, after which we shall endeavour to  refute them.    The partisans of the circumscribed origin, who make it depend  exclusively on the peculiar organization of the race of the steppes,  have based their argument, peremptory and unanswerable as they imagine,  on the prime fact, that it has always been possible to trace the  diffusion of the typhus in a given country, to some sick animal of the  steppes conveyed to that kingdom. In this manner it is, that they  explain the generation of the epizootics which have so frequently wasted  the continent of Europe. On whatever point of the globe they may appear,  this, and only this, is the source of their existence. The isolated  position of Great Britain is made to support their arguments. \"Behold,\"  they exclaim, \"Great Britain, which, thanks to its surrounding seas, has  escaped most of the epizootics which have desolated France and Germany  during the early part of the nineteenth century.\" Nay, more, the present  visitation of the distemper is also seized upon to sustain their theory,  since certain oxen, natives of the steppes, appear to have imported it  into London.    We must add, that nothing is wanting in order to prove this assertion;  for they relate with perfect regularity, and step by step, the course  taken by the contagion; they specify the time occupied on its passage,  and even the names of the infected vessels which have thus imported the  principle of the typhus.    It must be admitted that all the facts thus stated are indisputable; we  acknowledge as true, that the bovine race of the steppes has conveyed  into other countries the contagious germs of the disease; we admit that  its dissemination may be thus accounted for.    But to admit this fact, and to draw from it the conclusion that the  bovine race of the steppes alone is capable, by some particular and  distinct organization, of developing the original typhus of the ox, and  that this typhus has no other focus on the earth than the banks of the  Dnieper and the Don, does not appear to us a sound logical deduction.  And as, if this conclusion were positively recognised, we might see but  one side of the evil, and deduce very serious consequences therefrom, it  is necessary to receive these facts for what they are worth, and no  more.    Let us first observe, that those writers who ascribe the contagious  typhus to the race of Southern Russia, do not take into consideration  the epizootics of this typhus, the account of which has been handed down  to us by the ancient authors of Greece and Rome; and that they refer  just as little to those which are quite as frequent in the republics of  South America as on the banks of the Dnieper. For even if we allow that  once, and only once, one of these epizootics may be traced to the  arrival of a ship containing oxen brought from the steppes, how, on the  other hand, can we believe that all other epizootics have had such a  fortuitous cause to generate it; consequently, the typhus, in these  cases, must have been locally developed and diffused among American  cattle?    Moreover, we seek in vain for the reasons which would authorize us to  assign to the bovine race of the steppes a particular organization,  rendering it alone fit to engender the typhus. But let us grant for a  moment, that the Russian and Hungarian oxen constitute a peculiar race,  as their framework and the length of their horns would seem to imply;  this much being conceded, it still remains to be shown in what respect  their anatomical and physiological structure differs from that of other  animals to such an extent as to render them alone liable to originate  this fatal typhus.    Oh! if it were true that the bovine race of the steppes alone could  engender the typhus! we would hail the fact with joy, and would show  without much exertion of reasoning that, in that case, we possessed not  only the means of preventing the disease by inoculating sound and  healthy cattle, but the far more important means of sweeping it for ever  from the earth, by at once exterminating that cursed race, smitten with  the original predisposition of this plague; and as, after all, the  murderous scourge of the typhus of the steppes has already cost, and may  perhaps continue to cost the various nations of the Old World millions  upon millions, they would feel that their most urgent interest would be  to come to an understanding (nor would the sacrifice be too much for  their resources) so as to destroy and extirpate the evil at its original  source. There would then be no difficulty in raising up a new breed of  cattle in those countries, by transporting to it those of other nations  free from the infection.    But who does not understand that this heroic sacrifice would be  illusory, and that the foreign races, modified in time in this new  medium, would regenerate the typhus; so that the double sacrifice of  extermination and indemnity would have been made to no purpose?    We wish we could adopt this hypothesis, so simple and so consolatory, of  the circumscribed origin of the typhus, and its exclusive propagation  through the race of the steppes; but our mind is altogether opposed to  that view, and for the following reasons, amongst others:--    If the bovine race of the steppes alone could produce the typhic virus,  by reason of a particular organization which is the prime condition of  its existence, _this race alone would of necessity be fit to receive its  taint_ by the influence of contagion. But if the other animals of the  same species, as unfortunately too surely happens, can receive the  principle of the disorder, develop the ailment, and die of its effects,  then the reasoning of our opponents is faulty from its source; and it  must be admitted that all horned cattle are apt to generate the typhic  virus in those countries which afford the conditions of its production,  and that this exclusive predisposition as it is called, attributed to  the race inhabiting the steppes, is simply a chimera.    But arguments are seldom exhausted even to defend a bad cause, and it is  objected that the fact that all oxen may contract the typhus transmitted  by the contact of animals from one to another, does not prove that the  original predisposition is the same in every race; and they persist in  maintaining--1st, that the typhus of the steppes is alone able  originally to beget the disease; 2nd, that having thus begotten and  produced it, it becomes, after this organic conception, apt to be  transmitted to every animal, and fit to be assimilated with them.    To these subtleties and argumentative refinements it would be as easy  for me to oppose abstract reasonings equally strong, as it would have  been for the Jansenists and Mollinists, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#11)"],[1,"on two factors--the number of spicules present, and the  amount of spongin. In _Corvospongilla lapidosa_ the number of spicules  is very large indeed. They are not arranged so as to form a reticulate  skeleton but interlock in all directions, and there is hardly any  spongin associated with them. In _Spongilla crassissima_, on the other  hand, the number of spicules although large is not unusually so; but  they form a very definitely reticulate skeleton, and are bound together  by an unusually profuse secretion of spongin. In _S. carteri_ var.  _mollis_ both spicules and spongin are reduced to a minimum, and the  parenchyma is relatively more bulky than usual.      VARIATION.    Sponges are very variable organisms, and even a slight change in the  environment of the freshwater species often produces a considerable  change in form and structure. Some species vary in accordance with the  season, and others without apparent cause. Not only have many given rise  to subspecies and \"varieties\" that possess a certain stability, but most  if not all are liable to smaller changes that apparently affect both the  individual and the breed, at any rate for a period.    (a) _Seasonal Variation._    Weltner has shown in a recent paper (Arch. Natg. Berlin, lxxiii (i), p.  276, 1907) that in Europe those individuals of _Ephydatia_ which are  found (exceptionally) in an active condition in winter differ  considerably both as regards the number of their cells and their anatomy  from those found in summer. In Calcutta the majority of the individuals  of _Spongilla carteri_ that are found in summer have their external  surface unusually smooth and rounded, and contain in their parenchyma  numerous cells the protoplasm of which is gorged with liquid. These  cells give the whole sponge a faint pinkish tinge during life; but if it  is plunged in spirit, both the liquid in the cells and the spirit turn  rapidly of a dark brown colour. Specimens of _Spongilla crateriformis_  taken in a certain tank in Calcutta during the cold weather had the  majority of the skeleton-spicules blunt, while the extremities of the  gemmule-spicules were distinctly differentiated. Specimens of the same  species taken from the same tank in July had the skeleton-spicules  pointed, while the extremities of the gemmule-spicules were much less  clearly differentiated. I have been unable to confirm this by  observations made on sponges from other tanks, but it would certainly  suggest that at any rate the breed of sponges in the tank first  investigated was liable to seasonal variation.    (b) _Variation due directly to Environment._    The characteristic external form of freshwater sponges is liable in most  cases to be altered as a direct result of changes in the environment.  The following are two characteristic instances of this phenomenon.    Certain shrubs with slender stems grow in the water at the edge of  Igatpuri Lake. The stems of these shrubs support many large examples of  _Spongilla carteri_, which are kept in almost constant motion owing to  the action of the wind on those parts of the shrubs that are not under  water. The surface of the sponges is so affected by the currents of  water thus set up against it that it is covered with deep grooves and  high irregular ridges like cockscombs. Less than a hundred yards from  the lake there is a small pond in which _Spongilla carteri_ is also  abundant. Here it grows on stones at the bottom and has the  characteristic and almost smooth form of the species.    My second instance also refers in part to Igatpuri Lake. _Corvospongilla  lapidosa_ is common in the lake on the lower surface of stones, and also  occurs at Nasik, about thirty miles away, on the walls of a conduit of  dirty water. In the latter situation it has the form of large sheets of  a blackish colour, with the surface corrugated and the oscula  inconspicuous, while in the clear waters of the lake it is of a pale  yellowish colour, occurs in small lichenoid patches, and has its oscula  rendered conspicuous, in spite of their minute size, by being raised on  little conical eminences in such a way that they resemble the craters of  volcanoes in miniature.    Both the European and the Indian races of _Spongilla lacustris_ fail to  develop branches if growing in unfavourable conditions. In specimens  obtained from the River Spree near Berlin these structures are sometimes  many inches in length; while in mature specimens taken under stones in  Loch Baa in the Island of Mull the whole organism consisted of a minute  cushion-shaped mass less than an inch in diameter, and was also  deficient in spicules. Both these breeds belong to the same species, and  probably differ as a direct result of differences in environment.    (c) _Variation without apparent cause._    Plate I in this volume illustrates an excellent example of variation in  external form to which it is impossible to assign a cause with any  degree of confidence. The three specimens figured were all taken in the  same pond, and at the same season, but in different years. It is  possible that the change in form, which was not peculiar to a few  individuals but to all those in several adjacent ponds, was due to a  difference in the salinity of the water brought about by a more or less  abundant rainfall; but of this I have been able to obtain no evidence in  succeeding years.    Many Spongillidae vary without apparent cause as regards the shape, size,  and proportions of their spicules. This is the case as regards most  species of _Euspongilla_ and _Ephydatia_, and is a fact to which careful  consideration has to be given in separating the species.      NUTRITION.    Very little is known about the natural food of freshwater sponges,  except that it must be of an organic nature and must be either in a very  finely divided or in a liquid condition. The cells of the sponge seem to  have the power of selecting suitable food from the water that flows past  them, and it is known that they will absorb milk. The fact that they  engulf minute particles of silt does not prove that they lack the power  of selection, for extraneous matter is taken up by them not only as food  but in order that it may be eliminated. Silt would soon block up the  canals and so put a stop to the vital activity of the sponge, if it were  not got rid of, and presumably it is only taken into the cells in order  that they may pass it on and finally disgorge it in such a way or in  such a position that it may be carried out of the oscula. The siliceous  part of it may be used in forming spicules.    It is generally believed that the green corpuscles play an important  part in the nutrition of those sponges in which they occur, and there  can be no doubt that these bodies have the power peculiar to all  organisms that produce chlorophyll of obtaining nutritive substances  direct from water and carbonic oxide through the action of sunlight.  Possibly they hand on some of the nourishment thus obtained to the  sponges in which they live, or benefit them by the free oxygen given out  in the process, but many Spongillidae do well without them, even when  living in identical conditions with species in which they abound.      REPRODUCTION.    Both eggs and buds are produced by freshwater sponges (the latter rarely  except by one species), while their gemmules attain an elaboration of  structure not observed in any other family of sponges.    Probably all Spongillidae are potentially monoecious, that is to say,  able to produce both eggs and spermatozoa. In one Indian species,  however, in which budding is unusually common (viz. _Spongilla  proliferens_), sexual reproduction takes place very seldom, if ever. It  is not known whether the eggs of sponges are fertilized by spermatozoa  from the individual that produces the egg or by those of other  individuals, but not improbably both methods of fertilization occur.    The egg of a freshwater sponge does not differ materially from that of  other animals. When mature it is a relatively large spherical cell  containing abundant food-material and situated in some natural cavity of  the sponge. In the earlier stages of its growth, however, it exhibits  amoeboid movements, and makes its way through the common jelly. As it  approaches maturity it is surrounded by other cells which contain  granules of food-material. The food-material is apparently transferred  by them in a slightly altered form to the egg. The egg has no shell, but  in some species (e. g. _Ephydatia blembingia_[N]) it is surrounded,  after fertilization, by gland-cells belonging to the parent sponge,  which secrete round it a membrane of spongin. Development goes on within  the chamber thus formed until the larva is ready to assume a free life.         [Footnote N: Rec. Ind. Mus. i, p. 269 (1907).]    The spermatozoon is also like that of other animals, consisting of a  rounded head and a lash-like tail, the movements of which enable it to  move rapidly through the water. Spermatozoa are produced in _Spongilla_  from spherical cells not unlike the eggs in general appearance. The  contents of these cells divide and subdivide in such a way that they  finally consist of a mass of spermatozoa surrounded by a single covering  cell, which they finally rupture, and so escape.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Diagram of a vertical section through the  gemmule of _Spongilla proliferens_.    A=cellular contents; B=internal chitinous layer; C=external chitinous  layer; D=pneumatic coat; E=gemmule-spicule; F=external membrane;  G=foraminal tubule.]    Gemmules are asexual reproductive bodies peculiar to the sponges, but  not to the Spongillidae. They resemble the statoblasts of the  phylactolaematous polyzoa in general structure as well as in function,  which is mainly that of preserving the race from destruction by such  agencies as drought, starvation, and temperatures that are either too  high or too low for its activities.
