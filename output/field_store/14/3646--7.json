The bulk of air in the body and neck of the matrass,  and in the bell-glass, reduced to a medium of 28 inches of the  barometer and 10 deg. (54.5 deg.) of the thermometer, at the commencement  of the experiment was about 50 cubical inches. At the end of the  experiment the remaining air, reduced to the same medium pressure and  temperature, was only between 42 and 43 cubical inches; consequently it  had lost about 1/6 of its bulk. Afterwards, having collected all the  red particles, formed during the experiment, from the running mercury  in which they floated, I found these to amount to 45 grains.    I was obliged to repeat this experiment several times, as it is  difficult in one experiment both to preserve the whole air upon which we  operate, and to collect the whole of the red particles, or calx of  mercury, which is formed during the calcination. It will often happen in  the sequel, that I shall, in this manner, give in one detail the results  of two or three experiments of the same nature.    The air which remained after the calcination of the mercury in this  experiment, and which was reduced to 5/6 of its former bulk, was no  longer fit either for respiration or for combustion; animals being  introduced into it were suffocated in a few seconds, and when a taper  was plunged into it, it was extinguished as if it had been immersed into  water.    In the next place, I took the 45 grains of red matter formed during this  experiment, which I put into a small glass retort, having a proper  apparatus for receiving such liquid, or gasseous product, as might be  extracted: Having applied a fire to the retort in a furnace, I observed  that, in proportion as the red matter became heated, the intensity of  its colour augmented. When the retort was almost red hot, the red matter  began gradually to decrease in bulk, and in a few minutes after it  disappeared altogether; at the same time 41-1/2 grains of running  mercury were collected in the recipient, and 7 or 8 cubical inches of  elastic fluid, greatly more capable of supporting both respiration and  combustion than atmospherical air, were collected in the bell-glass.    A part of this air being put into a glass tube of about an inch  diameter, showed the following properties: A taper burned in it with a  dazzling splendour, and charcoal, instead of consuming quietly as it  does in common air, burnt with a flame, attended with a decrepitating  noise, like phosphorus, and threw out such a brilliant light that the  eyes could hardly endure it. This species of air was discovered almost  at the same time by Mr Priestley, Mr Scheele, and myself. Mr Priestley  gave it the name of _dephlogisticated air_, Mr Scheele called it  _empyreal air_. At first I named it _highly respirable air_, to which  has since been substituted the term of _vital air_. We shall presently  see what we ought to think of these denominations.    In reflecting upon the circumstances of this experiment, we readily  perceive, that the mercury, during its calcination, absorbs the  salubrious and respirable part of the air, or, to speak more strictly,  the base of this respirable part; that the remaining air is a species of  mephitis, incapable of supporting combustion or respiration; and  consequently that atmospheric air is composed of two elastic fluids of  different and opposite qualities. As a proof of this important truth, if  we recombine these two elastic fluids, which we have separately obtained  in the above experiment, viz. the 42 cubical inches of mephitis, with  the 8 cubical inches of respirable air, we reproduce an air precisely  similar to that of the atmosphere, and possessing nearly the same power  of supporting combustion and respiration, and of contributing to the  calcination of metals.    Although this experiment furnishes us with a very simple means of  obtaining the two principal elastic fluids which compose our atmosphere,  separate from each other, yet it does not give us an exact idea of the  proportion in which these two enter into its composition: For the  attraction of mercury to the respirable part of the air, or rather to  its base, is not sufficiently strong to overcome all the circumstances  which oppose this union. These obstacles are the mutual adhesion of the  two constituent parts of the atmosphere for each other, and the elective  attraction which unites the base of vital air with caloric; in  consequence of these, when the calcination ends, or is at least carried  as far as is possible, in a determinate quantity of atmospheric air,  there still remains a portion of respirable air united to the mephitis,  which the mercury cannot separate. I shall afterwards show, that, at  least in our climate, the atmospheric air is composed of respirable and  mephitic airs, in the proportion of 27 and 73; and I shall then discuss  the causes of the uncertainty which still exists with respect to the  exactness of that proportion.    Since, during the calcination of mercury, air is decomposed, and the  base of its respirable part is fixed and combined with the mercury, it  follows, from the principles already established, that caloric and light  must be disengaged during the process: But the two following causes  prevent us from being sensible of this taking place: As the calcination  lasts during several days, the disengagement of caloric and light,  spread out in a considerable space of time, becomes extremely small for  each particular moment of that time, so as not to be perceptible; and,  in the next place, the operation being carried on by means of fire in a  furnace, the heat produced by the calcination itself becomes confounded  with that proceeding from the furnace. I might add the respirable part  of the air, or rather its base, in entering into combination with the  mercury, does not part with all the caloric which it contained, but  still retains a part of it after forming the new compound; but the  discussion of this point, and its proofs from experiment, do not belong  to this part of our subject.    It is, however, easy to render this disengagement of caloric and light  evident to the senses, by causing the decomposition of air to take place  in a more rapid manner. And for this purpose, iron is excellently  adapted, as it possesses a much stronger affinity for the base of  respirable air than mercury. The elegant experiment of Mr Ingenhouz,  upon the combustion of iron, is well known. Take a piece of fine iron  wire, twisted into a spiral, (BC, Plate IV. Fig. 17.) fix one of its  extremities B into the cork A, adapted to the neck of the bottle DEFG,  and fix to the other extremity of the wire C, a small morsel of tinder.  Matters being thus prepared, fill the bottle DEFG with air deprived of  its mephitic part; then light the tinder, and introduce it quickly with  the wire upon which it is fixed, into the bottle which you stop up with  the cork A, as is shown in the figure (17 Plate IV.) The instant the  tinder comes into contact with the vital air it begins to burn with  great intensity; and, communicating the inflammation to the iron-wire,  it too takes fire, and burns rapidly, throwing out brilliant sparks,  which fall to the bottom of the vessel in rounded globules, which become  black in cooling, but retain a degree of metallic splendour. The iron  thus burnt is more brittle even than glass, and is easily reduced into  powder, and is still attractable by the magnet, though not so powerfully  as it was before combustion. As Mr Ingenhouz has neither examined the  change produced on iron, nor upon the air by this operation, I have  repeated the experiment under different circumstances, in an apparatus  adapted to answer my particular views, as follows.    Having filled a bell-glass (A, Plate IV. Fig. 3.) of about six pints  measure, with pure air, or the highly respirable part of air, I  transported this jar by means of a very flat vessel, into a quicksilver  bath in the bason BC, and I took care to render the surface of the  mercury perfectly dry both within and without the jar with blotting  paper. I then provided a small capsule of china-ware D, very flat and  open, in which I placed some small pieces of iron, turned spirally, and  arranged in such a way as seemed most favourable for the combustion  being communicated to every part. To the end of one of these pieces of  iron was fixed a small morsel of tinder, to which was added about the  sixteenth part of a grain of phosphorus, and, by raising the bell-glass  a little, the china capsule, with its contents, were introduced into the  pure air. I know that, by this means, some common air must mix with the  pure air in the glass; but this, when it is done dexterously, is so very  trifling, as not to injure the success of the experiment. This being  done, a part of the air is sucked out from the bell-glass, by means of a  syphon GHI, so as to raise the mercury within the glass to EF; and, to  prevent the mercury from getting into the syphon, a small piece of paper  is twisted round its extremity. In sucking out the air, if the motion of  the lungs only be used, we cannot make the mercury rise above an inch or  an inch and a half; but, by properly using the muscles of the mouth, we  can, without difficulty, cause it to rise six or seven inches.    I next took an iron wire, (MN, Plate IV. Fig. 16.) properly bent for the  purpose, and making it red hot in the fire, passed it through the  mercury into the receiver, and brought it in contact with the small  piece of phosphorus attached to the tinder. The phosphorus instantly  takes fire, which communicates to the tinder, and from that to the iron.  When the pieces have been properly arranged, the whole iron burns, even  to the last particle, throwing out a white brilliant light similar to  that of Chinese fireworks. The great heat produced by this combustion  melts the iron into round globules of different sizes, most of which  fall into the China cup; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#11)"],[1,".    We, in this age, do not see the beauty of that dog.  We are too familiar  with it.  It is like the sunset and the stars: we are not awed by their  loveliness because they are common to our eyes.  So it is with that china  dog.  In 2288 people will gush over it.  The making of such dogs will  have become a lost art.  Our descendants will wonder how we did it, and  say how clever we were.  We shall be referred to lovingly as \"those grand  old artists that flourished in the nineteenth century, and produced those  china dogs.\"    The \"sampler\" that the eldest daughter did at school will be spoken of as  \"tapestry of the Victorian era,\" and be almost priceless.  The  blue-and-white mugs of the present-day roadside inn will be hunted up,  all cracked and chipped, and sold for their weight in gold, and rich  people will use them for claret cups; and travellers from Japan will buy  up all the \"Presents from Ramsgate,\" and \"Souvenirs of Margate,\" that may  have escaped destruction, and take them back to Jedo as ancient English  curios.    At this point Harris threw away the sculls, got up and left his seat, and  sat on his back, and stuck his legs in the air.  Montmorency howled, and  turned a somersault, and the top hamper jumped up, and all the things  came out.    I was somewhat surprised, but I did not lose my temper.  I said,  pleasantly enough:    \"Hulloa! what's that for?\"    \"What's that for?  Why--\"    No, on second thoughts, I will not repeat what Harris said.  I may have  been to blame, I admit it; but nothing excuses violence of language and  coarseness of expression, especially in a man who has been carefully  brought up, as I know Harris has been.  I was thinking of other things,  and forgot, as any one might easily understand, that I was steering, and  the consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the  tow-path.  It was difficult to say, for the moment, which was us and  which was the Middlesex bank of the river; but we found out after a  while, and separated ourselves.    Harris, however, said he had done enough for a bit, and proposed that I  should take a turn; so, as we were in, I got out and took the tow-line,  and ran the boat on past Hampton Court.  What a dear old wall that is  that runs along by the river there!  I never pass it without feeling  better for the sight of it.  Such a mellow, bright, sweet old wall; what  a charming picture it would make, with the lichen creeping here, and the  moss growing there, a shy young vine peeping over the top at this spot,  to see what is going on upon the busy river, and the sober old ivy  clustering a little farther down!  There are fifty shades and tints and  hues in every ten yards of that old wall.  If I could only draw, and knew  how to paint, I could make a lovely sketch of that old wall, I'm sure.  I've often thought I should like to live at Hampton Court.  It looks so  peaceful and so quiet, and it is such a dear old place to ramble round in  the early morning before many people are about.    But, there, I don't suppose I should really care for it when it came to  actual practice.  It would be so ghastly dull and depressing in the  evening, when your lamp cast uncanny shadows on the panelled walls, and  the echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridors, and now  drew nearer, and now died away, and all was death-like silence, save the  beating of one's own heart.    We are creatures of the sun, we men and women.  We love light and life.  That is why we crowd into the towns and cities, and the country grows  more and more deserted every year.  In the sunlight--in the daytime, when  Nature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and  the deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has  gone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome, and  we get frightened, like children in a silent house.  Then we sit and sob,  and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human voices, and the  answering throb of human life.  We feel so helpless and so little in the  great stillness, when the dark trees rustle in the night-wind.  There are  so many ghosts about, and their silent sighs make us feel so sad.  Let us  gather together in the great cities, and light huge bonfires of a million  gas-jets, and shout and sing together, and feel brave.    [Picture: People at Hampton Maze] Harris asked me if I'd ever been in the  maze at Hampton Court.  He said he went in once to show somebody else the  way.  He had studied it up in a map, and it was so simple that it seemed  foolish--hardly worth the twopence charged for admission.  Harris said he  thought that map must have been got up as a practical joke, because it  wasn't a bit like the real thing, and only misleading.  It was a country  cousin that Harris took in.  He said:    \"We'll just go in here, so that you can say you've been, but it's very  simple.  It's absurd to call it a maze.  You keep on taking the first  turning to the right.  We'll just walk round for ten minutes, and then go  and get some lunch.\"    They met some people soon after they had got inside, who said they had  been there for three-quarters of an hour, and had had about enough of it.  Harris told them they could follow him, if they liked; he was just going  in, and then should turn round and come out again.  They said it was very  kind of him, and fell behind, and followed.    They picked up various other people who wanted to get it over, as they  went along, until they had absorbed all the persons in the maze.  People  who had given up all hopes of ever getting either in or out, or of ever  seeing their home and friends again, plucked up courage at the sight of  Harris and his party, and joined the procession, blessing him.  Harris  said he should judge there must have been twenty people, following him,  in all; and one woman with a baby, who had been there all the morning,  insisted on taking his arm, for fear of losing him.    Harris kept on turning to the right, but it seemed a long way, and his  cousin said he supposed it was a very big maze.    \"Oh, one of the largest in Europe,\" said Harris.    \"Yes, it must be,\" replied the cousin, \"because we've walked a good two  miles already.\"    Harris began to think it rather strange himself, but he held on until, at  last, they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that Harris's  cousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago.  Harris said: \"Oh,  impossible!\" but the woman with the baby said, \"Not at all,\" as she  herself had taken it from the child, and thrown it down there, just  before she met Harris.  She also added that she wished she never had met  Harris, and expressed an opinion that he was an impostor.  That made  Harris mad, and he produced his map, and explained his theory.    \"The map may be all right enough,\" said one of the party, \"if you know  whereabouts in it we are now.\"    Harris didn't know, and suggested that the best thing to do would be to  go back to the entrance, and begin again.  For the beginning again part  of it there was not much enthusiasm; but with regard to the advisability  of going back to the entrance there was complete unanimity, and so they  turned, and trailed after Harris again, in the opposite direction.  About  ten minutes more passed, and then they found themselves in the centre.    Harris thought at first of pretending that that was what he had been  aiming at; but the crowd looked dangerous, and he decided to treat it as  an accident.    Anyhow, they had got something to start from then.  They did know where  they were, and the map was once more consulted, and the thing seemed  simpler than ever, and off they started for the third time.    And three minutes later they were back in the centre again.    After that, they simply couldn't get anywhere else.  Whatever way they  turned brought them back to the middle.  It became so regular at length,  that some of the people stopped there, and waited for the others to take  a walk round, and come back to them.  Harris drew out his map again,  after a while, but the sight of it only infuriated the mob, and they told  him to go and curl his hair with it.  Harris said that he couldn't help  feeling that, to a certain extent, he had become unpopular.    They all got crazy at last, and sang out for the keeper, and the man came  and climbed up the ladder outside, and shouted out directions to them.  But all their heads were, by this time, in such a confused whirl that  they were incapable of grasping anything, and so the man told them to  stop where they were, and he would come to them.  They huddled together,  and waited; and he climbed down, and came in.    He was a young keeper, as luck would have it, and new to the business;  and when he got in, he couldn't find them, and he wandered about, trying  to get to them, and then _he_ got lost.  They caught sight of him, every  now and then, rushing about the other side of the hedge, and he would see  them, and rush to get to them, and they would wait there for about five  minutes, and then he would reappear again in exactly the same spot, and  ask them where they had been.    They had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from his dinner  before they got out.    Harris said he thought it was a very fine maze, so far as he was a judge;  and we agreed that we would try to get George to go into it, on our way  back.          CHAPTER VII.
