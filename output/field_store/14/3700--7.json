What the dickens are we going to do?\"    \"Don't bother,\" said Ricketts, from the depths of the lounge, where he  had been trying for some minutes to get a much-needed rest. \"I--I--er--I  haven't anything on hand, boys. Leave him to me. I'll take care of him.\"    \"I move we all meet here to-morrow,\" said Grantham, \"and see what's to  be done with the kid.\"    Ricketts rose up from the lounge, and started to speak, but he was  interrupted by the doctor.    \"Did any of you think to ask the little tad his name?\" he inquired.    \"That's where I come in, boys,\" said Ricketts. \"You needn't bother your  heads about his name or his to-morrow--I'll take care of both. You men  have provided him with the joys of to-day--pretty substantial joys, too,  as those of us who have helped him to enjoy them can testify. As a  hearthless old bachelor, bundleless and forlorn, I was unable to qualify  on the toy end of things, but when it comes to names, I'll give him one  as my contribution to his Christmas possessions.\"    \"Good for you, Billie!\" laughed Dobbleigh. \"Would you mind telling us  what it is to be, so that we can put him on our visiting lists?\"    \"Not in the least,\" returned Ricketts, with an affectionate glance at  the boy. \"He is to be known henceforth as William Ricketts, Junior.\"    \"_William Ricketts, Junior?_\" cried the others, almost in one voice.    \"Precisely,\" said Ricketts, turning and facing them. \"From now on you  fellows will have to quit putting it all over me because you have  children, and I haven't. I've come into a ready-made family--rather  unexpectedly, but there it is. It's mine, and I'm going to keep it. I've  been without one too long, and after what I have tasted this day I find  that I have acquired a thirst for paternity that can never be cured.  To-morrow I propose to adopt our small guest here formally by due  process of law.\"    \"But where do we come in on this?\" cried Grantham. \"It's bully of you,  old man, but we can't permit you to shoulder the whole burden of this  boy's--\"    \"Shut up, Gran!\" retorted Ricketts, with an affectation of fine scorn.  \"You and the rest of this bunch are nothing but a lot of blooming  uncles. And by the way, gentlemen,\" he added, with a courtly bow, \"I  thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your kindness to my son.  Good night.\"    And with that, six of the exiles passed out into the twilight, and  hurried back to their own firesides, leaving Ricketts to his own.    And that is why, too, that the club servants, when they came to make  their rounds that night before turning out the lights, were surprised to  find old Billie Ricketts lying fast asleep in the warm embrace of one of  the richly upholstered armchairs of the lounging room, before the  blazing log fire on the hearth, with a mite of a boy curled up in his  lap, his little red head snuggled close to the manly chest of his  protector, and a happy little smile upon his lips, that showed that his  dreams were sweet, and that in those arms he felt himself secure from  the trials of life.    There was that upon the faces of both that gave the watchers pause, and  they refrained from waking them, merely turning out the electric  lights, and tiptoeing softly out of the room, leaving the sleepers  bathed in the mellow glow of the dancing flames.    Two lonely hearts had come into their own in the House of the Seven  Santas!      THE END.

Whatever we may choose to believe, Siena, at this period,  could boast her Guido, who painted from the year 1221, but not entirely  in the manner of the Greeks, as we shall find under the Sienese school.  Lucca possessed in 1235 one Bonaventura Berlingieri. A San Francesco  painted by him still exists in the castle of Guiglia, not far from  Modena, which is described as a work of great merit for that age.[41]  There lived another artist about the year 1288, known by his production  of a crucifixion which he left at San Cerbone, a short distance from the  city with this inscription; \"_Deodatus filius Orlandi de Luca me  pinxit_, A. D. 1288.\" Margaritone of Arezzo was a disciple and imitator  of the Greeks, and by all accounts he must have been born several years  before Cimabue. He painted on canvas, and if we may credit Vasari, made  the first discovery of a method of rendering his pictures more durable,  and less liable to cracking. He extended canvas on the panel, laying it  down with a strong glue, made of shreds of parchment, and covered the  whole with a ground of gypsum, before he began to paint. He formed  diadems and other ornaments of plaster, giving them relief from gilding  and burnishing them. Some of his crucifixions remain in Arezzo, and one  of them is in the church of the Holy Cross at Florence, near another by  Cimabue; both are in the old manner, and not so different in point of  merit, but that Margaritone, however rude, may be pronounced as well  entitled as Cimabue to the name of painter.    While the neighbouring cities had made approaches towards the new style,  Florence, if we are to credit Vasari and his followers, was without a  painter; but subsequent to the year 1250 some Greek painters were  invited to Florence by the rulers of the city, for the express purpose  of restoring the art of painting in Florence, where it was rather wholly  lost than degenerated. To this assertion I have to oppose the learned  dissertation of Doctor Lami, which I have just commended. Lami observes,  that mention is made in the archives of the chapters of one Bartolommeo  who painted in 1236, and that the picture of the Annunciation of our  Lady, which is held in the highest veneration in the church of the  Servi, was painted about that period. It is retouched in some parts of  the drapery; it possesses, however, much originality, and for that age  is respectably executed. When I prepared my first edition I had no  knowledge of the work of Lami, which was not then published, and hence  was unable to proceed further than to refute the opinion of those who  ascribed this sacred figure to Cavallini, a pupil of Giotto. I reflected  that the style of Cavallini appeared considerably more modern in his  other works which I had examined at Assisi, and at Florence; yet,  various artists whom I consulted, and among others Signor Pacini, who  had copied the Annunciation, disputed with me this diversity of style. I  further adduced the form of the characters written there in a book,  _Ecce Virgo concipiet, &c._ which resemble those of the thirteenth  century; nor have they that profusion of lines which distinguishes the  German, commonly denominated the Gothic character, which Cavallini and  other pupils of Giotto always employed. I rejoice that the opinion of  Lami confirms my conjecture, and stamps its authenticity; and it seems  to me highly probable that the Bartolommeo, whom he indicates, is the  individual to whom the memorandums of the Servi ascribe the production  of their Annunciation about the year 1250. The same religious fraternity  preserve, among their ancient paintings, a Magdalen, which appears from  the design and inscription, a work of the thirteenth century; and we  might instance several coeval pictures that still exist in their  chapter house, and in other parts of the city.[42]    Having inserted these notices of ancient painters, and some others,  which will be found scattered throughout the work, I turn to Vasari, and  to the accusations laid to his charge. He is defended by Monsignor  Bottari in a note at the conclusion of the life of Margaritone, taken  from Baldinucci. He affirms, from his own observation, \"That though each  city had some painters, they were all as contemptible and barbarous as  Margaritone, who, if compared to Cimabue, is unworthy of the name of  painter.\" The examples already cited do not permit me to assent to this  proposition; even Bottari himself will scarcely allow me to do so, as he  observes, in another note on the life of Cimabue, \"That he was the first  who abandoned the manner of the Greeks, or at least who avoided it more  completely than any other artist.\" But if others, such as Guido,  Bonaventura, and Giunta, had freed themselves from it before his time,  why are they not recorded as the first, in point of time, by Vasari? Did  not their example open the new path to Cimabue? Did they not afford a  ray of light to reviving art? Were they not in painting what the two  Guidos were in poetry, who, however much surpassed by Dante, are  entitled to the first place in a history of our poets? Vasari would  therefore have acted better had he followed the example of Pliny, who  commences with the rude designers, Ardices of Corinth, and Telephanes of  Sicyon; he then minutely narrates the invention of Cleophantes the  Corinthian, who coloured his designs with burnt earth; next, that of  Eumarus the Athenian, who first represented the distinction of age and  sex. Then comes that of Cimon of Cleonae, who first expressed the various  attitudes of the head, and aimed at representing the truth, even in the  joints of the fingers and the folds of the garments. Thus, the merits of  each city, and every artist, appear in ancient history; and it seems to  me just, that the same should be done, as far as possible, in modern  history. These observations may, at present, suffice in regard to a  subject that has been made a source of complaint and dispute among many  writers.    Nevertheless it cannot be denied that there is no city to which painting  is more indebted than to Florence, nor any name more proper to mark an  epoch, whatever may be the opinion of Padre della Valle,[43] than that  of Cimabue. The artists whom I have before mentioned had few followers;  their schools, with the exception of that of Siena, languished, and were  either gradually dispersed, or united themselves to that of Florence.  This school in a short time eclipsed every other, and has continued to  flourish in a proud succession of artists, uninterrupted even down to  our own days. Let us then trace it from its commencement.    Giovanni Cimabue, descended from illustrious ancestors,[44] was both an  architect and a painter. That he was the pupil of Giunta is conjectured  in our times, only because the Greeks were less skilful than the  Italians. It ought to be a previous question, whether the supposed  scholar and master ever resided in the same place, which it would seem,  after the observations before adduced, can scarcely be admitted.[45] It  appears from history, that he learnt the art from some Greeks who were  invited to Florence, and painted in S. Maria Novella, according to  Vasari. It is an error to assert that they painted in the chapel of the  Gondi, which was built a century after, together with the church; it was  certainly in another chapel, under the church, where those Greek  paintings were covered with plaister, and their place supplied by  others, the work of a painter of the thirteenth century.[46]    Not long since a part of the new plaister fell down, and some of the  very rude figures of those Greek painters became again visible. It is  probable that Cimabue imitated them in early life, and perhaps at that  time painted the S. Francesco and the little legends which surround it  in the church of S. Croce. But, if I mistake not, it is doubtful who  painted this picture; at least it neither has the manner nor the  colouring of the works of Cimabue, even when young. I may refer to the  S. Cecilia, with the implements of her martyrdom, in the church  dedicated to that Saint, and which was afterwards removed to that of San  Stefano, a picture greatly superior to that of S. Francesco.    However this may be, like other Italians of his age, Giovanni got the  better of his Greek education, which seems to have consisted in one  artist copying another without ever adding any thing to the practice of  his master. He consulted nature, he corrected in part the rectilinear  forms of his design, he gave expression to the heads, he folded the  drapery, and he grouped the figures with much greater art than the  Greeks. His talent did not consist in the graceful. His Madonnas have no  beauty, his angels in the same piece have all the same forms. Wild as  the age in which he lived, he succeeded admirably in heads full of  character, especially in those of old men, impressing an indescribable  degree of bold sublimity, which the moderns have not been able greatly  to surpass. Vast and inventive in conception, he executed large  compositions, and expressed them in grand proportions. His two great  altar-pieces of the Madonna, at Florence, the one in the church of the  Dominicans, the other in that of the Trinity, with the grand figures of  the prophets, do not give so good an idea of his style as his fresco  paintings in the church of Assisi, where he appears truly magnificent  for the age in which he lived. In these histories of the Old and New  Testament, such as remain, he appears an Ennius, who, amid the rudeness  of Roman epic poetry, gave flashes of genius not displeasing to a  Virgil. Vasari speaks of him with admiration for the vigour of his  colouring, and justly so of the pictures in the"]]]
