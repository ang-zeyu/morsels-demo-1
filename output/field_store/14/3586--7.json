Scarcely had Greek allied itself with  Hebrew thought, when Jews in Alexandria wrote Greek comparable with  Plato's, and not more than two hundred years after the settlement of  Jews in Arabia we meet with a large number of Jewish poets among  Mohammed's disciples, while in the middle ages they taught and wrote  Arabic, Spanish, French, and German--versatility naturally favorable to  intellectual progress.    Jewish influence may be said to have begun to exercise itself upon  general culture when Judaism and Hellenism met for the first time. The  result of the meeting was the new product, Judaeo-Hellenic literature.  Greek civilization was attractive to Jews. The new ideas were  popularized for all strata of the people to imbibe. Shortly before the  old pagan world crumbled, Hellenism enjoyed a beautiful, unexpected  revival in Alexandria. There, strange to say, Judaism, in its home  antagonistic to Hellenism, had filled and allied itself with the Greek  spirit. Its literature gradually adopted Greek traditions, and the ripe  fruit of the union was the Jewish-Alexandrian religious philosophy, the  mediation between two sharply contradictory systems, for the first time  brought into close juxtaposition, and requiring some such new element to  harmonize them. When ancient civilization in Judaea and in Hellas fell  into decay, human endeavor was charged with the task of reconciling  these two great historical forces diametrically opposed to each other,  and the first attempt looking to this end was inspired by a Jewish  genius, Jesus of Nazareth.    The Jews of Alexandria were engaged in widespread trade and shipping,  and they counted among them artists, poets, civil officers, and  mechanics. They naturally acquired Greek customs, and along with them  Hellenic vices. The bacchanalia of Athens were enthusiastically imitated  in Jerusalem, and, as a matter of course, in Alexandria. This point  reached, Roman civilization asserted itself, and the people sought to  affiliate with their Roman victors, while the rabbis devoted themselves  to the Law, not, however, to the exclusion of scientific work. In the  ranks of physicians and astronomers we find Jewish masters and Jewish  disciples. Medicine has always been held in high esteem by Jews, and  Samuel could justly boast before his contemporaries that the intricate  courses of the stars were as well known to him as the streets of  Nehardea in Babylonia.[22]    The treasures of information on pedagogics, medicine, jurisprudence,  astronomy, geography, zoology, botany, and last, though not least, on  general history, buried in the Talmud, have hitherto not been valued at  their true worth. The rabbis of the Talmud stood in the front ranks of  culture. They compiled a calendar, in complete accord with the Metonic  cycle, which modern science must declare faultless. Their classification  of the bones of the human body varies but little from present results of  the science of anatomy, and the Talmud demonstrates that certain Mishna  ordinances are based upon geometrical propositions, which could have  been known to but few mathematicians of that time. Rabbi Gamaliel, said  to have made use of a telescope, was celebrated as a mathematician and  astronomer, and in 289 C. E., Rabbi Joshua is reported to have  calculated the orbit of Halley's comet.    The Roman conquest of Palestine effected a change in the condition of  the Jews. Never before had Judah undergone such torture and suffering as  under the sceptre of Rome. The misery became unendurable, and internal  disorders being added to foreign oppression, the luckless insurrection  broke out which gave the deathblow to Jewish nationality, and drove  Judah into exile. On his thorny martyr's path he took naught with him  but a book--his code, his law. Yet how prodigal his contributions to  mankind's fund of culture!    About five hundred years later Judah saw springing up on his own soil a  new religion which appropriated the best and the most beautiful of his  spiritual possessions. Swiftly rose the vast political and intellectual  structure of Mohammedan power, and as before with Greek, so Jewish  thought now allied itself with Arabic endeavor, bringing forth in Spain  the golden age of neo-Hebraic literature in the spheres of poetry,  metaphysical speculation, and every department of scientific research.  It is not an exaggerated estimate to say that the middle ages sustained  themselves with the fruit of this intellectual labor, which, moreover,  has come down as a legacy to our modern era. Two hundred years after  Mohammed, the same language, Arabic, was spoken by the Jews of Kairwan  and those of Bagdad. Thus equipped, they performed in a remarkable way  the task allotted them by their talents and their circumstances, to  which they had been devoting themselves with singular zeal for two  centuries. The Jews are missioned mediators between the Orient and the  Occident, and their activity as such, illustrated by their additions to  general culture and science, is of peculiar interest. In the period  under consideration, their linguistic accomplishments fitted them to  assist the Syrians in making Greek literature accessible to the Arabic  mind. In Arabic literature itself, they attained to a prominent place.  Modern research has not yet succeeded in shedding light upon the  development and spread of science among the Arabs under the tutelage of  Syrian Christians. But out of the obscurity of Greek-Arabic culture  beginnings gleam Jewish names, whose possessors were the teachers of  eager Arabic disciples. Barely fifty years after the hosts of the  Prophet had conquered the Holy Land, a Jew of Bassora translated from  Syriac into Arabic the pandects by the presbyter Aaron, a famous medical  work of the middle ages. In the annals of the next century, among the  early contributors to Arabic literature, we meet with the names of Jews  as translators of medical, mathematical, and astronomical works, and as  grammarians, astronomers, scientists, and physicians. A Jew translated  Ptolemy's \"Almagest\"; another assisted in the first translation of the  Indian fox fables (_Kalila we-Dimna_); the first furnishing the middle  ages with the basis of their astronomical science, the second supplying  European poets with literary material. Through the instrumentality of  Jews, Arabs became acquainted as early as the eighth century, some time  before the learning of the Greeks was brought within their reach, with  Indian medicine, astronomy, and poetry. Greek science itself they owed  to Jewish mediation. Not only among Jews, but also among Greeks,  Syrians, and Arabs, Jewish versatility gave currency to the belief that  \"all wisdom is of the Jews,\" a view often repeated by Hellenists, by the  \"Righteous Brethren\" among the Arabs, and later by the Christian monks  of Europe.    The academies of the Jews have always been pervaded by a scientific  spirit. As they influenced others, so they permitted the science and  culture of their neighbors to act upon their life and work. There is no  doubt, for instance, that, despite the marked difference between the  subjects treated by Arabs and Jews, the peculiar qualities of the old  Arabic lyrics shaped neo-Hebraic poetry. Again, as the Hebrew acrostic  psalms demonstrably served as models to the older Syrian Church poets,  so, in turn, Syriac psalmody probably became the pattern synagogue  poetry followed. Thus Hebrew poetry completed a circuit, which, to be  sure, cannot accurately be followed up through its historical stages,  but which critical investigations and the comparative study of  literatures have established almost as a certainty.    In the ninth century a bold, venturesome traveller, Eldad ha-Dani,[23] a  sort of Jewish Ulysses, appeared among Jews, and at the same time  Judaism produced Sa'adia, its first great religious philosopher and  Bible translator. The Church Fathers had always looked up to the rabbis  as authorities; henceforth Jews were accepted by all scholars as the  teachers of Bible exegesis. Sa'adia was the first of the rabbis to  translate the Hebrew Scriptures into Arabic. Justly his work is said to  \"recognize the current of thought dominant in his time, and to express  the newly-awakened desire for the reconciliation of religious practice,  as developed in the course of generations, with the source of religious  inspiration.\" Besides, he was the first to elaborate a system of  religious philosophy according to a rigid plan, and in a strictly  scientific spirit.[24] Knowing Greek speculations, he controverts them  as vigorously as the _Kalam_ of Islam philosophy. His teachings form a  system of practical ethics, luminous reflections, and sound maxims.  Among his contemporaries was Isaac Israeli, a physician at Kairwan,  whose works, in their Latin translation by the monk Constantine,  attained great reputation, and were later plagiarized by medical  writers. His treatise on fever was esteemed of high worth, a translation  of it being studied as a text-book for centuries, and his dietetic  writings remained authoritative for five hundred years. In general, the  medical science of the Arabs is under great obligations to him.  Reverence for Jewish medical ability was so exaggerated in those days  that Galen was identified with the Jewish sage Gamaliel. The error was  fostered in the _Sefer Asaf_, a curious medical fragment of uncertain  authorship and origin, by its rehearsal of an old Midrash, which traces  the origin of medicine to Shem, son of Noah, who received it from  angels, and transmitted it to the ancient Chaldeans, they in turn  passing it on to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Arabs.    Though the birth of medicine is not likely to have taken place among  Jews, it is indisputable that physicians of the Jewish race are largely  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#11)"],[1,"soft; for during the dry months the  earth becomes so hard as to resist the poor implement used by the  natives in place of a spade.  The pit is concealed with much care, and  as months may pass without a hippopotamus straying into the trap, it may  be imagined how strong an effort of perseverance and patience is  required in capturing one of these amphibious creatures.    Another method of killing them is by suspending heavy pointed beams over  their paths, where they proceed from the river to the meadows adjoining.  These beams are elevated thirty or forty feet high, by a line which  extends across the sea-cow's track.  This line is connected with a  trigger, and when rudely dragged by the force of the moving body, the  beam descends upon the animal's back, burying the sharp point in its  flesh.    The use of fire-arms is now becoming general among the natives of  Africa; and, as the value of hippopotamus ivory well repays the trouble  of procuring it, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the ungainly  animal, now one of the commonest sights in the rivers of Southern  Africa, will soon become one of the rarest.        CHAPTER SIXTEEN.    HUNTING HIPPOPOTAMI.    The hippopotamus killed by Groot Willem and Hans was a fine specimen,--a  bull full-grown and with teeth and tusks large and perfect.    Measuring it with the barrel of his roer, Willem pronounced it to be  sixteen feet in length; and he estimated its circumference around the  body at but one foot less.    Leaving it where it had fallen, they rode to another part of the lagoon.  The fine hippopotami they had seen inspired them with a cheerful  prospect for the future,--as far as hunting that species of game was  concerned,--but a still brighter one was in store for them.    Not half a mile from where the first was killed, they reached a small  pool about four feet in depth.  Seven hippopotami were wallowing within  it, and others were seen grazing the low swampy ground not far-away.  They had been so little molested by man that they were not afraid of  feeding by daylight.  Those in the pool were wholly at the mercy of the  hunters; for they had not the courage to leave it; and the water was not  of sufficient depth either to conceal or protect them.    For nearly half an hour the four young hunters stood by the side of the  pool, loading and firing whenever a favourable opportunity presented.  The seven huge creatures were then left dead or dying, and the hunters  returned to their kraal.    Macora was waiting for them, having come over for the purpose of making  a \"morning call.\"  As a present to the young hunters, he had brought  them a milch cow, for which they were very thankful.    The cow was consigned to the keeping of Swartboy, who had strict  injunctions to look well after it.  \"That cow is worth more to us than  either of the horses,\" remarked Hendrik to the Bushman, \"and I would not  trust it to the keeping of Congo; but I know it will be safe with you.\"    Swartboy was delighted.    When Macora was told that they had that morning killed eight  hippopotami, he became roused to a state of tremendous excitement.  Two  of his attendants were despatched immediately to his village, to convey  the pleasing intelligence to his people, that an unlimited amount of  their favourite food was waiting for them.    Having done enough for one day, the hunters reposed in the shade of  their tent, until about two hours before sunset, when they were roused  by the arrival of nearly three hundred people, men, women, and children,  of Macora's tribe,--all anxious to be led to the bodies of the  hippopotami.    Groot Willem was afraid that the disturbance made by so many people  would drive every sort of game from the neighbourhood, and that they  would have to move their camp.  But knowing this argument would not be  strong enough to convince several hundred hungry people that so large a  quantity of good food should be wasted, no objection was made to  conducting them to the scene of the morning's sport.    Groot Willem and Hendrik, attended by Congo, were soon in their saddles  prepared for a night's shooting at the lagoon.  They started off,  accompanied by Macora and all his following, leaving Hans and Arend to  take care of the kraal.    On reaching the place where the first hippopotamus had been killed in  the morning, a flock of vultures and a pack of jackals were driven from  the carcass; and several of the natives stopped to prevent these  carnivora devouring any more of the animal's body, by appropriating it  to themselves.    Obeying the instructions of their chief, Macora's followers had brought  with them long and strong rheims,--that is, cords made of rhinoceros  hide,--and, on reaching the pool in which the seven dead hippopotami  were lying, Macora gave orders for the carcasses to be hauled out.    This work, under ordinary circumstances, would have been next to  impossible; but taking into consideration the flatness of the ground,  and the united strength of some hundred and fifty men capable of  handling a rope, the thing was soon accomplished.    The task of skinning and cutting up then commenced; while the women and  children kindled fires and made other preparations for a grand banquet.    Until a late hour of the night, the natives remained at work.  All the  flesh not required for immediate use was separated into long slips, to  be dried in the sun, and thus converted into _biltongue_, while the  whole of the teeth were to remain the property of those who had killed  the hippopotami.    The two hunters, Groot Willem and Hendrik, on that night had not far to  travel in order to obtain a sufficiency of their favourite sport.    Attracted by the odour of the slain pachyderms, lions, hyenas, and  jackals came prowling about the pool, loudly expressing their  disapprobation of the fact that they themselves had not been invited to  partake of the feast.  Notwithstanding the large number of human beings  collected upon the spot, the hyenas came close up, and, with deafening  roars, threatened to make an attack.    The guns of Groot Willem and Hendrik were, for a time, kept constantly  cracking, and the ugly brutes at length grew more wary, betaking  themselves to a safer distance.    The hunters had no desire to lose time or ammunition, in mere wanton  destruction of life.  They only desired to kill such game as might  contribute towards remunerating them for the long journey; and they soon  ceased firing at hyenas and jackals.  Leaving the pool, they walked  along the shore of the lagoon, towards the ground where they had seen  the hippopotami during the earlier hours of the day.    Night being the usual time for those animals to feed, the youths  calculated upon making an addition to the list of their prizes,--nor  were they disappointed.    Half a mile from the spot where Macora and his tribe had been left  feasting, was an open plain, lit by the beams of a brilliant moon.  Ten  or fifteen dark objects were seen moving slowly over its surface; and  leaning forward in their saddles, the hunters could see that they were  hippopotami.  They rode gently towards them.    The animals, entirely unacquainted with the dangerous character of those  who were approaching, neither stirred from the spot nor took any notice  of the horsemen, until the latter were within close range of them.    \"That seems to be one of the biggest of them,\" whispered Groot Willem,  pointing to a large bull that was browsing at less than a hundred paces  off.  \"I shall make sure of him.  You, Hendrik, take another, and let us  both fire together.\"    Willem, as he spoke, raised the heavy death-dealing roer to his  shoulder.  Taking aim for the centre of the head, he fired.  The next  moment, the monster was seen staggering backwards, drawing its shattered  head along the ground.    It was not thinking of a retreat to the water,--of retiring through fear  of further danger, or of anything else.  It was in the agonies of death!    This manner of action was not long sustained, for after trailing about  ten yards from where it was struck, it fell heavily on the earth and  turned over on one side, to move no more in life.    Hendrik had fired almost at the same instant of time; but for some  seconds, the creature to which his attention had been directed, made no  acknowledgment of the favour.  It started off, and, along with the  others, made straight towards the lagoon.    For a time, Hendrik was again chagrined to think that the rival hunter  had been more successful than himself.  His chagrin, however, was not  destined to long continuance; for on their way to the water, one of the  hippopotami was observed to tumble over in its tracks.    After loading their guns, the horsemen rode up to the prostrate animal  and found it struggling to rise.  The bullet from Hendrik's rifle had  entered its right shoulder; and another from the same gun now put a  period to its struggles as well as existence.    The two hunters, not yet contented with their success, took cover under  a cluster of trees; and, dismounting from their horses, lay in wait to  see if the hippopotami would again oblige them by coming out upon the  plain.  Neither in this watch were they disappointed.  Occasionally,  they could hear the harsh bellowing of the animals as they came to the  surface of the water, and before long, the bodies of three huge monsters  were seen moving slowly towards them.  Reserving fire until one came  within a few yards of their position, both hunters discharged their  pieces almost simultaneously.    With a cry that resembled the combined snorting of a hog and the  neighing of a horse, the \"zeekoe\" faced back towards the lagoon; but,  instead of moving off, it commenced turning slowly round and round, as a  dog may be sometimes seen to do before laying himself down to repose.  In a similar fashion did the hippopotamus lie down to rise no more.    Three others were shot on that same "]]]
