He held his hat in his  left hand to parry with, and his knife in front of him--that's their  Andalusian guard. I stood up in the Navarrese fashion, with my left arm  raised, my left leg forward, and my knife held straight along my right  thigh. I felt I was stronger than any giant. He flew at me like an  arrow. I turned round on my left foot, so that he found nothing in front  of him. But I thrust him in the throat, and the knife went in so far  that my hand was under his chin. I gave the blade such a twist that it  broke. That was the end. The blade was carried out of the wound by a  gush of blood as thick as my arm, and he fell full length on his face.    \"'What have you done?' said _El Dancaire_ to me.    \"'Hark ye,' said I, 'we couldn't live on together. I love Carmen and I  mean to be the only one. And besides, Garcia was a villain. I remember  what he did to that poor _Remendado_. There are only two of us left now,  but we are both good fellows. Come, will you have me for your friend,  for life or death?'    \"_El Dancaire_ stretched out his hand. He was a man of fifty.    \"'Devil take these love stories!' he cried. 'If you'd asked him for  Carmen he'd have sold her to you for a piastre! There are only two of us  now--how shall we manage for to-morrow?'    \"'I'll manage it all alone,' I answered. 'I can snap my fingers at the  whole world now.'    \"We buried Garcia, and we moved our camp two hundred paces farther on.  The next morning Carmen and her Englishman came along with two muleteers  and a servant. I said to _El Dancaire_:    \"'I'll look after the Englishman, you frighten the others--they're not  armed!'    \"The Englishman was a plucky fellow. He'd have killed me if Carmen  hadn't jogged his elbow.    \"To put it shortly, I won Carmen back that day, and my first words were  to tell her she was a widow.    \"When she knew how it had all happened--    \"'You'll always be a _lillipendi_,' she said. 'Garcia ought to have  killed you. Your Navarrese guard is a pack of nonsense, and he has sent  far more skilful men than you into the darkness. It was just that his  time had come--and yours will come too.'    \"'Ay, and yours too!--if you're not a faithful _romi_ to me.'    \"'So be it,' said she. 'I've read in the coffee grounds, more than once,  that you and I were to end our lives together. Pshaw! what must be, will  be!' and she rattled her castanets, as was her way when she wanted to  drive away some worrying thought.    \"One runs on when one is talking about one's self. I dare say all these  details bore you, but I shall soon be at the end of my story. Our new  life lasted for some considerable time. _El Dancaire_ and I gathered a  few comrades about us, who were more trustworthy than our earlier ones,  and we turned our attention to smuggling. Occasionally, indeed, I must  confess we stopped travellers on the highways, but never unless we were  at the last extremity, and could not avoid doing so; and besides, we  never ill-treated the travellers, and confined ourselves to taking their  money from them.    \"For some months I was very well satisfied with Carmen. She still served  us in our smuggling operations, by giving us notice of any opportunity  of making a good haul. She remained either at Malaga, at Cordova, or at  Granada, but at a word from me she would leave everything, and come to  meet me at some _venta_ or even in our lonely camp. Only once--it was at  Malaga--she caused me some uneasiness. I heard she had fixed her fancy  upon a very rich merchant, with whom she probably proposed to play her  Gibraltar trick over again. In spite of everything _El Dancaire_ said to  stop me, I started off, walked into Malaga in broad daylight, sought for  Carmen and carried her off instantly. We had a sharp altercation.    \"'Do you know,' said she, 'now that you're my _rom_ for good and all, I  don't care for you so much as when you were my _minchorro_! I won't be  worried, and above all, I won't be ordered about. I choose to be free to  do as I like. Take care you don't drive me too far; if you tire me  out, I'll find some good fellow who'll serve you just as you served _El  Tuerto_.'    \"_El Dancaire_ patched it up between us; but we had said things to each  other that rankled in our hearts, and we were not as we had been before.  Shortly after that we had a misfortune: the soldiers caught us, _El  Dancaire_ and two of my comrades were killed; two others were taken.  I was sorely wounded, and, but for my good horse, I should have fallen  into the soldiers' hands. Half dead with fatigue, and with a bullet in  my body, I sought shelter in a wood, with my only remaining comrade.  When I got off my horse I fainted away, and I thought I was going to  die there in the brushwood, like a shot hare. My comrade carried me to a  cave he knew of, and then he sent to fetch Carmen.    \"She was at Granada, and she hurried to me at once. For a whole  fortnight she never left me for a single instant. She never closed her  eyes; she nursed me with a skill and care such as no woman ever showed  to the man she loved most tenderly. As soon as I could stand on my feet,  she conveyed me with the utmost secrecy to Granada. These gipsy women  find safe shelter everywhere, and I spent more than six weeks in a house  only two doors from that of the _Corregidor_ who was trying to arrest  me. More than once I saw him pass by, from behind the shutter. At last I  recovered, but I had thought a great deal, on my bed of pain, and I had  planned to change my way of life. I suggested to Carmen that we should  leave Spain, and seek an honest livelihood in the New World. She laughed  in my face.    \"'We were not born to plant cabbages,' she cried. 'Our fate is to live  _payllos_! Listen: I've arranged a business with Nathan Ben-Joseph at  Gibraltar. He has cotton stuffs that he can not get through till you  come to fetch them. He knows you're alive, and reckons upon you. What  would our Gibraltar correspondents say if you failed them?'    \"I let myself by persuaded, and took up my vile trade once more.    \"While I was hiding at Granada there were bull-fights there, to which  Carmen went. When she came back she talked a great deal about a skilful  _picador_ of the name of Lucas. She knew the name of his horse, and how  much his embroidered jacket had cost him. I paid no attention to this;  but a few days later, Juanito, the only one of my comrades who was left,  told me he had seen Carmen with Lucas in a shop in the Zacatin. Then  I began to feel alarmed. I asked Carmen how and why she had made the  _picador's_ acquaintance.    \"'He's a man out of whom we may be able to get something,' said she.  'A noisy stream has either water in it or pebbles. He has earned twelve  hundred reals at the bull-fights. It must be one of two things: we  must either have his money, or else, as he is a good rider and a plucky  fellow, we can enroll him in our gang. We have lost such an one an such  an one; you'll have to replace them. Take this man with you!'    \"'I want neither his money nor himself,' I replied, 'and I forbid you to  speak to him.'    \"'Beware!' she retorted. 'If any one defies me to do a thing, it's very  quickly done.'    \"Luckily the _picador_ departed to Malaga, and I set about passing in  the Jew's cotton stuffs. This expedition gave me a great deal to do, and  Carmen as well. I forgot Lucas, and perhaps she forgot him too--for the  moment, at all events. It was just about that time, sir, that I met you,  first at Montilla, and then afterward at Cordova. I won't talk about  that last interview. You know more about it, perhaps, than I do. Carmen  stole your watch from you, she wanted to have your money besides, and  especially that ring I see on your finger, and which she declared to be  a magic ring, the possession of which was very important to her. We had  a violent quarrel, and I struck her. She turned pale and began to cry.  It was the first time I had ever seen her cry, and it affected me in the  most painful manner. I begged her to forgive me, but she sulked with me  for a whole day, and when I started back to Montilla she wouldn't kiss  me. My heart was still very sore, when, three days later, she joined me  with a smiling face and as merry as a lark. Everything was forgotten,  and we were like a pair of honeymoon lovers. Just as we were parting she  said, 'There's a _fete_ at Cordova; I shall go and see it, and then I  shall know what people will be coming away with money, and I can warn  you.'    \"I let her go. When I was alone I thought about the _fete_, and about  the change in Carmen's temper. 'She must have avenged herself already,'  said I to myself, 'since she was the first to make our quarrel up.' A  peasant told me there was to be bull-fighting at Cordova. Then my blood  began to boil, and I went off like a madman straight to the bull-ring. I  had Lucas pointed out to me, and on the bench, just beside the barrier,  I recognised Carmen. One glance at her was enough to turn my suspicion  into certainty. When the first bull appeared Lucas began, as I had  expected to play the agreeable; he snatched the cockade off the bull and  presented it to Carmen, who put it in her hair at once.*         * _La divisa_. A knot of ribbon, the colour of which       indicates the pasturage from which each bull comes. This       knot of ribbon is fastened into the bull's hide with a sort       of hook, and it is considered the very height of gallantry       to snatch it off the living beast and present it to a woman.    \"The bull avenged me. Lucas was knocked down, with his horse on his  chest, and the bull on top of both of them. I looked for Carmen, she had  disappeared from her place already. I couldn't get out of mine, and I  was obliged to wait until the bull-fight was over. Then I went off to  that house you already know, and waited there quietly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#11)"],[1,"the kind was exactly what poor  Michele had been dreading.  He turned to her and, almost choking with  despair, said, \"Misericordia,\" not meaning to be hostile, but that the  killing of her giant had already delayed him, and if he were to allow  himself to yield to her blandishments he would be too late for the  Saracens.  No doubt he also had a vow.  But when a lady has made up her  mind on a matter of this kind, to thwart her is to invite disaster--think  of Joseph and Potiphar's wife.  Not that Michele thought of them, nor  would it have influenced him if he had, for he was a paladin and  incapable of fear; but he had the instincts of a gentleman, so, in spite  of his anxiety to be off to the wars, he rose as well as he could, which  was unsteadily, and staggered towards the princess who made every effort  to meet him.  In time they drew close enough to fall into one another's  arms, and the curtain descended as they were accomplishing not a  passionate but a quite creditable embrace.    Then there was a scene between three kings with golden crowns who  conversed at length of battles and the King of Athens, of Adrianopoli and  the Grand Turk, of princesses and of journeys by sea and land.  These  were the things they spoke about as they stood together in the hall that  had served for the first scene with a vista of columns behind, and when  they had done they followed one another off.  Then we also followed one  another out of the theatre, not because of the Saracens, nor because we  had any vow, nor because we feared a repetition of the uproar, nor even  because of the coming-on disposition of the Princess of Bizerta, but  because one open window was not enough.          TRAPANI      CHAPTER VI--FERRAU AND ANGELICA      My next experience in a marionette theatre was at Trapani.  I approached  the subject with Mario, a coachman whom I have known since he was a boy.  He was quite ready to help me, and told me there were two companies in  the town, one of large puppets, about as high as my umbrella, the others,  to which he went every evening, being rather smaller.  Accordingly, at  about a quarter to eight, he called for me, wrapped in his melodramatic  cloak, and hurried me through the wet and windy streets to the teatrino.  He kept me on his right hand because he was the host and I the guest, and  if, owing to obstructions, he found me accidentally on his left he was  round in a moment and I was in the place of honour again.  He insisted on  paying for our seats, fifteen centimes each, and we went in.    This teatrino was in every way a much smaller place than that in Catania;  it belonged to a private gentleman who had bought the puppets for his own  amusement and spent much of his time among them, sometimes working them  himself.  He has since married and parted with them and the theatre is  now (1908) closed.  No complaint could be made about the seating  arrangements or the ventilation.  There were benches on the floor with a  passage down the middle, a few rows in front were reserved for boys at  ten centimes each and at the other end of the hall was a small gallery  for ladies, twenty centimes each.  I asked Mario so many questions that  he proposed we should go behind the scenes, which was exactly what I  wanted.  He spoke to one of the authorities, who was politeness itself  and, showing us through a door and up three steps, introduced us behind  the curtain.  Our heads were high above the opening of the proscenium,  which was about the size and shape of the opening of the fireplace in a  fairly large room.  We were in a grove of puppets hanging up against the  walls like turkeys in a poulterer's shop at Christmas--scores and scores  of them.  There were six or eight men preparing for the performance and a  youth, Pasquale, took charge of us and pointed out the principal figures.    \"This warrior,\" he said, \"is Ferrau di Spagna.\"    He was in tin armour, carefully made and enriched with brass and copper  ornamentation, all as bright as a biscuit-box.  I said--    \"He looks a very terrible fellow.  Why is he so red about the eyes?\" for  the whites of his eyes were redder than his cheeks.    \"Because he is always in a rage.  And this lady is Angelica, Empress of  Cathay; she wears a crown and will die this evening.  This is her  husband, Medoro; he is a black man and wears a crown; he will perish  to-night by the sword of Ferrau.\"    I rapidly constructed by anticipation the familiar plot.  The jealous  husband would kill his erring wife and would then be killed by her lover;  but, being unversed in the habits of Cathaian emperors and their  entourage, I had run off the track.  Pasquale put me straight.    \"Prima Ferrau uccide Medoro.\"  (Ferrau first kills Medoro.)    \"And then kills Angelica?\" I inquired.    \"No.  Angelica si uccide personalmente, so as not to marry Ferrau.\"    I was next introduced to Galafrone, the father of Angelica, who also wore  a crown, and to two valorous knights, Sacripante, King of the  Circassians, and the Duca d'Avilla.    There were more than two hundred marionettes altogether, including  Turkish and Spanish soldiers.  The knights and ladies were kept in green  holland bags to preserve them from the dust, and taken out as they were  wanted.  They varied in height from twenty-four to thirty-two inches.  Ferrau was thirty-one and a half inches from the soles of his feet to the  top of his helmet; Angelica was twenty-six and a half inches; ordinary  Turks and Spanish soldiers were only twenty-four inches each.    Pasquale was very proud of Ferrau who really was magnificent.  He was  made of wood with loose joints.  An iron rod went through his head, and  was hooked into a ring between his collar-bones.  Another rod was  fastened to his right wrist.  There were three strings--one for his left  hand, which held his shield, one to raise his vizor and one which passed  through his right fist and across his body to his sword-hilt so that he  could draw his sword.  I should have liked to buy him and bring him to  London with me; he would be an ornament to any house.  But he was not for  sale; and, besides, it would not have been right to break up the company.  When Don Quixote, carried away by his feelings like a Sicilian facchino,  came to the assistance of Don Gayferos by drawing his sword and attacking  the Moorish puppets, he broke up Master Peter's company in a very literal  sense, and had to pay four and a half reals for King Marsilio of  Saragossa and five and a quarter for the Emperor Carlo Magno; but it is  not clear how large or how splendid they were.    Each figure requires one operator who stands between the wings, which are  about up to his waist and so solid that he can lean his elbows on them  and reach comfortably more than halfway across the stage.  There are four  openings between the wings, and thus there can be eight puppets on the  stage at once, operated by eight manipulators, four on each side.  This  could not be done with the life-sized marionettes in Catania, which were  all operated from behind, and never came forward.  At Trapani the stage  was much deeper in proportion, and the flies from which the scenery  descended were high above the heads of the operators, so that the figures  could walk about backwards and forwards all over the stage.  The  footlights were in the usual place in front of the curtain, and during  the performance boys got up from their seats in the front row and lighted  their cigarettes at them.    I had not nearly completed my investigations; but, fearing we might be in  the way, we returned to the front and inquired about play-bills.  There  was only one in the house, posted up near the box-office; we went and  inspected it--                                TEATRO DI MARIONETTE.                            Per questa sera dara 2 recite                       la prima alle 5.5 la seconda alle 8                    Pugna fra Sacripante e il Duca d'Avilla--                    Ferrau uccide Medoro e acquista Angelica--                     Morte di Sacripante per mani di Ferrau--                                Morte di Angelica.                                 MARIONETTE THEATRE.                     This evening two performances will be given                        The first at 5.30, the second at 8                Fight between Sacripante and the Duke of Avilla--              Ferrau kills Medoro and gains possession of Angelica--                   Death of Sacripante at the hands of Ferrau--                                Death of Angelica.    There was a pleasant-looking, retiring young man in the box-office, who  was pointed out to me as \"Lui che parla\"--the one who speaks.  They said  he was a native of Mount Eryx and a shoemaker by trade.    We returned to our places and sat talking, smoking, eating American  pea-nuts and waiting.  The audience, which consisted of men of the class  of life to which Mario belonged, all knew one another; most of them met  there every evening.  A subscription for one month costs three lire and  entitles the holder to one performance a day, the performance at 8 being  a repetition of that at 5.30.    The play now being performed is _The Paladins of France_; it was written  by Manzanares in Italian prose and is in three volumes.  It does not  always agree with the other versions of the same story; but that is only  as it should be, for romances have always been re-written to suit the  audience they are intended for.  It has been going on about four months,  that is, since last October, when it began with Pipino, Re di Francia ed  Imperatore di Roma, the father of Carlo Magno, and it will continue day  after day till May, like the feuilleton in a journal.  During the hot  weather there is no performance in this theatre; but the same story will  be taken up again next October and is long enough to last through two  winters.  It could last longer, but they bring it within reasonable  limits by removing"]]]
