Hydras to show reproduction in one or both ways.    e. A section of hydra, showing details.      Comparative Study of Coelenterates          _Materials._    Various coelenterates, such as hydroids, hydro-medusae, jellyfishes,  sea anemones, corals, sea fans, etc. Since nearly all the  coelenterates except hydras are marine forms, these will usually  have to be dead specimens, preserved in formalin or alcohol, or put  up as permanent preparations for the microscope.          _Definitions._    _Colony_, as used in this group, a number of individuals descended by  budding from an original one, and remaining connected.    _Polyp_, an individual coelenterate; one of the individuals in a  colony.          _Observations._    1. How large is an individual specimen in the form you are studying?  If the form is colonial, how large is the colony or portion of a  colony you are studying? Estimate the number of individuals in it. Is  the colony free-swimming or attached? If attached, to what is it  usually fastened?    2. Compare the individual you are studying with a hydra, as to size  and shape of the body, the location of the mouth, and the size,  number, and arrangement of the tentacles.    3. Is there a skeleton? If so, describe it. What appears to be its  use? In corals, notice the radiating partitions.    4. Has the specimen any nettle cells? If so, where are they located?    5. Are all the polyps of the colony alike? If not, how many kinds are  there? How do they differ?      What is each kind best fitted to do? What is the probable result    of this differentiation?    6. What kinds of reproduction, if any, does the specimen you are  studying show?      Find out from books what other forms of reproduction are    sometimes used by this animal.          _Suggested drawings._    a. At least one drawing of each coelenterate you study.      Summary of the Comparative Study of Coelenterates      1. How may polyps in colonial forms differ from polyps which live  singly?    2. What variations in methods of reproduction are shown in this  group?    3. Which of the polyps you have studied shows the greatest  differentiation? In what ways?    4. What characteristic do you find common to all the coelenterates  you have studied?      Review and Library Exercise on Coelenterates      1. What are the characteristics which distinguish coelenterates?    2. Give the classes of coelenterates, with the characteristics and  an example of each.    3. What enables a hydra to stick to a support by its foot?    4. What are the processes in a hydra by which food is captured,  swallowed, and digested?    5. What is the chief fact of interest about Hydra viridis?    6. Why do hydras reproduce all summer by budding and in the late fall  by eggs?    7. What change would have developed a hydra and its offspring into a  plant-like colony instead of into a group of individuals?    8. Why are ctenophores more easily seen in the night than other  coelenterates are?    9. What relations may exist between hydroids and hydro-medusae?    10. What are the advantages of a sedentary life? Of a locomotory one?    11. What is meant by the expression \"alternation of generations\"?  Which animals are likely to develop alternation of generations,  sedentary ones or locomotory ones? Why?    12. Give at least two differences between hydro-medusae and true  jellyfishes.    13. In the association between a hydractinia colony and a hermit  crab, what advantages are derived by the hydractinia? by the crab?  Define symbiosis. Give another illustration of it.    14. How are new coral colonies started? How are large colonies  formed?    15. What are the conditions of life under which corals can grow  vigorously?    16. Where are corals most abundant?      _Note._--Show by coloring the regions on a blank map of the    world.    17. How may corals form a reef? Why do they, as a rule, form a reef  instead of adding directly to the mainland?    18. Give Darwin's theory regarding the way a coral atoll may have  been formed.    19. Where are fossil corals found in abundance? What does their  presence prove?    20. What is polymorphism? Give an illustration. What may be a  disadvantage of polymorphism? What may be an advantage?    21. In what ways is this group of economic importance?      4. A STUDY OF WORMS    _To show cells associated even more closely than in coelenterates,  forming tissues and systems of organs._      #A STUDY OF EARTHWORMS#      The Living Earthworm          _Materials._    Living earthworms, some of which are left undisturbed from day to  day, in damp earth with leaves of various plants scattered upon it.          _Definitions._    _Anterior end_, the head end, usually the leading end.    _Posterior end_, the end opposite the anterior end.    _Ventral surface_, the lower surface, usually the one which contains  the mouth.    _Dorsal surface_, the one opposite the ventral surface.    _Somites_, the rings or segments of which some animal bodies are  composed.    _Bilateral symmetry_, the symmetry usually shown by animals which  have differentiated dorsal and ventral surfaces, and right and left  sides. Animals which do not have such differentiated surfaces are  usually _radially symmetrical_, but sometimes asymmetrical (without  symmetry).    _Girdle_, the somewhat transparent band frequently found near the  anterior end of an earthworm.    _Anal opening_, the posterior opening of the food canal.    _Setae_ (singular form, _seta_), small bristles or stiff hairs. In  the earthworm these are set in the body wall at definite intervals,  and aid in locomotion.    _Cuticle_, in the earthworm a delicate, shining cover over the body.    _Egg capsules_, small, light-colored, spindle-shaped sacks, about the  size and somewhat the shape of a grain of wheat, containing the eggs  or young of earthworms.          _Directions._    Take a living earthworm to your table and keep it damp by placing it  in a wet tray or upon moist paper. Identify the anterior and  posterior ends, the dorsal and ventral surfaces, and the right and  left sides. Identify also the somites and the girdle, the mouth with  its projecting lip, and the anal opening.          _Observations._    1. Watch a living worm for some time. Does it seem to have a definite  object in its moving? If so, what is it? Upon what sense or senses  does it seem to depend for guidance? Which end usually leads? Why?    2. Over what sort of surface does it move most easily? Why? Watch it  closely for some time and discover how it is able to move from place  to place. (_Suggestion._ What is the function of the setae in this  process? How can you explain the alternate contraction and expansion  of parts?)    3. From time to time, for perhaps a week, examine the leaves which  were scattered where the worms could reach them. Have the worms moved  them about at all? If so, where are the leaves left? Have any been  eaten, in part or entirely? If so, is there any evidence of  selection, either as to the kind of leaf or the portion of leaf  eaten? If earthworms select food, what senses would be useful for the  purpose? Have you any evidence that earthworms possess such senses?    4. Looking through the dorsal wall, notice the meandering red line,  seen more easily in some regions than in others. This is the dorsal  blood vessel. How long is it? Where is it wider? Where narrower?  Notice its pulsations. How many times per minute does it pulsate? In  which direction is the blood forced? Is there a corresponding ventral  blood vessel? Place a small worm between two pieces of glass, so that  you may see through it more easily, and identify the blood vessels  encircling the digestive canal, near the anterior end. These are the  so-called \"hearts\" of the earthworm. If possible, decide in which  direction the blood flows through them.    5. The food canal, or alimentary canal, lies underneath the dorsal  blood vessel, and is usually easily seen, especially if it is full of  food. Notice it when the worm is fully stretched and again when it is  contracted. How long is the canal? Why does it wrinkle when the worm  contracts? Where does it open to the outside? Why does it need to?    6. Where do you infer respiration must take place in this animal? Why  do you think so? What fits this surface for such a purpose? Why does  an earthworm seem so uncomfortable when it is too dry?      7. Where do earthworms live? What conditions are necessary in    their habitat?      8. When do earthworms usually leave their burrows? Why at that    particular time rather than at another? Why does \"the early bird    catch the worm\"?      9. What enemies do earthworms have? How are they protected    against these enemies?      10. If you have found egg capsules when collecting worms,    describe them.      External Morphology of Earthworms          _Materials._    Preserved earthworms, the larger the better.          _Observations._    1. In what respects are the dorsal and ventral surfaces alike? In  what respects different? Why?    2. Why are the right and left sides alike?    3. In what respects are the two ends alike? In what different? Why?    4. How many somites are there from the anterior end to the girdle?  How many under the girdle? How many from the girdle to the posterior  end?    5. Where are the setae located in a somite? How are they distributed  over the body?          _Suggested drawings._    a.
