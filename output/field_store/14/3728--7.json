Andres went his ways, not very well pleased, you may be  sure, yet fully resolved to find out the valorous Don Quixote, and  give him an exact account of the whole transaction, that he might pay  the abuse with sevenfold usury: in short, he crept off sobbing and  weeping, while his master stayed behind laughing. And in this manner  was this wrong redressed by the valorous Don Quixote de la Mancha.    In the mean time the knight, being highly pleased with himself and  what had happened, imagining he had given a most fortunate and noble  beginning to his feats of arms, went on towards his village, and soon  found himself at a place where four roads met; and this made him  presently bethink of those cross-ways which often used to put  knights-errant to a stand, to consult with themselves which way they  should take. That he might follow their example, he stopped a while,  and after he had seriously reflected on the matter, gave Rozinante the  reins, subjecting his own will to that of his horse, who, pursuing his  first intent, took the way that led to his own stable.    Don Quixote had not gone above two miles, when he discovered a company  of people riding towards him, who proved to be merchants of Toledo,  going to buy silks in Murcia. They were six in all, every one screened  with an umbrella, besides four servants on horseback, and three  muleteers on foot. The knight no sooner perceived them but he imagined  this to be some new adventure; so, fixing himself in his stirrups,  couching his lance, and covering his breast with his target, he posted  himself in the middle of the road, expecting the coming up of the  supposed knights-errant. As soon as they came within hearing, with a  loud voice and haughty tone, \"Hold,\" cried he; \"let no man hope to  pass further, unless he acknowledge and confess that there is not in  the universe a more beautiful damsel than the empress of La Mancha,  the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\" At those words the merchants made a  halt, to view the unaccountable figure of their opponent; and  conjecturing, both by his expression and disguise, that the poor  gentleman had lost his senses, they were willing to understand the  meaning of that strange confession which he would force from them; and  therefore one of the company, who loved raillery, and had discretion  to manage it, undertook to talk to him. \"Signor cavalier,\" cried he,  \"we do not know this worthy lady you talk of; but be pleased to let us  see her, and then if we find her possessed of those matchless charms,  of which you assert her to be the mistress, we will freely, and  without the least compulsion, own the truth which you would extort  from us.\" \"Had I once shewn you that beauty,\" replied Don Quixote,  \"what wonder would it be to acknowledge so notorious a truth? the  importance of the thing lies in obliging you to believe it, confess  it, affirm it, swear it, and maintain it, without seeing her; and  therefore make this acknowledgment this very moment, or know that with  me you must join in battle, ye proud and unreasonable mortals! Come  one by one, as the laws of chivalry require, or all at once, according  to the dishonourable practice of men of your stamp; here I expect you  all my single self, and will stand the encounter, confiding in the  justice of my cause.\" \"Sir knight,\" replied the merchant, \"I beseech  you, that for the discharge of our consciences, which will not permit  us to affirm a thing we never heard or saw, and which, besides, tends  so much to the dishonour of the empresses and queens of Alcaria and  Estremadura, your worship will vouchsafe to let us see some  portraiture of that lady, though it were no bigger than a grain of  wheat; for by a small sample we may judge of the whole piece, and by  that means rest secure and satisfied, and you contented and appeased.  Nay, I verily believe, that we all find ourselves already so  inclinable to comply with you, that though her picture should  represent her to be blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and  brimstone at the other, yet to oblige you, we shall be ready to say in  her favour whatever your worship desires.\" \"Distil, ye infamous  scoundrels,\" replied Don Quixote in a burning rage, \"distil, say you?  know, that nothing distils from her but amber and civet; neither is  she defective in her make or shape, but more straight than a  Guadaramian spindle. But you shall all severely pay for the blasphemy  which thou hast uttered against the transcendent beauty of my  incomparable lady.\" Saying this, with his lance couched, he ran so  furiously at the merchant who thus provoked him, that had not good  fortune so ordered it that Rozinante should stumble and fall in the  midst of his career, the audacious trifler had paid dear for his  raillery: but as Rozinante fell, he threw down his master, who rolled  and tumbled a good way on the ground without being able to get upon  his legs, though he used all his skill and strength to effect it, so  encumbered he was with his lance, target, spurs, helmet, and the  weight of his rusty armour. However, in this helpless condition he  played the hero with his tongue; \"Stay,\" cried he; \"cowards, rascals,  do not fly! it is not through my fault that I lie here, but through  that of my horse, ye poltroons!\"    One of the muleteers, who was none of the best-natured creatures,  hearing the overthrown knight thus insolently treat his master, could  not bear it without returning him an answer on his ribs; and therefore  coming up to him as he lay wallowing, he snatched his lance, and  having broke it to pieces, so belaboured Don Quixote's sides with one  of them, that, in spite of his arms, he thrashed him like a  wheatsheaf. His master indeed called to him not to lay on him so  vigorously, and to let him alone; but the fellow, whose hand was in,  would not give over till he had tired out his passion and himself; and  therefore running to the other pieces of the broken lance, he fell to  it again without ceasing, till he had splintered them all on the  knight's iron enclosure. At last the mule-driver was tired, and the  merchants pursued their journey, sufficiently furnished with matter of  discourse at the poor knight's expense. When he found himself alone,  he tried once more to get on his feet; but if he could not do it when  he had the use of his limbs, how should he do it now, bruised and  battered as he was? But yet for all this, he esteemed himself a happy  man, being still persuaded that his misfortune was one of those  accidents common in knight-errantry, and such a one as he could wholly  attribute to the falling of his horse.          CHAPTER V.    _A further account of our Knight's misfortunes._      Don Quixote perceiving that he was not able to stir, resolved to have  recourse to his usual remedy, which was to bethink himself what  passage in his books might afford him some comfort: and presently his  frenzy brought to his remembrance the story of Baldwin and the Marquis  of Mantua, when Charlot left the former wounded on the mountain; a  story learned and known by little children, not unknown to young men  and women, celebrated, and even believed, by the old, and yet not a  jot more authentic than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him as  if made on purpose for his present circumstances, and therefore he  fell a rolling and tumbling up and down, expressing the greatest pain  and resentment, and breathing out, with a languishing voice, the same  complaints which the wounded Knight of the Wood is said to have made!      \"Alas! where are you, lady dear,      That for my woe you do not moan?    You little know what ails me here,      Or are to me disloyal grown.\"    Thus he went on with the lamentations in that romance, till he came to  these verses:--      \"O thou, my uncle and my prince,      Marquis of Mantua, noble lord!\"--    When kind fortune so ordered it that a ploughman, who lived in the  same village, and near his house, happened to pass by, as he came from  the mill with a sack of wheat. The fellow seeing a man lie at his full  length on the ground, asked him who he was, and why he made such a sad  complaint. Don Quixote, whose distempered brain presently represented  to him the countryman as the Marquis of Mantua, his imaginary uncle,  made him no answer, but went on with the romance. The fellow stared,  much amazed to hear a man talk such unaccountable stuff; and taking  off the vizor of his helmet, broken all to pieces with blows bestowed  upon it by the mule-driver, he wiped off the dust that covered his  face, and presently knew the gentleman. \"Master Quixada!\" cried he  (for so he was properly called when he had the right use of his  senses, and had not yet from a sober gentleman transformed himself  into a wandering knight); \"how came you in this condition?\" But the  other continued his romance, and made no answers to all the questions  the countryman put to him, but what followed in course in the book:  which the good man perceiving, he took off the battered adventurer's  armour as well as he could, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#11)"],[1,"we obey it while attacking it. Enclosed within a circle,  our mind revolves about itself, until a new observation, creating within  us new ideas, brings to view an external principle which delivers us  from the phantom by which our imagination is possessed.    Thus, we know to-day that, by the laws of a universal magnetism whose  cause is still unknown, two bodies (no obstacle intervening) tend to  unite by an accelerated impelling force which we call GRAVITATION. It is  gravitation which causes unsupported bodies to fall to the ground, which  gives them weight, and which fastens us to the earth on which we live.  Ignorance of this cause was the sole obstacle which prevented the  ancients from believing in the antipodes. \"Can you not see,\" said St.  Augustine after Lactantius, \"that, if there were men under our feet,  their heads would point downward, and that they would fall into the  sky?\" The bishop of Hippo, who thought the earth flat because it  appeared so to the eye, supposed in consequence that, if we should  connect by straight lines the zenith with the nadir in different places,  these lines would be parallel with each other; and in the direction  of these lines he traced every movement from above to below. Thence he  naturally concluded that the stars were rolling torches set in the vault  of the sky; that, if left to themselves, they would fall to the earth in  a shower of fire; that the earth was one vast plain, forming the lower  portion of the world, &c. If he had been asked by what the world itself  was sustained, he would have answered that he did not know, but that  to God nothing is impossible. Such were the ideas of St. Augustine in  regard to space and movement, ideas fixed within him by a prejudice  derived from an appearance, and which had become with him a general and  categorical rule of judgment. Of the reason why bodies fall his mind  knew nothing; he could only say that a body falls because it falls.    With us the idea of a fall is more complex: to the general ideas of  space and movement which it implies, we add that of attraction or  direction towards a centre, which gives us the higher idea of cause. But  if physics has fully corrected our judgment in this respect, we still  make use of the prejudice of St. Augustine; and when we say that a thing  has FALLEN, we do not mean simply and in general that there has been  an effect of gravitation, but specially and in particular that it is  towards the earth, and FROM ABOVE TO BELOW, that this movement has taken  place. Our mind is enlightened in vain; the imagination prevails, and  our language remains forever incorrigible. To DESCEND FROM HEAVEN is as  incorrect an expression as to MOUNT TO HEAVEN; and yet this expression  will live as long as men use language.    All these phrases--FROM ABOVE TO BELOW; TO DESCEND FROM HEAVEN; TO FALL  FROM THE CLOUDS, &C.--are henceforth harmless, because we know how to  rectify them in practice; but let us deign to consider for a moment how  much they have retarded the progress of science. If, indeed, it be a  matter of little importance to statistics, mechanics, hydrodynamics, and  ballistics, that the true cause of the fall of bodies should be known,  and that our ideas of the general movements in space should be exact,  it is quite otherwise when we undertake to explain the system of the  universe, the cause of tides, the shape of the earth, and its position  in the heavens: to understand these things we must leave the circle  of appearances. In all ages there have been ingenious mechanicians,  excellent architects, skilful artillerymen: any error, into which it was  possible for them to fall in regard to the rotundity of the earth and  gravitation, in no wise retarded the development of their art; the  solidity of their buildings and accuracy of their aim was not affected  by it. But sooner or later they were forced to grapple with phenomena,  which the supposed parallelism of all perpendiculars erected from the  earth's surface rendered inexplicable: then also commenced a struggle  between the prejudices, which for centuries had sufficed in daily  practice, and the unprecedented opinions which the testimony of the eyes  seemed to contradict.    Thus, on the one hand, the falsest judgments, whether based on isolated  facts or only on appearances, always embrace some truths whose sphere,  whether large or small, affords room for a certain number of inferences,  beyond which we fall into absurdity. The ideas of St. Augustine, for  example, contained the following truths: that bodies fall towards the  earth, that they fall in a straight line, that either the sun or the  earth moves, that either the sky or the earth turns, &c. These general  facts always have been true; our science has added nothing to them. But,  on the other hand, it being necessary to account for every thing, we are  obliged to seek for principles more and more comprehensive: that is why  we have had to abandon successively, first the opinion that the world  was flat, then the theory which regards it as the stationary centre of  the universe, &c.    If we pass now from physical nature to the moral world, we still find  ourselves subject to the same deceptions of appearance, to the same  influences of spontaneity and habit. But the distinguishing feature of  this second division of our knowledge is, on the one hand, the good  or the evil which we derive from our opinions; and, on the other, the  obstinacy with which we defend the prejudice which is tormenting and  killing us.    Whatever theory we embrace in regard to the shape of the earth and the  cause of its weight, the physics of the globe does not suffer; and,  as for us, our social economy can derive therefrom neither profit nor  damage. But it is in us and through us that the laws of our moral nature  work; now, these laws cannot be executed without our deliberate aid,  and, consequently, unless we know them. If, then, our science of moral  laws is false, it is evident that, while desiring our own good, we are  accomplishing our own evil; if it is only incomplete, it may suffice for  a time for our social progress, but in the long run it will lead us  into a wrong road, and will finally precipitate us into an abyss of  calamities.    Then it is that we need to exercise our highest judgments; and, be it  said to our glory, they are never found wanting: but then also commences  a furious struggle between old prejudices and new ideas. Days of  conflagration and anguish! We are told of the time when, with the same  beliefs, with the same institutions, all the world seemed happy: why  complain of these beliefs; why banish these institutions? We are slow to  admit that that happy age served the precise purpose of developing the  principle of evil which lay dormant in society; we accuse men and gods,  the powers of earth and the forces of Nature. Instead of seeking the  cause of the evil in his mind and heart, man blames his masters, his  rivals, his neighbors, and himself; nations arm themselves, and slay  and exterminate each other, until equilibrium is restored by the vast  depopulation, and peace again arises from the ashes of the combatants.  So loath is humanity to touch the customs of its ancestors, and to  change the laws framed by the founders of communities, and confirmed by  the faithful observance of the ages.    _Nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est_: Distrust all innovations, wrote  Titus Livius. Undoubtedly it would be better were man not compelled to  change: but what! because he is born ignorant, because he exists only  on condition of gradual self-instruction, must he abjure the light,  abdicate his reason, and abandon himself to fortune? Perfect health is  better than convalescence: should the sick man, therefore, refuse to  be cured? Reform, reform! cried, ages since, John the Baptist and Jesus  Christ. Reform, reform! cried our fathers, fifty years ago; and for a  long time to come we shall shout, Reform, reform!    Seeing the misery of my age, I said to myself: Among the principles that  support society, there is one which it does not understand, which its  ignorance has vitiated, and which causes all the evil that exists. This  principle is the most ancient of all; for it is a characteristic of  revolutions to tear down the most modern principles, and to respect  those of long-standing. Now the evil by which we suffer is anterior to  all revolutions. This principle, impaired by our ignorance, is honored  and cherished; for if it were not cherished it would harm nobody, it  would be without influence.    But this principle, right in its purpose, but misunderstood: this  principle, as old as humanity, what is it? Can it be religion?    All men believe in God: this dogma belongs at once to their conscience  and their mind. To humanity God is a fact as primitive, an idea as  inevitable, a principle as necessary as are the categorical ideas of  cause, substance, time, and space to our understanding. God is proven to  us by the conscience prior to any inference of the mind; just as the  sun is proven to us by the testimony of the senses prior to all the  arguments of physics. We discover phenomena and laws by observation and  experience; only this deeper sense reveals to us existence. Humanity  believes that God is; but, in believing in God, what does it believe? In  a word, what is God?    The nature of this notion of Divinity,--this primitive, universal  notion, born in the race,--the human mind has not yet fathomed. At each  step that we take in our investigation of Nature and of causes, the idea  of God is extended and exalted; the farther science advances, the more  God seems to grow and broaden. Anthropomorphism and idolatry constituted  of necessity the faith of the mind in its youth, the theology of infancy  and poesy. A harmless error, if they had not endeavored to make it a  rule of conduct, and if they had been wise enough to respect the"]]]
