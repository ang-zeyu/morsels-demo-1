The acquisition of additional  specimens, especially from the area between Sinaloa and Colima and from  Guerrero, is necessary to determine the relationships among the various  populations known at present. Both species of _Diaglena_ inhabit  tropical scrub forest; none has been found in the more humid and  tropical semi-deciduous forests. Humid forest replaces the scrub forest  in the lowlands of southern Nayarit and northern Jalisco; possibly this  forest acts as a barrier to the distribution of _Diaglena_ and thus  serves as a divider between the ranges of _D. spatulata_ to the north  and _D. reticulata_ to the south.      ~Pternohyla fodiens~ Boulenger         _Pternohyla fodiens_ Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser.       5, 10:326, 1882.--Presidio, Sinaloa, Mexico.         Nueva Italia (2).    These specimens (JRD 5994-5) were found on the road near Nueva Italia  during a heavy rain on the night of August 25, 1960, by James R. Dixon.  Both are females having snout-vent lengths of 64.0 and 59.0 mm. They are  typical of the species as it is known from Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco,  and Colima.    These specimens constitute the southernmost record for the species,  which ranges in semi-arid habitats from southern Arizona southward along  the Pacific lowlands of Mexico to Colima and inland on the Mexican  Plateau in Jalisco.      ~Phyllomedusa dacnicolor~ Cope         _Phyllomedusa dacnicolor_ Cope, Proc.

This large tree frog has been found only in the lowlands below elevation  of about 1000 meters, usually in arid tropical scrub forest. Calling  males were heard on rainy nights throughout the rainy season; in nearly  every instance both males and females were found in low trees and  bushes. On summer nights when there had been no rain, adults were found  sitting on bushes in the scrub forest.    At Coalcoman on July 1, 1955, a chorus was heard at midday. About forty  _Phyllomedusa dacnicolor_ were found in one guayava bush at the edge of  a recently dried pond. Individual males were calling; clasping males  were silent. The call is a barking groan. Fifteen individual egg masses  were hanging from branches and leaves in tear-drop fashion. Each egg  mass contained 100 to 350 pale green eggs, located only in the exterior  part of the clear gelatinous mass. Two composite egg masses appeared to  have been made up by egg deposition on the part of three to five females  (Pl. 2, Fig. 2).    As shown by Duellman (1957a), the characters used by Taylor (1952) to  diagnose _Phyllomedusa alcorni_ are sexually dimorphic. Funkhouser  (1957) apparently was unaware of this sexual dimorphism, for she  recognized _P. alcorni_ and _P. dacnicolor_ as distinct species.      ~Phrynohyas inflata~ (Taylor)         _Acrodytes inflata_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 30:64,       June 12, 1944.--La Venta, Guerrero, Mexico.         _Phrynohyas inflata_, Duellman, Misc. Publ. Mus. Zool. Univ.       Michigan, 96:19, February 1, 1956.         _Phrynohyas corasterias_ Shannon and Humphrey,       Herpetologica, 13:15, March 30, 1957.--4.8 miles east of San       Blas, Nayarit, Mexico.         Barranca de Bejuco.    One specimen of this large species was collected in 1951; it was found  on a low branch in tropical semi-deciduous forest at an elevation of 65  meters. In life there were olive-gray blotches on a pale gray dorsum;  the iris was a dark golden color.    This species, which is known from only a few specimens, seems to be  restricted to the coastal lowlands and low foothills from Guerrero  northward to Nayarit. Shannon and Humphrey (1957) described _Phrynohyas  corasterias_ from Nayarit. Their description was based on a small female  having a snout-vent length of 34.4 mm. The new species was diagnosed as  differing from _P. inflata_ in having less webbing on the feet, a poorly  developed supratympanic fold, a more pustulate dorsum, and marked  differences in dorsal pattern, color, and nature of antebrachial  banding. The significance of the webbing was questioned by Shannon and  Humphrey. The nature of the supratympanic fold and dorsal pustules  changes with age (Duellman, 1956a:31). _Phrynohyas inflata_ is known to  attain a snout-vent length of 95 mm. Dermal structures that undergo  ontogenetic change are of little importance in comparing a juvenile with  a large adult. The only significant difference in color pattern between  _P. inflata_ and _P. corasterias_ is the presence of wide transverse  bands on the limbs of the latter. In this respect _P. corasterias_  approaches _P. latifasciata_, a species known only from two specimens  from southern Sinaloa. The acquisition of additional specimens from  Jalisco, Nayarit, and Sinaloa may show that _P. inflata_ and _P.  latifasciata_ are conspecific, as suggested by Duellman (1956a:21).  Nonetheless, the specimen on which the description of _P. corasterias_  was based is not sufficiently different from the known specimens of _P.  inflata_ to warrant specific recognition.      ~Hyla arenicolor~         _Hyla arenicolor_ Cope, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       ser. 2, 6:84, July, 1866.--Northern Sonora, Mexico. Type       locality restricted to Santa Rita Mountains, Pima County,       Arizona, by Smith and Taylor (1950a:354).         Agua Cerca; Cascada Tzararacua (3); Chinapa; Cojumatlan; Dos       Aguas; El Sabino (25); El Espinal; Lago de Camecuaro;       Lombardia (2); Tupataro; Zinapecuaro.    Altitudinally this frog ranges from 500 to 2100 meters; although the  environments in which it has been found vary from open arid tropical  scrub forest to pine forest, it usually is found near rocky streams in  these habitats. There is great disparity in size between specimens from  the mountains and those from the Tepalcatepec Valley. Seven males from  elevations in excess of 1400 meters have an average snout-vent length of  34.7 mm.; nine from elevations below 1000 meters have an average  snout-vent length of 49.1 mm. In life a male collected at night at  Lombardia (UMMZ 112846) had dark brown spots on a grayish brown dorsum;  the groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, and ventral  surfaces of the hind limbs and palms were yellowish orange. The belly  and tips of digits were white; the vocal sac was purplish brown, and the  iris was dark grayish gold. In contrast, a specimen obtained in the  daytime at Chinapa (UMMZ 119204) had indistinct gray spots on a pale  ashy gray dorsum; the flash colors were yellow. After dark the spots  were dark olive-brown on a grayish brown dorsum.    Two males were found calling from a rocky stream near Lombardia on July  12, 1955. The call is a nasal \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"      ~Hyla baudini~ Dumeril and Bibron         _Hyla baudinii_ Dumeril and Bibron, Erpetologie generale,       vol. 8:564, 1841.--Mexico.

However, I  own that it was lucky I was on the spot.\"    \"But it was not a question of luck at all,\" Mr. Renshaw insisted. \"You  were there because you had specially gone ashore to look after these  foolish young fellows, and your being there was the result of your own  thoughtfulness for them, and not in any way of chance.\"    \"There is quite a crowd on the quay, Mr. Renshaw,\" the captain said when  that gentleman went on deck, \"I suppose they have found stains of blood  in the road and conclude that a crime has been committed. Oh, here is  our boat putting out from the landing-place. The steward has been on  shore to get fresh fruit for breakfast; he will tell us what is going  on.\"    The steward had gone ashore before the news of the encounter had been  spread by the surgeon.    \"What is the excitement about on shore?\" the captain asked him as he  stepped on deck.    \"Well, sir, as far as I could learn from a chap who spoke a little  English, there have been bad doings on shore in the night. Two men were  found this morning lying dead there. There is nothing uncommon about  that; but they say there are no wounds on them, except that their skulls  are stove in, as if they had both been struck by a beam of wood at the  back of the head. But besides that there were two or three pools of  blood in the road. It seems one man walked back into the town, for there  are marks of his feet as if he stepped in the blood before starting in  that direction. Then there is a line of blood spots down to the  landing-place and down the steps, as if somebody had got into a boat.  Nobody seems to make head nor tail of the business.\"    \"Well, we must keep this quiet if we can,\" the captain said, turning to  Mr. Renshaw. \"If it were known that any of our people were concerned in  this affair they might keep us here for three weeks or a month while it  is being investigated, or insist upon Mr. Atherton and your son and the  Allens remaining behind as witnesses. Mr. Ryan,\" he called to the  first-mate, \"just come here a moment. This matter is more serious than  we thought. It seems that Mr. Atherton, who, as we have heard, dashed  the heads of two of these fellows together, killed them on the spot.\"    \"Sure and I thought as much when young Allen was telling me about it,\"  the mate said. \"I have seen Mr. Atherton at work before this, and I  thought to myself that unless those fellows' skulls were made of iron,  and thick at that, they must have gone in when he brought them  together.\"    \"The worst of it is,\" the captain went on, \"they have traced marks of  blood down to the landing-stage, and of course have suspicion that  someone concerned in the affair took a boat, and either came off to one  of the ships or went away in one of the fishing craft. You know what  these fellows are; if they find out that anyone on board is mixed up in  the matter, they will keep the ship here for a month.\"    \"That is true enough, sir. It is mighty lucky we would be if we got away  in a month.\"    \"The first thing is to see about the boatmen,\" the captain said. \"Of  course if they tell the authorities they brought a wounded man on board  here late last night there is an end of it; but if they hold their  tongues, and we all keep our own council, the thing may not leak out  to-day, and we will have our anchor up and get out this evening if we  can. You had better tell all the crew that not a word is to be said  about the matter, and I will impress the same on the passengers. When  they know that a careless word may lead to a month's detention, you may  be sure there will be no talking. But before you speak to them I will go  down and see Mr. Atherton, and hear what he says about the boatmen.\" He  returned in two or three minutes. \"I hope it will be all right,\" he  said. \"Atherton gave them a pound apiece, and told them to hold their  tongues. He thinks it is probable they will do so, for they would know  well enough that they would, as likely as not, be clapped into prison  and kept there while the investigation was going on. So there is a  strong hope that it may not leak out through them. You must stop all  leave ashore, Mr. Ryan. Tell the men whose turn it is to go, they shall  have their spree at Buenos Ayres. If they were to get drunk it would be  as likely as not to slip out.\"    \"I will see to it, sir.\"    Directly breakfast was over the captain took a boat and went ashore. He  had duly impressed upon all the passengers the absolute necessity for  silence, and several of these went ashore with him. He returned half an  hour later, having been up to the British Consulate.    \"The affair is making quite a stir in the town. Not on account of two  men being found dead, there is nothing uncommon in that, especially as  they have been recognized as two notorious ruffians; but the whole  circumstances of the affair puzzle them.    \"The doctors who have examined the bodies have arrived pretty well at  the truth, and say that both men have been gripped by the throat, for  the marks of the fingers are plainly visible, and their heads dashed  together. But although this is, as we know, perfectly true, no one  believes it; for the doctors themselves admit that it does not appear to  them possible that any man would have had the strength requisite to  completely batter in the skulls of two others, as has been done in this  case. The police are searching the town for the man whose footsteps led  in that direction, and as they know all the haunts of these ruffians and  their associates it is likely enough that they will find him, especially  as his face is sure to bear marks of Atherton's handiwork. Still, if  they do find him, and he tells all he knows of the business, they will  not be much nearer to tracing the actors in it to this ship. It is not  probable that he recovered his senses until long after they were on  board the boat, and can only say that while engaged in attempting to rob  some passers-by he was suddenly knocked down. But even this they are not  likely to get out of him first, for he will know that he used a knife,  and is not likely to put himself in the way of punishment if he can help  it. I came off at once, because I heard at the Consulate that the police  are going to search every ship in the harbour to see if they can find  some wounded man, or get some clue to the mystery, so I must ask the  doctor if his two patients are fit to be dressed and go up on deck.\"    The doctor on being consulted said that he should certainly have  preferred that they should have remained quiet all day, but he did not  know that it would do them any harm to get on deck for a bit. And  accordingly in half an hour Mr. Atherton and James Allen came up. The  doctor, who had assisted them to dress, accompanied them.    \"Now, Mr. Atherton, you had better seat yourself in that great  deck-chair of yours with the leg-rest. If you sit there quietly reading  when they come on board they are not likely to suspect you of being a  desperate character, or to appreciate your inches and width of shoulder.  Allen had better sit quiet till they get alongside, and then slip that  sling into his pocket and walk up and down talking to one of the ladies,  with his thumb in his waistcoat so as to support his arm. He looks pale  and shaky; but they are not accustomed to much colour here, and he will  pass well enough.\"    As soon as Mr. Atherton had taken his seat Mrs. Renshaw and Marion came  up to him. \"How can we thank you enough, Mr. Atherton, for the risks you  have run to succour Wilfrid, and for your kind consideration in going on  shore to wait for him?\"    \"It was nothing, Mrs. Renshaw. I own to enjoying a scrimmage when I can  go into one with the feeling of being in the right. You know that I am a  very lazy man, but it is just your lazy men who do enjoy exerting  themselves occasionally.\"    \"It was grand!\" Marion broke in; \"and you ought not to talk as if it was  nothing, Mr. Atherton. Wilfrid said that he thought it was all over with  him till he saw a big man flying down the road.\"    \"A perfect colossus of Rhodes!\" Mr. Atherton laughed.    \"It is not a thing to joke about,\" Marion went on earnestly. \"It may  seem very little to you, Mr. Atherton, but it is everything to us.\"    \"Don't you know that one always jokes when one is serious, Miss Renshaw?  You know that in church any little thing that you would scarcely notice  at any other time makes you inclined to laugh. Some day in the far  distance, when you become a woman, you will know the truth of the  saying, that smiles and tears are very close to each other.\"    \"I am getting to be a woman now,\" Marion said with some dignity; for Mr.  Atherton always persisted in treating her as if she were a child, which,  as she was nearly seventeen, was a standing grievance to her.    \"Age does not make a woman, Miss Renshaw. I saw you skipping three days  ago with little Kate Mitford and your brother and young Allen, and you  enjoyed it as much as any of them.\"    \"We were trying which could keep up the longest,\" Marion said; \"Wilfrid  and I against the other two. You were looking on, and I believe you  would have liked to have skipped too.\"    \"I think I should,\" Mr. Atherton agreed. \"You young people do not skip  half as well as we used to when I was a boy; and I should have given you  a lesson if I had not been afraid of shaking the ship's timbers to  pieces.\"    \"How absurd you are, Mr. Atherton!\" Marion said pettishly. \"Of course  you are not thin, but you always talk of yourself as if you were  something monstrous.\"    Mr. Atherton laughed. His diversion had had the desired effect, and had  led them away from the subject of the fight on shore.    \"There is a galley putting off from shore with a lot of officials on  board,\" the captain said, coming up at this moment. \"They are rowing to  the next ship, and I suppose they will visit us next.\"    A quarter of an hour later the galley came alongside,"]]]
