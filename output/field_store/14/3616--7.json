[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#11)"],[1,"be heard by man: the music of  another world! the unearthly, dear melody of the Shi'! So sweet it was  that the sense strained to it, and having reached must follow drowsily  in its wake, and would merge in it, and could not return again to its  own place until that strange harmony was finished and the ear restored  to freedom.    But Fionn had taken the covering from his spear, and with his brow  pressed close to it he kept his mind and all his senses engaged on that  sizzling, murderous point.    The music ceased and Aillen hissed a fierce blue flame from his mouth,  and it was as though he hissed lightning.    Here it would seem that Fionn used magic, for spreading out his fringed  mantle he caught the flame. Rather he stopped it, for it slid from the  mantle and sped down into the earth to the depth of twenty-six spans;  from which that slope is still called the Glen of the Mantle, and the  rise on which Aillen stood is known as the Ard of Fire.    One can imagine the surprise of Aillen mac Midna, seeing his fire caught  and quenched by an invisible hand. And one can imagine that at this  check he might be frightened, for who would be more terrified than a  magician who sees his magic fail, and who, knowing of power, will guess  at powers of which he has no conception and may well dread.    Everything had been done by him as it should be done. His pipe had been  played and his timpan, all who heard that music should be asleep, and  yet his fire was caught in full course and was quenched.    Aillen, with all the terrific strength of which he was master, blew  again, and the great jet of blue flame came roaring and whistling from  him and was caught and disappeared.    Panic swirled into the man from Faery; he turned from that terrible spot  and fled, not knowing what might be behind, but dreading it as he  had never before dreaded anything, and the unknown pursued him; that  terrible defence became offence and hung to his heel as a wolf pads by  the flank of a bull.    And Aillen was not in his own world! He was in the world of men, where  movement is not easy and the very air a burden. In his own sphere, in  his own element, he might have outrun Fionn, but this was Fionn's world,  Fionn's element, and the flying god was not gross enough to outstrip  him. Yet what a race he gave, for it was but at the entrance to his  own Shi' that the pursuer got close enough. Fionn put a finger into  the thong of the great spear, and at that cast night fell on Aillen  mac Midna. His eyes went black, his mind whirled and ceased, there  came nothingness where he had been, and as the Birgha whistled into his  shoulder-blades he withered away, he tumbled emptily and was dead. Fionn  took his lovely head from its shoulders and went back through the night  to Tara.    Triumphant Fionn, who had dealt death to a god, and to whom death would  be dealt, and who is now dead!    He reached the palace at sunrise.    On that morning all were astir early. They wished to see what  destruction had been wrought by the great being, but it was young Fionn  they saw and that redoubtable head swinging by its hair. \"What is your  demand?\" said the Ard-Ri'. \"The thing that it is right I should ask,\"  said Fionn: \"the command of the Fianna of Ireland.\"    \"Make your choice,\" said Conn to Goll Mor; \"you will leave Ireland, or  you will place your hand in the hand of this champion and be his man.\"    Goll could do a thing that would be hard for another person, and he  could do it so beautifully that he was not diminished by any action.    \"Here is my hand,\" said Goll.    And he twinkled at the stern, young eyes that gazed on him as he made  his submission.          THE BIRTH OF BRAN        CHAPTER I    There are people who do not like dogs a bit--they are usually women--but  in this story there is a man who did not like dogs. In fact, he hated  them. When he saw one he used to go black in the face, and he threw  rocks at it until it got out of sight. But the Power that protects all  creatures had put a squint into this man's eye, so that he always threw  crooked.    This gentleman's name was Fergus Fionnliath, and his stronghold was near  the harbour of Galway. Whenever a dog barked he would leap out of his  seat, and he would throw everything that he owned out of the window in  the direction of the bark. He gave prizes to servants who disliked dogs,  and when he heard that a man had drowned a litter of pups he used to  visit that person and try to marry his daughter.    Now Fionn, the son of Uail, was the reverse of Fergus Fionnliath in this  matter, for he delighted in dogs, and he knew everything about them from  the setting of the first little white tooth to the rocking of the last  long yellow one. He knew the affections and antipathies which are proper  in a dog; the degree of obedience to which dogs may be trained without  losing their honourable qualities or becoming servile and suspicious;  he knew the hopes that animate them, the apprehensions which tingle in  their blood, and all that is to be demanded from, or forgiven in, a  paw, an ear, a nose, an eye, or a tooth; and he understood these things  because he loved dogs, for it is by love alone that we understand  anything.    Among the three hundred dogs which Fionn owned there were two to whom  he gave an especial tenderness, and who were his daily and nightly  companions. These two were Bran and Sceo'lan, but if a person were to  guess for twenty years he would not find out why Fionn loved these two  dogs and why he would never be separated from them.    Fionn's mother, Muirne, went to wide Allen of Leinster to visit her son,  and she brought her young sister Tuiren with her. The mother and aunt  of the great captain were well treated among the Fianna, first, because  they were parents to Fionn, and second, because they were beautiful and  noble women.    No words can describe how delightful Muirne was--she took the branch;  and as to Tuiren, a man could not look at her without becoming angry  or dejected. Her face was fresh as a spring morning; her voice more  cheerful than the cuckoo calling from the branch that is highest in the  hedge; and her form swayed like a reed and flowed like a river, so that  each person thought she would surely flow to him.    Men who had wives of their own grew moody and downcast because they  could not hope to marry her, while the bachelors of the Fianna stared at  each other with truculent, bloodshot eyes, and then they gazed on Tuiren  so gently that she may have imagined she was being beamed on by the mild  eyes of the dawn.    It was to an Ulster gentleman, Iollan Eachtach, that she gave her love,  and this chief stated his rights and qualities and asked for her in  marriage.    Now Fionn did not dislike the man of Ulster, but either he did not  know them well or else he knew them too well, for he made a curious  stipulation before consenting to the marriage. He bound Iollan to return  the lady if there should be occasion to think her unhappy, and Iollan  agreed to do so. The sureties to this bargain were Caelte mac Ronan,  Goll mac Morna, and Lugaidh. Lugaidh himself gave the bride away, but  it was not a pleasant ceremony for him, because he also was in love with  the lady, and he would have preferred keeping her to giving her away.  When she had gone he made a poem about her, beginning:           \"There is no more light in the sky--\"    And hundreds of sad people learned the poem by heart.        CHAPTER II    When Iollan and Tuiren were married they went to Ulster, and they lived  together very happily. But the law of life is change; nothing  continues in the same way for any length of time; happiness must become  unhappiness, and will be succeeded again by the joy it had displaced.  The past also must be reckoned with; it is seldom as far behind us as we  could wish: it is more often in front, blocking the way, and the future  trips over it just when we think that the road is clear and joy our own.    Iollan had a past. He was not ashamed of it; he merely thought it  was finished, although in truth it was only beginning, for it is that  perpetual beginning of the past that we call the future.    Before he joined the Fianna he had been in love with a lady of the Shi',  named Uct Dealv (Fair Breast), and they had been sweethearts for years.  How often he had visited his sweetheart in Faery! With what eagerness  and anticipation he had gone there; the lover's whistle that he used to  give was known to every person in that Shi', and he had been discussed  by more than one of the delicate sweet ladies of Faery. \"That is your  whistle, Fair Breast,\" her sister of the Shi' would say.    And Uct Dealv would reply: \"Yes, that is my mortal, my lover, my pulse,  and my one treasure.\"    She laid her spinning aside, or her embroidery if she was at that, or if  she were baking a cake of fine wheaten bread mixed with honey she would  leave the cake to bake itself and fly to Iollan. Then they went hand in  hand in the country that smells of apple-blossom and honey, looking on  heavy-boughed trees and on dancing and beaming clouds. Or they stood  dreaming together, locked in a clasping of arms and eyes, gazing up  and down on each other, Iollan staring down into sweet grey wells that  peeped and flickered under thin brows, and Uct Dealv looking up into  great black ones that went dreamy and went hot in endless alternation.    Then Iollan would go back to the world of men, and Uct Dealv would  return to her occupations in the Land of the Ever Young.    \"What did he say?\" her sister of the Shi' would ask.    \"He said I was the Berry of the Mountain, the Star of Knowledge, and the  Blossom of the Raspberry.\"    \"They always say the same thing,\" her sister pouted.    \"But they look other things,\" Uct Dealv insisted. \"They feel other  things,\" she murmured; and an endless conversation recommenced.    Then for some time Iollan did not come to Faery, and Uct"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28957"],[0,"The Acts of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland (#11)"],[1,"in the  books of the Assembly, with a letter to be directed from his Majestie to  the noble-men and gentle-men of the Countrey, for the erection of  Presbyteries, consisting of Pastours, and Elders, and dissolution of  Prelacies, and with an offer to set forward the Policie untill it were  established by Parliament. The Kings letter subscribed by his hand, to the  Noble-men, and Gentle-men, was read in open audience of the whole  Assembly.    This Assembly ordained the book of Policie to be insert in the register by  the act following.          _For as much as travels have been taken in the framing of the      Policie of the Kirk, and diverse suits have been made to the      Magistrat for approbation thereof, which yet have not taken the      happie effect, which good men would wish, yet that the posteritie      may judge well of the present age; and of the meaning of the Kirk;      The Assembly hath concluded, that the book of Policie agreed to in      diverse Assemblies before, should be registrat in the acts of the      Kirk, and remaine therein_ ad perpetuam rei memoriam: _and the      coppies thereof to be taken to every Presbyterie: of which book      the tennour followeth, &c._      Immediatly after the inserting of the book of Policie, called there the  book of Discipline, the Assembly ordained that the confession of Faith be  subscribed as followeth.          _Anent the confession of Faith lately set forth by the Kings      Majestie, and subscribed by his highnesse. The Assembly in one      voice, acknowledgeth the said Confession to be a true, Christian,      and faithful confession, to be eagreed unto by such as truly      professe Christ, and have a care of Religion, and the tennour      thereof to be followed out efoldly as the samine is laid out in      the said Proclamation_, wherein that Discipline is sworn to.      In the general Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_ in _October_ 1581. Sess. 10.  Mr. _Robert Montgomery_ is accused for teaching that Discipline is a thing  indifferent. Sess. 23. The Assembly gave commission to the Presbyterie of  _Stirling_, to charge Mr. _Robert Montgomerie_, to continue in the  ministerie of _Stirling_, and not to medle with any other office or  function of the Kirk, namely in aspyring to the Bishoprick of _Glasgow_,  against the word of God, and acts of the Kirk, under the pain of  excommunication.    In the same Assembly it is acknowledged that the estate of Bishops is  condemned by the Kirk, a commission for erection of moe Presbyteries was  renewed: and a new ordinance made for subscribing the confession of Faith,  and to proceed against whatsoever persons that would not acknowledge and  subscribe the same.    In the Assembly holden in _April_ 1582. there was a new commission for  erection of Presbyteries, where none was as yet erected, Mr. _Robert  Montgomerie_, pretending to be Bishop of _Glasgow_, was ordained to be  deposed and excommunicat, except hee gave evident tokens of repentance,  and promise to superseed, which he did not: and therefore he was  excommunicat shortly after, according to the ordinance of this Assembly.    In the generall Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_, 1582. The generall  Assembly gave commission to some Presbyteries, to try and censure such as  were called Bishops, for the great slander arising by their impunitie.  Commission was given at this Assembly to present some articles to the  Councel and Estates, for approving and establishing by their authoritie  the Presbyteries, the Synodall, and generall Assemblies. In the 19. Sess.  The Assembly declared, that no Bishop may sit upon the Councell in name of  the Kirk.    In the Assembly holden _Anno_ 1586. These two articles were agreed upon.  First _It is found that all such as the Scripture appointeth governours of  the Kirk, to wit Pastours, Doctours, and Elders, may conveen to the  generall Assemblies, and vote in Ecclesiasticall matters._ Secondly:  _There are foure office bearers set down to us by the Scriptures, to wit  Pastours, Doctours, Elders, and Deacons, and the name of Bishop ought not  to be taken as it hath been in time of Papistrie, but is common to all  Pastours, and Ministers._    In the Assembly holden _Anno_ 1587. Sess. 8. It was ordained that the  admission of Mr. _Robert Montgomerie_ by the Presbyterie of _Glasgow_,  suppose to the temporalitie of the Bishoprick only, be undone and annulled  with all possible diligence, to the effect slander might be removed from  the Kirk. In Sess. 15. Mr. _Robert Pont_ shewed the Kings presentation to  the Bishoprick of _Cathnes_, & desidered the judgement of the Assembly.  The Assembly in their letter to the Kings Majestie, declared that they  judged the said _Mr. Robert_ to be a Bishop already according to the  Doctrine of St. _Paul_: But as to that corrupt estate or office, of these  who have been termed Bishops heretofore, they found it not agreable to the  word of God, and that it hath been damned in diverse Assemblies before.    In the instructions given to such as were appointed to wait upon the  Parliament, it was ordained in the same Assembly Sess. 17. That they be  careful that nothing be admitted prejudicial to the liberties of this  Kirk, as it was concluded according to the word of God in the general  Assemblies, preceeding the year 1584. but precisely to seek the same to be  ratified in the Assembly holden in _March_ 1589. where the articles were  made for subscribing the confession of Faith with the generall band, it  was ordained as followeth.          _For so much as the neighbour Kirk in_ England, _is understood to      bee heavily troubled, for maintaining of the true Discipline and      government: whose grieves ought to move us. Therefore the      Presbytery of_ Edinburgh _was ordained to comfort the said Kirk in      the said matter._      In the Assembly holden 1590. when the confession of Faith was subscribed  universally _de novo_, a ratification of the liberties of the Kirk, in her  jurisdiction, discipline, Presbyteries, Synods, and generall Assemblies,  and an abrogation of all things contrarie thereunto; was ordained to be  sought both of the Councel and Parliament. In the next Session it was  ordained that the book of Discipline, specially the controverted heads,  should be subscribed by all Ministers that bear, or hereafter was to bear  office in this Kirk, and that they be charged by the Presbyteries, under  the pain of excommunication: Seeing the word of God cannot bee keeped in  sincerity, unlesse the holy Discipline be preserved. The Presbyteries were  ordained to get a coppie under the Clerks hand; there were sundrie coppies  subscribed by the Ministers in the Presbyteries yet extant, as  _Hadingtoun_, _Dumfermling_, &c. produced before the Assembly.    In the Assembly 1591. Sess. 4. The former act anent the subscription to  the book of _Policie_ is renewed, and a penaltie imposed upon the  Moderatour, in case it be not put in execution.    In the Assembly _22. May 1592._ Sess. 2. These articles were drawn up.  _That the acts of Parliament made 1584. against the Discipline, libertie  and authoritie of the Kirk be annulled, and the samine discipline, whereof  the Kirk hath been in practise, precisely ratified. That Abbots, Priors,  and other Prelats pretending the title of the Kirk, be not suffered in  time coming._ In the 11. Session the number of the Presbyteries were given  up, and insert in the Parliament immediatly following. The fifth of _June_  1592. The libertie, discipline, and jurisdiction of the true Kirk, in her  Sessions, Presbyteries, Synodal and general Assemblies, is largely  ratified, as the samine was used, and exercised within this Realme, and  all the acts contrary thereto abrogat: The Kings prerogative declared not  to be prejudicial to the same priviledges grounded upon the word of God,  the former commissions to Bishops 1584. rescinded, and all Ecclesiastical  matters, subjected to Presbyteries, according to the discipline of this  Kirk. _Anno_ 1595. The book of Policie with other acts is ratified and  ordained to be printed.    It was also cleared that Episcopacie was condemned in these words of the  Confession, HIS WICKED HEIRARCHIE. For the Popish _Hierarchie_ doth  consist of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, that is baptizing and  preaching Deacons: For so it is determined in the councel of _Trent_, in  the 4. chap. _De Sacramento ordinis, can. 6_.    (M1) _Si quis dixerit in ecclesia Catholica non esse heirarchiam divina  ordinatione institutam, quae constat ex Episcopis. Presbyteris & ministris,  anathema sit._ _Bellarmine_ likewise in his book _De Clericis._ _cap._ 11.  saith, _That there are three Hierarchies in the militant Kirk: The first  of Bishops, the second of Priests, the third of Deacons, and that the  Deacons are also Princes, if they be compared with the people:_ This  proposition following; _Hierarchia ecclesiastica constat ex Pontifice,  Cardinalibus, Archiepiscopis, Episcopis & Regularibus_, was censured by  the Facultie of Theologie in the Universitie at _Paris_, as followeth,  _Inicta prima propositione enumeratio membrorum hierarchiae ecclesiasticae  sen sacri principatus, divina ordinatione instituti est manca & redundaus  atque, inducens in errorem contrarium determinationi sacrae Sinodi  Tridentinae_: The proposition was defective, because it pretermitted the  Presbyters and Deacons; it was censured as redundant, because it made the  _Hierarchie_ to consist of the _Pope_, _Cardinals_, _Archbishops_, and  _Regulars_; the _Pope_ is not within the _Hierarchie of Primats_,  _Metropolitanes_, and _Archbishops_, but as they are Bishops. Furthermore,  this _Hierarchie_ is distinguished in the confession from the _Popes  monarchie_. And howbeit this _Hierarchie_ be called the _Antichrists  Hierarchie_, yet it is not to distinguish betwixt the _Hierarchie_ in the  Popish Kirk, and any other as lawful: But the _Hierarchie_, wheresoever it  is, is"]]]
