One of the simplest kinds consists  of two thin strips of pine board, a foot or more long, nailed to end  pieces with a space between the two boards wide enough to accommodate  the bodies of the butterflies. Beneath this open space, a piece of  thin cork is tacked. The pin on which the butterfly is fastened is  pushed through the cork until the wings of the insect are level with  the boards. The wings are then brought forward with a needle point  until they are in the desired position and they are then held in place  by pieces of glass or by bits of cardboard fastened down by pins. The  butterflies must be left in this position until thoroughly dry.       [Illustration: Drying Box for Setting Boards. (After Riley)]    Special insect pins should be used for butterflies. These are longer  than common pins and have rounded heads. They are offered for sale by  entomological dealers. Instead of pinning the insects and preserving  them in cabinets, one may keep them in the Riker mounts, which have  the advantage of being sealed so that there is no chance for dust or  museum pests to reach the specimens. If one wishes to collect  extensively, one will need a considerable number of setting boards and  it will be worth while to prepare for them a special drying box like  that shown in the picture above.          PART II    THE TRUE BUTTERFLIES      SUPERFAMILY _Papilionoidea_    The great suborder of butterflies is commonly separated into two  principal groups called superfamilies. One of these includes all of  the higher butterflies and is named _Papilionoidea_. The other  includes the lower Skipper butterflies and is named the  _Hesperioidea_. The former are characterized by small bodies and  relatively large wings, straight clubbed antennae, and the fact that  the caterpillars do not make cocoons when preparing for the chrysalis  state.    The most authoritative classifications of butterfly families are based  upon the peculiarities of wing venation and are admirably discussed in  such books as Holland's \"Butterfly Book\" and Comstock's \"How to Know  the Butterflies.\" Without attempting to go into the technical details  of structure it will suffice here to give the list of families which  compose the superfamily _Papilionoidea_:        The Parnassians. _Parnassiidae._      The Swallowtails. _Papilionidae._      The Whites, Orange-tips, and Yellows. _Pieridae._      The Nymphs. _Nymphalidae._      The Satyrs or Meadow-browns. _Agapetidae._      The Heliconians. _Heliconidae._      The Milkweed Butterflies. _Lymnadidae._      The Long-beaks. _Libytheidae._      The Metal-marks. _Riodinidae._      The Gossamer-wings. _Lycaenidae._    It must not be thought that such a list necessarily indicates the  degrees of development of the respective families, for this is not  true. It is simply a linear arrangement adopted for convenience by  leading authorities, notably Dr. Harrison G. Dyar in his standard  \"Catalog of American Lepidoptera.\"          THE PARNASSIAN BUTTERFLIES    FAMILY _Parnassiidae_      It is perhaps a bit unfortunate that the group of butterflies, which  is commonly chosen to head the list of families, is one that is rarely  seen by most collectors. The Parnassians are butterflies of the far  north or of high elevations in the mountains. The four species  credited to North America have been collected in Alaska and the higher  elevations of the Rocky Mountains, so there is very little probability  of any of them being found in the Eastern states.    While, structurally, these butterflies have a close affinity with the  Swallowtails, one would never suspect it from their general  appearance. Their bodies are large and all of the wings well rounded,  so that there is more of the suggestion of a large moth than of the  Swallowtail. The coloring is also more moth-like than with most  butterflies, the wings being very light colored and nearly  transparent, with markings of gray and brown, arranged in dots and  splashes.    All our species belong to the genus Parnassius. The caterpillars show  their affinity with those of the Swallowtails by having the curious  scent organs or osmateria just back of the head. They feed upon such  alpine plants as stonecrop and saxifrage and are well adapted by their  structure and habits to the bleak surroundings of the mountain tops.    As a typical example of the environment in which these butterflies  live, we may take the alpine valleys of such mountain regions as  Pike's Peak. Prof. M. J. Elrod has described a visit where, at an  altitude of 11,500 feet in the month of August, _Parnassius smintheus_  was flying by thousands, and the earlier stages were so abundant that  a water ditch had the surface covered as far as one could see with the  dead or dying caterpillars. In such situations, where ice forms at  night, and snow frequently falls by day, these butterflies develop  apparently in greater numbers than almost any of our other species are  known to do in warmer regions.          THE SWALLOWTAILS    FAMILY _Papilionidae_      This is probably the most distinctive family of all our familiar  butterflies. Its members are characterized by being on the whole the  largest butterflies in our region and by having the hind wings  prolonged into curious tail-like projections, suggestive of those of a  swallow. In general, the basal color of the wings is blackish though  this is commonly marked in various striking ways with yellow, green,  or blue, while the margins of the wings are commonly adorned with red  or orange spots. These butterflies are also characterized by certain  peculiarities in the branching of the wing veins which will be found  pictured in more technical works.    The caterpillars of these butterflies have the characteristic form  pictured on the plate of the Swallowtails opposite page _80_. When  full grown they are large, fairly smooth-bodied worms, showing at most  on the surface sparse fine hairs or fleshy threadlike projections.  Their most characteristic feature is found in the scent organs called  _osmateria_ situated in the back just behind the head. These are  thrust out, generally, when the caterpillar is disturbed and appear as  orange Y- or V-shaped organs from which an offensive odor is commonly  given off. They are supposed to serve the purpose of preventing injury  by enemies, possibly birds, monkeys, and other vertebrates.  Structurally, they are like long tubular pockets that can be turned  inside out. When the pocket is in place it is getting a pocketful of  odors. When it is inverted it lets these odors free. On this account  Professor Comstock has aptly called these caterpillars \"the polecats  of the insect world.\"    When ready to pupate, these Papilio caterpillars spin a web of silk  upon some more or less flattened surface and a loop of silk near by.  They entangle their hind legs in the former and keep their heads  through the latter so the loop supports the body a little behind the  head. Then they change to chrysalids which are held in place by these  sets of silken threads.    The chrysalids are rather large and angular and generally take on  colors approximating their surroundings. They vary so much in  different species that one familiar with them can recognize the  chrysalis and know the kind of butterfly it will produce.       =The Black Swallowtail=    _Papilio polyxenes_    While the Black Swallowtail is not so large as some other members of  the group, it is probably the best known to most people. It is found  throughout many months of the year in practically all parts of North  America south of Canada, and has the habit of flying freely about  fields and gardens in search of flowers from which to suck its nectar  food, and of plants on which to deposit its eggs. The female  butterflies have a remarkable ability in selecting only members of the  great family Umbelliferae for this purpose. In consequence the  caterpillars are generally to be found feeding upon carrots, parsnips,  parsley, and various wild species belonging to this order. (_See  plates, pages 48 and 64-65._)    The eggs of the Black Swallowtail are laid one in a place upon the  leaves of the food plant. Each egg is a small, yellowish, smooth, and  ovoid object. It may often be found by watching the butterflies as  they fly low in search of umbelliferous plants, and seeing one stop  for a minute or so while she lays the egg.    About ten days after the egg is laid it hatches into a small black  caterpillar marked in a characteristic fashion with a blotch of white  in the middle of the body which is suggestive of a saddle. The  caterpillar immediately begins to feed upon the green substance of the  leaf, continuing thus about a week before the first moult. At this  time it does not change much in appearance, still being a spiny  creature blackish in color and marked by the curious white saddle. A  little later it moults again, retaining its original coloring. At each  moult, of course, it gets larger and feeds more freely upon the celery  or other plant on which it may happen to be.    When the caterpillar becomes about half grown it takes on a very  different appearance from that of its early life. The skin is smooth  rather than spiny, and the general colors are green, black, and  yellow. The ground color of the skin is green, which is marked with  black cross-bands along the middle of each body ring. On these bands  there are many large dots of orange yellow, the whole coloring giving  the insect a very striking appearance, especially when it is placed by  itself against a plain background. When they finally become full grown  in this larva state, these caterpillars are almost two inches long.    The larvae of the Black Swallowtail have certain characteristics in  which they differ from many other caterpillars. After each moult they  do not devour their cast skins, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#11)"],[1,"u(NO3)2 were mixed, and HCl added, it is  evident that the silver would be precipitated as chloride of  silver, while the copper would remain in solution. If now this be  filtered, the silver will remain on the filter paper, while in  the filtrate will be the copper. Thus we shall have performed an  analysis, or separated one metal from another. Perform it. Note,  however, that any soluble chloride, as NaCl, would produce the  same result as HCl.    BROMHYDRIC AND IODIHYDRIC ACIDS.    82. NaCl, being the most abundant compound of Cl, is the source  of commercial HCl. KCl treated in the same way would give a like  product. Theoretically HBr and HI might be made in the same way  from NaBr and NaI, but the affinity of H for Br and I is weak,  and the acids separate into their elements, when thus prepared.    83. To make HI.    Experiment 50.--Drop into a t.t. three or four crystals of I, and  add 10 cc. H2O. Hold in the water the end of a d.t. from which  H2S gas is escaping. Observe any deposit, and write the reaction.    FLUORHYDRIC ACID.    84. Preparation and Action.    Experiment 51.--Put 3 or 4 g. powdered CaF2, i.e. fluor spar or  fluorite, into a shallow lead tray, e.g. 4x5 cm, and pour over it  4 or 5 cc. H2SO4. A piece of glass large enough to cover this  should previously be warmed and covered on one side with a very  thin coat of beeswax. To distribute itevenly, warm the other side  of the glass over a flame. When cool, scratch a design (Fig. 24)  through the wax with a sharp metallic point. Lay the glass, film  side down, over the lead tray. Warm this five minutes or more by  placing it high over a small flame (Fig. 25) to avoid melting the  wax. Do not inhale the fumes. Take away the lamp, and leave the  tray and glass where it is not cold, for half an hour or more.  Then remove the wax and clean the glass with naphtha or benzine.  Look for the etching.    Two things should have occurred: (1) the generation of HF. Write  the equation for it. (2) Its etching action on glass. In this  last process HF acts on SiO2 of the glass, forming H2O and SiF4.  Why cannot HF be kept in glass bottles?    A dilute solution of HF, which is a gas, may be kept in gutta  percha bottles, the anhydrous acid in platinum only; but for the  most part, it is used as soon as made, its chief use being to  etch designs on glass-ware. Glass is also often etched by a blast  of sand (SiO2).    Notice the absence of O in the acids HF, HCI, HBr, HI, and that  each is a gas. HF is the only acid that will dissolve or act  appreciably on glass.    Chapter XVIII.    NITRIC ACID.    85. Preparation. Experiment 52.--To 10 g. KNO3 or NaNO3, in a  flask, add 15 cc. H2SO4. Securely fasten the cork of the d.t., as  HNO3 is likely to loosen it, and pass the other end to the bottom  of a t.t. held deep in a bottle of water (Fig. 26). Apply heat,  and collect 4 or 5 cc.of the liquid. The usual reaction is: KNO3  + H2SO4 = HKSO4 + HNO3. With greater heat, 2 KNO3 + H2SO4 = K2SO4  + 2HNO3. Which is most economical of KNO3? Of H2SO4? Instead of a  flask, a t.t. may be used if desired (Fig. 27).    86. Properties and Tests.    Experiment 53.--(1) Note the color of the prepared liquid. (2)  Put a drop on the finger; then wash it off at once. (3) Dip a  quill or piece of white silk into it; then wash off the acid.  What color is imparted to animal substances? (4) Add a little to  a few bits of Cu turnings, or to a Cu coin. Write the equation.  (5) To 2 cc.indigo solution, add 2 cc. HNO3. State the leading  properties of HNO3, from these tests.    87. Chemically Pure HNO3 is a Colorless Liquid.-- The yellow  color of that prepared in Experiment 52 is due to liquid NO2  dissolved in it. It is then called fuming HNO3, and is very  strong. NO2 is formed at a high temperature.    Commercial or ordinary HNO3, is made from NaNO3, this being  cheaper than KNO3; it is about half water.    88. Uses. HNO3 is the basis of many nitrates, as AgNO3, used for  photography, Ba(NO3)2 and Sr(NO3)2 for fire-works, and others for  dyeing and printing calico; it is employed in making aqua regia,  sulphuric acid, nitro-glycerine, gun-cotton, aniline colors,  zylonite, etc.    Enough experiments have been performed to answer the question  whether some acids can be prepared from their salts. H2SO4 is not  so made, because no acid is strong enough to act on its salts. In  making HCl, HNO3, etc., sulphuric acid was used, being the  strongest.    AQUA REGIA.    89. Preparation and Action. Experiment 54.--Into a t.t. put 2 cc.  HNO3, and 14 qcm. of either Au leaf or Pt. Warm in a flame. If  the metal is pure, no action takes place. Into another tube put 6  cc. HCl and add a similar leaf. Heat this also. There should be  no action. Pour the contents of one t.t. into the other. Note the  effect. Which is stronger, one of the acids, or the combination  of the two? Note the odor. It is that of Cl. 3HCl + HNO3 = NOCl +  2H2O + Cl2. This reaction is approximate only. The strength is  owing to nascent chlorine, which unites with Au. Au + 3Cl =  AuCl3. If Pt be used, PtCl4 is produced. No other acid except  nitro-hydrochloric will dissolve Au or Pt; hence the ancients  called it aqua regia, or king of liquids. It must be made as  wanted, since it cannot be kept and retain its strength.    CHAPTER XIX.    SULPHURIC ACID.    90. Preparation.    Experiment 55.--Having fitted a cork with four or five  perforations to a large t.t., pass a d.t. from three of these to  three smaller t.t., leaving the others open to the air, as in  Figure 28. Into one t.t. put 5 cc. H2O, into another 5 g. Cu  turnings and 10 cc. H2SO4, into the third 5 g. Cu turnings and 10  cc. dilute HNO3, half water. Hang on a ring stand, and slowly  heat the tubes containing H2O and H2SO4. Notice the fumes that  pass into the large t.t.    Trace out and apply to Figure 28 these reactions:--    (1) Cu + 2 H2SO4 = CuSO4 + 2 H2O + SO2.    (2) 3 Cu + 8 HNO3 = 3 Cu(NO3)2+ 4 H2O + 2 NO.    (3) NO + O = NO2.    (4) SO2 + H2O + NO2 =H2SO4 + NO.    (4) comes from combining the gaseous products in (1), (2), (3).  In (3), NO takes an atom of O from the air, becoming NO2, and at  once gives it up, to the H2SO3 (H2O + SO2), making H2SO4, and  again goes through the same operation of taking up O and passing  it along. NO is thus called a carrier of O. It is a reducing  agent, while NO2 is an oxidizing agent. This is a continuous  process, and very important, since it changes useless H2SO3 into  valuable H2SO4. If exposed to the air, H2SO3 would very slowly  take up O and become H2SO4.    Instead of the last experiment, this may be employed if  preferred: Burn a little S in a receiver. Put into an  evaporating-dish, 5 cc. HNO3, and dip a paper or piece of cloth  into it. Hang the paper in the receiver of SO2, letting no HNO3  drop from it. Continue this operation till a small quantity of  liquid is found in the bottle. The fumes show that HNO3 has lost  O. 2 HNO3 + SO2 = H2SO4 + 2 NO2.    91. Tests for H2SO4.    Experiment 56.--(1) Test the liquid with litmus. (2) Transfer it  to a t.t., and add an equal volume of BaCl2 solution. H2SO4 +  BaCl2 = ? Is BaSO4 soluble? (3) Put one drop H2SO4 from the  reagent bottle in 10 cc. H2O in a clean t.t., and add 1 cc. BaCl2  solution. Look for any cloudiness. This is the characteristic  test for H2SO4 and soluble sulphates, and so delicate that one  drop in a liter of H2O can be detected. (4) Instead of H2SO4, try  a little Na2SO4 solution. (5) Put two or three drops of strong  H2SO4 on writing-paper, and evaporate, high over a flame, so as  not to burn the paper. Examine it when dry. (6) Put a stick into  a t.t. containing 2 cc. H2SO4, and note the effect. (7) Review  Experiment 5. (8) Into an e.d. pour 5 cc. H2O, and then 15 cc.  H2SO4. Stir it meantime with a small t.t. containing 2 or 3 cc.  NH4OH, and notice what takes place in the latter; also note the  heat of the e.d.    The effects of (5), (6), (7), and (8) are due to the intense  affinity which H2SO4 has for H2O. So thirsty is it that it even  abstracts H and O from oxalic acid in the right proportion to  form H2O, combines them, and then absorbs the water.    92. Affinity for Water.--This acid is a desiccator or dryer, and  is used to take moisture from the air and prevent metallic  substances from rusting. In this way it dilutes itself, and may  increase its weight threefold. In diluting, the acid must always  be poured into the water slowly and with stirring, not water into  the acid, since, as H2O is lighter than H2SO4, heat enough may be  set free at the surface of contact to cause an explosion.  Contraction also takes place, as may be shown by accurately  measuring each liquid in a graduate, before mixing, and again  when cold. The mixture occupies less volume than the sum of the  two volumes. For the best results the volume of the acid should  be about three times that of the water.    93. Sulphuric Acid made on a Large Scale involves the same  principles as shown in Experiment 55, excepting that S02 is  obtained by burning S or roasting FeS2 (pyrite),    [Fig. 29.]    and HNO3 is made on the spot from NaNO3 and H2SO4. SO2 enters a  large leaden chamber, often 100 to 300 feet long, and jets of  steam and small portions of HNO3 are also forced in. The \"chamber  acid\" thus formed is very dilute, and must be evaporated first in  leaden pans, and finally in glass or platinum retorts, since  strong H2SO4, especially if hot, dissolves lead. See Experiment  124. Study Figure 29, and write the reactions. 2 HNO3 breaks up  into 2 NO2, H2O, and O. 94. Importance.--Sulphuric acid has been  called, next to human food, the most indispensable article known.  There is hardly a product of modern civilization in the  manufacture of which it is not directly or indirectly used.  Nearly a million tons are made yearly in Great Britain alone. It  is the basis of all acids, as Na2CO3 is of alkalies. It is the  life of chemical industry, and the quantity"]]]
