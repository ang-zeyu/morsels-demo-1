Rapp and Savary, the aides-de-camp of Desaix, remained plunged  in the most despairing grief beside the body of their chief, whom they  called their father, rather to express his unfailing kindness to them  than the dignity of his character. Out of respect to the memory of his  friend, the general-in-chief, although his staff was full, added these  two young officers in the quality of aides-de-camp.    Commandant Rapp (for such only was his rank at that time) was then, as he  has ever been, good, full of courage, and universally beloved. His  frankness, which sometimes bordered on brusqueness, pleased the Emperor;  and I have many times heard him speak in praise of his aide-de-camp, whom  he always styled, \"My brave Rapp.\" Rapp was not lucky in battle, for he  rarely escaped without a wound. While thus anticipating events, I will  mention that in Russia, on the eve of the battle of La Moskwa, the  Emperor said, in my presence, to General Rapp, who had just arrived from  Dantzic, \"See here, my brave fellow, we will beat them to-morrow, but  take great care of yourself. You are not a favorite of fortune.\"--\"That  is,\" said the general, \"the premium to be paid on the business, but I  shall none the less on that account do my best.\"    Savary manifested for the First Consul the same fervid zeal and unbounded  devotion which had attached him to General Desaix; and if he lacked any  of the qualities of General Rapp, it was certainly not bravery. Of all  the men who surrounded the Emperor, no one was more absolutely devoted to  his slightest wishes. In the course of these memoirs, I shall doubtless  have occasion to recall instances of this unparalleled enthusiasm, for  which the Duke de Rovigo I was magnificently rewarded; but it is just to  say that he did not bite the hand which rewarded him, and that he gave to  the end, and even after the end, of his old master (for thus he loved to  style the Emperor) an example of gratitude which has been imitated by  few.    A government decree, in the month of June following, determined that the  body of Desaix should be carried to the Hospice of St. Bernard, and that  a tomb should be erected on that spot, in the country where he had  covered himself with immortal glory, as a testimonial to the grief of  France, and especially that of the First Consul.          CHAPTER V.    The victory of Marengo had rendered the conquest of Italy certain.  Therefore the First Consul, thinking his presence more necessary at Paris  than at the head of his army, gave the command in chief to General  Massena, and made preparations to repass the mountains. On our return to  Milan, the First Consul was received with even more enthusiasm than on  his first visit.    The establishment of a republic was in accordance with the wishes of a  large number of the Milanese; and they called the First Consul their  Savior, since he had delivered them from the yoke of the Austrians.  There was, however, a party who detested equally these changes, the  French army which was the instrument of them, and the young chief who was  the author. In this party figured a celebrated artist, the singer  Marchesi.    During our former visit, the First Consul had sent for him; and the  musician had waited to be entreated, acting as if he were much  inconvenienced, and at last presented himself with all the importance of  a man whose dignity had been offended. The very simple costume of the  First Consul, his short stature, thin visage, and poor figure were not  calculated to make much of an impression on the hero of the theater; and  after the general-in-chief had welcomed him cordially, and very politely  asked him to sing an air, he replied by this poor pun, uttered in a tone  the impertinence of which was aggravated by his Italian accent: \"Signor  General, if it is a good air which you desire, you will find an excellent  one in making a little tour of the garden.\" The Signor Marchesi was for  this fine speech immediately put out of the door, and the same evening an  order was sent committing the singer to prison. On our return the First  Consul, whose resentment against Marchesi the cannon of Marengo had  doubtless assuaged, and who thought besides that the penance of the  musician for a poor joke had been sufficiently long, sent for him again,  and asked him once more to sing; Marchesi this time was modest and  polite, and sang in a charming manner. After the concert the First  Consul approached him, pressed his hand warmly, and complimented him in  the most affectionate manner; and from that moment peace was concluded  between the two powers, and Marchesi sang only praises of the First  Consul.    At this same concert the First Consul was struck with the beauty of a  famous singer, Madame Grassini. He found her by no means cruel, and at  the end of a few hours the conqueror of Italy counted one conquest more.    The following day she breakfasted with the First Consul and General  Berthier in the chamber of the First Consul. General Berthier was  ordered to provide for the journey of Madame Grassini, who was carried to  Paris, and attached to the concert-room of the court.    The First Consul left Milan on the 24th; and we returned to France by the  route of Mont Cenis, traveling as rapidly as possible. Everywhere the  Consul was received with an enthusiasm difficult to describe. Arches of  triumph had been erected at the entrance of each town, and in each canton  a deputation of leading citizens came to make addresses to and compliment  him. Long ranks of young girls, dressed in white, crowned with flowers,  bearing flowers in their hands, and throwing flowers into the carriage of  the First Consul, made themselves his only escort, surrounded him,  followed him, and preceded him, until he had passed, or as soon as he set  foot on the ground wherever he stopped.    The journey was thus, throughout the whole route, a perpetual fete; and  at Lyons it amounted to an ovation, in which the whole town turned out to  meet him. He entered, surrounded by an immense crowd, amid the most  noisy demonstrations, and alighted at the hotel of the Celestins. In the  Reign of Terror the Jacobins had spent their fury on the town of Lyons,  the destruction of which they had sworn; and the handsome buildings which  ornamented the Place Belcour had been leveled to the ground, the hideous  cripple Couthon, at the head of the vilest mob of the clubs, striking  the first blow with the hammer. The First Consul detested the Jacobins,  who, on their side, hated and feared him; and his constant care was to  destroy their work, or, in other words, to restore the ruins with which  they had covered France. He thought then, and justly too, that he could  not better respond to the affection of the people of Lyons, than by  promoting with all his power the rebuilding of the houses of the Place  Belcour; and before his departure he himself laid the first stone. The  town of Dijon gave the First Consul a reception equally as brilliant.    Between Villeneuve-le-Roi and Sens, at the descent to the bridge of  Montereau, while the eight horses, lashed to a gallop, were bearing the  carriage rapidly along (the First Consul already traveled like a king),  the tap of one of the front wheels came off. The inhabitants who lined  the route, witnessing this accident, and foreseeing what would be the  result, used every effort to stop the postilions, but did not succeed,  and the carriage was violently upset. The First Consul received no  injury; General Berthier had his face slightly scratched by the windows,  which were broken; and the two footmen, who were on the steps, were  thrown, violently to a distance, and badly wounded. The First Consul got  out, or rather was pulled out, through one of the doors. This occurrence  made no delay in his journey; he took his seat in another carriage  immediately, and reached Paris with no other accident. The night of the  2d of July, he alighted at the Tuileries; and the next day, as soon as  the news of his return had been circulated in Paris, the entire  population filled the courts and the garden. They pressed around the  windows of the pavilion of Flora, in the hope of catching a glimpse of  the savior of France, the liberator of Italy.    That evening there was no one, either rich or poor, who did not take  delight in illuminating his house or his garret. It was only a short  time after his arrival at Paris that the First Consul learned of the  death of General Kleber. The poniard of Suleyman had slain this great  captain the same day that the cannon of Marengo laid low another hero of  the army of Egypt. This assassination caused the First Consul the most  poignant grief, of which I was an eyewitness, and to which I can testify;  and, nevertheless, his calumniators have dared to say that he rejoiced at  an event, which, even considered apart from its political relations,  caused him to lose a conquest which had cost him so much, and France so  much blood and expense. Other miserable wretches, still more stupid and  more infamous, have even gone so far as to fabricate and spread abroad  the report that the First Consul had himself ordered the assassination of  his companion in arms, whom he had placed in his own position at the head  of the army in Egypt. To these I have only one answer to make, if it is  necessary to answer them at all; it is this, they never knew the Emperor.    After his return, the First Consul went often with his wife to Malmaison,  where he remained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35802"],[0,"Lusitania: Canti popolari portoghesi (#11)"],[1,"canzoncina francese, di cui si hanno varianti  in gran copia:        «Il était un petit navire,      qui n'avait jamais navigué:      quand il partit pour l'Amérique,      il portait vingt-cinq passagers.

Per esempio, in una di quelle pubblicate dal Braga,  dice il gabbiere rispondendo alle offerte del capitano:        «Não quero as tuas filhas,      Deus vol-as deixe criar:      o que te quero pedir,      se vós me quizeres dar,      é a Nau Catherineta,      para n'ella navegar.»    E l'altro:        «Essa Nau já não é minha,      é do Rei do Portugal:      elle, assim que lá chegar,      elle a mandará queimar.»    Cosí termina la romanza.]    [Nota 39: Il testo da me seguito (Almeida-Garrett) ha _Hespanha_.]          IL CACCIATORE    (O CAÇADOR)          IL CACCIATORE    (O CAÇADOR)[40]              Certa volta un cacciatore          fu a cacciar, come solea;          i suoi cani erano stanchi,          e perduto il falco avea.          Traversava un nero bosco,          quando il giorno tramontò;          a una quercia grande grande          esso allora si appoggiò.          Nell'alzare un tratto gli occhi,          vide cosa da ammirar;          una bella giovinetta          su tra' rami alti posar.[41]          Con gli sciolti suoi capelli          tutto l'albero fasciava;          col fulgor vivo degli occhi          tutto il bosco illuminava.          Ora dice la donzella          (state bene ad ascoltar):            «Su, coraggio, o cavaliere;          non ti devi spaventar.          Una cara e pia regina          a un gran re mi partorí:          ero in braccio alla nutrice,          quando sette fate qui          a giacer m'han condannata          per sett'anni, sette e un dí.[42]          Oggi compiono i sett'anni;          compirà domani il dí:          teco prendimi per Dio;          per Dio levami di qui!»            «Fa di attender fino all'alba          di domani, o bella mia;          voglio prima consigliarmi,          consigliarmi con la zia.»            Gli rispose la donzella,          (e ben disse in fede mia):            «Deh mal prenda al cavaliere          che non usa cortesia;          che mi lascia qui su l'albero,          senza farmi compagnia!»            Sul suo ramo ella rimase;          andò il giovine alla zia:          quando fé ritorno al bosco,          l'alba ancor non apparía.          Tutta scorre l'albereta,          ma la quercia non v'è piú;          corre e corre e chiama e chiama:          non risponde alcuno piú.            Scorge al fine in lontananza          galoppar giú per la via          di signori e cavalieri          molto bella compagnia:          seco portano l'Infanta,          perché il giorno si compía.          A tal vista il giovinetto          cadde come morto al suol;          ma riebbe tosto i sensi,          e la spada sguainò.            «Ah chi perde ciò ch'io perdo          grandemente è da punir!          da me stesso ecco mi giudico;          qui la vita vo' finir.»          NOTE      [Nota 40: HARDUNG, I, p. 87-89.    «O romance de Caçador, chamado nas colleções hespanholas _da Infantina_  [WOLF _und_ HOFFMANN, _Primavera_ ecc., II, p. 78], è, secundo a opinião  de Almeida-Garrett, de origem portugueza, porque os hespanhoes não se  lançaram no maravilhoso das fadas e incantamentos da eschola celtica de  França e Inglaterra.» Ivi, p. 87, in nota.    «Der Glaube an Feen und Hexen, Zauberei und Teufelspuk gehört den  romanischen Völkern wie den germanischen an. Mit einem leichten Zuge von  Schalkheit und Humor wird der Lehre gegeben, dass die einmal sich  darbietende Gelegenheit, Gutes zu thun oder sein Glück zu machen, wenn  sie einmal versäumt worden, nicht wieder kommt.» BELLERMANN, p. 273.    Ed il PUYMAIGRE, a proposito dell'analoga romanza spagnola: «Il y règne  un merveilleux, une teinte un peu vague, qui fait songer aux légendes  des bords du Rhin. La petite infante sur son arbre est la première à  faire des avances au chevalier. Tel est, dans les fictions espagnoles,  le rôle presque toujours attribué aux femmes. Celles-ci vont souvent un  peu loin dans leur amabilité. Remarquons-le pourtant, si les héroïnes du  Romancero ne sont pas des Lucrèces, il n'y a en général pas d'obscénité  dans les détails, pas de ces grosses gravelures dont nos fabliaux sont  remplis.» _Les vieux auteurs castillans_, t. II, p. 358.    Una lezione soltanto abbiamo, del _Caçador_; ma della _Infeitiçada_, che  molto le rassomiglia, se ne contano non meno di sette. Questa, secondo  l'Almeida-Garrett, è probabilmente originaria di Francia; ed egli pensa  che abbia varcato i Pirenei nella compagnia signorile di Enrico di  Borgogna. In materia di poesia popolare, difficilmente potendosi avere  una vera e propria certezza, conviene appagarsi delle ipotesi  ragionevoli; e questa mi sembra tale. Una bella romanza corrispondente  alla _Infeitiçada_ leggesi anche nei canzonieri spagnoli, e comincia:  «De Francia partio la nina.» È tra quelle tradotte, a parer mio non  sempre felicemente, da GIOVANNI BERCHET (_Opere edite ed inedite  pubblicate da Francesco Cusani_, Milano, 1863, p. 187). I raffronti mi  si offrirebbero in buon numero; ma basti citare i seguenti: FERRARO,  _Canti monferrini_, N.º 55 (_La figlia del re_); ARBAUD, _Chants_ ecc.,  t. II, p. 90 (_La fillha dou ladre_); BEAUREPAIRE, _Étude sur la poésie  pop. en Normandie_, Paris, 1856, p. 53; BLADÉ, _Poésies pop. de  l'Armagnac et de l'Agénais_, Paris, 1879, p. 76 e 114; PUYMAIGRE,  _Chants_, ecc., t. I, p. 153 (_L'amant discret_), e p. 158 (_La  rencontre_); BUJEAUD, _Chants et chansons pop. des provinces de  l'Ouest_, Niort. 1866, t. II, p. 90, ecc.    Anche il PUYMAIGRE (_Chants_ ecc., I, p. 158) crede all'origine francese  di queste romanze, e riferisce a sostegno della sua opinione una  canzonetta normanna d'Oliviero Basselin (***1818)[43], che trascrivo:        «Eh! qui vous passera le bois,      dictes, ma doulce amye!      Nous le passerons cette fois      sans point de villenye.»      Quand elle feust au bois si beau,      d'aymer y l'a requise:      «Je suis la fille d'un mezeau (lebbroso);      de cela vous advise.»      «De Dieu soit maudit le merdier,      qui la fille a nourrie!      Quand il ne la mest a mestier,      ou qu'il ne la marye,      ou ne la faict en lieu bouter      que homme n'en ayt envie!»      Quand elle fut dehors du bois,      elle se print à soubzrire:      «Belle qui menez tel desgoys (mormorio),      dictes-moy, qu'esse à dire?»      Et respondit a basse voix:      «Je suys la fille d'un bourgeois,      le plus grand de la ville:      l'on doibt couard maudire.»      «Femme je ne croiray d'un mois,      tant soit belle ou habile.»    La cosa, ripeto, è probabile, ma siamo lí; altro è certezza assoluta, ed  altro un'ipotesi, per quanto avvalorata da buone ragioni. Ma non voglio  passare sotto silenzio un'acuta osservazione dell'Arbaud, col quale  concordano l'Almeida-Garrett ed il Puymaigre: quella che in Francia è  figliuola d'un borghese e non piú, diventa, in Ispagna (e bisognava  aggiungere in Portogallo), di nascita regia. «Le génie espagnol»  conclude giustamente l'Arbaud, «anoblit tout ce qu'il touche.»  L'astuzia, poi, d'una giovine, che per fuggire vergogna si dà per figlia  di lebbroso, non è senza riscontri; e se ne trova una traccia in  BÉROALDE DE VERVILLE (_Le moyen de parvenir_, LXXVII, _Committimus_):  «Monsieur le médecin Taillerie menoit en pratique ce petit chirurgien  [un barbiere di Vendôme]; et pource qu'il avoit longtemps à être chez la  noblesse où il alloit, monsieur le médecin, jà veillard, menoit sa femme  qui étoit encore jeune, que le barbier accompagnoit en trousse. Étant en  chemin, le médecin demanda au barbier comme se portoit sa  femme.--Vraiment, dit-il, monsieur, il faut qu'elle se porte bien, si  elle veut; d'autant que je l'ai approivisionnée six bons coups, cette  nuit, sans ce qui s'est fait depuis.--Cela leur servit de risée, tant  qu'il furent arrivés à la noblesse, où ils alloient. Le soir, chacun  étant retiré, le médecin devisant avec sa femme, laquelle lui avoit  entamé le propos de ce jeune barbier, lui demandant, possible en  songeant à ce qu'il avoit dit tantôt, pourquoi il s'en servoit plutôt  que d'un autre:--Ma mie, se dit-il, je me sers de lui, pource que je  désire qu'il ait sa vie toute gagnée, d'autant qu'il n'a plus que deux  ans ou environ à travailler, à cause qu'il paroîtra tout ladre.--Cette  réponse fut cause que la demoiselle s'en dégoûta ecc.»    Scrivevo piú sopra che tra il _Caçador_ e la _Infeitiçada_ è grande  rassomiglianza: meglio era dire che in alcune lezioni si ha come  un'intrecciatura un composto delle due romanze; di cui la seconda si  chiude con un improvviso riconoscimento di fratello e sorella:        «Dizei-me vós, ó donzella,      dizei-me de quem sois filha?»        «Sou filha d'el-rei de França      e da rainha Constantina.»        «Arrenego eu de mulheres,      mais de quem n'ellas se fia!      Cuidei de levar amante;      levo uma irman minha!»        (Lez. di G. B. ALMEIDA-GARRETT.)]    [Nota 41: «Un ouvrage célèbre de l'ancienne littérature castillane, _La  Gran Conquista de Ultramar_, contient une version de l'histoire du  _Chevalier au cygne_: on y raconte qu'Isonberte prit la fuite pour  échapper à un mariage.
