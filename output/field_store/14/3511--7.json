Instead, they ordered her to give them  something to eat.    \"I never feed King's men if I can help it,\" she replied. \"The scamps  have fixed me so that I can't feed my own family in a decent manner.  They have run off with all my pigs and poultry except that old gobbler  you see in the yard there.\"    \"Well, you shall cook the old gobbler for us,\" exclaimed one who seemed  to be the leader of the party. Suiting the action to the word, he raised  his musket and shot the gobbler. One of his men brought it into the  house and gave it to Aunt Nancy, with orders to clean and cook it at  once. This, of course, made that stanch patriot very angry, and she gave  the Tories a violent tongue lashing.    It is probable that while she was dressing the turkey for the pot, the  Tories let some hint drop about the outrageous murder of Colonel John  Dooly, who was a warm friend of Aunt Nancy's. At any rate, she suddenly  changed her tactics. She ceased to storm and quarrel, the scowl left  her face, and she soon seemed to be in high good humor. She went about  getting the meal ready with great good will. She sent her little girl  to the spring after water, but told her to sound on the conch shell the  signal to \"keep close,\" so that her husband and his neighbors who were  with him might know there were Tories in the cabin.    While the daughter was gone after water, one of the Tories volunteered  to take her place in helping to get everything ready. Aunt Nancy  accepted his services, and joked with him with great freedom and  familiarity. Like all women of spirit and independence, Aunt Nancy  possessed a considerable fund of humor, and it stood her in good stead  now. She contrived to thoroughly interest the Tories, and it was not  long before they were in the most jovial frame of mind imaginable. They  had expected to find a bad-tempered, ill-conditioned woman; and they  were agreeably surprised when they found, instead, a woman who could  match their rude jests, and make herself thoroughly entertaining.    The Tories had brought a jug with them, and they were so pleased with  Aunt Nancy's seeming friendliness that they invited her to drink with  them. \"I'll take one swig with you,\" said Aunt Nancy, \"if it kills every  cow on the Island,\" meaning a neck of land at the junction of river and  creek where the Whig families of the neighborhood pastured their cattle  and hid them. The Tories laughed and drank, and then they laughed and  drank again. They kept this up until the old gobbler had been cooked to  Aunt Nancy's satisfaction; and by the time they were ready to sit down  to table they were in a very merry mood indeed.    They had stacked their arms within easy reach of where they had been  sitting and drinking; but Aunt Nancy had moved her table to the middle  of the floor, so as to be able to walk around it on all sides while  waiting on the Tories. In helping the men to the turkey and other  eatables that she had prepared, she frequently came between them and  their muskets. The Tories had hardly begun to eat before they called for  water. Aunt Nancy, expecting this, had used up in cooking all that had  been brought: consequently her daughter had to take the piggin and go  to the spring after a fresh supply. She went with instructions to signal  her father, and the neighbors who were with him, to come immediately to  the cabin. While her daughter was at the spring, Aunt Nancy managed to  pull off one of the boards that filled the space between the logs of the  house, and through this crack she slipped two of the muskets. She was  slipping the third through when her movements caught the eye of one of  the Tories. Instantly the men sprang to their feet, but Aunt Nancy  was now in her element. Quick as a flash she clapped the musket to her  shoulder, and threatened to shoot the first man that approached her. The  men, knowing her reputation as a fighter, and awed by her appearance,  hesitated. At last one bolder than the rest began to advance toward her.  She fired promptly, and at the report of the gun the man fell dead on  the floor.    Before the others could recover from their consternation, Aunt Nancy  had seized another musket, and held it in readiness to fire again. Her  daughter had now returned from the spring with the information that her  father and his neighbors would soon arrive. Directed by her mother,  the girl took the remaining musket and carried it out of the house. The  Tories, seeing that no time was to be lost in recovering their arms,  proposed to rush upon Aunt Nancy in a body and overpower her. But the  War Woman was equal to the occasion. She fired again, and brought down  another Tory. As she did so, the daughter, acting on her orders, handed  her another musket. Then, taking position in the doorway, she called on  the men to \"surrender their ugly Tory carcasses to a Whig woman.\"    [Illustration: Aunt Nancy captures the Tories 085]    The Tories agreed to surrender, and wanted to shake hands to make the  bargain binding; but Aunt Nancy kept her position in the doorway until  her husband and his friends made their appearance. The Whigs wanted  to shoot the Tories; but Aunt Nancy, whose blood was up, declared that  shooting was too good for them. \"They've murdered John Dooly,\" she  exclaimed; \"now let them hang for it!\" Thereupon the Tories were taken  out and hanged. The tree from which they swung was still standing as  late as 1838, and was often pointed out by old people who had lived  through the troubled times of the Revolution.    One day Aunt Nancy met a Tory going along the highway. She engaged him  in conversation, diverted his attention, and suddenly seized his gun and  wrenched it away from him. She then ordered him to take up the line of  march for a fort not far distant. Not daring to disobey, the man marched  before her, as many others had been compelled to do, and she turned him  over to the commander of the fort.    When Augusta was in the hands of the British, and their raiding parties  had been driven in by the Americans under Colonel Elijah Clarke, it  became necessary for that commander to get some positive information  in regard to the intentions of the British. At this juncture Aunt Nancy  came to the rescue. She disguised herself as a man, and went boldly into  the British camp. She remained there for several days, pretending to be  crazy. In this way she secured a great deal of important information,  and made haste to carry it to Colonel Clarke.    Aunt Nancy was once left in a fort with several other women and a number  of small children, her own among the rest. The men had gone out in  search of supplies. They had not expected an attack, and had left only  one of their number, a young man, to protect the women and children.  Suddenly a party of Tories and Indians made its appearance, and  surrounded the fort, which was nothing more than a stockade. The  yelling of the savages threw all the women and children into the utmost  confusion,--all except Aunt Nancy. That wonderful woman, who never knew  what fear was, only became more energetic in the face of danger. There  was a small cannon in the fort, but it was not in position to reach  the enemy with its fire. After trying her best to lift the cannon into  position, Aunt Nancy remembered the young man who had been left in  the fort, and looked about for him; but he was not to be seen. A close  search discovered him hiding under a cowhide. Aunt Nancy pulled him  out by the heels, and vowed she would make mince-meat of him unless he  helped her to move the cannon. The fellow knew perfectly well that Aunt  Nancy was not to be trifled with when her blood was up. He gave her the  necessary assistance. She aimed the cannon and fired it, and the Tories  and savages promptly took to their heels.    On another occasion when the river was high, it became necessary for the  Americans on the Georgia side to know what was going on on the Carolina  side; but no one could be induced to venture across. Hearing of the  difficulty, Aunt Nancy promptly undertook to go.    The freshet had swept away all the boats, but to Aunt Nancy this was  a trifling matter. She found a few logs, tied them together with  grapevines, and on this raft made the voyage across the river. She  gathered the necessary information, and made haste to communicate it to  the Georgia troops.    Aunt Nancy was the mother of eight children,--six sons and two  daughters. Her eldest daughter, Sally, married a man named Thompson,  who was as quicktempered as his mother-in-law. After the war, Aunt Nancy  moved to Brunswick. Sally and her husband followed a year or two later.  In passing through Burke County, they camped for the night by the  roadside. The next morning Thompson ordered a white man, who had been  hired as a teamster, to perform some duty. Thompson's tone was so  peremptory that the man returned an insolent answer, and refused. In a  fit of rage, Thompson drew his sword, and severed the man's head from  his body with one swinging stroke. He then drove the team himself until  he came to the first house, where he gave information that he had cut  off a fellow's head at the camp down the road, and that they \"had best  go and bury him.\" He then drove on, but was overtaken, arrested,  and lodged in jail at Waynesboro. As soon as Aunt Nancy heard of the  trouble, she made her appearance in the upcountry again. Within a few  days after her return, the jail was found open one morning, and  Thompson was gone. Speaking of this afterwards, Aunt Nancy was heard to  exclaim,--    \"Drat 'em! that's the way with 'em all. When they get into trouble, they  always send for me!\"    Not long after this episode, Mr. Benjamin Hart died. Aunt Nancy mourned  his loss for a while, and then married a young man. Then, as the saying  is, she \"pulled up stakes,\" and moved to what is now the State of  Alabama, on the Tombigbee."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#11)"],[1,"mt, his hammer  Mioelnir upon his shoulder.    Little Hnossa, the youngest of the Dwellers in Asgard, was there,  standing beside Heimdall, the Watcher for the Gods and the Keeper of the  Bridge to Urda's Well, when Odin All-Father and Frigga, his Queen, went  through the great gate with heads bent. \"Tomorrow,\" Hnossa heard Odin  say, \"tomorrow I shall be Vegtam the Wanderer upon the ways of Midgard  and Joetunheim.\"          PART II    ODIN THE WANDERER    [Illustration]    ODIN GOES TO MIMIR'S WELL: HIS SACRIFICE FOR WISDOM      And so Odin, no longer riding on Sleipner, his eight-legged steed; no  longer wearing his golden armor and his eagle-helmet, and without even  his spear in his hand, traveled through Midgard, the World of Men, and  made his way toward Joetunheim, the Realm of the Giants.    No longer was he called Odin All-Father, but Vegtam the Wanderer. He  wore a cloak of dark blue and he carried a traveler's staff in his  hands. And now, as he went toward Mimir's Well, which was near to  Joetunheim, he came upon a Giant riding on a great Stag.    Odin seemed a man to men and a giant to giants. He went beside the  Giant on the great Stag and the two talked together. \"Who art thou, O  brother?\" Odin asked the Giant.    \"I am Vafthrudner, the wisest of the Giants,\" said the one who was  riding on the Stag. Odin knew him then. Vafthrudner was indeed the  wisest of the Giants, and many went to strive to gain wisdom from him.  But those who went to him had to answer the riddles Vafthrudner asked,  and if they failed to answer the Giant took their heads off.    \"I am Vegtam the Wanderer,\" Odin said, \"and I know who thou art, O  Vafthrudner. I would strive to learn something from thee.\"    The Giant laughed, showing his teeth. \"Ho, ho,\" he said, \"I am ready for  a game with thee. Dost thou know the stakes? My head to thee if I cannot  answer any question thou wilt ask. And if thou canst not answer any  question that I may ask, then thy head goes to me. Ho, ho, ho. And now  let us begin.\"    \"I am ready,\" Odin said.    \"Then tell me,\" said Vafthrudner, \"tell me the name of the river that  divides Asgard from Joetunheim?\"    \"Ifling is the name of that river,\" said Odin. \"Ifling that is dead  cold, yet never frozen.\"    \"Thou hast answered rightly, O Wanderer,\" said the Giant. \"But thou hast  still to answer other questions. What are the names of the horses that  Day and Night drive across the sky?\"    \"Skinfaxe and Hrimfaxe,\" Odin answered. Vafthrudner was startled to  hear one say the names that were known only to the Gods and to the  wisest of the Giants. There was only one question now that he might ask  before it came to the stranger's turn to ask him questions.    \"Tell me,\" said Vafthrudner, \"what is the name of the plain on which the  last battle will be fought?\"    \"The Plain of Vigard,\" said Odin, \"the plain that is a hundred miles  long and a hundred miles across.\"    It was now Odin's turn to ask Vafthrudner questions. \"What will be the  last words that Odin will whisper into the ear of Baldur, his dear son?\"  he asked.    Very startled was the Giant Vafthrudner at that question. He sprang to  the ground and looked at the stranger keenly.    \"Only Odin knows what his last words to Baldur will be,\" he said, \"and  only Odin would have asked that question. Thou art Odin, O Wanderer, and  thy question I cannot answer.\"    \"Then,\" said Odin, \"if thou wouldst keep thy head, answer me this: what  price will Mimir ask for a draught from the Well of Wisdom that he  guards?\"    \"He will ask thy right eye as a price, O Odin,\" said Vafthrudner.    \"Will he ask no less a price than that?\" said Odin.    \"He will ask no less a price. Many have come to him for a draught from  the Well of Wisdom, but no one yet has given the price Mimir asks. I  have answered thy question, O Odin. Now give up thy claim to my head and  let me go on my way.\"    \"I give up my claim to thy head,\" said Odin. Then Vafthrudner, the  wisest of the Giants, went on his way, riding on his great Stag.    It was a terrible price that Mimir would ask for a draught from the Well  of Wisdom, and very troubled was Odin All-Father when it was revealed to  him. His right eye! For all time to be without the sight of his right  eye! Almost he would have turned back to Asgard, giving up his quest for  wisdom.    He went on, turning neither to Asgard nor to Mimir's Well. And when he  went toward the South he saw Muspelheim, where stood Surtur with the  Flaming Sword, a terrible figure, who would one day join the Giants in  their war against the Gods. And when he turned North he heard the  roaring of the cauldron Hvergelmer as it poured itself out of Niflheim,  the place of darkness and dread. And Odin knew that the world must not  be left between Surtur, who would destroy it with fire, and Niflheim,  that would gather it back to Darkness and Nothingness. He, the eldest of  the Gods, would have to win the wisdom that would help to save the  world.    And so, with his face stern in front of his loss and pain, Odin  All-Father turned and went toward Mimir's Well. It was under the great  root of Ygdrassil--the root that grew out of Joetunheim. And there sat  Mimir, the Guardian of the Well of Wisdom, with his deep eyes bent upon  the deep water. And Mimir, who had drunk every day from the Well of  Wisdom, knew who it was that stood before him.    \"Hail, Odin, Eldest of the Gods,\" he said.    Then Odin made reverence to Mimir, the wisest of the world's beings. \"I  would drink from your well, Mimir,\" he said.    \"There is a price to be paid. All who have come here to drink have  shrunk from paying that price. Will you, Eldest of the Gods, pay it?\"    \"I will not shrink from the price that has to be paid, Mimir,\" said Odin  All-Father.    \"Then drink,\" said Mimir. He filled up a great horn with water from the  well and gave it to Odin.    Odin took the horn in both his hands and drank and drank. And as he  drank all the future became clear to him. He saw all the sorrows and  troubles that would fall upon Men and Gods. But he saw, too, why the  sorrows and troubles had to fall, and he saw how they might be borne so  that Gods and Men, by being noble in the days of sorrow and trouble,  would leave in the world a force that one day, a day that was far off  indeed, would destroy the evil that brought terror and sorrow and  despair into the world.    Then when he had drunk out of the great horn that Mimir had given him,  he put his hand to his face and he plucked out his right eye. Terrible  was the pain that Odin All-Father endured. But he made no groan nor  moan. He bowed his head and put his cloak before his face, as Mimir took  the eye and let it sink deep, deep into the water of the Well of Wisdom.  And there the Eye of Odin stayed, shining up through the water, a sign  to all who came to that place of the price that the Father of the Gods  had paid for his wisdom.          [Illustration]    ODIN FACES AN EVIL MAN      Once, when his wisdom was less great, Odin had lived in the world of  men. Frigga, his Queen, was with him then; they had lived on a bleak  island, and they were known as Grimner the Fisherman and his wife.    Always Odin and Frigga were watching over the sons of men, watching to  know which ones they would foster and train so that they might have the  strength and spirit to save the world from the power of the Giants. And  while they were staying on the bleak island, Odin and Frigga saw the  sons of King Hrauding, and both thought that in them the spirit of  heroes could be fostered. Odin and Frigga made plans to bring the  children to them, so that they might be under their care and training.  One day the boys went fishing. A storm came and drove their boat on the  rocks of the island where Odin and Frigga lived.    They brought them to their hut, Odin and Frigga, and they told them they  would care for them and train them through the winter and that in the  spring they would build a boat that would carry them back to their  father's country. \"We shall see,\" said Odin to Frigga that night, \"we  shall see which of the two can be formed into the noblest hero.\"    He said that because Frigga favored one of the boys and he favored the  other. Frigga thought well of the elder boy, Agnar, who had a gentle  voice and quiet and kindly ways. But Odin thought more of the younger  boy. Geirrod, his name was, and he was strong and passionate, with a  high and a loud voice.    Odin took Geirrod into his charge, and he showed him how to fish and  hunt. He made the boy even bolder than he was by making him leap from  rock to rock, and by letting him climb the highest cliffs and jump  across the widest chasms. He would bring him to the den of the bear and  make him fight for his life with the spear he had made for him. Agnar  went to the chase, too, and showed his skill and boldness. But Geirrod  overcame him in nearly every trial. \"What a hero Geirrod will be,\" Odin  would often say.    Agnar stayed often with Frigga. He would stay beside her while she spun,  listening to the tales she told, and asking such questions as brought  him more and more wisdom. And Agnar heard of Asgard and of the Dwellers  in Asgard and of how they protected Midgard, the World of Men, from the  Giants of Joetunheim. Agnar, though he did not speak out, said in his own  mind that he would give all his life and all his strength and all his  thought to helping the work of the Gods.    Spring came and Odin built a boat for Geirrod and Agnar. They could go  back now to their own country. And before they set out Odin told Geirrod  that one day he would come to visit him. \"And do not be too proud to  receive a Fisherman in your hall, Geirrod,\" said Odin. \"A King should  give welcome to the poorest who comes to his hall.\"    \"I will be a hero, no doubt of that,\" Geirrod answered. \"And I would be  a King, too, only Agnar Little-good was born before me.\"    Agnar bade goodby to Frigga"]]]
