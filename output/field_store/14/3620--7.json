The pileus is convex, obtuse or umbonate, even, radiately  rugose-wrinkled, generally even and regular on the margin,  reddish-yellow or light bay.    The gills are attached to the stem, slightly decurrent, somewhat  crowded, whitish, then reddish-yellow.    The stem is thickened at the base, tapering toward the cap, flesh of the  stem is yellow. The veil is membranous and forms a persistent ring on  the stem.    It grows on decayed wood. I found it in large quantities, and tried to  make it L. granulosa, but I found it fit better L. amianthinus, which it  resembles very closely, but it is much larger and its habit is not the  same. I was not satisfied with this description and sent the specimens  to Prof. Atkinson, who set me right. It is a beautiful plant found on  decayed wood in September and October.      _Lepiota cepaestipes. Sow._    THE ONION STEMMED LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 37.--Lepiota cepaestipes. Pileus thin, white or  yellowish.]    Cepaestipes is from cepa, an onion and stipes, a stem, Pileus is thin at  first ovate, then bell-shaped or expanded, umbonate, soon adorned with  numerous minute brownish scales, which are often granular or mealy,  folded into lines on the margin, white or yellow, the umbo darker.    The gills are thin, close, free, white, becoming dingy with age or  drying.    The stem is rather long, tapering toward the apex, generally enlarged in  the middle or near the base, hollow. The ring is thin and subpersistent.  The spores are subelliptical, with a single nucleus, 8-10x5-8u.    The plants often cespitose, two to four inches high. Pileus is one to  two inches broad. It is found in rich ground and decomposing vegetable  matter. It is also found in graperies and conservatories. _Peck._    This plant derives its specific name from the resemblance of its stem to  that of the seed-stalk of an onion. One form has a yellow or yellowish  cap, while the other has a white or fair cap. It seems to delight to  grow in well rotted sawdust piles and hot houses. The specimens  represented in Figure 37 were collected in Cleveland and photographed by  Prof. H. C. Beardslee.      _Lepiota acutesquamosa. Wein._    THE SQUARROSE LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 38.--Lepiota acutesquamosa. Two-thirds natural  size, showing small pointed scales.]    Acutesquamosa is from _acutus_, sharp, and _squama_, a scale; so called  from the many bristling, erect scales on the pileus. The pileus is two  to three inches broad, fleshy, convex, obtuse, or broadly umbonate; pale  rusty with numerous small pointed scales, which are usually larger and  more numerous at the disk.    The gills are free, crowded, simple, white or yellowish.    The stem is two to three inches or more long; stuffed or hollow,  tapering upward slightly from a swollen base; below the ring rough or  silky, pruinose above, ring large. The spores are 7-8x4u.    They are found in the woods, in gardens, and frequently in greenhouses.  There is a slight difference between the specimens growing in the woods  and those in the greenhouse. In the latter the pubescent covering is  less dense and the erect scales are more numerous than in the former. In  older specimens these scales fall off and leave small scars on the cap  where they were attached. The specimens in Figure 38 were gathered in  Michigan and were photographed by Dr. Fisher of Detroit.      _Armillaria. Fr._    Armillaria, from armilla, a bracelet--referring to the ring upon the  stem. This genus differs from all the foregoing white-spored species in  having the gills attached to the stem by their inner extremity. The  spores are white and the stem has a collar, though a somewhat evanescent  one, but no wrapper at the base of the stem as in the Amanita and  Amanitopsis. By the collar the genus differs from the other genera which  are to follow.    The Amanita and Lepiota have the flesh of the stem and the pileus not  continuous, and their stems are, therefore, easily separated from the  cap, but in the Armillaria the gills and the pileus are attached to the  stem.      _Armillaria mellea. Vahl._    THE HONEY-COLORED ARMILLARIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 39.--Armillaria mellea. Two-thirds natural size.  Honey colored. Tufted with dark-brown fugitive hairs. Flesh white.]    Mellea, from melleus, of the color of honey. Cap fleshy, honey colored,  or ochraceous, striate on the margin, shaded with darker brown toward  the center, having a central boss-like elevation and sometimes a central  depression in full grown specimens, tufted with dark-brown fugitive  hairs. Color of the cap varies, depending upon climatic conditions and  the character of the habitat. Gills distant, ending in a decurrent  tooth, pallid or dirty white, very often showing brown or rust colored  spots when old. Spores white and abundant. Frequently the ground under a  clump of this species will be white from the fallen spores. Stem elastic  and scaly, four inches or more in length. Ring downy. Diameter of cap  from two to five inches. Manner of growth is frequently in tufts, and,  as with most of the Armillarias, generally parasitic on old stumps.    The veil varies greatly. It may be membranaceous and thin, or quite  thick, or may be wanting entirely, as will be seen in Figure 39; in  Figure 40 only a slight trace of the ring can be seen. The two plants  grew under very different environment; the last grew in the woods and  Figure 39 on a lawn in the city. The species is very common and grows  either in thin woods or in cleared lands, on the ground or on decaying  wood. Its favorite habit is about stumps. It is either solitary,  gregarious, or in dense clusters. It is very abundant about Chillicothe,  where I have seen stumps literally surrounded with it. It has a slight  acridity while raw, which it seems to lose in cooking. Those who like it  may eat it without fear, all varieties being edible.    Prof. Peck gives the following varieties:    A. mellea var. obscura--has the cap covered with numerous small black  scales.    A. mellea var. flava--has a cap yellow or reddish-yellow, otherwise  normal.    A. mellea var. glabra--has a smooth cap, otherwise normal.    A. mellea var. radicata--has a tapering root penetrating the soil.    A. mellea var. bulbosa--has a bulbous base.    A. mellea var. exannulata--has the cap smooth and even on the margin,  and the stem tapering at the base.    [Illustration: Figure 40.--Armillaria mellea. Two-thirds natural size,  showing double ring present.]      _Armillaria bulbigera. A. & S._    MARGINATE-BULBED ARMILLARIA.    [Illustration: Figure 41.--Armillaria bulbigera. Reddish-gray caps and  short bulbous stems.]    Bulbigera is from _bulbus_, a bulb, and _gero_, to bear.    The pileus is fleshy, three to four inches across, convex, then  expanded, obtuse, even, brownish, gray, sometimes reddish, dry,  fibrillose near the margin.    The gills are notched at the stem, pallid, crowded at first, at length  rather distant, becoming slightly colored.    The stem is distinctly bulbous, two to three inches long, stuffed,  pallid, fibrillose, ring oblique, fugacious. The spores are 7-10x5u.    I have found some very fine specimens in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe.  The stems were short and very bulbous, having hardly any trace of the  ring on the older specimens. The caps were obtusely convex and of a  grayish rufescent color. This species can readily be distinguished by  the distinctly marginate bulb at the base of the stem. The specimens in  Figure 41 were found in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe, October 2d. I  have no doubt of their edibility but I have not eaten them.      _Armillaria nardosmia. Ellis._    SPIKENARD-SMELLING ARMILLARIA. ELLIS.    [Illustration: Figure 42.--Armillaria nardosmia. One-half natural size,  showing the veil and incurved margin.]    Nardosmia is from _nardosmius_, the odor of nardus or spikenard.    The pileus is quite thick, firm and compact, thinner toward the margin,  strongly involute when young, grayish white and beautifully variegated  with brown spots, like the breast of a pheasant, rather tough, with a  separable epidermis, flesh white.    The gills are crowded, slightly notched or emarginate, somewhat  ventricose, white.    The stem is solid, short, fibrous, sheathed by a veil forming a ring  more or less evanescent. The spores are nearly round, 6u in diameter.    This is the most beautiful species of the genus, and from its  pheasant-like spotted cap, as well as its strong odor and taste of  spikenard or almonds, it is easily determined. The almond taste and odor  disappears in cooking. I found some very fine specimens around a pond in  Mr. Shriver's woods, east of Chillicothe. In older specimens the  cuticule of the caps frequently breaks into scales. Found in woods in  September and October.      _Armillaria appendiculata. Pk._    Appendiculata, bearing small appendages. Pileus is broadly convex,  glabrous, whitish, often tinged with rust-color or brownish rust-color  on the disk. Flesh white or whitish. Gills close, rounded behind,  whitish. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, solid, bulbous,  whitish, the veil either membraneous or webby, white, commonly adhering  in fragments to the margin of the pileus. Spores subelliptical, 8x5.    Pileus two to four inches broad. Stem 1.5-3.5 inches long; 5-10 lines  thick.    The general appearance of this species is suggestive of Tricholoma  album, but the appearance of a veil separates it from that fungus and  places it in the genus Armillaria. The veil, however, is often slightly  lacerated, or webby, and adherent to the margin of the pileus. Peck's  Report.    I have found this at Salem and Chillicothe.      _Tricholoma. Fr._    Tricholoma is from two Greek words meaning hair and fringe. This genus  is known by its stout, fleshy stem, without any evidence of a ring, and  by the gills being attached to the stem and having a notch in their  edges "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29233"],[0,"The 2008 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"the US Government  standard.

A title  standing alone is not capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and  President BUSH are chiefs of state. In Russia, the president is chief  of state and the premier is the head of the government, while in the  US, the president is both chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum:  See entries under Oil.    Petroleum products:  See entries under Oil.    Pipelines:  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for  transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum  products.    Political parties and leaders:  This entry includes a listing of  significant political organizations and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders:  This entry includes a listing  of a country's political, social, labor, or religious organizations  that are involved in politics, or that exert political pressure, but  whose leaders do not stand for legislative election. International  movements or organizations are generally not listed.    Population:  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the  Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics  registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past  and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents  one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world  and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993 Factbook,  demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have  explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the  HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin,  Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,  Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of  the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti,  Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda,  South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population growth rate:  The average annual percent change in the  population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths  and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate  may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining  how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs  of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,  roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid  population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and terminals:  This entry lists major ports and terminals  primarily on the basis of the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through  the facilities on an annual basis. In some instances, the number of  containers handled or ship visits were also considered.    Public debt:  This entry records the cumulative total of all government  borrowings less repayments that are denominated in a country's home  currency. Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which  reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and  public sector and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.    Radio broadcast stations:  This entry includes the total number of AM,  FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.    Railways:  This entry states the total route length of the railway  network and of its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow,  and dual. Other gauges are listed under note.    Reference maps:  This section includes world and regional maps.    Refugees and internally displaced persons:  This entry includes those  persons residing in a country as refugees or internally displaced  persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee according to a United  Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside his/her country of  nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of  persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership  in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or  unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country,  or to return there, for fear of persecution.\" The UN established the  Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to  handle refugee matters worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for  Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational  definition for a Palestinian refugee: \"a person whose normal place of  residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948  and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948  conflict.\" However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian  refugees not covered under the UNRWA definition. The term \"internally  displaced person\" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it  is used to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons  similar to refugees, but who remain within their own national territory  and are subject to the laws of that state.    Religions:  This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents  starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of  total population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's  major religions are described below.    Baha'i - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran in  1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one eternal  transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the unity of all  peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be achieved on  earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major world religions  reflect some truth or element of the divine, believes all were  manifestations of God given to specific communities in specific times,  and that Baha'u'llah is an additional prophet meant to call all  humankind. Bahais are an open community, located worldwide, with the  greatest concentration of believers in South Asia.    Buddhism - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C.  teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha \"the  enlightened one\"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual  enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four  Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path of  spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of which  we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of rebirth. Several  schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing often on the nature of  the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment can be achieved - for one  or for all, and by whom - religious orders or laity.    Basic Groupings       Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is  practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand,  with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West.  Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe  that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and  suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several lifetimes.       Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan Buddhism: Forms  of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and parts of  the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the Pali Canon  and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching. Unlike Theravada  Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the Buddha-nature is present in all  beings and all will ultimately achieve enlightenment.    Christianity - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central belief  maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the Hebrew  Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are salvific for  the world. Christianity is one of the three monotheistic Abrahamic  faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which traces its spiritual  lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its sacred texts include  the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or the Christian Gospels).    Basic Groupings       Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest established  western Christian church and the world's largest single religious body.  It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical structure with the  Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at the Vatican. Catholics  believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head of the Church from a  direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle Peter. Catholicism is  comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites - one Western (Latin-  Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite is by far the largest, making up  about 98% of Catholic membership. Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the  Maronite Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, are in communion  with Rome although they preserve their own worship traditions and their  immediate hierarchy consists of clergy within their own rite. The  Catholic Church has a comprehensive theological and moral doctrine  specified for believers in its catechism, which makes it unique among  most forms of Christianity.       Mormonism (including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints): Originating in 1830 in the United States under Joseph Smith,  Mormonism is not characterized as a form of Protestant Christianity  because it claims additional revealed Christian scriptures after the  Hebrew Bible and New Testament. The Book of Mormon maintains there was  an appearance of Jesus in the New World following the Christian account  of his resurrection, and that the Americas are uniquely blessed  continents. Mormonism believes earlier Christian traditions, such as  the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant reform faiths, are  apostasies and that Joseph Smith's revelation of the Book of Mormon is  a restoration of true Christianity. Mormons have a hierarchical  religious leadership structure, and actively proselytize their faith;  they are located"]]]
