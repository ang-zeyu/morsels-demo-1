Yes, a mighty Seer!      From Israel's royal line, must next appear;      Clad in the spirit of Elijah's power,      To prune the vineyard in th' eleventh hour;      To light the dawn of that effulgent day,      When King Messiah shall his sceptre sway.    The nineteenth century opened upon the world with far more favourable  auspices than any other age since the destruction of the people of the  Saints, and the reign of universal mystery. That spirit of freedom,  and independence of thought, of speech, and of action, which a few  centuries before had germinated in Europe, and which, after a stunted  growth amid the thorns and thistles of kingcraft, the tares of  priestcraft, and the weeds of superstition, in the old world,  transplanted itself, and obtained a more vigorous growth in the new  world, had now grown to a degree of maturity, and become consolidated,  opening resources for all nations, under the inestimable guarantee of  constitutional liberty.    To this standard the most enterprising, intelligent, and thinking of  every nation in Europe, had commenced to gather like a flowing stream.  Here, far separated from the practical influence, the false glare, the  empty show, or even the senseless name and titles of a self-styled or  imaginary nobility, their minds enlarged, their energies had full  scope, and their intellectual faculties, unfettered and free, and  surrounded with inexhaustible stores of unoccupied elementary riches,  soon opened and developed new channels of thought, of action, of  enterprise and improvement, the results of which have revolutionized  the world in regard to geographical knowledge, commerce,  intercommunication, transportation, travel, transmission of news, and  mutual acquaintance and interchange of thought.    The triumphs of steam over earth and sea, the extension of railroads,  and, above all, the lightning powers of the telegraph, are already,  gradually but rapidly, developing, concentrating and consolidating the  energies and interests of all nations, preparatory to the universal  development of knowledge, neighbourly kindness, and mutual  brotherhood.    Physically speaking, there seems to need but the consummation of two  great enterprises more, in order to complete the preparations  necessary for the fulfilment of Isaiah and other Prophets, in regard  to the restoration of Israel to Palestine, from the four quarters of  the earth, and the annual re-union of all nations to the new  standards, holy shrines and temples of Zion and Jerusalem, under the  auspices of that great, universal and permanent theocracy which is to  succeed the long reign of mystery.    One of these is the Great Eastern Railway from Europe to India and  China, with its branches, and accompanying telegraphic wires,  centering at Jerusalem.    The other is the Great Western Railway, with its branches and  accompanying telegraphic lines, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.    Politically speaking, some barriers yet remain to be removed, and some  conquests to be achieved, such as the subjugation of Japan, and the  triumph of constitutional liberty among certain nations where mind,  and thought, and religion are still prescribed by law.    These things achieved, even the most incredulous in regard to the  truth of Scripture Prophecy will be constrained to acknowledge, that,  physically and politically speaking, there is nothing impossible, or  even improbable, in the belief, that the twelve tribes of Israel will  be concentrated from all nations in their own land, that Jerusalem  will become the capitol of political government, the seat of  knowledge, and the shrine of worship, for the yearly resort of all the  nations and countries included in the world known to the Prophets of  old; while the Western Hemisphere, separated as it is, by two great  oceans, from the Old World, will naturally form its own central  capitol, its Zion, or New Jerusalem, to which all its tribes and  nations may perform their annual visits for instruction, devotion, and  mutual interchange of thought, of fellowship and affection.    Can the student of prophecy contemplate all these preparations,  clearly predicted thousands of years ago, and now bursting upon the  world with seemingly preconcerted connexion and exactness,  revolutionizing all things in a single age, and not be struck with the  reflection, that the hand of God must be in all this, and that moral  energy and spiritual light must be forthcoming from the heavens  commensurate with the physical and political preparations for a new  _Era_?    The same Prophets who have contemplated and described the development  of national freedom, universal intercourse, mutual peace, knowledge,  union of worship, reunion of the tribes of Israel; that have described  highways, trains of cars flying as it were with a cloud, ocean  steamers, ships, litters and swift beasts, as the instruments of  restoration, have also predicted that, in connexion with all these  preparations, a new dispensation should be manifested, a new covenant  established, \"A Standard\" for the nation, \"An Ensign\" for the people.  In short, \"Swift Messengers,\" \"Teachers,\" Prophets would be  commissioned, revelations be manifested, and a new organization be  developed, fitted to the times, and with principles and laws adapted  to the reorganization, order, and government of a renovated world.    Where and when should we look for the \"grain of mustard seed,\" the  germ, the nucleus of such organization? Of course in a land of free  institutions, where such organization could be legally developed, and  claim constitutional protection, until sufficiently matured to defend  itself against the convulsions, the death struggles, the agonizing  throes, which precede the dissolution of the long reign of mystic  tyranny; and at a time when modern freedom had been consolidated,  nationalized, and its standard recognized among the nations.    Such an organization should also be looked for, in its first  development, as cotemporary with the first dawn or development of the  physical and political means provided for the same result.    The beginning of the present century gave birth to those chosen  instruments who were destined to hold the keys of restoration for the  renovation of the world.    The United States of America was the favoured nation raised up, with  institutions adapted to the protection and free development of the  necessary truths, and their practical results. And that Great Prophet,  Apostle, and Martyr--                              JOSEPH SMITH,    was the Elias, the Restorer, the presiding Messenger, holding the keys  of the \"_Dispensation of the fulness of times_.\"    Yes, that extraordinary man, whose innocent blood is now dripping  fresh, as it were, from the hands of assassins and their accessories,  in the United States, was the chosen vessel honoured of God, and  ordained by angels, to ordain other Apostles and Elders, to restore  the Church and kingdom of God, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and to be  a messenger in the spirit and power of Elijah, to prepare the way of  the Lord. \"For, behold, he will suddenly come to his temple!\"    Like John, who filled a similar mission preparatory to the first  advent of the Son of God, he baptized with water unto repentance, for  the remission of sins; like him, he was imprisoned; and like him, his  life was taken from the earth; and finally, like all other true  messengers, his message is being demonstrated by its progressive  fulfilment--the powers, gifts, and signs following the administration  of his message in all the world, and every minute particular of his  predictions fulfilling in the order of events, as the wheels of time  bring them due.    But in one important point his message differs from all former  messages. The science of Theology revived by him will never decline,  nor its keys be taken from the earth. They are committed to man for  the last time. Their consummation will restore the tribes of Israel  and Judah; overthrow all corrupt institutions; usher in the reign of  universal peace and knowledge; introduce to the earth her lawful and  eternal King, the crucified Nazarene, the resurrected Messiah; banish  darkness and death, sorrow, mourning and tears, from the face of our  globe; and crown our race with the laurels of victory and eternal  life.    Ages yet unborn will rise up and call him blessed. A thousand  generations of countless myriads will laud his praise and recount his  deeds, while unnumbered nations bask in the light and enjoy the  benefits of the institution founded by his instrumentality.    His kindred, the nation that gave him birth, and exulted at his death,  nay, his very murderers and their posterity, will yet come bending  unto him, and seek his forgiveness, and the benefits of his labours.    But, Oh! the pain! the dark despair! the torments of a guilty  conscience! the blackness of darkness, in the lower hell, which the  guilty wretches will experience before that happy day of deliverance!    Oh! the countless myriads of the offspring of innocent and honourable  men who will walk the earth, tread on the ashes, or plow and reap over  the bones and dust of those miserable murderers and their accomplices  who have consented to the shedding of innocent blood! ere the final  trump shall sound, which calls up their sleeping dust from its long  slumbers in the tomb, and their spirits from the prison of the damned.    And even when this, to them almost interminable, period has rolled  away, and they rise from the dead, instead of a welcome exaltation to  the presence and society of the sons of God, an eternal banishment  awaits them. They never can come where God and Christ dwell, but will  be servants in the dominions of the Saints, their former victims.    This extraordinary personage was born in Sharon, Windsor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35490"],[0,"Seaside Studies in Natural History. Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay. (#11)"],[1,"a dark brownish-red, with  a light, milk-white margin, tinged with blue, the tentacles and other  pendent appendages having a somewhat different hue from the disk. The  ovaries are flesh-colored, the curtain formed by the expansion of the  lobes of the mouth is dark brown, while the tentacles are of different  colors, some being yellow, others purple, and others reddish brown or  pink.        [Illustration: Fig. 45. Scyphistoma of a Discophore; Aurelia      flavidula. (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 47. Strobila of a Discophore; Aurelia      flavidula. (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 46. Scyphistoma, older than Fig. 45.      (_Agassiz_.)]    Strange to say, this gigantic Discophore is produced by a Hydroid  measuring not more than half an inch in height when full grown; could  we follow the history of any egg laid by one of these Discophorae in  the autumn, and this has indeed been partially done, we should see  that, like any other planula, the young hatched from the egg is at  first spherical, but presently becomes pear-shaped, and attaches  itself to the ground. From the upper end tentacles project (see Fig.  45), growing more numerous, as in Fig. 46, though they never exceed  sixteen in number. As it increases in height constrictions take place  at different distances along its length, every such constriction being  lobed around its margin, till at last it looks like a pile of  scalloped saucers or disks strung together (see Fig. 47). The topmost  of these disks falls off and dies; but all the others separate by the  deepening of the constrictions, and swim off as little free disks  (Fig. 48), which eventually grow into the enormous Jelly-fish  described above. These three phases of growth, before the relation  between them was understood, have been mistaken for distinct animals,  and described as such under the names of Scyphistoma, Strobila, and  Ephyra.        [Illustration: Fig. 48. Ephyra of a Discophore; Aurelia flavidula.      (_Agassiz_.)]      _Aurelia_. (_Aurelia flavidula_ PER. et LES.)        [Illustration: Fig. 49. Aurelia seen in profile, reduced.      (_Agassiz_.)]    Another large Discophore, though by no means to be compared to the  Cyanea in size, is our common Aurelia (Figs. 49, 50) Its bluish-white  disk measures from twelve to fifteen inches in diameter, but its  dimensions are not increased by the tentacles, which have no great  power of contraction and expansion, and form a short fringe around its  margin, widening and narrowing slightly as the tentacles are stretched  or drawn in. It is quite transparent, as may be seen in Fig 49, where  all the fine ramifications of the chymiferous tubes as well as the  ovaries, are seen through the vault of the disk. Fig. 50 represents  the upper surface, with the ovaries around the mouth, occupying the  same position as those of the Cyanea, though they differ from the  latter in their greater rigidity, and do not hang down in the form of  pouches. The males and females in this kind of Jelly-fish may be  distinguished by the difference of color in the reproductive organs,  which are rose-colored in the males, and of a dull yellow in the  females. The process of development is exactly the same in the Aurelia  as in the Cyanea, though there is a very slight difference in their  respective Hydroids. They are, however, so much alike, that one is  here made to serve for both, the above figures being taken from the  Hydroid of the Aurelia. It is curious, that while, as in the case of  the Aurelia and Cyanea, very dissimilar Jelly-fishes may arise from  almost identical Hydroids, we have the reverse of the proposition, in  the fact that Hydroids of an entirely distinct character may produce  similar Jelly-fishes.        [Illustration: Fig. 50. Aurelia flavidula, seen from above; _o_      mouth, _e e e e_ eyes, _m m m m_ lobes of the mouth, _o o o o_      ovaries, _t t t t_ tentacles, _w w_ ramified tubes. (_Agassiz_.)]    The embryos or little planulae, hatched from the Cyanea and Aurelia in  the fall, seem to be gregarious in their mode of life, swimming about  together in great numbers till they find a suitable point of  attachment, and assume their fixed Hydroid existence. The Cyaneae,  however, when adult, are usually found singly, while the Aureliae, on  the contrary, seek each other, and commonly herd together.      _The Campanella_. (_Campanella pachyderma_ A. AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 51. Campanella seen in profile; greatly      magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 52. Same, seen from below.]    The Campanella (Fig. 51) is a pretty little Jelly-fish, not larger  than a pin's head, reproduced directly from eggs, without passing  through the Hydroid stage. During its early stages of growth it  probably remains attached to floating animals, thus leading a kind of  parasitic existence; but as its habits are not accurately known, this  cannot be asserted as a constant fact respecting them. The veil in  this Jelly-fish is very large, forming pendent pouches hanging from  the circular canal (see Fig. 51), and leaving but just room enough for  the passage of the proboscis between the folds. It may not be amiss to  introduce here a general account of this organ, which occurs in many  of the Medusae, though it has very different proportions in the various  kinds. It is a delicate membrane, hanging from the circular tube, so  as partially to close the mouth of the bell, leaving a larger or  smaller opening for the passage of the water, which is taken in and  forced out again by the alternate expansions and contractions of the  bell.    There are but four chymiferous tubes in the Campanella, and four stiff  tentacles, which in consequence of the peculiar character of the veil  appear, when the animal is seen in profile, to start from the middle  of the disk. The ovaries consist of eight pouches, placed near the  point of junction of the four chymiferous tubes. (Fig. 52.) This  little Medusa is of a dark yellowish color with brownish ocellated  spots, scattered profusely over the upper part of the disk.      _Circe_. (_Trachynema digitale_ A. AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 53. Trachynema digitale; about twice the      natural size.]    Among the Jelly-fishes, the position of which is somewhat doubtful, is  the Circe (Fig. 53), differing greatly in outline from the ordinary  Jelly-fishes. As may be seen in Figure 53, the bell forms but a small  portion of the animal; it rises in a sharp cone on the summit,  thinning out at the lower edge, to form the large cavity in which  hangs the long proboscis and the eight ovaries, four of which may be  seen in Fig. 53 crowded with eggs. The Circe differs in consistency,  as well as in form, from other Jelly-fishes. It is hard and horny to  the touch, and the veil, usually so light and filmy, is here a thick  folded membrane, which at every stroke of the animal forces the water  in and out of the cavity. It is very active, moving by powerful jerks,  each one of which throws it far on its way. It advances usually in  straight lines; or, if it wishes to change its direction, it drives  the water out of the veil suddenly on one side or the other, so as to  shoot off, sometimes at right angles with its former path. Four large  pedunculated eyes, hidden in the figure by the tentacles, stand out  prominently from the circular tube. When the animal is in motion, the  tentacles are carried closely curled around the edge of the disk, as  in Fig. 53, where the Circe is represented under a magnifying power of  two and a half diameters. This Jelly-fish is of a delicate rose color,  the tentacles assuming, however, a dark-purple tint at their  extremities when contracted.      _Lucernaria_. (_Haliclystus auricula_ CLARK.)        [Illustration: Fig. 54. Group of Lucernaria attached to eel-grass;      natural size.]        [Illustration: Fig. 55. Lucernaria seen from the mouth side.]    One of the prettiest and most graceful, as well as one of the most  common of our Jelly-fishes, is the Lucernaria (Fig. 54). It has such  an extraordinary contractility of all its parts, that it is not easy  to describe it under any definite form or position, since both are  constantly changing; but perhaps of all its various attitudes and  outlines none are more normal to it than those given in Fig. 54. It  frequently raises itself in the upright position represented here by  the individual highest on the stem, spreading itself in the form of a  perfectly symmetrical cup or vase, the margin of which is indented by  a succession of inverted scallops, the point of junction between every  two scallops being crowned by a tuft of tentacles. But watch it for a  while, and the sides of this vase turn backward, spreading completely  open, till they present the whole inner surface, with the edges even  curved a little downward, drooping slightly, and the proboscis rising  in the centre. In such an attitude one may trace with ease the shape  of the mouth, the lobes surrounding it, as well as the tubes and  cavities radiating from it toward the margin. A touch is, however,  sufficient to make it close upon itself, shrinking together in the  attitude of the third individual in Fig. 54, or even drawing its  tentacles completely in, and contracting all its parts till it looks  like a little ball hanging on the stem. These are but a few of its  manifold changes, for it may be seen in every phase of expansion and  contraction. Let us now look for a moment at the details of its  structure. The resemblance to a cup or vase, as in the upper figure of  the wood-cut (Fig. 54), is deceptive; for a vase is hollow, whereas  the Lucernaria, though so delicate and transparent that its upper  surface, when thus stretched, seems like a mere film, is nevertheless  a solid gelatinous mass, traversed by certain channels, cavities, and  partitions, but otherwise continuous throughout. The peduncle by which  it is attached is but an extension of the"]]]
