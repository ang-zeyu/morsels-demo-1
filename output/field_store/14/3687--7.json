What  could she do? Her hands had pummelled every part of the boy's body;  brooms were broken on him without beneficial results. That little imp  had, according to her, the flesh of a dog. Accustomed outside of the  house to the tremendous butting of the steers, to the cruel trampling  of the cows, to the clubs of herders and butchers who beat the band of  vagabond bull-fighters without compassion, his mother's blows seemed to  him a natural event, a continuation of his life outside prolonged inside  the home, and he accepted them without the least intention of mending  his ways, as a fee which he must pay in exchange for his sustenance,  chewing the hard bread with hungry enjoyment, while the maternal  maledictions and blows rained on his back.    Scarcely was his hunger appeased when he fled from the house, taking  advantage of the freedom in which Senora Angustias left him when she  absented herself on her round of duties.    In Campana Street, that venerable haunt of the bull-fighters where the  gossip of the great doings of the profession circulated, he received  information about his companions that gave him tremors of enthusiasm.    \"Little Cobbler, a bull-fight to-morrow.\"    The towns in the province celebrated the feasts of their patron saints  with cape-teasing of bulls which had been rejected from the great  plazas, and to these the young bull-fighters went in the hope of being  able to say on their return that they had held the cape in the glorious  plazas of Aznalcollar, Bollullos, or Mairena. They started on the  journey at night with the cape over the shoulder if it were summer, or  wrapped in it if winter, their stomachs empty, their heads full of  visions of bulls and glory.    If the trip were of several days' journey they camped in the open, or  they were admitted through charity to the hayloft of an inn. Alas for  the grapes, melons, and figs they found by the way in those happy  times! Their only fear was that another band, another _cuadrilla_,  possessed of the same idea, would present itself in the _pueblo_ and set  up an opposition.    When they reached the end of their journey, with their eyebrows and  mouths full of dust, tired and foot-sore from the march, they presented  themselves to the alcalde and the boldest among them who performed the  functions of director talked of the merits of his men. All considered  themselves happy if the municipal generosity sheltered them in a stable  of the hostelry and regaled them with a pot of stew in addition, which  they would clean up instantly. In the village plaza enclosed by wagons  and boards, they let loose aged bulls, regular forts of flesh covered  with scabs and scars, with enormous saw-edged horns; cattle which had  been fought many years in all the feasts of the province; venerable  animals that \"understood the game,\" such was their malice. Accustomed to  one continual bull-fight they were in the secret of the tricks of the  contest.    The youths of the _pueblo_ pricked on the beasts from their place of  safety and the people longed for an object of diversion greater than the  bull--in the bull-fighters from Seville. These waved their capes, their  legs trembling, their courage borne down by the weight of their  stomachs. A tumble, and then great clamor from the public! When one in  sudden terror took refuge behind the palisades, rural barbarity received  him with insults, beating the hands clutching at the wood, pounding him  on the legs to make him jump back into the ring. \"Get back there,  poltroon! Fraud, to turn your face from the bull.\"    At times one of the young swordsmen was borne out of the ring by four  companions, pale as a sheet of white paper, his eyes glassy, his head  fallen, his breast like a broken bellows. The veterinary came, quieting  them all on seeing no blood. The boy was suffering from the shock of  being thrown some yards and falling on the ground like a rag torn from a  piece of clothing. Again it was the agony of having been stepped on by a  beast of enormous weight. A bucket of water was thrown on his head and  then, when he recovered his senses, they treated him to a long drink of  brandy. A prince could not be better cared for!    To the ring again! And when the herder had no more bulls to let out and  night was drawing near, two of the _cuadrilla_ grasped the best cape  belonging to the society and holding it by its edges went from one  viewing stand to another soliciting a contribution. Copper coins fell  upon the red cloth in proportion to the pleasure the strangers had given  the country people; and, the bull-baiting ended, they started on their  return to the city, knowing that they had exhausted their credit at the  inn. Often they fought on the way over the distribution of the pieces of  copper which they carried in a knotted handkerchief. Then the rest of  the week, they recounted their deeds before the fascinated eyes of their  companions who had not been members of the expedition.    Once Senora Angustias spent an entire week without hearing from her son.  At last she heard vague rumors of his having been wounded in a  bull-scrimmage in the town of Tocina. _Dios mio_! Where might that town  be? How reach it? She gave up her son for dead, she wept for him, she  longed to go; and then as she was getting ready to start on her  journey, she saw little Juan coming home, pale, weak, but talking with  manly joy of his accident.    It was nothing--a horn-stab in one thigh; a wound a fraction of an inch  deep. And in the shamelessness of triumph he wanted to show it to the  neighbors, affirming that a finger could be thrust into it without  reaching its end. He was proud of the stench of iodoform that he shed as  he walked, and he talked of the attention they had shown him in that  town, which he considered the finest in Spain. The wealthiest citizens,  one might say the aristocracy, interested themselves in his case, the  alcalde had been to see him and later paid his way home. He still had  three _duros_ in his pocket, which he handed to his mother with the  generosity of a great man. So much glory at fourteen! His satisfaction  was yet greater when some genuine bull-fighters in Campana Street fixed  their attention on the boy and asked him how his wound was getting  along.    His companion in poverty was Chiripa, a boy of the same age, with a  small body and malicious eyes, without father or mother, who had tramped  about Seville ever since he had attained the use of his faculties.  Chiripa was a master of the roving life and had travelled over the  world. The two boys started on a journey empty of pocket, without other  equipment than their capes, miserable cast-offs acquired for a few  _reales_ from a second-hand clothing store.    They clambered cautiously into trains and hid under seats. Often they  were surprised by a trainman and, to the accompaniment of kicks and  blows, were left by him on the platform of some solitary station while  the train vanished like a lost hope. They awaited the arrival of  another, spending the night in the open, employing the cunning of  primitive man to satisfy their necessities, crawling round about country  houses to steal some solitary chicken, which, after wringing the fowl's  neck, they would broil over a fire of dry wood and devour scorched and  half raw, with the voracity of young savages.    Often when they slept in the open air near a station awaiting the  passing of a train, a couple of guards would come up to them. On seeing  the red bundles that served as pillows for these vagabonds, their  suspicions were quieted. They gently removed the boys' caps, and on  finding the hairy appendage they went away laughing without further  investigation. These were not young thieves; they were apprentices who  were going to the _capeas_. And in this tolerance there was a mixture of  sympathy for the national sport and of respect for the obscure  possibilities of the future. Who could tell if one of these ragged  youths, despite his present appearance of poverty, might not in the  future be a \"star of the art,\" a great man who would kill bulls for the  entertainment of kings, and live like a prince, and whose deeds and  sayings would be exploited in the newspapers?    One afternoon, the Little Cobbler was left alone in a town of  Extremadura. For the admiration of the rustic audience which applauded  the famous bull-fighters \"come purposely from Seville,\" the two boys  threw _banderillas_ at a fierce and ancient bull. Little Juan stuck his  pair into the beast and was posing near a view-stand, proudly receiving  the popular ovation of tremendous hand-clappings and proffers of cups of  wine, when an exclamation of horror sobered him in his intoxication of  glory. Chiripa was no longer on the ground of the plaza; only the  _banderillas_ rolling in the dust, one slipper and a cap were there. The  bull was moving about as if irritated by some obstacle, carrying hooked  on one of his horns a bundle of clothing resembling a puppet. With the  violent tossing of his head the shapeless roll was loosened from the  horn, ejecting a red stream, but before touching the ground it was  caught by the opposite horn which in its turn tossed it about during  what seemed an interminable time. At last, the sorry bulk fell to the  dust and there it stayed, flabby and inert, like a punctured wine-skin  expelling its contents.    The herder with his leaders took the bull into the corral, for no one  else dared go near him, and poor Chiripa was carried upon a stretcher to  a wretched little room in the town-house that served as a jail. His  companion looked at him with a face as white as if made of plaster.  Chiripa's eyes were glazed and his body was red with the blood which  could not be stopped by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#11)"],[1," than they would if allowed to run with the old one.\"    The shelter should be in the shape of a long box, 5 or 6 feet wide and 3  or 4 feet high, set upon legs, with a good floor and roof. Divide into  separate apartments 6 feet long (longer would be better), the front of  each apartment to be furnished with a swinging door of strong screen  wire, with hinges at the top, and a latch on the bottom. A trough 6  inches square, should run the entire length of pen at rear side; one end  of the trough should be made several inches lower than the other, so  that the water could be drawn off. With this arrangement the water can  be turned in at one end of trough, and be drawn off and changed as often  as desired. The lower end of the trough should be a little deeper than  the other end to prevent the water from running over. Each apartment is  furnished with a box 3 feet long and 13 inches wide. On one side of the  box, and near one end is made a round hole about 4 inches in diameter,  and provided with a sliding cover, so by means of a stick it can be  opened or closed from the outside. This is so the mink can be closed up  while the pen is being cleaned.    [Illustration: Mink Enclosure in Detail.]    On the top of the box and at the other end should be a door large enough  to put in grass, straw, etc., for the nest, and take out young. It is  necessary that they have an abundance of pure soft water, fresh air,  desirable shade and plenty of exercise. These conditions secure for the  mink a good quality of dark fur and good health. Brush, weeds, etc., are  allowed to grow up in the yard, but not near enough to the fence to  admit of their climbing up and out.    The fence for the enclosure should be of poultry netting of one-inch  mesh. If of larger mesh the young animals will escape. The general plan  for the fence should be the same as described under the heading,  \"Enclosures.\" There should be separate apartments for the males and  females, and also some smaller breeding pens. As it is not advisable to  attempt handling the animals, each compartment should be provided with a  small gate so that the animals may be driven from one pen to the other.  During the breeding season, and afterwards, while the young animals are  under the care of the mother, the same general methods of handling as is  recommended in skunk raising, should be adopted.    At all times, plenty of fresh water must be provided, and the enclosures  should be so arranged that the water will be distributed to all parts.  While the mink is always found near the water, it is not a water animal,  as is the muskrat, and a large body of same is not needed. A spring or a  small stream is all that is needed; and a pond may be dug in each of the  large enclosures.    Careful and regular feeding is advised. The mink is strictly a  carnivorous animal, and always prefers fresh food. The matter of  supplying sufficient food will be more difficult than in the case of  the skunk and muskrat. As they are fond of fish, if one is near a place  where they may be obtained, the feeding will be comparatively easy. They  should not, however, be fed on fish alone. An occasional fowl will be  acceptable, also rabbit, muskrat, etc.    The natural home and breeding place of the mink is near the water. Their  den is often under an old stump, tree or in some drift pile. The nest  where the young are born generally being in the ground. When the animals  become tame enough, the raiser should provide dens similar to those used  in their wild state. These can be made by burying tile in the ground and  in other ways making artificial burrows. A few hollow logs placed in the  enclosure would be enjoyed by the animals.    Many report that the males kill the young. This should be guarded  against by keeping the males separate. Some hesitate about starting a  \"minkery\" for fear that the animals will not fur properly. There is no  danger on that point if properly fed, watered and given homes in keeping  with those they lived in when roving at their own free will. This only  brings out more forcibly the fact that those who are going to be the  most successful mink raisers should have a natural aptitude for the  business--trappers, hunters, animal lovers, etc. Who has made the  greatest success at raising stock in your neighborhood--the man who  loves stock or someone who thought they saw a fortune in the business  but neither loved animals or knew anything about them? We venture the  answer, without fear of contradiction, that it has been the party who  loves and delights in stock. Remember, this applies to fur animals as  well as horses, sheep and cattle.          CHAPTER VIII.    OPOSSUM RAISING.      The opossum is a southern animal and is found in abundance in most parts  of the Southern States. In late years they have been moving farther  northward and are now found, though not numerous, as far north as  Central Pennsylvania; but are found most plentifully in the wooded  portions of the South, where they are such a common animal as to be well  known to all.    They are slow moving and inoffensive, having no means of defense  whatever. When approached, they make a great show by opening the mouth,  and present a rather fierce appearance, but when touched by man or  animal, they pretend to be dead, and this very characteristic habit has  given rise to the expression, \"playing 'possum.\"    While the opossum is a nocturnal animal, it is sometimes seen in  daylight, but this is of rare occurrence. They do not hibernate but will  remain in the dens during cold weather, and do not like to roam about  when the leaves are dry and rustly.    The dens are, as a rule, located in the ground, under a rock, log or  tree, and are quite shallow; the nest at the extremity being lined with  leaves or grass. They also den in hollow logs and stumps occasionally,  and in natural openings in rock bluffs.    The young of this animal are born in the last half of April and the  beginning of May, the number of young varying from six to twelve, and  sometimes even more. When born they are very small and imperfectly  formed and are immediately placed by the mother in the pouch on her  belly, where they remain until they have attained a perfect form and  have become large enough to walk about. After being placed in the pouch,  they attach themselves to the teats of the mother, and remain in that  condition until they have become large enough to move about.    On leaving the pouch, they quite often ride about, when tired, on the  mother's back, holding fast by winding their tails about that of the  parent. They will reach their full growth within a year, if the  conditions are favorable--that is, if they have plenty of food, etc. In  captivity, when well cared for, they attain considerable size by  midwinter.    The opossum is omnivorous, feeding alike on animal and vegetable food,  but it prefers flesh to fruit. They feed on carrion, and on any small  animal which their slow movements will allow of capturing, also on eggs  and young birds, for they are good climbers. They are quite fond of wild  fruits, such as persimmons, polk berries, apples and paw-paws; also of  certain vegetables, especially onions. They also eat mice, insects, etc.    Opossums are hunted extensively in the South, and when pursued they  usually climb the nearest tree, unless they are close to the den. As an  article of food they are highly esteemed, especially by the colored  people, and find a ready sale in the market.    While the fur of this animal is not, strictly speaking, a valuable one,  to the prospective fur-farmer it is well worth considering, especially  if located near a market. At present prices the young animals by  midwinter, will average a dollar each in value, when selling both the  skin and carcass. The ease with which they may be raised is also an  important factor, so that on the whole, in many sections, they will be  found to be a profitable animal to handle.    Opossums are fairly good climbers and the enclosure should have a wide  strip of tin around, as described elsewhere in the chapter on  Enclosures. They will also gnaw out of wooden enclosures if there is a  crack or any chance to get a start. They will readily climb out of the  enclosure if made of wood unless covered or at least partially covered.  There has been no better or cheaper material found for constructing  fences for opossum raising purposes than galvanized wire.    They are not much given to digging and the wire need not be buried very  deep in the earth. If the ground is solid, 18 inches will be deep  enough. The animals, if properly fed, watered and cared for, will soon  become accustomed to their quarters, and make little or no effort to  escape. The young will become tame and quite playful.    The natural home of the opossum can be described as south of a line  drawn west from New York City through Pennsylvania, Northern Ohio and  Indiana, south of Chicago, through Iowa near Des Moines, and into  Nebraska near Omaha, extending about half way into Nebraska, then South  through Kansas, all of Oklahoma and the lowlands or the Eastern half of  Texas. The opossum is not a cold weather animal, and in its wild state  would freeze if it inhabited territory much farther north than the  northern boundary of the line shown. A severe winter a few years ago, is  said to have frozen large numbers in their dens in Southern Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and parts of West Virginia, Indiana and Illinois.    In their natural or wild state, they often hole up in shallow dens, old  logs, trees, etc., and while they are endowed with the instinct of  \"playing 'possum\" when injured, their instinct along other lines seems  very shallow, as they do not always know enough to \"get in out of the  cold;\" in other words, on the approach of severe winter weather, they do  not all seek deep dens where the ground does not freeze.    While the natural home of the opossum is in the"]]]
