I have reserved a stook of bunches of blackberries by inserting  their stems in water, grape-fashion, for a succession of food for  bait. I have also caught scores, if not hundreds, on bird-lime, but  this injures their plumage and is somewhat troublesome, especially to  anyone not accustomed to handle it. I have also caught them in a bat  fowling net at night out of thick hedges. I find a trap cage or cages  best, for bullfinches generally go in small parties, and I have taken  two out at once from two separate cages, while others waited round and  were caught afterwards.    The well-known and easily imitated call of the bullfinch at this  season of the year (autumn) appears to have a greater attraction--for  what reason I cannot say--than at any other period; there is also a  great difference in individual call birds. The best should be  selected. When fresh caught, bullfinches are best placed in a low kind  of box cage about six inches deep, with wires only on one side. Such  cage may be easily made out of a soap box from the grocer's, giving  them a good supply of canary and hemp seed and water. If they refuse  to eat the seed, which sometimes happens, give a few blackberries or  such other food as they feed on at the time; the seed of the dock is  always a favourite dish in the winter, and the probability is in a day  or two they will take to the seed, which should be strewed over the  bottom of the cage.\"    The nightingale trap (perhaps not quite so well known) is a compromise  between the bow net and the spring trap; it is useful for taking most  insectivorous birds, is easily made by anyone possessing a little  mechanical ability, and is to be bought cheaply at most of the bird  shops. As I have been asked, however, by many correspondents in the  country, where such things are to be procured, they are informed that  in the classic retreat of the Seven Dials--that is to say, in the  street running through from Charing Cross to Bloomsbury--are to be  found many bird fanciers' shops where the nightingale trap can be  procured for something under a couple of shillings.    In setting all of these traps be sure to touch them with the hands as  little as possible, especially if setting a baited trap. Gloves are  recommended to be worn, scented with musk when baiting for stoats,  weasels, etc, and with vervain or valerian if baiting for cats.    I will proceed now to the consideration of decoys. Decoys are of two  classes, fixed and mechanical, or those easily removable and natural.  Of the former the most important is what is called a decoy for wild  fowl, viz, a large tract of land and water specially fitted up with  nets of the sorts most suitable for taking ducks and similar birds,  and near which it is unlawful to fire a gun. For a thoroughly  exhaustive and interesting article on decoy ponds, see Folkard's \"Wild  Fowler,\" pp. 44-94.    Some singular and highly original methods of catching birds are  described by ancient and modern authors. Pennant, in his \"Arctic  Zoology,\" vol. ii, page 550, describes a quaint but doubtful method of  decoying wild geese in Siberia; he also, at page 311, records how  immense numbers of willow grouse are taken by a curious mode of  netting.    Folkard also mentions an ingenious way of capturing wild fowl in their  own element by the aid of calabashes. This, however, I think, \"must be  seen to be believed,\" though I am bound to confess that it is partly  corroborated by other writers.    Of the lasso or the \"bolas,\" used in South America for capturing  certain animals and birds, no description need be given, as this  method of trapping is only to be performed by a person trained from  childhood to ride and throw the lasso. The same remark applies to the  use of the blowpipe (see Bates's \"Amazons\"), and the Australian  \"boomerang\" and \"throwstick.\"    Regarding the use of the blowpipe, I see that an American author on  Taxidermy, who has written a very good book on the subject--albeit he  has, perhaps unwittingly, cribbed my title of \"Practical  Taxidermy\"--appears to have attained remarkable proficiency in the use  of this weapon, and describes also his method of making it, thus:    \"The blowpipe is of great service for collecting warblers and other  small birds. It should be made by encasing a long glass tube in wood,  to prevent breaking. The ordinary glass tubes used by glass-blowers  make good blowpipes, which should have a diameter of 0.5 in. and be  not less than 6 ft. long.    To encase a pipe with wood, take two strips of straight-grained pine,  and plane or \"gouge\" out a half-round groove the full length of each,  glue them together, and wire firmly over the glass pipe. When the glue  is dry, remove the wires, and plane the wood round until it has a  diameter of 1.5 in.; if smaller it will sag, and not do good shooting.  Putty balls should be used, and blown with a quick puff, which is  easily acquired by practice. The putty is thickened with whiting until  the pellets will roll hard, but they should not be dry enough to  crumble.    With this novel gun I have killed as many as fifty-six warblers in  less than a day, and spoiled but few specimens in killing.\"    Rowland Ward, also, in his \"Sportsman's Handbook,\" appears to favour  the use of the blowpipe, and very correctly says at page 9:    \"The implement is so simple and so easily constructed that the price  of it is inappreciable. About 3 ft. length of any straight metal or  wooden tubing, 0.75 in. diameter, through which a pellet the size of a  marble may be thrown, will serve well, but an even longer tube may be  chosen. The pellet should be of clay or any putty, rolled in the hand  to easily pass through the barrel without too much windage. It should  not touch the mouth, but be lightly placed just in the orifice, by  stopping which with the thumb the tube can be conveniently carried  loaded, muzzle up, ready for the most rapid use. To propel the pellet  the puff must be sudden and powerful. There is a proper way of  effecting this. When a practitioner first begins to use the blow-pipe,  it is a common error to eject the breath only direct from the lungs;  he should acquire the habit of inflating his cheeks, so as to make a  storage of wind, as it were, for each shot; that, added to the breath  from the lungs, gives a force which will sometimes astonish him. The  hand follows the eye in aim, and practice will often develop  unthought-of proficiency.\"    The catapult is also a first-rate weapon in a skilful hand for  procuring small birds. I must confess I cannot use it as well as some  young friends of mine, who knock over nearly every sitting bird they  aim at, and even now and then are successful with such difficult shots  as at swallows on the wing; a novice, on the contrary, nearly always  succeeds in stinging his fingers and missing the object aimed at.    I remember also, when a boy, using a very effective weapon, which I  should describe as a catapult gun. It was, if I recollect aright,  fashioned similarly to a cross bow, the bolt, however, from which was  ejected from a little wash-leather bag by means of very powerful  India-rubber springs, which being released by a trigger delivered a  bullet or small shot from a tube with amazing force and precision. I  do not know if such guns are made now, but I should imagine that  anyone with a little ingenuity could construct one for himself.    All these appliances, with the well-known air-gun, are chiefly of use  for collecting the smaller birds with a minimum of noise. There are  several small collecting guns made which do the work required in a  much more thorough manner. Messrs. Bland, gun-makers, of Birmingham,  some time since showed me an elegant little double-barrelled central  fire gun, which seems to be just the thing for the purpose. Messrs.  Clarke, of Leicester, also make a small single-barrelled central fire  .410-bore collector's gun, but as before observed, they are only fit  for small birds at short ranges.    I have lately procured a small walking-stick gun .410-bore, central  fire, with a removeable stock, which I have found of great service in  collecting small birds--bringing down swifts and swallows flying, at  moderate ranges.    Many birds, especially males, in the breeding season, are taken by  decoying them into nets or snares by tame or wild birds of the  opposite sex; in fact, advantage was wont to be taken of the pugnacity  or devotion of the Ruffes when \"hilling,\" by previously setting  springes or nets on their battle-ground, into which said snares they  danced, when courting or fighting (see Daniel, vol. U, p. 212).    Poachers also sometimes take cock pheasants by bringing an armed  gamecock into the woods and hiding themselves, while the domesticated  bird challenges and gives battle to the unarmed wild one. The boldness  of cock pheasants during their breeding time is wonderful; many  instances having come under my notice of wild pheasants coming from  the woods to do battle with aviary ones, and also with farm-yard  \"roosters.\"    A highly interesting account of the ludicrous actions and  insensibility to fear of the capercailzie, and blackgame, when  courting (and through which they are easily shot), is given by a  writer on Norway in the Field of March 27, 1875; and this brings us to  the greatest of all aids for the procuring of specimens--I mean the  shot-gun and rifle. So much of success depends upon being a clever  marksman, and also upon having a good general knowledge of woodcraft,  that although for instructions in guns and shooting I refer the reader  to Col. Hawker, Daniel, Blaine, \"Stonehenge,\" Folkard, Greener,  \"Wildfowler,\" and many others, yet a few words on some peculiar, and  in some cases well-known, methods of decoying birds within gunshot,  may not be out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#11)"],[1," personages than they really are, and often enough they pay  for the privilege. This is only natural, seeing that even an  innkeeper is human. Charges suitable for a _milord_ or a millionaire  have been inflicted on Browns, Joneses, and Robinsons simply because  they demanded such treatment--for fear they would not be taken for  \"gentlemen.\" Such people are not numerous among real traveling  automobilists; they are mostly found among that class who spend the  week-end at Brighton, or dine at Versailles or St. Germain or \"make  the fete\" at Trouville. They are known instinctively by all, and are  only tolerated by the hotel landlord for the money they spend.    The French cook's \"_batterie de cuisine_\" is a thing which is  fearfully and wonderfully displayed in all the splendour of polished  steel and copper; that is, it is frequently so displayed in the  rather limited acquaintance which the general public has with the  _cuisine_ of a great hotel or restaurant, whether it be in Paris,  London, or New York.    [Illustration: In French Hotels]    In provincial France it is quite another thing. The _chef-patron_ of  a small hotel in a small town may be possessed of an imposing battery  of pots and pans, but often, since he buys his _patisserie_ and  sweetmeats of the local pastry-cook, and since his guests may  frequently not number a dozen at a time, he has no immediate use for  all of his _casseroles_ and _marmites_ and _plats ronds_ and  _sauteuses_ at one time, and accordingly, instead of being  picturesquely hung about the wall in all their polished brilliancy,  they are frequently covered with a coating of dull wax or, more banal  yet, enveloped in an ancient newspaper with only their handles  protruding. It's a pity to spoil the romantically picturesque idea  which many have of the French _batterie de cuisine_, but the  before-mentioned fact is more often the case than not.    Occasionally, on the tourist-track, there is a \"show hotel,\" like the  Hotel du Grand Cerf at Louviers (its catering in this case is none  the worse for its being a \"show-place,\" it may be mentioned) where  all the theatrical picturesqueness of the imagination may be seen.  There is the timbered sixteenth-century house-front, the heavily  beamed, low ceiling of the _cuisine_, the great open-fire chimney  with its _broche_, and all the brave showing of pots and pans,  brilliant with many scrubbings of _eau de cuivre_, to present quite  the ideal picture of its kind to be seen in France--without leaving  the highroads and searching out the \"real thing\" in the byways.    On the other hand, in the same bustling town, is the Mouton d'Argent,  equally as excellent in its catering (perhaps more so), where the  kitchen is about the most up-to-date thing imaginable, with a modern  range, mechanical egg-beaters, etc. This last is nothing very  wonderful to an American, but is remarkable in France, where the  average cook usually does the work quite as efficiently with a  two-tined fork, or something which greatly resembles a chop-stick.    In the _cuisine_ electric lights are everywhere, but the  up-to-dateness here stops abruptly; the _salle a manger_ is bare and  uninviting, and the rooms above equally so, and the electric light  has not penetrated beyond the ground floor. Instead one finds ranged  on the mantel, above the cook-stove in the kitchen, a regiment of  candlesticks, in strange contrast to the rest of the furnishings.  Electric bells, too, are wanting, and there is still found the row of  jangling _grelots_, their numbers half-obliterated, hanging above the  great doorway leading to the courtyard.    The European waiter is never possessed of that familiarity of speech  with those he serves, which the American negro waiter takes for  granted is his birthright. It's all very well to have a  cheerful-countenanced waiter bobbing about behind one's chair, indeed  it's infinitely more inspiring than such of the old brigade of  mutton-chopped English waiters as still linger in some of London's  City eating-houses, but the disposition of the coffee-coloured or  coal-black negro to talk to you when you do not want to be talked to  should be suppressed.    The genuine French, German, or Swiss waiter of hotel, restaurant, or  cafe is neither too cringingly servile, nor too familiar, though  always keen and agile, and possessed of a foresight and initiative  which anticipates your every want, or at any rate meets it promptly,  even if you ask for it in boarding-school French or German.    There is a keen supervision of food products in France, by  governmental inspection and control, and one is certain of what he is  getting when he buys his _filet_ at the butcher's, and if he  patronizes hotels and restaurants of an approved class he is equally  sure that he is eating beef in his _bouille_ and mutton in his  _ragout_.    Horse-meat is sold largely, and perhaps certain substitutes for  rabbit, but you only buy horsemeat at a horse butcher's, so there is  no deception here. You buy horse-meat as horse-meat, and not as beef,  in the same way that you buy oleomargarine as oleomargarine, and not  as butter, and the French law deals hardly with the fraudulent seller  of either.    The law does not interfere with one's private likes and dislikes, and  if you choose to make your breakfast off of oysters and Creme  Chantilly--as more than one American has been known to do on the  Paris boulevards--there is no law to stop you, as there is in  Germany, if you want beer and fruit together. Doubtless this is a  good law; it sounds reasonable; but the individual should have sense  enough to be able to select a menu from non-antagonistic ingredients.    Foreigners, by which English and Americans mean people of Continental  Europe, know vastly more of the art of catering to the traveller than  do Anglo-Saxons. This is the first, last, and intermediate verse of  the litany of good cheer. We may catch up with our Latin and Teuton  brothers, or we may not. Time will tell, if we don't expire from the  over-eating of pie and muffins before that time arrives.    [Illustration: Road Map of France]      Chapter V  The Grand Tour    [Illustration: Grand Tour]    The advantages of touring by automobile are many: to see the country,  to travel agreeably, to be independent of railways, and to be an  opportunist--that is to say to be able to fly off at a tangent of  fifty or a hundred kilometres at a moment's notice, in order to take  in some fete or fair, or celebration or pilgrimage.    \"_Le tourisme en automobile_\" is growing all over the world, but  after all it is generally only in or near the great cities and towns  that one meets an automobile on the road. They hug the great towns  and their neighbouring resorts with astonishing persistency. Of the  one thousand automobiles at Nice in the season it is certain that  nine-tenths of the number that leave their garages during the day  will be found sooner or later on the famous \"Corniche,\" going or  coming from Monte Carlo, instead of discovering new tracks for  themselves in the charming background of the foot-hills of the  Maritime Alps.    In England, too, the case is not so very different. There are a  thousand \"week-enders\" in automobiles on the way to Brighton,  Southsea, Bournemouth, Scarborough, or Blackpool to ten genuine  tourists, and this even though England and Wales and Scotland form a  snug little touring-grounds with roads nearly, if not always,  excellent, and with accommodations--of a sort--always close at hand.    In Germany there seems to be more genuine touring, in proportion to  the number of automobiles in use, than elsewhere. This may not prove  to be wholly the case, as the author judges only from his  observations made on well-worn roads.    Switzerland is either all touring, or not at all; it is difficult to  decide which. At any rate most of the strangers within its frontiers  are tourists, and most of the tourists are strangers, and many of  them take their automobiles with them in spite of the \"feeling\"  lately exhibited there against stranger automobilists.    Belgium and Holland, as touring-grounds for automobilists, do not  figure to any extent. This is principally from the fact that they are  usually, so far as foreign automobilists are concerned, included in  more comprehensive itineraries. They might be known more intimately,  to the profit of all who pass through them. They are distinctly  countries for leisurely travel, for their areas are so restricted  that the automobilist who covers two or three hundred kilometres in  the day will hardly remember that he has passed through them.    Northern Italy forms very nearly as good a touring-ground as France,  and the Italian engineers have so refined the automobile of native  make, and have so fostered automobilism, that accommodations are  everywhere good, and the tourist to-day will not lack for supplies of  _benzina_ and _olio_ as he did a few years ago.    The bulk of the automobile traffic between France and Italy enters  through the gateway of the Riviera, and, taken all in all, this is by  far the easiest, and perhaps the most picturesque, of routes.  Alternatives are through Gap and Cuneo, Briancon and Susa, Moutiers  and Aosta, or by the Swiss passes, the latter perhaps the most  romantic of routes in spite of their difficulties and other  objections.    [Illustration: On English Roads]    Automobiling in Spain is a thing of the future, and it will be a big  undertaking to make the highroads, to say nothing of the by-roads,  suitable for automobile traffic. The present monarchs' enthusiasm for  the sport may be expected, however, to do wonders. The most that the  average tourist into Spain by automobile will want to undertake is  perhaps the run to Madrid, which is easily accomplished, or to  Barcelona, which is still easier, or to just step over the border to  Feuntarabia or San Sebastian, if he does not think overrefined  "]]]
