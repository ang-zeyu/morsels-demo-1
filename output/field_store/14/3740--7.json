Towards the middle of the month the garrison was much cheered by the  arrival on the scene of a plucky American journalist, who had ridden  from the Cape straight through the Boer lines, and who came with all the  buoyancy of the outer world to delight the ears of the British with  tales of Lord Methuen's advance. Other news now and then filtered in,  and this the Colonel, either _viva voce_ or by means of his typewriter,  promptly shared with the whole interested community.    [Illustration: FACSIMILE OF WRITING IN ALBUM BY COL. BADEN-POWELL]    To make it evident that Mafeking was determined to keep lively and  aggressive in spite of intermittent bombardment, several more gallant  sorties were made, and on each occasion the little place came off with  flying colours. Commander Cronje, disgusted, finally took himself off  with some twenty waggons to Riceters (Transvaal), leaving his guns with  the remaining commandoes and relegating to them the task of reducing the  truculent town to submission.    Ruses, which are as the breath of his nostrils to the Boer in warfare,  continued to be tried on Colonel Baden-Powell, who may be said to have  almost enjoyed new chances to whet his wits and showed himself the last  person to be caught napping. Indeed, some one at the time remarked that  if they wanted to take him in they would have to get up very early in  the morning and stay awake all night into the bargain! The latest Boer  device was to make a show of going away and leaving a big gun apparently  in a state of being dismantled. This of course was what in vulgar  phrase might be called a \"draw\" for the besieged. But the Colonel was  not to be drawn; his smart scouts continually found the enemy hidden in  force, and thereupon put every one on their guard. Mafeking, in fact,  \"sat tight\" and--winked!    [Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL LORD KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM.    Photo by Bassano, London.]    Meanwhile the inhabitants were pushing out advanced works with good  effect, and began to feel more and more confident that their pluck and  patience would ultimately receive their reward. Their bomb-proof  shelters were becoming works of art. They were no longer rabbit-warrens,  but well-ventilated apartments, roofed with the best steel rails and  sand-bags, and lighted by windows resembling portholes. Great ingenuity  was displayed in the wedding of safety with comfort, and the owners soon  began to grow interested in the artistic quality of their improvised  retreats!    On the 25th of November another gallant sortie was made, and the  Chartered Company's Police, with magnificent pluck and determination,  attacked Eloffsfort and kept the Boers from further encroachment.    For some days nothing unusual took place. The Boers continued to annoy  with their 10-ton gun and the Boer flag began to float over the fortified  places surrounding the town. In fact, there was a somewhat wearisome  monotony in the programme of daily life. The laconic report at that time  of one of the sufferers was that the sole resource was to \"snipe and  wait!\" Fortunately pressure elsewhere was beginning to draw off some of  the hostile legions, and consequently the activity of the assault on the  town was diminished. It was quite evident that Colonel Baden-Powell had  been found a nasty nut to crack, and that his earthworks, his trenches,  his underground shelters, his night attacks, and his hundred-and-one  minor dodges, which had been craftily invented to test the amiability of  the ingenuous Boer, were scarcely appreciated. Indeed, the worthy Cronje,  when wisely taking himself off, was reported to have owned that the  Mafeking blend of Baden-Powell-dynamite-mine-and-best-Sheffield was  decidedly infernal!    On this subject the correspondent of the _Times_, who was cooped in  Mafeking, said: \"The significance of the dynamite mines which surround  our position cannot be under-estimated. Had the Boers any trustworthy  information as to the whereabouts of the mines, the town would probably  have been stormed weeks ago. The general ignorance on their part of the  locality of the mines creates corresponding dread. The mines may be  taken as a material effort on the part of Rhodesia to assist Imperial  prestige and interests. The Postmaster-General of Rhodesia lent Mr.  Kiddy, manager of telegraphs, to superintend the laying of mines,  telephones, and field-telegraphs. The services so rendered have been  invaluable.\"    Of the Commandant another of the beleaguered band wrote: \"Commanding us  we have a man than whom we could have none better. The Colonel is always  smiling, and is a host in himself. To see 'B. P.,' as he is  affectionately termed, whistling down the street, deep in thought,  pleasing of countenance, cheerful and confident, is cheering and  heartening--far more cheering and heartening than a pint of dry  champagne. Had any man in whom the town placed less confidence been in  command, disaster might have befallen Mafeking; and if we are able to  place the name of Mafeking upon the roll of the Empire's outposts which  have fought for the honour and glory of Britain, it will be chiefly  because Baden-Powell has commanded us.\"    That our good old friend _Punch_ should, in his old age, cause almost  intoxicating delight is a fact worthy of note. A copy brought by  Reuter's cyclist-runner was safely carried into the town, to the intense  joy of its inhabitants. It contained the cartoon by Sir John Tenniel in  which John Bull is represented as telling the Boer that if he wishes to  fight it must be a fight to the finish. The journal was read and re-read  even to the advertisements, and gloated over for many days. What has now  become of it is a question of interest. There are doubtless many  collectors of war trophies who would pay more than his weight in gold  for Mr. Punch after he had lived through and shared in the vicissitudes  of siege life in Mafeking.    The pluck of Colonel Baden-Powell seemed to be epidemic. Young boys, and  even women, clamoured to do their share of the work, and strove to  display a perfectly unruffled front in face of shot and shell. In one  house some ladies stuck to their abode while the breastworks were being  built, and employed the interval in playing and singing the National  Anthem, thus stimulating and cheering the workers outside, who joined  heartily in the chorus. On the 28th of November grand preparations were  made for an evening attack, and these were quietly inspected by Colonel  Baden-Powell in the small hours of the morning. But the Boers, whose  spies were for ever busy, were forewarned and had evacuated their  position. From the advanced trench in the river-bed some successful  sniping at the foe on the brickfields was carried on, however, and from  here the enemy was eventually routed by the smart action of the  besieged.    During the night the Colonel ordered Captain Fitzclarence, with D  squadron and a Hotchkiss gun, to relieve Lord C. Bentinck and to support  the \"snipers\" in the river-bed. D squadron took up a position in the  river-bed under Captain Fitzclarence and Lieutenant Bridges 1400 yards  from \"Big Ben.\" The Cape Police and a Maxim at the extreme south-east  corner, and Captain Marsh with a detachment of the Cape Police in the  native stadt at 2000 yards range, co-operated. It now became impossible  for the Boer artillerists to hold the emplacement of their 100-lb. gun.  Heavy three-cornered volleying from the British positions swept the  parapet of \"Big Ben\" every time its detachment attempted to turn the gun  upon the town. The remarkable accuracy of our fire kept the Boer gunners  at bay, and after discharging two shells they withdrew the weapon below  its platform. The enemy made some futile efforts to renew the shelling,  but at last desisted. But on the morrow the customary salute of big guns  was resumed. Meanwhile the Colonel employed himself with various jokes  of a very practical nature, which served to keep the wits and energies  of the Boers in a perpetual state of polish.    News from Colonel Plumer and his force was scarce, but all were aware  that their days and nights were spent in hard work, great discomfort,  and in perpetual and gallant efforts to come to the aid of the besieged  town. It must be remembered that the Rhodesian Regiment originally had  for its object the protection of the northern border of the Transvaal  and a portion of the western side. Mafeking made, as it were, the outer  gate, and this gate it was necessary to defend in order to preserve the  communications with the north and with Buluwayo. No sooner, therefore,  was it locked by a state of siege, than the entire responsibility of  keeping the Boers at bay in the northern fringe of the Transvaal  devolved on Colonel Plumer, who, on arrival at Tuli, set to work to  guard the Drifts, and keep an eye on all quarters along the Crocodile  where the Boers might try to effect a crossing. At Rhodes Drift,  twenty-six miles south of South Tuli, he posted Major Pilsen with 250  mounted infantry, while Captain Maclaren, with fifty men of the Rhodesia  Regiment and twenty of the Bechuanaland Border Police, was sent to  garrison Macloutsie, some thirty miles north of the Limpopo, where it  was said the Boers hoped to put in an appearance. Major Pilsen, as we  know, was forced to retire on Tuli, after which the position vacated by  him was occupied by Colonel Spreckley (Southern Rhodesia Volunteers),  who in his turn was obliged to make a night march back to Tuli, with the  loss of all his horses. Soon after this, strong Boer patrols approached  daily towards Tuli, and the garrison had an anxious and energetic time.  Minor skirmishes took place with certain success, but leaving behind  them their melancholy roll of killed and wounded. Soon, however, a  British victory south, and Colonel Plumer's exertions round about,  combined to alter the Boer plans, and at length their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#11)"],[1," 1845, studied with  Chopin and Liszt in Paris in 1842-43, and created a sensation  with his concerts both there and in London, Vienna, and Italy.  According to Lenz, Liszt said of him, \"When the youngster goes  travelling I shall shut up shop!\"]    Compiegne, Wednesday Morning [1842 or 1843].    Dearly beloved conjurer,    How sorry I am to disappoint [Literally. \"to make a false skip,\"  a play-of-words with the next sentence.] you of our usual lesson  tomorrow! Your \"false skips\" would be a great deal pleasanter to  me! but, unless we could manage to put you where we could hear  you from the towers of Notre Dame to the Cathedral of Cologne,  there is a material impossibility in continuing our sort of  lessons, considering that by tomorrow evening I shall already be  at Cologne.    If I return, or when I return--I really don't know. Whatever  happens, keep a little corner of remembrance of me, and believe  me ever yours affectionately,    F. Liszt    Affectionate remembrances to your brother Joseph. Farewell again.  I embrace you affectionately.        37. To Franz von Schober in Paris    Berlin, March 4th, 1844    You are a dear, faithful friend, and I thank you with all my  heart for your kind letter. God reward you for your love to such  a jaded, worn-out creature as I am! I can only assure you that I  feel it deeply and gratefully, and that your words soothe many  spasmodic annoyances.    At the end of this month we shall certainly see each other in  Paris. Villers [Alexander von Villers, a friend of Liszt's,  attache of the Saxon Embassy in Vienna.] is coming also. In case  Seydlitz is still there make my excuses to him, and tell him  that, owing to my delay at Dresden, I only got his letter  yesterday. I will answer him immediately, and will address to  Lefebre, as he tells me to do. I have had several conferences  with the H[ereditary] G[rand] D[uke] and Eckermann. [The editor  of Goethe's \"Gesprachen\"] Our business seems to me to stand on a  firm footing. Next autumn the knots will be ready to tie. [Refers  probably to Schober's subsequent appointment at Weimar.]    My room is too full. I have got a tremendous fit of Byron on. Be  indulgent and kind as ever!    Remember me to the Sabatiers, and stick to me! Yours most  affectionately,    F. Liszt        38. To Franz Kroll    [Pupil and friend of Liszt's (1820-1877); since 1849 settled in  Berlin as a pianoforte teacher; rendered great service by his  edition of Bach's \"Das wohltemperirte Clavier.\"]    My dear good Kroll,    What a first-rate man you are to me, and what pleasure your  letter has given me! Probably you already know that I also have  been figuring as an invalid these last five weeks.--God be  thanked and praised that I am already pretty fairly on my legs  again, without rheumatism in the joints or gout! In a few days I  shall begin my provincial tour (Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse,  Bordeaux), and then towards the end of August by steamer to  Stockholm and Copenhagen. Weymar, our good, dear Weymar, will  again be our Christmas Day! Oh what beautiful apples and trifles  we will hang on our Christmas tree! and what talks and  compositions, and projects and plans! Only don't you disappoint  me, and mind you come fresh and well. Leave the bad looks to me,  and see that you fill out your cheeks properly. This winter  we  must be industrious, and struggle through much work.    Your Mazurkas are most excellent and talented. You have put a  great deal into them--and, if you will allow me to speak quite  freely--perhaps too much into them, for much of it halts.  Although the dedication to me is both pleasing and gratifying, I  cannot help thinking that it would be to your interest not to  publish anything before next spring. Take advantage of being as  yet unknown, and give to the public from the beginning a proper  opinion of your talent by a collective publication. Write a  couple of pleasing, brilliant Studies--perhaps also a Notturno  (or something of that sort), and an effective Fantasia on some  conspicuous theme. Then let Schlesinger, Hartel, or Mechetti (to  whom I will most gladly speak about your works beforehand)  publish the six pieces--your Concerto and the C major Study,  together with the later pieces--all together, so that publisher,  critic, artist, and public all have to do with them at the same  time. Instead of dishing up one little sweetmeat for the people,  give them a proper dinner. I am very sorry I did not follow this  plan myself; for, after much experience, I consider it far the  best, especially for pianoforte works. In Weymar we will talk  more fully and definitely about this. Conradi [Musician and  friend in Berlin] is also to come. I don't require the Huguenot  Fantasia at present. He will have time enough for it in Weymar.  En attendant, [A German letter, so Liszt's own French expression  is kept] Schlesinger will give him a modest payment for the work  he has begun. Please kindly see about the enclosed letters for  Freund as soon as possible.    With all good wishes, I am, dear Kroll,    Yours most sincerely,    F. Liszt    Port Marly, June 11th, 1844        39. To Freund    [Autograph in the possession of Professor Hermann Scholtz in  Dresden.]    I am shockingly behindhand with you, my dear Freund, but I won't  make any excuses, although an illness of more than a month comes  rather a propos to justify me fully and even more.    Herewith letters and cards for Baron Lannoy (Haslinger will give  you the address), for Prince Fritz Schwarzenberg, and for Doctor  Uwe, Kriehuber, and Simon Lowy, who will soon be back in Vienna.  I shall be glad if you will give them in any case, whether now or  later. If you want to give me a pleasure you will go and see my  uncle Eduard Liszt, and try to distract him a little.    I detest repeating myself in letters so much that I can't write  over again to you my plans of travel up to the beginning of  winter; these I have just told Kroll in full, and you already  know them from Hanover.    Teleky, Bethlen (Friends of Liszt's), and Corracioni are here,  and form a kind of colony which I call the Tribe of the Huns!    Probably Teleky will come and pick me up at Weymar towards the  middle of February, and we shall go together to Vienna and Pest--  not forgetting Temesvar, Debreczin, and Klausenburg!    I hope then to find you in Vienna, and shall perhaps be able to  give you a good lift.    Meanwhile acknowledge the receipt of these lines: enjoy yourself,  and remain to me always friend Freund. [A play on his name  Freund, which means friend.]    Yours most sincerely and affectionately,    F. Liszt    Port Marly, June 11th, 1844.        40. To Franz Von Schober.    Gibraltar, March 3rd, 1845.    Your letter pleases me like a child, my dear good Schober!  Everything comes to him who can wait. But I scarcely can wait to  congratulate you and to see you again in Weymar [as Councillor of  Legation there]. Unhappily it is not probable that I can get  there before the end of next autumn. Keep me in your good books,  therefore, until then, and accept my best thanks in advance for  all you will have done for me and fought for me till then, both  in Weymar and in Hungary!    With regard to Vienna, Lowy writes me almost exactly the same as  you. To tell the truth I am extremely thankful to the Vienna  public, for it was they who, in a critically apathetic moment,  roused and raised me [When he came from Venice to Vienna in the  spring of 1838, to give a concert for the benefit of his  Hungarian compatriots after the inundations, on which occasion,  although Thalberg, Clara Wieck, and Henselt had been there before  him, he aroused the utmost enthusiasm.]; but still I don't feel  the slightest obligation to return there a year sooner or later.  My Vienna journey will pretty much mark the end of my virtuoso  career. I hope to go thence (in the month of August, 1846) to  Constantinople, and on my return to Italy to pass my dramatic  Rubicon or Fiasco.    So much for my settled plans.    What precisely is going to become of me this coming spring and  summer I do not exactly know. In any case to Paris I will not go.  You know why. My incredibly wretched connection with _____ has  perhaps indirectly contributed more than anything to my Spanish-  Portuguese tour. I have no reason to regret having come, although  my best friends tried to dissuade me from it. Sometimes it seems  to me that my thoughts ripen and that my troubles grow  prematurely old under the bright and penetrating sun of Spain...    Many kind messages to Eckermann and Wolff. [Professor Wolff,  editor of \"Der poetische Hausschatz.\"] I will write to the latter  from the Rhine, where I shall at any rate spend a month this  summer (perhaps with my mother and Cosima). If he is still  inclined to return to his and your countries (Denmark and  Sweden), we can make a nice little trip there as a holiday treat.    Good-bye, my dear excellent friend. Allow me to give you as true  a love as I feel is a necessity of my heart! Ever yours,    F. Liszt    What is Villers doing? If you see him tell him to write me a line  to Marseilles, care of M. Boisselot, Pianoforte Maker.        41. To Franz Kroll at Glogau    Weymar, March 26th, 1845    My very dear Kroll,    The arrival of your letter and the packet which accompanied it  decided a matter of warm contest between our friend Lupus  [Presumably Liszt's friend, Professor Wolff (1791-1851).] and  Farfa-Magne-quint-quatorze! [For whom this name was intended is  not clear.] It consisted in making the latter see the difference  between the two German verbs \"verwundern\" (to amaze) and  \"bewundern\" (to admire), and to translate clearly, according to  her wits, which are sometimes so ingeniously refractory, what  progress there is from Verwundern (amazement) to Erstaunen  (astonishment). Imagine, now, with what a wonderful solution of  the difficulty your packet and letter furnished us, and how  pleased I was "]]]
