The Heash are clouds like the plains and behind these the  Cloud People are laboring to water the earth. Water is brought by the  Cloud People, from the springs at the base of the mountains, in gourds  and jugs and vases by the men, women, and children. They rise from the  springs and pass through the trunk of the tree to its top, which reaches  Tinia. They pass on to the point to be sprinkled.    The priest of the Cloud People is above even the priests of the Thunder,  Lightning, and Rainbow Peoples. The Cloud People have ceremonials, just  like those of the Sia. On the altars of the Sia may be seen figures  arranged just as the Cloud People sit in their ceremonials.    When a priest of the Cloud People wishes assistance from the Thunder and  Lightning Peoples, he notifies their priests, but keeps a supervision of  all things himself.    Then the Lightning People shoot their arrows to make it rain the harder.  The smaller flashes come from the bows of the children. The Thunder  People have human forms, with wings of knives, and by flapping these  wings they make a great noise. Thus they frighten the Cloud and  Lightning People into working the harder.    The Rainbow People were created to work in Tinia to make it more  beautiful for the people of Ha-arts, the earth, to look upon. The elders  make the beautiful rainbows, but the children assist. The Sia have no  idea of what or how these bows are made. They do know, however, that war  heroes always travel upon the rainbows.    (5) The Indians say the Americans also ride wheels, therefore they must  have known about the Cloud People.          Rain Song  Sia (New Mexico)    We, the ancient ones, ascended from the middle of the world below,  through the door of the entrance to the lower world, we hold our songs  to the Cloud, Lightning, and Thunder Peoples as we hold our own hearts.  Our medicine is precious.    (Addressing the people of Tinia:)    We entreat you to send your thoughts to us so that we may sing your  songs straight, so that they will pass over the straight road to the  Cloud priests that they may cover the earth with water, so that she may  bear all that is good for us.    Lightning People, send your arrows to the middle of the earth. Hear the  echo! Who is it? The People of the Spruce of the North. All your people  and your thoughts come to us. Who is it? People of the white floating  Clouds. Your thoughts come to us. All your people and your thoughts come  to us. Who is it? The Lightning People. Your thoughts come to us. Who is  it? Cloud People at the horizon. All your people and your thoughts come  to us.          Rain Song    White floating clouds. Clouds, like the plains, come and water the  earth. Sun, embrace the earth that she may be fruitful. Moon, lion of  the north, bear of the west, badger of the south, wolf of the east,  eagle of the heavens, shrew of the earth, elder war hero, younger war  hero, warriors of the six mountains of the world, intercede with the  Cloud People for us that they may water the earth. Medicine bowl, cloud  bowl, and water vase give us your hearts, that the earth may be watered.  I make the ancient road of meal that my song may pass straight over it--  the ancient road. White shell bead woman who lives where the sun goes  down, mother whirlwind, father Sussistinnako, mother Yaya, creator of  good thoughts, yellow woman of the north, blue woman of the west, red  woman of the south, white woman of the east, slightly yellow woman of  the zenith, and dark woman of the nadir, I ask your intercession with  the Cloud People.          Rain Song  Sia (New Mexico)    Let the white floating clouds--the clouds like the plains--the  lightning, thunder, rainbow, and cloud peoples, water the earth. Let the  people of the white floating clouds,--the people of the clouds like the  plains--the lightning, thunder, rain bow, and cloud peoples--come and  work for us, and water the earth.          The Corn Maidens  Zuni (New Mexico)    After long ages of wandering, the precious Seed-things rested over the  Middle at Zuni, and men turned their hearts to the cherishing of their  corn and the Corn Maidens instead of warring with strange men.    But there was complaint by the people of the customs followed. Some said  the music was not that of the olden time. Far better was that which of  nights they often heard as they wandered up and down the river trail.  (6) Wonderful music, as of liquid voices in caverns, or the echo of  women's laughter in water-vases. And the music was timed with a  deep-toned drum from the Mountain of Thunder. Others thought the music  was that of the ghosts of ancient men, but it was far more beautiful  than the music when danced the Corn Maidens. Others said light clouds  rolled upward from the grotto in Thunder Mountain like to the mists that  leave behind them the dew, but lo! even as they faded the bright  garments of the Rainbow women might be seen fluttering, and the broidery  and paintings of these dancers of the mist were more beautiful than the  costumes of the Corn Maidens.    Then the priests of the people said, \"It may well be Paiyatuma, the  liquid voices his flute and the flutes of his players.\"    Now when the time of ripening corn was near, the fathers ordered  preparation for the dance of the Corn Maidens. They sent the two  Master-Priests of the Bow to the grotto at Thunder Mountains, saying,    \"If you behold Paiyatuma, and his maidens, perhaps they will give us the  help of their customs.\"    Then up the river trail, the priests heard the sound of a drum and  strains of song. It was Paiyatuma and his seven maidens, the Maidens of  the House of Stars, sisters of the Corn Maidens.    The God of Dawn and Music lifted his flute and took his place in the  line of dancers. The drum sounded until the cavern shook as with  thunder. The flutes sang and sighed as the wind in a wooded canon while  still the storm is distant. White mists floated up from the wands of the  Maidens, above which fluttered the butterflies of Summer-land about the  dress of the Rainbows in the strange blue light of the night.    Then Paiyatuma, smiling, said, \"Go the way before, telling the fathers  of our custom, and straightway we will follow.\"    Soon the sound of music was heard, coming from up the river, and soon  the Flute People and singers and maidens of the Flute dance. Up rose the  fathers and all the watching people, greeting the God of Dawn with  outstretched hand and offering of prayer meal. Then the singers took  their places and sounded their drum, flutes, and song of clear waters,  while the Maidens of the Dew danced their Flute dance. Greatly marvelled  the people, when from the wands they bore forth came white clouds, and  fine cool mists descended.    Now when the dance was ended and the Dew Maidens had retired, out came  the beautiful Mothers of Corn. And when the players of the flutes saw  them, they were enamoured of their beauty and gazed upon them so  intently that the Maidens let fall their hair and cast down their eyes.  And jealous and bolder grew the mortal youths, and in the morning dawn,  in rivalry, the dancers sought all too freely the presence of the Corn  Maidens, no longer holding them so precious as in the olden time. And  the matrons, intent on the new dance, heeded naught else. But behold!  The mists increased greatly, surrounding dancers and watchers alike,  until within them, the Maidens of Corn, all in white garments, became  invisible. Then sadly and noiselessly they stole in amongst the people  and laid their corn wands down amongst the trays, and laid their white  broidered garments thereupon, as mothers lay soft kilting over their  babes. Then even as the mists became they, and with the mists drifting,  fled away, to the far south Summer-land.    (6) The mists and the dawn breeze on the river and in the grotto.          The Search for the Corn Maidens  Zuni (New Mexico)    Then the people in their trouble called the two Master-Priests and said:  \"Who, now, think ye, should journey to seek our precious Maidens?  Bethink ye! Who amongst the Beings is even as ye are, strong of will and  good of eyes? There is our great elder brother and father, Eagle, he of  the floating down and of the terraced tail-fan. Surely he is enduring of  will and surpassing of sight.\"    \"Yea. Most surely,\" said the fathers. \"Go ye forth and beseech him.\"    Then the two sped north to Twin Mountain, where in a grotto high up  among the crags, with his mate and his young, dwelt the Eagle of the  White Bonnet.    They climbed the mountain, but behold! Only the eaglets were there. They  screamed lustily and tried to hide themselves in the dark recesses.  \"Pull not our feathers, ye of hurtful touch, but wait. When we are older  we will drop them for you even from the clouds.\"    \"Hush,\" said the warriors. \"Wait in peace. We seek not ye but thy  father.\"    Then from afar, with a frown, came old Eagle. \"Why disturb ye my  featherlings?\" he cried.    \"Behold! Father and elder brother, we come seeking only the light of thy  favor. Listen!\"    Then they told him of the lost Maidens of the Corn, and begged him to  search for them.    \"Be it well with thy wishes,\" said Eagle. \"Go ye before contentedly.\"    So the warriors returned to the council. But Eagle winged his way high  into the sky. High, high, he rose, until he circled among the clouds,  small-seeming and swift, like seed-down in a whirlwind. Through all the  heights, to the north, to the west, to the south, and to the east, he  circled and sailed. Yet nowhere saw he trace of the Corn Maidens. Then  he flew lower, returning. Before the warriors were rested, people heard  the roar of his wings. As he alighted, the fathers said, \"Enter thou and  sit, oh brother, and say to us what thou hast to say.\" And they offered  him the cigarette of the space relations.    When they had puffed the smoke toward the four points of the compass,  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#11)"],[1,"we held our own,  and fired on the soldiers at 50 paces. The English, however, directed  an uninterrupted gun fire at our commandos, and wrought great havoc.  Early Sunday morning the other side asked for a truce to enable them  to bury their dead who were lying too close to our positions to be got  at during the fighting. Many of their wounded were lying there as  well, and the air was rent during 24 hours with their agonised groans,  which were awful to hear. We, therefore, granted an armistice till 6  o'clock in the evening.\" (This curiously coincided in time with Lord  Roberts' refusal to General Piet Cronje at Paardeberg to bury his  dead).    \"The enemy,\" continued the field-cornet, \"broke through several  positions, and while we were being fired at by the troops which were  advancing on us, we were attacked on our left flank and in the rear.  Assistant-Commandant Du Preez, and Field-Cornet Mostert, were both  severely wounded, but are now in safe hands. Besides these, 42 of our  burghers were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners; we could only bring  16 of our wounded with us. The Krugersdorpers, too, have suffered  severely. The enemy has pushed through, and I suppose my burghers are  now taking up a position in the \"randten\" near Onderbroekspruit.\"    Here was a nice state of things! When I had left my commando 15 days  previously, we had had heavy losses in the battle of Vaalkrantz, and  now again my burghers had been badly cut up. We had lost over 100 men  in one month.    But there was no time to lose in lamenting over these matters, for I  had just received information that General P. Cronje had been taken  prisoner with 4,000 men. The next report was to the effect that the  enemy was breaking through near Onderbroekspruit, and that some  burghers were retiring past Ladysmith. I was still in telegraphic  communication with the head laager, and at once wired to the  Commandant-General for instructions. The answer was:--         \"Send your carts back to Modderspruit (our headquarters) and       hold the position with your mounted commandos.\"    The position indicated was on the Upper Tugela, on a line with  Colenso. My laager was about 20 miles away from the head laager; the  enemy had passed through Onderbroekspruit, and was pushing on with all  possible speed to relieve Ladysmith, so that I now stood in an oblique  line with the enemy's rear. I sent out my carts to the south-west,  going round Ladysmith in the direction of Modderspruit. One of my  scouts reported to me that the Free State commandos which had been  besieging Ladysmith to the south, had all gone in the direction of Van  Reenen's Pass; another brought the information that the enemy had been  seen to approach the village, and that a great force of cavalry was  making straight for us.    General Joubert's instructions were therefore inexplicable to me, and  if I had carried them out I would probably have been cut off by the  enemy. My burghers were also getting restless, and asked me why, while  all the other commandos were retiring, we did not move. Cronje's  surrender had had a most disheartening effect on them; there was, in  fact, quite a panic among them. I mounted a high kopje from which I  could see the whole Orange Free State army, followed by a long line of  quite 500 carts and a lot of cattle, in full retreat, and enveloped in  great clouds of red dust. To the right of Ladysmith I also noticed a  similar melancholy procession. On turning round, I saw the English in  vast numbers approaching very cautiously, so slowly, in fact, that it  would take some time before they could reach us. Another and great  force was rushing up behind them, also in the direction of Ladysmith.    It must have been a race for the Distinguished Service Order or the  Victoria Cross to be won by the one who was first to enter Ladysmith.  We knew that the British infantry, aided by the artillery, had paved  the way for relief, and I noticed the Irish Fusiliers on this  occasion, as always, in the van. But Lord Dundonald rushed in and was  proclaimed the hero of the occasion.    Before concluding this chapter I should like to refer to a few  incidents which happened during the Siege of Ladysmith. It is  unnecessary to give a detailed description of the destruction of \"Long  Tom\" at Lombardskop or the blowing up of another gun west of  Ladysmith, belonging to the Pretoria Commando. The other side have  written enough about this, and made enough capital out of them; and  many a D.S.O. and V.C. has been awarded on account of them.    Alas, I can put forward nothing to lessen our dishonour. As regards  the \"Long Tom\" which was blown up, this was a piece of pure treachery,  and a shocking piece of neglect, Commandant Weilbach, who ought to  have defended this gun with the whole of his Heidelberg Commando, was  unfaithful to his charge. The Heidelbergers, however, under a better  officer, subsequently proved themselves excellent soldiers. A certain  Major Erasmus was also to blame. He was continually under the  influence of some beverage which could not be described as \"aqua  pura\"; and we, therefore, expected little from him. But although the  planning and the execution of the scheme to blow up \"Long Tom\" was a  clever piece of work, the British wasted time and opportunity amusing  themselves in cutting out on the gun the letters \"R.A.\" (Royal  Artillery), and the effect of the explosion was only to injure part of  the barrel. After a little operation in the workshops of the  Netherlands South African Railway Company at Pretoria under the  direction of Mr. Uggla, our gun-doctor, \"Long Tom's\" mouth was healed  and he could spit fire again as well as before. As to the blowing up  of the howitzer shortly after, I will say the incident reflected no  credit on General Erasmus, as he ought to have been warned by what  happened near Lombardskop, and to have taken proper precautions not to  give a group of starving and suffering soldiers an opportunity of  penetrating his lines and advancing right up to his guns.    Both incidents will be an ugly blot on the history of this war, and I  am sorry to say the two Boer officers have never received condign  punishment. They should, at any rate, have been called before the  Commandant-General to explain their conduct.    The storming of Platrand (Caesar's Camp), south-east of Ladysmith, on  the 6th of January, 1900, also turned out badly for many reasons. The  attack was not properly conducted owing to a jealousy amongst some of  the generals, and there was not proper co-operation.    The burghers who took part in the assault and captured several forts  did some splendid work, which they might well be proud of, but they  were not seconded as they should have been. The enemy knew that if  they lost Platrand, Ladysmith would have to surrender; they therefore  defended every inch of ground, with the result that our men were  finally compelled to give way. And, for our pains, we sustained an  enormous loss in men, which did not improve in any way the broken  spirit of our burghers.          CHAPTER XII.    THE GREAT BOER RETREAT.      There was clearly no help for it, we had to retreat. I gave orders to  saddle up and to follow the example of the other commandos, reporting  the fact to the Commandant-General. An answer came--not from  Modderspruit this time, but from the station beyond Elandslaagte--that  a general retreat had been ordered, most of the commandos having  already passed Ladysmith, and that General Joubert had gone in advance  to Glencoe. At dusk I left the Tugela positions which we had so  successfully held for a considerable time, where we had arrested the  enemy from marching to the relief of Ladysmith, and where so many  comrades had sacrificed their lives for their country and their  people.    It was a sad sight to see the commandos retreating in utter chaos and  disorder in all directions. I asked many officers what instructions  they had received, but nobody seemed to know what the orders actually  were; their only idea seemed to be to get away as quickly as possible.    Finally, at 9 o'clock in the evening we reached Klip River, where a  strange scene was taking place. The banks were crowded with hundreds  of mounted men, carts and cattle mingled in utter confusion amongst  the guns, all awaiting their turn to cross. With an infinite amount of  trouble the carts were all got over one at a time. After a few  minutes' rest I decided on consulting my officers, that we should  cross the river with our men by another drift further up the stream,  our example being followed by a number of other commandos.    I should point out here that in retreating we were going to the left,  and therefore in perilous proximity to Ladysmith. The commandos which  had been investing the town were all gone; and Buller's troops had  already reached it from the eastern side, and there was really  nothing to prevent the enemy from turning our rear, which had perforce  to pass Ladysmith on its way from the Tugela. When we had finally got  through the drift late that evening, a rumour reached us that the  British were in possession of Modderspruit, and so far as that road  was concerned, our retreat was effectually cut off.    Shortly before the War, however, the English had made a new road which  followed the course of the Klip River up to the Drakensbergen, and  then led through the Biggarsbergen to Newcastle. This road was, I  believe, made for military purposes; but it was very useful to us, and  our wagons were safely got away by it.    Commandant D. Joubert, of the Carolina Commando, then sent a message  asking for reinforcements for the Pretoria laager, situated to the  north-west of Ladysmith. It was a dark night and the rain was pouring  down in torrents, which rendered it very difficult to get the  necessary burghers together for this purpose.    I managed, however, to induce a sufficient number of men to come  together,"]]]
