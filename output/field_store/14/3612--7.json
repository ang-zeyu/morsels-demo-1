Its flowers  are in catkins, as with the rest of the family, and, like other poplars,  they are in two kinds, male and female, or staminate and pistillate,  which accounts for some troubles the inexperienced investigator has in  locating them.    There is another aspen, the large-toothed form, that is a distinct  botanical species; but I have never been able to separate it, wherefore  I do not try to tell of it here, lest I fall under condemnation as a  blind leader, not of the blind, but of those who would see!    In many cities, especially in cities that have experienced real-estate  booms, and have had \"extensions\" laid out \"complete with all  improvements,\" there is to be seen a poplar that has the merit of quick  and pleasing growth and considerable elegance as well. Alas, it is like  the children of the tropics in quick beauty and quick decadence! The  Carolina poplar, it is called, being a variety of the wide-spread  cottonwood. Grow? All that is needed is to cut a lusty branch of it,  point it, and drive it into the earth--it will do the rest!    This means cheap trees and quick growth, and that is why whole new  streets in West Philadelphia, for instance, are given up to the Carolina  poplar. Its clear, green, shining leaves, of good size, coming early in  spring; its easily guided habit, either upright or spreading; its very  rapid growth, all commend it. But its coarseness and lack of real  strength, and its continual invitation to the tree-butcher and the  electric lineman, indicate the undesirability of giving it more than a  temporary position, to shade while better trees are growing.    [Illustration: The Carolina poplar as a street tree]    But I must not get into the economics of street-tree planting. I started  to tell of the blossoms of this same Carolina poplar, which are  decidedly interesting. Just when the sun has thoroughly warmed up the  air of spring there is a sudden, rapid thickening of buds over one's  head on this poplar. One year the tree under my observation swelled and  swelled its buds, which were shining more and more in the sun, until I  was sure the next day would bring a burst of leaves. But the weather was  dry, and it was not until that wonderful solvent and accelerator of  growing things, a warm spring rain, fell softly upon the tree, that the  pent-up life force was given vent. Then came, not leaves, but these long  catkins, springing out with great rapidity, until in a few hours the  tree glowed with their redness. A second edition of the shower, falling  sharply, brought many of the catkins to the ground, where they lay about  like large caterpillars.    The whole process of this blooming was interesting, curious, but hardly  beautiful, and it seemed to fit in with the restless character of the  poplar family--a family of trees with more vigor than dignity, more  sprightliness than grace. As Professor Bailey says of the cottonwood,  \"It is cheerful and restive. One is not moved to lie under it as he is  under a maple or an oak.\" Yet there are not wanting some poplars of  impressive character.    One occurs to me, growing on a wide street of my home town, opposite a  church with a graceful spire. This white or silver-leaved poplar has for  many years been a regular prey of the gang of tree-trimmers, utterly  without knowledge of or regard for trees, that infests this town. They  hack it shamefully, and I look at it and say, \"Well, the old poplar is  ruined now, surely!\" But a season passes, and I look again, to see that  the tremendous vigor of the tree has triumphed over the butchers; its  sores have been concealed, new limbs have pushed out, and it has again,  in its unusual height, assumed a dignity not a whit inferior to that of  the church spire opposite.    [Illustration: Winter aspect of the cottonwood tree]    This white poplar is at its best on the bank of a stream, where its  small forest of \"suckers\" most efficiently protects the slope against  the destructive action of floods. One such tree with its family and  friends I saw in full bloom along the Susquehanna, and it gave an  impression of solidity and size, as well as of lusty vigor, and I have  always liked it since. The cheerful bark is not the least of its  attractions--but it is a tree for its own place, and not for every  place, by reason of the tremendous colonizing power of its root-sprouts.    I wonder, by the way, if many realize the persistence and vigor of the  roots of a tree of the \"suckering\" habit? Some years ago an ailanthus, a  tree of vigor and beauty of foliage but nastiness of flower odor, was  cut away from its home when excavation was being made for a building,  which gave me opportunity to follow a few of its roots. One of them  traveled in search of food, and toward the opportunity of sending up a  shoot, over a hundred feet!    The impending scarcity of spruce logs to feed the hungry maws of the  machines that make paper for our daily journals has turned attention to  several forms of the rapid-growing poplar for this use. The aspen is  acceptable, and also the Carolina poplar, and these trees are being  planted in large quantities for the eventual making of wood-pulp. Even  today, many newspapers are printed on poplar, and exposure to the rays  of the truth-searching sun for a few hours will disclose the yellowness  of the paper, if not of the tree from which it has been ground.    [Illustration: Lombardy poplar]    Few whose eyes are turned upward toward the trees have failed to note  that exclamation-point of growth, the Lombardy poplar. Originating in  that portion of Europe indicated by its common name, and, indeed, a  botanical form of the European black poplar, it is nevertheless widely  distributed in America. When it has been properly placed, it introduces  truly a note of distinction into the landscape. Towering high in the  air, and carrying the eye along its narrowly oval contour to a skyward  point, it is lofty and pleasing in a park. It agreeably breaks the  sky-line in many places, and is emphatic in dignified groups. To plant  it in rows is wrong; and I say this as an innocent offender myself. In  boyhood I lived along the banks of the broad but shallow Susquehanna,  and enjoyed the boating possible upon that stream when it was not  reduced, as graphically described by a disgusted riverman, to merely a  heavy dew. Many times I lost my way returning to the steep bluff near my  home after the sun had gone to rest, and a hard pull against the swift  current would ensue as I skirted the bank, straining eyes for landmarks  in the dusk. It occurred to me to plant six Lombardy poplars on the top  of the bluff, which might serve as easily recognized landmarks. Four of  them grew, and are now large trees, somewhat offensive to a quickened  sense of appropriateness. Long since the old home has been swallowed up  by the city's advance, and I suppose none who now see those four spires  of green on the river-bank even guess at the reason for their existence.    The poplar family, as a whole, is exuberant with vigor, and interesting  more on that account than by reason of its general dignity or strength  or elegance. It is well worth a little attention and study, and the  consideration particularly of its bloom periods, to which I commend the  tree-sense of my readers as they take the tree walks that ought to  punctuate these chapters.          The Elm and the Tulip      America has much that is unique in plant and tree growth, as one learns  who sees first the collections of American plants shown with pride by  acute gardeners and estate owners in England and on the European  Continent. Many a citizen of our country must needs confess with some  shame that his first estimation of the singular beauty of the American  laurel has been born in England, where the imported plants are carefully  nurtured; and the European to whom the rhododendrons of his own country  and of the Himalayas are familiar is ready to exclaim in rapture at the  superb effect and tropical richness of our American species, far more  lusty and more truly beautiful here than the introductions which must be  heavily paid for and constantly coddled.    For no trees, however, may Americans feel more pride than for our  American elms and our no less American tulip, the latter miscalled  tulip \"poplar.\" Both are trees practically unique to the country, both  are widespread over Eastern North America, both are thoroughly trees of  the people, both attain majestic proportions, both are long-lived and  able to endure much hardship without a full giving up of either beauty  or dignity.    The American elm--how shall I properly speak of its exceeding grace and  beauty! In any landscape it introduces an element of distinction and  elegance not given by any other tree. Looking across a field at a  cluster of trees, there may be a doubt as to the identity of an oak, a  chestnut, a maple, an ash, but no mistake can be made in regard to an  elm--it stands alone in the simple elegance of its vase-like form, while  its feathery branchlets, waving in the lightest breeze, add to the  refined and classic effect. I use the word \"classic\" advisedly, because,  although apparently out of place in describing a tree, it nevertheless  seems needed for the form of the American elm.    The elm is never rugged as is the oak, but it gives no impression of  effeminacy or weakness. Its uprightness is forceful and strong, and its  clean and shapely bole impresses the beholder as a joining of gently  outcurving columns, ample in strength and of an elegance belonging to  itself alone. If I may dare to compare man-made architectural forms with  the trees that graced the garden of Eden, I would liken the American elm  (it is also the water elm and the white elm, and botanically _Ulmus  Americana_) to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#11)"],[1,"his weight in  gold paid to the sanctuary were considered an atonement for him.  (57) In the same war Saul had occasion to show his zeal for the  scrupulous observance of the sacrificial ordinances. He reproached  his warriors with eating the meat of the sacrifices before the blood  was sprinkled on the altar, (58) and he made it his task to see to it  that the slaughtering knife was kept in the prescribed condition. As  recompense, an angel brought him a sword, there being none  beside Saul in the whole army to bear one. (59)    Saul manifested a different spirit in the next campaign, the war  with the Amalekites, whom, at the bidding of God, he was to  exterminate. When the message of God's displeasure was conveyed  to Saul by the prophet Samuel, he said: \"If the Torah ordains that a  heifer of the herd shall be beheaded in the valley as an atonement  for the death of a single man, how great must be the atonement  required for the slaughter of so many men? And granted they are  sinners, what wrong have their cattle done to deserve annihilation?  And granted that the adults are worthy of their fate, what have the  children done?\" Then a voice proclaimed from heaven, \"Be not  overjust.\" Later on, when Saul commissioned Doeg to cut down  the priests at Nob, the same voice was heard to say, \"Be not  overwicked.\" (60) It was this very Doeg, destined to play so baleful  a part in his life, who induced Saul to spare Agag, the king of  Amalekites. His argument was the law prohibits the slaying of an  animal and its young on the same day. How much less permissible  is it to destroy at one time old and young, men and children. (61)  As Saul had undertaken the war of extermination against Amalek  only because forced into it, he was easily persuaded to let the  people keep a part of the cattle alive. As far as he himself was  concerned, he could have had no personal interest in the booty, for  he was so affluent that he took a census of the army by giving a  sheep to every one of his soldiers, distributing not less than two  hundred thousand sheep. (62)    Compared with David's sins, Saul's were not sufficiently grievous  to account for the withdrawal of the royal dignity from him and his  family. The real reason was Saul's too great mildness, a drawback  in a ruler. Moreover, his family was of such immaculate nobility  that his descendants might have become too haughty. (63) When  Saul disregarded the Divine command about the Amalekites,  Samuel announced to him that his office would be bestowed upon  another. The name of his successor was not mentioned on that  occasion, but Samuel gave him a sign by which to recognize the  future king: he who would cut off the corner of Saul's mantle,  would reign in his stead. Later on, when David met Saul in the  cave and cut off a piece of the king's skirt, Saul knew him for a  certainty to be his destined successor. (64)    So Saul lost his crown on account of Agag, and yet did not  accomplish his purpose of saving the life of the Amalekite king,  for Samuel inflicted a most cruel death upon Agag, and that not in  accordance with Jewish, but with heathen, forms of justice. No  witnesses of Agag's crime could be summoned before the court,  nor could it be proved that Agag, as the law requires, had been  warned when about to commit the crime. (65) Though due  punishment was meted out to Agag, in a sense it came too late.  Had he been killed by Saul in the course of the battle, the Jews  would have been spared the persecution devised by Haman, for, in  the short span of time that elapsed between war and his execution,  Agag became the ancestor of Haman. (66)    The Amalekite war was the last of Saul's notable achievements.  Shortly afterward he was seized by the evil spirit, and the rest of  his days were passed mainly in persecuting David and his  followers. Saul would have died immediately after the Amalekite  war, if Samuel had not interceded for him. The prophet prayed to  God that the life of the disobedient king be spared, at least so long  as his own years had not come to their destined close: \"Thou  regardest me equal to Moses and Aaron. (67) As Moses and Aaron  did not have their handiwork destroyed before their eyes during  their life, so may my handiwork not cease during my life.\" God  said: \"What shall I do? Samuel will not let me put an end to Saul's  days, and if I let Samuel die in his prime, people will speak ill of  him (68) Meanwhile David's time is approaching, and one reign  may not overlap the time assigned to another by his hairbreadth.\"  God determined to let Samuel age suddenly, and when he died at  fifty-two, (69) the people were under the impression the days of an  old man had come to an end. So long as he lived, Saul was secure.  (70) Scarcely was he dead, when the Philistines began to menace  the Israelites and their king. Soon it appeared how well justified  had been the mourning services for the departed prophet in all the  Israelitish towns. (71) It was not remarkable that the mourning for  Samuel should have been universal. During his active  administration as judge, he had been in the habit of journeying  through every part of the country, and so he was known personally  to all the people. This practice of his testifies not only to the zeal  with which he devoted himself to his office, but also to his wealth,  for the expenses entailed by these journeys were defrayed from his  own purse. Only one person in all the land took no part in the  demonstrations of grief. During the very week of mourning Nabal  held feasts. \"What!\" God exclaimed, \"all weep and lament over the  death of the pious, and this reprobate engages in revelry!\"  Punishment was not withheld. Three days after the week of  mourning for Samuel Nabal dies. (72)    There was none that felt the death of Samuel more keenly than  Saul. Left alone and isolated, he did not shrink from extreme  measures to enter into communication with the departed prophet.  With his two adjutants, (73) Abner and Amasa, he betook himself  to Abner's mother, the witch of En-dor. (74) The king did not  reveal his identity, but the witch had no difficulty in recognizing  her visitor. In necromancy the peculiar rule holds good that, unless  it is summoned by a king, a spirit raised from the dead appears  head downward and feet in the air. (75) Accordingly, when the  figure of Samuel stood upright before them, the witch knew that  the king was with her. Though the witch saw Samuel, she could  not hear what he said, while Saul heard his words, but could not  see his person   another peculiar phenomenon in necromancy: the  conjuror sees the spirit, and he for whom the spirit had been raised  only hears it. Any other person present neither sees nor hears it.    The witch's excitement grew when she perceived a number of  spirits arise by the side of Samuel. The dead prophet, when he was  summoned back to earth, thought that the judgement day had  arrived. He requested Moses to accompany him and testify to his  always having executed the ordinances of the Torah as Moses had  established them. With these two great leaders a number of the  pious arose, all believing that the day of judgment was at hand.  Samuel was apparelled in the \"upper garment\" his mother had  made for him when she surrendered him to the sanctuary. This he  had worn throughout his life, and in it he was buried. At the  resurrection all the dead wear their grave clothes, and so it came  about that Samuel stood before Saul in his well-known \"upper  garment.\"    Only fragments of the conversation between Samuel and Saul have  been preserved in the Scriptures. Samuel reproached Saul with  having disturbed him. \"Was it not enough,\" he said, \"for thee to  enkindle the wrath of thy Creator by calling up the spirits of the  dead, must thou need change me into an idol? For is it not said that  like unto the worshippers so shall the worshipped be punished?\"  Samuel then consented to tell the king God's decree, that he had  resolved to rend the kingdom out of his hand, and invest David  with the royal dignity. Whereupon Saul: \"These are not the words  thou spakest to me before.\" (76) \"When we dwelt together,\"  rejoined Samuel, \"I was in the world of lies. Now I abide in the  world of truth, and thou heardest lying words from me, for I feared  thy wrath and thy revenge. Now I abide in the world of truth, and  thou hearest words of truth from me. As to the thing the Lord hath  done unto thee, thou hast deserved it, for thou didst not obey the  voice of the Lord, nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek.\" Saul  asked: \"Can I still save myself by flight?\" \"Yes,\" replied Samuel,  \"if thou fleest, thou art safe. But if thou acceptest God's judgment,  by to-morrow thou wilt be united with me in Paradise.\"    When Abner and Amasa questioned Saul about his interview with  Samuel, he replied: \"Samuel told me I should go into battle  to-morrow, and come forth victorious. More than that, my sons  will be given exalted positions in return for their military  prowess.\" The next day his three sons went with him to the war,  and all were stricken down. God summoned the angels and said to  them: \"Behold the being I have created in my world. A father as a  rule refrains from taking his sons even to a banquet, lest he expose  them to the evil eye. Saul goes to war knowing that he will lose his  life, yet he takes his sons with him, and cheerfully accepts the  punishment I ordain.\" (77)    So perished the first Jewish king, as a hero and a saint. His latter  days were occupied with regrets on account of the execution of the  priest of Nob, (78) and his remorse secured pardon for him. (79)  Indeed, in all respects his piety was so great that not even David  was his equal: David had many wives and concubines; Saul had  but on wife. David remained behind, fearing to lose his life in  battle with his son Absalom; Saul went into the combat knowing  he should not return alive. Mild and "]]]
