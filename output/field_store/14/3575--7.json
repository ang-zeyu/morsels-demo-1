Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,  contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong.  Intelligence is information that has been collected, integrated,  evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the  final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the  policymaker.    The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports  on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.  The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation  on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence  continually updates the  inventory of knowledge; and estimative  intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue  prospects for guidance of basic and  current intelligence. The World  Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence  Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities  since the days of George Washington but only since World War II have  they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and  coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as  Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In  the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch  amphibious operations against many islands about which information was  unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the  United States should never again be caught unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of  Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the  Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort should  be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that  recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing  Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy  Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental  basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government  for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic  intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34  JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous  letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.  Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,  \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based  planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar  world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on  national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in  war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities  - not just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947  and officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1  October 1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime  replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country  sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more  comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced  the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study  the structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in  1955 that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable  publication which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence  on all areas of the world. There will always be a continuing  requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was  created as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS  studies. The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962,  and the first unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS  program was terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and  gazetteer components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made  available to the public with sales through the US Government Printing  Office (GPO). The year 2004 marks the 57th anniversary of the  establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency and the 61st year of  continuous basic intelligence support to the US Government by The World  Factbook and its two predecessor programs.

The sheer volume  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#11)"],[1,"she was very proud of the  connection. No doubt she was unaware that M. de Rohan had received the  sacrament at the midnight mass said for the salvation of his soul by  Father Bourdaloue, for she said nothing about it, and hearing the  doctor's answer, only sighed.    \"Besides,\" he continued, \"in recalling examples of the kind, madame, you  must not build upon them, please: they are extraordinary cases, not the  rule. You must expect no privilege; in your case the ordinary laws will  be carried out, and your fate will not differ from the fate of other  condemned persons. How would it have been had you lived and died before  the reign of Charles VI? Up to the reign of this prince, the guilty died  without confession, and it was only by this king's orders that there was  a relaxation of this severity. Besides, communion is not absolutely  necessary to salvation, and one may communicate spiritually in reading  the word, which is like the body; in uniting oneself with the Church,  which is the mystical substance of Christ; and in suffering for Him and  with Him, this last communion of agony that is your portion, madame, and  is the most perfect communion of all. If you heartily detest your crime  and love God with all your soul, if you have faith and charity, your  death is a martyrdom and a new baptism.\"    \"Alas, my God,\" replied the marquise, \"after what you tell me, now that  I know the executioner's hand was necessary to my salvation, what should  I have become had I died at Liege? Where should I have been now? And  even if I had not been taken, and had lived another twenty years away  from France, what would my death have been, since it needed the scaffold  for my purification? Now I see all my wrong-doings, and the worst of all  is the last--I mean my effrontery before the judges. But all is not yet  lost, God be thanked; and as I have one last examination to go through,  I desire to make a complete confession about my whole life. You, Sir, I  entreat specially to ask pardon on my behalf of the first president;  yesterday, when I was in the dock, he spoke very touching words to me,  and I was deeply moved; but I would not show it, thinking that if I made  no avowal the evidence would not be sufficiently strong to convict me.  But it has happened otherwise, and I must have scandalised my judges by  such an exhibition of hardihood. Now I recognise my fault, and will  repair it. Furthermore, sir, far from feeling angry with the president  for the judgment he to-day passes against me, far from complaining of  the prosecutor who has demanded it, I thank them both most humbly, for  my salvation depends upon it.\"    The doctor was about to answer, encouraging her, when the door opened:  it was dinner coming in, for it was now half-past one. The marquise  paused and watched what was brought in, as though she were playing  hostess in her own country house. She made the woman and the two men who  watched her sit down to the table, and turning to the doctor, said,  \"Sir, you will not wish me to stand on ceremony with you; these good  people always dine with me to keep me company, and if you approve, we  will do the same to-day. This is the last meal,\" she added, addressing  them, \"that I shall take with you.\" Then turning to the woman, \"Poor  Madame du Rus,\" said she, \"I have been a trouble to you for a long time;  but have a little patience, and you will soon be rid of me. To-morrow  you can go to Dravet; you will have time, for in seven or eight hours  from now there will be nothing more to do for me, and I shall be in the  gentleman's hands; you will not be allowed near me. After then, you can  go away for good; for I don't suppose you will have the heart to see me  executed.\" All this she said quite calmly, but not with pride. From time  to time her people tried to hide their tears, and she made a sign of  pitying them. Seeing that the dinner was on the table and nobody eating,  she invited the doctor to take some soup, asking him to excuse the  cabbage in it, which made it a common soup and unworthy of his  acceptance. She herself took some soup and two eggs, begging her  fellow-guests to excuse her for not serving them, pointing out that no  knife or fork had been set in her place.    When the meal was almost half finished, she begged the doctor to let her  drink his health. He replied by drinking hers, and she seemed to be  quite charmed by, his condescension. \"To-morrow is a fast day,\" said  she, setting down her glass, \"and although it will be a day of great  fatigue for me, as I shall have to undergo the question as well as  death, I intend to obey the orders of the Church and keep my fast.\"    \"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"if you needed soup to keep you up, you  would not have to feel any scruple, for it will be no self-indulgence,  but a necessity, and the Church does not exact fasting in such a case.\"    \"Sir,\" replied the marquise, \"I will make no difficulty about it, if it  is necessary and if you order it; but it will not be needed, I think: if  I have some soup this evening for supper, and some more made stronger  than usual a little before midnight, it will be enough to last me  through to-morrow, if I have two fresh eggs to take after the question.\"    \"In truth,\" says the priest in the account we give here, \"I was alarmed  by this calm behaviour. I trembled when I heard her give orders to the  concierge that the soup was to be made stronger than usual and that she  was to have two cups before midnight. When dinner was over, she was  given pen and ink, which she had already asked for, and told me that she  had a letter to write before I took up my pen to put down what she  wanted to dictate.\" The letter, she explained, which was difficult to  write, was to her husband. She would feel easier when it was written.  For her husband she expressed so much affection, that the doctor,  knowing what had passed, felt much surprised, and wishing to try her,  said that the affection was not reciprocated, as her husband had  abandoned her the whole time of the trial. The marquise interrupted him:    \"My father, we must not judge things too quickly or merely by  appearances. M. de Brinvilliers has always concerned himself with me,  and has only failed in doing what it was impossible to do. Our  interchange of letters never ceased while I was out of the kingdom; do  not doubt but that he would have come to Paris as soon as he knew I was  in prison, had the state of his affairs allowed him to come safely. But  you must know that he is deeply in debt, and could not appear in Paris  without being arrested. Do not suppose that he is without feeling for  me.\"    She then began to write, and when her letter was finished she handed it  to the doctor, saying, \"You, sir, are the lord and master of all my  sentiments from now till I die; read this letter, and if you find  anything that should be altered, tell me.\"    This was the letter--    \"When I am on the point of yielding up my soul to God, I wish to assure  you of my affection for you, which I shall feel until the last moment of  my life. I ask your pardon for all that I have done contrary to my duty.  I am dying a shameful death, the work of my enemies: I pardon them with  all my heart, and I pray you to do the same. I also beg you to forgive  me for any ignominy that may attach to you herefrom; but consider that  we are only here for a time, and that you may soon be forced to render  an account to God of all your actions, and even your idle words, just as  I must do now. Be mindful of your worldly affairs, and of our children,  and give them a good example; consult Madame Marillac and Madame Couste.  Let as many prayers as possible be said for me, and believe that in my  death I am still ever yours, D'AUBRAY.\"    The doctor read this letter carefully; then he told her that one of her  phrases was not right--the one about her enemies. \"For you have no other  enemies,\" said he, \"than your own crimes. Those whom you call your  enemies are those who love the memory of your father and brothers, whom  you ought to have loved more than they do.\"    \"But those who have sought my death,\" she replied, \"are my enemies, are  they not, and is it not a Christian act to forgive them?\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"they are not your enemies, but you are the  enemy of the human race: nobody can think without, horror of your  crimes.\"    \"And so, my father,\" she replied, \"I feel no resentment towards them,  and I desire to meet in Paradise those who have been chiefly  instrumental in taking me and bringing me here.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"what mean you by this? Such words are used  by some when they desire people's death. Explain, I beg, what you mean.\"    \"Heaven forbid,\" cried the marquise, \"that you should understand me  thus! Nay, may God grant them long prosperity in this world and infinite  glory in the next! Dictate a new letter, and I will write just what you  please.\"    When a fresh letter had been written, the marquise would attend to  nothing but her confession, and begged the doctor to take the pen for  her. \"I have done so many wrong thing's,\" she said, \"that if I only gave  you a verbal confession, I should never be sure I had given a complete  account.\"    Then they both knelt down to implore the grace of the Holy Spirit. They  said a 'Veni Creator' and a 'Salve Regina', and the doctor then rose and  seated himself at a table, while the marquise, still on her knees, began  a Confiteor and made her whole confession. At nine o'clock, Father  Chavigny, who had brought Doctor Pirot in the morning, came in again.  The marquise seemed annoyed, but still put a good face upon it. \"My  father,\" said she, \"I did not expect to see you so late; pray leave me a  few minutes longer with the doctor.\" He retired. \"Why has he come?\"  asked the marquise.    \"It is better for you not to be alone,\" said the doctor.    \"Then do you mean to leave me?\" cried the marquise,"]]]
