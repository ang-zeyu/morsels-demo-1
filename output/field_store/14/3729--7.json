The home of Rev. and Mrs. Montgomery Curry was a two-story log house  with wide open hall running the entire length of the house and with  rooms opening off either side. The kitchen was out a short distance from  the main house, with the dairy between the two, under a large hickory  tree.    The slave quarters were also built of logs, with space between for a  shed room and small garden plot and a few chickens. The slave women did  not go to the fields on Saturday as that was their day to clean up  around their homes. They usually washed their clothes at night and hung  them on the bushes where they were left to dry in the sunshine, maybe a  couple of days, as no one could or would disturb them.    Rev. Montgomery Curry was a Baptist preacher and had no overseer, except  Lucy Linier and her husband, Emma's grandparents, who kept a supervision  over the slaves about 40 in number. There was no whipping allowed on the  Curry plantation, and after the death of Reverend Curry, Mrs. Ann Curry  (his widow) ran the plantation under the same system. The patrollers had  no jurisdiction over the Curry slaves, they were given permits by the  Currys to go and come, and Emma said if one of those patrollers whipped  one of \"ole Miss's slaves, she would have sure sued them.    Emma laughingly said the slaves on other plantations always said the  Curry slaves were \"free niggers,\" as they could always get permits, and  had plenty to eat and milk to drink. The slaves cooked their breakfasts  in their own cabins, but dinner and supper was cooked in the kitchen and  each came with their pan to be filled and had their own gourds which  were grown on the place to drink their milk and of which they could have  full and plenty.    During the war they cooked for the Confederate soldiers encamped nearby  and great quantities were prepared. Emma was one of those delegated to  carry the food to the camp. All she ever saw of the Yankees were two who  stopped at the house and asked for something to eat. Mrs. Montgomery  invited them in and served the best she had. One of the men wanted to  take the last mule she had and the other said \"No, Mrs. Montgomery is a  widow and from the appearance of her slaves she has treated them well.\"    Mrs. Montgomery told them that someone had stolen her saddle horse and  the soldier who had remonstrated with the other replied: \"Madam, your  saddle horse will be returned in three weeks,\" and sure enoug, one night  about midnight they heard a horse whinny and Emma's grandfather said  \"there is old Spunk,\" and there was old Spunk waiting outside.    Emma said the first whipping she ever had, was after the Surrender,  given her by her own father when they left Alabama and went to live near  Columbus, Miss.    She had always lived in the house with the \"old Miss\" and her young  Miss, and when she had to leave them, she cried and so did they.    Her grandmother Lucy Linier nursed \"Miss Ann\"; Lucy's daughter Patsy  nursed \"Miss Ann's\" children, and was the special property of Fannie  Montgomery Curry, who married a Mr. Sidney Lipscomb and whose children  Emma helped to look after, so the three generations were interwoven.    Emma only wishes she could go back to plantation days. All her trials  and suffering came after she left \"Ole Miss,\" and went to live with her  father and mother, George and Patsy Curry, who had fourteen children and  of which Emma was the eldest. Her father who was a quadroon in cast was  cruel to his family, and especially so to her. He made her work like a  man, cutting timber, splitting rails, digging, planting and all work of  the farm.    Now, Emma is the only member of her family left. She married three  times, having only two children, a girl and a boy, these by her last  husband, Frank Chapman, now dead, and Emma has no knowledge of her  children's whereabouts. She gave them an education so they could write  to her if they wanted to. The girl married and left Mobile, the boy went  to Chicago, was chauffeur for some rich folks. His last letter several  years ago, in which he enclosed $25.00, stated he was going on a trip to  Jerusalem with one of the young men of the family.          Henry Cheatam          *Interview with Henry Cheatam*      --_Ila B. Prine_    _I HEARD LINCOLN SET US FREE_    \"White folks, I'se glad you drapped by to have a talk wid me. I was  gittin' powerfully lonely,\" said Henry Cheatam, who lives in Marysville,  a Mobile suburb. \"Sho' I'll be glad to tell you some about de slave  days. I sho' 'members plenty. Well, to begin wid, I was born in 1850  near West Point. Dat's in Clay County, Mississippi, you know. I b'longed  to Mr. Tom Hollingshead who was killed in de Cibil War. I 'members all  de slaves agoin' in to take a last look at him atter dey done brung his  body home.    \"My mammy's name was Emmeline Cheatam, an' my pappy's was Sam Cheatam. I  don't remember my grandpappy an' grandmammy atall.    \"Us slaves libed in log cabins what was daubed wid clay to keep de rain  an' win' out, an' de chimneys was made of clay an' sticks. De beds was  home-made an' nailed agin' de wall wid legs on de outer side. De Massa's  house was build of logs too, but it was much bigger'n de nigger cabins  an' sot way out in front of ourn. Atter de massa was kilt, old Miss had  a nigger oberseer an' dat was de meanest debil dat eber libbed on de  Lawd's green yearth. I promise myself when I growed up dat I was agoin'  to kill dat nigger iffen it was de las' thing I eber done. Lots of times  I'se seen him beat my mammy, an' one day I seen him beat my Auntie who  was big wid a chile, an' dat man dug a roun' hole in de groun' an' put  her stummick in it, an' beat an' beat her for a half hour straight till  the baby come out raght dere in de hole.    \"Why de Mistis 'low such treatment? A heap of times ole Miss didn't know  nuthin' 'bout it, an' de slaves better not tell her, 'caze dat oberseer  whup 'em iffen he finds out dat dey done gone an' tol'. Yassun, white  folks, I'se seed some turrible things in my time. When de slaves would  try to run away our oberseer would put chains on dere legs wid big long  spikes tween dere feets, so dey couldn't git away. Den I's seen great  bunches of slaves put up on de block an' sol' jus' lak dey was cows.  Sometimes de chilluns would be seprated from dere maws an' paws.    \"I come pretty near to bein' tuk away from my maw. When de slaves was  bein' 'vided, one of ole Miss' datters was agoin' to Texas, an' I was  goin' to have to go when somebody hollered 'Freedom', an' I sho' was  glad 'caze I could stay wid my mammy now.    \"In dose days us had plenty of good, plain food; such as pot likker,  greens, cornbread, 'taters, peas, pears, an' at hog killin' us had  chittlin's an' pig jowls an' back bone. Den us would cotch 'possums at  night when dey come up in de corn fiel'. Us neber seed no flour dough.    \"As for fishin', we neber did none, 'caze we hadda work too hard. We  worked from 'can to can't.' Git up at sunrise, go to de fiel' an' stay  till dark. In de middle of de day dey would sen' our somp'n t'eat to de  fiel' wid a barrel of water. But for breakfas' an' supper, us hadda cook  our own grub dey gib us.    \"Our clo's warn't many. Us chilluns wo' a one-piece suit made outen  osnaburg, an' us would hab to take dat off at night, wash it an' put it  back on de nex' day. As for shoes, chillun neber had none. You see,  white folks, I was jus' a chile, jus' big enough to tote water to de  fiel's.    [Illustration: _Henry Cheatam, Marysville, Alabama_]    \"I 'members when de Yankees was acomin' th'ough I hoped to ca'y de  hosses to de woods an' hoped to hide de meat an' bury de valu'bles,  'caze dem Yankees tuk whatever dey wanted, an' you better not say  nothin' neither 'caze dey had dem long swyords ahangin' at dere sides.    \"In dem days, de slaves done all de work an' carried all de news. De  marsters sont notes from one plantation to anudder, an' when dey wanted  de niggers to come to de Big House dey would blow an ole cow horn. Dey  had certain number of blows for certain niggers. Dat is, de niggers dat  was somp'n. Dey would also use dis horn for 'possum an' coon huntin' at  night. De li'l niggers at night went to de big house to spin an' weave.  I'se spun a many roll an' carded a many bat of cotton. I'se also made a  many tallow candle by tyin' strings onto a long stick an' droppin dem  down into moulds filled wid tallow. I'se hid many a night in de fence  corners when I'd be agoin' som'ers to git my mammy some 'bacco. De  pattyrollers would be out lookin' for slaves dat didn't hab no pass from  dere oberseer, an' I'd hear dem acomin' an' I'd hide till dey pass on,  'caze iffen dey cotch me I sho' gwine have a sound beatin'.    \"De owners always tuk care of us, and when us got sick dey would git a  doctor, an' ole Miss was all right, but dat oberseer was a debil. He  wouldn't 'low no meetin' on de place. Sometimes us would slip down de  hill an' turn de wash pot bottom up'ards so de soun' of our voices would  go under de pot, an' us'd have a singin' an' prayin' raght dere.    \"Mos' of de slave could go sometimes to de white folks church when dey  gits a pass from dere Massa, but dat mean oberseer always tried to keep  us from goin' so's us couldn't learn nothin'. He didn't want us to learn  to read or write neither.    \"No'm us didn't have nothin' lak matches till I was growed. Us used  flint rocks an' cotton to start de fires.    \"Us didn't have nothin' but food an' clothes. We didn't have no garden  of our own an' der wan't no celebratin', 'ceptin' at hog killin'. Dat  was de bigges' day of de year.    \"On Sat'day afternoon we was 'lowed to play, but I can't 'member none of  de games. Us jus' played lak all li'l niggers did den.

Den a large piece was drapped in de river and on de other side.  Dey was led on, each one trying to git a piece as it was drapped.  Finally, when de ship was reached, dey drapped large pieces on de plank  and up into de ship 'till dey got as many blacks on board as dey wanted.  Den de gate was chained up and dey could not get back. Dat is de way  Granny Judith say dey got her to America. Of course she did not even  know dat de pieces was red flannel, or dat she was being enticed away.  Dey just drapped red flannel to dem like us draps corn to chickens to  git dem on de roost at night.    \"When dey got on board de ship dey were tied until de ship got to sea;  den dey was let loose to walk about 'cause dey couldn't jump overboard.  On de ship dey had many strange things to eat, and dey liked dat. Dey  was give enough red flannel to wrap around demselves. She liked it on de  boat. Granny Judith born Millie, and Millie born me. No, I ain't never  had no desire to go to Africa, kaise I gwine to stay whar I is.    \"Uncle Tom come 'long wid Granny Judith. Two womenfolks come wid dem,  aunt Chany and Daphne. Aunt Chany and aunt Daphne was bought by de Frees  dat had a plantation near Jonesville. Uncle Tom and 'Granny' was bought  by Marse Jim Gist, but dere marsters allus 'lowed dem to visit on July  4th and Christmas. When dey talk, nobody didn't know what dey was  talking about. My granny never could speak good like I can. She talk  half African, and all African when she git bothered. No, I can't talk no  African.    \"After I was seventeen I did all kinds of hoeing and plowing and other  farm work fer my marster. He said dat by dis time, his little niggers'  bones had done got hard enough fer dem to work. We had a 'driver', a  older person, dat showed us how to do everything right. Marse never let  him over-work or hurry us. We liked him--'Uncle July Gist', we called  him and dat was his real name, too. His wife, Aunty Sara, was good to  us; dey both buried at Woodson's Chapel Baptist Church.    \"Fer my first task I had 1/4 of an acre in taters, 'bacca and  watermelons de first year. Some of de boys had 'pinders, cantloupes and  matises (tomatoes) in dere task of a 1/4 acre.    \"De next year, we made corn and sold it to our master fer whatever he  give us fer it. All de use we had fer money was to buy fish hooks,  barlows, juice harps and marbles. Boys did not use 'bacca den until dey  got twenty-one or over. Marse allus carried a roll of money as big as my  arm. He would come to de quarter on Christmas, July 4th and  Thanksgiving, and get up on a stump and call all the chilluns out. Den  he would throw money to 'em. De chilluns git dimes, nickles, quarters,  half-dollars and dollars. At Christmas he would throw ten dollar bills.  De parents would take de five and ten dollar bills in charge, but Marse  made de let de chilluns keep de small change. I tell you, I ain't never  seed so much money since my marster been gone. He buried at Fairforest  Presbyterian Cemetery as white folks calls it, but we calls it Cedar  Grove.    \"When he died, he had sixteen plantations, you can see dat at de  courthouse in Union. All his darkies went in a drove of wagons to his  burying. He was killed by dem Yankees in Virginny. Uncle Wylie Smith,  his bodyguard, come back wid his body and told us dat Marse was kilt by  a Yankee. Marse Jim was a sentinel, and dat Yankee shot him in his nose,  but strange to say, it never tore his face up none. Miss Sara buried him  in his uniform and she wrapped a Confederate flag over de top of de  coffin. Uncle Wylie put Master's watch around Miss Sara's neck like he  had done told him to do when he got home. Miss Sara cried and us cried,  too. Jim never married and dat's why Miss Sara to do everything, kaise  she was his sister what lived wid him.    \"Mr., I run on Broad River fer over 24 years as boatman, carrying Marse  Jim's cotton to Columbia fer him. Us had de excitement on dem trips.  Lots times water was deeper dan a tree is high. Sometimes I was throwed  and fell in de water. I rise up every time, though, and float and swim  back to de boat and git on again. If de weather be hot, I never think of  changing no clothes, but just keep on what I got wet. Five niggers allus  went on Marse's boat. One man steer de boat and of course he was de  steerman, and dat what he went by. I recollects two steermans, Bradley  Kennedy and Andy McCluny. Charlie Gilliam was de second steerman, by dat  I means dat he de young nigger dat Bradley and Andy had to break in.    \"Sometimes Marster have three flat boats a-gwine down at one time, and I  has recollections of as many as five a-gwine from our plantation; dat  was not so often, though. Us had long poles to steer de boats wid; den  dere was some paddles, and some of de niggers was called privates dat  handled de cotton and used de paddles when dey had to be used. You knows  dat batteaus was what dey always used de paddles wid. Privates did de  shoving and other heavy work. De seconds and de privates allus shoved  wid de poles when de water was rough, and de steerman give orders. I was  allus a boatman.    \"Charlie Gilliam acted as boatman, some; and den de other boatmen was:  Bill Hughes, Warren Worthy, Green Stokes and John Glenn. Dey made de  poles to suit de job. Some of de poles was longer dan others was. Some  of dem was broad and flat at de end; others was blunt and others was  made sharp. When de Broad River rose, sometimes de waves got higher dan  my house dar. Den it was a real job to handle one of Marse's boats. Fact  is, it was five men's jobs. Wid water a-roaring and a-foaming and  a-gwine round you like a mad tiger a-blowing his breath, so dat you was  feer'd (scared) dat all your marster's cotton gwine to be spilt, you had  to be up and a-doing something real fast. Sometimes dat river take your  boat round and round like a merry-go-round, 'til you git so  swimmy-headed dat you have to puke up all de victuals dat you done eat.  Den it swing from dat whirl into a swift stream dat take you a mile a  minute, yes sir, a mile a minute fer I don't know how fer.    \"Den you see a tree a-coming right straight to you. If de boat hit dat  tree, you knowed dat you be busted into a million pieces. You had to git  your poles and somebody had to let a pole hit dat tree ahead of de boat.  Of course dat change de boat's course from de tree and you went sailing  on by. Once in a freshet us raced twenty-five miles in twenty-five  minutes. Marse Jim was wid us dat time, and he tole us so by his watch.  De water a-jumping real high and dat boat a-jumping still wusser made me  so skeer't dat I just shake in my knees and all de way up and down my  legs.    \"On dis trip we had went plumb up in North Carolina. Us never had been  dat fer up befo'. I ain't never seed North carolina befo'; neither is I  seed it since. Broad River was real narrow when we went up and she look  like a lamb; but when we come down it had done and tuck and rained and  dem banks was vanished ... but dat water sho did rare up dar to git back  in its regular channel. De rocks up dar was mo' scary looking dat dey is  whar it run through Union to Columbia. Dat night we run into a nine-mile  shoal. Couldn't none de niggers keep dat boat off'n dat shoal it was so  powerful ... dat is, de water just tuck dat boat plumb smack out'n our  hands. But it throwed our boat in shallow water and of course dat made  it drag. Good dat it never drug over no sharp rocks--and dey was setting  all around us--but it happened dat it hit sand. We camped dar fer de  night. By morning we had done go a quarter mile from de channel.    \"When we et (ate), we worked de boat out into de main channel again. Den  we staked her to a tree and tuck a look around befo' we started down  stream fer Union; dat seemed fer off right den. Finally de master  boatman give de order, 'Shove off, boys!' We shoved and we fell into a  clear open channel and our boat went a-skeeting down stream. We never  had to hit a lick, but she went so fast dat we was all skeer'd to take a  long breath. Finally Marster said, 'Boys, see dem willow trees down  yonder; well, steer her to run over dem so dat she will slack her  speed.' Us did, but it never deadened our speed a mite, dat us could  see. Marster shake his head and 'low, 'Bound fer hell, maybe, boys'.    \"Got to Cherokee Falls, wid water so high couldn't tell no falls dar.  Marster say, 'Lay her to de right, we can't wreck dis boat widout  putting up a honest man's fight.' Den he say, 'If us does, us'll sho go  to hell.' We tried to swing her by grabbing to a big willow, and we  broke a lot of limbs in trying, but we did swing her and she run a 100  yards widout steering, and de boat landed on a little mountain of land.  Marse 'low, 'Ain't never seed sech a ocean of water since I was eighteen  years old, damn if I have.' He look at me and say, 'Don't know whether  Dick scared or not, but he sho is a brave man.' I was a-setting my feets  on land den, and I look at him and 'low, 'No sir, I ain't skeer't, why I  could come over dat little place in my bateau.' Truth is, dat I was so  skeer't dat I wasn't skeert. We lay over a day and a half. De water had  done receded back some, and we come 27 miles down to Lockhart Shoals in  dat one day. De water was still so high dat we run over de shoals widout  a tremor. Come sailing on down to Fish Dam and went over de Fish Dam and  never knowed dat it was dar. Den we landed at de road wid everybody safe  but still scar't.    \"Dar was two Charlie Gilmores ... one was kil't right below Fish Dam. He  was hit in de head by a private. When de private was cutting de boat,  Charlie got in de way of de pole and it hit him in one of his temples  and he fell over in de water dead. When dey got him, wasn't narry drap  of water in his lungs, dat's how-come us knowed dat he was kil't  straight out. Some says dat he was hit in de y'er (ear),"]]]
