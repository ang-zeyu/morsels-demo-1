At which time, also,  John, when the snares he had laid did not take effect, returned back to  Gischala.    60. Now, in a few days, those ambassadors whom he had sent, came back  again and informed us, that the people were greatly provoked at Ananus,  and Simon the son of Gamaliel, and their friends; that, without any  public determination, they had sent to Galilee, and had done their  endeavors that I might be turned out of the government. The ambassadors  said further, that the people were ready to burn their houses. They  also brought letters, whereby the chief men of Jerusalem, at the earnest  petition of the people, confirmed me in the government of Galilee, and  enjoined Jonathan and his colleagues to return home quickly. When I had  gotten these letters, I came to the village Arbela, where I procured an  assembly of the Galileans to meet, and bid the ambassadors declare  to them the anger of the people of Jerusalem at what had been done  by Jonathan and his colleagues, and how much they hated their wicked  doings, and how they had confirmed me in the government of their  country, as also what related to the order they had in writing for  Jonathan and his colleagues to return home. So I immediately sent them  the letter, and bid him that carried it to inquire, as well as he could,  how they intended to act [on this occasion.]    61. Now, when they had received that letter, and were thereby greatly  disturbed, they sent for John, and for the senators of Tiberias, and for  the principal men of the Gabarens, and proposed to hold a council,  and desired them to consider what was to be done by them. However, the  governors of Tiberias were greatly disposed to keep the government to  themselves; for they said it was not fit to desert their city, now it  was committed to their trust, and that otherwise I should not delay to  fall upon them; for they pretended falsely that so I had threatened to  do. Now John was not only of their opinion, but advised them, that two  of them should go to accuse me before the multitude [at Jerusalem], that  I do not manage the affairs of Galilee as I ought to do; and that they  would easily persuade the people, because of their dignity, and because  the whole multitude are very mutable. When, therefore, it appeared that  John had suggested the wisest advice to them, they resolved that two of  them, Jonathan and Ananias, should go to the people of Jerusalem, and  the other two [Simon and Joazar] should be left behind to tarry at  Tiberins. They also took along with them a hundred soldiers for their  guard.    62. However, the governors of Tiberias took care to have their city  secured with walls, and commanded their inhabitants to take their arms.  They also sent for a great many soldiers from John, to assist them  against me, if there should be occasion for them. Now John was at  Gischala. Jonathan, therefore, and those that were with him, when they  were departed from Tiberias, and as soon as they were come to Dabaritta,  a village that lay in the utmost parts of Galilee, in the great  plain, they, about midnight, fell among the guards I had set, who both  commanded them to lay aside their weapons, and kept them in bonds upon  the place, as I had charged them to do. This news was written to me by  Levi, who had the command of that guard committed to him by me. Hereupon  I said nothing of it for two days; and, pretending to know nothing about  it, I sent a message to the people of Tiberias, and advised them to lay  their arms aside, and to dismiss their men, that they might go home.  But, supposing that Jonathan, and those that were with him, were already  arrived at Jerusalem, they made reproachful answers to me; yet was I not  terrified thereby, but contrived another stratagem against them, for I  did not think it agreeable with piety to kindle the fire of war against  the citizens. As I was desirous to draw those men away from Tiberias,  I chose out ten thousand of the best of my armed men, and divided them  into three bodies, and ordered them to go privately, and lie still as  an ambush, in the villages. I also led a thousand into another village,  which lay indeed in the mountains, as did the others, but only four  furlongs distant from Tiberias; and gave orders, that when they saw my  signal, they should come down immediately, while I myself lay with my  soldiers in the sight of every body. Hereupon the people of Tiberias, at  the sight of me, came running out of the city perpetually, and abused  me greatly. Nay, their madness was come to that height, that they made a  decent bier for me, and, standing about it, they mourned over me in the  way of jest and sport; and I could not but be myself in a pleasant humor  upon the sight of this madness of theirs.    63. And now being desirous to catch Simon by a wile, and Joazar with  him, I sent a message to them, and desired them to come a little way out  of the city, and many of their friends to guard them; for I said I  would come down to them, and make a league with them, and divide the  government of Galilee with them. Accordingly, Simon was deluded on  account of his imprudence, and out of the hopes of gain, and did not  delay to come; but Joazar, suspecting snares were laid for him, staid  behind. So when Simon was come out, and his friends with him, for his  guard, I met him, and saluted him with great civility, and professed  that I was obliged to him for his coming up to me; but a little while  afterward I walked along with him as though I would say something to him  by myself; and when I had drawn him a good way from his friends, I took  him about the middle, and gave him to my friends that were with me, to  carry him into a village; and, commanding my armed men to come down, I  with them made an assault upon Tiberias. Now, as the fight grew hot on  both sides, and the soldiers belonging to Tiberias were in a fair way to  conquer me, [for my armed men were already fled away,] I saw the posture  of my affairs; and encouraging those that were with me, I pursued those  of Tiberias, even when they were already conquerors, into the city. I  also sent another band of soldiers into the city by the lake, and gave  them orders to set on fire the first house they could seize upon. When  this was done, the people of Tiberinas thought that their city was taken  by force, and so threw down their arms for fear, and implored, they,  their wives, and children, that I would spare their city. So I was  over-persuaded by their entreaties, and restrained the soldiers from the  vehemency with which they pursued them; while I myself, upon the coming  on of the evening, returned back with my soldiers, and went to refresh  myself. I also invited Simon to sup with me, and comforted him on  occasion of what had happened; and I promised that I would send him safe  and secure to Jerusalem, and withal would give him provisions for his  journey thither.    64. But on the next day, I brought ten thousand armed men with me, and  came to Tiberias. I then sent for the principal men of the multitude  into the public place, and enjoined them to tell me who were the authors  of the revolt; and when they told me who the men were, I sent them bound  to the city Jotapata. But as to Jonathan and Ananias, I freed them from  their bonds, and gave them provisions for their journey, together with  Simon and Joazar, and five hundred armed men who should guard them;  and so I sent them to Jerusalem. The people of Tiberias also came to me  again, and desired that I would forgive them for what they had done; and  they said they would amend what they had done amiss with regard to me,  by their fidelity for the time to come; and they besought me to preserve  what spoils remained upon the plunder of the city, for those that had  lost them. Accordingly, I enjoined those that had got them, to bring  them all before us; and when they did not comply for a great while, and  I saw one of the soldiers that were about me with a garment on that was  more splendid than ordinary, I asked him whence he had it; and when  he replied that he had it out of the plunder of the city, I had him  punished with stripes; and I threatened all the rest to inflict a  severer punishment upon them, unless they produced before us whatsoever  they had plundered; and when a great many spoils were brought together,  I restored to every one of Tiberias what they claimed to be their own.    65. And now I am come to this part of my narration, I have a mind to say  a few things to Justus, who hath himself written a history concerning  these affairs, as also to others who profess to write history, but have  little regard to truth, and are not afraid, either out of ill-will or  good-will to some persons, to relate falsehoods. These men do like  those who compose forged deeds and conveyances; and because they are not  brought to the like punishment with them, they have no regard to truth.  When, therefore, Justus undertook to write about these facts, and about  the Jewish war, that he might appear to have been an industrious man,  he falsified in what he related about me, and could not speak truth  even about his own country; whence it is that, being belied by him, I  am under a necessity to make my defense; and so I shall say what I have  concealed till now. And let no one wonder that I have not told the world  these things a great while ago. For although it be necessary for an  historian to write the truth, yet is such a one not bound severely to  animadvert on the wickedness of certain men; not out of any favor to  them, but out of an author's own moderation. How then comes it to pass,  O Justus! thou most sagacious of writers, [that I may address myself to  him as if he were here present,] for so thou boastest of thyself, that  I and the Galileans have been the authors of that sedition which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#11)"],[1,"he left the land of Chaldea when  he was seventy-five years old, and at the command of God went into  Canaan, and therein he dwelt himself, and left it to his posterity. He  was a person of great sagacity, both for understanding all things and  persuading his hearers, and not mistaken in his opinions; for which  reason he began to have higher notions of virtue than others had, and he  determined to renew and to change the opinion all men happened then to  have concerning God; for he was the first that ventured to publish this  notion, That there was but one God, the Creator of the universe; and  that, as to other [gods], if they contributed any thing to the happiness  of men, that each of them afforded it only according to his appointment,  and not by their own power. This his opinion was derived from the  irregular phenomena that were visible both at land and sea, as well as  those that happen to the sun, and moon, and all the heavenly bodies,  thus:\"If [said he] these bodies had power of their own, they would  certainly take care of their own regular motions; but since they do not  preserve such regularity, they make it plain, that in so far as they co-  operate to our advantage, they do it not of their own abilities, but as  they are subservient to Him that commands them, to whom alone we ought  justly to offer our honor and thanksgiving.\" For which doctrines, when  the Chaldeans, and other people of Mesopotamia, raised a tumult against  him, he thought fit to leave that country; and at the command and by the  assistance of God, he came and lived in the land of Canaan. And when he  was there settled, he built an altar, and performed a sacrifice to God.    2. Berosus mentions our father Abram without naming him, when he says  thus: \"In the tenth generation after the Flood, there was among the  Chaldeans a man righteous and great, and skillful in the celestial  science.\" But Hecatseus does more than barely mention him; for he  composed, and left behind him, a book concerning him. And Nicolaus of  Damascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: \"Abram reigned  at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land  above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time,  he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and  went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of  Judea, and this when his posterity were become a multitude; as to which  posterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name  of Abram is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is  shown a village named from him, The Habitation of Abram.\"              CHAPTER 8. That When There Was A Famine In Canaan, Abram Went Thence  Into Egypt; And After He Had Continued There A While He Returned Back  Again.    1. Now, after this, when a famine had invaded the land of Canaan, and  Abram had discovered that the Egyptians were in a flourishing condition,  he was disposed to go down to them, both to partake of the plenty they  enjoyed, and to become an auditor of their priests, and to know what  they said concerning the gods; designing either to follow them, if they  had better notions than he, or to convert them into a better way, if his  own notions proved the truest. Now, seeing he was to take Sarai with  him, and was afraid of the madness of the Egyptians with regard to  women, lest the king should kill him on occasion of his wife's great  beauty, he contrived this device:he pretended to be her brother, and  directed her in a dissembling way to pretend the same, for he said it  would be for their benefit. Now, as soon as he came into Egypt, it  happened to Abram as he supposed it would; for the fame of his wife's  beauty was greatly talked of; for which reason Pharaoh, the king of  Egypt, would not be satisfied with what was reported of her, but would  needs see her himself, and was preparing to enjoy her; but God put a  stop to his unjust inclinations, by sending upon him a distemper, and a  sedition against his government. And when he inquired of the priests how  he might be freed from these calamities, they told him that this his  miserable condition was derived from the wrath of God, upon account of  his inclinations to abuse the stranger's wife. He then, out of fear,  asked Sarai who she was, and who it was that she brought along with her.  And when he had found out the truth, he excused himself to Abram, that  supposing the woman to be his sister, and not his wife, he set his  affections on her, as desiring an affinity with him by marrying her, but  not as incited by lust to abuse her. He also made him a large present in  money, and gave him leave to enter into conversation with the most  learned among the Egyptians; from which conversation his virtue and his  reputation became more conspicuous than they had been before.    2. For whereas the Egyptians were formerly addicted to different  customs, and despised one another's sacred and accustomed rites, and  were very angry one with another on that account, Abram conferred with  each of them, and, confuting the reasonings they made use of, every one  for their own practices, demonstrated that such reasonings were vain and  void of truth: whereupon he was admired by them in those conferences as  a very wise man, and one of great sagacity, when he discoursed on any  subject he undertook; and this not only in understanding it, but in  persuading other men also to assent to him. He communicated to them  arithmetic, and delivered to them the science of astronomy; for before  Abram came into Egypt they were unacquainted with those parts of  learning; for that science came from the Chaldeans into Egypt, and from  thence to the Greeks also.    3. As soon as Abram was come back into Canaan, he parted the land  between him and Lot, upon account of the tumultuous behavior of their  shepherds, concerning the pastures wherein they should feed their  flocks. However, he gave Lot his option, or leave, to choose which lands  he would take; and he took himself what the other left, which were the  lower grounds at the foot of the mountains; and he himself dwelt in  Hebron, which is a city seven years more ancient than Tunis of Egypt.  But Lot possessed the land of the plain, and the river Jordan, not far  from the city of Sodom, which was then a fine city, but is now  destroyed, by the will and wrath of God, the cause of which I shall show  in its proper place hereafter.              CHAPTER 9. The Destruction Of The Sodomites By The Assyrian War.    At this time, when the Assyrians had the dominion over Asia, the people  of Sodom were in a flourishing condition, both as to riches and the  number of their youth. There were five kings that managed the affairs of  this county: Ballas, Barsas, Senabar, and Sumobor, with the king of  Bela; and each king led on his own troops: and the Assyrians made war  upon them; and, dividing their army into four parts, fought against  them. Now every part of the army had its own commander; and when the  battle was joined, the Assyrians were conquerors, and imposed a tribute  on the kings of the Sodomites, who submitted to this slavery twelve  years; and so long they continued to pay their tribute: but on the  thirteenth year they rebelled, and then the army of the Assyrians came  upon them, under their commanders Amraphel, Arioch, Chodorlaomer, and  Tidal. These kings had laid waste all Syria, and overthrown the  offspring of the giants. And when they were come over against Sodom,  they pitched their camp at the vale called the Slime Pits, for at that  time there were pits in that place; but now, upon the destruction of the  city of Sodom, that vale became the Lake Asphaltites, as it is called.  However, concerning this lake we shall speak more presently. Now when  the Sodomites joined battle with the Assyrians, and the fight was very  obstinate, many of them were killed, and the rest were carried captive;  among which captives was Lot, who had come to assist the Sodomites.              CHAPTER 10. How Abram Fought With The Assyrians, And Overcame Them, And  Saved The Sodomite Prisoners, And Took From The Assyrians The Prey They  Had Gotten.    1. When, Abram heard of their calamity, he was at once afraid for Lot  his kinsman, and pitied the Sodomites, his friends and neighbors; and  thinking it proper to afford them assistance, he did not delay it, but  marched hastily, and the fifth night fell upon the Assyrians, near Dan,  for that is the name of the other spring of Jordan; and before they  could arm themselves, he slew some as they were in their beds, before  they could suspect any harm; and others, who were not yet gone to sleep,  but were so drunk they could not fight, ran away. Abram pursued after  them, till, on the second day, he drove them in a body unto Hoba, a  place belonging to Damascus; and thereby demonstrated that victory does  not depend on multitude and the number of hands, but the alacrity and  courage of soldiers overcome the most numerous bodies of men, while he  got the victory over so great an army with no more than three hundred  and eighteen of his servants, and three of his friends: but all those  that fled returned home ingloriously.    2. So Abram, when he had saved the captive Sodomites, who had been taken  by the Assyrians, and Lot also, his kinsman, returned home in peace. Now  the king of Sodom met him at a certain place, which they called The  King's Dale, where Melchisedec, king of the city Salem, received him.  That name signifies, the righteous king: and such he was, without  dispute, insomuch that, on this account, he was made the priest of God:  however, they afterward called Salem Jerusalem. Now this Melchisedec  supplied Abram's army in an hospitable manner, and gave them provisions  in abundance; and as they were feasting, he began to praise him, and to  bless God for subduing his enemies under him.
