Presently he took to crawling, or rather  running, over a thread of conferva, and then his back was elegantly  arched, and his cilia stood erect like the quills of a porcupine. This  was the _Chaetonotus larus_.    [Illustration: Chaetonotus larus (crawling).]    In Pritchard's \"Infusoria,\" the views of those writers are followed who  rank this animal amongst the Rotifers, and place it in the family  _Icthidina_. To help out this theory, the cilia upon the ventral surface  are imagined to form a \"band-like rotary organ;\" but in truth they bear  no resemblance whatever to the so-called wheels of the ordinary  Rotifers, nor is there anything like the gizzard which true Rotifers  present. Ehrenberg treated it as a Rotifer, and Dujardin placed it among  the Infusoria, in a particular class, comprehending symmetrical  organisms. The 'Microscopic Dictionary' remarks that its \"structure  requires further investigation,\"[12] and while the learned decide all  the intricate questions of its zoological rank, the ordinary observer  will be pleased to watch its singular aspect and lively motions. Its  size, according to the 'Micrographic Dictionary,' varies from 1--710\" to  1--220\", and while its general proceeding may be watched with an inch or  two-thirds object-glass, and the second eye-piece, a power of five  hundred linear (obtained by a quarter or a fifth) is required to make  out the details of its structure. If placed in a live-box with threads  of conferva, and a little decayed vegetation, it may be observed to  group about among them, and shake them like a dog.    [12] See a valuable paper by Mr. Gosse, \"History of the Hairy-backed  Animalcules,\" 'Intellectual Observer,' vol. v, p. 387, in which the  known species are described and reasons given for following Vogt and  ranging them with the Turbellarian worms.    We have said that water-fleas were among the inhabitants of a bottle  filled at the pond, and as they go the way of all flesh, it is common to  find some odd-looking animalcules ready to devour their mortal remains.  These are creatures shaped like beer-barrels, upon short legs, and which  swim with a tubby rolling gait. Looking at one of these little tubs  lengthwise, a number of lines are seen, as though the edge of each stave  projected a little above the general level, and transverse markings are  also apparent, which may be compared to hoops. This is the _Coleps  hirtus_, which differs from the usual type of Infusoria, by being  symmetrical, that is, divisible into two equal and similar halves. The  dimensions of this species vary from 1--570 to 1--430, and its colour  varies from white to brown. It has been observed to increase by  transverse self-division, and has two orifices, one at each end, for  receiving food and ejecting the remains. It often requires some little  trouble to get a good view of the cilia, which are arranged in  transverse and longitudinal rows. A power of one hundred and fifty  linear is convenient for viewing it in motion, but when quiet under  pressure, one of five or six hundred may be used with advantage.    [Illustration: Coleps hirtus.]    Among the rubbish at the bottom of the bottle, in which the coleps was  found, was a minute dead Rotifer, the flesh of which was fast  disappearing, but upon being examined with a power of nine hundred and  sixty diameters, it was observed to swarm with extremely minute  _vibriones_, the largest only appearing under that immense magnification  like chains of bluish-green globules, not bigger than the heads of  minikin pins, while the smallest were known by a worm-like wriggling,  although their structure could not be defined. These _vibriones_ are  probably members of the vegetable world, and they always appear when  animal matter undergoes putrefaction.    M. Pasteur has brought forward elaborate experiments to show that the  development of the yeast plant is an act correlative to alcoholic  fermentation, and in like manner the growth of _vibriones_ may stand in  correlation to putrefactive decomposition.    [Illustration: A, Euplotes (patella); B, side view of ditto; C,  stylonichia.]    Ehrenberg considered them animals, and fancied he detected in them a  plurality of stomachs; but the vegetable theory is the more probable, at  any rate of the species under our notice, which is often seen, though  not always so minute.    At this time two interesting animalcules were very plentiful--the  _Euplotes patella_, and _Stylonichia_, both remarkable as exhibiting an  advance in organization, which approximates them to the higher animals.  In addition to cilia they possess _styles_, which take the place of the  limbs of more elaborately-constructed creatures, and give a variety to  their means of locomotion. The _Euplotes_ is furnished with an oval  carapace covering the upper surface, which in different individuals, and  probably at different ages, exhibits slightly varied markings round its  margin, which in the specimen drawn above consisted of dots. They can  run, climb, or swim, and exemplify a singular habit which several of the  infusoria possess, that of moving for a little time in one direction,  and then suddenly, and without any apparent cause, reversing it. If the  reader is fond of learned appellations, he can call this _diastrophy_,  but we do not know that he will be any the wiser for it.    The Stylonichia are oval animalcules, surrounded by cilia, and having  moreover a collection of styles, both straight and curved, the latter  called _uncini_, or little hooks. They swim steadily on, and then dart  back, but not so far as they have advanced, and may be seen to keep up  this fidgety motion by the hour together. Pritchard tells us Ehrenberg  found that a single animalcule lived nine days; during the first  twenty-four hours it was developed by transverse self-division into  three animals; these in twenty-four hours formed two each in the same  manner, so that by self-division only (without ova), these animalcules  increased three or four-fold in twenty-four hours, and _may thus produce  a million_ from a single _animalcule in ten days_. Such are the amazing  powers of reproduction conferred upon these humble creatures, powers  which are fully employed when the surrounding circumstances are  favorable, and which, in the aggregate, change the condition of large  masses of matter, and bring within the circle of life millions upon  millions of particles every minute of the day.

May, the first of summer months, and of old famous for floral games,  which found their latest patrons in the chimney-sweeps of London, is a  good time for the microscopist among the ponds, for the increase of  warmth and heat favours both animal and vegetable life, and so we found  as we carried home some tops of myriophyllum, and soon discovered a  colony of tubicolor rotifers among the tiny branches. They proved to be  Floscules, generally resembling the _F. ornata_, described in a previous  page, but having a long slender proboscis hanging like a loose ringlet  down one side. The cilia or hairs were not so long as in the Beautiful  Floscules we had before obtained, nor was their manner of opening so  elegant; but they were, nevertheless, objects of great interest, and  were probably specimens of the _Floscularia cornuta_. A swimming rotifer  in a carapace somewhat fiddle-shaped, with one eye in its forehead, and  a two-pronged tail sticking out behind (the _Euchlanis triquetra_), also  served to occupy attention; but a further search among the myriophyllum  revealed more treasures of the tube-dwelling kind. These were specimens  of that highly curious Rotifer, the _Melicerta ringens_, who, not  content with dwelling, like the Floscules, in a gelatinous bottle, is at  once brickmaker, mason, and architect, and fabricates as pretty a tower  as it is easy to conceive. The creature itself stands upon a retractile  foot-stalk, and thrusts out above its battlements a large head, with  four leaf-like expansions surrounded by cilia. Between the lower lobes,  or leaves, the gizzard is seen grinding away, and above it is an organ,  not always displayed, and of which Mr. Gosse was fortunate enough to  discover the use. This eminent naturalist likens it to the circular  ventilator sometimes inserted in windows, and he found it was the  machine for making the yellow ornamental bricks of which the tower is  composed. Pellet by pellet, or brick by brick, does the Melicerta build  her house, which widens gradually from the foundation to the summit, and  every layer is placed with admirable regularity.    In order to obtain the materials for her brickmaking the Melicerta must  have the power of modifying the direction of the ciliary currents, so as  to throw a stream of small particles into the mould, which is a muscular  organ, and capable of secreting a waterproof cement, by which they are  fastened together. The result is, not to produce anything like the tubes  made by the caddis-worms out of grains of sand, but entirely to change  the appearance of the materials employed. All large particles are  rejected, and only those retained which will form a homogeneous pulp  with the viscid secretion; and when the process is complete the head of  the creature is bent down, and the pellet deposited in its appropriate  place.

DIVING FLAT INTO SHALLOW WATER (Page 83)]    During the fasting season, as none of the penguins had entered the  water, they all became very dirty and disreputable in appearance, as  well may be imagined considering the life they led, but now that they  went regularly to swim, they immediately got back their sleek and  spotless state.    From the ice-foot to the open water, the half mile or so of sea-ice  presented a lively scene as the thousands of birds passed to and fro  over it, outward bound parties of dirty birds from the rookery passing  the spruce bathers, homeward bound after their banquet and frolic in the  sea. So interesting and instructive was it to watch the bathing parties,  that we spent whole days in this way.    As I have said before, the couples took turn and turn about on the nest,  one remaining to guard and incubate while the other went off to the  water.    On leaving their nests, the birds made their way down the ice-foot on to  the sea-ice. Here they would generally wait about and join up with  others until enough had gathered together to make up a decent little  party, which would then set off gaily for the water. They were now in  the greatest possible spirits, chattering loudly and frolicking with one  another, and playfully chasing each other about, occasionally indulging  in a little friendly sparring with their flippers.    Arrived at length at the water's edge, almost always the same procedure  was gone through. The object of every bird in the party seemed to be to  get one of the others to enter the water first. They would crowd up to  the very edge of the ice, dodging about and trying to push one another  in. Sometimes those behind nearly would succeed in pushing the front  rank in, who then would just recover themselves in time, and rushing  round to the rear, endeavour to turn the tables on the others.  Occasionally one actually would get pushed in, only to turn quickly  under water and bound out again on to the ice like a cork shot out of a  bottle. Then for some time they would chase one another about, seemingly  bent on having a good game, each bird intent on finding any excuse from  being the first in. Sometimes this would last a few minutes, sometimes  for the better part of an hour, until suddenly the whole band would  change its tactics, and one of the number start to run at full tilt  along the edge of the ice, the rest following closely on his heels,  until at last he would take a clean header into the water. One after  another the rest of the party followed him (Fig. 38), all taking off  exactly from the spot where he had entered, and following one another so  quickly as to have the appearance of a lot of shot poured out of a  bottle into the water. The accompanying photograph presents this last  scene.      [Illustration: Fig. 46. DIVING FLAT INTO SHALLOW WATER (Page 83)]    A dead silence would ensue till a few seconds later, when they would all  come to the surface some twenty or thirty yards out, and start rolling  about and splashing in the water, cleaning themselves and making sounds  exactly like a lot of boys calling out and chaffing one another.    So extraordinary was this whole scene, that on first witnessing it we  were overcome with astonishment, and it seemed to us almost impossible  that the little creatures, whose antics we were watching, were actually  birds and not human beings. Seemingly reluctant as they had been to  enter the water, when once there they evinced every sign of enjoyment,  and would stay in for hours at a time.    As may be imagined, the penguins spent a great deal of time on their way  to and from the water, especially during the earlier period before the  sea-ice had broken away from the ice-foot, as they had so far to walk  before arriving at the open leads.    As a band of spotless bathers returning to the rookery, their white  breasts and black backs glistening with a fine metallic lustre in the  sunlight, met a dirty and bedraggled party on its way out from the  nesting ground, frequently both would stop, and the clean and dirty  mingle together and chatter with one another for some minutes. If they  were not speaking words in some language of their own, their whole  appearance belied them, and as they stood, some in pairs, some in groups  of three or more, chattering amicably together, it became evident that  they were sociable animals, glad to meet one another, and, like many  men, pleased with the excuse to forget for a while their duties at home,  where their mates were waiting to be relieved for their own spell off  the nests.    After a variable period of this intercourse, the two parties would  separate and continue on their respective ways, a clean stream issuing  from the crowd in the direction of the rookery, a dirty one heading off  towards the open water, but here it was seen that a few who had bathed  and fed, and were already perhaps half-way home, had been persuaded to  turn and accompany the others, and so back they would go again over the  way they had come, to spend a few more hours in skylarking and splashing  about in the sea.      [Illustration: Fig. 47. DIVING FLAT INTO SHALLOW WATER (Page 83)]    In speaking of these games of the penguins, I wish to lay emphasis on  the fact that these hours of relaxation play a large part in their lives  during the advanced part of the breeding period. They would spend hours  in playing at a sort of \"touch last\" on the sea-ice near the water's  edge. They never played on the ground of the rookery itself, but only on  the sea-ice and the ice-foot and in the water, and I may here mention  another favourite pastime of theirs. I have said that the tide flowed  past the rookery at the rate of some five or six knots. Small ice-floes  are continually drifting past in the water, and as one of these arrived  at the top of the ice-foot, it would be boarded by a crowd of penguins,  sometimes until it could hold no more. (Fig. 39.) This \"excursion boat,\"  as we used to call it, would float its many occupants down the whole  length of the ice-foot, and if it passed close to the edge, those that  rode on the floes would shout at the knots of penguins gathered along  the ice-foot (Fig. 40) who would shout at them in reply, so that a gay  bantering seemed to accompany their passage past the rookery.    Arrived at the farther end, some half a mile lower down, those on the  \"excursion boat\" had perforce to leave it, all plunging into the tide  and swimming against this until they came to the top again, then boarded  a fresh floe for another ride down. All day these floes, often crowded  to their utmost capacity, would float past the rookery. Often a knot of  hesitating penguins on the ice-foot, on being hailed by a babel of  voices from a floe, would suddenly make the plunge, and all swim off to  join their friends for the rest of the journey, and I have seen a floe  so crowded that as a fresh party boarded it on one side, many were  pushed off the other side into the water by the crush.    Once, as we stood watching the penguins bathing, one of them popped out  of the water on to the ice with a large pebble in its mouth, which it  had evidently fetched from the bottom. This surprised me, as the depth  of the sea here was some ten fathoms at least. The bird simply dropped  the stone on the ice and then dived in again, so that evidently he had  gone to all the trouble of diving for the stone simply for the pleasure  of doing it. Mr. J. H. Gurney, in his book on the gannet, says they  (gannets) are said to have got themselves entangled in fishing-nets at a  depth of 180 ft. and that their descent to a depth of 90 ft. is quite  authentic, so that perhaps the depth of this penguin's dive was not an  unusual one.      [Illustration: Fig. 48. Diving Flat]      [Illustration: Fig. 49. Adelies \"Porpoising\" (Page 80)]    The tide at the open water leads where they bathed ran a good six knots,  but the Adelies swam quite easily against this without leaving the  surface.    In the water, as on the land, they have two means of progression. The  first is by swimming as a duck swims, excepting that they lie much lower  in the water than a duck does, the top of the back being submerged, so  that the neck sticks up out of the water. As their feet are very  slightly webbed, they have not the advantages that a duck or gull has  when swimming in this way, but supplement their foot-work by short quick  strokes of their flippers. This they are easily able to do, owing to the  depth to which the breast sinks in the water.    The second method is by \"porpoising.\"    This consists in swimming under water, using the wings or \"flippers\" for  propulsion, the action of these limbs being practically the same as they  would be in flying. As their wings are beautifully shaped for swimming,  and their pectoral muscles extraordinarily powerful, they attain great  speed, besides which they are as nimble as fish, being able completely  to double in their tracks in the flash of a moment. In porpoising, after  travelling thirty feet or so under water, they rise from it, shooting  clean out with an impetus that carries them a couple of yards in the  air, then with an arch of the back they are head first into the water  again, swimming a few more strokes, then out again, and so on.    I show a photograph of them doing this (Fig. 49).    Perhaps the most surprising feat of which the Adelie is capable is seen  when it leaps from the water on to the ice. We saw this best later in  the year when the sea-ice had broken away from the ice-foot, so that  open water washed against the ice cliff bounding the land. This little  cliff rose sheer from the water at first, but later, by the action of  the waves, was under-cut for some six feet or more in places, so that  the ledge of ice at the top hung forwards over the water. The height of  most of this upper ledge varied from three to six feet.      [Illustration: Fig. "]]]
