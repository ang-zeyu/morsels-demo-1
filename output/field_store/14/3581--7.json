The blood being brought back from all parts of the body into the  right auricle of the heart, distends this cavity, and thus causes it  to contract; this auricle, by contracting, forces the blood into the  right ventricle; this muscular cavity being distended and irritated  by the blood, contracts, and propels the blood through the pulmonary  artery into the lungs: from hence it is brought back by the pulmonary  veins, to the left auricle of the heart, by whose contraction it is  forced into the left ventricle. The contraction of this ventricle  propels the blood, with great force, into the aorta, through the  innumerable ramifications of which, it is carried to every part of  the body, and brought back by veins, which accompany these arterial  ramifications, and form the venae cavae, which conduct the blood into  the right auricle of the heart, from whence it is again sent into the  right ventricle, which sends it through the pulmonary artery, to the  lungs; the pulmonary veins bring it back again to the heart, from  whence it is propelled through the aorta, to all parts of the body:  thus running a perpetual round, called the circulation of the blood.    Thus then we see, that the circulation consists of two circles or  stages, one through the lungs, which may be called the pulmonary, or  lesser circle, and the other through all parts of the body, which may  be termed the aortal, or greater circle.    That the blood circulates in this manner, is evident, from the valves  placed at the origin of the arteries, and in the large branches of  the veins, which prevent the return of the blood to the heart, in any  other manner than that I have described. This is likewise evident, in  the common operation of blood letting: when the arm is tied, the vein  swells below the ligature, instead of above, and we do not make the  opening above the ligature, or on the side next the heart. If the  vein were opened above the ligature, it would not bleed. For it only  swells next the hand, which shows that the blood does not flow into  the vein downwards from the heart, but upwards from the hand.    If the ligature be too tight, the blood will not flow through the  opening in the vein. The reason of this, is, that the artery is  compressed, in this case, as well as the vein; and as the veins  derive their blood from the arteries, it follows that if the blood's  motion be obstructed in the latter, none can flow from them into the  former: when we wish to open an artery, the orifice must be made  above the ligature.    Another proof of the circulation being performed in this manner, is  derived from microscopic observations, on the transparent parts of  animals, in which the blood can be seen to move towards the  extremities, along the arteries, and return by the veins.    The blood, however, does not flow out of the heart into the arteries  in a continued stream, but by jets, or pulses; when the ventricles  are filled with blood from the auricles, this blood stimulates them,  and thereby causes them to contract; by such contraction, they force  the blood, which they contain, into the arteries; this contraction is  called the systole of the heart. As soon as they have finished their  contraction, they relax, till they are again filled with blood from  the auricles, and this state of relaxation of the heart, is called  the diastole.    This causes the pulsation or beating of the heart. The arteries must,  of course, have a similar pulsation, the blood being driven into them  only by starts; and accordingly we find it in the artery of the  wrist; this beating we call the pulse; the like may also be observed  in the arteries of the temples, and other parts of the body. The  veins, however, have no pulsation, for the blood flowing on, in an  uninterrupted course, from smaller tubes to wider, its pulse becomes  entirely destroyed.    The different cavities of the heart do not contract at the same time;  but the two auricles contract together, the ventricles being at that  time in a state of relaxation; these ventricles then contract  together, while the auricles become relaxed.    Both the arteries and veins may be compared to a tree, whose trunk is  divided into large branches; these are subdivided into smaller, the  smaller again into others still smaller; and we may observe,  likewise, that the sum of the capacities of the branches, which arise  from any trunk, is always greater than the capacity of the trunk.    The minutest branches of the arteries, being reflected, become veins,  or else they enter veins that are already formed, by anastomosis, as  it is called; the small veins continually receiving others, become,  like a river, gradually larger, till they form the venae cavae, which  conduct the blood to the heart.    Anatomical injections prove, that the last branches of the arteries  terminate in the beginning of veins; but it is the opinion of many  celebrated physiologists, that the arteries carry the blood to the  different parts of the body to nourish them, and that the veins  commence by open mouths, which absorb or suck up what is superfluous,  and return it back to the heart.    From what has been said, it must be evident that there is a  considerable resemblance between the circulation of the blood in the  animal body, and the circulation of the aqueous fluid on the surface  of the globe. In the latter case the water is raised from the ocean,  by the heat of the sun, and poured down upon the dry land, in minute  drops, for the nourishment and economy of its different parts. What  is superfluous is collected into little rills; these meeting with  others, form brooks; the union of which produce rivers, that conduct  the water to its original source, from which it is again circulated.    In the same manner, the blood is sent by the heart to different parts  of the body, for the nourishment and economy of its different parts;  what is superfluous is brought back by veins, which, continually  uniting, form those large trunks, which convey the vital fluid to the  heart.    The blood does not circulate, however, in the manner which I have  mentioned, in all parts of the body; for that which is carried by  arteries to the viscera, serving for digestion, such as the stomach,  bowels, mesentery, omentum, and spleen, is collected by small veins  which unite into a large trunk called the vena portarum; this vein  enters the liver, and is subdivided in it like an artery,  distributing through the liver a great quantity of blood, from which  the bile is secreted: and, having served this purpose, the blood is  collected by small veins; these unite and form the hepatic vein,  which pours the blood into the vena cava, to be conducted to the  heart.    The reason of this deviation, is probably, to diminish the velocity  of the blood in the liver, for the secretion of the bile; which could  not have been effected by means of an artery.    The force which impels the blood, is, first, the contraction of the  heart, which propels the blood into the arteries with great velocity;  but this is not the only force concerned in keeping up the  circulation; this is evident, from the diminished heat, and weakened  pulse, in a paralytic limb, which ought not to take place, if the  blood were propelled merely by the action of the heart.    The arteries are possessed of an elastic and muscular power, by means  of which they contract when they are distended or stimulated. It is  however by the muscular power alone, that they assist in propelling  the blood; for the elasticity of their coats can serve no other  purpose than preserving the mean diameter of the vessel. If we  suppose the arteries to be dilated by the blood, poured into them by  the heart, they will, by their contraction, as elastic tubes,  undoubtedly propel the blood: but supposing them to be perfectly  elastic, the force of the heart will be just as much diminished in  dilating them as the force of the blood is increased by their  contraction. We are not however acquainted with any substance  perfectly elastic, or which restores itself with a force equal to  that with which it was distended: hence the elastic power of the  arteries will subtract from, instead of adding to, the power of the  heart. It is evident, therefore, that it must be by the muscular  power of the arteries, which causes them to contract like the heart,  that they propel the blood.    That such is the case, appears from the muscular structure of the  arteries observed by anatomists; as also from the effects of  mechanical irritation of their coats, which causes them to contract;  this is likewise evident from the inflammation produced by the  application of stimulating substances to particular parts; for  instance, cantharides and mustard. It appears likewise, from the  secretion in some parts being preternaturally increased, while the  motion of the general mass of the blood continues unaltered.    The contraction of the arteries always propels the blood towards the  extreme parts of the body: this must necessarily happen, because the  valves at the origin of the arteries prevent its return to the heart,  it must therefore move in the direction in which it finds least  resistance.    If it were not for this muscular power of the arteries, the force of  the heart would not alone be able to propel the blood to the extreme  parts of the body, and overcome the different kinds of resistance it  has to encounter. Among the causes that lessen the velocity of the  blood, may be mentioned the increasing area of the artery; for it was  before observed, that the sum of the cavities of the branches from  any trunk exceeded the cavity of the trunk: and from the principles  of hydrostatics, the velocities of fluids, propelled by the same  force, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#11)"],[1,"galactase  which has the property of decomposing hydrogen peroxid.

Under the conditions in which milk is drawn, it is practically  impossible to secure the same without bacterial contamination. The  result of the introduction of these organisms often changes its  character materially as most bacteria cause the production of more or  less pronounced fermentative processes. Under normal conditions, milk  sours, i. e., develops lactic acid, but at times this more common  fermentation may be replaced by other changes which are marked by the  production of some other more or less undesirable flavor, odor or change  in appearance.    In referring to these changes, it is usually customary to designate them  after the most prominent by-product formed, but it must be kept in mind  that generally some other decomposition products are usually produced.  Whether the organisms producing this or that series of changes prevail  or not depends upon the initial seeding, and the conditions under which  the milk is kept. Ordinarily, the lactic acid organisms grow so  luxuriantly in the milk that they overpower all competitors and so  determine the nature of the fermentation; but occasionally the milk  becomes infected with other types of bacteria in relatively large  numbers and the conditions may be especially suitable to the development  of these forms, thereby modifying the course of the normal changes that  occur.    The kinds of bacteria that find it possible to develop in milk may be  included under two heads:    1. Those which cause no appreciable change in the milk, either in taste,  odor or appearance. While these are frequently designated as the inert  bacteria, it must not be supposed that they have absolutely no effect on  milk. It is probably true in most cases that slight changes of a  chemical nature are produced, but the nature of the changes do not  permit of ready recognition.    2. This class embraces all those organisms which, as a result of their  growth, are capable of producing evident changes. These transformations  may be such as to affect the taste, as in the sour milk or in the bitter  fermentations, or the odor, as in some of the fetid changes, or the  appearance of the milk, as in the slimy and color changes later  described.    ~Souring of milk.~ Ordinarily if milk is allowed to stand for several days  at ordinary temperatures it turns sour. This is due to the formation of  lactic acid, which is produced by the decomposition of the milk-sugar.  While this change is well nigh universal, it does not occur without a  pre-existing cause, and that is the presence of certain living bacterial  forms. These organisms develop in milk with great rapidity, and the  decomposition changes that are noted in souring are due to the  by-products of their development.    The milk-sugar undergoes fermentation, the chief product being lactic  acid, although various other by-products, as other organic acids  (acetic, formic and succinic), different alcohols and gaseous products,  as CO_{2}, H, N and methane (CH_{4}) are produced in small amounts.    In this fermentation, the acidity begins to be evident to the taste when  it reaches about 0.3 per cent., calculated as lactic acid. As the  formation of acid goes on, the casein is precipitated and incipient  curdling or lobbering of the milk occurs. This begins to be apparent  when the acidity is about 0.4 per cent., but the curd becomes more solid  with increasing acidity. The rapidity of curdling is also dependent upon  the temperature of the milk. Thus milk which at ordinary temperatures  might remain fluid often curdles when heated. The growth of the bacteria  is continued until about 0.8 to 1.0 per cent. acid is formed, although  the maximum amount fluctuates considerably with different lactic acid  species. Further formation then ceases even though all of the milk-sugar  is not used up, because of the inability of the lactic bacteria to  continue their growth in such acid solutions.    As this acidity is really in the milk serum, cream never develops so  much acid as milk, because a larger proportion of its volume is made up  of butter-fat globules. This fact must be considered in the ripening of  cream in butter-making where the per cent. of fat is subject to wide  fluctuations.    The formation of lactic acid is a characteristic that is possessed by a  large number of bacteria, micrococci as well as bacilli being numerously  represented. Still the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the view  that a few types are responsible for most of these changes. The most  common type found in spontaneously soured milk changes the milk-sugar  into lactic acid without the production of any gas. This type has been  described by various workers on European as well as American milks, and  is designated by Conn as the _Bact. lactis acidi_ type.[51] It is  subject to considerable variation under different conditions.    Curiously enough if milk which has been drawn with special care is  examined immediately after milking, the lactic organisms are not usually  found. They are incapable of development in the udder itself, as shown  by injections into the milk cistern. They abound, however, on hay, in  dust, in the barn air, on the hairy coat of the animal, and from these  sources easily gain access to the milk. In this medium they find an  exceptionally favorable environment and soon begin a very rapid growth,  so that by the time milk is consumed, either in the form of milk or milk  products, they make up numerically the larger portion of the bacteria  present.    Another widely disseminated, although numerically less prevalent, type  is _B. lactis aerogenes_. This type forms gas in milk so that the soured  milk is torn by the presence of gas bubbles. It also grows more  luxuriantly in contact with the air.    Other types occur more or less"]]]
