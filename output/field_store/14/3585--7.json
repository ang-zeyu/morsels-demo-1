You shall go with me and see mamma,  and if you like you can stay with her.\"    \"I should like to go and see her and Baby Josy, but I'd rather come  back, please. Demi would miss me, and I love to be here, Aunty.\"    \"You can't get on without your Demi, can you?\" and Aunt Jo looked as if  she quite understood the love of the little girl for her only brother.    \"'Course I can't; we're twins, and so we love each other more than other  people,\" answered Daisy, with a brightening face, for she considered  being a twin one of the highest honors she could ever receive.    \"Now, what will you do with your little self while I fly around?\" asked  Mrs. Bhaer, who was whisking piles of linen into a wardrobe with great  rapidity.    \"I don't know, I'm tired of dolls and things; I wish you'd make up a new  play for me, Aunty Jo,\" said Daisy, swinging listlessly on the door.    \"I shall have to think of a brand new one, and it will take me some  time; so suppose you go down and see what Asia has got for your lunch,\"  suggested Mrs. Bhaer, thinking that would be a good way in which to  dispose of the little hindrance for a time.    \"Yes, I think I'd like that, if she isn't cross,\" and Daisy slowly  departed to the kitchen, where Asia, the black cook, reigned  undisturbed.    In five minutes, Daisy was back again, with a wide-awake face, a bit of  dough in her hand and a dab of flour on her little nose.    \"Oh aunty! Please could I go and make gingersnaps and things? Asia isn't  cross, and she says I may, and it would be such fun, please do,\" cried  Daisy, all in one breath.    \"Just the thing, go and welcome, make what you like, and stay as long as  you please,\" answered Mrs. Bhaer, much relieved, for sometimes the one  little girl was harder to amuse than the dozen boys.    Daisy ran off, and while she worked, Aunt Jo racked her brain for a  new play. All of a sudden she seemed to have an idea, for she smiled  to herself, slammed the doors of the wardrobe, and walked briskly away,  saying, \"I'll do it, if it's a possible thing!\"    What it was no one found out that day, but Aunt Jo's eyes twinkled so  when she told Daisy she had thought of a new play, and was going to buy  it, that Daisy was much excited and asked questions all the way into  town, without getting answers that told her anything. She was left at  home to play with the new baby, and delight her mother's eyes, while  Aunt Jo went off shopping. When she came back with all sorts of queer  parcels in corners of the carry-all, Daisy was so full of curiosity that  she wanted to go back to Plumfield at once. But her aunt would not be  hurried, and made a long call in mamma's room, sitting on the floor with  baby in her lap, making Mrs. Brooke laugh at the pranks of the boys, and  all sorts of droll nonsense.    How her aunt told the secret Daisy could not imagine, but her mother  evidently knew it, for she said, as she tied on the little bonnet and  kissed the rosy little face inside, \"Be a good child, my Daisy, and  learn the nice new play aunty has got for you. It's a most useful and  interesting one, and it is very kind of her to play it with you, because  she does not like it very well herself.\"    This last speech made the two ladies laugh heartily, and increased  Daisy's bewilderment. As they drove away something rattled in the back  of the carriage.    \"What's that?\" asked Daisy, pricking up her ears.    \"The new play,\" answered Mrs. Jo, solemnly.    \"What is it made of?\" cried Daisy.    \"Iron, tin, wood, brass, sugar, salt, coal, and a hundred other things.\"    \"How strange! What color is it?\"    \"All sorts of colors.\"    \"Is it large?\"    \"Part of it is, and a part isn't.\"    \"Did I ever see one?\"    \"Ever so many, but never one so nice as this.\"    \"Oh! what can it be? I can't wait. When shall I see it?\" and Daisy  bounced up and down with impatience.    \"To-morrow morning, after lessons.\"    \"Is it for the boys, too?\"    \"No, all for you and Bess. The boys will like to see it, and want to  play one part of it. But you can do as you like about letting them.\"    \"I'll let Demi, if he wants to.\"    \"No fear that they won't all want to, especially Stuffy,\" and Mrs.  Bhaer's eyes twinkled more than ever as she patted a queer knobby bundle  in her lap.    \"Let me feel just once,\" prayed Daisy.    \"Not a feel; you'd guess in a minute and spoil the fun.\"    Daisy groaned and then smiled all over her face, for through a little  hole in the paper she caught a glimpse of something bright.    \"How can I wait so long? Couldn't I see it today?\"    \"Oh dear, no! It has got to be arranged, and ever so many parts fixed in  their places. I promised Uncle Teddy that you shouldn't see it till it  was all in apple-pie order.\"    \"If uncle knows about it then it must be splendid!\" cried Daisy,  clapping her hands; for this kind, rich, jolly uncle of hers was as  good as a fairy godmother to the children, and was always planning merry  surprises, pretty gifts, and droll amusements for them.    \"Yes; Teddy went and bought it with me, and we had such fun in the shop  choosing the different parts. He would have everything fine and large,  and my little plan got regularly splendid when he took hold. You must  give him your very best kiss when he comes, for he is the kindest uncle  that ever went and bought a charming little coo Bless me! I nearly told  you what it was!\" and Mrs. Bhaer cut that most interesting word short  off in the middle, and began to look over her bills, as if afraid she  would let the cat out of the bag if she talked any more. Daisy folded  her hands with an air of resignation, and sat quite still trying to  think what play had a \"coo\" in it.    When they got home she eyed every bundle that was taken out, and one  large heavy one, which Franz took straight upstairs and hid in the  nursery, filled her with amazement and curiosity. Something very  mysterious went on up there that afternoon, for Franz was hammering,  and Asia trotting up and down, and Aunt Jo flying around like a  will-o'-the-wisp, with all sort of things under her apron, while little  Ted, who was the only child admitted, because he couldn't talk plain,  babbled and laughed, and tried to tell what the \"sumpin pitty\" was.    All this made Daisy half-wild, and her excitement spread among the boys,  who quite overwhelmed Mother Bhaer with offers of assistance, which she  declined by quoting their own words to Daisy:    \"Girls can't play with boys. This is for Daisy, and Bess, and me, so  we don't want you.\" Whereupon the young gentlemen meekly retired, and  invited Daisy to a game of marbles, horse, football, anything she liked,  with a sudden warmth and politeness which astonished her innocent little  soul.    Thanks to these attentions, she got through the afternoon, went early  to bed, and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made Uncle  Fritz wish that a new game could be invented every day. Quite a thrill  pervaded the school-room when Daisy was dismissed at eleven o'clock,  for everyone knew that now she was going to have the new and mysterious  play.    Many eyes followed her as she ran away, and Demi's mind was so  distracted by this event that when Franz asked him where the desert  of Sahara was, he mournfully replied, \"In the nursery,\" and the whole  school laughed at him.    \"Aunt Jo, I've done all my lessons, and I can't wait one single minute  more!\" cried Daisy, flying into Mrs. Bhaer's room.    \"It's all ready, come on;\" and tucking Ted under one arm, and her  workbasket under the other, Aunt Jo promptly led the way upstairs.    \"I don't see anything,\" said Daisy, staring about her as she got inside  the nursery door.    \"Do you hear anything?\" asked Aunt Jo, catching Ted back by his little  frock as he was making straight for one side of the room.    Daisy did hear an odd crackling, and then a purry little sound as of a  kettle singing. These noises came from behind a curtain drawn before a  deep bay window. Daisy snatched it back, gave one joyful, \"Oh!\" and then  stood gazing with delight at what do you think?    A wide seat ran round the three sides of the window; on one side hung  and stood all sorts of little pots and pans, gridirons and skillets;  on the other side a small dinner and tea set; and on the middle part a  cooking-stove. Not a tin one, that was of no use, but a real iron stove,  big enough to cook for a large family of very hungry dolls. But the best  of it was that a real fire burned in it, real steam came out of the  nose of the little tea-kettle, and the lid of the little boiler actually  danced a jig, the water inside bubbled so hard. A pane of glass had  been taken out and replaced by a sheet of tin, with a hole for the small  funnel, and real smoke went sailing away outside so naturally, that it  did one's heart good to see it. The box of wood with a hod of charcoal  stood near by; just above hung dust-pan, brush and broom; a little  market basket was on the low table at which Daisy used to play, and over  the back of her little chair hung a white apron with a bib, and a droll  mob cap. The sun shone in as if he enjoyed the fun, the little stove  roared beautifully, the kettle steamed, the new tins sparkled on the  walls, the pretty china stood in tempting rows, and it was altogether as  cheery and complete a kitchen as any child could desire.    Daisy stood quite still after the first glad \"Oh!\" but her eyes went  quickly from one charming object to another, brightening as they looked,  till they came to Aunt Jo's merry face; there they stopped as the happy  little girl hugged her, saying gratefully:    \"Oh aunty, it's a splendid new play! Can I really cook at the dear  stove, and have parties and mess, and sweep, and make fires that truly  burn? I like it so much! What made you think of it?\"    \"Your liking to make gingersnaps with Asia made me think of it,\" said  Mrs. Bhaer, holding Daisy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#11)"],[1,"addler, and my partner in charge of the only gun. In half an hour we  reached a lonely lake surrounded by swamps, and woods of mixed timber.  The sunset red was purpling all the horizon belt of pines, and the peace  of the still hour was on lake and swamp. With some little sense of  profanity I raised the hoodoo horn to my mouth, gave one or two  high-pitched, impatient grunts, then poured forth the softly rising,  long-drawn love-call of a cow Moose, all alone, and \"Oh, so lonesome.\"    The guide nodded in approval, \"That's all right,\" then I took out my  watch and waited for fifteen minutes. For, strange to tell, it seems to  repel the bull Moose and alarm him if the cow seems over-eager. There is  a certain etiquette to be observed; it is easy to spoil all by trying to  go too fast. And it does not do to guess at the time; when one is  waiting so hard, the minute is like twenty.    So when fifteen minutes really had gone, I raised the magic horn again,  emitted a few hankering whines, then broke into a louder, farther  reaching call that thrilled up echoes from across the lake and seemed to  fill the woods for miles around with its mellifluous pleading.    Again I waited and gave a third call just as the sun was gone. Then we  strained our eyes and watched at every line of woods, and still were  watching when the sound of a falling tree was heard far off on a  hillside.    Then there was a sort of after-clap as though the tree had lodged the  first time, and hanging half a minute, had completed its fall with  breaking of many branches, and a muffled crash. We gazed hard that way,  and the guide, a very young one, whispered, \"Bear!\"    There was silence, then a stick broke nearer, and a deep, slow snort was  heard; it might have been the \"woof\" of a Bear, but I was in doubt. Then  without any more noises, a white array of shining antler tips appeared  above the near willows, and swiftly, silently, there glided into view a  huge bull Moose.    \"How solid and beefy he looks!\" was my first thought. He \"woofed\" again,  and the guide, with an eye always to the head, whispered to my partner:  \"Take him! he's a stunner.\"    Striding on he came, with wonderful directness, seeing I had not called  for twenty minutes, and that when he was a mile or more away.    As he approached within forty yards, the guide whispered, \"Now is your  chance. You'll never get a better one.\" My partner whispered, \"Steady  the canoe.\" I drove my paddle point into the sandy bottom, the guide did  the same at the other end, and she arose standing in the canoe and  aimed. Then came the wicked \"crack\" of the rifle, the \"pat\" of the  bullet, the snort and whirl of the great, gray, looming brute, and a  second shot as he reached the willows, only to go down with a crash, and  sob his life out on the ground behind the leafy screen.    It all seemed so natural, so exactly according to the correct rules of  sporting books and tales, and yet so unlovely.    There were tears in the eyes of the fair killer, and heart wrenches were  hers, as the great sobs grew less and ceased; and a different sob was  heard at my elbow, as we stood beside the biggest Moose that had been  killed there in years. It was triumph I suppose; it is a proud thing to  act a lie so cleverly; the Florentine assassins often decoyed and  trapped a brave man, by crying like a woman. But I have never called a  Moose since, and that rifle has hung unused in its rack from that to the  present day.    [Illustration]      THE BIGGEST OF OUR GAME--THE BUFFALO    \"Yes, that's a buffalo-bird,\" said the old Indian, pointing to some  black birds, with gray mates, that flitted or ran across the plain.  \"Pretty bad luck when the Buffalo gone. Them little birds make their  nest in a Buffalo's wool, right on his head, and when the Buffalo all  gone, seem like the buffalo-bird die too; 'cause what's the use, no got  any nest.\"    This is a fragment that reached me long ago in Montana. It seemed like a  lusty myth, whose succulent and searching roots were in a bottomless  bog, with little chance of sound foundation. But the tale bore the  searchlight better than I thought. For it seems that the buffalo-bird  followed the Buffalo everywhere, and was fond of nesting, not in the  shaggy mane between the horns of the ruling monarch, but on any huge  head it might find after the bull had fallen, and the skull, with mane  attached, lay discarded on the plain. While always, even when nesting on  the ground, the wool of the Buffalo was probably used as lining of the  black-bird's nest. I know of one case where an attendant bird that was  too crippled to fly when autumn came, wintered in the mane of a large  Buffalo bull. It gathered seed by day, when the bull pawed up the snow,  and roosted at night between the mighty horns, snuggling in the wool,  with its toes held warm against the monster's blood-hot neck.    In most of the Northwest the birds have found a poor substitute for the  Buffalo in the range-cattle, but oh! how they must miss the wool.    [Illustration: XVIII. Moose--the Widow  _Drawing by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: XIX. Buffalo Groups (a) Bull and Cow at Banff; (b)  Yellowstone Bulls    _Photos by G. G. Seton_]      THE SHRUNKEN RANGE    It is not generally known that the American Buffalo ranged as far east  as Syracuse, Washington City, and Carolina, that they populated the  forests in small numbers, as well as the plains in great herds. I  estimate them at over 50,000,000 in A.D. 1500. In 1895 they were down to  800; probably this was the low-ebb year. Since then they have increased  under judicious protection, and now reach about 3,000.    In the June of 1897, as I stood on a hill near Baronett's Bridge,  overlooking the Yellowstone just beyond Yancey's, with an old timer,  Dave Roberts, he said: \"Twenty years ago, when I first saw this valley,  it was black-speckled with Buffalo, and every valley in the Park was the  same.\" Now the only sign of the species was a couple of old skulls  crumbling in the grass.    In 1900 the remnant in the Park had fallen to thirty, and their  extinction seemed certain. But the matter was taken up energetically by  the officers in charge. Protection, formerly a legal fiction, was made  an accomplished fact. The Buffalo have increased ever since, and to-day  number 200, with the possibility of some stragglers.    We need not dwell on the story of the extinction of the great herds.  That is familiar to all,[B] but it is well to remind the reader that it  was inevitable. The land was, or would be, needed for human settlement,  with which the Buffalo herds were incompatible; only we brought it on  forty or fifty years before it was necessary. \"Could we not save the  Buffalo as range-cattle?\" is the question that most ask. The answer is:  It has been tried a hundred times and all attempts have been eventually  frustrated by the creature's temper. Buffalo, male or female, are always  more or less dangerous; they cannot be tamed or trusted. They are always  subject to stampede, and once started, nothing, not even sure  destruction, stops them; so in spite of their suitability to the  climate, their hardihood, their delicious meat, and their valuable  robes, the attempts at domesticating the Buffalo have not yet been made  a success.    [Illustration]    A small herd of a dozen or so is kept in a fenced range near the Mammoth  Hot Springs, where the traveller should not fail to try for pictures,  and with them he will see the cowbirds, that in some regions replace the  true buffalo-birds. Perched on their backs or heads or running around  them on the ground are these cattle birds as of yore, like boats around  a man-o'-war, or sea-gulls around a whale; living their lives, snapping  up the tormenting flies, and getting in return complete protection from  every creature big enough to seem a menace in the eyes of the old time  King of the Plains.      THE DOOMED ANTELOPE AND HIS HELIOGRAPH    The Antelope, or Pronghorn, is one of the most peculiar animals in the  world. It is the only known ruminant that has hollow horns on a bony  core as with cattle, and also has them branched and shed each year as in  the Deer.    It is a creature of strangely mixed characteristics, for it has the feet  of a Giraffe, the glands of a goat, the coat of a Deer, the horns of an  ox and Deer combined, the eyes of a Gazelle, the build of an Antelope,  and--the speed of the wind. It is the swiftest four-footed creature  native to the plains, and so far as known there is nothing but a blooded  race horse that can outrun it on a mile.    But the peculiarity that is most likely to catch the eye of the  traveller is the white disc on its rear.    [Illustration: The Heliograph]    The first day I was in the Yellowstone I was riding along the upland  beyond Blacktail Creek with T. E. Hofer. Miles away to the southeast we  saw some white specks showing, flashing and disappearing. Then as far to  the northeasterly we saw others. Hofer now remarked, \"Two bunches of  Antelope.\" Then later there were flashes _between_ and we knew that  these two bands had come together. How?    When you have a chance in a zoo or elsewhere to watch Antelope at short  range you will see the cause of these flashes. By means of a circular  muscle on each buttock they can erect the white hair of the rump patch  into a large, flat, snow-white disc which shines in the sun, and  shows afar as a bright white spot.    [Illustration: XX. Near Yellowstone Gate: (a) Antelope _Photo by F. Jay  Haynes_  (b) Captive Wolf _Photo by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: XXI. Mountain Sheep on Mt. Evarts  _Photo by E. T. Seton_]    This action is momentary or very brief; the spread disc goes down again  in a few seconds. The flash is usually a signal of danger, although it  answers equally well for a recognition mark.    In 1897 the Antelope in the Park were estimated at 1,500. Now they have  dwindled to about one third of that, and,"]]]
