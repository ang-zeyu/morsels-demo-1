The second stage is the growing  tree, the chrysalis, the man. The third is the splendid pine, the  butterfly, the angel. Difference of stage is the cause of difference of  development. So it is among men, and among the races of men.    16. Through perfectly concentrated Meditation on the three stages of  development comes a knowledge of past and future.    We have taken our illustrations from natural science, because, since  every true discovery in natural science is a divination of a law in  nature, attained through a flash of genius, such discoveries really  represent acts of spiritual perception, acts of perception by the  spiritual man, even though they are generally not so recognized. So  we may once more use the same illustration. Perfectly concentrated  Meditation, perfect insight into the chrysalis, reveals the caterpillar  that it has been, the butterfly that it is destined to be. He who knows  the seed, knows the seed-pod or ear it has come from, and the plant  that is to come from it. So in like manner he who really knows today,  and the heart of to-day, knows its parent yesterday and its child  tomorrow. Past, present and future are all in the Eternal. He who  dwells in the Eternal knows all three.    17. The sound and the object and the thought called up by a word are  confounded because they are all blurred together in the mind. By  perfectly concentrated Meditation on the distinction between them,  there comes an understanding of the sounds uttered by all beings.    It must be remembered that we are speaking of perception by the  spiritual man.    Sound, like every force, is the expression of a power of the Eternal.  Infinite shades of this power are expressed in the infinitely varied  tones of sound. He who, having entry to the consciousness of the  Eternal knows the essence of this power, can divine the meanings of  all sounds, from the voice of the insect to the music of the spheres.    In like manner, he who has attained to spiritual vision can perceive the  mind-images in the thoughts of others, with the shade of feeling which  goes with them, thus reading their thoughts as easily as he hears their  words. Every one has the germ of this power, since difference of tone  will give widely differing meanings to the same words, meanings  which are intuitively perceived by everyone.    18. When the mind-impressions become visible, there comes an  understanding of previous births.    This is simple enough if we grasp the truth of rebirth. The fine harvest  of past experiences is drawn into the spiritual nature, forming, indeed,  the basis of its development. When the consciousness has been raised  to a point above these fine subjective impressions, and can look down  upon them from above, this will in itself be a remembering of past  births.    19. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on mind-images is gained  the understanding of the thoughts of others.    Here, for those who can profit by it, is the secret of thought-reading.  Take the simplest case of intentional thought transference. It is the  testimony of those who have done this, that the perceiving mind must  be stilled, before the mind-image projected by the other mind can be  seen. With it comes a sense of the feeling and temper of the other  mind and so on, in higher degrees.    20. But since that on which the thought in the mind of another rests  is not objective to the thought-reader's consciousness, he perceives the  thought only, and not also that on which the thought rests.    The meaning appears to be simple: One may be able to perceive the  thoughts of some one at a distance; one cannot, by that means alone,  also perceive the external surroundings of that person, which arouse  these thoughts.    21. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the form of the body, by  arresting the body's perceptibility, and by inhibiting the eye's power of  sight, there comes the power to make the body invisible.    There are many instances of the exercise of this power, by mesmerists,  hypnotists and the like; and we may simply call it an instance of the  power of suggestion. Shankara tells us that by this power the popular  magicians of the East perform their wonders, working on the  mind-images of others, while remaining invisible themselves. It is all  a question of being able to see and control the mind-images.    22. The works which fill out the life-span may be either immediately  or gradually operative. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on these  comes a knowledge of the time of the end, as also through signs.    A garment which is wet, says the commentator, may be hung up to  dry, and so dry rapidly, or it may be rolled in a ball and dry slowly; so  a fire may blaze or smoulder. Thus it is with Karma, the works that fill  out the life-span. By an insight into the mental forms and forces which  make up Karma, there comes a knowledge of the rapidity or slowness  of their development, and of the time when the debt will be paid.    23. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on sympathy, compassion  and kindness, is gained the power of interior union with others.    Unity is the reality; separateness the illusion. The nearer we come to  reality, the nearer we come to unity of heart. Sympathy, compassion,  kindness are modes of this unity of heart, whereby we rejoice with  those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. These things are  learned by desiring to learn them.    24. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on power, even such power  as that of the elephant may be gained.    This is a pretty image. Elephants possess not only force, but poise and  fineness of control. They can lift a straw, a child, a tree with perfectly  judged control and effort. So the simile is a good one. By detachment,  by withdrawing into the soul's reservoir of power, we can gain all  these, force and fineness and poise; the ability to handle with equal  mastery things small and great, concrete and abstract alike.    25. By bending upon them the awakened inner light, there comes a  knowledge of things subtle, or concealed, or obscure.    As was said at the outset, each consciousness is related to all  consciousness; and, through it, has a potential consciousness of all  things; whether subtle or concealed or obscure. An understanding of  this great truth will come with practice. As one of the wise has said,  we have no conception of the power of Meditation.    26. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the sun comes a  knowledge of the worlds.    This has several meanings: First, by a knowledge of the constitution  of the sun, astronomers can understand the kindred nature of the stars.  And it is said that there is a finer astronomy, where the spiritual man  is the astronomer. But the sun also means the Soul, and through  knowledge of the Soul comes a knowledge of the realms of life.    27. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the moon comes a  knowledge of the lunar mansions.    Here again are different meanings. The moon is, first, the companion  planet, which, each day, passes backward through one mansion of the  stars. By watching the moon, the boundaries of the mansion are  learned, with their succession in the great time-dial of the sky. But the  moon also symbolizes the analytic mind, with its divided realms; and  these, too, may be understood through perfectly concentrated  Meditation.    28. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the fixed pole-star comes  a knowledge of the motions of the stars.    Addressing Duty, stern daughter of the Voice of God, Wordsworth  finely said:         Thou cost preserve the stars from wrong,       And the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong--    thus suggesting a profound relation between the moral powers and the  powers that rule the worlds. So in this Sutra the fixed polestar is the  eternal spirit about which all things move, as well as the star toward  which points the axis of the earth. Deep mysteries attend both, and the  veil of mystery is only to be raised by Meditation, by open-eyed vision  of the awakened spiritual man.    29. Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the  lower trunk brings an understanding of the order of the bodily powers.  We are coming to a vitally important part of the teaching of Yoga:  namely, the spiritual man's attainment of full self-consciousness, the  awakening of the spiritual man as a self-conscious individual, behind  and above the natural man. In this awakening, and in the process of  gestation which precedes it, there is a close relation with the powers  of the natural man, which are, in a certain sense, the projection,  outward and downward, of the powers of the spiritual man. This is  notably true of that creative power of the spiritual man which, when  embodied in the natural man, becomes the power of generation. Not  only is this power the cause of the continuance of the bodily race of  mankind, but further, in the individual, it is the key to the dominance  of the personal life. Rising, as it were, through the life-channels of the  body, it flushes the personality with physical force, and maintains and  colours the illusion that the physical life is the dominant and  all-important expression of life. In due time, when the spiritual man  has begun to take form, the creative force will be drawn off, and  become operative in building the body of the spiritual man, just as it  has been operative in the building of physical bodies, through  generation in the natural world.    Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the nature of this force means,  first, that rising of the consciousness into the spiritual world, already  described, which gives the one sure foothold for Meditation; and then,  from that spiritual point of vantage, not only an insight into the  creative force, in its spiritual and physical aspects, but also a gradually  attained control of this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#11)"],[1," remarkable as the man  himself--and a few mutilated remains. Even Colet's is gone.    Before descending to the Crypt we may remark that the Interior must  have fully emphasised the sense of majestic beauty produced by the  Exterior. The long perspective eastward from the West Door, flanked on  either side by the arcading and terminating with a glimpse of the rose  window over the choir screen, as depicted in Dugdale, leaves nothing  to be desired.    =The Crypt or Shrouds.=--The crypt was underneath the eight eastern  bays of the choir, and was about 170 feet in length.[48] The entrance  was from the churchyard on the north side, and the gloom was lit up by  basement windows both at the sides and east end. An additional row of  piers down the centre supported the choir pavement above; and the  whole undercroft may best be described as of eight arches in length  and four in breadth, the arches springing from engaged columns and the  vaulting quadripartite.    The mouldings of the clustered columns were plain rounds and hollows,  and everything throughout appears to have been uniform and of the same  date. The four western bays, rather more than half, formed the parish  church of St. Faith; the eastern part the Jesus Chapel, which, after  the suppression of the Guild, was added to St. Faith's. These two  parts were separated by a wooden screen, and over the door was an  image of Jesus, and underneath the inscription:        \"Jesus our God and Saviour      To us and ours be Gouernour.\"    These remarks about the Jesus Chapel, be it noted, date only from the  reign of Henry VI., by whom the Guild was incorporated, and the  members of which held high festival on the days of the Transfiguration  and of the Name of Jesus.    At the south-west corner of St. Faith's, but outside, was the Chapel  of St. John the Baptist, and near this were the three Chapels of St.  Anne, St. Sebastian, and St. Radegund. Dugdale gives a list of sixteen  of the more noted tombs. They include that of William Lyly, the first  master of Colet's famous foundation. Had his bones not been disturbed  by Wren's workmen, they could still have been found underneath the  arcading due south-west from Dean Milman's tomb.[49] To Lyly's memory  his son George, Prebendary of Cantlers, also placed a tablet in the  nave above.    Having mentioned our last chapel and altar, it may here be added that  the records enumerate not less than twenty chapels and three dozen  altars altogether. Besides the Guild of Jesus there were four  others--All Souls', the Annunciation, St. Catherine's, and the  Minstrels--and these do not seem to include the oldest of all, that  founded by Ralph de Diceto in 1197, which met four times a year to  celebrate the mass of the Holy Ghost. We now go on to the surrounding  buildings.      THE PRECINCTS.    =St. Gregory's=, in reality part of the cathedral with the Lollards'  Tower common to both, is mentioned as a parish church in early  documents. Pulled down and rebuilt, in the plates of Hollar it appears  as an uninteresting building, hiding from view the four west bays of  the south aisle of the nave. After the Fire the parish was united for  ecclesiastical purposes to St. Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, and  both have since been by a further union annexed to St. Martin, Ludgate  Hill. The Petty Canons were parsons or rectors--that is to say, the  income of the benefice was devoted to their support, and so continued  until their suppression as a corporation. =The Bishop's Palace= was to  the north-west, and joined the tower. We know nothing of its  architecture, and it is last mentioned in Inigo Jones' Report of 1631.    =Pardon Church Haugh=, or Pardonchirche Haw, on the north side and  east of the palace, was not a church at all, and was situated probably  in St. Gregory's parish. How the \"Haw,\" or small enclosure, received  its name is doubtful: there may have been some unrecorded connection  with pardons or indulgences. Here Thomas a Becket's father, who was  Portreeve, built his chapel, rebuilt by Dean Thomas Moore, whose  executors added three chantries. The Haugh was environed by a  cloister, and the tombs in this part traditionally exceeded, both in  number and workmanship, those in the cathedral, but this is all we  know about them. In the cloister was the picture of the Dance of  Death. Death, represented by a skeleton, leading away all sorts and  conditions of mankind, beginning with Pope and Emperor. The  accompanying verse of Dean John Lydgate, monk of Bury (or his  translation from the French), was as gruesome as the picture.  Somewhere here the Petty Canons had their common hall. Near the  cloister, and on the east side, was Walter Sheryngton's Library; and  adjacent to the north-west corner of the neighbouring transept, his  chapel with its two chantries. East of the Haugh and about opposite  the north point of the transept, was the =Charnel=, a chapel with a  warden and three chantries. Underneath was a crypt or vault for the  decent reception of any bones that might be disinterred, and hence the  name.       [Illustration: ST. PAUL'S CROSS.     _From an Engraving in Wilkinson's \"Londina Illustrata,\" after the     picture in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries,     London._]    We have now arrived at the north side of the transept, and inside the  angle formed by chancel and transept stood =Paul's Cross=, in St.  Faith's parish. It was an octagon of some thirty-seven feet, and stood  about twelve feet from the old cathedral. Mr. Penrose excavated for  the site, and found it just at the north-east angle of the present  choir. The last structure--of wood on a stone foundation, and with an  open roof--was the gift of Thomas Kemp; but a pulpit cover existed in  1241. Above the roof rose the cross from which the name was derived;  and from 1595 the whole was surrounded by a low brick wall, at the  gate of which a verger was stationed. Against the choir wall was a  gallery of two tiers: in the upper was the projecting royal box or  closet, below the Lord Mayor's; and the parishioners of St. Faith had  a right to seats. In very bad weather an adjournment was made to the  crypt; but our sturdy forefathers endured alike stress of weather,  length of discourse, and undiluted frankness of speech, after a manner  that altogether puts us, their degenerate descendants, to shame.    From a rude picture, painted in 1620 at the instance of Henry Farley,  we can see the preacher for the day with a sand-glass at his right  hand. King James, in his state box, has his Queen on his right, and  his unhappy son on his left, with the Lord Mayor below. These are to  the left of the preacher, who faces the transept. The congregation,  partly composed of parishioners of St. Faith, is seated on forms; and  the men wear their steeple-crowned hats. A dog-whipper is vigorously  belabouring a poor animal with a cat-o'-nine-tails; but the cries of  the victim do not in the least disturb either preacher or audience;  and two led horses are behind the preacher. A well-dressed youth, a  late arrival, bows and accosts a grave-looking citizen with \"I pray,  sir, what is the text?\" and the citizen answers, \"The 2nd of Chron.  xxiv.\" A second citizen is dropping a coin into a large money-box by  the transept door. The subject of the sermon, judging from the text,  was the much-needed restoration; and perchance the preacher was none  other than the diocesan, James' \"king of preachers.\"[50]    In 1633 the preaching was removed into the choir \"for the repaire of  the Church,\" though we cannot quite see in what way this could help  the repairing. Those who shortly afterwards obtained control of the  City could tolerate neither the name nor the actual cross, and were  afraid of disturbances as well. The structure came down, and although  it was said at the time only to make way for another \"fairer and  bigger,\" was never restored again. The endowments out of which the  preachers were paid went to the Sunday morning preachers, and these  latter are the legitimate successors of the old-time divines.       [Illustration: THE CHAPTER HOUSE AND CLOISTER.     _After Hollar._]    =The Clochier=, or =Bell Tower=, with its lead-covered spire crowned  with a statue of St. Paul, stood at the east end of the churchyard.  There must have been a tower here from a very early period if this was  the bell that summoned the folk-mote. The Guild of Jesus owned the  four bells of later times; and when that body was dissolved they  reverted to the Crown, and were lost at dice to a Sir Miles Partridge,  subsequently executed for sharing in the fortunes of the Protector  Somerset. The cloister of the =Chapter House=, or =Convocation House=,  shut off almost entirely the west wall of the south transept and four  bays of the south wall of the nave. This was of the unusual  arrangement of two stories, and formed a square of some ninety feet on  the plan, with seven windows in either story. This was called the  \"Lesser Cloisters,\" apparently to distinguish it from the cloister of  Pardon Church Haugh. In the centre of the square, and approached  through a vestibule from the east, was the Chapter House, an octagon  with a diameter of nearly forty feet, supported by massive buttresses.  In Dugdale's engraving the lofty roof has gone; and the tracery of  Chapter House and Cloisters alike are Perpendicular. It will be seen  there were two places for the two Houses of Convocation, one near the  west door of the nave, and this.    There was St. Peter's College, where the Petty Canons lived, Holmes  College, and the Lancaster College. Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of  Lancaster, executed for high treason against his cousin, Edward II.,  who was canonised by the people, though not by the Pope, had a tablet  somewhere in the church at which miracles were believed to be wrought,  and two offices to himself. But whether the Lancaster College referred  to him or to John of Gaunt, or where"]]]
