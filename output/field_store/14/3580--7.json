When I'm a man, Polly Pepper, I'm going to  be a minister, and have a nice time, and go--just everywhere!\"    \"Oh, Joel!\" exclaimed Polly, quite shocked; \"you couldn't be one; you  aren't good enough.\"    \"I don't care,\" said Joel, not at all dashed by her plainness, \"I'll be  good then--when I'm a big man; don't you suppose, Polly,\" as a new idea  struck him, \"that Mr. Henderson ever is naughty?\"    \"No,\" said Polly, very decidedly; \"never, never, never!\"    \"Then, I don't want to be one,\" said Joel, veering round with a sigh of  relief, \"and besides I'd rather have a pair of horses like Mr. Slocum's,  and then I could go everywheres, I guess!\"    \"And sell tin?\" asked Polly, \"just like Mr. Slocum?\"    \"Yes,\" said Joel; \"this is the way I'd go--Gee-whop! gee-whoa!\" and Joel  pranced with his imaginary steeds all around the room, making about as  much noise as any other four boys, as he brought up occasionally against  the four-poster or the high old bureau.    \"Well!\" said a voice close up by Polly's chair, that made her skip with  apprehension, it was so like Miss Jerusha Henderson's--Joel was whooping  away behind the bedstead to his horses that had become seriously  entangled, so he didn't hear anything. But when Polly said, bashfully,  \"I can't see anything, ma'am,\" he came up red and shining to the  surface, and stared with all his might.    \"I came to see you, little girl,\" said Miss Jerusha severely, seating  herself stiffly by Polly's side.    \"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Polly, faintly.    \"Who's this boy?\" asked the lady, turning around squarely on Joel, and  eying him from head to foot.    \"He's my brother Joel,\" said Polly.    Joel still stared.    \"Which brother?\" pursued Miss Jerusha, like a census-taker.    \"He is next to me,\" said Polly, wishing her mother was home; \"he's nine,  Joel is.\"    \"He's big enough to do something to help his mother,\" said Miss  Jerusha, looking him through and through. \"Don't you think you might do  something, when the others are sick, and your poor mother is working so  hard?\" she continued, in a cold voice.    \"I do something,\" blurted out Joel, sturdily, \"lots and lots!\"    \"You shouldn't say 'lots,\" reproved Miss Jerusha, with a sharp look over  her spectacles, \"tisn't proper for boys to talk so; what do you do all  day long?\" she asked, turning back to Polly, after a withering glance at  Joel, who still stared.    \"I can't do anything, ma'am,\" replied Polly, sadly, \"I can't see to do  anything.\"    \"Well, you might knit, I should think,\" said her visitor, \"it's dreadful  for a girl as big as you are to sit all day idle; I had sore eyes once  when I was a little girl--how old are you?\" she asked, abruptly.    \"Eleven last month,\" said Polly.    \"Well, I wasn't only nine when I knit a stocking; and I had sore eyes,  too; you see I was a very little girl, and--\"    \"Was you ever little?\" interrupted Joel, in extreme incredulity, drawing  near, and looking over the big square figure.    \"Hey?\" said Miss Jerusha; so Joel repeated his question before Polly  could stop him.    \"Of course,\" answered Miss Jerusha; and then she added, tartly, \"little  boys shouldn't speak unless they're spoken to. Now,\" and she turned back  to Polly again, \"didn't you ever knit a stocking?\"    \"No, ma'am,\" said Polly, \"not a whole one.\"    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Miss Jerusha; \"did I ever!\" And she raised her  black mitts in intense disdain. \"A big girl like you never to knit a  stocking! to think your mother should bring you up so! and--\"    \"She didn't bring us up,\" screamed Joel, in indignation, facing her with  blazing eyes.    \"Joel,\" said Polly, \"be still.\"    \"And you're very impertinent, too,\" said Miss Jerusha; \"a good child  never is impertinent.\"    Polly sat quite still; and Miss Jerusha continued:    \"Now, I hope you will learn to be industrious; and when I come again, I  will see what you have done.\"    \"You aren't ever coming again,\" said Joel, defiantly; \"no, never!\"    \"Joel!\" implored Polly, and in her distress she pulled up her bandage  as she looked at him; \"you know mammy'll be so sorry at you! Oh, ma'am,  and\" she turned to Miss Jerusha, who was now thoroughly aroused to the  duty she saw before her of doing these children good, \"I don't know what  is the reason, ma'am; Joel never talks so; he's real good; and--\"    \"It only shows,\" said the lady, seeing her way quite clear for a little  exhortation, \"that you've all had your own way from infancy; and that  you don't do what you might to make your mother's life a happy one.\"    \"Oh, ma'am,\" cried Polly, and she burst into a flood of tears, \"please,  please don't say that!\"    \"And I say,\" screamed Joel, stamping his small foot, \"if you make Polly  cry you'll kill her! Don't Polly, don't!\" and the boy put both arms  around her neck, and soothed and comforted her in every way he could  think of. And Miss Jerusha, seeing no way to make herself heard,  disappeared feeling pity for children who would turn away from good  advice.    But still Polly cried on; all the pent-up feelings that had been so long  controlled had free vent now. She really couldn't stop! Joel, frightened  to death, at last said, \"I'm going to wake up Ben.\"    That brought Polly to; and she sobbed out, \"Oh, no, Jo--ey--I'll stop.\"    \"I will,\" said Joel, seeing his advantage; \"I'm going, Polly,\" and he  started to the foot of the stairs.    \"No, I'm done now, Joe,\" said Polly, wiping her eyes, and choking back  her thoughts--\"oh, Joe! I must scream! my eyes aches so!\" and poor Polly  fairly writhed all over the chair.    \"What'll I do?\" said Joel, at his wits' end, running back, \"do you want  some water?\"    \"Oh, no,\" gasped Polly; \"doctor wouldn't let me; oh! I wish mammy'd  come!\"    \"I'll go and look for her,\" suggested Joel, feeling as if he must do  something; and he'd rather be out at the gate, than to see Polly suffer.    \"That won't bring her,\" said Polly; trying to keep still; \"I'll try to  wait.\"    \"Here she is now!\" cried Joel, peeping out of the window; \"oh! goody!\"          JOEL'S TURN      \"Well,\" Mrs. Pepper's tone was unusually blithe as she stepped into the  kitchen--\"you've had a nice time, I suppose--what in the world!\" and she  stopped at the bedroom door.    \"Oh, mammy, if you'd been here!\" said Joel, while Polly sat still, only  holding on to her eyes as if they were going to fly out; \"there's been  a big woman here; she came right in--and she talked awfully! and Polly's  been a-cryin', and her eyes ache dreadfully--and--\"    \"Been crying!\" repeated Mrs. Pepper, coming up to poor Polly. \"Polly  been crying!\" she still repeated.    \"Oh, mammy, I couldn't help it,\" said Polly; \"she said--\" and in spite  of all she could do, the rain of tears began again, which bade fair to  be as uncontrolled as before. But Mrs. Pepper took her up firmly in her  arms, as if she were Phronsie, and sat down in the old rocking-chair and  just patted her back.    \"There, there,\" she whispered, soothingly, \"don't think of it, Polly;  mother's got home.\"    \"Oh, mammy,\" said Polly, crawling up to the comfortable neck for  protection, \"I ought not to mind; but 'twas Miss Jerusha Henderson; and  she said--\"    \"What did she say?\" asked Mrs. Pepper, thinking perhaps it to be the  wiser thing to let Polly free her mind.    \"Oh, she said that we ought to be doing something; and I ought to knit,  and--\"    \"Go on,\" said her mother.    \"And then Joel got naughty; oh, mammy, he never did so before; and I  couldn't stop him,\" cried Polly, in great distress; \"I really couldn't,  mammy--and he talked to her; and he told her she wasn't ever coming here  again.\"    \"Joel shouldn't have said that,\" said Mrs. Pepper, and under her breath  something was added that Polly even failed to hear--\"but no more she  isn't!\"    \"And, mammy,\" cried Polly--and she flung her arms around her mother's  neck and gave her a grasp that nearly choked Mrs. Pepper, \"ain't I  helpin' you some, mammy? Oh! I wish I could do something big for you?  Ain't you happy, mammy?\"    \"For the land's sakes!\" cried Mrs. Pepper, straining Polly to her heart,  \"whatever has that woman--whatever could she have said to you? Such a  girl as you are, too!\" cried Mrs. Pepper, hugging Polly, and covering  her with kisses so tender, that Polly, warmed and cuddled up to her  heart's content, was comforted to the full.    \"Well,\" said Mrs. Pepper, when at last she thought she had formed  between Polly and Joel about the right idea of the visit, \"well, now we  won't think of it, ever any more; 'tisn't worth it, Polly, you know.\"    But poor Polly! and poor mother! They both were obliged to think of it.  Nothing could avert the suffering of the next few days, caused by that  long flow of burning tears.    \"Nothing feels good on 'em, mammy,\" said Polly, at last, twisting her  hands in the vain attempt to keep from rubbing the aching, inflamed eyes  that drove her nearly wild with their itching, \"there isn't any use in  trying anything.\"    \"There will be use,\" energetically protested Mrs. Pepper, bringing  another cool bandage, \"as long as you've got an eye in your head, Polly  Pepper!\"    Dr. Fisher's face, when he first saw the change that the fateful visit  had wrought, and heard the accounts, was very grave indeed. Everything  had been so encouraging on his last visit, that he had come very near  promising Polly speedy freedom from the hateful bandage.    But the little Pepper household soon had something else to think of more  important even than Polly's eyes, for now the heartiest, the jolliest  of all the little group was down--Joel. How he fell sick, they scarcely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#11)"],[1,"employed. It is a small piece of  apparatus resembling an eyepiece, with a sliding eye lens, which can be  accurately focussed on a micrometer scale fixed within the instrument.  When placed over the microscope ocular the divisions of this scale  measure the actual size of the virtual image in millimetres.    In order to use this instrument for direct measurement, it is first  necessary to determine the magnifying power of each combination of  ocular, tube length and objective.    Place a stage micrometer divided into hundredths of a millimetre on the  microscope stage and focus accurately.    Rest the eikonometer on the eyepiece. Observation through the  eikonometer shows its micrometer scale superposed on the image of the  stage micrometer.    Rotate the eikonometer until the lines on the two scales are parallel,  and make the various adjustments to ensure that two lines on the  eikonometer scale coincide with two lines on the stage micrometer.    For the sake of illustration it may be assumed that five of the  divisions on the stage micrometer accurately fill one of the divisions  of the eikonometer scale; this indicates a magnifying power of 500 as  the constant for that particular optical combination, and a record  should be made of the fact.    The magnification constants of the various other optical combinations  should be similarly made and recorded.    To measure any object subsequently it should be first focussed carefully  in the ordinary way.    The eikonometer should then be applied to the eyepiece and the size of  the object read off on the eikonometer scale as millimetres, and the  actual size calculated by dividing the observed size by the  magnification constant for the particular optical combination employed  in the observation.    (c) By means of the filar micrometer.    [Illustration: FIG. 58.--Ramsden's Filar micrometer.]    [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Ramsden's micrometer field, a, fixed wire;  b, reference wire (fixed); c, travelling wire.]    The ~Filar~ or cobweb Micrometer (Ramsden's micrometer) eyepiece (Fig. 58)  consists of an ocular having a fine \"fixed\" wire stretching horizontally  across the field (Fig. 59), a vertical reference wire--fixed--adjusted  at right angles to the first; and a fine wire, parallel to the reference  wire, which can be moved across the field by the action of a micrometer  screw; the drum head is divided into one hundred parts, which  successively pass a fixed index as the head is turned. In the lower part  of the field is a comb with the intervals between its teeth  corresponding to one complete revolution of this screw-head.    As in the previous method, the value of each division of the micrometer  scale (i. e., the comb) must first be determined for each optical  combination. This is effected as follows:    1. Place the filar micrometer and the stage micrometer in their  respective positions.    2. Rotate the screw of the filar micrometer until the movable wire  coincides with the fixed one, and the index marks zero on the drum head.  (If when the drum head is at zero the two wires do not exactly coincide  they must be adjusted by loosening the drum screw and resetting the  drum.)    3. Focus the scale of each micrometer accurately, and make the lines on  them parallel.    4. Rotate the head of the micrometer screw until the movable line has  transversed one division of the stage micrometer. Note the number of  complete revolutions (by means of the recording comb) and the fractions  of a revolution (by means of scale on the head of the micrometer screw),  which are required to measure the 0.01 mm.    5. Make several such estimations and average the results.    6. Note the optical combination employed in this experiment and record  it carefully, together with the micrometer value in terms of  mu.    7. Repeat this process for each of the different optical combinations  and record the results.    To measure an object by this method, simply note the number of  revolutions and fractions of a revolution of the screw-head required to  traverse such object from edge to edge, and express the result as  _micra_ by reference to the recorded values for that particular optical  combination.    _Microscope Illuminant._--In tropical and subtropical regions diffuse  daylight is the best illuminant. In temperate climes however daylight of  the desirable quantity is not always available, and recourse must be  had to oil lamps, gas lamps--preferably those with incandescent  mantles--and electricity; and of these the last is undoubtedly the best.  A handy lamp holder which can be manufactured in the laboratory is shown  in Fig. 60. It consists of a base board weighted with lead to which is  attached the ordinary domestic lamp holder, and behind this is fastened  a curved sheet-iron reflector. An obscured metal filament lamp of about  16 candle power gives the most suitable light, and if monochromatic  light is needed, the blue grease pencil is streaked over the side of the  lamp nearest the microscope; the current is switched on and when the  glass bulb is warm, rubbing with a wad of cotton-wool will readily  distribute the blue greasy material in an even film over the ground  glass.    [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Electric microscope lamp.]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Its importance will be realised, however, when it is stated in the  words of the late Professor Abbe: \"The numerical aperture of a lens  determines all its essential qualities; the brightness of the image  increases with a given magnification and other things being equal, as  the square of the aperture; the resolving and defining powers are  directly related to it, the focal depth of differentiation of depths  varies inversely as the aperture, and so forth.\"    [2] Made by Mr. Otto Baumbach, 10, Lime Grove, Manchester.          V. MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF BACTERIA AND OTHER MICRO-FUNGI.      APPARATUS AND REAGENTS USED IN ORDINARY MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.    The following comprises the essential apparatus and reagents for routine  work with which each student should be provided.    1. India-rubber \"change-mat\" upon which cover-glasses may be rested  during the process of staining.    2. Squares of blotting paper about 10 cm., for drying cover-slips and  slides.    (The filter paper known as \"German lined\"--a highly absorbent, closely  woven paper, having an even surface and no loose \"fluff\" to adhere to  the specimens--is the most useful for this purpose.)    [Illustration: FIG. 61.--Disinfectant Jar.]    3. Glass jar filled with 2 per cent. lysol solution for the reception of  infected cover-glasses and infected pipettes, etc.    4. A square glazed earthenware box with a loose lining containing 2 per  cent. lysol solution for the reception of infected material and used  slides. The bottom of the lining is perforated so that when full the  lining and its contents can be lifted bodily out of the box, when the  disinfectant solution drains away and the slides, etc., can easily be  emptied out. The empty lining is then returned to the box with its  disinfectant solution (Fig. 61).    5. Bunsen burner provided with \"peep-flame\" by-pass.    6. Porcelain trough holding five or six hanging-drop slides (Fig. 62).    [Illustration: FIG. 62.--Hanging-drop slides: a, Double cell seen from  above; b, single cell seen from the side.]    The best form of hanging-drop slide is a modification of Boettcher's  glass ring slide, and is prepared by cementing a circular cell of tin,  13 to 15 mm. diameter, and 1 to 2 mm. in height, to the centre of a 3 by  1 slip by means of Canada balsam. It is often extremely convenient to  have two of these cells cemented close together on one slide (Fig. 62,  a).         Another form of hanging-drop slide is made in which a       circular or oval concavity or \"cell\" is ground out of the       centre of a 3 by 1 slip. These are more expensive, less       convenient to work with, and are more easily contaminated by       drops of material under examination, and should be carefully       avoided.    7. Three aluminium rods (Fig. 63), each about 25 cm. long and carrying a  piece of 0.015 gauge platino-iridium wire 7.5 cm. in length. The end of  one of the wires is bent round to form an oval loop, of about 1 mm. in  its short diameter, and is termed a loop or an oese; the terminal 3 or 4  mm. of another wire is flattened out by hammering it on a smooth iron  surface to form a \"spatula\"; the third is left untouched or is pointed  by the aid of a file. These instruments are used for inoculating culture  tubes and preparing specimens for microscopical examination.    [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Ends of platinum rods. a, loop; b, spatula;  c, needle.]    The method of mounting these wires may be described as follows:    Take a piece of aluminium wire 25 cm. long and about 0.25 cm. in  diameter, and drill a fine hole completely through the wire about a  centimetre from one end. Sink a straight narrow channel along one side  of the wire, in its long axis, from the hole to the nearest end, shallow  at first, but gradually becoming deeper.    On the opposite side of the wire make a short cut, 2 mm. in length,  leading from the hole in the same direction. [The use of a fine dental  drill and small circular saw, worked by a dental motor facilitates the  manufacture of these aluminium handled instruments.]    Now pass one end of the platinum wire through the hole, turn up about 2  mm. at right angles and press the short piece into the short cut. Turn  the long end of the wire sharply, also at right angles, and sink it into  the long channel so that it emerges from about the centre of the cut end  of the aluminium wire (Fig. 63). A few sharp taps with a watch maker's  hammer will now close in the sides of the two channels over the wire and  hold it securely.    [Illustration: FIG. 64.--Platinum rod in aluminium handle--method of  mounting.    The platinum wire may be fused into the end of a piece of glass "]]]
