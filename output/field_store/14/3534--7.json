On reaching the end they pulled their rifles down and crept back to  where they had started from.  Again they marched along, showing their  bayonets, as before.  The old Turks simply saw this constant stream of  bayonets.  They concluded that the Australians were massing for the  attack.  The Turks lined their trenches and opened up another furious  fusillade, supported by machine-guns and shrapnel.  Thousands of rounds  were expended before they realised that they had been fooled once more.    There was a lull next day, so Bill and his friends shaved off their  whiskers and had a bath in a cupful of water.  Claud cleaned his  eyeglass, and Paddy went in search of a glass of rum from some of the  sailors.  Sandy, then on light duty, opened up a business as a curio  agent.  He swapped Turkish rifles, bullet clips, and other things for  pieces of bread, a tin of jam, a tasty Maconochie, and some tea.  This  was a godsend to his famished pals in the trenches.  Bill also wrote a  letter home to Mrs. McGinnes, his old Sydney landlady and financier:      \"DEAR OLD SPORT,--Hope's your well.  I'm well, but the Turks ain't  well.  Reckon we've killed millions of 'em.  Ain't got the V.C. yet.  There's a shipload comin' next week for The Kangaroo Boys.  You can  'ave mine for a brooch.  Likin' the life fine here--except the bullets.  They generally kills a feller wot ain't careful.  There ain't no  undertakers out here.  When we wants a new kit we generally borrows the  clothes an' boots of a dead feller.  We live in little 'oles jist like  rabbits, an' the old Turks keep throwin' nasty things called bombs.  They ain't nice--one blew a feller's head off last night.  Pore chap,  an' he had such a nice pair of trousers--I've got 'em on now.  The  snipers are nasty fellers, 'demned annoyin',' as my ole friend Claud  says.  One keeps hittin' my loop-'ole, but I'm going to 'ave the dirty  ole rascal's blood to-night.  Now, ta ta, old girl.  Love to the  children.--Your ole friend,    \"BILL BUSTER.    \"_P.S._--Lend me a quid.  What a thirst I've got.  We can generally buy  rum from the sailors.  Make it two quid an' I'll send you a lot of  kurios.    \"_P.P.S._--I needs tobacco--couple of pounds 'll do.  An' throw in some  cigarettes.  Wot a life!    \"_P.P.P.S._--x x x x x x x x.  These are for you--don't tell yer hubby.  Bye-bye.\"      That night Claud spotted Bill crawling out of the trenches.    \"Where are you going, you silly ass?\"    \"Who's silly?\" said Bill, looking back at his friend in the trench.    Ping! went a bullet from the sniper.  It went right through his  trousers, but missed his leg.    \"It's that feller I'm after.\"    Before Claud could detain him he disappeared.  Dropping on to his  knees, he crawled for some distance, then lay flat.    Ping went the sniper's bullet again.  He saw the flash.  This  incidentally revealed the position of the Turk.  Fixing his bayonet,  Bill made a wide detour, At last he arrived in rear of his object.    Ping! went the rifle again.  So intent was the sniper on his job that  he did not hear the crawling man behind.  Like a snake, Bill wriggled  along.  He finished up ten yards behind his man.  This sniper had  killed and wounded thirty men in two days.  He did not deserve a quick  dispatch, and Bill had no intention of giving him that.  With a bound,  he jumped on him, and pinned him right through the shoulders with his  bayonet.    \"Allah!  Allah!\" shrieked the man, in the most dreadful pain.    \"Old Allah ain't no good to you now.  Get up!\"  And he was lifted up  with the bayonet.    When he rose from the ground Bill found he had a green bush tied all  round him.  His face and hands were afterwards found to be painted  green.  All this the Turks had acquired from their German masters.    \"Now, old cock, run!\" said Bill, pushing the man in front.    Screaming with pain the sniper was pushed at the double right up to the  Australian trench.    \"What's all that row there?\" roared the Colonel.    \"Jest been catchin' a sniper, Colonel,\" answered Bill, throwing his man  off the bayonet into the trench.  He dropped dead at the Colonel's feet.    \"A good death for him, too,\" said Sam, thinking of the fine fellows  this man had killed and wounded.  A sniper, let it be known, does not  play the clean game of war, and any punishment is justifiable.    Bill had given him his deserts.          CHAPTER VIII    \"HELL-FIRE POST\"      \"_Bullets here, bullets there,    Bullets, bullets everywhere._\"      Such is trench life.  Death at every corner, death at every moment of  the day.  Bullets plunk against the parapet with a monotonous  regularity; others crack in the air like a whip, while some whiz past  the ear like a great queen bee.  At odd intervals a dose of shrapnel  heightens the nerves, and now and again a high-explosive comes down  with a shuddering boom!    A trench isn't the place for a lady, it isn't the place for a  mild-mannered curate.  It's the place for blunt, hard and active men.  In fact, the nearer man is to the brute creation the better he is at  this game.  The highly strung, carefully fed, hot-house plant, such as  a mamma's darling, hasn't a look in.  He finds it a beastly bore, and  longs for the drawing-room cushions and afternoon tea.  Trench life  reveals the best and shows the worst.  A man's nature stands out like a  statue.  For trench life a man needs the stomach of a horse, the  strength of a lion, and the nerves of a navvy.  Any man can do a  bayonet charge; any man can shoot down the charging host; but it takes  a braver man to live in a trench month after month.  His nostrils are  filled with the stench of the fallen, for his parapet is frequently  built up with the dead.  His tea is made with water polluted with  germs, the bully beef stew is generally soaked in dust and sand.    And the flies!  They're worse than all, the pestilential breed!  Flies  kill more men than bullets.  Flies were surely invented by some ancient  Hun.    Trench life in France is a picnic compared with the Dardanelles.  In  France, one _can_ get soft bread, fresh coffee and yesterday's _Times_.  But, in the Dardanelles it is biscuits and bully, bully and  biscuits--without the news of Pollokshields and Mayfair.  Yet, despite  the severity of things, the Australasians were ever serene.  To them it  was a sporting game.  They had been used to boiling their own billy  cans; used to looking for firewood; used to making a shanty wherein to  lay their heads.  Where the Cockney might die from heat and thirst, the  Australasian can thrive like a Zulu or aborigine.  City bred troops  demand an organisation of things; Australasian troops organise things  for themselves.  And where our friends of The Kangaroo Marines were  certainly demanded all their cunning and courage.  It was called  \"Hell-Fire Post.\"  This was on the left of the Australian line, within  thirty yards of the Turks.  The post had developed from a thin line of  holes into a strong redoubt.  Many had died, more had been wounded in  defending this place, but it was worth it.  This was the key of the  whole line.  That was why The Kangaroo Marines were there.  When they  took it over, they found the parapets thin and bullets coming in all  round.    \"Hot shop, by Jove!\" said Claud, adjusting his monocle to look through  an aperture.    Crack! came a bullet, just missing his head.    \"Better take that window out of yer face,\" said Bill.    \"Why?\"    \"Them ole snipers thinks yer a general.\"    \"My dear fellow, you're a positive bore--now, lend me a hand.\"  And  Claud, despite the whizzing bullets, filled more sandbags and shoved  them up with a shovel.  Bill helped him to make a V-shaped aperture.  This work was continued all along the line.  But all the sandbags and  crack shots could not keep the rifle fire down.  To move a hand or head  above the level of the ground meant a wound.    \"This won't do,\" said the Colonel, as he made his morning visit on his  hands and knees.    \"It's like a penny shooting show, Colonel,\" said Bill.    \"Why?\"    \"Me an' the boys are doin' running man for them fellers over there.  They chip bits on yer head, an' bits on yer chest.  It ain't  comfortable.  It ain't war.\"    \"It's sudden daith,\" chipped in Sandy Brown.    \"All right, boys, I'll send up something to-day.  Cheer up, you'll soon  be at Manly amongst the girls,\" and off went Killem on his rounds.  That afternoon a dozen big iron plates came up.  These were square with  a hole in the centre.  This hole was covered by a little iron door,  which could be lifted at will.  Bill and his pals seized one and  commenced to fix it in position.  Under a hail of lead they worked  sweating, grousing and cursing all the time.  At last it was fixed and  ready for business.    \"This is my shot,\" said Bill, taking hold of his rifle.  Slowly he  opened the door, then peeped through.    \"I see one, boys!\"    \"Where?\" they whispered.    \"Behind some bags.  Gosh, ain't he ugly.  He's got a face like a black  puddin', and the eyes of a snake.  He ain't a bit of Turkish delight,  anyhow, I wouldn't like to lick his old face.  Wheesht, boys, he's  goin' to shoot.\"    \"At you?\"    \"No!  Some fathead down the line.  But I'll get the one-eyed Moslem  blighter,\" muttered Bill, taking careful aim.    \"Mind yis don't hit the ould fellow up in the moon,\" said Paddy just as  Bill let go.    \"Ye spud-faced Paddy.  Ye--ye--ye----\" blurted out Bill, throwing down  his gun in anger.    \"Missed, be Jasus--yis couldn't hit the town of Sydney at a hundred  yards.  Paddy Doolan's the man for that job.\"  He seized the rifle, but  just as he was going to open the little iron door there was a rattle of  bullets all over the plate.    \"Down, boys, down,\" he shouted.    \"It's a beastly Maxim,\" said Claud, looking up.  And a Maxim it was.  In ten minutes the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#11)"],[1,"to the proceedings. His fickle nerve came back again, for  he knew he would receive fair play. So he faced Hopalong once more and  regarded him with a cynical smile.    \"Yu seems to worry a whole lot about me. Is it because yu has a  tender feelin', or because it's none of yore blame business?\" He asked  aggressively.    Hopalong paled with sudden anger, but controlled himself.    \"It's because yu murdered Harris,\" he replied.    \"Shoo! An' how does yu figger it out?\" Asked Thirsty, jauntily.    \"He was huntin' yu hard an' yu thought yu'd stop it, so yu came in to  lay for him. When yu saw me an' him together yu saw di' chance to  wipe out another score. That's how I figger it out,\" replied Hopalong  quietly.    \"Yore a reg'lar 'tective, ain't yu?\" Thirsty asked ironically.    \"I've got common sense,\" responded Hopalong.    \"Yu has? Yu better tell th' rest that, too,\" replied Thirsty.    \"I know yu shot Harris, an' yu can't get out of it by makin' funny  remarks. Anyhow, yu won't be much loss, an' th' stage company'll feel  better, too.\"    \"Shoo! An' suppose I did shoot him, I done a good job, didn't I?\"    \"Yu did the worst job yu could do, yu highway robber,\" softly said  Hopalong, at the same time moving nearer. \"Harris knew yu stopped th'  stage last month, an' that's why yu've been dodgin' him.\"    \"Yore a liar!\" shouted Thirsty, reaching for his gun.    The movement was fatal, for before he could draw, the Colt in Hopalong's  holster leaped out and flashed from its owner's hip and Thirsty fell  sideways, face down in the dust of the street.    Hopalong started toward the fallen man, but as he did so a shot rang out  from behind the store and he pitched forward, stumbled and rolled behind  the bowlder. As he stumbled his left hand streaked to his hip, and when  he fell he had a gun in each hand.    As he disappeared from sight Goodeye and Bill Jones stepped from behind  the store and started to run away. Not able to resist the temptation to  look again, they stopped and turned and Bill laughed.    \"Easy as sin,\" he said.    \"Run, yu fool--Red an' Buck'll be here. Want to git plugged?\" shouted  Goodeye angrily.    They turned and started for a group of ponies twenty yards away, and as  they leaped into the saddles two shots were fired from the street. As  the reports died away Buck and Red turned the corner of the store, Colts  in hand, and, checking their rush as they saw the saddles emptied, they  turned toward the street and saw Hopalong, with blood oozing from an  abrasion on his cheek, sitting up cross-legged, with each hand holding a  gun, from which came thin wisps of smoke.    \"Th' son-of-a-gun!\" cried Buck, proud and delighted.    \"Th' son-of-a-gun!\" echoed Red, grinning.        CHAPTER VIII. Hopalong Keeps His Word    The waters of the Rio Grande slid placidly toward the Gulf, the hot sun  branding the sleepy waters with streaks of molten fire. To the north  arose from the gray sandy plain the Quitman Mountains, and beyond them  lay Bass Ca on. From the latter emerged a solitary figure astride a  broncho, and as he ascended the topmost rise he glanced below him at the  placid stream and beyond it into Mexico. As he sat quietly in his saddle  he smiled and laughed gently to himself. The trail he had just followed  had been replete with trouble which had suited the state of his mind  and he now felt humorous, having cleaned up a pressing debt with his  six-shooter. Surely there ought to be a mild sort of excitement in the  land he faced, something picturesque and out of the ordinary. This  was to be the finishing touch to his trip, and he had left his two  companions at Albuquerque in order that he might have to himself all  that he could find.    Not many miles to the south of him lay the town which had been the  rendezvous of Tamale Jose, whose weakness had been a liking for other  people's cattle. Well he remembered his first man hunt: the discovery  of the theft, the trail and pursuit and--the ending. He was scarcely  eighteen years of age when that event took place, and the wisdom he had  absorbed then had stood him in good stead many times since. He had even  now a touch of pride at the recollection how, when his older companions  had failed to get Tamale Jose, he with his undeveloped strategy had  gained that end. The fight would never be forgotten, as it was his  first, and no sight of wounds would ever affect him as did those of Red  Connors as he lay huddled up in the dark corner of that old adobe hut.    He came to himself and laughed again as he thought of Carmencita, the  first girl he had ever known--and the last. With a boy's impetuosity he  had wooed her in a manner far different from that of the peons who sang  beneath her window and talked to her mother. He had boldly scaled the  wall and did his courting in her house, trusting to luck and to his  own ability to avoid being seen. No hidden meaning lay in his words;  he spoke from his heart and with no concealment. And he remembered the  treachery that had forced him, fighting, to the camp of his outfit; and  when he had returned with his friends she had disappeared.    To this day he hated that mud-walled convent and those sisters who  so easily forgot how to talk. The fragrance of the old days wrapped  themselves around him, and although he had ceased to pine for his  black-eyed Carmencita-well, it would be nice if he chanced to see her  again. Spurring his mount into an easy canter he swept down to and  across the river, fording it where he had crossed it when pursuing  Tamale Jose.    The town lay indolent under the Mexican night, and the strumming of  guitars and the tinkle of spurs and tiny bells softly echoed from  several houses. The convent of St. Maria lay indistinct in its heavy  shadows and the little church farther up the dusty street showed dim  lights in its stained windows. Off to the north became audible the  rhythmic beat of a horse and soon a cowboy swept past the convent with a  mocking bow.    He clattered across the stone-paved plaza and threw his mount back  on its haunches as he stopped before a house. Glancing around and  determining to find out a few facts as soon as possible, he rode up  to the low door and pounded upon it with the butt of his Colt. After  waiting for possibly half a minute and receiving no response he hammered  a tune upon it with two Colts and had the satisfaction of seeing half a  score of heads protrude from the windows in the nearby houses.    \"If I could scare up another gun I might get th' whole blamed town up,\"  he grumbled whimsically, and fell on the door with another tune.    \"Who is it?\" came from within. The voice was distinctly feminine and  Hopalong winked to himself in congratulation.    \"Me,\" he replied, twirling his fingers from his nose at the curious,  forgetting that the darkness hid his actions from sight.    \"Yes, I know; but who is 'me'?\" Came from the house.    \"Ain't I a fool!\" he complained to himself, and raising his voice he  replied coaxingly, \"Open th' door a bit an' see. Are yu Carmencita?\"    \"O-o-o! but you must tell me who it is first.\"    \"Mr. Cassidy,\" he replied, flushing at the 'mister,' \"an' I wants to see  Carmencita.\"    \"Carmencita who?\" teasingly came from behind the door. Hopalong  scratched his head. \"Gee, yu've roped me--I suppose she has got another  handle. Oh, yu know--she used to live here about seven years back. She  had great big black eyes, pretty cheeks an' a mouth that 'ud stampede  anybody. Don't yu know now? She was about so high,\" holding out his  hands in the darkness.    The door opened a trifle on a chain and Hopalong peered eagerly forward.    \"Ah, it is you, the brave Americano! You must go away quick or you will  meet with harm. Manuel is awfully jealous and he will kill you! Go at  once, please!\"    Hopalong pulled at the half-hearted down upon his lip and laughed  softly. Then he slid the guns back in their holsters and felt for his  sombrero.    \"Manuel wants to see me first, Star Eyes.\"    \"No! no!\" she replied, stamping upon the floor vehemently. \"You must go  now--at once!\"    \"I'd shore look nice hittin' th' trail because Manuel Somebody wants  to get hurt, wouldn't I? Don't yu remember how I used to shinny up this  here wall an' skin th' cat gettin' through that hole up there what yu  said was a window? Ah, come on an' open th' door--I'd shore like to see  yu again!\" pleaded the irrepressible.    \"No! no! Go away. Oh, won't you please go away!\"    Hopalong sighed audibly and turned his horse. As he did so he heard the  door open and a sigh reached his ears. He wheeled like a flash and found  the door closed again on its chain. A laugh of delight came from behind  it.    \"Come out, please!--just for a minute,\" he begged, wishing that he was  brave enough to smash the door to splinters and grab her.    \"If I do, will you go away?\" Asked the girl. \"Oh, what will Manuel say  if he comes? And all those people, they'll tell him!\"    \"Hey, yu!\" shouted Hopalong, brandishing his Colts at the protruding  heads. \"Git scarce! I'll shore plug th' last one in!\" Then he laughed at  the sudden vanishing.    The door slowly opened and Carmencita, fat and drowsy, wobbled out  to him. Hopalong's feelings were interfering with his breathing as he  surveyed her. \"Oh, yu shore are mistaken, Mrs. Carmencita. I wants to  see yore daughter!\"    \"Ah, you have forgotten the little Carmencita who used to look for you.  Like all the men, you have forgotten,\" she cooed reproachfully. Then her  fear predominated again and she cried, \"Oh, if my husband should see me  now!\"    Hopalong mastered his astonishment and bowed. He had a desire to ride  madly into the Rio Grande and collect his senses.    \"Yu are right--this is too dangerous--I'll amble on some,\" he replied  hastily. Under his breath he prayed that the outfit would never learn  of this. He turned his horse and rode slowly up the street as the door  closed.    Rounding the corner"]]]
