Chain 1, a double in each double, narrowing at middle of vamp and on  the sides.    20. Turn and work across top of vamp with a double in each stitch.    21. For the upper part of shoe, slip to 1st double at side of vamp, 2d  row back, chain 11, turn, miss 1, 10 doubles in 10 stitches, catch in  1st double of side of shoe, a single in next double on side of shoe,  turn; a double in each of 9 doubles, 2 in last, turn; chain 1, 2 doubles  in 1st double, 1 in each following double, join to next double of side,  a single in next, turn; a double in each double of last row, with 2 at  end, turn; chain 1, a double in each of 2 doubles, chain 5, miss 5, a  double in each following double, join to next double of side, a single  in next, turn; double in each double, with 5 in 5 stitches of chain,  turn; chain 1, a double in each double; join, slip in next double of  side, turn; work 5 more rows, widening 1 stitch at end of every other  row; then chain 4, turn; miss 1, a double in each of 3 stitches and  double in each double, join, slip in next double, turn; work back with  double in each double, chain 1, turn, 2 doubles in 2 doubles, chain 5,  miss 5, double in double, join, slip in next double, turn, work back  with double in double, chain 1, turn, and work double in double around  to within 14 stitches of top of vamp on other side, turn; chain 1,  double in double to edge of flap, turn; chain 1 and make a double in  double around to the other side. Continue thus until you have worked 6  rows around top of shoe, then make a buttonhole as before, and finish  with 4 rows. The shoe may be made higher, if desired, and more  buttonholes added.    For the buttons. Chain 3, join; 8 doubles in ring; 2 doubles in each  double; a double in each double; a double in every other double; slip in  a pearl or porcelain button of requisite size, draw together, and sew to  the shoe, matching the position of the buttonholes.          Ribbed House-Slippers      [Illustration: Ribbed House-slipper]    Use 2-fold Shetland zephyr, or any similar yarn of moderate twist.  Commencing at the toe, make a chain of 11 stitches, turn.    1. A double in 2d stitch of chain and 1 in each of 8 stitches, 3 doubles  in end chain, 1 double in each of 9 stitches down other side of chain,  in same stitches where the 1st 9 doubles were worked, chain 1, turn.    2. Ten doubles in 10 doubles, taking up back vein of stitch to form the  rib, 3 doubles in next, or center stitch, 10 doubles in 10 doubles,  chain 1, turn.    3, 4, 5. Same as 2d row, making 1 extra double each side of center, each  row.    6. A double in each double, without widening, chain 1, turn.    7. A double in each double, with 3 in center stitch.    Repeat 6th and 7th rows until you have 25 ribs, or the vamp is as deep  as desired. If preferred, the widening may be made every row, putting 2  doubles in one and then the other, alternately, of the widening doubles.    For the side of foot make 24 doubles in 24 doubles, chain 1, turn, a  double in double, chain 1, turn, and continue until you have 44 ribs, or  the strip is of sufficient length to extend easily around the sole; join  neatly to 24 doubles on opposite side of vamp.    Around top of slipper work a beading in which to run the elastic, thus:  Fasten in, between 2 ribs, chain 10, * miss 5 ribs, a triple treble  (over 3 times) between next 2, chain 1, a triple treble between next 2,  chain 5, repeat from * around, ending with 1 triple treble, chain 1,  join to 5th of 10 chain.    For ruching: Have 3 strands of yarn, insert hook in work, over 4 times,  pull through, and repeat in each stitch, pulling the loops out about  three-fourths inch, and always taking yarn next to you to next stitch;  make this for bottom of beading, as well, and the latter will be  entirely covered. Run an elastic band or tape in the beading, between  the 2 triple trebles, and make a bow of ribbon for instep of the same  shade as the yarn.          Baby's Bootees      [Illustration: No. 1. Baby's Bootees]    A pair of dainty bootees makes a nice gift for baby, and is appreciated  scarcely less by baby's mamma. Two very pretty styles are given, one in  pink and white, the accepted colors for a girlie, the other in blue and  white--blue being the color usually chosen for a little son's  belongings.[Transcriber's Note: The original had blue and pink reversed  in the above paragraph.]    Commencing with white Saxony, make a chain of 11 stitches, turn.    NO. 1. 1.--Miss 1 stitch, a double in each of 10 stitches, turn.    2. Chain 1, a double in each of 10 doubles, taking up the back loop of  stitch to form a rib, turn.    Repeat 2d row until you have 8 ribs; at the end of the last row chain  11, turn, miss 1, a double in each of 10 stitches of chain and in 10  doubles, chain 1, turn, and continue, making 4 of the long ribs, then,  working only on the 10 doubles, make 8 more short ribs, and join at the  back of the leg to the foundation chain, taking into each stitch.    For the upper part of leg:    1. Chain 3, and make trebles all around, 38 in all, joining to top of 3  chain.    2. Draw out the stitch on needle, pull up a loop through 1st and 3d  stitches of preceding row, take up the yarn, and draw through the 3  loops on the needle at once, chain 1 to close the cluster, * draw up a  loop in same place with last and another in 3d stitch, work off as  before and repeat around.    3. Draw out the stitch on needle, take a loop in the space before  pineapple-stitch of last row and another in the space after, work off as  before, take a loop in same space as before, another in next space, work  off, and repeat.    4. Like 3d row, with blue.    5, 6. Like 3d row, with white.    7. With blue, a double in each stitch.    8. With white, chain 3, a treble in each double, join.    9. With blue, make 1 double in 1st stitch, chain 3, 1 double in same  stitch, miss 1; repeat. Fasten off neatly.    For the foot:    1. With blue make a double in each stitch all around bottom of leg and  instep.    2. A double in each double, taking up both veins of stitch to avoid a  rib.    3, 4. Same as 2d row, with white.    5, 6. Same as 2d row, with blue.    7, 8, 9, 10. Same as 2d row, with white, joining the last row with  single crochet on the wrong side. Finish with cord and tassels or with  ribbon, run in and out the 1st row of trebles on upper part of leg.           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: No. 2. Baby's Bootees]    NO. 2. Using the white yarn make a chain of 37 stitches, join.    1. Chain 3, a treble in each stitch, join.    2, 3. With pink, make a double in each stitch, join. Repeat 1st, 2d and  3d rows 3 times, which will give you 4 ribs each of pink and white.    13. Chain 3, with white, miss 1st stitch of last row, make a treble in  next, then a treble back in 1st stitch, forming a crossed treble; repeat  around, join.    14. With pink, a double in a stitch, chain 3; repeat. Fasten off  securely.    For the foot:    1. With white, fasten in the 17th treble from back of leg, draw up a  loop through each of 6 stitches, keeping all on needle; take up yarn and  draw through 1st stitch, * again draw through 2, and repeat until all  are worked off; now insert hook under the little upright bar formed by  working off the last row, draw up a loop and repeat until you have again  the number of loops on needle; continue until you have 9 rows of  afghan-stitch.    Again using white, fasten at back of leg and make a double in each  stitch of leg and around the instep; make 4 more rows of doubles, 1 in  each stitch of preceding row, taking up both loops to avoid a rib, then  5 rows of pink in the same way, joining the last row as before directed.  Finish with cord and tassels or ribbon, run in the 4th row of trebles  around top of bootee.          A Sweater and Cap for Dolly      [Illustration: Sweater and Cap for Dolly]    One skein of white and blue Saxony will be sufficient for two sets; use  a crochet-hook that will carry the wool easily. Commence the sweater  with a chain of 60 stitches.    1. A double in each stitch of chain, turn.    2. A treble and a double in back of double of last row (chain 3 for 1st  treble of the row), miss 1 double; repeat to end of row, turn.    3. A treble and a double taken between treble and double of last row;  repeat.    4. A double in back of each stitch of last row (chain 1 for 1st double).    5. Same as 4th row. This completes the portion over the shoulder.    On one half the length repeat the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th and again the 2d row  which completes one front. Work in the same way on the other half of  length, which brings you to the center of the back and makes half of the  sweater. Make the other half to correspond, and join neatly down center  of back. Fold and join under the arms, making the armscye of desired  size.    For the sleeve: Make a chain of 15 stitches, and repeat from 1st to 5th  row; then repeat from 2d to 5th row twice, and join last row to 1st;  also crochet sleeve in the armscye.    Entirely around the sweater make 4 rows of double crochet with blue  yarn, working in both veins of stitch to avoid a rib, and putting 3  stitches in 1 at corners to turn smoothly. After working 2 rows of left  front make the buttonholes, separated by 8 doubles, by chain 3, miss 3;  then in next row make a double also in each stitch of chain.    Finish bottom of sleeves in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26117"],[0,"Sketches of the Fair Sex, in All Parts of the World. (#11)"],[1,"a momentary dignity and grace to the merest trifles. Studious  only to mimic such peculiarities as are most admired in others, she  affects a loquacity peculiarly flippant and teazing because scandal,  routs, finery, fans, china, lovers, lap-dogs, or squirrels, are her  constant themes. Her amusements, like those of a magpie, are only  hopping over the same spots, prying into the same corners, and devouring  the same species of prey. The simple and beautiful delineations of  nature, in her countenance, gestures and whole deportment, are  habitually arranged, distorted, or concealed, by the affected adoption  of whatever grimace or deformity is latest or most in vogue.    She accustoms her face to a simper, which every separate feature in it  belies. She spoils, perhaps, a blooming complexion with a profusion of  artificial coloring, she distorts the most exquisite shape by loads or  volumes of useless drapery. She has her head, her arms, her feet, and  her gait, equally touched by art and affectation, into what is called  the _taste_, the _ton_, or the _fashion_.    She little considers to what a torrent of ridicule and sarcasm this mode  of conduct exposes her; or how exceedingly cold and hollow that ceremony  must be, which is not the language of a warm heart. She does not reflect  how insipid those smiles are, which indicate no internal pleasantry; nor  how awkward those graces, which spring not from habits of good-nature  and benevolence. Thus, pertness succeeds to delicacy, assurance to  modesty, and all the vagaries of a listless to the sensibilities of an  ingenuous mind.    With her, punctilio is politeness; dissipation, life; and levity,  spirit. The miserable and contemptible drudge of every tawdry innovation  in dress or ceremony, she incessantly mistakes extravagance for taste,  and finery for elegance.    Her favorite examples are not those persons of acknowledged sincerity,  who speak as they feel, and act as they think; but such only as are  formed to dazzle her fancy, amuse her senses, or humor her whims. Her  only study is how to glitter or shine, how to captivate and gratify the  gaze of the multitude, or how to swell her own pomp and importance. To  this interesting object all her assiduities and time are religiously  devoted.    How often is debility of mind, and even badness of heart concealed under  a splendid exterior! The fairest of the species, and of the sex, often  want sincerity; and without sincerity every other qualification is  rather a blemish, than a virtue, or excellence. Sincerity operates on  the moral, somewhat like the sun on the natural world; and produces  nearly the same effects on the dispositions of the human heart, which he  does on inanimate objects. Wherever sincerity prevails and is felt, all  the smiling and benevolent virtues flourish most, disclose their  sweetest lustre, and diffuse their richest fragrance.    Heaven has not a finer or more perfect emblem on earth than a woman of  genuine simplicity. She affects no graces which are not inspired by  sincerity. Her opinions result not from passion and fancy, but from  reason and experience. Candor and humility give expansion to her heart.  She struggles for no kind of chimerical credit, disclaims the appearance  of every affectation, and is in all things just what she seems, and  others would be thought. Nature, not art, is the great standard of her  manners; and her exterior wears no varnish, or embellishment, which is  not the genuine signature of an open, undesigning, and benevolent mind.  It is not in her power, because not in her nature, to hide, with a  fawning air, and a mellow voice, her aversion or contempt, where her  delicacy is hurt, here temper ruffled, or her feelings insulted.    In short, whatever appears most amiable, lovely, or interesting in  nature, art, manners, or life, originates in simplicity. What is  correctness in taste, purity in morals, truth in science, grace in  beauty, but simplicity? It is the garb of innocence. It adorned the  first ages, and still adorns the infant state of humanity. Without  simplicity, woman is a vixen, a coquette, a hypocrite; society a  masquerade, and pleasure a phantom.    The following story, I believe, is pretty generally known. A lady, whose  husband had long been afflicted with an acute but lingering disease,  suddenly feigned such an uncommon _tenderness_ for him, as to resolve on  dying in his stead. She had even the address to persuade him not to  outlive this extraordinary instance of her conjugal fidelity and  attachment. It was instantaneously agreed they should mutually swallow  such a quantity of arsenic, as would speedily effect their dreadful  purpose. She composed the fatal draught before his face and even set him  the desperate example of drinking first. By this device, which had all  the appearance of the greatest affection and candor, the dregs only were  reserved for him, and soon put a period to his life.    It then appeared that the dose was so tempered, as, from the weight of  the principal ingredient, to be deadly only at the bottom, which she had  artfully appropriated for his share. Even after all this finesse, she  seized, we are told, his inheritance, and insulted his memory by a  second marriage.      THE MILD MAGNANIMITY OF WOMEN.    A late eminent anatomist, in a professional discourse on the female  frame, is said to have declared, that it almost appeared an act of  cruelty in nature to produce such a being as woman. This remark may,  indeed, be the natural exclamation of refined sensibility, in  contemplating the various maladies to which a creature of such delicate  organs is inevitably exposed; but, if we take a more enlarged survey of  human existence, we shall be far from discovering any just reason to  arraign the benevolence of its provident and gracious Author. If the  delicacy of woman must render her familiar with pain and sickness, let  us remember that her charms, her pleasures, and her happiness, arise  also from the same attractive quality. She is a being, to use the  forcible and elegant expression of a poet,      \"Fine by defect, and admirably weak.\"    There is, perhaps, no charm by which she more effectually secures the  tender admiration and the lasting love, of the more hardy sex, than her  superior endurance, her mild and _graceful_ submission to the common  evils of life.    Nor is this the sole advantage she derives from her gentle fortitude. It  is the prerogative of this lovely virtue, to lighten the pressure of all  those incorrigible evils which it cheerfully endures. The frame of man  may be compared to the sturdy _oak_, which is often shattered by  resisting the tempest. Woman is the pliant _osier_, which, in bending to  the storm, eludes its violence.    The accurate observers of human nature will readily allow, that patience  is most eminently the characteristic of woman. To what a sublime and  astonishing height this virtue has been carried by beings of the most  delicate texture, we have striking examples in the many female martyrs  who were exposed, in the first ages of christianity, to the most  barbarous and lingering torture.    Nor was it only from christian zeal that woman derived the power of  defying the utmost rigors of persecution with invincible fortitude.  Saint Ambrose, in his elaborate and pious treatise on this subject,  records the resolution of a fair disciple of Pythagoras, who, being  severely urged by a tyrant to reveal the secrets of her sex, to convince  him that no torments should reduce her to so unworthy a breach of her  vow, bit her own _tongue_ asunder, and darted it in the face of her  oppressor.    In consequence of those happy changes which have taken place in the  world, from the progress of purified religion, the inexpressible spirit  of the tender sex is no longer exposed to such inhuman trials. But if  the earth is happily delivered from the demons of torture and  superstition; if beauty and innocence are no more in danger of being  dragged to perish at the stake--perhaps there are situations, in female  life, that require as much patience and magnanimity, as were formerly  exerted in the fiery torments of the virgin martyr. It is more difficult  to support an accumulation of _minute_ infelicities, than any single  calamity of the most terrific magnitude.      FEMALE DELICACY.    Where the human race has little other culture than what it receives from  nature, the two sexes live together, unconscious of almost any restraint  on their words or on their actions. The Greeks, in the heroic ages, as  appears from the whole history of their conduct, were totally  unacquainted with delicacy. The Romans in the infancy of their empire,  were the same. Tacitus informs us that the ancient Germans had not  separate beds for the two sexes, but that they lay promiscuously on  reeds or on heath, spread along the walls of their houses. This custom  still prevails in Lapland, among the peasants of Norway, Poland, and  Russia; and it is not altogether obliterated in some parts of the  highlands of Scotland and Wales.    In Otaheite, to appear naked or in clothes, are circumstances equally  indifferent to both sexes; nor does any word in their language, nor any  action to which they are prompted by nature, seem more indelicate or  reprehensible than another. Such are the effects of a total want of  culture.    Effects not very dissimilar, are, in France and Italy, produced from a  redundance of it. Though those are the polite countries in Europe, women  there set themselves above shame, and despise delicacy. It is laughed  out of existence, as a silly and unfashionable weakness.    But in China, one of the politest countries in Asia, and perhaps not  even, in this respect, behind France, or Italy, the case is quite  otherwise. No human being can be more delicate than a Chinese woman in  her dress, in her behavior, and in her conversation; and should she ever  happen"]]]
