[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#11)"],[1,"Monte Amiata in  Tuscany, where it was preserved for several centuries[101]. The thorough  investigation to which this manuscript has lately been subjected shews  that it was written in England, at Wearmouth or Jarrow, but possibly by an  Italian scribe, before A.D. 716, in which year it was taken to Rome, as a  present to the Pope. The first quaternion, however, on one of the leaves  of which the above representation occurs, is probably older; and it may  have belonged to a certain _Codex grandior_ mentioned by Cassiodorus, and  possibly written under his direction[102].    The picture (fig. 15), which appears as the frontispiece to this work,  shews Ezra writing the law. On the margin of the vellum, in a hand which  is considered to be later than that of the MS., are the words:        CODICIBUS SACRIS HOSTILI CLADE PERVSTIS      ESDRA DEO FERVENS HOC REPARAVIT OPUS.    Behind him is a press (_armarium_) with open doors. The lower portion,  below these doors, is filled in with panels which are either inlaid or  painted, so that the frame on which it is supported is not visible, as in  the Ravenna example. The bottom of the press proper is used as a shelf, on  which lie a volume and two objects, one of which probably represents a  case for pens, while the other is certainly an inkhorn. Above this are  four shelves, on each of which lie two volumes. These volumes have their  titles written on their backs, but they are difficult to make out, and my  artist has not cared to risk mistakes by attempting to reproduce them. The  words, beginning at the left hand corner of the top-shelf, are:      OCT.[103] LIB.     REG.    HIST. LIB.       PSALM. LIB.    SALOMON.         PROPH.    EVANG. IIII.     EPIST. XXI.    ACT. APOSTOL.    The frame-work of the press above the doors is ornamented in the same  style as the panels below, and the whole is surmounted by a low pyramid,  on the side of which facing the spectator is a cross, beneath which are  two peacocks drinking from a water-trough.    I regret that I could not place this remarkable drawing before my readers  in the rich colouring of the original. The press is of a reddish brown:  the books are bound in crimson. Ezra is clad in green, with a crimson  robe. The background is gold. The border is blue, between an inner and  outer band of silver. The outermost band of all is vermilion.    I formerly thought that this book-press might represent those in use in  England at the beginning of the eighth century; but, if the above  attribution to Cassiodorus be accurate, it must be accounted another  Italian example. It bears a general similarity to the Ravenna book-press,  as might be expected, when it is remembered that Cassiodorus held office  under Theodoric and his successors, and resided at Ravenna till he was  nearly seventy years old.    The foundation of Christianity did not alter what I may call the Roman  conception of a library in any essential particular. The philosophers and  authors of Greece and Rome may have occasionally found themselves in  company with, or even supplanted by, the doctors of the Church; but in  other respects, for the first seven centuries, at least, of our era, the  learned furnished their libraries according to the old fashion, though  with an ever increasing luxury of material. Boethius, whose _Consolation  of Philosophy_ was written A.D. 525, makes Philosophy speak of the \"walls  of a library adorned with ivory and glass[104]\"; and Isidore, Bishop of  Seville A.D. 600-636, records that \"the best architects object to gilded  ceilings in libraries, and to any other marble than _cipollino_ for the  floor, because the glitter of gold is hurtful to the eyes, while the green  of _cipollino_ is restful to them[105].\"    A few examples of such libraries may be cited; but, before doing so, I  must mention the Record-Office (_Archivum_), erected by Pope Damasus  (366-384). It was connected with the Basilica of S. Lawrence, which  Damasus built in the Campus Martius, near the theatre of Pompey. On the  front of the Basilica, over the main entrance, was an inscription, which  ended with the three following lines:        ARCHIVIS FATEOR VOLUI NOVA CONDERE TECTA ADDERE PRAETEREA      DEXTRA LAEVAQUE COLUMNAS QUAE DAMASI TENEANT PROPRIUM PER      SAECULA NOMEN.        I confess that I have wished to build a new abode for      Archives; and to add columns on the right and left to      preserve the name of Damasus for ever.    These enigmatical verses contain all that we know, or are ever likely to  know, respecting this building, which is called _chartarium ecclesiae  Romanae_ by S. Jerome[106], and unquestionably held the official documents  of the Latin Church until they were removed to the Lateran in the seventh  century. The whole building, or group of buildings, was destroyed in 1486  by Cardinal Raphael Riario, the dissolute nephew of Sixtus IV., to make  room for his new palace, now called Palazzo della Cancelleria, and the  church was rebuilt on a new site. The connexion with Pope Damasus is  maintained by the name, S. Lorenzo in Damaso. No plan of the old  buildings, or contemporary record of their arrangement, appears to exist.  My only reason for drawing attention to a structure which has no real  connexion with my subject is that the illustrious De Rossi considers that  in the second line of the above quotation the word column signifies  colonnades; and that Damasus took as his model one of the great pagan  libraries of Rome which, in its turn, had been derived from the typical  library at Pergamon[107]. According to this view he began by building, in  the centre of the area selected, a basilica, or hall of basilican type,  dedicated to S. Lawrence; and then added, on the north and south sides, a  colonnade or loggia from which the rooms occupied by the records would be  readily accessible. This opinion is also held by Signor Lanciani, who  follows De Rossi without hesitation. I am unwilling to accept a theory  which seems to me to have no facts to support it; and find it safer to  believe that the line in question refers either to the aisles of the  basilica, or to such a portico in front of it as may be seen at San  Clemente and other early churches.    A letter to Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons in A.D. 441, from a correspondent  named Rusticus, gives a charming picture of a library which he had visited  in his young days, say about A.D. 400:        I am reminded of what I read years ago, hastily, as a      boy does, in the library of a man who was learned in      secular literature. There were there portraits of      Orators and also of Poets worked in mosaic, or in wax of      different colours, or in plaster, and under each the      master of the house had placed inscriptions noting their      characteristics; but, when he came to a poet of      acknowledged merit, as for instance, Virgil, he began as      follows:      Virgilium vatem melius sua carmina laudant;    In freta dum fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae    Lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera pascet,    Semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt.      Virgil's own lines most fitly Virgil praise:    As long as rivers run into the deep,    As long as shadows o'er the hillside sweep,    As long as stars in heaven's fair pastures graze,    So long shall live your honour, name, and praise.[108]      Agapetus, who was chosen Pope in 535, and lived for barely a year, had  intended, in conjunction with Cassiodorus, to found a college for teachers  of Christian doctrine. He selected for this purpose a house on the Caelian  Hill, afterwards occupied by S. Gregory, and by him turned into a  monastery. Agapetus had made some progress with the scheme, so far as the  library attached to the house was concerned, for the author of the  Einsiedlen MS., who visited Rome in the ninth century, saw the following  inscription \"in the library of S. Gregory\"--i.e. in the library attached  to the Church of San Gregorio Magno.      SANCTORVM VENERANDA COHORS SEDET ORDINE LONGO      DIVINAE LEGIS MYSTICA DICTA DOCENS    HOS INTER RESIDENS AGAPETVS IVRE SACERDOS      CODICIBVS PVLCHRVM CONDIDIT ARTE LOCVM    GRATIA PAR CVNCTIS SANCTVS LABOR OMNIBVS VNVS      DISSONA VERBA QVIDEM SED TAMEN VNA FIDES      Here sits in long array a reverend troop    Teaching the mystic truths of law divine:    'Mid these by right takes Agapetus place    Who built to guard his books this fair abode.    All toil alike, all equal grace enjoy--    Their words are different, but their faith the same.    These lines undoubtedly imply that there was on the walls a long series of  portraits of the Fathers of the Church, including that of Agapetus  himself, who had won his right to a place among them by building a  sumptuous home for their works[109].    The design of Agapetus, interrupted by death, was carried forward by his  friend Cassiodorus, at a place in South Italy called Vivarium, near his  own native town Squillace. Shortly after his final retirement from court,  A.D. 538, Cassiodorus established there a brotherhood, which, for a time at  least, must have been a formidable rival to that of S. Benedict. A library  held a prominent place in his conception of what was needed for their  common life. He says little about its size or composition, but much  rhetoric is expended on the contrivances by which its usefulness and  attractiveness were to be increased. A staff of bookbinders was to clothe  the manuscripts in decorous attire; self-supplying lamps were to light  nocturnal workers; sundials by day, and water-clocks by night, enabled  them to regulate their hours. Here also was a _scriptorium_, and it  appears probable that between the exertions of Cassiodorus and his friend  Eugippius, South Italy was well supplied with manuscripts[110].    These attempts to snatch from oblivion libraries which, though probably  according to our ideas insignificant, were centres of culture in the  darkest of dark ages, will be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#11)"],[1,"around and  on the end of the stem. Flowers sessile, verticillate, on the ends  of several very long peduncles which rise from the midst of the  petioles. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals, clawed, rounded at the  end and slightly notched, forming a tube. Stamens 10, free. A small  gland on the outer surface of the base of each short stamen. Styles  5. Seed vessels ovate, 5-angled, containing many seeds.    Habitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.        _Averrhoa Bilimbi_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Kamias_, _Kalamias_, Tag.; _Kilingiwa_, Vis.; _Pias_,  Iloc.    Uses.--The small fruit of the camia springing from the branches  and trunks of the trees is widely known in the Philippines, where  they eat it green, pickled, and in salad; and when ripe fresh and  preserved. Its qualities and therapeutic applications are the same  as those of the following species.    Botanical Description.--A tree 4-5 meters high with  odd-pinnate leaves. Leaflets 12 pairs, ovate, linear, acute,  soft and downy. Flowers small, pinkish or purplish, on trunk and  branches. Stamens 10, five alternately longer. Pistils divergent. Fruit  oblong, obtuse at the end, with five broad ribs.    Habitat.--Very common throughout the islands.        _Averrhoa Carambola_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Bilimbin_, _Balimbin_, Tag.    Uses.--The common name of this tree, whose fruit is so common, causes  it to be confused with the name which Linnæus gives to the former  species. Balimbin is a fruit of an acid taste, agreeable when ripe,  serving the same uses for food as the camia. Its acidity is due to  the presence of oxalic acid, which makes the green fruit useful for  removing ink and rust stains from clothes. The juice of the fruit is  refreshing and is given internally mixed with water and sugar as a  refreshing drink in fevers and as an antiscorbutic. For the latter  the ripe fruit is eaten uncooked.    In Mauritius the juice is used to treat dysentery and hepatitis. Padre  Blanco says that the natives use a decoction of camias and unthreshed  rice in diarrhoea and bilious colic. In connection with the subject  of camias and balimbins we should mention the fruit treatment of the  bilious diarrhoea of the tropics, spoken of by the French physicians  of Cochin China. Dr. Van der Burg of the Dutch Indies also strongly  recommends the treatment of diarrhoea by fruits; in temperate regions  using fruits like peaches, pears, etc., and in the tropics, lychies,  mangosteens, etc. In regard to the mangosteens we must not forget that,  while the bark is given because of the amount of tannin it contains,  the composition of the pulp is very different. The fruit acids seem  to exercise great influence in the cure of this obstinate disease  and I do not hesitate to recommend for this purpose the camia and  the ripe balimbin.    Botanical Description.--A tree much like the former. Leaves  odd-pinnate. Leaflets, 3-4 pairs, obliquely ovate, acute, the terminal  leaflet nearly lanceolate. Flowers on the trunk, branches and in the  axils of the leaves. Fruit oblong, with 5 very prominent acute-angled  ribs.    Habitat.--It grows, like the former plant, in all parts of the islands.          RUTACEÆ.    Rue Family.        _Ruta graveolens, L._ (_L. angustifolia_, Pers.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Rudu_, Sp.; _Rue_, Eng.    Uses.--The rue of the European, American and Indian pharmacopoeias  is emmenagogue, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, excitant, diaphoretic,  antiseptic and abortive. It contains an essential oil, and rutinic  acid (C_25_H_28_O_15_, Borntrager), starch, gum, etc. The essential  oil is greenish-yellow, thick, acrid and bitter; specific gravity  0.911. It boils at 228°, is slightly soluble in water, and soluble  in absolute alcohol. It is promptly oxidized by nitric acid, and is  converted into pelargonic acid and other fatty acids.    Rutin (or rutinic acid), according to Weiss, is a glucoside which  exists in the form of fine needles, bright yellow in color. It is  slightly soluble in cold water and more so in boiling water. It melts  at 190°, and solidifies at freezing point, forming a resinous mass. Its  physiological properties are as yet unknown. The part of the plant  employed is the leaves, which owe their property, apparently, to the  essential oil they contain, from which they also derive their strong  and disagreeable odor and their bitter, acrid and nauseous taste.    It is used principally as a uterine stimulant or emmenagogue, for which  purpose it is given in doses of 0.10-0.15 centigrams of the freshly  powdered leaf and 0.05-0.10 centigrams of the fresh leaves infused in a  liter of water. The dry powder of the leaf should not be used because  the essential oil volatilizes and a large proportion of it is lost,  which is the most active principle of the drug. It is an agent which  should be prescribed with the greatest prudence for large doses are  poisonous even to the point of causing death. The symptoms following  such doses are colic, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and tenesmus.    It is also used as an antihemorrhagic after childbirth, but its action  is slow, not being felt for several hours after the administration of  the drug; for this reason it cannot take the place of ergot, though  it seems to be superior to the latter in passive hemorrhages. The  essential oil is given internally in doses of 2-6 drops on a piece  of sugar. It is sometimes used as an antispasmodic in hysteria,  epilepsy and chorea.    The Chinese make extensive use of this drug and it is one of their  principal abortives. In Hindostan the dried leaves are burnt and the  smoke inhaled as a cure for catarrh in children. They are careful  not to administer it to pregnant women.    Botanical Description.--A plant, 1 meter high, with leaves alternate,  compound, the inferior ones 2-3-cleft; leaflets narrow, oblong,  slightly fleshy. Flowers greenish-yellow, hermaphrodite, arranged in  corymbose terminal cymes. Corolla, 4-5 free, concave petals. Calyx  deeply divided, persistent. Stamens 8-10, free, in two whorls, inserted  beneath a thick disc. Ovaries 5, unilocular, many-ovuled. Styles 5,  first free, then united, forming a column terminating in a small  stigma. Follicles 5, united at the base, 1 centimeter long, free  superiorly, hard, rounded, rugose, opening on top. Seeds ovoid,  angular, blackish, albuminous.    Habitat.--Common everywhere in the Philippines.        _Xanthoxylum oxyphyllum_, Edgew. (_X. violaceum_, Wall.; _Fagara  piperita_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kayutana_, Tag.; _Salay_, _Saladay_, Vis.    Uses.--The trunk bark is stimulant and is used as a sudorific in the  treatment of fevers. The fresh bark is quite irritating, for which  reason it is best to use bark taken from the more mature parts of  the trunk, powdered and desiccated. The dose is 1/2-2 grams 2-3  times a day. Its stimulating properties render it useful in colic  and in India it is used as a stomachic and digestive. Is seems also  to possess diuretic properties.    Botanical Description.--A tree 30-35° high, with trunk thickly set  with large spines. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets ovate, acute, obtusely  serrate, small transparent vesicles on the surface, spines on the  midrib and common petiole. Calyx very small, monophyllous. Corolla  twice as large as the calyx, 4 petals. Stamens 4, inserted on the  receptacle, the same length as the petals. Ovary superior, 4-angled. No  style. Stigmas 2.    Habitat.--Batangas, Morong, Manila.        _Murraya exotica_, L. (_M. paniculata_, Jack.; _Connarus foetens_,  and _C. santaloides_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kamuning_, Tag.    Uses.--The leaves are stimulant and astringent, and are used  in infusion (15 grams, to water one liter) to treat diarrhea and  dysentery. The root and trunk barks are used for the same treatment  and they as well as the leaves owe their properties to an essential  oil and a bitter principle present in all parts of the plant. Vry has  demonstrated the presence of a glucoside which he has named _murrayin_  (C_18_H_22_O_10_); it crystallizes in small, white needles, is slightly  bitter, soluble in hot water and alcohol, insoluble in ether, slightly  soluble in cold water. It melts at 170°, and dissolves in alkaline  solutions coloring them green. Boiled in dilute acids it splits into  _murrayetin_ and glucose. _Murrayetin_ (C_12_H_12_O_10_) crystallizes  in white needles, inodorous, tasteless, slightly soluble in cold water  and in ether, soluble in hot water and alcohol. Heat destroys its  green color in solutions; alkalies, in the presence of cold, increase  it. The leaves and the bark of the plant contain an essential oil.    The foregoing description of this species applies equally well to  the following species.    Botanical Description.--A small tree 12° high with leaves alternate,  odd-pinnate. Leaflets lanceolate, almost entire, rigid with small  dots on each surface. Flowers in axillary, very short, compound  racemes. Calyx very small, monophyllous, 5 lanceolate lobules. Corolla  much longer than the calyx, 5 lanceolate petals. Stamens 10, joined,  but not entirely united at the base; 5 alternate stamens longer than  the others. Anthers sessile, regular. Ovary superior, compressed and  borne on a disc. Style 1, same length as the stamens. Stigma thick,  depressed, apparently 4-angled. Fruit fleshy, ovoid, acute and somewhat  curved at the end enclosing a seed with coriaceous, downy testa.        _Murraya Koenigi_, Spreng. (_Bergera Koenigi_, L.; _Connarus_ sp.,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--(?)    Botanical Description.--Leaves alternate, odd-pinnate. Leaflets  obliquely ovate, acute, entire and glabrous. The testa of the seed  bears no down, and may be divided into two parts. The decoction of  the leaves of this species as well as the former is used to allay  toothache.        _Citrus acida_, F. (_C. notissima_, Blanco.)    Nom.
