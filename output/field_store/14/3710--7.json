THE MOTION OF A PLANET.--In Fig. 20 _S_ represents the sun and _P_ a  planet or other celestial body, which for the moment is moving along the  straight line _P 1_. In accordance with the first law of motion it would  continue to move along this line with uniform velocity if no external  force acted upon it; but such a force, the sun's attraction, is acting,  and by virtue of this attraction the body is pulled aside from the line  _P 1_.    Knowing the velocity and direction of the body's motion and the force  with which the sun attracts it, the mathematician is able to apply  Newton's laws of motion so as to determine the path of the body, and a  few of the possible orbits are shown in the figure where the short cross  stroke marks the point of each orbit which is nearest to the sun. This  point is called the _perihelion_.    Without any formal application of mathematics we may readily see that  the swifter the motion of the body at _P_ the shorter will be the time  during which it is subjected to the sun's attraction at close range, and  therefore the force exerted by the sun, and the resulting change of  motion, will be small, as in the orbits _P 1_ and _P 2_.    On the other hand, _P 5_ and _P 6_ represent orbits in which the  velocity at _P_ was comparatively small, and the resulting change of  motion greater than would be possible for a more swiftly moving body.    What would be the orbit if the velocity at _P_ were reduced to nothing  at all?    What would be the effect if the body starting at _P_ moved directly away  from _1_?    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Different kinds of orbits.]    The student should not fail to observe that the sun's attraction tends  to pull the body at _P_ forward along its path, and therefore increases  its velocity, and that this influence continues until the planet reaches  perihelion, at which point it attains its greatest velocity, and the  force of the sun's attraction is wholly expended in changing the  direction of its motion. After the planet has passed perihelion the sun  begins to pull backward and to retard the motion in just the same  measure that before perihelion passage it increased it, so that the two  halves of the orbit on opposite sides of a line drawn from the  perihelion through the sun are exactly alike. We may here note the  explanation of Kepler's second law: when the planet is near the sun it  moves faster, and the radius vector changes its direction more rapidly  than when the planet is remote from the sun on account of the greater  force with which it is attracted, and the exact relation between the  rates at which the radius vector turns in different parts of the orbit,  as given by the second law, depends upon the changes in this force.    When the velocity is not too great, the sun's backward pull, after a  planet has passed perihelion, finally overcomes it and turns the planet  toward the sun again, in such a way that it comes back to the point _P_,  moving in the same direction and with the same speed as before--i. e.,  it has gone around the sun in an orbit like _P 6_ or _P 4_, an ellipse,  along which it will continue to move ever after. But we must not fail to  note that this return into the same orbit is a consequence of the last  line in the statement of the law of gravitation (p. 54), and that, if  the magnitude of this force were inversely as the cube of the distance  or any other proportion than the square, the orbit would be something  very different. If the velocity is too great for the sun's attraction to  overcome, the orbit will be a hyperbola, like _P 2_, along which the  body will move away never to return, while a velocity just at the limit  of what the sun can control gives an orbit like _P 3_, a parabola, along  which the body moves with _parabolic velocity_, which is ever  diminishing as the body gets farther from the sun, but is always just  sufficient to keep it from returning. If the earth's velocity could be  increased 41 per cent, from 19 up to 27 miles per second, it would have  parabolic velocity, and would quit the sun's company.    The summation of the whole matter is that the orbit in which a body  moves around the sun, or past the sun, depends upon its velocity and if  this velocity and the direction of the motion at any one point in the  orbit are known the whole orbit is determined by them, and the position  of the planet in its orbit for past as well as future times can be  determined through the application of Newton's laws; and the same is  true for any other heavenly body--moon, comet, meteor, etc. It is in  this way that astronomers are able to predict, years in advance, in what  particular part of the sky a given planet will appear at a given time.    It is sometimes a source of wonder that the planets move in ellipses  instead of circles, but it is easily seen from Fig. 20 that the planet,  _P_, could not by any possibility move in a circle, since the direction  of its motion at _P_ is not at right angles with the line joining it to  the sun as it must be in a circular orbit, and even if it were  perpendicular to the radius vector the planet must needs have exactly  the right velocity given to it at this point, since either more or less  speed would change the circle into an ellipse. In order to produce  circular motion there must be a balancing of conditions as nice as is  required to make a pin stand upon its point, and the really surprising  thing is that the orbits of the planets should be so nearly circular as  they are. If the orbit of the earth were drawn accurately to scale, the  untrained eye would not detect the slightest deviation from a true  circle, and even the orbit of Mercury (Fig. 17), which is much more  eccentric than that of the earth, might almost pass for a circle.    [Illustration: FIG. 21. An impossible orbit.]    The orbit _P 2_, which lies between the parabola and the straight line,  is called in geometry a hyperbola, and Newton succeeded in proving from  the law of gravitation that a body might move under the sun's attraction  in a hyperbola as well as in a parabola or ellipse; but it must move in  some one of these curves; no other orbit is possible.[1] Thus it would  not be possible for a body moving under the law of gravitation to  describe about the sun any such orbit as is shown in Fig. 21. If the  body passes a second time through any point of its orbit, such as _P_ in  the figure, then it must retrace, time after time, the whole path that  it first traversed in getting from _P_ around to _P_ again--i. e., the  orbit must be an ellipse.      [1] The circle and straight line are considered to be special cases        of these curves, which, taken collectively, are called the conic        sections.    Newton also proved that Kepler's three laws are mere corollaries from  the law of gravitation, and that to be strictly correct the third law  must be slightly altered so as to take into account the masses of the  planets. These are, however, so small in comparison with that of the  sun, that the correction is of comparatively little moment.    39. PERTURBATIONS.--In what precedes we have considered the motion of a  planet under the influence of no other force than the sun's attraction,  while in fact, as the law of gravitation asserts, every other body in  the universe is in some measure attracting it and changing its motion.  The resulting disturbances in the motion of the attracted body are  called _perturbations_, but for the most part these are insignificant,  because the bodies by whose disturbing attractions they are caused are  either very small or very remote, and it is only when our moving planet,  _P_, comes under the influence of some great disturbing power like  Jupiter or one of the other planets that the perturbations caused by  their influence need to be taken into account.    The problem of the motion of three bodies--sun, Jupiter, planet--which  must then be dealt with is vastly more complicated than that which we  have considered, and the ablest mathematicians and astronomers have not  been able to furnish a complete solution for it, although they have  worked upon the problem for two centuries, and have developed an immense  amount of detailed information concerning it.    [Illustration: THE LICK OBSERVATORY, MOUNT HAMILTON, CAL.]    In general each planet works ceaselessly upon the orbit of every other,  changing its size and shape and position, backward and forward in  accordance with the law of gravitation, and it is a question of serious  moment how far this process may extend. If the diameter of the earth's  orbit were very much increased or diminished by the perturbing action of  the other planets, the amount of heat received from the sun would be  correspondingly changed, and the earth, perhaps, be rendered unfit  for the support of life. The tipping of the plane of the earth's orbit  into a new position might also produce serious consequences; but the  great French mathematician of a century ago, Laplace, succeeded in  proving from the law of gravitation that although both of these changes  are actually in progress they can not, at least for millions of years,  go far enough to prove of serious consequence, and the same is true for  all the other planets, unless here and there an asteroid may prove an  exception to the rule.    The precession (Chapter V) is a striking illustration of a perturbation  of slightly different character from the above, and another is found in  connection with the plane of the moon's orbit. It will be remembered  that the moon in its motion among the stars never goes far from the  ecliptic, but in a complete circuit of the heavens crosses it twice,  once in going from south to north and once in the opposite direction.  The points at which it crosses the ecliptic are called the _nodes_, and  under the perturbing influence of the sun these nodes move"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#11)"],[1," rodents; while in the sandy  sage areas nearby 200 trap-nights yielded only one _eremicus_ and 32  other rodents.    In lower San Antonio Canyon _eremicus_ seemed restricted to the rocky  canyon bottom, none having been trapped on the steep slopes nearby. This  subspecies occurs commonly, however, on the adobe banks grown to white  sage at the base of the foothills. There _eremicus_ occurred on common  ground with _Perognathus fallax fallax_, and was often the only  _Peromyscus_ taken.    This species may be restricted by temperature; washes above 4000 feet  elevation, which seemed suitable were uninhabited by these mice.    On December 1, 1949, two females taken at the mouth of Palmer Canyon had  well advanced embryos. A female trapped in San Antonio Canyon on  September 19, 1951, was lactating. Juveniles were caught in the sage  belt in October, 1951.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 6, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon, 2500 ft., 1; San Antonio      Wash, 1800 ft., 5 (PC).      =Peromyscus californicus insignis= Rhoads    California Mouse    This mouse inhabits areas supporting chaparral on the coastal slope of  the San Gabriels below 5000 feet. In the chaparral it is usually the  most plentiful rodent, being dominant on slopes which have been burned  over and on which greasewood chaparral has taken over. On one such slope  at the head of Cow Canyon, at 4500 feet, this was the only rodent  trapped, although an occasional wood rat house was noted. Trapping  records gave the impression that this form was the most ubiquitous  rodent in the entire chaparral belt. Nearly every trap line, even in  such non-productive areas as oak woodland, took the California mouse;  and in many areas, as in thick lilac brush, this mouse was by far the  most abundant rodent. Specimens were taken on the damp ground next to  San Antonio Creek, and in the riparian growth. In San Antonio Wash the  California mouse was found in thickets of laurel sumac and lemonade  berry, or other large shrubs, but were absent from most of the adjacent  sageland. The one place where they were found away from heavy brush was  on a series of barren adobe banks, near Palmer Canyon, clothed mostly  with white sage. Here they found shelter in the unused burrows of  kangaroo rats and ground squirrels.    The only place on the desert slope where this species was taken was in  Mescal Wash. There it was taken occasionally near the large clumps of  antelope-brush and manzanita which grew in the main channels of the  wash.    Lactating females of this species were taken in October, 1949, and  February, 1950. Two pregnant females were trapped on February 25, 1950,  at the mouth of Palmer Canyon.        _Specimens examined._--Total 16, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Wash (4200 ft., 4; 4300 ft., 1; 4500 ft.,      1), 6(2IM); San Antonio Canyon, 4500 ft., 1; San Antonio Canyon,      3000 ft., 5; mouth of Palmer Canyon, 1900 ft., 4 (PC).      =Peromyscus maniculatus gambeli= (Baird)    Deer Mouse    This species occurs from 1000 feet elevation to above 9000 feet  elevation on the Pacific slope of the Mountains, but although probably  the most widespread rodent in the area it is absent from many habitats.  This mouse reaches maximum abundance in the coastal sage scrub  association, particularly where the soil is sandy with scattered  vegetation--usually coastal sagebrush and black sage. On the foothill  adobe slopes none was trapped, nor have any been taken in most of the  chaparral habitats. A few _gambeli_ were trapped amid the talus beneath  growths of scrub oak and bay trees in San Antonio Canyon, at 4300 feet  elevation. On Blue Ridge, at elevations of from 7200 feet to 8300 feet,  this mouse inhabited areas clothed with snowbush, basin sagebrush,  currant, and scattered conifers, and was found sparingly in the  coniferous forests. Thus this species lives on contrasting soil types in  association with many different vegetational assemblages, from the  coastal base to the crest of the range.    There is a rather wide variation in color in _gambeli_ from the San  Gabriels. Certain individuals taken in open, sandy coastal sage areas  are pale, some being indistinguishable from examples of _sonoriensis_  taken in the pinyon-juniper association on the desert slope. Specimens  from San Antonio Canyon have somewhat darker pelage than those from the  sage belt, and than individuals taken on Blue Ridge. Possibly a large  series of _Peromyscus maniculatus_ from the San Gabriel Mountains would  show definite local trends in color of pelage.    This species is active on sub-freezing and rainy nights as evidenced by  trapping results, and at Big Pines there were tracks around the bases of  conifers after a heavy snowfall in December, 1951. Several females  taken in the sage belt in October, 1948, carried embryos, and a  lactating female was recorded from Blue Ridge on November 13, 1951.  Juveniles have been taken in September, October, November, and December.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 9, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 1 mi. S and 2 mi. W Big Pines, 7400 ft., 3; 1      mi. S and 2 mi. E Big Pines, 8200 ft., 1; 4 mi. NE Claremont,      1900 ft., 2; San Antonio Wash, 1800 ft., 3 (PC).      =Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis= (Le Conte)    Deer Mouse    This subspecies is associated with contrasting types of soil and  vegetation. It is seemingly absent from the upper pinyon-juniper sage  flats and areas grown to chaparral, but is fairly common on the gravelly  benches dotted with junipers, and in the washes issuing from the canyons  on the desert slope. It is present in small numbers in the Joshua tree  association.    In 1951 the numbers of _sonoriensis_ were noticeably less than in 1948;  probably this was correlated with the series of dry winters in this  period. In December, 1948, this animal was one of the most common  rodents in Mescal Wash, 200 trap-nights yielding thirteen specimens; but  in November, 1951, none was taken. In parts of the juniper belt, where  an average of about six _sonoriensis_ was taken per 100 trap-nights in  1948, the average had dropped to one per 100 trap-nights in 1951.    Specimens of this species from the desert slope of the mountains have  been assigned to the subspecies _sonoriensis_. Those from Blue Ridge  tend toward _sonoriensis_ in color, and may be considered as intergrades  between this subspecies and _gambeli_.    This species was active on nights when the temperature was as low as 10 deg.  F., and individuals were trapped in the juniper belt in December, 1948,  when four inches of snow lay on the ground.    Gray-pelaged juveniles were taken on the desert slope in December, 1948,  and a female taken in Mescal Canyon on December 22 of this year carried  four embryos near term.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 11, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 8 mi. E and 4 mi. S Llano, 4000 ft., 6 (4 PC);      Mescal Canyon, 4800 ft., 5.      =Peromyscus boylii rowleyi= (J. A. Allen)    Brush Mouse    The main range of this mouse in the San Gabriel Mountains lies between  1600 and 6000 feet elevation on the Pacific slope of the Mountains, thus  encompassing much of the chaparral and oak woodland associations. It  was the most common mammal in the oak woodland association in the lower  foothills and often was trapped there on leaf mold beneath the oaks.  While trapping for shrews I regularly took this species in riparian  growth right down to the edge of the water. In San Antonio Canyon many  _boylii_ were trapped beneath logs and dense vegetation, and on wet  seepage slopes adjacent to the creek.    This species shows a definite predilection for rocky habitats where  these occur in the chaparral. In heavy lilac brush near Camp Baldy  _Peromyscus boylii_ was outnumbered by _P. californicus_, yet where  talus slopes or boulder piles occurred _boylii_ was more numerous. At  the head of Cow Canyon amid boulders beneath scrub oak, bay, and big  cone-spruce, this species was especially abundant and no other  _Peromyscus_ was taken.    Of special interest is the occurrence of this mouse on the desert slope  of the mountains; there it was taken beneath scrub oaks in the  pinyon-juniper association at the mouth of Mescal Canyon, and amid  boulder and debris piles in Mescal Wash at 4000 feet elevation. While  manzanita and scrub oak grew in the wash at the points of capture, the  animals were actually surrounded by the desert conditions of the Joshua  woodland, and associated with such desert forms as _Onychomys torridus  pulcher_ and _Peromyscus eremicus eremicus_.    Immature individuals were taken in October, November, February, and  March, and a female with two large embryos was taken near Icehouse  Canyon on November 8, 1951.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 8, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Wash, 4000 ft., 1; Mescal Canyon, 4800      ft., 2; San Antonio Canyon, 5200 ft., 2; San Antonio Canyon,      4500 ft., 1; San Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 1; Thompson Canyon,      1800 ft., 1 (PC).      =Peromyscus truei montipinoris= Elliot    Pinon Mouse    Only once was this mouse found outside the pinyon-juniper association of  the desert slope; in November, 1949, several were collected near Cajon  in mixed manzanita, scrub oak, and greasewood chaparral. This was the  only _Peromyscus_ of regular occurrence in the pinyon-juniper area, and  was recorded from the upper limit of this association, near Jackson  Lake, at 6000 feet, to the lower limit of the association at the mouth  of Graham Canyon at roughly 4000 feet elevation.    Although in the juniper belt _truei_ often occurs on common ground  with _Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis_, the habitat preferences of  these animals are generally complementary. Where the mice occur  together, traps set in a variety of locations caught _Peromyscus  maniculatus_, but typically"]]]
