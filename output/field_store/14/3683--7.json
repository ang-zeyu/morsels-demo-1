By nine o'clock, Swift had exhausted the spot, and was for pushing on to  the westward to complete the perplexing circle if necessary. Perhaps an  entrance might be forced elsewhere. He was sitting in his buggy with Mr.  Ticks, who was as uncommunicative as the dasher when he looked for the  hundredth time towards the Buzzard mountains. As he gazed he saw turkey  buzzards, of which there are thousands in that land, wheeling their  spiral flight above the afflicted territory. Swift looked at them as he  always did, wondering how they could fly so long without flapping their  wings, when suddenly he cried out:    \"By Jove! I have it!\" This startled Mr. Ticks.    \"What? Have you new information? What has occurred?\"    \"No; but I have an idea--_the_ idea--but I don't see how I could put it  through without time. I will go to Russell, or over Russell in a  balloon!\"    The light of inspiration and sympathy flashed from one to the other.    \"I congratulate you on the thought,\" said Mr. Ticks gravely. \"I think I  can procure you one in a quarter of an hour.\"    Now, under no circumstances is a balloon an easy thing to obtain. Even  in a metropolis like New York or London it will take the cleverest  reporter at least eighteen minutes, if not a few seconds longer, to hunt  up a suitable means of ascension. It is not as simple a matter as one  may suppose, to \"go up.\" Therefore, when Mr. Ticks, in a matter-of-fact  voice, asserted that he would procure the balloon in fifteen minutes,  Swift fetched a long low whistle. But not in the least disconcerted by  Swift's manner, Mr. Ticks slowly descended from the vehicle, and said:    \"Just wait here until I come back, so that no time may be lost.\" He  strode towards one of the large tents on the common and disappeared  within its flaps. Had Mr. Ticks the formula for inflating a canvas tent  into a balloon? Who knew?    In a few minutes the statistician returned, bringing with him a tall,  cadaverous man, whose leanness was heightened by a long chin beard,  which descended upon his chest to the middle button of his coat. Having  a beard of this description, the gentleman had no need of a necktie, and  having no necktie, he, of course, dispensed with a collar.    \"Professor Ariel, my friend Mr. Swift, who wishes to talk business.\" Mr.  Ticks performed the introduction in his blandest manner. The man who  seemed to see nothing had seen everything. It had taken the unpractical,  the scholar, the dreamer, the muser, to observe the broken remnants of a  county fair, and the advertisement of that aeronautic expedition,  conducted by the renowned Professor Ariel, who was to have made an  ascension at twelve o'clock that awful day, taking with him a couple to  be married in the seventh heavens and a Seventh-Day Baptist clergyman to  tie the knot. It was at ten in the morning that Russell was closed in,  and the balloon and the professor had been ignominiously forgotten.    \"Where is your balloon, professor?\" asked Swift, when he had learned  these preliminary details.    \"Darn it all, in that barn there!\" The professor spoke as if he had a  personal grievance against the barn.    \"Are--were they to have paid you for your ascension?\"    \"Five hundred dollars, and I hain't seen a red, and I can't get out of  this infernal place.\"    \"I suppose it is in good condition?\" inquired the editor.    \"You bet! It's new. Never been used. Cost twenty-five hundred dollars.  Cash!\"    \"How long would it take you to get her ready?\"    \"Three hours' pushing would do it, I suppose.\"    \"We want to go up in that balloon, Professor Ariel,\" said Swift, after  deliberation. Mr. Ticks confirmed this demand with an affirmative  gesture of his sad head.    \"Can't be done, sir. I wouldn't risk her in this crowd!\"    The professor spoke decisively.    \"Do you know who we are?\"    The professor shook his head.    \"We are here representing the _Daily Planet_, and it will be the biggest  advertisement you ever had.\"    The professor still shook his head doubtfully.    \"If you were the President and all his angels I wouldn't risk it. A  counter-current might carry us over that cussed spot, and we'd all be  stiff before you could say Jinks.\"    Nothing daunted, Swift took the aeronaut by the arm, offered him a  cigar, and pointed towards the Buzzard mountains.    \"That's just where we want to go. D'ye see those birds up there? If they  can stand it we can. This deadly what-you-call-it doesn't reach as high  as that.\"    The professor stared and then muttered to himself:    \"Gee--mima! The feller's hit it right.\"    \"Now, look here, professor! You're a famous man. Everybody knows _you_.  The _Planet_ charters your balloon for five hundred dollars. Is it a  go?\"    The professor's eyes glittered yellow, the color of greed.    \"I couldn't think of it. I couldn't risk the danger. It's an unknown  country, now--no, I couldn't.\"    \"Call it six hundred.\"    \"Impos-sible!\"    \"Seven!\"    \"That wouldn't pay me if she breaks.\"    \"Eight hundred dollars!\"    \"Couldn't do it.\"    \"Nine hundred dollars. I'm tired.\"    \"Subtract eight and add a cipher, and I'm your man.\"    \"Very well! Mr. Ticks is witness. I will give you five hundred when we  leave the ground, and the balance when we touch it again.\"    \"Done!\"    The two men shook hands over their bargain.    \"Let me see,\" said Swift, glancing at his watch, \"it is ten o'clock. We  will ascend at one.\"    \"I will assist the professor in preparing his airship,\" said Mr. Ticks.  \"By the way, how tall is your balloon, professor? What is her cognomen?\"    \"I call her _High Tariff_, mister. That's her name. You'll see it on  her. Wait till she gets her forty thousand cubic feet of gas in her, and  you'll see her height.\"    By twelve o'clock the multitude had got wind of the undertaking, and  were thronging towards the fenced enclosure, where the huge monster was  flapping with that inane motion that only a half-filled balloon can take  to itself. Rumors of the wildest description were afloat. By half-past  twelve the balloon was, to all appearance, full, and sandbags were being  put aboard. By one the crowd could hardly be kept back by self-sworn  marshals, and the balloon tugged at its warps as if it would burst its  bonds at the slightest provocation.    The _High Tariff_ now awakened the utmost enthusiasm. Men came by tens  and hundreds to make offers for the risky trip.    \"Blank it all, she's chartered, the _High Tariff_ is,\" was the  aeronaut's invariable reply. \"She don't belong to me this trip. Ask the  owners.\"    At ten minutes after one precisely Swift appeared upon the ground. He  had just sent off the following message to his paper:         \"_Start immediately for Russell by thousand dollar balloon._\"    He had sold his horse and team and had purchased provisions with the  proceeds. Five minutes after the sale the horse backed into the hotel  and smashed the buggy into Chinese joss-sticks.    Swift walked calmly to the car and ordered the provisions aboard.    \"Have you a long ladder and grapnel?\" he inquired.    \"Two hundred and fifty feet each.\"    \"Anchor?\"    \"Two hundred pounds.\"    \"Are you ready, professor?\" asked Swift, satisfied with his inspection.    \"She's full to bustin'!\" said the professor, looking uneasily at the  straining cable.    \"Jump in, Mr. Ticks!\" The crowd was almost beside itself at the boldness  of the undertaking. Men yelled and hooted encouragement as the venerable  and musty editor stepped into the car with a natural air. It took more  than this to embarrass Mr. Ticks.    \"Now, professor!\" As Swift spoke he handed the professor a draft on the  _Planet_ for five hundred dollars. The professor hesitated no longer. He  snatched the check and bounded in. An assistant stood ready with an axe  to cut the ropes that held the impatient balloon. Swift then stepped in  leisurely. It was just twenty-nine minutes and a quarter past one  o'clock. The crowd shrieked as if their throats would burst. Swift  lifted his hat in acknowledgment.    \"Good luck!\"    \"Never say die!\"    \"Come back and tell us all about it.\"    \"If you see my husband tell him I'm waiting for him.\"    They cheered and yelled and cried and cheered again.    \"Are you ready?\" asked Swift, looking at his companions.    \"Then let her go!\"    A cut, a swirl, an indescribable motion, and shouts became to those in  the _High Tariff_ whispers, men became ants, and they were gone.          V.      \"Look! For God's sake, look! What is it?\"    Swift strained his eyes to the southward, toward the death-bound  territory. The malignant cloud that settled over plain and mountain  slope was broken on the Gopher lake. As soon as Swift had recovered from  the first bound of the balloon he had scanned the dark mist, and by the  borders of the lake he had found a rift. This rift indicated the spot  where the city of Russell should have been. As he spoke he clutched the  arm of his colleague, and pointed over the side of the rising car.    \"I--I'm afraid I can't see what you mean,\" stammered Mr. Statis Ticks,  \"my glasses are blurred.\"    The man of figures was really agitated. But Professor Ariel, like many  an adventurer, had more than his share of what one may politely call  sang-froid, but what is known in common North American as simple  \"cheek.\" Besides, in some sections of the country, he might have been  called a profane man. With his hands on the safety valve, he looked and  then ejaculated:    \"By ----. It's gone!\"    \"I see nothing--nothing but black streaks,\" said the elder member of the  _Planet_ corps hurriedly. \"Can't we stop, professor? Perhaps that isn't  the site of the unfortunate city!\"    The professor, obedient to the suggestion, pulled the safety valve, and  the gas rushed out with a wheeze.    \"You bet it is! That's the place! Didn't I land there before I struck  Empiria? Darned lucky for me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#11)"],[1," and returned not to pause till he gained  his own habitation. Having armed himself anew, and taken a companion  with him, he again repaired to the spot, where he found the bear lying  dead on the ground, some of the shots having entered her heart.    The American black bear lives a solitary life in forests and  uncultivated deserts, and subsists on fruits, and on the young shoots  and roots of vegetables. Of honey he is exceedingly fond, and, as he is  a most expert climber, he scales the loftiest trees in search of it.  Fish, too, he delights in, and is often found in quest of them, on the  borders of lakes and on the sea-shore. When these resources fail, he  will attack small quadrupeds, and even animals of some magnitude. As,  indeed, is usual in such cases, the love of flesh, in him, grows with  the use of it.    As the fur is of some value, the Indians are assiduous in the chase of  the creature which produces it. \"About the end of December, from the  abundance of fruits they find in Louisiana and the neighboring  countries, the bears become so fat and lazy that they can scarcely run.  At this time they are hunted by the Indians. The nature of the chase is  generally this: the bear chiefly adopts, for his retreat, the hollow  trunk of an old cypress-tree, which he climbs, and then descends into  the cavity from above. The hunter, whose business it is to watch him  into this retreat, climbs a neighboring tree, and seats himself  opposite to the hole. In one hand he holds his gun, and in the other a  torch, which he darts into the cavity. Frantic with rage and terror,  the bear makes a spring from his station; but the hunter seizes the  instant of his appearance, and shoots him.    \"The pursuit of the bear is a matter of the first importance to some of  the Indian tribes, and is never undertaken without much ceremony. A  principal warrior gives a general invitation to all the hunters. This  is followed by a strict fast of eight days, in which they totally  abstain from food, but during which the day is passed in continual  song. This is done to invoke the spirits of the woods to direct the  hunters to the places where there are abundance of bears. They even cut  the flesh in divers parts of their bodies, to render the spirits more  propitious. They also address themselves to the manes of the beasts  slain in the preceding chases, and implore these to direct them, in  their dreams, to an abundance of game. The chief of the hunt now gives  a great feast, at which no one dares to appear without first bathing.  At this entertainment, contrary to their usual custom, they eat with  great moderation. The master of the feast touches nothing, but is  employed in relating to the guests ancient tales of feasts in former  chases; and fresh invocations to the manes of the deceased bears  conclude the whole.    \"They then sally forth, equipped as if for war, and painted black. They  proceed on their way in a direct line, not allowing rivers, marshes, or  any other impediment, to stop their course, and driving before them all  the beasts they find. When they arrive at the hunting-ground, they  surround as large a space as they can, and then contract their circle,  searching, at the same time, every hollow tree, and every place capable  of being the retreat of a bear; and they continue the same practice  till the chase is expired.    \"As soon as a bear is killed, a hunter puts into his mouth a lighted  pipe of tobacco, and, blowing into it, fills the throat with the smoke,  conjuring the spirit of the animal not to resent what they are about to  do to its body, or to render their future chases unsuccessful. As the  beast makes no reply, they cut out the string of the tongue, and throw  it into the fire. If it crackle and shrivel up, which it is almost sure  to do, they accept this as a good omen; if not, they consider that the  spirit of the beast is not appeased, and that the chase of the next  year will be unfortunate.\"    When our forefathers first settled in America, bears were common in all  parts of the country along the Atlantic. Many adventures with them took  place, some of which are recorded in the histories of the times. The  following is said to have occurred at a later period:--    Some years since, when the western part of New York was in a state of  nature, and wolves and bears were not afraid of being seen, some  enterprising pilgrim had erected, and put in operation, a sawmill, on  the banks of the Genesee. One day, as he was sitting on the log, eating  his bread and cheese, a large, black bear came from the woods towards  the mill. The man, leaving his luncheon on the log, made a spring, and  seated himself on a beam above; when the bear, mounting the log, sat  down with his rump towards the saw, which was in operation, and  commenced satisfying his appetite on the man's dinner. After a little  while, the saw progressed enough to interfere with the hair on bruin's  back, and he hitched along a little, and kept on eating. Again the saw  came up, and scratched a little flesh. The bear then whirled about,  and, throwing his paws around the saw, held on, till he was mangled  through and through, when he rolled off, fell through into the flood,  and bled to death.    The GRISLY BEAR.--This creature, which is peculiar to North America,  is, perhaps, the most formidable of the bruin family in magnitude and  ferocity. He averages twice the bulk of the black bear, to which,  however, he bears some resemblance in his slightly elevated forehead,  and narrow, flattened, elongated muzzle. His canine teeth are of great  size and power. The feet are enormously large--the breadth of the fore  foot exceeding nine inches, and the length of the hind foot, exclusive  of the talons, being eleven inches and three quarters, and its breadth  seven inches. The talons sometimes measure more than six inches. He is,  accordingly, admirably adapted for digging up the ground, but is unable  to climb trees, in which latter respect he differs wholly from most  other species. The color of his hair varies to almost an indefinite  extent, between all the intermediate shades of a light gray and a black  brown; the latter tinge, however, being that which predominates. It is  always in some degree grizzled, by intermixture of grayish hairs. The  hair itself is, in general, longer, finer, and more exuberant, than  that of the black bear.    The neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains is one of the principal haunts  of this animal. There, amidst wooded plains, and tangled copses of  bough and underwood, he reigns as much the monarch as the lion is of  the sandy wastes of Africa. Even the bison cannot withstand his  attacks. Such is his muscular strength, that he will drag the ponderous  carcass of the animal to a convenient spot, where he digs a pit for its  reception. The Indians regard him with the utmost terror. His extreme  tenacity of life renders him still more dangerous; for he can endure  repeated wounds which would be instantaneously mortal to other beasts,  and, in that state, can rapidly pursue his enemy; so that the hunter  who fails to shoot him through the brain is placed in a most perilous  situation.    One evening, the men in the hindmost of one of Lewis and Clark's canoes  perceived one of these bears lying in the open ground, about three  hundred paces from the river; and six of them, who were all good  hunters, went to attack him. Concealing themselves by a small eminence,  they were able to approach within forty paces unperceived; four of the  hunters now fired, and each lodged a ball in his body, two of which  passed directly through the lungs. The bear sprang up, and ran  furiously, with open mouth, upon them; two of the hunters, who had  reserved their fire, gave him two additional wounds, and one, breaking  his shoulder-blade, somewhat retarded his motions. Before they could  again load their guns, he came so close on them, that they were obliged  to run towards the river, and before they had gained it, the bear had  almost overtaken them. Two men jumped into the canoe; the other four  separated, and, concealing themselves among the willows, fired as fast  as they could load their pieces. Several times the bear was struck, but  each shot seemed only to direct his fury towards the hunters; at last  he pursued them so closely that they threw aside their guns and  pouches, and jumped from a perpendicular bank, twenty feet high, into  the river. The bear sprang after them, and was very near the hindmost  man, when one of the hunters on the shore shot him through the head,  and finally killed him. When they dragged him on shore, they found that  eight balls had passed through his body in different directions.    Richardson relates the following story of a grisly bear. A party of  voyagers, who had been employed all day in tracking a canoe up the  Saskatchewan, had seated themselves, in the twilight, by a fire, and  were busy in preparing their supper, when a large grisly bear sprang  over their canoe that was behind them, and, seizing one of the party by  the shoulder, carried him off. The rest fled in terror, with the  exception of a man named Bourasso, who, grasping his gun, followed the  bear as it was retreating leisurely with its prey. He called to his  unfortunate comrade that he was afraid of hitting him if he fired at  the bear; but the latter entreated him to fire immediately, as the  animal was squeezing him to death. On this he took a deliberate aim,  and discharged his piece into the body of the bear, which instantly  dropped its prey to pursue Bourasso. He escaped with difficulty, and  the bear retreated to a thicket, where it is supposed to have died. The  man who was rescued had his arm fractured, and was otherwise severely  bitten by the bear, but finally recovered.    The WHITE BEAR.--The polar bear is considerably larger than the brown  or black bear, and is covered with a long, thick fur, of a bright white  "]]]
