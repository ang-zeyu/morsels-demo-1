This magazine was followed by many others, of which Mrs.  Kirkland, Mrs. Osgood, Mrs. Ellet, Mrs. Sigourney, and women of like  character were editors or contributors. These early magazines  published many steel and colored engravings, not only of fashions, but  reproductions of works of art, giving the first important impulse to  the art of engraving in this country.    Many other periodicals and papers by women now appeared over the  country. Mrs. Anne Royal edited for a quarter of a century a paper  called _The Huntress_. In 1827 Lydia Maria Child published a paper for  children called _The Juvenile Miscellany_, and in 1841 assumed the  editorship of _The Anti-Slavery Standard_, in New York, which she ably  conducted for eight years. _The Dial_, in Boston, a transcendental  quarterly, edited by Margaret Fuller, made its appearance in 1840; its  contributors, among whom were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott,  Theodore Parker, Wm. H. Channing, and the nature-loving Thoreau, were  some of the most profound thinkers of the time. Charlotte Fowler  Wells, the efficient coadjutor of her brothers and husband for the  last forty-two years in the management of _The Phrenological Journal_  and Publishing House of Fowler & Wells in New York city, and since her  husband's death in 1875 the sole proprietor and general manager, has  also conducted an extensive correspondence and written occasional  articles for the _Journal. The Lowell Offering_, edited by the \"mill  girls\" of that manufacturing town, was established in 1840, and  exercised a wide influence. It lived till 1849. Its articles were  entirely written by the girl operatives, among whom may be mentioned  Lucy Larcom, Margaret Foley, the sculptor, who recently died in Rome;  Lydia S. Hall, who at one time filled an important clerkship in the  United States Treasury, and Harriet J. Hansan, afterward the wife of  W. S. Robinson (Warrington), and herself one of the present workers in  Woman Suffrage. Harriet F. Curtis, author of two popular novels, and  Harriet Farley, both \"mill girls,\" had entire editorial charge during  the latter part of its existence. In Vermont, Clarina Howard Nichols  edited the _Windham County Democrat_ from 1843 to 1853. It was a  political paper of a pronounced character; her husband was the  publisher. Jane G. Swisshelm edited _The Saturday Visitor_, at  Pittsburg, Pa., in 1848. Also the same year _The True Kindred_  appeared, by Rebecca Sanford, at Akron, Ohio. _The Lily_, a temperance  monthly, was started in Seneca Falls, N. Y., in 1849, by Amelia  Bloomer, as editor and publisher. It also advocated Woman's Rights,  and attained a circulation in nearly every State and Territory of the  Union. _The Sybil_ soon followed, Dr. Lydia Sayre Hasbrook, editor;  also _The Pledge of Honor_, edited by N. M. Baker and E. Maria  Sheldon, Adrian, Michigan.    In 1849, _Die Frauen Zeitung_, edited by Mathilde Franceska Anneke,  was published in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1850, Lydia Jane Pierson  edited a column of the _Lancaster_ (Pa.) _Gazette_; Mrs. Prewett  edited the _Yazoo_ (Miss.) _Whig_, in Mississippi; and Mrs. Sheldon  the _Dollar Weekly_. In 1851, Julia Ward Howe edited, with her  husband, _The Commonwealth_, a newspaper dedicated to free thought,  and zealous for the liberty of the slave. In 1851, Mrs. C. C. Bentley  was editor of the _Concord Free Press_, in Vermont, and Elizabeth  Aldrich of the _Genius of Liberty_, in Ohio. In 1852, Anna W. Spencer  started the _Pioneer and Woman's Advocate_, in Providence, R. I. Its  motto was, \"Liberty, Truth, Temperance, Equality.\" It was published  semi-monthly, and advocated a better education for woman, a higher  price for her labor, the opening of new industries. It was the  earliest paper established in the United States for the advocacy of  Woman's Rights. In 1853, _The Una_, a paper devoted to the  enfranchisement of woman, owned and edited by Paulina Wright Davis,  was first published in Providence, but afterward removed to Boston,  where Caroline H. Dall became associate editor. In 1855, Anna McDowell  founded _The Woman's Advocate_ in Philadelphia, a paper in which, like  that of Mrs. Anna Franklin, the owner, editor, and compositors were  all women. About this period many well-known literary women filled  editorial chairs. Grace Greenwood started a child's paper called _The  Little Pilgrim_; Mrs. Bailey conducted the _Era_, an anti-slavery  paper, in Washington, D. C., after her husband's death.    In 1868, _The Revolution_, a pronounced Woman's Rights paper, was  started in New York city; Susan B. Anthony, publisher and proprietor,  Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury, editors. Its motto,  \"Principles, not policy; justice, not favor; men, their rights and  nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less.\" In 1870 it passed  into the hands of Laura Curtis Bullard, who edited it two years with  the assistance of Phebe Carey and Augusta Larned, and in 1872 it found  consecrated burial in _The Liberal Christian_, the leading Unitarian  paper in New York. From the advent of _The Revolution_ can be dated a  new era in the woman suffrage movement. Its brilliant, aggressive  columns attracted the comments of the press, and drew the attention of  the country to the reform so ably advocated. Many other papers devoted  to the discussion of woman's enfranchisement soon arose. In 1869, _The  Pioneer_, in San Francisco, Cal., Emily Pitts Stevens, editor and  proprietor. _The Woman's Advocate_, at Dayton, O., A. J. Boyer and  Miriam M. Cole, editors, started the same year. _The Sorosis_ and _The  Agitator_, in Chicago, Ill., the latter owned and edited by Mary A.  Livermore, and _The Woman's Advocate_, in New York, were all alike  short-lived. _L'Amerique_, a semi-weekly French paper published in  Chicago, Ill., by Madam Jennie d'Hericourt, and _Die Neue Zeit_, a  German paper, in New York, by Mathilde F. Wendt, this same year, show  the interest of our foreign women citizens in the cause of their sex.  In 1870, _The Woman's Journal_ was founded in Boston, Lucy Stone,  Julia Ward Howe, and Henry B. Blackwell, editors. _Woodhull and  Claflin's Weekly_, an erratic paper, advocating many new ideas, was  established in New York by Victoria Woodhull and Tennie C. Claflin,  editors and proprietors. _The New Northwest_, in Portland, Oregon, in  1871, Abigail Scott Duniway, editor and proprietor. _The Golden Dawn_,  at San Francisco, Cal., in 1876, Mrs. Boyer, editor.    _The Ballot-Box_ was started in 1876, at Toledo, O., Sarah Langdon  Williams, editor, under the auspices of the city Woman's Suffrage  Association. It was moved to Syracuse in 1878, and is now edited by  Matilda Joslyn Gage, under the name of _The National Citizen and  Ballot-Box_, as an exponent of the views of the National Woman  Suffrage Association. Its motto, \"Self-government is a natural right,  and the ballot is the method of exercising that right.\" Laura de Force  Gordon for some years edited a daily democratic paper in California.  In opposition to this large array of papers demanding equality for  woman, a solitary little monthly was started a few years since, in  Baltimore, Md., under the auspices of Mrs. General Sherman and Mrs.  Admiral Dahlgren. It was called _The True Woman_, but soon died of  inanition and inherent weakness of constitution.    In the Exposition of 1876, in Philadelphia, the _New Century_, edited  and published under the auspices of the Woman's Centennial Committee,  was made-up and printed by women on a press of their own, in the  Woman's Pavilion. In 1877 Mrs. Theresa Lewis started _Woman's Words_  in Philadelphia. For some time, Penfield, N. Y., boasted its  thirteen-year-old girl editor, in Miss Nellie Williams. Her paper, the  _Penfield Enterprise_, was for three years written, set up, and  published by herself. It attained a circulation of three thousand.    Many foreign papers devoted to woman's interests have been established  within the last few years. The _Women's Suffrage Journal_, in England,  Lydia E. Becker, of Manchester, editor and proprietor; the  _Englishwoman's Journal_, in London, edited by Caroline Ashurst Biggs;  _Woman and Work_ and the _Victoria Magazine_, by Emily Faithful, are  among the number. Miss Faithful's magazine having attained a  circulation of fifty thousand. _Des Droits des Femmes_, long the organ  of the Swiss woman suffragists, Madame Marie Goegg, the head, was  followed by the _Solidarite_. _L'Avenir des Femmes_, edited by M. Leon  Richer, has Mlle. Maria Dairesmes, the author of a spirited reply to  the work of M. Dumas, _fils_, on Woman, as its special contributor.  _L'Esperance_, of Geneva, an Englishwoman its editor, was an early  advocate of woman's cause. _La Donna_, at Venice, edited by Signora  Gualberti Alaide Beccari (a well-known Italian philanthropic name);  _La Cornelia_, at Florence, Signora Amelia Cunino Foliero de Luna,  editor, prove Italian advancement. Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands  must not be omitted from the list of those countries which have  published Woman's Rights papers. In Lima, Peru, we find a paper edited  and controlled entirely by women; its name, _Alborada_, _i.e._, the  Dawn, a South American prophecy and herald of that dawn of justice and  equality now breaking upon the world. The Orient, likewise, shows  progress. At Bukarest, in Romaine, a paper, the _Dekebalos_, upholding  the elevation of woman, was started in 1874. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#11)"],[1,"many ambitious and earnest students play, it  would seem that they had their minds fixed upon something which could  not be conveyed to the world in any other form than that of the sounds  which come from the piano. Of course, the piano has an idiom peculiarly  its own, and some composers have employed this idiom with such natural  freedom that their music suffers when transposed for any other  instrument. The music of Chopin is peculiarly pianistic, but it is,  first of all, music, and any one of the wonderful melodies which came  from the fertile brain of the Polish-French genius could be played upon  one of many different instruments besides the piano. The duty of the  interpreter should surely be to think of the composition as such, and to  interpret it primarily as music, irrespective of the instrument. Some  students sit down before the keyboard to 'play' the piano precisely as  though they were going to play a game of cards. They have learned  certain rules governing the game, and they do not dare disobey these  rules. They think of rules rather than of the ultimate result--the  music itself. The idiom of the Italian language is appropriate here. The  Italians do not say 'I play the piano,' but rather 'I sound the piano.'  (_Suono il pianoforte._) If we had a little more 'sounding' of the  piano, that is, producing real musical effects, and a little less  playing on ivory keys, the playing of our students would be more  interesting.      VARIETY THE SPICE OF ART    \"It can hardly be questioned that the genesis of all musical art is to  be found in song, the most natural, the most fluent and the most  beautiful form of musical expression. How much every instrumentalist can  learn from the art of singing!    \"It is a physical impossibility for the voice to produce two notes in  succession exactly alike. They may sound very similar, but there is a  difference quite perceptible to the highly trained ear. When a singer  starts a phrase a certain amount of motive power is required to set the  vocal apparatus in vibration. After the first note has been attacked  with the full force of the breath, there is naturally not so much weight  or pressure left for the following notes. It is, however, possible for  the second note to be as loud, or even louder, than the first note. But  in order to obtain the additional force on the second note, it is  necessary to compensate for the lack of force due to the loss of the  original weight or pressure by increasing what might be called the  nervous energy; that is to say, by expelling the breath with  proportionately greater speed.      MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS ENERGY    \"The manifestation of nervous energy in this manner is quite different  from the manifestation of muscular energy, although both are, of course,  intimately connected. Muscular energy begins at its maximum and  gradually diminishes to the point of exhaustion, whereas nervous energy  rises in an inconceivably short space of time to its climax, and then  drops immediately to nothing. Nervous energy may be said to be  represented by an increased rapidity of emission. It is what the athlete  would call a 'spurt.'    \"What I have said about the voice applies equally to all other  instruments, the piano and the organ alone excepted. It is obvious that  the playing of the wind instruments must be subjected to the limitations  of the breath, and in the case of the violin and the other stringed  instruments, where the bow supplies the motive power, it is impossible  for two notes played in succession to sound absolutely alike. If the  first note of a phrase is attacked with the weight of the whole bow  behind it, the second note will follow with just so much less weight,  and if the violinist desires to intensify any of the succeeding tones,  he must do so by the employment of the nervous energy I have mentioned,  when a difference in the quality of tone is bound to result. The pianist  should closely observe and endeavor to imitate these characteristics,  which so vividly convey the idea of organic life in all its infinite  variety, and which are inherent in every medium for artistic expression.      PHRASING AND BREATHING    \"It would take a book, and by no means a small one, to go into this  matter of phrasing which I am now discussing. Even in such a book there  would doubtless be many points which would be open to assaults for  sticklers in psychological technology. I am not issuing a propaganda or  writing a thesis for the purpose of having something to defend, but  merely giving a few offhand facts that have benefited me in my work.  However, it is my conviction that it is the duty of the pianist to try  to understand the analogy to the physical limitations which surround the  more natural mediums of musical expression--the voice and the  violin--and to apply the result of his observations to his piano  playing.      THE NATURAL EFFECT OF EMOTIONS    \"There is another relation between phrasing and breathing which the  student may investigate to advantage. The emotions have a direct and  immediate effect upon the breath, and as the brain informs the nervous  system of new emotional impressions the visible evidences may be first  observed in the breathing. It is quite unnecessary to go into the  physiology or psychology of this, but a little reflection will  immediately indicate what I mean.    \"It is impossible to witness a disastrous accident without showing  mental agitation and excitement in hurried breathing. Joy, anger, fear,  love, tranquillity and grief--all are characterized by different modes  of breathing, and a trained actor must study this with great closeness.    \"The artist at the piano may be said to breathe his phrases. A phrase  that is purely contemplative in character is breathed in a tranquil  fashion without any suggestion of nervous agitation. If we go through  the scale of expression, starting with contemplative tranquillity, to  the climax of dramatic intensity, the breath will be emitted  progressively quicker and quicker. Every musical phrase has some kind of  expressive message to deliver. If a perfectly tranquil phrase is given  out in a succession of short breaths, indicating, as they would,  agitation, it would be a contradiction, just as it would be perfectly  inhuman to suppose that in expressing dramatic intensity it would be  possible to breathe slowly.    \"In conclusion, I would urge students to cultivate a very definite  mental attitude as to what they really desire to accomplish. Do you wish  to make music? If so, _think_ music, and nothing but music, all the  time, down to the smallest detail even in technic. Is your ambition to  play scales, octaves, double notes and trills? Then by all means  concentrate your mind on them to the exclusion of everything else, but  do not be surprised if, when, later on, you want to communicate a  semblance of life to your mechanical motions, you succeed in obtaining  no more than the jerky movements of a clock-work puppet.\"      QUESTIONS IN STYLE, INTERPRETATION, EXPRESSION  AND TECHNIC OF PIANOFORTE PLAYING    SERIES III    HAROLD BAUER    1.

BLOOMFIELD-ZEISLER]    FANNY BLOOMFIELD-ZEISLER    BIOGRAPHICAL      Mrs. Fanny Bloomfield-Zeisler was born at Beilitz, Austrian Silesia,  July 16, 1866. Two years later her parents took her to Chicago. Her  first teachers in Chicago were Bernhard Ziehn and Carl Wolfsohn. At the  age of ten she made a profound impression at a public concert in  Chicago. Two years later she had the good fortune to meet Mme. Essipoff,  who advised her to go to Vienna to study with Theodore Leschetizky.  Accordingly she was taken to the Austrian capital and remained under the  instruction of the noted pedagogue for five years. Starting with the  year 1883, she commenced a series of annual recitals and concerts in  different American cities which made her very famous. In 1893 she toured  Europe, attracting even more attention than in the homeland. Since then  she made several tours of Europe and America, arousing great enthusiasm  wherever she appeared. Her emotional force, her personal magnetism and  her keen processes of analysis compelled critics everywhere to rank her  with the foremost pianists of the day.          VI    APPEARING IN PUBLIC    FANNY BLOOMFIELD-ZEISLER      \"The secret of success in the career of a virtuoso is not easily  defined. Many elements have to be considered. Given great talent,  success is not by any means assured. Many seemingly extraneous qualities  must be cultivated; many mistakes must be avoided.    \"Let me start out with a caution. No greater mistake could possibly be  made than to assume that frequent public appearances or extended concert  touring in early youth is essential to a great career as a virtuoso. On  the contrary, I would say that such a course is positively harmful. The  'experience' of frequent playing in public is essential if one would get  rid of stage fright or undue nervousness and would gain that repose and  self-confidence without which success is impossible. But such experience  should be had only after the attainment of physical and mental maturity.  A young boy or girl, though ever so much of a prodigy, if taken on an  extensive concert tour, not only becomes unduly self-conscious,  conceited, vain and"]]]
