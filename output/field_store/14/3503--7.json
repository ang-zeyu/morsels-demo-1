It also shows the providence of God in permitting the  only men, who could have arrested the reformation, to spend their  strength in battling each other, rather than the heresy which they  deplored. Had Charles been less powerful and ambitious, he probably  would have contented himself in punishing heretics, and in uniting  with his natural ally, the pope, in suppressing every insurrection  which had for its object the rights of conscience and the enjoyment of  popular liberty.    The war was continued for two years longer between Francis and  Charles, with great acrimony, but with various success, both parties  being, at one time, strengthened by alliances, and then again weakened  by desertions. At last, both parties were exhausted, and were willing  to accede to terms which they had previously rejected with disdain.  Francis was the most weakened and disheartened, but Charles was the  most perplexed. The troubles growing out of the Reformation demanded  his attention, and the Turks, at this period a powerful nation, were  about invading Austria. The Spaniards murmured at the unusual length  of the war, and money was with difficulty obtained.    Hence the peace of Cambray, August 5, 1529; which was very  advantageous to Charles, in consequence of the impulsive character of  Francis, and his impatience to recover his children, whom he had  surrendered to Charles in order to recover his liberty. He agreed to  pay two millions of crowns for the ransom of his sons, and renounce  his pretensions in the Low Countries and Italy. He, moreover, lost  reputation, and the confidence of Europe, by the abandonment of his  allies. Charles remained the arbiter of Italy, and was attentive to  the interests of all who adhered to him. With less _chivalry_ than his  rival, he had infinitely more _honor_. Cold, sagacious, selfish, and  ambitious, he was, however, just, and kept his word. He combined  qualities we often see in selfish men--a sort of legal and technical  regard to the letter of the law, with the constant violation of its  spirit. A Shylock might not enter a false charge upon his books, while  he would adhere to a most extortionate bargain.    Charles, after the treaty of Cambray was signed, visited Italy with  all the pomp of a conqueror. At Genoa, he honored Doria with many  marks of distinction, and bestowed upon the republic new privileges.  He settled all his difficulties with Milan, Venice, and Florence, and  reestablished the authority of the Medici. He was then crowned by the  pope, whom he had trampled on, as King of Lombardy and Emperor of the  Romans, and hastened into Germany, which imperatively required his  presence, both on account of dissensions among the princes, which the  reformation caused, and the invasion of Austria by three hundred  thousand Turks. He resolved to recover the old prerogatives of the  emperor of Germany, and crush those opinions which were undermining  his authority, as well as the power of Rome, with which his own was  identified.    [Sidenote: Diet of Spires.]    A Diet of the empire was accordingly summoned at Spires, in order to  take into consideration the state of religion, the main cause of all  the disturbances in Germany. It met on the 15th of March, 1529, and  the greatest address was required to prevent a civil war. All that  Charles could obtain from the assembled princes was, the promise to  prevent any further innovations. A decree to that effect was passed,  against which, however, the followers of Luther protested, the most  powerful of whom were the Elector of Saxony, the Marquis of  Brandenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Duke of Lunenburg, the Prince  of Anhalt, and the deputies of fourteen imperial cities. This protest  gave to them the name of _Protestants_--a name ever since retained.  Soon after, the diet assembled at Augsburg, when the articles of faith  among the Protestants were read,--known as the Confession of  Augsburg,--which, however, the emperor opposed. In consequence of his  decree, the Protestant princes entered into a league at Smalcalde,  (December 22, 1530,) to support one another, and defend their  religion. Circumstances continually occurred to convince Charles, that  the extirpation of heresy by the sword was impossible in Germany, and  moreover, he saw it was for his interest--to which his eye was  peculiarly open--to unite all the German provinces in a vigorous  confederation. Accordingly after many difficulties, and with great  reluctance, terms of pacification were agreed upon at Nuremburg,  (1531,) and ratified in the diet at Ratisbon, shortly after, by which  it was agreed that no person should be molested in his religion, and  that the Protestants, on their part, should assist the emperor in  resisting the invasion of the Turks. The Germans, with their customary  good faith, furnished all the assistance they promised, and one of the  best armies ever raised in Germany, amounting to ninety thousand foot,  and thirty thousand horse, took the field, commanded by the emperor in  person. But the campaign ended without any memorable event, both  parties having erred from excessive caution.    [Sidenote: Hostilities between Charles and Francis.]    Francis soon availed himself of the difficulties and dangers of his  rival, formed an alliance with the Turks, put forth his old claims,  courted the favor of the German Protestants, and renewed hostilities.  He marched towards Italy, and took possession of the dominions of the  duke of Savoy, whom the emperor, at this juncture, was unable to  assist, on account of his African expedition against the pirate  Barbarossa. This noted corsair had built up a great power in Tunis and  Algiers, and committed shameful ravages on all Christian nations.  Charles landed in Africa with thirty thousand men, took the fortress  of Goletta, defeated the pirate's army, captured his capital, and  restored the exiled Moorish king to his throne. In the midst of these  victories Francis invaded Savoy. Charles was terribly indignant, and  loaded his rival with such violent invectives that Francis challenged  him to single combat. The challenge was accepted, but the duel was  never fought. Charles, in his turn, invaded France, with a large army,  for that age--forty thousand foot and ten thousand horse; but the  expedition was unfortunate. Francis acted on the defensive with  admirable skill, and was fortunate in his general Montmorency, who  seemed possessed with the spirit of a Fabius. The emperor, at last,  was compelled to return ingloriously, having lost half of his army  without having gained a single important advantage. The joy of  Francis, however, was embittered by the death of the dauphin,  attributed by some to the infamous Catharine de Medicis, wife of the  Duke of Orleans, in order to secure the crown to her husband. War did  not end with the retreat of Charles, but was continued, with great  personal animosity, until mutual exhaustion led to a truce for ten  years, concluded at Nice, in 1538. Both parties had exerted their  utmost strength, and neither had obtained any signal advantage.  Notwithstanding their open and secret enmity, they had an interview  shortly after the truce, in which both vied with each other in  expressions of esteem and friendship, and in the exhibition of  chivalrous courtesies--a miserable mockery, as shown by the violation  of the terms of the truce, and the renewal of hostilities in 1541.    [Sidenote: African Wars.]    These were, doubtless, facilitated by Charles's unfortunate expedition  against Algiers in 1541, by which he gained nothing but disgrace. His  army was wasted by famine and disease, and a tempest destroyed his  fleet. All the complicated miseries which war produces were endured by  his unfortunate troops, but a small portion of whom ever returned.  Francis, taking advantage of these misfortunes, made immense military  preparations, formed a league with the Sultan Solyman, and brought  five armies into the field. He assumed the offensive, and invaded the  Netherlands, but obtained no laurels. Charles formed a league with  Henry VIII., and the war raged, with various success, without either  party obtaining any signal advantage, for three years, when a peace  was concluded at Crespy, in 1544. Charles, being in the heart of  France with an invading army, had the apparent advantage but the  difficulty of retreating out of France in case of disaster, and the  troubles in Germany, forced him to suspend his military operations.  The pope, also, was offended because he had conceded so much to the  Protestants, and the Turks pressed him on the side of Hungary.  Moreover, he was afflicted with the gout, which indisposed him for  complicated enterprises. In view of these things, he made peace with  Francis, formed a strong alliance with the pope, and resolved to  extirpate the Protestant religion, which was the cause of so many  insurrections in Germany.    [Sidenote: Council of Trent.]    In the mean time, the pope resolved to assemble the famous Council of  Trent, the legality of which the Protestants denied. It met in  December, 1545, and was the last general council which the popes ever  assembled. It met with a view of healing the dissensions of the  church, and confirming the authority of the pope. The princes of  Europe hoped that important reforms would have been made; but nothing  of consequence was done, and the attention of the divines was directed  to dogmas rather than morals. The great number of Italian bishops  enabled the pope to have every thing his own way, in spite of the  remonstrance of the German, Spanish, and French prelates, and the  ambassadors of the different monarchs, who also had seats in the  council. The decrees of this council, respecting articles of faith,  are considered as a final authority by the Roman church. It denounced  the reform of Luther, and confirmed the various ecclesiastical  usurpations"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#11)"],[1,"is rewarded with that which seems valuable  it turns out worthless. An Irishwoman, in relating a professional  experience among the Good People, wound up her story as follows: \"The  king slipped five guineas into my hand as soon as I was on the ground,  and thanked me, and bade me good-night. I hope I'll never see his face  again. I got into bed, and couldn't sleep for a long time; and when I  examined my five guineas this morning, that I left in the table-drawer  the last thing, I found five withered leaves of oak--bad scran to the  giver!\" This incident recalls the Barber's tale of his fourth brother in  the \"Arabian Nights.\" This unlucky man went on selling meat to a  sorcerer for five months, and putting the bright new money in which the  latter paid him into a box by itself; but when he came to open the box  he found in it nothing but a parcel of leaves, or, as Sir Richard Burton  has it, bits of white paper cut round to look like coin. Chinese  folklore is full of similar occurrences, which we cannot now stay to  discuss. But, returning to western traditions, there is a way of  counteracting the elves' transforming magic. The wife of a farmer named  Niels Hansen, of Uglerup, in Denmark, was summoned to attend a  troll-wife, who told her that the troll, her husband, would offer her a  quantity of gold; \"but,\" she said, \"unless you cast this knife behind  you when you go out, it will be nothing but coal when you reach home\".  The woman followed her patient's advice, and so continued to carry  safely home a costly present of gold.[26]    The objection of supernatural beings to iron, and its power of undoing  their charms, will be considered in a future chapter. The good luck of  Niels Hansen's wife offers meantime another subject of interest; for it  was due to her own kindness of heart. A short time before she had been  raking hay in a field, when she caught a large and fat toad between the  teeth of her rake. She gently released it, saying: \"Poor thing! I see  that thou needest help; I will help thee.\" That toad was the troll-wife,  and as she afterwards attended her she was horrified to see a hideous  serpent hanging down just above her head. Her fright led to explanations  and an expression of gratitude on the part of the troll-wife. This  incident is by no means uncommon; but a very few examples must suffice  here. Generally the woman's terror is attributed to a millstone hanging  over her head. At Grammendorf, in Pomerania, a maid saw, every time she  went to milk the cows, a hateful toad hopping about in the stable. She  determined to kill it, and would have seized it one day had it not, in  the very nick of time, succeeded in creeping into a hole, where she  could not get at it. A few days after, when she was again busy in the  stable, a little Ulk, as the elves there are called, came and invited  her to descend with him into Fairyland. On reaching the bottom of a  staircase with her conductor, she found her services were required for  an Ulkwife, whose time was at hand. Entering the dwelling she was  frightened to observe a huge millstone above her, suspended by a silken  thread; and the Ulk, seeing her terror, told her she had caused him  exactly the same, when she chased the poor toad and attempted to kill  it. The girl was compelled to share in the feast which followed. When it  was over she was given a piece of gold, that she was carefully to  preserve; for so long as she did so she would never be in want of money.  But her guide warned her at parting never to relate her experience,  otherwise the elves would fetch her again, and set her under the  millstone, which would then fall and crush her. Whether this was indeed  the consequence of her narrating this very true story we do not know.  After some of the beliefs we have been considering in the foregoing  pages it is, however, interesting to note that no ill attended her  eating and drinking in Fairyland, and that the gold she received did not  turn to dross, though it possessed other miraculous qualities which  might very well have led her to the bad end threatened by the Ulk.  Perhaps a portion of the story has been lost.[27]    Sometimes a different turn is given to the tale. A Swabian peasant-woman  was once in the fields with her servant-maid, when they saw a big toad.  The woman told her maid to kill it. The latter replied: \"No; I won't do  that, and I will stand sponsor for it yet once more.\" Not long  afterwards she was sent for to become sponsor, and was conducted into  the lake, where she found the toad now in guise of a woman. After the  ceremony was over, the lake-woman rewarded her with a bushel of straw,  and sent by her hand a girdle for her mistress. On the way home the girl  tried the girdle on a tree to see how it would look, and in a moment the  tree was torn into a thousand pieces. This was the punishment devised by  the lake-woman for her mistress, because she had wished to put her to  death while in the form of a toad. The straw was, of course, pure gold;  but the girl foolishly cast it all away except a few stalks which clung  to her dress. So a countryman who accidentally spilt some hot broth on a  witch, disguised as a toad, is presented by her another day with a  girdle for his little son. Suspecting something wrong, he tries it on  his dog, which at once swells up and bursts. This is a Saxon saga from  Transylvania; an Irish saga brings us to the same catastrophe. There a  girl meets a frog which is painfully bloated, and kicks it unfeelingly  aside, with the words: \"May you never be delivered till I am midwife to  you!\" Now the frog was a water-fairy dwelling in a lake, into which the  girl soon after was conveyed and compelled to become the fairy's  midwife. By way of reward she is presented with a red cloak, which, on  her way home, she hangs up in admiration on a tree. Well was it for her  that she did so, for it set the tree on fire; and had she worn it, as  she meant to do, on the following Sunday at Mass, the chapel itself  would have been in a blaze.[28]    The fairies' revenge here missed its mark, though calculated on no  trifling scale. Indeed, the rewards they bestowed were never nicely  balanced with the good or ill they intended to requite, but were  showered in open-handed fashion as by those who could afford to be  lavish. Of this we have already had several instances; a few more may be  given. At Palermo a tale is told of a midwife who was one day cooking in  her own kitchen when a hand appeared and a voice cried: \"Give to me!\"  She took a plate and filled it from the food she was preparing.  Presently the hand returned the plate full of golden money. This was  repeated daily; and the woman, seeing the generous payment, became more  and more free with her portions of food. At the end of nine months a  knocking was heard at the door; and, descending, she found two giants,  who caught her up on their shoulders, and unceremoniously ran off with  her. They carried her to a lady who needed her offices, and she assisted  to bring into the world two fine boys. The lady evidently was fully  alive to her own dignity, for she kept the woman a proper human month,  to the distress of her husband, who, not knowing what had become of her,  searched the city night and day, and at last gave her up for dead. Then  the lady (a fairy princess she was) asked her if she wished to go, and  whether she would be paid by blows or pinches. The poor midwife deemed  her last hour was come, and said to herself that if she must die it  would be better to die quickly; so she chose blows. Accordingly the  princess called the two giants, and sent her home with a large sack of  money, which enabled her to relinquish business, set up her carriage,  and become one of the first ladies in Palermo. Ten years passed; and one  day a grand carriage stopped at her door. A lady alighted and entered  her palace. When she had her face to face, the lady said: \"Gossip, do  you know me?\" \"No, madam.\" \"What! do you not remember that I am the lady  to whom you came ten years ago, when these children were born? I, too,  am she who held out her hand and asked for food. I was the fairies'  captive; and if you had not been generous enough to give me to eat, I  should have died in the night. And because you were generous you have  become rich. Now I am freed, and here I am with my sons.\" The quondam  midwife, with tears in her eyes, looked at her, and blessed the moment  she had done a generous act. So they became lifelong friends.[29]    I have given the foregoing tale almost at full length because it has  not, so far as I know, appeared before in any other than its native  Sicilian dress, and because analogous stories are not common in  collections from Mediterranean countries. This rarity is not, I need  hardly say, from any absence of the mythological material, and perhaps  it may be due to accident in the formation of the collections. If the  story were really wanting elsewhere in Southern Europe, we might be  permitted the conjecture that its presence in Sicily was to be accounted  for by the Norman settlements there. One such story, however, is  recorded from the Island of Kimolos, one of the Cyclades, but without  the human captivity in Elfland, without the acts of charity, and without  the gratitude. The Nereids of the Kimoliote caves are of a grimmer  humour than the kindly-natured underground folk of Celtic and Teutonic  lands, or than the heroine of Palermo. The payment to their human help  is no subject of jest to them. A woman whom they once called in was  roundly told: \"If it be a boy you shall be happy; but if it be a girl we  will tear you in four parts, and hang you in this cave.\" The unhappy  midwife of course determined that it should be a boy; and when a girl  arrived she made believe it was a boy, swaddled it up tightly, and went  home. When, eight days afterwards, the child was unpacked, the Nereids'  rage and disappointment"]]]
