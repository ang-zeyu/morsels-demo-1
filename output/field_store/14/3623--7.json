Comparatively few data are available showing the tractive resistance  of motor vehicles, but the following tables are based on sufficient  data to serve to illustrate the general trend.    These data on the tractive resistances of an electric truck with solid  rubber tires on asphalt and bitulithic, wood, brick and granite block,  water-bonded and tar macadam, cinder and gravel road surfaces were  obtained by A. E. Kennelly and O. R. Schurig in the research division  of the electrical engineering department of the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, and are published in Bulletin No. 10 of the  division.    An electric truck was run over measured sections, ranging from 400 to  2600 feet in length, surfaced with these various materials, at certain  speeds per hour, ranging from about 8 to about 15.5 miles per hour.  The result of the observations of speeds, tractive resistances,  conditions of surfaces, etc., were collected and studied in various  combinations.

In Fig. 8 _W_ represents the  weight of the vehicle, acting vertically downward, _w_ is the  component of the weight perpendicular to the road surface and _W_{2}_  is the component parallel to the road surface.        _W_{2}_     = _W_ tan _THETA_.        tan _THETA_ = 0.01 x per cent of grade.        _W_{2}_     = 0.01 _W_ x per cent grade.        _W_{2}_     = 0.01 x 2000 x per cent of grade, for each ton                        of weight of vehicle.      Hence _W_{2}_ = 20 lbs. per ton of load for each one per cent of                        grade.    The gravity force acting upon a vehicle parallel to the surface on a  grade is therefore 20 lbs. per ton for each one per cent of grade and  this force tends either to retard or to accelerate the movement of the  vehicle.    Let _F_ = the sum of all forces opposing the translation of a vehicle.      _F = f_{r} + f_{i} + f_{p} + f_{a} + f_{g}_     (1)    where      _f_{r}_ = rolling resistance of road surface.    _f_{i}_ = resistance due to internal friction in the vehicle.    _f_{p}_ = resistance due to impact of the road surface.    _f_{a}_ = resistance due to air.    _f_{g}_ = resistance due to grade, which is positive when        ascending and negative when descending.    All of the above in pounds per ton of 2000 lbs.    Let _T_ = the tractive effort applied to the vehicle by any means.    _T_ >= must be greater than _F_ in order to move the vehicle.    By an inspection of (1), it will be seen that for a given vehicle and  any type of road surface, all terms are constant except _f_{a}_ and  _f_{g}_. _f_{a}_ varies as the speed of the vehicle and the driver can  materially decrease _f_{a}_ by reducing speed. _f_{g}_ varies with the  rate of grade. For any vehicle loaded for satisfactory operation on a  level road with the power available, the limiting condition is the  factor _f_{g}_. If the load is such as barely to permit motion on a  level road, any hill will stall the vehicle. Therefore, in practice  the load is always so adjusted that there is an excess of power on a  level road. If draft animals are employed the load is usually about  one fourth of that which the animals could actually move by their  maximum effort for a short period. With motor vehicles, the excess  power is provided for by gearing.    If it be assured a load of convenient size is being moved on a level  road by draft animals, there is a limit to the rate of grade up which  the load can be drawn by the maximum effort of the animals.    Tests indicate that the horse can pull at a speed of 2-1/2 miles per  hour, an amount equal to 1/8 to 1/10 of its weight, and for short  intervals can pull 3/4 of its weight. The maximum effort possible is  therefore six times the average pull, but this is possible for only  short intervals. A very short steep hill would afford a condition  where such effort would be utilized. But for hills of any length, that  is, one hundred feet or more but not to exceed five hundred feet, it  is safe to count on the draft animal pulling three times his normal  pulling power for sustained effort.    The limiting grade for the horse drawn vehicle is therefore one  requiring, to overcome the effect of grade, or _f_{g}_, a pull in  excess of three times that exerted on the level.    A team of draft animals weighing 1800 lbs. each could exert a  continuous pull of about 1/10 of their weight or 360 lbs. If it be  assumed that the character of the vehicle and the road surface is such  that _f_{r}_ + _f_{i}_ + _f_{p}_ + _f_{a}_ = 100 lbs. per gross ton on  a level section of road, then the gross load for the team would be 3.6  tons. The same team could for a short time exert an additional pull of  three times 360 lbs. or 1080 lbs. For each 1 per cent of grade a pull  of 20 lbs. per ton would be required or _f_{g}_ for the 3.6 tons load  would be 72 lbs. for each per cent of grade. At that rate, the  limiting grade for the team would be fifteen per cent.    If, however, the character of the vehicle and the road surface were  such that _f_{r}_ + _f_{i}_ + _f_{p}_ + _f_{a}_ = 60 lbs. per gross  ton on a level section of road, the gross load for the team on the  level would be 6 tons, and the limiting grade 9 per cent.    The above discussion serves to illustrate the desirability of adopting  a low ruling or limiting grade for roads to be surfaced with a  material having low tractive resistance and the poor economy of  adopting a low ruling grade for earth roads or roads to be surfaced  with material of high tractive resistance.    It may be questioned whether horse drawn traffic should be the  limiting consideration for main trunk line highways, but it is  certain that for a number of years horse drawn traffic will be a  factor on secondary roads.    In the case of motor vehicles, excess power is provided by means of  gears and no difficulty is encountered in moving vehicles over grades  up to 12 or 15 per cent, so that any grade that would ordinarily be  tolerated on a main highway will present no obstacle to motor  vehicles, but the economy of such design is yet to be investigated.    =Energy Loss on Account of Grades.=--Whether a vehicle is horse drawn  or motor driven, energy has been expended in moving it up a hill. A  part of this energy "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29444"],[0,"The Machinery of the Universe: Mechanical Conceptions of Physical Phenomena (#11)"],[1,"field.  Suppose the hand magnet to have its direction completely reversed once  in a second. The whole field, and the direction of the stress, would  necessarily be reversed as often. But this kind of change in stress is  known by experiment to travel with the speed of light, 186,000 miles a  second; the disturbance due to the change of position of the magnet will  therefore be felt in some degree throughout space. In a second and a  third of a second it will have reached the moon, and a magnet there will  be in some measure affected by it. If there were an observer there with  a delicate-enough magnet, he could be witness to its changes once a  second for the same reason one in the room could. The only difference  would be one of amount of swing. It is therefore theoretically possible  to signal to the moon with a swinging magnet. Suppose again that the  magnet should be swung twice a second, there would be formed two waves,  each one half as long as the first. If it should swing ten times a  second, then the waves would be one-tenth of 186,000 miles long. If in  some mechanical way it could be rotated 186,000 times a second, the wave  would be but one mile long. Artificial ways have been invented for  changing this magnet field as many as 100 million times a second, and  the corresponding wave is less than a foot long. The shape of a magnet  does not necessarily make it weaker or stronger as a magnet, but if the  poles are near together the magnetic field is denser between them than  when they are separated. The ether stress is differently distributed for  every change in the relative positions of the poles.    A common U-magnet, if struck, will vibrate like a tuning-fork, and gives  out a definite pitch. Its poles swing towards and away from each other  at uniform rates, and the pitch of the magnet will depend upon its size,  thickness, and the material it is made of.    Let ten or fifteen ohms of any convenient-sized wire be wound upon the  bend of a commercial U-magnet. Let this wire be connected to a telephone  in its circuit. When the magnet is made to sound like a tuning-fork, the  pitch will be reproduced in the telephone very loudly. If another magnet  with a different pitch be allowed to vibrate near the former, the pitch  of the vibrating body will be heard in the telephone, and these show  that the changing magnetic field reacts upon the quiescent magnet, and  compels the latter to vibrate at the same rate. The action is an ether  action, the waves are ether waves, but they are relatively very long. If  the magnet makes 500 vibrations a second, the waves will be 372 miles  long, the number of times 500 is contained in 186,000 miles. Imagine the  magnet to become smaller and smaller until it was the size of an atom,  the one-fifty-millionth of an inch. Its vibratory rate would be  proportionally increased, and changes in its form will still bring about  changes in its magnetic field. But its magnetic field is practically  limitless, and the number of vibrations per second is to be reckoned  as millions of millions; the waves are correspondingly short,  small fractions of an inch. When they are as short as the  one-thirty-seven-thousandth of an inch, they are capable of affecting  the retina of the eye, and then are said to be visible as red light. If  the vibratory rate be still higher, and the corresponding waves be no  more than one-sixty-thousandth of an inch long, they affect the retina  as violet light, and between these limits there are all the waves that  produce a complete spectrum. The atoms, then, shake the ether in this  way because they all have a magnetic hold upon the ether, so that any  disturbance of their own magnetism, such as necessarily comes when they  collide, reacts upon the ether for the same reason that a large magnet  acts thus upon it when its poles approach and recede from each other. It  is not a phenomenon of mechanical impact or frictional resistance, since  neither are possible in the ether.      19. MATTER EXISTS IN SEVERAL STATES.    Molecular cohesion exists between very wide ranges. When strong, so if  one part of a body is moved the whole is moved in the same way, without  breaking continuity or the relative positions of the molecules, we call  the body a solid. In a liquid, cohesion is greatly reduced, and any part  of it may be deformed without materially changing the form of the rest.  The molecules are free to move about each other, and there is no  definite position which any need assume or keep. With gases, the  molecules are without any cohesion, each one is independent of every  other one, collides with and bounds away from others as free elastic  particles do. Between impacts it moves in what is called its free path,  which may be long or short as the density of the gas be less or greater.    These differing degrees of cohesion depend upon temperature, for if the  densest and hardest substances are sufficiently heated they will become  gaseous. This is only another way of saying that the states of matter  depend upon the amount of molecular energy present. Solid ice becomes  water by the application of heat. More heat reduces it to steam; still  more decomposes the steam molecules into oxygen and hydrogen molecules;  and lastly, still more heat will decompose these molecules into their  atomic state, complete dissociation. On cooling, the process of  reduction will be reversed until ice has been formed again.    Cohesive strength in solids is increased by reduction of temperature,  and metallic rods become stronger the colder they are.    No distinction is now made between cohesion and chemical affinity, and  yet at low temperatures chemical action will not take place, which  phenomenon shows there is a distinction between molecular cohesion and  molecular structure. In molecular structure, as determined by chemical  activity, the molecules and atoms are arranged in definite ways which  depend upon the rate of vibrations of the components. The atoms are set  in definite positions to constitute a given molecule. But atoms or  molecules may cohere for other reasons, gravitative or magnetic, and  relative positions would be immaterial. In the absence of temperature, a  solid body would be solider and stronger than ever, while a gaseous mass  would probably fall by gravity to the floor of the containing vessel  like so much dust. The molecular structure might not be changed, for  there would be no agency to act upon it in a disturbing way.      THE ETHER HAS NO CORRESPONDING STATES.    Degrees of density have already been excluded, and the homogeneity and  continuity of the ether would also exclude the possibility of different  states at all comparable with such as belong to matter. As for cohesion,  it is doubtful if the term ought to be applied to such a substance. The  word itself seems to imply possible separateness, and if the ether be a  single indivisible substance, its cohesion must be infinite and is  therefore not a matter of degree. The ether has sometimes been  considered as an elastic solid, but such solidity is comparable with  nothing we call solid in matter, and the word has to be defined in a  special sense in order that its use may be tolerated at all. In addition  to this, some of the phenomena exhibited by it, such as diffraction and  double refraction, are quite incompatible with the theory that the ether  is an elastic solid. The reasons why it cannot be considered as a liquid  or gas have been considered previously.    The expression _states of matter_ cannot be applied to the ether in any  such sense as it is applied to matter, but there is one sense when  possibly it may be considered applicable. Let it be granted that an atom  is a vortex-ring of ether in the ether, then the state of being in ring  rotation would suffice to differentiate that part of the ether from the  rest, and give to it a degree of individuality not possessed by the  rest; and such an atom might be called a state of ether. In like manner,  if other forms of motion, such as transverse waves, circular and  elliptical spirals, or others, exist in the ether, then such movements  give special character to the part thus active, and it would be proper  to speak of such states of the ether, but even thus the word would not  be used in the same sense as it is used when one speaks of the states of  matter as being solid, liquid, and gaseous.      20. SOLID MATTER CAN EXPERIENCE A SHEARING STRESS, LIQUIDS AND GASES  CANNOT.    A sliding stress applied to a solid deforms it to a degree which depends  upon the stress and the degree of rigidity preserved by the body. Thus  if the hand be placed upon a closed book lying on the table, and  pressure be so applied as to move the upper side of the book but not the  lower, the book is said to be subject to a shearing stress. If the  pressing hand has a twisting motion, the book will be warped. Any solid  may be thus sheared or warped, but neither liquids nor gases can be so  affected. Molecular cohesion makes it possible in the one, and the lack  of it, impossible in the others. The solid can maintain such a  deformation indefinitely long, if the pressure does not rupture its  molecular structure.      THE ETHER CAN MAINTAIN A SHEARING STRESS.    The phenomena in a magnetic field show that the stress is of such a sort  as to twist into a new directional position the body upon which it acts  as exhibited by a magnetic needle, also as indicated by the transverse  vibrations of the ether waves, and again by the twist given to plane  polarized light when moving through a magnetic field. These are all  interpreted as indicative of the direction of ether stress, as being  similar to a shearing stress in solid matter. The fact has been adduced  to show the ether to be a solid, but such a phenomenon is certainly  incompatible with a liquid or gaseous ether. This kind of stress is  maintained indefinitely about a permanent magnet,"]]]
