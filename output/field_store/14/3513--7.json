He had the  reputation of being a just and kind ruler of his people, but very  cruel in war. Carpini and Stephen were placed on the left of the  throne, and the papal letters, translated into a language composed  of Tartar and Arabic, were presented to the prince. He read them  attentively and then dismissed the envoys to their tents, where  their only refreshment was a little porringer full of millet.    This interview took place on Good Friday, and the next day Bathy  sent for the envoys, and told them they must go to the Emperor. They  set out on Easter-day with two guides; but having lived upon nothing  but millet, water, and salt, the travellers were but little fit for  a journey; nevertheless their guides obliged them to travel very  quickly, changing horses five or six times in a day. They passed  through almost a desert country, the Tartars having driven away  nearly all the inhabitants. They came next to the country of the  Kangites to the east of Comania, where there was a great deficiency  of water; in this province the people were mostly herdsmen, under  the hard yoke of the Mongolians.    Carpini was travelling from Easter till Ascension-Day through the  land of the Kangites, and thence he came into the Biserium country,  or what we call Turkestan in the present day; on all sides the eye  rested on towns and villages in ruins. After crossing a chain of  mountains the envoys entered Kara-Katy on the 1st of July; here the  governor received them very hospitably, and made his sons and the  principal officers of his court dance before them for their  amusement.    On leaving Kara-Katy the envoys rode for some days along the banks  of a lake lying to the north of the town of Zeman, which must be,  according to M. de Remusat, the Lake Balkash. There lived Ordu, the  eldest of the Tartar captains, and here Carpini and Stephen took a  day's rest before encountering the cold and mountainous country of  the Maimans, a nomadic people living in tents. After some days the  travellers reached the country of the Mongols, and on the 22nd of  July arrived at the place where the Emperor was, or rather he who  was to be Emperor, the election having not yet taken place.    This future Emperor was named Cunius; he received the envoys in a  most friendly manner, a letter from Prince Bathy having explained to  him the object of their visit; not being yet Emperor he could not  entertain them nor take any part in public affairs, but from the  time of Ojadai's death, his widow, the mother of Prince Cunius had  been Regent; she received the travellers in a purple and white tent  capable of holding 2000 persons. Carpini gives the following account  of the interview: \"When we arrived we saw a large assembly of dukes  and princes who had come from all parts with their attendants, who  were on horseback in the neighbouring fields and on the hills. The  first day they were all dressed in white and purple, on the second  when Cunius appeared in the tent, in red, on the third day they wore  violet, and on the fourth, scarlet, or crimson. Outside the tent, in  the surrounding palisade were two great gates, by one of which the  Emperor alone might enter; it was unguarded, but none dared to enter  or leave by it; while the other, which was the general entrance, was  guarded by soldiers with swords, and bows and arrows; if any one  approached within the prescribed limits he was beaten, or else shot  to death with arrows. We noticed several horsemen there, on whose  harness cannot have been less than twenty marks' worth of silver.\"    [Illustration: The Tartars.]    A whole month passed away before Cunius was proclaimed Emperor, and  the envoys were obliged to wait patiently for this before they could  be received by him. Carpini turned this leisure time to account by  studying the habits of the people; he has given much interesting  information on the subject in his account of his travels.    The country seemed to him to be principally very hilly and the soil  sandy, with but little vegetation. There is scarce any wood; but all  classes are content with dung for fuel. Though the country is so  bare, sheep seem to do well. The climate is very changeable; in  summer, storms are very frequent, many fall victims to the vivid  lightning, and the wind is often so strong as even to blow over men  on horseback: during the winter there is no rain, which all falls in  the summer, and then scarcely enough to lay the dust, while the  storms of hail are terrible; during Carpini's residence in the  country they were so severe that once 140 persons were drowned by  the melting of the enormous mass of hail-stones that had fallen. It  is a very extensive country, but miserable beyond expression.    Carpini who seems to have been a man of great discernment took a  very just idea of the Tartars themselves. He says, \"Their eyes are  set very far apart; they have very high cheek-bones, their noses are  small and flat; their eyes small, and their eye-lashes and eyebrows  seem to meet; they are of middle height with slender waists, they  have small beards, some wear moustaches, and what are now called  imperials. On the top of the head the hair is shaved off like monks,  and to the width of three fingers between their ears they also shave  off the hair, letting what is between the tonsure and the back of  the head grow to some length; in fact it is as long as a woman's in  many cases, and plaited and tied in two tails behind the ear. They  have small feet. He says there is but little difference perceptible  in the dress of the men and women, all alike wearing long robes  trimmed with fur, and high buckram caps enlarged towards the upper  part. Their houses are built like tents of rods and stakes, so that  they can be easily taken down and packed on the beasts of burden.  Other larger dwellings are sometimes carried whole as they stand, on  carts, and thus follow their owner about the country.    \"The Tartars believe in God as the Creator of the universe and as  the Rewarder and Avenger of all, but they also worship the sun, moon,  fire, earth, and water, and idols made in felt, like human beings.  They have little toleration, and put Michael of Turnigoo and Feodor  to death for not worshipping the sun at midday at the command of  Prince Bathy. They are a superstitious people, believing in  enchantment and sorcery, and looking upon fire as the purifier of  all things. When one of their chiefs dies he is buried with a horse  saddled and bridled, a table, a dish of meat, a cup of mare's milk,  and a mare and foal.    \"The Tartars are most obedient to their chiefs, and are truthful and  not quarrelsome; murders and deeds of violence are rare, there is  very little robbery, and articles of value are never guarded. They  bear great fatigue and hunger without complaint, as well as heat and  cold, singing and dancing under the most adverse circumstances. They  are much prone to drink to excess; they are very proud and  disdainful to strangers, and have no respect for the lives of human  beings.\"    Carpini completes his sketch of the Tartar character by adding that  they eat all kinds of animals, dogs, wolves, foxes, horses, and even  sometimes their fellow-creatures. Their principal beverage is the  milk of the mare, sheep, goat, cow, and camel. They have neither  wine, cervisia, (a beverage composed of grain and herbs,) nor mead,  but only intoxicating liquors. They are very dirty in their habits,  scarcely ever washing their porringers, or only doing so in their  broth; they hardly ever wash their clothes, more especially \"when  there is thunder about;\" and they eat rats, mice, &c., if they are  badly off for other food. The men are not brought up to any manual  labour, their whole occupation consisting in hunting, shooting with  bow and arrows, watching the flocks, and riding. The women and girls  are very athletic and very brave, they prepare furs and make clothes,  drive carts and camels, and as polygamy is practised among them, and  a man _buys_ as many wives as he can keep, there are enough women  for all these employments.    Such is the resume of Carpini's observations made during his  residence at Syra-Orda while he was awaiting the Emperor's election.  Soon he found that the election was about to take place; he noticed  that the courtiers always sang before Cunius when he came out of his  tent, and bowed down before him with beautiful little wands in their  hands, having small pieces of scarlet wool attached to them. On a  plain about four leagues from Syra-Orda, beside a stream, a tent was  prepared for the Coronation, carpeted with scarlet, and supported on  columns covered with gold. On St. Bartholomew's day a large  concourse of people assembled, each one fell on his knees as he  arrived, and remained praying towards the sun; but Carpini and his  companion refused to join in this idolatrous worship of the sun.  Then Cunius was placed on the imperial throne, and the dukes and all  the assembled multitudes having done homage to him, he was  consecrated.    As soon as this ceremony was over, Carpini and Stephen were  commanded to appear before the Emperor. They were first searched and  then entered the imperial presence at the same time as other  Ambassadors, the bearers of rich presents; the poor papal envoys had  nothing to present; whether this had anything to do with the length  of time they had to wait before his Imperial Majesty could attend to  their affairs we do not know; but days passed slowly by, and they  were nearly dying of hunger and thirst, before they received a  summons to appear before the Secretary of the Emperor, and letters  to the Pope were given to them, ending with these words, \"we worship  GOD, and by His help we shall destroy the whole earth from east to  west.\"    The envoys had now nothing to wait for, and during the whole of the  winter they travelled across icy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#11)"],[1,"affiliate them to a new Irish university.]        [Footnote 12: As Macaulay had said during the previous night's      debate: \"The Orangeman raises his war whoop, Exeter Hall sets      up its bray, Mr Macneile shudders to see more costly cheer      than ever provided for the priests of Baal at the table of      the Queen, and the Protestant operatives of Dublin call for      impeachments in exceedingly bad English.\"]          _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    BUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd April 1845._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Our Maynooth Bill is through the second reading. I  think, if you read Sir Robert's admirable speeches, you will see how  good his plan is. The _Catholics_ are quite delighted at it--full  of gratitude, and behave extremely well; but the Protestants behave  shockingly, and display a narrow-mindedness and want of sense on the  subject of religion which is quite a disgrace to the nation. The case  of Austria, France, etc., cannot be compared to this, as _this_ is a  _Protestant_ country, while the others are Catholic; and I think it  would never do to support a Roman Catholic Church with money belonging  to the Protestant Church. The Protestant Establishment in Ireland  must remain untouched, but let the Roman Catholic Clergy be well and  handsomely educated.    The Duc de Broglie[13] dined with us last night; his _travaux_ are  going on satisfactorily; he asked when you were coming, and said you  were \"_beaucoup Anglais et un peu Francais_,\" which is true, I think.    With Albert's affectionate respects, believe me always, your devoted  Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 13: Achille Charles, Duc de Broglie, ex-Minister of      Foreign Affairs.]          _Mr Goulburn[14] to Queen Victoria._    DOWNING STREET, _30th April 1845._    Mr Goulburn submits with his humble duty to your Majesty that several  representations have been made to the Treasury as to the convenience  which the public would derive from the circulation of silver  threepenny-pieces. Such pieces are lawfully current under your  Majesty's Proclamation of the 5th July 1838. But as such pieces have  been hitherto reserved as your Majesty's Maundy money, and as such  especially belong to your Majesty's service, Mr Goulburn considers  that a coinage of them for general use could not take place without a  particular signification of your Majesty's pleasure.    Mr Goulburn therefore humbly submits for your Majesty's gracious  consideration the signification of your Majesty's pleasure as to the  issue of such a coinage.        [Footnote 14: Chancellor of the Exchequer.]          [Pageheading: PUBLIC EXECUTIONS]      _Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _13th May 1845._    Sir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to lay before your Majesty  the enclosed Memorial.    The proceedings in Newgate on the occasion of the last condemned  sermon and on the morning of the execution have been fully  investigated;[15] and the report established the necessity of  legislative interference to prevent the recurrence of scenes so  disgraceful and demoralising. The policy of depriving capital  executions of their present publicity is well worthy of careful  revision; and Sir James Graham, in obedience to your Majesty's desire,  will bring the subject under the notice of his colleagues. He is  disposed to think that the sentence might be carried into execution in  the presence of a Jury to be summoned by the Sheriff with good effect;  and that the great body of idle spectators might be excluded, without  diminishing the salutary terror and awful warning which this extreme  punishment is intended to produce on the public mind. In dealing,  however, with a matter in which the community has so deep an interest,  it is prudent not to violate public opinion, and caution is necessary  before a change of the long-established usage is proposed.[16]    Sir James Graham deeply regrets the part taken by the newspapers in  seeking to indulge the general curiosity with respect to all details  of the conduct, habits, and demeanour of these wretched criminals in  their last moments; but he fears that the license of the Press cannot  be checked by any act of authority; if the public be excluded from  witnessing the executions, they will probably become still more  anxious to obtain a printed report of all that has taken place; and  Sir James Graham is so thoroughly convinced that the punishment of  death in certain cases must be maintained, that he would consider any  course inexpedient which was likely to lead the public to desire the  remission of capital executions in all cases without exception....    J. R. G. GRAHAM.        [Footnote 15: The attraction these executions had for the      general public was at this time a great scandal.]        [Footnote 16: Public executions were abolished in 1868.]          [Pageheading: A BIRTHDAY LETTER]    [Pageheading: THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE]      _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    LAEKEN, _21st May 1845._    MY DEAREST AND MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--Receive my sincerest and most  heartfelt good wishes on the happy reappearance of your birthday. I  need not dwell on my sentiments of devotion to you; they began with  _your life, and will only end with mine_. The only claim I make is to  be remembered with some little affection. Thank heaven, I have little  to wish you, than that your present happiness may not be disturbed,  and that those who are dear to you may be preserved for your  happiness.    My gift is Charlotte's portrait. The face is extremely like, and the  likest that exists; the hair is a little too fair, it had become  also darker. I take this opportunity to repeat that Charlotte was a  noble-minded and highly gifted creature. She was nervous, as all  the family have been; she could be violent, but then she was full  of repentance for it, and her disposition _highly generous_ and  _susceptible_ of _great devotion_.    I am the more bound to say this, as I understood that you had some  notion that she had been _very imperious_, and not mistress of her  temper. Before her marriage some people by dint of flattery had tried  to give her masculine tastes; and in short had pushed her to become  one day a sort of Queen Elizabeth. These sentiments were already  a little modified before her marriage. But she was particularly  determined to be a _good_ and _obedient_ wife; some of her friends  were anxious she should _not_; amongst these Madame de Flahaut must be  mentioned _en premiere ligne_.    This became even a subject which severed the intimacy between them.  Madame de Flahaut, much older than Charlotte, and of a sour and  determined character, had gained an influence which partook on  Charlotte's part a little of fear. She was afraid of her, but when  once supported took courage.    People were much struck on the 2nd of May 1816 at Carlton House with  the clearness and firmness with which she pronounced \"_and obey_,\"  etc., as there had been a _general belief_ that it would be _for the  husband_ to give _these promises_. The Regent put me particularly on  my guard, and said, \"If you don't resist she will govern you with a  high hand.\" Your own experience has convinced you that real affection  changes many sentiments that may have been implanted into the mind of  a young girl. With Charlotte it was the more meritorious, as from a  very early period of her life she was considered as the heiress of the  Crown; the Whigs flattered her extremely, and later, when she got by  my intervention reconciled to the Tories, they also made great efforts  to please her.    Her understanding was extremely good; she knew everybody, and I even  afterwards found her judgment generally extremely correct. _She had  read a great deal and knew well what she had read._ Generous she was  almost _too much_, and her _devotion_ was quite affecting, from a  character so much pushed to be selfish and imperious.    I will here end my souvenir of poor dear Charlotte, but I thought  that the subject could not but be interesting to you. Her constancy in  wishing to marry me, which she maintained under difficulties of every  description, has been the foundation of all that touched the family  afterwards. You know, I believe, that your poor father was the chief  promoter, though also the Yorks were; but our correspondence from 1814  till 1816 was entirely carried on through his kind intervention; it  would otherwise have been impossible, as she was really treated as a  sort of prisoner. Grant always to that good and generous Charlotte,  who sleeps already with her beautiful little boy so long, where all  will go to, an affectionate remembrance, and believe me she deserves  it.    Forgive my long letter, and see in it, what it really is, a token of  the great affection I have for you. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your  devoted Uncle.    LEOPOLD R.          _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _12th June 1845._    The Queen understands that the Deanery of Worcester has become vacant  by some new arrangement. Believing that Sir Robert's brother, Mr John  Peel, has a fair claim to such preferment, but being afraid that Sir  Robert would perhaps hesitate to recommend him on account of his near  relationship to him, the Queen wishes to offer herself this Deanery  through Sir Robert to his brother.          _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _12th June 1845._    Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, hastens to  acknowledge your Majesty's most kind and considerate communication,  and to express his grateful acknowledgments for it.    He must, in justice to his brother, assure your Majesty that he never  has expressed, and probably never would express, a wish to Sir Robert  Peel on the subject of preferment in the Church.    Sir Robert Peel might have hesitated to bring the name of one so  nearly connected with him under the notice of your Majesty, but as his  brother"]]]
