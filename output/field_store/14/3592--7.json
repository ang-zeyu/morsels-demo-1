Eighteen years later came another storm and vast floods; the  water rushed through the Abbey grounds, carrying away walls and bridges,  and was eight feet deep in the buildings. There were other floods; in  1265 the monks had to sleep where they could out of the water, and it  took days to clean away the silted mud. Those were some of the penalties  of being so conveniently near to a river.    [Illustration: _Waverley Abbey._]    [Illustration: _Waverley Abbey._]    Round the buildings accumulated the traditional virtues. The Annals of  Waverley record that in 1248 a youth fell by accident from the very  parapet of the church tower to the ground without receiving the smallest  injury. He was stupefied, and was thought to be dead, but after a little  while began to speak and to be sensible, and soon completely recovered.  On an earlier occasion, Aubrey tells us that \"a boy of seven or eight  years of age, standing near the Abbey gate, fell into the river, on the  Feast of the Invention of the Cross, and by the rapidity of the stream  was drove through four of the bridges, and was afterwards found on the  surface of the water, dead to all outward appearance; but being taken  out and carefully attended, he was brought to life, and came to his post  at the gate from whence he had not been missed nor inquired after.\"    When the church was dedicated in 1278--it had taken seventy-five years  to build--there was great rejoicing and a superb banquet. Nicholas de  Ely, Bishop of Winchester, to make the occasion splendid, supplied  feasting at his own expense for nine days to all who attended; abbots,  lords, knights and noble ladies came to the dedication, and on the first  day seven thousand and sixty-six guests sat down to meat. That is  Waverley's greatest record of hospitality. Another record belongs to a  guest. King John spent four days at the Abbey in Holy Week, 1208, and on  that occasion one R. de Cornhull was ordered to be paid five marks for  \"two tons of wine\" carried from Pagham.    [Illustration: _In the Grounds, Waverley Abbey._]    At the Dissolution Waverley's end came quickly. The Abbey was one of the  first of the smaller monasteries to fall. The obsequious adventurer whom  Thomas Cromwell sent to Waverley to report on the Abbey establishment  was Doctor Layton, and evidently he was neither feasted nor bribed by  the simple Abbot and his monks. Thus he writes to Cromwell after his  visit:--        To the right honorable Mr. Thomas Crumwell, chief secretary to the      King's highness.        It may please your mastership to understand that I have licenced the      bringer, the Abbot of Waverley, to repair unto you for liberty to      survey his husbandry whereupon consisteth the wealth of his      monastery. The man is honest, but none of the children of Solomon:      every monk within his house is his fellow, and every servant his      master. Mr. Treasurer and other gentlemen hath put servants unto him      whom the poor [fool?] dare neither command nor displease. Yesterday,      early in the morning, sitting in my chamber in examination, I could      neither get bread nor drink, neither fire of those knaves till I was      fretished; and the Abbot durst not speak to them. I called them all      before me, and forgot their names, but took from every man the keys      of his office, and made new officers for my time here, perchance as      stark knaves as the others. It shall be expedient for you to give      him a lesson and tell the poor fool what he should do. Among his      monks I found corruption of the worst sort, because they dwell in      the forest from all company. Thus I pray God preserve you. From      Waverley this morning early before day, ready to depart towards      Chichester, by the speedy hand of your most assured servant and poor      priest,        RICHARD LAYTON.    It is satisfactory to learn that the weasely Doctor was \"fretished,\"  which must be pretty nearly the same thing as perished with cold and  hunger. The Abbot's plea for his monastery--surely one of the honestest  letters ever written--sets in contrast the characters of the monastery  and its visitor. He writes to Cromwell on June 9, 1536:--        To the right honourable Master Secretary to the King.        Pleaseth your mastership I received your letters of the vij^th day      of this present month, and hath endeavoured myself to accomplish the      contents of them, and have sent your mastership the true extent,      value, and account of our said monastery. Beseeching your good      mastership, for the love of Christ's passion, to help to the      preservation of this poor monastery, that we your beadsmen may      remain in the service of God, with the meanest living that any poor      men may live with, in this world. So to continue in the service of      Almighty Jesus, and to pray for the estate of our prince and your      mastership. In no vain hope I write this to your mastership, for as      much you put me in such boldness full gently, when I was in suit to      you the last year at Winchester, saying, 'Repair to me for such      business as ye shall have from time to time.' Therefore, instantly      praying you, and my poor brethren with weeping yes!--desire you to      help them; in this world no creatures in more trouble. And so we      remain depending upon the comfort that shall come to us from      you--serving God daily at Waverley. From thence the ix^th day of      June, 1536.        WILLIAM, the poor Abbot there, your chaplain to command.    [Illustration: _Crooksbury Hill and Frensham Little Pond, from Frensham  Common._]    The comfort that came to the White Monks was the dissolution of the  Abbey in the month following. After the dissolution the buildings fell  gradually to pieces, generously helped by builders of other houses. When  Sir William More was giving Loseley near Guildford the shape we see  to-day he carted waggon-load after waggon-load of stone from the ruined  church, and Sir William More was perhaps not the first and certainly not  the last of the spoilers. The neighbourhood quarried from the ruins  until only a few years ago. When Aubrey saw the Abbey in 1672 he found  the walls of a church, cloisters, a chapel used as a stable, and part of  the house with its window-glass intact, and paintings of St. Dunstan and  the devil, pincers, crucibles and all. To-day most of the ruins have  fallen flat. There is some beautiful vaulting left, and massive heaps of  stone show the corners and boundaries of the church and other buildings.  Ivy-stems, coils of green gigantic pythons, climb about the walls and  broken doorways; pigeons nest on the window-ledges and clatter like  frightened genii out over the field.    Above Moor Park, a landmark for miles round, Crooksbury Hill lifts like  a dark pyramid. Crooksbury Hill has a dozen different wardrobes. You may  wake to find her grey in the morning, you may leave her behind you  grey-green with the sun full on her flank, you may turn at noon to find  the sun lighting her deep emerald; she is sunniest and hottest in a  shining blue; and in the evening with the setting sun behind her she  cloaks herself in purple and black as if her pines belonged to Scotland.  She cannot see so far as Chanctonbury Ring, which is the watching  comrade of all walkers in the country of the South Downs, and she has  not the height of Leith Hill or Hindhead; but she is the grave and  constant companion of all travellers for many miles round her, and  measures for them the angle of the sun or the slope of the stars, as do  all good landmarks for those who love a landmark like a friend.

The Maypole      at Compton.--The two-storied sanctuary.--A great      picture.--Bird-baths.--Swarming bees.--The Hog's Back; a noble      highway.      If any of the pilgrims from Farnham were drawn aside down the banks of  the Wey to the hospitality of Waverley Abbey, they probably rejoined the  rest at the foot of the Hog's Back, perhaps near Whitewaysend. That is a  name with some meaning, for here first the road from Farnham runs up on  to the great chalk ridge which traverses the county from west to east.  The break in the colour of the roads under the ridge is from bright  yellow sand to staring white, but the full white does not begin until  the road is almost at its highest level, at the cross-roads above  Tongham.    Tongham is the only village between Farnham and Guildford north of the  Hog's Back and near the ridge, and though there is little in it for  antiquarians, the pretty little white inn and the oasthouses have often  attracted painters, and the approach to the village from the south is  by a road pillared and canopied with lofty elms. The churchyard holds a  curious structure. A slender oak tower, recently erected as a memorial,  stands apart from the church, riveted to the ground with iron struts,  and contains a peal of thirteen small bells. A carillon is rung every  Sunday and Wednesday; I have not heard it, but have been told that it  sounds \"like sheep-bells.\"    [Illustration: _Tongham Church, with Wooden Tower for Bells._]    Not much can have been written about the older days of Tongham, but at  least one delightful passage in a modern book belongs to it, and should  be read under the great elms by the roadside. In Mr. George Bourne's  _Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer_, Bettesworth describes an almost  incredible feat of carting timber:--        \"I see a carter once,\" said Bettesworth, \"get three big elm-trees up      on to a timber-carriage, with only hisself and the hosses. He put      the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#11)"],[1,"he owed his brilliant  position to the reputation of his country, not to his own. \"If I had  been a Seriphian,\" said he, \"even I should never have been famous, nor  would you if you had been an Athenian.\" Something like this may be said  of old age. For the philosopher himself could not find old age easy  to bear in the depths of poverty, nor the fool feel it anything but a  burden though he were a millionaire. You may be sure, my dear Scipio  and Laelius, that the arms best adapted to old age are culture and the  active exercise of the virtues. For if they have been maintained at  every period--if one has lived much as well as long--the harvest they  produce is wonderful, not only because they never fail us even in our  last days (though that in itself is supremely important), but also  because the consciousness of a well-spent life and the recollection of  many virtuous actions are exceedingly delightful.    4. Take the case of Q. Fabius Maximus, the man, I mean, who recovered  Tarentum. When I was a young man and he an old one, I was as much  attached to him as if he had been my contemporary. For that great man's  serious dignity was tempered by courteous manners, nor had old age made  any change in his character. True, he was not exactly an old man when my  devotion to him began, yet he was nevertheless well on in life; for his  first consulship fell in the year after my birth. When quite a stripling  I went with him in his fourth consulship as a soldier in the ranks, on  the expedition against Capua, and in the fifth year after that against  Tarentum. Four years after that I was elected Quaestor, holding office  in the consulship of Tuditanus and Cethegus, in which year, indeed,  he as a very old man spoke in favour of the Cincian law \"on gifts and  fees.\"    Now this man conducted wars with all the spirit of youth when he was far  advanced in life, and by his persistence gradually wearied out Hannibal,  when rioting in all the confidence of youth. How brilliant are those  lines of my friend Ennius on him!         For us, down beaten by the storms of fate,       One man by wise delays restored the State.       Praise or dispraise moved not his constant mood,       True to his purpose, to his country's good!       Down ever-lengthening avenues of fame       Thus shines and shall shine still his glorious name.    Again what vigilance, what profound skill did he show in the capture of  Tarentum! It was indeed in my hearing that he made the famous retort to  Salinator, who had retreated into the citadel after losing the town: \"It  was owing to me, Quintus Fabius, that you retook Tarentum.\" \"Quite so,\"  he replied with a laugh; \"for had you not lost it, I should never have  recovered it.\" Nor was he less eminent in civil life than in war. In his  second consulship, though his colleague would not move in the matter, he  resisted as long as he could the proposal of the tribune C. Flaminius  to divide the territory of the Picenians and Gauls in free allotments in  defiance of a resolution of the Senate. Again, though he was an augur,  he ventured to say that whatever was done in the interests of the State  was done with the best possible auspices, that any laws proposed against  its interest were proposed against the auspices. I was cognisant of much  that was admirable in that great man, but nothing struck me with greater  astonishment than the way in which he bore the death of his son--a man  of brilliant character and who had been consul. His funeral speech  over him is in wide circulation, and when we read it, is there any  philosopher of whom we do not think meanly? Nor in truth was he only  great in the light of day and in the sight of his fellow-citizens;  he was still more eminent in private and at home. What a wealth of  conversation! What weighty maxims! What a wide acquaintance with ancient  history! What an accurate knowledge of the science of augury! For a  Roman, too, he had a great tincture of letters. He had a tenacious  memory for military history of every sort, whether of Roman or  foreign wars. And I used at that time to enjoy his conversation with a  passionate eagerness, as though I already divined, what actually turned  out to be the case, that when he died there would be no one to teach me  anything.    5. What then is the purpose of such a long disquisition on Maximus? It  is because you now see that an old age like his cannot conscientiously  be called unhappy. Yet it is after all true that everybody cannot be a  Scipio or a Maximus, with stormings of cities, with battles by land and  sea, with wars in which they themselves commanded, and with triumphs to  recall. Besides this there is a quiet, pure, and cultivated life which  produces a calm and gentle old age, such as we have been told Plato's  was, who died at his writing-desk in his eighty-first year; or like that  of Isocrates, who says that he wrote the book called The Panegyric in  his ninety-fourth year, and who lived for five years afterwards; while  his master Gorgias of Leontini completed a hundred and seven years  without ever relaxing his diligence or giving up work. When some one  asked him why he consented to remain so long alive--\"I have no fault,\"  said he, \"to find with old age.\" That was a noble answer, and worthy of  a scholar. For fools impute their own frailties and guilt to old age,  contrary to the practice of Ennui, whom I mentioned just now. In the  lines--         Like some brave steed that oft before       The Olympic wreath of victory bore,       Now by the weight of years oppressed,       Forgets the race, and takes his rest--    he compares his own old age to that of a high-spirited and successful  race-horse. And him indeed you may very well remember. For the present  consuls Titus Flamininus and Manius Acilius were elected in the  nineteenth year after his death; and his death occurred in the  consulship of Caepio and Philippus, the latter consul for the second  time: in which year I, then sixty-six years old, spoke in favour of  the Voconian law in a voice that was still strong and with lungs  still sound; while be, though seventy years old, supported two burdens  considered the heaviest of all--poverty and old age--in such a way as to  be all but fond of them.    The fact is that when I come to think it over, I find that there are  four reasons for old age being thought unhappy: First, that it withdraws  us from active employments; second, that it enfeebles the body; third,  that it deprives us of nearly all physical pleasures; fourth, that it is  the next step to death. Of each of these reasons, if you will allow me,  let us examine the force and justice separately.    6. OLD AGE WITHDRAWS US FROM ACTIVE EMPLOYMENTS. From which of them? Do  you mean from those carried on by youth and bodily strength? Are  there then no old men's employments to be after all conducted by the  intellect, even when bodies are weak? So then Q. Maximus did  nothing; nor L. Aemilius--our father, Scipio, and my excellent son's  father-in-law! So with other old men--the Fabricii, the Guru and  Coruncanii--when they were supporting the State by their advice and  influence, they were doing nothing! To old age Appius Claudius had the  additional disadvantage of being blind; yet it was he who, when the  Senate was inclining towards a peace with Pyrrhus and was for making a  treaty, did not hesitate to say what Ennius has embalmed in the verses:         Whither have swerved the souls so firm of yore?       Is sense grown senseless? Can feet stand no more?    And so on in a tone of the most passionate vehemence. You know the  poem, and the speech of Appius himself is extant. Now, he delivered  it seventeen years after his second consulship, there having been an  interval of ten years between the two consulships, and he having been  censor before his previous consulship. This will show you that at the  time of the war with Pyrrhus he was a very old man. Yet this is the  story handed down to us.    There is therefore nothing in the arguments of those who say that old  age takes no part in public business. They are like men who would say  that a steersman does nothing in sailing a ship, because, while some  of the crew are climbing the masts, others hurrying up and down the  gangways, others pumping out the bilge water, he sits quietly in the  stern holding the tiller. He does not do what young men do; nevertheless  he does what is much more important and better. The great affairs of  life are not performed by physical strength, or activity, or nimbleness  of body, but by deliberation, character, expression of opinion. Of these  old age is not only not deprived, but, as a rule, has them in a greater  degree. Unless by any chance I, who as a soldier in the ranks, as  military tribune, as legate, and as consul have been employed in various  kinds of war, now appear to you to be idle because not actively engaged  in war. But I enjoin upon the Senate what is to be done, and how.  Carthage has long been harbouring evil designs, and I accordingly  proclaim war against her in good time. I shall never cease to entertain  fears about her till I hear of her having been levelled with the ground.  The glory of doing that I pray that the immortal gods may reserve  for you, Scipio, so that you may complete the task begun by your  grand-father, now dead more than thirty-two years ago; though all years  to come will keep that great man's memory green. He died in the year  before my censorship, nine years after my consulship, having been  returned consul for the second time in my own consulship. If then he had  lived to his hundredth year, would he have regretted having lived to be  old? For he would of course not have been practising rapid marches, nor  dashing on a foe, nor hurling spears from a distance, nor using swords  at close quarters--but only counsel, reason, and senatorial eloquence.  And if those qualities had not resided in us _seniors_,"]]]
