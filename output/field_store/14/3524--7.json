Tad's nature was the opposite of Willie's, and he  was always regarded as his father's favorite child. His black eyes  fairly sparkled with mischief.    The war progressed, fair fields had been stained with blood, thousands  of brave men had fallen, and thousands of eyes were weeping for the  fallen at home. There were desolate hearthstones in the South as well as  in the North, and as the people of my race watched the sanguinary  struggle, the ebb and flow of the tide of battle, they lifted their  faces Zionward, as if they hoped to catch a glimpse of the Promised Land  beyond the sulphureous clouds of smoke which shifted now and then but to  reveal ghastly rows of new-made graves. Sometimes the very life of the  nation seemed to tremble with the fierce shock of arms. In 1863 the  Confederates were flushed with victory, and sometimes it looked as if  the proud flag of the Union, the glorious old Stars and Stripes, must  yield half its nationality to the tri-barred flag that floated grandly  over long columns of gray. These were sad, anxious days to Mr. Lincoln,  and those who saw the man in privacy only could tell how much he  suffered. One day he came into the room where I was fitting a dress on  Mrs. Lincoln. His step was slow and heavy, and his face sad. Like a  tired child he threw himself upon a sofa, and shaded his eyes with his  hands. He was a complete picture of dejection. Mrs. Lincoln, observing  his troubled look, asked:    \"Where have you been, father?\"    \"To the War Department,\" was the brief, almost sullen answer.    \"Any news?\"    \"Yes, plenty of news, but no good news. It is dark, dark everywhere.\"    He reached forth one of his long arms, and took a small Bible from a  stand near the head of the sofa, opened the pages of the holy book, and  soon was absorbed in reading them. A quarter of an hour passed, and on  glancing at the sofa the face of the President seemed more cheerful. The  dejected look was gone, and the countenance was lighted up with new  resolution and hope. The change was so marked that I could not but  wonder at it, and wonder led to the desire to know what book of the  Bible afforded so much comfort to the reader. Making the search for a  missing article an excuse, I walked gently around the sofa, and looking  into the open book, I discovered that Mr. Lincoln was reading that  divine comforter, Job. He read with Christian eagerness, and the courage  and hope that he derived from the inspired pages made him a new man. I  almost imagined that I could hear the Lord speaking to him from out the  whirlwind of battle: \"Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of  thee, and declare thou unto me.\" What a sublime picture was this! A  ruler of a mighty nation going to the pages of the Bible with simple  Christian earnestness for comfort and courage, and finding both in the  darkest hours of a nation's calamity. Ponder it, O ye scoffers at God's  Holy Word, and then hang your heads for very shame!    Frequent letters were received warning Mr. Lincoln of assassination, but  he never gave a second thought to the mysterious warnings. The letters,  however, sorely troubled his wife. She seemed to read impending danger  in every rustling leaf, in every whisper of the wind.    \"Where are you going now, father?\" she would say to him, as she observed  him putting on his overshoes and shawl.    \"I am going over to the War Department, mother, to try and learn some  news.\"    \"But, father, you should not go out alone. You know you are surrounded  with danger.\"    \"All imagination. What does any one want to harm me for? Don't worry  about me, mother, as if I were a little child, for no one is going to  molest me;\" and with a confident, unsuspecting air he would close the  door behind him, descend the stairs, and pass out to his lonely walk.    For weeks, when trouble was anticipated, friends of the President would  sleep in the White House to guard him from danger.    Robert would come home every few months, bringing new joy to the family  circle. He was very anxious to quit school and enter the army, but the  move was sternly opposed by his mother.    \"We have lost one son, and his loss is as much as I can bear, without  being called upon to make another sacrifice,\" she would say, when the  subject was under discussion.    \"But many a poor mother has given up all her sons,\" mildly suggested Mr.  Lincoln, \"and our son is not more dear to us than the sons of other  people are to their mothers.\"    \"That may be; but I cannot bear to have Robert exposed to danger. His  services are not required in the field, and the sacrifice would be a  needless one.\"    \"The services of every man who loves his country are required in this  war. You should take a liberal instead of a selfish view of the  question, mother.\"    Argument at last prevailed, and permission was granted Robert to enter  the army. With the rank of Captain and A. D. C. he went to the field,  and remained in the army till the close of the war.    I well recollect a little incident that gave me a clearer insight into  Robert's character. He was at home at the time the Tom Thumb combination  was at Washington. The marriage of little Hopo'-my-thumb--Charles  Stratton--to Miss Warren created no little excitement in the world, and  the people of Washington participated in the general curiosity. Some of  Mrs. Lincoln's friends made her believe that it was the duty of Mrs.  Lincoln to show some attention to the remarkable dwarfs. Tom Thumb had  been caressed by royalty in the Old World, and why should not the wife  of the President of his native country smile upon him also? Verily, duty  is one of the greatest bugbears in life. A hasty reception was arranged,  and cards of invitation issued. I had dressed Mrs. Lincoln, and she was  ready to go below and receive her guests, when Robert entered his  mother's room.    \"You are at leisure this afternoon, are you not, Robert?\"    \"Yes, mother.\"    \"Of course, then, you will dress and come down-stairs.\"    \"No, mother, I do not propose to assist in entertaining Tom Thumb. My  notions of duty, perhaps, are somewhat different from yours.\"    Robert had a lofty soul, and he could not stoop to all of the follies  and absurdities of the ephemeral current of fashionable life.    Mrs. Lincoln's love for her husband sometimes prompted her to act very  strangely. She was extremely jealous of him, and if a lady desired to  court her displeasure, she could select no surer way to do it than to  pay marked attention to the President. These little jealous freaks often  were a source of perplexity to Mr. Lincoln. If it was a reception for  which they were dressing, he would come into her room to conduct her  downstairs, and while pulling on his gloves ask, with a merry twinkle in  his eyes:    \"Well, mother, who must I talk with to-night--shall it be Mrs. D.?\"    \"That deceitful woman! No, you shall not listen to her flattery.\"    \"Well, then, what do you say to Miss C.? She is too young and handsome  to practise deceit.\"    \"Young and handsome, you call her! You should not judge beauty for me.  No, she is in league with Mrs. D., and you shall not talk with her.\"    \"Well, mother, I must talk with some one. Is there any one that you do  not object to?\" trying to button his glove, with a mock expression of  gravity.    \"I don't know as it is necessary that you should talk to anybody in  particular. You know well enough, Mr. Lincoln, that I do not approve of  your flirtations with silly women, just as if you were a beardless boy,  fresh from school.\"    \"But, mother, I insist that I must talk with somebody. I can't stand  around like a simpleton, and say nothing. If you will not tell me who I  may talk with, please tell me who I may _not_ talk with.\"    \"There is Mrs. D. and Miss C. in particular. I detest them both. Mrs. B.  also will come around you, but you need not listen to her flattery.  These are the ones in particular.\"    \"Very well, mother; now that we have settled the question to your  satisfaction, we will go down-stairs;\" and always with stately dignity,  he proffered his arm and led the way.

I soon learned that  the wife of the President had no love for Mr. Salmon P. Chase, at that  time Secretary of the Treasury. She was well versed in human character,  was somewhat suspicious of those by whom she was surrounded, and often  her judgment was correct. Her intuition about the sincerity of  individuals was more accurate than that of her husband. She looked  beyond, and read the reflection of action in the future. Her hostility  to Mr. Chase was very bitter. She claimed that he was a selfish  politician instead of a true patriot, and warned Mr. Lincoln not to  trust him too far. The daughter of the Secretary was quite a belle in  Washington, and Mrs. Lincoln, who was jealous of the popularity of  others, had no desire to build up her social position through political  favor to her father. Miss Chase, now Mrs. Senator Sprague, was a lovely  woman, and was worthy of all the admiration she received. Mr. Lincoln  was more confiding than his wife. He never suspected the fidelity of  those who claimed to be his friends. Honest to the very core himself,  and frank as a child, he never dreamed of questioning the sincerity of  others.    \"Father, I do wish that you would inquire a little into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25"],[0,"The 1991 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"_#_Other political or pressure groups: Antigua Caribbean Liberation  Movement (ACLM), a small leftist nationalist group led by Leonard (Tim)  HECTOR; Antigua Trades and Labor Union (ATLU), headed by Noel THOMAS      _#_Member of: ACP, C, CARICOM, CDB, ECLAC, FAO, G-77, GATT, IBRD,  ICAO, ICFTU, IFAD, IFC, ILO, IMF, IMO, INTERPOL, IOC, ITU, NAM  (observer), OAS, OECS, OPANAL, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, WCL, WHO, WMO      _#_Diplomatic representation: Ambassador Edmund Hawkins LAKE;  Chancery at Suite 2H, 3400 International Drive NW, Washington DC 20008;  telephone (202) 362-5211 or 5166, 5122, 5225; there is an Antiguan  Consulate in Miami;    US--the US Ambassador to Barbados is accredited to Antigua and  Barbuda, and in his absence, the Embassy is headed by Charge d'Affaires  Bryant SALTER; Embassy at Queen Elizabeth Highway, Saint John's  (mailing address is FPO Miami 34054); telephone (809) 462-3505 or 3506      _#_Flag: red with an inverted isosceles triangle based on the top edge  of the flag; the triangle contains three horizontal bands of black (top),  light blue, and white with a yellow rising sun in the black band      _*_Economy  _#_Overview: The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism  the most important determinant of economic performance.
