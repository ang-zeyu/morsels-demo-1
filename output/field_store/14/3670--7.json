Emily looked  with some degree of terror on the savage countenances of these people,  shewn by the fire, which heightened the romantic effects of the scenery,  as it threw a red dusky gleam upon the rocks and on the foliage of the  trees, leaving heavy masses of shade and regions of obscurity, which the  eye feared to penetrate.    They were preparing their supper; a large pot stood by the fire, over  which several figures were busy. The blaze discovered a rude kind of  tent, round which many children and dogs were playing, and the whole  formed a picture highly grotesque. The travellers saw plainly their  danger. Valancourt was silent, but laid his hand on one of St. Aubert's  pistols; St. Aubert drew forth another, and Michael was ordered to  proceed as fast as possible. They passed the place, however,  without being attacked; the rovers being probably unprepared for the  opportunity, and too busy about their supper to feel much interest, at  the moment, in any thing besides.    After a league and a half more, passed in darkness, the travellers  arrived at Beaujeu, and drove up to the only inn the place afforded;  which, though superior to any they had seen since they entered the  mountains, was bad enough.    The surgeon of the town was immediately sent for, if a surgeon he could  be called, who prescribed for horses as well as for men, and shaved  faces at least as dexterously as he set bones. After examining  Valancourt's arm, and perceiving that the bullet had passed through  the flesh without touching the bone, he dressed it, and left him with  a solemn prescription of quiet, which his patient was not inclined to  obey. The delight of ease had now succeeded to pain; for ease may be  allowed to assume a positive quality when contrasted with anguish; and,  his spirits thus re-animated, he wished to partake of the conversation  of St. Aubert and Emily, who, released from so many apprehensions, were  uncommonly cheerful. Late as it was, however, St. Aubert was obliged to  go out with the landlord to buy meat for supper; and Emily, who, during  this interval, had been absent as long as she could, upon excuses of  looking to their accommodation, which she found rather better than she  expected, was compelled to return, and converse with Valancourt alone.  They talked of the character of the scenes they had passed, of the  natural history of the country, of poetry, and of St. Aubert; a subject  on which Emily always spoke and listened to with peculiar pleasure.    The travellers passed an agreeable evening; but St. Aubert was fatigued  with his journey; and, as Valancourt seemed again sensible of pain, they  separated soon after supper.    In the morning St. Aubert found that Valancourt had passed a restless  night; that he was feverish, and his wound very painful. The surgeon,  when he dressed it, advised him to remain quietly at Beaujeu; advice  which was too reasonable to be rejected. St. Aubert, however, had no  favourable opinion of this practitioner, and was anxious to commit  Valancourt into more skilful hands; but learning, upon enquiry, that  there was no town within several leagues which seemed more likely to  afford better advice, he altered the plan of his journey, and determined  to await the recovery of Valancourt, who, with somewhat more ceremony  than sincerity, made many objections to this delay.    By order of his surgeon, Valancourt did not go out of the house that  day; but St. Aubert and Emily surveyed with delight the environs of  the town, situated at the feet of the Pyrenean Alps, that rose, some  in abrupt precipices, and others swelling with woods of cedar, fir, and  cypress, which stretched nearly to their highest summits. The cheerful  green of the beech and mountain-ash was sometimes seen, like a gleam of  light, amidst the dark verdure of the forest; and sometimes a torrent  poured its sparkling flood, high among the woods.    Valancourt's indisposition detained the travellers at Beaujeu several  days, during which interval St. Aubert had observed his disposition and  his talents with the philosophic inquiry so natural to him. He saw  a frank and generous nature, full of ardour, highly susceptible of  whatever is grand and beautiful, but impetuous, wild, and somewhat  romantic. Valancourt had known little of the world. His perceptions were  clear, and his feelings just; his indignation of an unworthy, or his  admiration of a generous action, were expressed in terms of equal  vehemence. St. Aubert sometimes smiled at his warmth, but seldom checked  it, and often repeated to himself, 'This young man has never been at  Paris.' A sigh sometimes followed this silent ejaculation. He determined  not to leave Valancourt till he should be perfectly recovered; and, as  he was now well enough to travel, though not able to manage his horse,  St. Aubert invited him to accompany him for a few days in the carriage.  This he the more readily did, since he had discovered that Valancourt  was of a family of the same name in Gascony, with whose respectability  he was well acquainted. The latter accepted the offer with great  pleasure, and they again set forward among these romantic wilds about  Rousillon.    They travelled leisurely; stopping wherever a scene uncommonly grand  appeared; frequently alighting to walk to an eminence, whither the mules  could not go, from which the prospect opened in greater magnificence;  and often sauntering over hillocks covered with lavender, wild thyme,  juniper, and tamarisc; and under the shades of woods, between those  boles they caught the long mountain-vista, sublime beyond any thing that  Emily had ever imagined.    St. Aubert sometimes amused himself with botanizing, while Valancourt  and Emily strolled on; he pointing out to her notice the objects that  particularly charmed him, and reciting beautiful passages from such of  the Latin and Italian poets as he had heard her admire. In the pauses of  conversation, when he thought himself not observed, he frequently fixed  his eyes pensively on her countenance, which expressed with so much  animation the taste and energy of her mind; and when he spoke again,  there was a peculiar tenderness in the tone of his voice, that defeated  any attempt to conceal his sentiments. By degrees these silent pauses  became more frequent; till Emily, only, betrayed an anxiety to interrupt  them; and she; who had been hitherto reserved, would now talk again,  and again, of the woods and the vallies and the mountains, to avoid the  danger of sympathy and silence.    From Beaujeu the road had constantly ascended, conducting the travellers  into the higher regions of the air, where immense glaciers exhibited  their frozen horrors, and eternal snow whitened the summits of the  mountains. They often paused to contemplate these stupendous scenes,  and, seated on some wild cliff, where only the ilex or the larch could  flourish, looked over dark forests of fir, and precipices where human  foot had never wandered, into the glen--so deep, that the thunder of the  torrent, which was seen to foam along the bottom, was scarcely heard to  murmur. Over these crags rose others of stupendous height, and fantastic  shape; some shooting into cones; others impending far over their base,  in huge masses of granite, along whose broken ridges was often lodged  a weight of snow, that, trembling even to the vibration of a sound,  threatened to bear destruction in its course to the vale. Around, on  every side, far as the eye could penetrate, were seen only forms of  grandeur--the long perspective of mountain-tops, tinged with ethereal  blue, or white with snow; vallies of ice, and forests of gloomy fir.  The serenity and clearness of the air in these high regions were  particularly delightful to the travellers; it seemed to inspire them  with a finer spirit, and diffused an indescribable complacency over  their minds. They had no words to express the sublime emotions they  felt. A solemn expression characterized the feelings of St. Aubert;  tears often came to his eyes, and he frequently walked away from his  companions. Valancourt now and then spoke, to point to Emily's notice  some feature of the scene. The thinness of the atmosphere, through which  every object came so distinctly to the eye, surprised and deluded her;  who could scarcely believe that objects, which appeared so near, were,  in reality, so distant. The deep silence of these solitudes was broken  only at intervals by the scream of the vultures, seen cowering round  some cliff below, or by the cry of the eagle sailing high in the air;  except when the travellers listened to the hollow thunder that sometimes  muttered at their feet. While, above, the deep blue of the heavens was  unobscured by the lightest cloud, half way down the mountains, long  billows of vapour were frequently seen rolling, now wholly excluding the  country below, and now opening, and partially revealing its features.  Emily delighted to observe the grandeur of these clouds as they changed  in shape and tints, and to watch their various effect on the lower  world, whose features, partly veiled, were continually assuming new  forms of sublimity.    After traversing these regions for many leagues, they began to descend  towards Rousillon, and features of beauty then mingled with the scene.  Yet the travellers did not look back without some regret to the sublime  objects they had quitted; though the eye, fatigued with the extension  of its powers, was glad to repose on the verdure of woods and pastures,  that now hung on the margin of the river below; to view again the humble  cottage shaded by cedars, the playful group of mountaineer-children, and  the flowery nooks that appeared among the hills.    As they descended, they saw at a distance, on the right, one of the  grand passes of the Pyrenees into Spain, gleaming with its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#11)"],[1,". Snap it up! And you, you  goldbricks, get the lead out of your pants!\"    Kinnison followed directions. He found the ledge and emerged, scraping  thick and sticky mud from his uniform. He crawled across the little  plain. An occasional bullet whined through the air, far above him; but,  as the sergeant had said, this bit of terrain was \"in the clear.\" He  climbed the hill, approached the gaunt, bare tree-trunk. He heard men  moving, and cautiously announced himself.    \"OK., fella,\" came the sergeant's deep bass. \"Yeah, it's us. Shake a  leg!\"    \"That's easy!\" Kinnison laughed for the first time that day. \"I'm  shaking already, like a hula-hula dancer's empennage. What outfit is  this, and where are we?\"    \"BRROOM!\" The earth trembled, the air vibrated. Below and to the north,  almost exactly where the machine-guns had been, an awe-inspiring cloud  billowed majestically into the air; a cloud composed of smoke, vapor,  pulverized earth, chunks of rock, and debris of what had been trees. Nor  was it alone.    \"Crack! Bang! Tweet! Boom! Wham!\" Shells of all calibers, high explosive  and gas, came down in droves. The landscape disappeared. The little  company of Americans, in complete silence and with one mind, devoted  themselves to accumulating distance. Finally, when they had to stop for  breath:    \"Section B, attached to the 76th Field Artillery,\" the sergeant answered  the question as though it had just been asked. \"As to where we are,  somewhere between Berlin and Paris is about all I can tell you. We got  hell knocked out of us yesterday, and have been running around lost ever  since. They shot off a rally signal on top of this here hill, though,  and we was just going to shove off when we seen the krauts chasing you.\"    \"Thanks. I'd better rally with you, I guess--find out where we are, and  what's the chance of getting back to my own outfit.\"    \"Damn slim, I'd say. Boches are all around us here, thicker than fleas  on a dog.\"    They approached the summit, were challenged, were accepted. They saw a  gray-haired man--an old man, for such a location--seated calmly upon a  rock, smoking a cigarette. His smartly-tailored uniform, which fitted  perfectly his not-so-slender figure, was muddy and tattered. One leg of  his breeches was torn half away, revealing a blood-soaked bandage.  Although he was very evidently an officer, no insignia were visible. As  Kinnison and the gunners approached, a first lieutenant--practically  spic-and-span--spoke to the man on the rock.    \"First thing to do is to settle the matter of rank,\" he announced,  crisply. \"I'm First Lieutenant Randolph, of....\"    \"Rank, eh?\" The seated one grinned and spat out the butt of his  cigarette. \"But then, it was important to me, too, when I was a first  lieutenant--about the time that you were born. Slayton, Major-General.\"    \"Oh ... excuse me, sir....\"    \"Skip it. How many men you got, and what are they?\"    \"Seven, sir. We brought in a wire from Inf....\"    \"A _wire_! Hellanddamnation, why haven't you got it with you, then? Get  it!\"    The crestfallen officer disappeared; the general turned to Kinnison and  the sergeant.    \"Have you got any ammunition, sergeant?\"    \"Yes, sir. About thirty belts.\"    \"Thank God! We can use it, and you. As for you, Captain, I don't  know....\"    The wire came up. The general seized the instrument and cranked.    \"Get me Spearmint ... Spearmint? Slayton--give me Weatherby.... This is  Slayton ... yes, but ... No, but I want ... Hellanddamnation, Weatherby,  shut up and let me talk--don't you know that this wire's apt to be cut  any second? We're on top of Hill Fo-wer, Ni-yun, Sev-en--that's  right--about two hundred men; maybe three. Composite--somebody,  apparently, from half the outfits in France. Too fast and too far--both  flanks wide open--cut off ... Hello! Hello! Hello!\" He dropped the  instrument and turned to Kinnison. \"You want to go back, Captain, and I  need a runner--bad. Want to try to get through?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"First phone you come to, get Spearmint--General Weatherby. Tell him  Slayton says that we're cut off, but the Germans aren't in much force  nor in good position, and for God's sake to get some air and tanks in  here to keep them from consolidating. Just a minute. Sergeant, what's  your name?\" He studied the burly non-com minutely.    \"Wells, sir.\"    \"What would you say ought to be done with the machine-guns?\"    \"Cover that ravine, there, first. Then set up to enfilade if they try to  come up over there. Then, if I could find any more guns, I'd....\"    \"Enough. Second Lieutenant Wells, from now. GHQ will confirm. Take  charge of all the guns we have. Report when you have made disposition.  Now, Kinnison, listen. I can probably hold out until tonight. The enemy  doesn't know yet that we're here, but we are due for some action pretty  quick now, and when they locate us--if there aren't too many of their  own units here, too--they'll flatten this hill like a table. So tell  Weatherby to throw a column in here as soon as it gets dark, and to  advance Eight and Sixty, so as to consolidate this whole area. Got it?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Got a compass?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Pick up a tin hat and get going. A hair north of due west, about a  kilometer and a half. Keep cover, because the going will be tough. Then  you'll come to a road. It's a mess, but it's ours--or was, at last  accounts--so the worst of it will be over. On that road, which goes  south-west, about two kilometers further, you'll find a Post--you'll  know it by the motorcycles and such. Phone from there. Luck!\"    Bullets began to whine and the general dropped to the ground and crawled  toward a coppice, bellowing orders as he went. Kinnison crawled, too,  straight west, availing himself of all possible cover, until he  encountered a sergeant-major reclining against the south side of a great  tree.    \"Cigarette, buddy?\" that wight demanded.    \"Sure. Take the pack. I've got another that'll last me--maybe more. But  what the hell goes on here? Who ever heard of a major general getting  far enough up front to get shot in the leg, and he talks as though he  were figuring on licking the whole German army. Is the old bird nuts, or  what?\"    \"Not so you would notice it. Didn'cha ever hear of 'Hellandamnation'  Slayton? You will, buddy, you will. If Pershing doesn't give him three  stars after this, he's crazier than hell. He ain't supposed to be on  combat at all--he's from GHQ and can make or break anybody in the AEF.  Out here on a look-see trip and couldn't get back. But you got to hand  it to him--he's getting things organized in great shape. I came in with  him--I'm about all that's left of them that did--just waiting for this  breeze to die down, but its getting worse. We'd better duck--over  there!\"    Bullets whistled and stormed, breaking more twigs and branches from the  already shattered, practically denuded trees. The two slid precipitately  into the indicated shell-hole, into stinking mud. Wells' guns burst into  action.    \"Damn! I hated to do this,\" the sergeant grumbled, \"On accounta I just  got half dry.\"    \"Wise me up,\" Kinnison directed. \"The more I know about things, the more  apt I am to get through.\"    \"This is what is left of two battalions, and a lot of casuals. They made  objective, but it turns out the outfits on their right and left  couldn't, leaving their flanks right out in the open air. Orders come in  by blinker to rectify the line by falling back, but by then it couldn't  be done. Under observation.\"    Kinnison nodded. He knew what a barrage would have done to a force  trying to cross such open ground in daylight.    \"One man could prob'ly make it, though, if he was careful and kept his  eyes wide open,\" the sergeant-major continued. \"But you ain't got no  binoculars, have you?\"    \"No.\"    \"Get a pair easy enough. You saw them boots without any hobnails in 'em,  sticking out from under some blankets?\"    \"Yes. I get you.\" Kinnison knew that combat officers did not wear  hobnails, and usually carried binoculars. \"How come so many at once?\"    \"Just about all the officers that got this far. Conniving, my guess is,  behind old Slayton's back. Anyway, a kraut aviator spots 'em and dives.  Our machine-guns got him, but not until after he heaved a bomb. Dead  center. Christ, what a mess! But there's six-seven good glasses in  there. I'd grab one myself, but the general would see it--he can see  right through the lid of a mess-kit. Well, the boys have shut those  krauts up, so I'll hunt the old man up and tell him what I found out.  _Damn_ this mud!\"    Kinnison emerged sinuously and snaked his way to a row of blanket  covered forms. He lifted a blanket and gasped: then vomited up  everything, it seemed, that he had eaten for days. But he _had_ to have  the binoculars.    He got them.    Then, still retching, white and shaken, he crept westward; availing  himself of every possible item of cover.    For some time, from a point somewhere north of his route, a machine-gun  had been intermittently at work. It was close; but the very loudness of  its noise, confused as it was by resounding echoes, made it impossible  to locate at all exactly the weapon's position. Kinnison crept forward  inchwise; scanning every foot of visible terrain through his powerful  glass. He knew by the sound that it was German. More, since what he did  not know about machine-guns could have been printed in bill-poster type  upon the back of his hand, he knew that it was a Maxim, Model 1907--a  mean, mean gun. He deduced that it was doing plenty of damage to his  fellows back on the hill, and that they had not been able to do much of  anything about it. And it was beautifully hidden; even he, close as he  must be, couldn't see it. But damn it, there _had_ to be a....    Minute after minute, unmoving save for the traverse of his binoculars,  he searched, and finally he found. A tiny plume--the veriest wisp--of  vapor,"]]]
