In several  states the head of the Bureau made arrangements for local magistrates  and officials to act as Bureau officials, and in such cases the two  authorities acted in cooperation. The army of occupation, too, exerted  an authority which not infrequently interfered with the workings of the  new state government. Nearly everywhere there was a lack of certainty  and efficiency due to the concurrent and sometimes conflicting  jurisdictions of state government, army commanders, Bureau authorities,  and even the President acting upon or through any of the others.    The standing of the Southern state organizations was in doubt after the  refusal of Congress to recognize them. Nevertheless, in spite of this  uncertainty they continued to function as states during the year of  controversy which followed; the courts were opened and steadily grew  in influence; here and there militia and patrols were reorganized;  officials who refused to \"accept the situation\" were dismissed;  elections were held; the legislatures revised the laws to fit new  conditions and enacted new laws for the emancipated blacks. To all this  progress in reorganization, the action of Congress was a severe blow,  since it gave notice that none of the problems of reconstruction were  yet solved. An increasing spirit of irritation and independence was  observed throughout the states in question, and at the elections the  former Confederates gained more and more offices. The year was marked  in the South by the tendency toward the formation of parties, by the  development of the \"Southern outrages\" issue, by an attempt to frustrate  radical action, and finally by a lineup of the great mass of the whites  in opposition to the Fourteenth Amendment and other radical plans of  Congress.    The Joint Committee on Reconstruction, appointed when Congress refused  to accept the work of President Johnson, proceeded during several months  to take testimony and to consider measures. The testimony, which was  taken chiefly to support opinions already formed, appeared to prove that  the Negroes and the Unionists were so badly treated that the Freedmen's  Bureau and the army must be kept in the South to protect them; that free  Negro labor was a success but that the whites were hostile to it; that  the whites were disloyal and would, if given control of the Southern  governments and admitted to Congress, constitute a danger to the nation  and especially to the party in power.    To convince the voters of the North of the necessity of dealing  drastically with the South a campaign of misrepresentation was begun  in the summer of 1865, which became more and more systematic and  unscrupulous as the political struggle at Washington grew fiercer.  Newspapers regularly ran columns headed \"Southern Outrages,\" and every  conceivable mistreatment of blacks by whites was represented as taking  place on a large scale. As General Richard Taylor said, it would seem  that about 1866 every white man, woman, and child in the South began  killing and maltreating Negroes. In truth, there was less and less  ground for objection to the treatment of the blacks as time went on and  as the several agencies of government secured firmer control over the  lawless elements. But fortunately for the radicals their contention  seemed to be established by riots on a large scale in Memphis and New  Orleans where Negroes were killed and injured in much greater number  than whites.    The rapid development of the radical plans of Congress checked the  tendency toward political division in the South. Only a small party of  rabid Unionists would now affiliate with the radicals, while all  the others reluctantly held together, endorsed Johnson's policy, and  attempted to affiliate with the disintegrating National Union party.  But the defeat of the President's policies in the elections of 1866, the  increasing radicalism of Congress as shown by the Civil Rights Act, the  expansion of the Freedmen's Bureau, the report of the Joint Committee  on Reconstruction, and the proposal of the Fourteenth Amendment led  farsighted Southerners to see that the President was likely to lose in  his fight with Congress.    Now began, in the latter half of 1866, with some cooperation in the  North and probably with the approval of the President, a movement in the  South to forestall the radicals by means of a settlement which, although  less severe than the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, might yet be  acceptable to Congress. One feature of the settlement was to be some  form of Negro suffrage, either by local action or by constitutional  amendment. Those behind this scheme were mainly of the former governing  class. Negro suffrage, they thought, would take the wind out of the  radical sails, the Southern whites would soon be able to control the  blacks, representation in Congress would be increased, and the Black  Belt would perhaps regain its former political hegemony. It is hardly  necessary to say that the majority of the whites were solidly opposed to  such a measure. But it was hoped to carry it under pressure through  the legislature or to bring it about indirectly through rulings of the  Freedmen's Bureau.    Coincident with this scheme of partial Negro suffrage an attempt  was made by the conservative leaders in Washington, working with the  Southerners, to propose a revised Fourteenth Amendment which would  give the vote to competent Negroes and not disfranchise the whites. A  conference of Southern governors met in Washington early in 1867 and  drafted such an amendment. But, it was too late.    Meanwhile the Fourteenth Amendment submitted by Congress had been  brought before the Southern legislatures, and during the winter of  1866-67 it was rejected by all of them. There was strong opposition  to it because it disfranchised the leading whites, but perhaps the  principal reason for its rejection was that the Southern people were not  sure that still more severe conditions might not be imposed later.    While the President was \"restoring\" the states which had seceded and  struggling with Congress, the Border States of the South, including  Tennessee (which was admitted in 1866 by reason of its radical state  government), were also in the throes of reconstruction. Though there was  less military interference in these than in the other states, many of  the problems were similar. All had the Freedmen's Bureau, the Negro  race, the Unionists, and the Confederates; in every state, except  Kentucky, Confederates were persecuted, the minority was in control, and  \"ring\" rule was the order of the day; but in each state there were  signs of the political revolution which a few years later was to put the  radicals out of power.    The executive plan for the restoration of the Union, begun by Lincoln  and adopted by Johnson, was, as we have seen, at first applied in all  the states which had seceded. A military governor was appointed in each  state by the President by virtue of his authority as commander in chief.  This official, aided by a civilian staff of his own choice and supported  by the United States army and other Federal agencies, reorganized the  state administration and after a few months turned the state and local  governments over to regularly elected officials. Restoration should  now have been completed, but Congress refused to admit the senators  and representatives of these states, and entered upon a fifteen  months' struggle with the President over details of the methods of the  reconstruction. Meanwhile the Southern States, though unrepresented  in Congress, continued their activities, with some interference from  Federal authorities, until Congress in 1867 declared their governments  nonexistent.    The work begun by Lincoln and Johnson deserved better success. The  original plan restored to political rights only a small number of  Unionists, the lukewarm Confederates, and the unimportant. But in spite  of the threatening speeches of Johnson, he used his power of pardon  until none except the most prominent leaders were excluded. The  personnel of the Johnson governments was fair. The officials were,  in the main, former Douglas Democrats and Whigs, respectable and  conservative, but not admired or loved by the people. The conventions  and the legislatures were orderly and dignified and manifested a desire  to accept the situation.    There were no political parties at first, but material for several  existed. If things had been allowed to take their course, there would  have arisen a normal cleavage between former Whigs and Democrats,  between the upcountry and the low country, between the slaveholders  and the nonslaveholders. The average white man in these governments was  willing to be fair to the Negro but was not greatly concerned about his  future. In the view of most white people, it was the white man who was  emancipated. The white districts had no desire to let the power return  to the Black Belt by giving the Negro the ballot, for the vote of the  Negroes, they believed, would be controlled by their former masters.    Johnson's adoption of Lincoln's plan gave notice to all that the  radicals had failed to control him. He and they had little in common;  they wished to uproot a civilization, while he wished to punish  individuals; they were not troubled by constitutional scruples, while he  was the strictest of State Rights Democrats; they thought principally  of the Negro and his potentialities, while Johnson was thinking of the  emancipated white man. It is possible that Lincoln might have succeeded,  but for Johnson the task proved too great.        CHAPTER IV. THE WARDS OF THE NATION    The Negroes at the close of the war were not slaves or serfs, nor were  they citizens. What was to be done with them and for them? The Southern  answer to this question may be found in the so-called \"Black Laws,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#11)"],[1,"nd,\" and  there at Gravesend she is buried. Her son, Thomas Rolfe, who was brought  up in England, returned at last to Virginia and lived out his life there  with his wife and children. Today no small host of Americans have for  ancestress the daughter of Powhatan. In England-in-America the immediate  effect of the marriage was really to procure an Indian peace outlasting  Pocahontas's brief life.    In Dale's years there rises above the English horizon the cloud of New  France. The old, disaster-haunted Huguenot colony in Florida was a thing  of the past, to be mourned for when the Spaniard wiped it out--for  at that time England herself was not in America. But now that she  was established there, with some hundreds of men in a Virginia that  stretched from Spanish Florida to Nova Scotia, the French shadow seemed  ominous. And just in this farther region, amid fir-trees and snow, upon  the desolate Bay of Fundy, the French for some years had been keeping  the breath of life in a huddle of cabins named Port Royal. More than  this, and later than the Port Royal building, Frenchmen--Jesuits  that!--were trying a settlement on an island now called Mount Desert,  off a coast now named Maine. The Virginia Company-doubtless with some  reference back to the King and Privy Council--De La Warr, Gates, the  deputy governor, and Dale, the High Marshal, appear to have been of  one mind as to these French settlements. Up north there was still  Virginia--in effect, England! Hands off, therefore, all European peoples  speaking with an un-English tongue!    Now it happened about this time that Captain Samuel Argall received a  commission \"to go fishing,\" and that he fished off that coast that is  now the coast of Maine, and brought his ship to anchor by Mount Desert.  Argall, a swift and high-handed person, fished on dry land. He swept  into his net the Jesuits on Mount Desert, set half of them in an open  boat to meet with what ship they might, and brought the other half  captive to Jamestown. Later, he appeared before Port Royal, where  he burned the cabins, slew the cattle, and drove into the forest the  settler Frenchmen. But Port Royal and the land about it called Acadia,  though much hurt, survived Argall's fishing.*         * Argall, on his fishing trip, has been credited with       attacking not only the French in Acadia but the Dutch       traders on Manhattan. But there are grounds for doubt if he       did the latter.    There was also on Virginia in these days the shadow of Spain. In 1611  the English had found upon the beach near Point Comfort three Spaniards  from a Spanish caravel which, as the Englishmen had learned with alarm,  \"was fitted with a shallop necessarie and propper to discover freshetts,  rivers, and creekes.\" They took the three prisoner and applied for  instructions to Dale, who held them to be spies and clapped them into  prison at Point Comfort.    That Dale's suspicions were correct, is proved by a letter which the  King of Spain wrote in cipher to the Spanish Ambassador in London  ordering him to confer with the King as to the liberty of three  prisoners whom Englishmen in Virginia have captured. The three are \"the  Alcayde Don Diego de Molino, Ensign Marco Antonio Perez, and Francisco  Lembri an English pilot, who by my orders went to reconnoitre those  ports.\" Small wonder that Dale was apprehensive. \"What may be the  daunger of this unto us,\" he wrote home, \"who are here so few, so weake,  and unfortified,... I refer me to your owne honorable knowledg.\"    Months pass, and the English Ambassador to Spain writes from Madrid that  he \"is not hasty to advertise anything upon bare rumours, which hath  made me hitherto forbeare to write what I had generally heard of their  intents against Virginia, but now I have been... advertised that without  question they will speedily attempt against our plantation there. And  that it is a thing resolved of, that ye King of Spain must run  any hazard with England rather than permit ye English to settle  there....Whatsoever is attempted, I conceive will be from ye Havana.\"    Rumors fly back and forth. The next year 1613--the Ambassador writes  from Madrid: \"They have latelie had severall Consultations about our  Plantation in Virginia. The resolution is--That it must be removed, but  they thinke it fitt to suspend the execution of it,... for that they are  in hope that it will fall of itselfe.\"    The Spanish hope seemed, at this time, not at all without foundation.  Members of the Virginia Company had formed the Somers Islands Company  named for Somers the Admiral--and had planted a small colony in Bermuda  where the Sea Adventure had been wrecked. Here were fair, fertile  islands without Indians, and without the diseases that seemed to rise,  no man knew how, from the marshes along those lower reaches of the  great river James in Virginia. Young though it was, the new plantation  \"prospereth better than that of Virginia, and giveth greater  incouragement to prosecute yt.\" In England there arose, from some  concerned, the cry to Give up Virginia that has proved a project awry!  As Gates was once about to remove thence every living man, so truly  they might \"now removed to these more hopeful islands!\" The Spanish  Ambassador is found writing to the Spanish King: \"Thus they are here  discouraged... on account of the heavy expenses they have incurred, and  the disappointment, that there is no passage from there to the South  Sea... nor mines of gold or silver.\" This, be it noted, was before  tobacco was discovered to be an economic treasure.    The Elizabeth from London reached Virginia in May, 1613. It brought to  the colony news of Bermuda, and incidentally of that new notion brewing  in the mind of some of the Company. When the Elizabeth, after a month in  Virginia, turned homeward, she carried a vigorous letter from Dale, the  High Marshal, to Sir Thomas Smith, Treasurer of the Company.    \"Let me tell you all at home [writes Dale] this one thing, and I pray  remember it; if you give over this country and loose it, you, with your  wisdoms, will leap such a gudgeon as our state hath not done the like  since they lost the Kingdom of France; be not gulled with the clamorous  report of base people; believe Caleb and Joshua; if the glory of God  have no power with them and the conversion of these poor infidels, yet  let the rich mammons' desire egge them on to inhabit these countries.  I protest to you, by the faith of an honest man, the more I range the  country the more I admire it. I have seen the best countries in Europe;  I protest to you, before the Living God, put them all together, this  country will be equivalent unto them if it be inhabited with good  people.\"    If ever Mother England seriously thought of moving Virginia into  Bermuda, the idea was now given over. Spain, suspending the sword until  Virginia \"will fall of itselfe,\" saw that sword rust away.    Five years in all Dale ruled Virginia. Then, personal and family matters  calling, he sailed away home to England, to return no more. Soon his  star \"having shined in the Westerne, was set in the Easterne India.\" At  the helm in Virginia he left George Yeardley, an honest, able man. But  in England, what was known as the \"court party\" in the Company managed  to have chosen instead for De La Warr's deputy governor, Captain Samuel  Argall. It proved an unfortunate choice. Argall, a capable and daring  buccaneer, fastened on Virginia as on a Spanish galleon. For a year  he ruled in his own interest, plundering and terrorizing. At last the  outcry against him grew so loud that it had to be listened to across the  Atlantic. Lord De La Warr was sent out in person to deal with matters  but died on the way; and Captain Yeardley, now knighted and appointed  Governor, was instructed to proceed against the incorrigible Argall. But  Argall had already departed to face his accusers in England.        CHAPTER VII. YOUNG VIRGINIA    The choice of Sir Edwyn Sandys as Treasurer of the Virginia Company in  1619 marks a turning-point in the history of both Company and colony. At  a moment when James I was aiming at absolute monarchy and was menacing  Parliament, Sandys and his party--the Liberals of the day--turned the  sessions of the Company into a parliament where momentous questions of  state and colonial policy were freely debated. The liberal spirit of  Sandys cast a beam of light, too, across the Atlantic. When Governor  Yeardley stepped ashore at Jamestown in mid-April, he brought with him,  as the first fruits of the new regime, no less a boon than the grant of  a representative assembly.    There were to be in Virginia, subject to the Company, subject in its  turn to the Crown, two \"Supreme Councils,\" one of which was to consist  of the Governor and his councilors chosen by the Company in England.  The other was to be elected by the colonists, two representatives or  burgesses from each distinct settlement. Council and House of Burgesses  were to constitute the upper and lower houses of the General Assembly.  The whole had power to legislate upon Virginian affairs within the  bounds of the colony, but the Governor in Virginia and the Company in  England must approve its acts.    A mighty hope in small was here! Hedged about with provisions, curtailed  and limited, here nevertheless was an acorn out of which, by natural  growth and some mutation, was to come popular government wide and deep.  The planting of this small seed of freedom here, in 1619, upon the banks  of the James in Virginia, is an event of prime importance.    On the 30th of July, 1619, there was convened in the log church in  Jamestown the first true Parliament or Legislative Assembly in America.  Twenty-two burgesses sat, hat on head, in the body of the church, with  the Governor and the Council in the best seats. Master John Pory, the  speaker, faced the Assembly; clerk and sergeant-at-arms were at hand;  Master Buck, the Jamestown "]]]
