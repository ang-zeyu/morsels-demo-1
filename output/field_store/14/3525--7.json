(#11)"],[1,"good of whole epochs.--In itself it is not  impossible that there are still remains of stronger natures, typical  unadapted men, somewhere in Europe: from this quarter the advent of a  somewhat belated form of beauty and perfection, even in music, might still  be hoped for. But the most that we can expect to see are exceptional  cases. From the rule, that corruption is paramount, that corruption is a  fatality,--not even a God can save music.          Epilogue      And now let us take breath and withdraw a moment from this narrow world  which necessarily must be narrow, because we have to make enquiries  relative to the value of _persons_. A philosopher feels that he wants to  wash his hands after he has concerned himself so long with the \"Case of  Wagner\". I shall now give my notion of what is _modern_. According to the  measure of energy of every age, there is also a standard that determines  which virtues shall be allowed and which forbidden. The age either has the  virtues of _ascending_ life, in which case it resists the virtues of  degeneration with all its deepest instincts. Or it is in itself an age of  degeneration, in which case it requires the virtues of declining life,--in  which case it hates everything that justifies itself, solely as being the  outcome of a plenitude, or a superabundance of strength. AEsthetic is  inextricably bound up with these biological principles: there is decadent  aesthetic, and _classical_ aesthetic,--\"beauty in itself\" is just as much a  chimera as any other kind of idealism.--Within the narrow sphere of the  so-called moral values, no greater antithesis could be found than that of  _master-morality_ and the morality of _Christian_ valuations: the latter  having grown out of a thoroughly morbid soil. (--The gospels present us  with the same physiological types, as do the novels of Dostoiewsky), the  master-morality (\"Roman,\" \"pagan,\" \"classical,\" \"Renaissance\"), on the  other hand, being the symbolic speech of well-constitutedness, of  _ascending_ life, and of the Will to Power as a vital principle.  Master-morality _affirms_ just as instinctively as Christian morality  _denies_ (\"God,\" \"Beyond,\" \"self-denial,\"--all of them negations). The  first reflects its plenitude upon things,--it transfigures, it embellishes,  it _rationalises_ the world,--the latter impoverishes, bleaches, mars the  value of things; it _suppresses_ the world. \"World\" is a Christian term of  abuse. These antithetical forms in the optics of values, are _both_  necessary: they are different points of view which cannot be circumvented  either with arguments or counter-arguments. One cannot refute  Christianity: it is impossible to refute a diseased eyesight. That people  should have combated pessimism as if it had been a philosophy, was the  very acme of learned stupidity. The concepts \"true\" and \"untrue\" do not  seem to me to have any sense in optics.--That, alone, which has to be  guarded against is the falsity, the instinctive duplicity which _would  fain_ regard this antithesis as no antithesis at all: just as Wagner  did,--and his mastery in this kind of falseness was of no mean order. To  cast side-long glances at master-morality, at _noble_ morality (--Icelandic  saga is perhaps the greatest documentary evidence of these values), and at  the same time to have the opposite teaching, the \"gospel of the lowly,\"  the doctrine of the _need_ of salvation, on one's lips!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Incidentally, I  admire the modesty of Christians who go to Bayreuth. As for myself, I  could _not_ endure to hear the sound of certain words on Wagner's lips.  There are some concepts which are too good for Bayreuth {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} What?  Christianity adjusted for female Wagnerites, perhaps _by_ female  Wagnerites--for, in his latter days Wagner was thoroughly _feminini  generis_--? Again I say, the Christians of to-day are too modest for me.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}  If Wagner were a Christian, then Liszt was perhaps a Father of the  Church!--The need of _salvation_, the quintessence of all Christian needs,  has nothing in common with such clowns; it is the most straightforward  expression of decadence, it is the most convincing and most painful  affirmation of decadence, in sublime symbols and practices. The Christian  wishes _to be rid_ of himself. _Le moi est toujours haissable._ Noble  morality, master-morality, on the other hand, is rooted in a triumphant  saying of yea to _one's self_,--it is the self-affirmation and  self-glorification of life; it also requires sublime symbols and  practices; but only \"because its heart is too full.\" The whole of  beautiful art and of great art belongs here; their common essence is  gratitude. But we must allow it a certain instinctive repugnance _to  decadents_, and a scorn and horror of the latter's symbolism: such things  almost prove it. The noble Romans considered Christianity as a _foeda  superstitio_: let me call to your minds the feelings which the last German  of noble taste--Goethe--had in regard to the cross. It is idle to look for  more valuable, more _necessary_ contrasts.(14)    But the kind of falsity which is characteristic of the Bayreuthians is not  exceptional to-day. We all know the hybrid concept of the Christian  gentleman. This _innocence_ in contradiction, this \"clean conscience\" in  falsehood, is rather modern _par excellence_, with it modernity is almost  defined. Biologically, modern man represents a _contradiction of values_,  he sits between two stools, he says yea and nay in one breath. No wonder  that it is precisely in our age that falseness itself became flesh and  blood, and even genius! No wonder _Wagner_ dwelt amongst us! It was not  without reason that I called Wagner the Cagliostro of modernity.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But all  of us, though we do not know it, involuntarily have values, words,  formulae, and morals in our bodies, which are quite _antagonistic_ in their  origin--regarded from a physiological standpoint, we are _false_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} How  would a _diagnosis of the modern soul_ begin? With a determined incision  into this agglomeration of contradictory instincts, with the total  suppression of its antagonistic values, with vivisection applied to its  most _instructive_ case. To philosophers the \"Case of Wagner\" is a  _windfall_--this essay, as you observe, was inspired by gratitude.            NIETZSCHE _CONTRA_ WAGNER      THE BRIEF OF A PSYCHOLOGIST          Preface      The following chapters have been selected from past works of mine, and not  without care. Some of them date back as far as 1877. Here and there, of  course, they will be found to have been made a little more intelligible,  but above all, more brief. Read consecutively, they can leave no one in  any doubt, either concerning myself, or concerning Wagner: we are  antipodes. The reader will come to other conclusions, too, in his perusal  of these pages: for instance, that this is an essay for psychologists and  _not_ for Germans.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} I have my readers everywhere, in Vienna, St  Petersburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Paris, and New York--but _I have none_  in Europe's Flat-land--Germany.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And I might even have something to say to  Italians whom I love just as much as I {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} _Quousque tandem, Crispi_ {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}  Triple alliance: a people can only conclude a _mesalliance_ with the  \"Empire.\"{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    Friedrich Nietzsche.    Turin, _Christmas 1888_.          Wherein I Admire Wagner.      I believe that artists very often do not know what they are best able to  do. They are much too vain. Their minds are directed to something prouder  than merely to appear like little plants, which, with freshness, rareness,  and beauty, know how to sprout from their soil with real perfection. The  ultimate goodness of their own garden and vineyard is superciliously  under-estimated by them, and their love and their insight are not of the  same quality. Here is a musician who is a greater master than anyone else  in the discovering of tones, peculiar to suffering, oppressed, and  tormented souls, who can endow even dumb misery with speech. Nobody can  approach him in the colours of late autumn, in the indescribably touching  joy of a last, a very last, and all too short gladness; he knows of a  chord which expresses those secret and weird midnight hours of the soul,  when cause and effect seem to have fallen asunder, and at every moment  something may spring out of nonentity. He is happiest of all when creating  from out the nethermost depths of human happiness, and, so to speak, from  out man's empty bumper, in which the bitterest and most repulsive drops  have mingled with the sweetest for good or evil at last. He knows that  weary shuffling along of the soul which is no longer able either to spring  or to fly, nay, which is no longer able to walk, he has the modest glance  of concealed suffering, of understanding without comfort, of leave-taking  without word or sign; verily as the Orpheus of all secret misery he is  greater than anyone, and many a thing was introduced into art for the  first time by him, which hitherto had not been given expression, had not  even been thought worthy of art--the cynical revolts, for instance, of  which only the greatest sufferer is capable, also many a small and quite  microscopical feature of the soul, as it were the scales of its amphibious  nature--yes indeed, he is the master of everything very small. But this he  refuses to be! His tastes are much more in love with vast walls and with  daring frescoes!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} He does not see that his spirit has another desire and  bent--a totally different outlook--that it prefers to squat peacefully in  the corners of broken-down houses: concealed in this way, and hidden even  from himself, he paints his really great masterpieces, all of which are  very short, often only one bar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25016"],[0,"The House of Souls (#11)"],[1,"the old pictures; they were  shining like silver, and they filled the air with their sweet scent. It  was from near that house I saw the valley and high places far away in  the sun. So, as I say, I went \"on and on,\" by woods and fields, till I  came to a little town on the top of a hill, a town full of old houses  bowing to the ground beneath their years, and the morning was so still  that the blue smoke rose up straight into the sky from all the  roof-tops, so still that I heard far down in the valley the song of a  boy who was singing an old song through the streets as he went to  school, and as I passed through the awakening town, beneath the old,  grave houses, the church bells began to ring.    'It was soon after I had left this town behind me that I found the  Strange Road. I saw it branching off from the dusty high road, and it  looked so green that I turned aside into it, and soon I felt as if I had  really come into a new country. I don't know whether it was one of the  roads the old Romans made that my father used to tell me about; but it  was covered with deep, soft turf, and the great tall hedges on each side  looked as if they had not been touched for a hundred years; they had  grown so broad and high and wild that they met overhead, and I could  only get glimpses here and there of the country through which I was  passing, as one passes in a dream. The Strange Road led me on and on,  up and down hill; sometimes the rose bushes had grown so thick that I  could scarcely make my way between them, and sometimes the road  broadened out into a green, and in one valley a brook, spanned by an old  wooden bridge, ran across it. I was tired, and I found a soft and shady  place beneath an ash tree, where I must have slept for many hours, for  when I woke up it was late in the afternoon. So I went on again, and at  last the green road came out into the highway, and I looked up and saw  another town on a high place with a great church in the middle of it,  and when I went up to it there was a great organ sounding from within,  and the choir was singing.'    There was a rapture in Darnell's voice as he spoke, that made his story  well-nigh swell into a song, and he drew a long breath as the words  ended, filled with the thought of that far-off summer day, when some  enchantment had informed all common things, transmuting them into a  great sacrament, causing earthly works to glow with the fire and the  glory of the everlasting light.    And some splendour of that light shone on the face of Mary as she sat  still against the sweet gloom of the night, her dark hair making her  face more radiant. She was silent for a little while, and then she  spoke--    'Oh, my dear, why have you waited so long to tell me these wonderful  things? I think it is beautiful. Please go on.'    'I have always been afraid it was all nonsense,' said Darnell. 'And I  don't know how to explain what I feel. I didn't think I could say so  much as I have to-night.'    'And did you find it the same day after day?'    'All through the tour? Yes, I think every journey was a success. Of  course, I didn't go so far afield every day; I was too tired. Often I  rested all day long, and went out in the evening, after the lamps were  lit, and then only for a mile or two. I would roam about old, dim  squares, and hear the wind from the hills whispering in the trees; and  when I knew I was within call of some great glittering street, I was  sunk in the silence of ways where I was almost the only passenger, and  the lamps were so few and faint that they seemed to give out shadows  instead of light. And I would walk slowly, to and fro, perhaps for an  hour at a time, in such dark streets, and all the time I felt what I  told you about its being my secret--that the shadow, and the dim lights,  and the cool of the evening, and trees that were like dark low clouds  were all mine, and mine alone, that I was living in a world that nobody  else knew of, into which no one could enter.    'I remembered one night I had gone farther. It was somewhere in the far  west, where there are orchards and gardens, and great broad lawns that  slope down to trees by the river. A great red moon rose that night  through mists of sunset, and thin, filmy clouds, and I wandered by a  road that passed through the orchards, till I came to a little hill,  with the moon showing above it glowing like a great rose. Then I saw  figures pass between me and the moon, one by one, in a long line, each  bent double, with great packs upon their shoulders. One of them was  singing, and then in the middle of the song I heard a horrible shrill  laugh, in the thin cracked voice of a very old woman, and they  disappeared into the shadow of the trees. I suppose they were people  going to work, or coming from work in the gardens; but how like it was  to a nightmare!    'I can't tell you about Hampton; I should never finish talking. I was  there one evening, not long before they closed the gates, and there were  very few people about. But the grey-red, silent, echoing courts, and the  flowers falling into dreamland as the night came on, and the dark yews  and shadowy-looking statues, and the far, still stretches of water  beneath the avenues; and all melting into a blue mist, all being hidden  from one's eyes, slowly, surely, as if veils were dropped, one by one,  on a great ceremony! Oh! my dear, what could it mean? Far away, across  the river, I heard a soft bell ring three times, and three times, and  again three times, and I turned away, and my eyes were full of tears.    'I didn't know what it was when I came to it; I only found out  afterwards that it must have been Hampton Court. One of the men in the  office told me he had taken an A. B. C. girl there, and they had great  fun. They got into the maze and couldn't get out again, and then they  went on the river and were nearly drowned. He told me there were some  spicy pictures in the galleries; his girl shrieked with laughter, so he  said.'    Mary quite disregarded this interlude.    'But you told me you had made a map. What was it like?'    'I'll show it you some day, if you want to see it. I marked down all the  places I had gone to, and made signs--things like queer letters--to  remind me of what I had seen. Nobody but myself could understand it. I  wanted to draw pictures, but I never learnt how to draw, so when I tried  nothing was like what I wanted it to be. I tried to draw a picture of  that town on the hill that I came to on the evening of the first day; I  wanted to make a steep hill with houses on top, and in the middle, but  high above them, the great church, all spires and pinnacles, and above  it, in the air, a cup with rays coming from it. But it wasn't a success.  I made a very strange sign for Hampton Court, and gave it a name that I  made up out of my head.'    The Darnells avoided one another's eyes as they sat at breakfast the  next morning. The air had lightened in the night, for rain had fallen at  dawn; and there was a bright blue sky, with vast white clouds rolling  across it from the south-west, and a fresh and joyous wind blew in at  the open window; the mists had vanished. And with the mists there seemed  to have vanished also the sense of strange things that had possessed  Mary and her husband the night before; and as they looked out into the  clear light they could scarcely believe that the one had spoken and the  other had listened a few hours before to histories very far removed from  the usual current of their thoughts and of their lives. They glanced  shyly at one another, and spoke of common things, of the question  whether Alice would be corrupted by the insidious Mrs. Murry, or whether  Mrs. Darnell would be able to persuade the girl that the old woman must  be actuated by the worst motives.    'And I think, if I were you,' said Darnell, as he went out, 'I should  step over to the stores and complain of their meat. That last piece of  beef was very far from being up to the mark--full of sinew.'      III    It might have been different in the evening, and Darnell had matured a  plan by which he hoped to gain much. He intended to ask his wife if she  would mind having only one gas, and that a good deal lowered, on the  pretext that his eyes were tired with work; he thought many things might  happen if the room were dimly lit, and the window opened, so that they  could sit and watch the night, and listen to the rustling murmur of the  tree on the lawn. But his plans were made in vain, for when he got to  the garden gate his wife, in tears, came forth to meet him.    'Oh, Edward,' she began, 'such a dreadful thing has happened! I never  liked him much, but I didn't think he would ever do such awful things.'    'What do you mean? Who are you talking about? What has happened? Is it  Alice's young man?'    'No, no. But come in, dear. I can see that woman opposite watching us:  she's always on the look out.'    'Now, what is it?' said Darnell, as they sat down to tea. 'Tell me,  quick! you've quite frightened me.'    'I don't know how to begin, or where to start. Aunt Marian has thought  that there was something queer for weeks. And then she found--oh, well,  the long and short of it is that Uncle Robert has been carrying on  dreadfully with some horrid girl, and aunt has found out everything!'    'Lord! you don't say so! The old rascal! Why, he must be nearer seventy  than sixty!'    'He's just sixty-five; and the money he has given her----'    The first shock of surprise over, Darnell turned resolutely to his  mince.    'We'll have it all out after tea,' he said; 'I am not going to have my  meals spoilt by that old fool of a Nixon. Fill up my cup, will you,  dear?'    'Excellent mince this,' he went on, calmly. 'A little lemon juice and a  bit of ham in it? I thought there was something extra. Alice all right  to-day? That's good. I expect she's getting over all that nonsense.'    He went on calmly chattering "]]]
