[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27867"],[0,"Scientific American magazine, Vol. 2 Issue 1 (#11)"],[1,"articles, the  whole number abounds with school-boy violations of the English  language. Redundancy and the want of appropriateness in the use of  words are the most common errors. Circumlocution and want of precision  are common; and in many sentences all these and other violations  occur, rendering it almost impossible to guess at the meaning.  Independent of \"_inflexibly_ in advance\" on the cover, the first  sentence in the announcement on the first page is an instance of  ambiguity and careless construction. In the first article, on the same  page, are several sentences indicating the same carelessness. The  article describing Hoe's cylinder press is a collection of  badly-constructed sentences. If your limits permitted I would give a  whole column of illustrations. The following sentences have so many  faults I cannot Italicise. They may serve to exercise your juvenile  readers.    \"We intend to pursue the publication of the list hereafter, future and  past; that is in our next number will appear those of August 20, and  follow for one month; also the list for one month prior to the 21st of  June.\"    \"A material or composition, of a very cheap character, has been  invented, and hard, strong and compact as flint.\" \"From this, streets  of any grade may be formed, and in such a way as to entirely to secure  a permanent and level surface to its proper grade and arch\".    Three fourths of the sentences forming the article on Dr. Lewis'  Railroad are very faulty.    \"Hutching's Propeller. It consists of forming a set of oars, and by  cams upon themselves, and a foundation-plate with cams to match, cause  the oars to revolve of themselves, when the main wheel, composed of  these oars, revolves.\"    \"A patent is pending for the invention of a wheel, in which Mr. Wm.  Hulme, of Paterson, N. J, has made an invention.\"    \"Russ's Pavement, There is no doubt it will make a good road in  comparison with our present streets, as far as surface goes; but we  must confess our incredulity of the entire success of this plan. We do  not like the ideal method of getting at the water-pipes, &c. of the  city.\"    The Report on Rider's Iron Bridge is by another and different pen. I  will pass by \"_protracted_ from beneath upwards,\" &c., and give a few  more quotations.    \"Inventors scarcely ever receive the compensation due their however  distinguished merit, either pecuniary or laudatory. The originators or  first conceivers of the most momentous plans of utility and comfort  are oftenest the most grossly neglected and overlooked.\"    \"Shortly after these details reached the U. States, by Professor S. F.  B. Morse, of New York, who was at the time of the discovery residing  in Paris.\"    \"This committee give their services for the promotion of good to the  cause of Invention and Science, without any consideration other than  this.\"    \"Almost all other branches of knowledge have their magazines and  journals, and other means of diffusing information, so that in their  departments hardly a desideratum is left to be supplied; while the  Inventor, as such, has almost no channel through which he may  legitimately appear before the public.\" \"An editorial committee was  accordingly appointed for the supervision of this department, and to  whose inspection all matter of the journal, previous to publication,  will be submitted.\"    All the previous articles have been descriptive. We now come to our  argumentative, on Novelty in Inventions. The reasoning powers of the  writer may be learned from the following:    \"Thus we conclude that the _novelty_ of _an invention_ consists in  making something 'useful to society,' and that in an original and  novel way, so as to embody the great principle of invention.\" Or, as  far as the writer has informed us, the novelty is the useful, the  useful is the original and novel, and the original and novel are the  great principle, and the great principle is the novelty or something  else.    \"We offer an explanation, not an apology for the want of a more full  variety of scientific matter.\"    \"Fisher's Magazine publishes a complete list, comprising the Railroads  of the U. States, as far as they are completed, and as far as  particulars are known.\"    \"The French government has patronized an exploration of the island of  Cyprus, for the purpose of exploring its architectural remains.\"    Under the head of \"Editors' Table,\" I subjoin the principal and most  important sentence:    \"In this department we have but little room, and in this case it is,  perhaps, well we have little, as it is seldom much in the way of  articles for notice, are placed before an editorial corps before the  appearance of the first number.\"    With the exception of three or four articles, the whole number is  discreditable to The National Association of Inventors. A second  number should not appear until the editors have had the benefit of at  least one term in the preparatory school of Columbia College.

When dropping her egg upon the honey, therefore, the Anthophora at the  same time deposits in her cell the mortal enemy of her race; she  carefully plasters the lid which closes the entrance to the cell; and  all is done. A second cell is built beside it, probably to suffer the  same fatal doom; and so on until the more or less numerous parasites  sheltered by her down are all accommodated. Let us leave the unhappy  mother to continue her fruitless task and turn our attention to the  young larva which has so adroitly secured itself board and lodging.    In opening cells whose lid is still moist, we end by discovering one  in which the egg, recently laid, supports a young Sitaris. This egg is  intact and in irreproachable condition. But now the work of  devastation begins: the larva, a tiny black speck which we see running  over the white surface of the egg, at last stops and balances itself  firmly on its six legs; then, seizing the delicate skin of the egg  with the sharp hooks of its mandibles, it tugs at it violently until  it breaks, spilling its contents, which the larva eagerly drinks up.  Thus the first stroke of the mandibles which the parasite delivers in  the usurped cell is aimed at the destruction of the Bee's egg. A  highly logical precaution! The Sitaris-larva, as we shall see, has to  feed upon the honey in the cell; the Anthophora-larva which would  proceed from that egg would require the same food; but the portion is  too small for two; so, quick, a bite at the egg and the difficulty  will be removed. The story of these facts calls for no comment. This  destruction of the cumbersome egg is all the more inevitable inasmuch  as special tastes compel the young Sitaris-grub to make its first  meals of it. Indeed we see the tiny creature begin by greedily  drinking the juices which the torn wrapper of the egg allows to  escape; and for several days it may be observed, at one time  motionless on this envelope, in which it rummages at intervals with  its head, at others running over it from end to end to rip it open  still wider and to cause a little of the juices, which become daily  less abundant, to trickle from it; but we never catch it imbibing the  honey which surrounds it on every side.    For that matter, it is easy to convince ourselves that the egg  combines with the function of a life-buoy that of the first ration. I  have laid on the surface of the honey in a cell a tiny strip of paper,  of the same dimensions as the egg; and on this raft I have placed a  Sitaris-larva. Despite every care, my attempts, many times repeated,  always failed. The larva, placed in a paper boat in the centre of the  mass of honey, behaves as in the earlier experiments. Not finding what  suits it, it tries to escape and perishes in the sticky toils as soon  as it leaves the strip of paper, which it soon does.    On the other hand, we can easily rear Sitaris-grubs by taking  Anthophora-cells not invaded by the parasites, cells in which the egg  is not yet hatched. All that we have to do is to pick up one of these  grubs with the moistened tip of a needle and to lay it delicately on  the egg. There is then no longer the least attempt to escape. After  exploring the egg to find its way about, the larva rips it open and  for several days does not stir from the spot. Henceforth its  development takes place unhindered, provided that the cell be  protected from too rapid evaporation, which would dry up the honey and  render it unfit for the grub's food. The Anthophora's egg therefore is  absolutely necessary to the Sitaris-larva, not merely as a boat, but  also as its first nourishment. This is the whole secret, for lack of  knowing which I had hitherto failed in my attempts to rear the larvae  hatched in my glass jars.    At the end of a week, the egg, drained by the parasite, is nothing but  a dry skin. The first meal is finished. The Sitaris-larva, whose  dimensions have almost doubled, now splits open along the back; and  through a slit which comprises the head and the three thoracic  segments a white corpusculum, the second form of this singular  organism, escapes to fall on the surface of the honey, while the  abandoned slough remains clinging to the raft which has hitherto  safeguarded and fed the larva. Presently both sloughs, those of the  Sitaris and the egg, will disappear, submerged under the waves of  honey which the new larva is about to raise. Here ends the history of  the first form adopted by the Sitaris.    In summing up the above, we see that the strange little creature  awaits, without food, for seven months, the appearance of the  Anthophorae and at last fastens on to the hairs on the corselet of the  males, who are the first to emerge and who inevitably pass within its  reach in going through their corridors. From the fleece of the male  the larva moves, three or four weeks later, to that of the female, at  the moment of coupling; and then from the female to the egg leaving  the oviduct. It is by this concatenation of complex manoeuvres that  the larva in the end finds itself perched upon an egg in the middle of  a closed cell filled with honey. These perilous gymnastics on the hair  of a Bee in movement all the day, this passing from one sex to the  other, this arrival in the middle of the cell by way of the egg, a  dangerous bridge thrown across the sticky abyss, all this necessitates  the balancing-appliances with which it is provided and which I have  described above. Lastly, the destruction of the egg calls, in its  turn, for a sharp pair of scissors; and such is the object of the  keen, curved mandibles. Thus the primary form of the Sitares has as  its function to get itself carried by the Anthophora into the cell and  to rip up her egg. This done, the organism becomes transformed to such  a degree that repeated observations are required to make us believe  the evidence of our eyes.          CHAPTER IV  THE PRIMARY LARVA OF THE OIL-BEETLES      I interrupt the history of the Sitares to speak of the Meloes, those  uncouth Beetles, with their clumsy belly and their limp wing-cases  yawning over their back like the tails of a fat man's coat that is far  too tight for its wearer. The insect is ugly in colouring, which is  black, with an occasional blue gleam, and uglier still in shape and  gait; and its disgusting method of defence increases the repugnance  with which it inspires us. If it judges itself to be in danger, the  Meloe resorts to spontaneous bleeding. From its joints a yellowish,  oily fluid oozes, which stains your fingers and makes them stink. This  is the creature's blood. The English, because of its trick of  discharging oily blood when on the defensive, call this insect the  Oil-beetle. It would not be a particularly interesting Beetle save for  its metamorphoses and the peregrinations of its larva, which are  similar in every respect to those of the larva of the Sitares. In  their first form, the Oil-beetles are parasites of the Anthophorae;  their tiny grub, when it leaves the egg, has itself carried into the  cell by the Bee whose victuals are to form its food.    Observed in the down of various Bees, the queer little creature for a  long time baffled the sagacity of the naturalists, who, mistaking its  true origin, made it a species of a special family of wingless  insects. It was the Bee-louse (_Pediculus apis_) of Linnaeus;[1] the  Triungulin of the Andrenae (_Triungulinus andrenetarum_) of Leon  Dufour. They saw in it a parasite, a sort of Louse, living in the  fleece of the honey-gatherers. It was reserved for the distinguished  English naturalist Newport to show that this supposed Louse was the  first state of the Oil-beetles. Some observations of my own will fill  a few lacunae in the English scientist's monograph. I will therefore  sketch the evolution of the Oil-beetles, using Newport's work where my  own observations are defective. In this way the Sitares and the  Meloes, alike in habits and transformations, will be compared; and the  comparison will throw a certain light upon the strange metamorphoses  of these insects.    [Footnote 1: Carolus Linnaeus (Karl von Linne, 1707-1778), the  celebrated Swedish botanist and naturalist, founder of the Linnaean  system of classification.--_Translator's Note_.]    The same Mason-bee (_Anthophora pilipes_) upon whom the Sitares live  also feeds a few scarce Meloes (_M. cicatricosus_) in its cells. A  second Anthophora of my district (_A. parietina_) is more subject to  this parasite's invasions. It was also in the nests of an Anthophora,  but of a different species (_A. retusa_), that Newport observed the  same Oil-beetle. These three lodgings adopted by _Meloe cicatricosus_  may be of some slight interest, as leading us to suspect that each  species of Meloe is apparently the parasite of diverse Bees, a  suspicion which will be confirmed when we examine the manner in which  the larvae reach the cell full of honey. The Sitares, though less  given to change of lodging, are likewise able to inhabit nests of  different species. They are very common in the cells of _Anthophora  pilipes_; but I have found them also, in very small numbers, it is  true, in the cells of _A. personata_.    Despite the presence of _Meloe cicatricosus_ in the dwellings of the  Mason-bee, which I so often ransacked in compiling the history of the  Sitares, I never saw this insect, at any season of the year, wandering  on the perpendicular soil, at the entrance of the corridors, for the  purpose of laying its eggs there, as the Sitares do; and I should know  nothing of the details of the egg-laying if Godart,[2] de Geer[3] and,  above all, Newport had not informed us that the Oil-beetles lay their  eggs in the earth. According to the last-named author, the various  Oil-beetles whom he had the opportunity of observing dig, among the  roots of a clump of grass, in a dry soil exposed to the sun, a"]]]
