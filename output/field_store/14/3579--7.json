Tourism's direct contribution to output in    1994 was about 20%. In addition, increased tourist arrivals helped    spur growth in the construction and transport sectors. The dual    island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the    domestic market; the sector is constrained by the limited water    supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in    tourism and construction. Manufacturing - which accounts for 3.5% of    GDP - comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products    being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for    economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income    growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which    accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.
