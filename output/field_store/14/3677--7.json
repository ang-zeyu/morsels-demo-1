I saw this migrant at Semporna on August 19, 1962; soon it was the       most common swallow at each of the localities where seen.    _=Cecropsia striolata striolata=_ Temminck and Schlegel: Striated  Swallow.--While in Kalabakan on November 3, 1962, I saw a swallow that  differed markedly from others in town. I could not see the breast, but  the rump was conspicuously tawny, clearly indicating that the bird  belonged to this species. There are but two specimens from Borneo, both  from southwestern Sarawak (Smythies, 1960:353). D. M. Batchelor records  the species from Kimanis Bay but gives no dates other than  November-December (Smythies, 1963:280). Batchelor's observation and mine  provide the first records for North Borneo.    _=Dicrurus aeneus malayensis=_ (Blyth): Bronzed Drongo.--_Specimen_, 1:  12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 20, 1962, MCT 3104.         This drongo was seen only once, when a flock of three to five was       feeding late one evening in a clearing where the trees had been cut       down the day before.    _=Dicrurus paradiseus brachyphorus=_ (Bonaparte): Large Racket-tailed  Drongo.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] immature, 58.2  gm., August 4, 1962, MCT 2727; [Female], 65.1 gm., August 20, 1962, MCT  2786; [Male], December 1, 1962, MCT 3413. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female],  October 20, 1962, MCT 3102. Kalabakan: [Male], November 18, 1962, MCT  3303.         I seldom saw this species in the cocoa at Quoin Hill. Twelve miles       north of Kalabakan it was common in tree tops 150 feet up, foraging       in the upper canopy.    _=Oriolus xanthonotus consobrinus=_ Ramsay: Malaysian Black-headed  Oriole.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] imm., 41.8 gm.,  July 22, 1962, MCT 2639; [Female], 40.7 gm., July 23, 1962, MCT 2644;  [Male] testis 1 x 1 mm., 48.2 gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2653; [Female]  imm., 36.3 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2681; [Male] imm., 40.4 gm., August  25, 1962, MCT 2804; [Male], September 26, 1962; MCT 2962; [Male],  November 29, 1962, MCT 3381; [Female], December 2, 1962, MCT 3426. 12  mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], October 28, 1962, MCT 3180.         This oriole was common in the cocoa and in secondary forest       surrounding the cocoa at Quoin Hill.    _=Platylophus galericulatus coronatus=_ (Raffles): Crested  Jay.--_Specimens_, 4: 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 17, 1962,  MCT 3068; [Female], October 21, 1962, MCT 3116; [Male], October 21,  1962, MCT 3117; [Male], October 21, 1962, MCT 3118.         This jay was observed several times at the forest camp at       Kalabakan. The bird utters a metallic chattering noise much like       that of other jays, except for the metallic quality. I observed it       also in moss forest 5.5 miles north of Tenom.         Comparison of my specimens with series in the U. S. National Museum       and the American Museum of Natural History indicates wide variation       within this species in Borneo. The specimens vary considerably in       depth of brown, some approaching _P. g. lemprieri_ and others _P.       g. coronatus_. Because of this wide variation I have not recognized       the subspecies _lemprieri_ and place all specimens from Borneo       under _coronatus_.    _=Platysmurus leucopterus aterrimus=_ (Temminck): Black Crested  Magpie.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] brood patch  refeathering, 181.6 gm., July 21, 1962, MCT 2628; [Female] imm., 143.4  gm., July 21, 1962, MCT 2629; [Female], September 4, 1962, MCT 2865;  [Male], 178.0 gm., September 6, 1962, MCT 2880.         The Black Crested Magpie was common at Quoin Hill in secondary       forest and cocoa. At the Kalabakan forest camp, I saw a flock of 10       to 20 feeding 70 to 100 feet up in a tree in primary forest.    _=Corvus enca compilator=_ Richmond: Slender-billed Crow.--_Specimen_,  1: Pintasan Agricultural Station: [Female], October 17, 1963, ADG 315.         Small flocks in the cocoa and secondary forest were common at the       Cocoa Research Station.    _=Pityriasis gymnocephala=_ (Temminck): Bald-headed Wood  Shrike.--_Specimens_, 7: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] one testis,  115.0 gm., October 4, 1962, MCT 2987; [Female] largest ova 15 mm.,  well-developed brood patch, oviduct enlarged, 140.0 gm., October 4,  1962, MCT 2988; [Male] testis 8 x 5 mm., 121.0 gm., October 4, 1962, MCT  2989. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], November 8, 1962, MCT 3224; [Female],  November 8, 1962, MCT 3225; [Male], November 8, 1962, MCT 3226;  [Female], November 8, 1962, MCT 3227.         These birds first drew my attention at Quoin Hill by their peculiar       whistle, which Smythies (1960:491) calls a \"nasal whine.\" They seem       not to descend lower than 30 feet above the ground. They are       exceedingly tame; I shot at them two to four times without       frightening them off. They were in badly disturbed primary forest       at Quoin Hill. At a point 12 miles north of Kalabakan, I found them       in primary forest. I took four birds from a flock of five or six.       Later in the afternoon, I heard another group in the tops of trees       150 feet high. They seemed to be fairly common, judging by the       frequency with which the calls were heard. One of the birds I shot       was only wounded and set up such a clamor that soon the rest of the       flock approached, seemingly in response to the distress calls. Some       individuals came within 20 feet of me. The noise also attracted an       accipiter.         Some of the specimens were made into skeletons, which I think show       important indications of the systematic position of this species.       The Bald-headed Wood Shrike has been placed in various families.       Gadow (1883:90) placed it with the Cracticidae, with its closest       relative being _Cracticus_. Amadon (1956) thought that it was best       left in the Prionopidae, with subfamily status. Hachisuka (1953)       concluded that its closest affinities were with _Cracticus_ of the       family Cracticidae. The latest reviser, A. L. Rand (_in_ Peters _et       al._, 1960:364-365), places it in the Laniidae. A brief comparison       of my skeletons of _Pityriasis_ tended to confirm Gadow's and       Hachisuka's conclusion that it belongs with the Cracticidae. I       think that it is best placed in this family, with subfamily status       (Pityriasinae).    _=Sitta frontalis corallipes=_ (Sharpe): Velvet-fronted  Nuthatch.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm., 14.0  gm., July 23, 1962, MCT 2646; [Male] imm., 13.0 gm., August 20, 1963,  MCT 2780; [Male] imm., August 27, 1962, MCT 2820.         I saw several nuthatches feeding in secondary forest at Quoin Hill       and one 12 miles north of Kalabakan. One was observed feeding about       100 feet up in a dipterocarp.    _=Pellorneum capistratum morrelli=_ Chasen and Kloss. Black-capped  Jungle Babbler.--_Specimens_, 7: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 3  x 2 mm., 21.1 gm., July 27, 1962, MCT 2667; [Female], 21.4 gm., July 31,  1962, MCT 2690; [Male], September 24, 1962, MCT 2938; [Female], June 13,  1963, ADG 131; [Female] imm., June 14, 1963, ADG 140; [Female], July 7,  1963, ADG 168. Ulu Balung Cocoa Estate: [Female], July 11, 1963, ADG  188.         This species was seen 12 miles north of Kalabakan and at Quoin       Hill. It was fairly common and could be seen running on the ground       ahead of the observer, occasionally hopping up on a brush pile or       branch, seemingly to make a quick survey before moving back to the       ground. It preferred primary forest but was occasionally observed       in the primary-secondary forest edge vegetation.    _=Trichastoma pyrrhogenys canicapillum=_ (Sharpe): Temminck Jungle  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 13: 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Female], December 17,  1962, MCT 3445; [Male], December 17, 1962, MCT 3446; [Male], December  17, 1962, MCT 3452; [Male], December 18, 1962, MCT 34554; [Female]  collapsed follicles, brood patch, December 18, 1962, MCT 3455; [Male],  December 18, 1962, MCT 3460; [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm., December 18, 1962,  MCT 3461; [Male], December 19, 1962, MCT 3474; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm.,  December 19, 1962, MCT 3475; [Male], December 22, 1962, MCT 3505;  [Male], December 24, 1962, MCT 3528; [Female] imm., December 25, 1962,  MCT 3532; [Male] testis 5 x 3 mm., December 25, 1962, MCT 3533.         This species was common in the moss forest near Tenom. The female       specimen with collapsed follicles indicates that some of the birds       were in breeding condition. All specimens were netted.    _=Trichastoma malaccense poliogenys=_ (Strickland): Short-tailed Jungle  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 17: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 7 x 4  mm., 24.5 gm., July 31, 1962, MCT 2687; [Female], September 5, 1962, MCT  2874; [Female], September 24, 1962, MCT 2941; [Male], November 29, 1962,  MCT 3387; [Female], November 29, 1962, MCT 3388; [Male], December 1,  1962, MCT 3400; [Female], November 12, 1962, MCT 3262. Kalabakan:  [Male], November 16, 1962, MCT 3292. Cocoa Research Station: [Male],  June 11, 1963, ADG 123; [Male], June 12, 1963, ADG 127; [Female], June  13, 1963, ADG 132. Ulu Balung Cocoa Estate: [Male], July 9, 1963, ADG  179; [Male], July 9, 1963, ADG 179 (_sic_). Oil Palm Research Station:  [Male], August 10, 1963, ADG 219; [Male], August 12, 1963, ADG 225;  [Female], August 13, 1963, ADG 236; [Female], August 23, 1963, ADG 255.         This terrestrial species was common in primary forest, and       occasionally in secondary forest, in low trees or around brush       piles. On September 24, by \"squeaking,\" I so aroused one bird that       it ran back and forth on a limb of a fallen tree in great       agitation. The specimen taken on November 12 was in heavy molt; it       lacked tail feathers and the primaries were being replaced.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#11)"],[1," in the fields  or travelling in boats, chiefly as a protection against the rays of  the sun. The women wear also a large mushroom-shaped hat similar to  that worn by the men. With few exceptions all the women allow the hair  to grow uncut and to fall naturally from the ridge of the cranium,  confined only by a circular band of rattan or beadwork passing over  the occiput and just above the eyebrows.    The principal ornaments of the women are necklaces and girdles of  beads, earrings, and bracelets. A well-to-do Kayan woman may wear a  large number of valuable beads (see Pls. 28 and 31). The bracelets  are of ivory, and both forearms are sometimes completely sheathed  in series of such bracelets. The ear-rings are the most distinctive  feature of the Kayan woman's adornment. The perforated lobes of the  ears are gradually drawn down during childhood and youth, until  each lobe forms a slender loop which reaches to the collar-bone,  or lower. Each loop bears several massive rings of copper (Pl. 20),  whose combined weight is in some cases as much as two pounds.[35] Most  of the Kenyah women also wear similar earrings, but these are usually  lighter and more numerous, and the lobe is not so much distended. The  women of many of the Klemantan tribes wear a large wooden disc in the  distended lobe of each ear, and those of other Klemantan tribes wear  a smaller wooden plug with a boss (Pl. 32). The children run naked  up to the age of six or seven years, when they are dressed in the  fashion of their parents.    On festive occasions both men and women put on as many of their  ornaments as can be conveniently worn.      Deformation of the Head    Some of the Malanaus, a partially Mohammedan tribe of Klemantans,  seated about the mouths of the Muka, Oya, and Bintulu rivers of  Sarawak, have the curious custom of flattening the heads of the  infants, chiefly the females. The flattening is effected at an  early age, the process beginning generally within the first month  after birth. It consists in applying pressure to the head by means  of a simple apparatus for some fifteen minutes, more or less, on  successive days, or at rather longer intervals. The application of  the pressure for this brief space of time, on some ten to twenty  occasions, seems to suffice to bring about the desired effect. The  pressure is applied while the child sleeps, and is at once relaxed if  the child wakes or cries. The apparatus, known as TADAL (see Fig. 3),  consists of a stout flat bar of wood, some nine inches in length  and three wide in its middle part. This wider middle part bears on  one surface a soft pad for application to the infant's forehead. A  [inverted T] strap of soft cloth is attached by its upper  extremity to the middle of the upper edge of the wooden bar; and each  end of its horizontal strip is continued by a pair of strings which  pass through holes in the ends of the bar. The strings are brought  together on the front of the bar at its middle and passed through the  centre of a copper coin[36] or other hard disc. The bar is applied  transversely to the forehead of the infant; the vertical strap runs  back over the sagittal suture; the transverse strap is drawn tightly  across the occiput, and the required degree of pressure is gradually  applied by twisting the coin round and round on the front of the bar,  and so pulling upon the strings which connect the ends of the bar on  the forehead with the ends of the strap across the occiput (Pl. 33).    The effect produced is of course a flattening of brow and occiput and  a broadening of the whole head. The motive seems to be the desire to  enhance the beauty of the child by ensuring to it a moon-like face,  which is the most admired form. The Malanaus seem to be by nature  peculiarly round-headed; the question whether this is due to the  effects of head-flattening practised for many generations, must be  left to the investigations of the Neo-Lamarckians. They are also a  peculiarly handsome people, and it seems more likely that, taking a  pride in their good looks, they have, like so many other peoples,  sought to enhance the beauty of their children by accentuating a  racial peculiarity.      Houses    All the tribes except the Punans build houses of one type; but the size  and proportions, the strength of the materials used, and the skill and  care displayed in the work of construction, show wide differences. The  houses of the Kayans are perhaps better and more solidly built than any  others and may be taken as the type. Each house is built to accommodate  many families; an average house may contain some forty to fifty,  making up with children and slaves some two or three hundred persons;  while some of the larger houses are built for as many as a hundred  and twenty families, or some five to six hundred persons. The house  is always close to a river, and it usually stands on the bank at a  distance of 20 to 50 yards from the water, its length lying parallel  to the course of the river. The plan of the house is a rectangle,  of which the length generally much exceeds the width (Pl. 34).    Its roof is always a simple ridge extending the whole length of the  house, and is made of shingles of BILIAN (ironwood) or other hard  and durable kind of wood. The framework of the roof is supported at  a height of some 25 to 30 feet from the ground on massive piles of  ironwood, and the floor is supported by the same piles at a level some  7 or 8 feet below the cross-beams of the roof. The floor consists  of cross-beams morticed to the piles, and of very large planks of  hard wood laid upon them parallel to the length of the house. The  projecting eaves of the roof come down to a level midway between  that of the roof-beams and that of the floor, and the interval of  some 4 to 5 feet between the eaves and the floor remains open along  the whole length of the front of the house (I.E. the side facing the  river), save for a low parapet which bounds the floor along its outer  edge. This space serves to admit both light and air, and affords an  easy view over the river to those sitting in the house. The length  of the house is in some cases as much as 400 yards, but the average  length is probably about 200 yards. The width of the floor varies  from about 30 to 60 feet; the whole space between roof and floor is  divided into two parts by a longitudinal wall of vertical planks,  which runs the whole length of the house. This wall lies not quite  in the middle line, but a little to the river side of it. Of the two  longitudinal divisions of the house, that which adjoins the river  is thus somewhat narrower than the other; it remains undivided in  its whole length. The other and wider part is divided by transverse  walls at intervals of some 25 or 30 feet, so as to form a single row  of spacious chambers of approximately equal size. Each such chamber is  the private apartment of one family; in it father, mother, daughters,  young sons and female slaves, sleep and eat (Pl. 37). Within each  chamber are usually several sleeping-places or alcoves more or less  completely screened or walled off from the central space. The chamber  contains a fireplace, generally merely a slab of clay in a wooden  framework placed near the centre. The outside wall of this side of  the house is carried up to meet the roof. The entrance of light and  air and the egress of smoke are provided for by the elevation on a  prop of one corner of a square section of the roof, marked out by a  right-angled cut, of which one limb runs parallel to the outer wall,  the other upwards from one extremity of the former. This aperture  can be easily closed, E.G. during heavy rain, by removing the prop  and allowing the flap to fall into its original position.    The front part of the house, which remains undivided, forms a single  long gallery serving as a common antechamber to all the private rooms,  each of which opens to it by a wooden door (Pls. 36, 38). It is in  a sense, though roofed and raised some 20 feet above the ground, the  village street, as well as a common living and reception room. Along  the outer border of the floor runs a low platform on which the inmates  sit on mats. One part of this, usually that opposite the chief's  apartment in the middle of the house, is formed of several large  slabs of hardwood (TAPANG or Koompassia), and is specially reserved  for the reception of guests and for formal meetings. The platform  is interrupted here and there by smaller platforms raised some 3 or  4 feet from the floor, which are the sleeping quarters assigned to  the bachelors and male visitors. At intervals of some 30 or 40 feet  throughout the gallery are fireplaces similar to those in the private  chambers; on some of these fire constantly smoulders.    Over one of these fireplaces, generally one near the middle of  the great gallery, is hung a row of human heads (Pl. 38), trophies  obtained in war, together with a number of charms and objects used  in various rites.[37]    Alongside the inner wall of the gallery stand the large wooden mortars  used by the women in husking the PADI. Above these hang the winnowing  trays and mats, and on this wall hang also various implements of  common use -- hats, paddles, fish-traps, and so forth.    The gallery is reached from the ground by several ladders, each  of which consists of a notched beam sloping at an angle of about  45[degree], and furnished with a slender hand-rail. The more carefully  made ladder is fashioned from a single log, but the wood is so cut as  to leave a hand-rail projecting forwards a few inches on either side  of the notched gully or trough in which the feet are placed. From  the foot of each ladder a row of logs, notched and roughly squared,  and laid end to end, forms a foot-way to the water's edge. In wet  weather such a foot-way is a necessity, because pigs, fowls, and dogs,  and in some cases goats, run freely beneath and around the house,"]]]
