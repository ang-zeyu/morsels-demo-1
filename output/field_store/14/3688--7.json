[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#11)"],[1,"_eggs_ should be sought for in the month of May, or a little  earlier or later, on the buds and young shoots of the two species of  Buckthorn (_Rhamnus Frangula_ and _R. Catharticus_). When examined with the  microscope, these are found to be very pretty objects of conical form, with  sculptured ribs on the sides.    The _caterpillar_ that results from these, when it grows up, is of a fine  green colour, shagreened over with black points, and shading off into a  paler line along the side. Its shape is represented at Plate I. fig. 2. It  is found on the _young_ buckthorn foliage that forms its food.    The _chrysalis_ is of the remarkable shape shown on Plate I. fig.  13,--green, marked with yellow. It remains in this state for about twenty  days, when the perfect butterfly appears.    The general colour of the male Brimstone Butterfly is a clear, brilliant  yellow, much like that of the Daffodil, its contemporary; and in the centre  of each wing is a small spot of rich orange-colour. A very beautiful  feature to be remarked in this butterfly is the silken mane, so to speak,  composed of long hairs of silvery gloss and whiteness, which are arranged  as if combed up from the sides of the thorax, so as to meet in a crested  form over the top.    The female chiefly differs from the male in the ground colour of the wings,  which are of a pale and very peculiar greenish white tint, rather more  deeply tinged with yellow at the extremities of the wings.    As the male, from his colour, bears the name of \"Brimstone,\" or \"Sulphur,\"  the complexion of his mate may be accurately compared to the tint of  another {70} sulphureous preparation, called by druggists \"milk of  sulphur.\"    The only noticeable variation this butterfly is subject to in this country  is in the size of the orange wing-spots, which are sometimes greatly  enlarged.    In a well-marked variety, common in the south of Europe, Madeira, &c., this  enlargement reaches a great development, nearly the whole of the _upper_  wings being suffused with a deep orange, though in all other respects the  insect does not differ from our common form. This beautiful variety has  been described as a different species under the name of _Gonepteryx  Cleopatra_; but M. Boisduval has proved that they are identical, by rearing  both the ordinary _Rhamni_ and the _Cleopatra_ from the same batch of eggs.    The female _Cleopatra_ does not differ materially from _Rhamni_. I look on  this variety as very interesting, as a probable instance of the direct  effect of increased warmth of climate in intensifying colour.[9]    Plentiful as this butterfly is in all the southern counties, and extending  in more or less abundance as {71} far northwards as the lake district, it  there becomes scarce; and I can find no instance of its having occurred in  Scotland.    Of course, its prevalence in any district is naturally regulated by the  abundance of its food-plants, the buckthorns.    Gardens, fields, and lanes are equally the resort of this favourite insect;  and there the newly-hatched specimens are to be found on the wing from  August to October.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CLOUDED YELLOW, OR CLOUDED SAFFRON. (_Colias Edusa._)    (Plate III. fig. 3, Male; 3A, Female.)    This richly-coloured and nimble-winged fly is ever the darling of the  collector. None make a finer show in the cabinet, and few tempt pursuit  more strongly than does this golden beauty when on the wing.    For many years past, and up to quite a recent period, the appearance of  this butterfly in any abundance was a phenomenon only occurring at  uncertain periods, separated by intervals of several years. In one season,  perhaps, hardly a solitary specimen would be seen, and in the very next, a  swarm of them would spread over the southern counties, delighting the  fly-catcher and puzzling the naturalist to find a sufficient reason for  {72} this sudden burst of insect-life. Whether the eggs lay dormant for  years, till hatched under peculiarly favourable conditions; or whether  every now and then a few individuals were tempted to cross the Channel from  the Continent by some attraction unknown to us, or were, _nolens_,  _volens_, blown hither by the wind, and then deposited eggs which produced  the next year's troop of butterflies; or, lastly, whether an agency was at  work here, of whose nature we are entirely ignorant,--all these are  questions that still remain to be answered. There is, I believe, no  foundation for the opinion sometimes held by entomologists, that this  species prevails at _regular_ periods, such as once in four, or once in  seven years. In fact, for the last two or three years its permanent  residence and appearance among us seems to be established, while, at the  same time, its northward range has been greatly extended, a considerable  number having been taken even _in Scotland_--its existence in that country  having been previously quite unheard of.    The environs of London, especially on the south side, have been abundantly  visited by this charming insect; but its tastes have a decidedly maritime  tendency, and we find it has a marked preference for the _South Coast_;  abounding, again, more especially towards the eastern end. Its favourite  resorts are clover and lucerne fields, though dry flowery meadows, open  downs, and the sides of railway-banks are also the scenes of its lively  flight--for _Edusa_ has indeed a lively flight, and his pursuer has need of  the \"seven-league boots,\" with the hand of {73} Mercury, to insure success  in the fair open race, if that can be called a fair race at all, between a  heavy biped, struggling and perspiring about a slippery hill-side, such as  _Edusa_ loves,--and a winged spirit of air, to whom up-hill and down-hill  seem all one.    In truth, the best way to get _Edusa_ is to watch and mark him down on a  flower, then creep cautiously up till within range, raise the net quietly,  and _strike rapidly downwards_ over the insect, who usually darts _upward_  when struck at; and, in nine cases out of ten, _Edusa_ will be fluttering  under the net. It is not the most heroic style of sport, this, but it fills  the boxes admirably.    The _caterpillar_ is of a deep green colour, having on each side a white  line, marked with yellow and orange. It may be sought for in June and July,  on various plants of the leguminous order, which form its food, such as  None-such Trefoil (_Medicago lupulina_), Lucerne (_M. Sativa_), and Clover.    The _chrysalis_ is in shape between that of the Brimstone, and Cabbage  butterfly, green with a yellow stripe, and rust-coloured dots.    The _butterfly_ seldom is seen on the wing till July, but August is its  great season; and it lingers with us till late in autumn.    I remember the pleasure with which, on a chill, stormy day in October, I  watched the sports of a pair who were my sole companions while sketching,  in a remote, rocky nook of the South Welsh coast. Very {74} battered and  weather-worn were the pretty creatures, but still retaining much of the  golden bloom of their summer dress.    The Clouded Yellow has been found hybernating in the chink of an old wall  at the end of February, but I am not aware of its coming out again in the  spring, like the Brimstone.    The ground tint of the wings is an exceedingly rich orange-yellow, or  saffron colour, surrounded by a border of very dark brown, sometimes nearly  black. This border is marked, in the male, with thin yellow _lines_, and in  the female with _paler yellow spots_. There is a beautiful rose tint in the  fringe of the wings and on their front edge. Underneath the wings are paler  yellow, taking a citron hue in some parts, and marked with black and brown;  in the centre of the under wings is a brown-circled silvery spot.    There is a peculiar and constant _variety of the female_, in which all the  yellow portion of the upper surface is replaced by a _greenish white_ tint;  but in every other respect the insect agrees with the common form of  _Edusa_. This interesting variety was formerly ranked as another species,  under the name of _C. Helice_; but it is a curious fact that no  corresponding variety of the male has ever been observed; and last year I  captured a pair together--a white female and common orange male--who were  on those terms of tender intimacy which are generally supposed to betoken  identity of species. {75}    Varieties of the female are also met with, of various intermediate shades  of colour between the white and the ordinary orange.    Yet is it not possible that all these varieties may be mules between _C.  Edusa_ and _C. Hyale_ (the next species), the males of which are often seen  pursuing the lady _Edusas_? but if so, as indeed it would be on any other  hypothesis, it is hard to account for the unvarying character of the male.    This butterfly is also called the Clouded Saffron.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CLOUDED SULPHUR, OR PALE CLOUDED YELLOW BUTTERFLY. (_Colias Hyale._)    (Plate III. fig. 4.)    We may, in general, readily distinguish this elegant insect from the last  species--the females of which it rather resembles in its markings--by the  difference in the ground tint of the wings, which in this vary from  primrose or sulphur yellow to a greenish white.    There is, however, some risk of confounding this with the white variety of  _Edusa_ (_Helice_), a mistake often committed by young entomologists; so it  will be well to point out the most prominent distinction between the two;  and this is easily done, by observing that in _Edusa_ the dark border of  the upper wings is of nearly {76} equal breadth along the whole of the  outer margin, and _at the lower corner is continued inwards for a short  distance_; whilst in _Hyale_ this border _narrows rapidly, and disappears  before reaching the lower corner of_ the wing. Also the dark border of the  hind wings is much broader in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#11)"],[1,"nts, or as lodgers,  either tolerated or hostile to their hosts and persecuted, and parasites,  is very great. The most interesting of these from the ordinary observer's  point of view are the true guests and the lodgers. The true guests are  carefully attended to by the ants; they include such insects as the  _Aphides_ or plant lice, and others which the ants use as \"cows\" to secure  the saccharine juices which they can obtain from them, and also certain  strange beetles which have tufts of golden hairs on their body, which the  ants lick--on account of what E. Wasmann[2] calls the etherealized oil {89}  given off by them. These beetles are fairly numerous and belong to several  quite distinct families; the one which perhaps is amongst the most  interesting is a creature called _Lomechusa strumosa_. This insect has  rather an interesting history in connexion with our British fauna. It used  to be considered as an indigenous insect, but so many years passed without  any one finding it, that the old records were suspected as doubtful, and it  was removed from the list of British species. In 1906, however, it was  rediscovered near Woking in a nest of _Formica sanguinea_ (pl. A, 1, 2, 3),  one of the large red ants, by Mr. H. Donisthorpe. The life-history of  _Lomechusa_ is a very curious one: it is taken great care of by the ants,  and its larvae are even placed by them with their own, on which it feeds.  Its numbers are kept down apparently by the overzeal of the ants to take  care of them. The ants bring their own pupae up frequently to obtain light  and air and with them it brings up the _Lomechusa_ pupae--this seems not to  suit the latter and results in the death of many of them. It is a most  interesting case of how a due balance can be maintained, and what might  prove an enemy {90} kept in his proper place by kind intentions. There are  also in ants' nests what Dr. Wasmann calls \"tolerated lodgers\"; these are  mostly creatures which are supposed to escape the notice of the ants,  either by their small size or by their slow, lethargic, or on the other  hand very rapid movements--these in many cases act as scavengers, living on  the dead bodies of insects, etc., brought in by the ants.    The hostile lodgers are real enemies to the ants and devour their brood,  and in consequence they are always at war with each other. These creatures  generally resemble the ants considerably in form and colour and especially  in their movements.    Besides these lodgers there are numerous parasites of the ants, such as  mites, etc., so that an ant colony is a very wonderful mixture of diverse  inhabitants. The distinctions given above as to the habits of the various  lodgers are not always kept up, as, in some, two or more of these habits  are combined. The whole study of ants and their guests is a most  fascinating one: many of the latter are great rarities and much sought  after by collectors. Unfortunately, the great {91} drawback in collecting  them is the havoc caused to the nests of the ants. These structures have  been the result of enormous labour on the part of these little creatures,  and one cannot regard their destruction without sincere regret. I think any  one who, when collecting beetles, disturbs a large nest of the little  garden ant (_Lasius niger_) or the little yellow ant (_Lasius flavus_) by  turning over a stone, as the writer has often done himself, must have  experienced a like regret at having broken up all the beautiful passages  and galleries which the ants have constructed so carefully.           *       *       *       *       *    {92}    HOW CAN AN \"ACULEATE\" BE RECOGNIZED?    This is not an easy question to answer. We cannot make hard and fast  definitions which will determine exactly what belongs to this group and  what to that; there are always some intermediate forms which present  themselves and make our classification unsatisfactory, but, I think, for  all purposes of practical observation in the field we may say that if we  find a creature with four membranous wings, burrowing in the ground or  making a nest in any way, it is an aculeate or stinger. Also, that if we  find a hairy-bodied insect with four clear wings collecting pollen or  sucking nectar from a flower it is a bee. There are, of course, characters  by which the stinging groups can be known almost for certain, but there is  no single one which can be given to recognize them by. {93} They are known  by a combination of many, and these are frequently small structural details  which do not appeal to the field observer; in fact, which are unappreciable  except under magnification. One of the chief difficulties experienced by an  observer who is not versed in classification is to avoid being deceived by  various flies, which in many cases greatly resemble bees, and especially  wasps or the wasp-like fossors. They may mostly be known by their flight,  and, when they settle, by their behaviour. A fly is more sudden in its  movements--those wasp-like flies, for instance, which poise themselves in  the air and appear quite stationary but dart off in a second when  approached, betray themselves at once by their alertness. _Anthophora_ and  _Saropoda_ poise in the air and dart somewhat after the same fashion, but  they never remain poised for long, and do not get away from their position  so rapidly. Also, a fly when it settles remains quiet, whereas an aculeate  if in a flower sets to work collecting pollen, or if basking in the sun on  a leaf rarely rests for many seconds without moving in some way. On a  flower, if an insect is seen quietly sitting with its head away from the  centre of the {94} flower, it is almost certain to be a fly. Most of the  little bees (_Halicti_) which visit dandelions and such like \"composites\"  fly in to them with some rapidity, attack them sideways, and move round the  \"flower\", no doubt getting pollen from each floret in succession and with a  businesslike action about it all, which is very different from the  behaviour of any fly. The flies which really closely resemble bees in their  flight are those which lay their eggs in the burrows of various bees and  sandwasps. They are really deceptive. Last summer on the sandhills at  Southbourne, near Bournemouth, I again and again was deceived by a small  fly with a red belt across its body, thinking it was a red-bodied sandwasp.  These it really only resembles on the wing. After having been taken in once  or twice one felt ashamed of oneself for not recognizing it. The flies also  which associate with the humble bees are often coloured very much like  them, and could easily be mistaken for small specimens of the bees were it  not for their behaviour and wings, which show a dark spot on the upper  margin, not existing in the wing of the bee.           *       *       *       *       *    {95}    MALES AND FEMALES    These differ from each other very greatly in many cases. Eccentricity in  structure almost always occurs in the male; excess of coloration usually in  the female. In size the male is generally the smaller and the less robustly  built of the two. Among the pollen-collectors, the male is usually less  densely clothed with hairs than the [female]. In the fossors this rule is  rather reversed, but in that section neither sex is densely clothed with  hairs as are most of the pollenigerous bees.    The male has normally thirteen joints in its antennae, and the female only  twelve. There are exceptions to this rule amongst the ants and in certain  fossors of the genus _Crabro_, some species of which have the antennae  considerably distorted, and have two joints welded apparently into one.  Another distinction between the sexes is that the male has seven dorsal  segments {96} of the body exposed to view, and the female only six. In the  males of some of those bees which collect pollen on the underside of the  body, the body above terminates with the sixth segment. This is because the  seventh is turned over on to the underside, and faces downwards, its apex  pointing towards the head. This arrangement of course leaves less room for  the regular ventral segments, and the usual apical segments are in  consequence \"telescoped\" up under the fourth, so that the apical opening of  the body lies on its underside between the fourth ventral and the inverted  seventh dorsal segments. This very curious structure occurs only in those  bees whose females collect pollen on the underside, and the reason of it is  to me quite inexplicable. The females of a few of the fossors are destitute  of wings; but in this country we have no wingless males, except in the case  of one little ant (_Formicoxenus_); this lives in the nest of the common  large red ant, and its male can hardly be known from the worker except by  the number of joints in the antennae and the absence of a sting. In the  cases where the female is wingless, the male as a rule is much the larger  of the two sexes. {97} There are few more puzzling questions than those  which arise over these eccentricities of structure; they seem to have no  relation to any habits of the creatures' lives so far as we can judge,  neither can one suggest any useful purpose which they can serve. In some  groups the males of all the species seem built on one regular plan--in  others the males of each species seem to vie with the next as to what  eccentricity of structure in antennae or legs or apex of the body it can  exhibit. In numbers, the males probably considerably exceed the females,  and are far more frequently met with, as they seem to be less particular as  to weather, and not being intent on obtaining food for their offspring they  fly about more casually, and certainly are more in evidence generally.    The great difference in structure, etc., between the males and females  makes the work of pairing the sexes very difficult, especially in those  genera where the males and females appear together only for a few"]]]
