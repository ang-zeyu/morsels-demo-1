I would have you likewise be lively before you die, and,  abandoning your uncouth Ideas, make it appear, that old Age can be  pleased with the Productions of Youth; otherwise you will find, that  you will be condemned by your own Words, that Ignorance hates all that  is excellent. The polite Arts have advanced continually in Refinement,  and if the rest were to give me the Lie, Musick would defend me Sword in  Hand; for she cannot arrive at a higher Pitch. Awake therefore, and, if  you are not quite out of your Senses, hearken to me; and you will  acknowledge that I speak candidly to you; and for a Proof be it known to  you----    Sec. 28. That our delicious Stile has been invented to hide with the fine  Name of _Modern_ the too difficult Rules of the _Counterpoint_, cannot  be denied.    Sec. 29. That there is an inviolable Rule amongst us, to banish for ever  the _Pathetick_, is very true; because we will have no Melancholy.    Sec. 30. But, that we should be told by the old _Bashaws_, that we strive  who can produce most extravagant Absurdities never heard before, and  that we brag to be the Inventors of them ourselves, are the malign  Reflections of those who see us exalted. Let Envy burst. You see, that  the general Esteem which we have acquired, gives it for us; and if a  Musician is not of our Tribe, he will find no Patron or Admirer. But  since we are now speaking in Confidence and with Sincerity, who can sing  or compose well, without our Approbation? Let them have ever so much  Merit (you know it) we do not want Means to ruin him; even a few  Syllables will suffice: It is only saying, He is an _Ancient_.    Sec. 31. Tell me, I beseech you, who, without us, could have brought Musick  to the Height of Happiness, with no greater Difficulty than taking from  the _Airs_ that tiresome Emulation of the first and second Violin, and  of the Tenor? Is there any that ever durst usurp the Glory of it? We, we  are those, who by our Ingenuity have raised her to this Degree of  Sublimity, in taking also from her that noisy murmuring of the  fundamental Basses, in such Manner,----(mark me well, and learn) that  if in an _Orchestre_ there were an hundred Violins, we are capable of  composing in such a Manner, that all and every one shall play the very  _Air_ which the Voice sings. What say you to that? Can you have the Face  to find Fault with us?    Sec. 32. Our most lovely Method, that obliges none of us to the painful  Study of the Rules; which does not disquiet the Mind with the Anxiety of  Speculation, nor delude us with the Study of reducing them into  Practice; that does not prejudice the Health; that enchants the Ear _a  la Mode_; that finds those who love it, who prize it, and who pay for it  the Weight in Gold; and dare you to criticise upon it?    Sec. 33. What shall we say of the obscure and tedious Compositions of those  whom you celebrate as the Top of the Universe, tho' your Opinion goes  for nothing? Don't you perceive that those old-fashioned Crabbednesses  are disgustful? We should be great Fools to grow pale, and become  paralytick in studying and finding out in the Scores, the Harmony, the  _Fugues_, their _Reverses_, the _Double Counterpoint_, the  Multiplication of Subjects, to contract them closer, to make _Canons_,  and such other dry Stuff, that are no more in _Mode_, and (what is  worse) are of little Esteem, and less Profit. What say you now to this,  _Master Critick_? Have you comprehended me?----Yes, Sir. Well, what  Answer do you make me?----None.    Sec. 34. Really, I am astonished, O beloved Singers, at the profound  Lethargy in which you remain, and which is so much to your Disadvantage.  'Tis You that ought to awaken, for now is the Time, and tell the  Composers of this Stamp, that your Desire is to Sing, and not to Dance.          CHAP. VIII.    _Of_ Cadences.[78]      The _Cadences_, that terminate the _Airs_, are of two Sorts. The  Composers call the one _Superior_, and the other _Inferior_. To make  myself better understood by a Scholar, I mean, if a _Cadence_ were in  _C_ natural, the Notes of the first would be _La, Sol, Fa;_ and those of  the second _Fa, Mi, Fa_. In _Airs_ for a single Voice, or in  _Recitatives_, a Singer may chuse which of these _Closes_ or _Cadences_  pleases him best; but if in Concert with other Voices, or accompanied  with Instruments, he must not change the Superior for the Inferior, nor  this with the other.[79]    Sec. 2. It would be superfluous to speak of the broken _Cadences_, they  being become familiar even to those who are not Professors of Musick,  and which serve at most but in _Recitatives_.[80]    Sec. 3. As for those _Cadences_ that fall a fifth, they were never composed  in the old Stile for a _Soprano_, in an _Air_ for a single Voice, or  with Instruments, unless the Imitation of some Words had obliged the  Composer thereto. Yet these, having no other Merit, but of being the  easiest of all, as well for the Composer as for the Singer, are at  present the most prevailing.[81]    Sec. 4. In the Chapter on _Airs_, I have exhorted the Student to avoid that  Torrent of _Passages_ and _Divisions_, so much in the _Mode_, and did  engage myself also, to give my weak Sentiments on the _Cadences_ that  are now current; and I am now ready: But, however, with the usual  Protestation of submitting them, with all my other Opinions, to the  Tribunal of the Judicious, and those of Taste, from whence there is no  Appeal; that they, as sovereign Judges of the Profession, may condemn  the Abuses of the _modern Cadences_, or the Errors of my Opinion.    Sec. 5. Every _Air_ has (at least) three _Cadences_, that are all three  final. Generally speaking, the Study of the Singers of the present Times  consists in terminating the _Cadence_ of the first Part with an  overflowing of _Passages_ and _Divisions_ at Pleasure, and the  _Orchestre_ waits; in that of the second[82] the Dose is encreased, and  the _Orchestre_ grows tired; but on the last _Cadence_, the Throat is  set a going, like a Weather-cock in a Whirlwind, and the _Orchestre_  yawns. But why must the World be thus continually deafened with so many  _Divisions_? I must (with your leave, _Gentlemen Moderns_) say in Favour  of the Profession, that good Taste does not consist in a continual  Velocity of the Voice, which goes thus rambling on, without a Guide, and  without Foundation; but rather, in the _Cantabile_, in the putting forth  the Voice agreeably, in _Appoggiatura's_, in Art, and in the true Notion  of Graces, going from one Note to another with singular and unexpected  Surprizes, and stealing the Time exactly on the true _Motion_ of the  Bass. These are the principal and indispensible Qualities which are most  essential to the singing well, and which no musical Ear can find in your  capricious _Cadences_. I must still add, that very _anciently_ the Stile  of the Singers was insupportable, (as I have been informed by the  Master who taught me to _Sol-fa_) by reason of the Number of _Passages_  and _Divisions_ in their _Cadences_, that never were at an end, as they  are now; and that they were always the same, just as they are now. They  became at last so odious, that, as a Nusance to the Sense of Hearing,  they were banished without so much as attempting their Correction. Thus  will it also happen to These, at the first Example given by a Singer  whose Credit is established, and who will not be seduced by a vain  popular Applause. This Reformation the succeeding Professors of Eminence  prescribed to themselves as a Law, which perhaps would not have been  abolished, were they in a Condition to be heard; but the Opulency of  some, Loss of the Voice, Age and Death of others, has deprived the  Living from hearing what was truly worthy our Admiration in Singing. Now  the Singers laugh at the Reformers, and their Reformation of the  _Passages_ in the _Cadences_; and on the contrary, having recalled them  from their Banishment, and brought them on the Stage, with some little  _Caricatura_ to boot, they impose them on the Ignorant for rare  Inventions, and gain themselves immense Sums; it giving them no Concern  that they have been abhorr'd and detested for fifty or sixty Years, or  for an hundred Ages. But who can blame them? However, if Reason should  make this Demand of them, with what unjust Pretence can you usurp the  Name of _Moderns_, if you sing in a most _Ancient_ Stile? Perhaps, you  think that these overflowings of your Throat are what procure you Riches  and Praises? Undeceive yourselves, and thank the great Number of  Theatres, the Scarcity of excellent Performers, and the Stupidity of  your Auditors. What could they answer? I know not. But let us call them  to a stricter Account.    Sec. 6. _Gentlemen Moderns_, can you possibly deny, but that you laugh  among yourselves, when you have Recourse to your long-strung _Passages_  in the _Cadences_, to go a begging for Applause from the blind Ignorant?  You call this Trick by the Name of an _Alms_, begging for Charity as it  were for those _E Viva's_, which, you very well know, you do not deserve  from Justice. And in return you laugh at your Admirers, tho' they have  not Hands, Feet, nor Voice enough to applaud you. Is this Justice? Is  this Gratitude?----Oh! if they ever should find you out! My beloved  Singers, tho' the Abuses of your _Cadences_ are of use to you, they are  much more prejudicial to the Profession, and are the greatest Faults you  can commit; because at the same time you know yourselves to be in the  Wrong. For your own Sakes undeceive the World, and employ the rare  Talent you are endowed with on Things that are worthy of you. In the  mean while I will return with more Courage to my Opinions.    Sec. 7. I should be very desirous to[83] know, on what Foundation certain  _Moderns_ of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#11)"],[1,"lady at a distribution  of patriotic gifts, \"aren't you one of our heroes?\" \"No, ma'am,\"  answered the soldier, \"I'm only a regular.\"    The question of command was often a very vexed one; and many mistakes  were made before the final answers came. The most significant of  all emergent facts was this: that though the officers who had been  regulars before the war did not form a hundredth part of all who  held commissions during it, yet these old regulars alone supplied  every successful high commander, Federal and Confederate alike,  both afloat and ashore.    The North had four times as many whites as the South; it used more  blacks as soldiers; and the complete grand total of all the men  who joined its forces during the war reached two millions and  three-quarters. But this gives a quite misleading idea of the real  odds in favor of the North, especially the odds available in battle.  A third of the Northern people belonged to the peace party and  furnished no recruits at all till after conscription came in. The  late introduction of conscription, the abominable substitution  clause, and the prevalence of bounty-jumping combined to reduce  both the quantity and quality of the recruits obtained by money or  compulsion. The Northerners that did fight were generally fighting  in the South, among a very hostile population, which, while it made  the Southern lines of communication perfectly safe, threatened  those of the North at every point and thus obliged the Northern  armies to leave more and more men behind to guard the communications  that each advance made longer still. Finally, the South generally  published the numbers of only its actual combatants, while the  Northern returns always included every man drawing pay, whether  a combatant or not. On the whole, the North had more than double  numbers, even if compared with a Southern total that includes  noncombatants. But it should be remembered that a Northern army  fighting in the heart of the South, and therefore having to guard  every mile of the way back home, could not meet a Southern one  with equal strength in battle unless it had left the North with  fully twice as many.    Conscription came a year later (1863) in the North than in the  South and was vitiated by a substitution clause. The fact that a  man could buy himself out of danger made some patriots call it \"a  rich man's war and a poor man's fight.\" And the further fact that  substitutes generally became regular bounty-jumpers, who joined  and deserted at will, over and over again, went far to increase the  disgust of those who really served. Frank Wilkeson's _Recollections  of a Private Soldier in the Army of the Potomac_ is a true voice from  the ranks when he explains \"how the resort to volunteering, the  unprincipled dodge of cowardly politicians, ground up the choicest  seed-corn of the nation; how it consumed the young, the patriotic,  the intelligent, the generous, and the brave; and how it wasted  the best moral, social, and political elements of the Republic,  leaving the cowards, shirkers, egotists, and moneymakers to stay  at home and procreate their kind.\"    That is to say, it was so arranged that the foxy-witted lived, while  the lion-hearted died.    The organization of the vast numbers enrolled was excellent whenever  experts were given a free hand. But this free hand was rare. One  vital point only needs special notice here: the wastefulness of  raising new regiments when the old ones were withering away for  want of reinforcements. A new local regiment made a better \"story\"  in the press; and new and superfluous regiments meant new and  superfluous colonels, mostly of the speechifying kind. So it often  happened that the State authorities felt obliged to humor zealots  set on raising those brand-new regiments which doubled their own  difficulties by having to learn their lesson alone, halved the  efficiency of the old regiments they should have reinforced, and  harassed the commanders and staff by increasing the number of units  that were of different and ever-changing efficiency and strength.  It was a system of making and breaking all through.      The end came when Northern sea-power had strangled the Southern  resources and the unified Northern armies had worn out the fighting  force. Of the single million soldiers raised by the South only two  hundred thousand remained in arms, half starved, half clad, with the  scantiest of munitions, and without reserves of any kind. Meanwhile  the Northern hosts had risen to a million in the field, well fed,  well clothed, well armed, abundantly provided with munitions, and  at last well disciplined under the unified command of that great  leader, Grant. Moreover, behind this million stood another million  fit to bear arms and obtainable at will from the two millions of  enrolled reserves.    The cost of the war was stupendous. But the losses of war are not  to be measured in money. The real loss was the loss of a million  men, on both sides put together, for these men who died were of  the nation's best.          CHAPTER III    THE NAVAL WAR: 1862    Bull Run had riveted attention on the land between the opposing  capitals and on the armies fighting there. Very few people were  thinking of the navies and the sea. And yet it was at sea, and not  on land, that the Union had a force against which the Confederates  could never prevail, a force which gradually cut them off from  the whole world's base of war supplies, a force which enabled the  Union armies to get and keep the strangle-hold which did the South  to death.    The blockade declared in April was no empty threat. The sails of  Federal frigates, still more the sinister black hulls of the new  steam men-of-war, meant that the South was fast becoming a land  besieged, with every outwork accessible by water exposed to sudden  attack and almost certain capture by any good amphibious force  of soldiers and sailors combined.    Sea-power kept the North in affluence while it starved the South.  Sea-power held Maryland in its relentless grip and did more than  land-power to keep her in the Union. Sea-power was the chief factor  in saving Washington. Seapower enabled the North to hold such points  of vantage as Fortress Monroe right on the flank of the South.  And sea-power likewise enabled the North to take or retake other  points of similar importance: for instance, Hatteras Island.    In a couple of days at the end of August, 1861, the Confederate  forts at Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, were compelled to surrender  to a joint naval and military expedition under Flag-Officer Stringham  and Major-General B. F. Butler. The immediate result, besides the  capture of seven hundred men, was the control of the best entrance  to North Carolina waters, which entailed the stoppage of many oversea  supplies for the Confederate army. The ulterior result was the  securing of a base from which a further invasion could be made with  great advantage.      The naval campaign of the following year was truly epoch-making;  for the duel between the _Monitor_ and _Merrimac_ in Hampton Roads  on March 9, 1862, was the first action ever fought between ironclad  steam men-of-war.    Eleven months earlier the Federal Government had suddenly abandoned  the Norfolk Navy Yard; though their strongest garrison was at Fortress  Monroe, only twelve miles north along a waterway which was under  the absolute control of their navy, and though the Confederates'  had nothing but an inadequate little untrained force on the spot.  Among the spoils of war falling into Confederate hands were twelve  hundred guns and the _Merrimac_, a forty-gun steam frigate. The  _Merrimac_, though fired and scuttled by the Federals, was hove  up, cut down, plated over, and renamed the _Virginia_. (History,  however, knows her only as the _Merrimac_.) John L. Porter, Naval  Constructor to the Confederate States, had made a model of an ironclad  at Pittsburgh fifteen years before; and he now applied this model  to the rebuilding of the _Merrimac_. He first cut down everything  above the water line, except the gun deck, which he converted into a  regular citadel with flat top, sides sloping at thirty-five degrees,  and ends stopping short of the ship's own ends by seventy feet fore  and aft. The effect, therefore, was that of an ironclad citadel  built on the midships of a submerged frigate's hull. The four-inch  iron plating of the citadel knuckled over the wooden sides two  feet under water. The engines, which the South had no means of  replacing, were the old ones which had been condemned before being  sunk. A four-foot castiron ram was clamped on to the bow. Ten guns  were mounted: six nine-inch smooth-bores, with two six-inch and  two seven-inch rifles. Commodore Franklin Buchanan took command  and had magnificent professional officers under him. But the crew,  three hundred strong, were mostly landsmen; for, as in the case  of the Army, the men of the Navy nearly all took sides with the  North, and the South had very few seamen of any other kind.    To oppose the _Merrimac_ the dilatory North contracted with John  Ericsson the Swede, who had to build the _Monitor_ much smaller  than the Merrimac owing to pressure of time. He enjoyed, however,  enormous advantages in every other respect, owing to the vastly  superior resources of the North in marine engineering, armor-plating,  and all other points of naval construction. The _Monitor_ was launched  at New York on January 30, 1862, the hundredth day after the laying  of her keel-plate. Her length over all was 172 feet, her beam was  41, and her draught only 10--less than half the draught of the  _Merrimac_. Her whole crew numbered only 58; but every single one  was a trained professional naval seaman who had volunteered for  dangerous service under Captain John L. Worden. She was not a good  sea boat; and she nearly foundered on her way down from New York to  Fortress Monroe. Her"]]]
