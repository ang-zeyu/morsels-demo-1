[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32376"],[0,"Notes on Stable Management in India and the Colonies (#11)"],[1," They should be driven into the  ground in a slanting direction, the point towards and the head away from  the animal, to resist the strain on it. If there are no tent-pegs, or the  ground is so soft that there is no holding for them, a hole a couple of  feet deep can be dug, and a bundle of straw or a couple of tent-pegs tied  crossways buried in it, the earth trodden down, and the rope brought out  at the surface. This will give ample holding, and may be practically  tested, for although a vertical pull will easily bring it up, the  strongest man will fail to move it if the strain is horizontal.      Leading-ropes (_bagh durie_).    Leading-ropes are things that ruin half the horses' mouths in India, and I  never let such a thing into the stable. If they are used as they were  originally intended to be, that is, buckled into the ring of the snaffle  or watering bridle to lead the horse with, they do no harm; but it is  impossible to prevent \"syces\" from passing them over the head and then  back through both rings, so as to form a gag, and this they hang on to. I  always make them use a leading-chain, which is a leather strap with about  a foot of chain and a snap-hook at the end of it. The hook fastens into  the ring of the snaffle, and they cannot well pass the strap over the head  to turn it into a gag. It seems impossible to teach a \"syce\" how to lead a  horse in a watering bridle, and I find these chains the best compromise.      Brushes and Gear.    The grooming utensils required in an Indian stable are very simple: a  horse-brush, curry-comb, bucket, some dusters, and a hoof-picker, being  the sum total; but only one of these last is required among five or six  horses. It is best to get English bristle brushes, they last out two of  the native fibre ones, and are very little more expensive. Good  horse-brushes are made by several firms in Cawnpore, and, of course, when  a large number are used, the saving is considerable if the country-made  article is bought, but where only a small number are required, this is a  false economy.      Curry-combs.    These an Indian \"syce\" cannot get on without, and although he only uses it  to wear out the brush, still, after all, it does not do so very much harm;  but a bad, lazy man, if he is not prevented, will use it to scrape the  dirt off the horse with. Country-breds are generally very thin-skinned,  and feel the comb very much if scarified with it, as the \"syce\" is very  fond of doing; and I am positive that this practice in many cases has to  account for much of the proverbial bad temper of these animals. The  curry-comb should never be put on the horse's body at all, and in reality  it is useless. If it can be managed, it is best not to give the \"syces\"  such things, the only use of them being to clean the brush with, and this  can be done just as well with the palm of the left hand, and the brush  does not wear out so quickly; but it is the custom to use the comb, and it  is hard to prevent it.      Buckets (_balti_).    Buckets can be bought anywhere. Zinc ones are better than tin, although  perhaps a little more expensive; one should be provided for each horse.      Dusters (_jharans_).    Dusters are things that native servants of every sort seem to consume in  enormous quantities, and unless some check is put on it, the number used  at the end of the month will be astonishing. Either the old one should be  produced before another is given, or else some contract be given to them  to provide them for themselves; but the former plan is the best; if the  contract system is adopted, filthy rags will be used. They are luckily  exceedingly cheap, and are made nearly everywhere.      Hoof-picker (_sum khodna_).    A hoof-picker can be made out of almost any piece of rod-iron, and one  should be hung up in every stable. One for every four or five horses is  enough.      Clothing (_gurdaine_).    In Northern India, if horses are not clipped they require in the winter at  least two thick rugs, and if they are clipped an extra one, as the climate  from November to the end of February is bitterly cold. The ordinary  country clothing, made out of \"mundah,\" and sold in the bazaars, called  \"jhools,\" keeps horses warm and answers its purpose, and is cheap--a rug  of this material costing about Rs. 3; but I think myself that it is false  economy to get it, and that the horse-clothing made at the Muir or Elgin  mills at Cawnpore, or the Egerton mills at Dhariwal, in the Punjab,  although perhaps at first somewhat more expensive, will in the end be  found the cheapest, as with care one suit of this will last many years,  whereas the country clothing is seldom much good after a second winter's  wear. This clothing is made in all sorts of colours, and turned out in  suits, and is every bit as good as English manufactured. Country blankets  (kumbal) can also be got; and the condemned soldiers' blankets, that are  periodically sold by the military authorities, make excellent horse-rugs.  I always think it best to get regular horse-clothing shaped and pieced out  at the neck to buckle across the chest, or, at all events, to have one rug  like this, even if the rest are ordinary square blankets, as the shaped  clothing protects the front of the chest, which the square blanket will  not do. The blanket can be used in the daytime, and the rug on the top at  night, buckling across the chest, as leaving this part of the body exposed  is a fruitful source of coughs and colds. Aprons, breast-pieces, and  quarter-cords are seldom seen in India, except on race horses, and then  only as a fancy matter.      Hoods (_khansilla_).    Hoods with hacks, harness horses, and polo ponies are not often required;  but if horses are sensitive to cold, particularly if they are standing out  at night, they are no doubt a great protection. They are made up of the  same material as the country \"jhool,\" and they also can be got to match  the clothing made at any of the woollen mills. In any case it is a good  thing to have a spare hood in the stable, even if it is not habitually  used, as when a horse begins to cough if at once put on a severe cold is  often averted.      Body-rollers (_paities_, or _farakis_).    Body-rollers are sold in the bazaar shops of native manufacture, but are  most flimsy, and I strongly advise that either English ones, or else those  made by any of the manufacturers of leather goods at Cawnpore, which are  nearly as good as English ones, be used, although they may at first be a  little more expensive. The common country rollers are always breaking, and  never being properly stuffed, the webbing in the centre of the two pads  presses on the ridge of the spine when the roller is buckled up. There is  no more fruitful cause of sore backs than this, especially if horses are  at all thin and standing out in the open. \"Syces\" have a trick of pulling  up the straps of the roller as tight as possible, and if it gets wet with  the dew or rain it shrinks up, and the tight webbing cuts and pinches the  skin over the backbone, causing a sore back. With a properly made roller  the pressure is taken on the sides of the back by the two pads, and the  webbing does not come in contact with the skin at all. In any case, if the  horses are standing out in the open at night, it is always advisable to go  round the last thing and let the roller out a hole or two. If country  rollers are used, direct pressure of the webbing on the spine can be taken  off by putting a folded up duster or a handful of straw under it. If the  back has been pinched or rubbed the roller should be left off, and the  blankets or clothing kept in their place by a couple of tapes or pieces of  string stitched to the edge of each and tied under the body.      Bandages (_puttie_).    Woollen bandages on the legs greatly add to the horse's comfort when  standing out on a cold night. The ordinary ones sold in the bazaar answer  well enough, only they are generally a little too wide and not long  enough. The bandage should be put on commencing from below and finishing  under the knee or hock, and not in the reverse direction, commencing  above, as is often done. The tapes should be tied in a bow outside. What  is known as the Newmarket bandage, made out of a semi-elastic woollen  material, is an excellent one. It stretches somewhat when put on the leg,  and gives it support. They, however, are somewhat expensive--about Rs. 4  a set--but with ordinary care will outlast several pairs of country ones.  A good bandage is made by the Muir Mills Company at Cawnpore out of the  cotton webbing called \"newar\"; they are very cheap and good, but are not  so warm as the cotton ones.      Summer Clothing.    This is rather a superfluity, and, unless with race horses, is not usually  indulged in, for at the time it could be worn it generally is so hot that  the less the horse has on him the better. Usually one of the blankets used  in the winter is kept to throw over him when standing about, or when  walking back from work. Drill summer clothing can be obtained at any of  the woollen mills in India in a variety of patterns, or a native tailor  (durzie) will make it up in your own verandah if you give him a pattern.  At least two suits per horse are required, as it very soon gets dirty in  the warm season and requires washing.      Eye Fringes (_makieara_).    Eye fringes are absolutely necessary in India, and are used in parts of  Australia to protect the eyes from the flies. They are fastened on to the  cheek strap of the head collar with a small tab and button-hole in place  of a brow band, and have a fringe of either leather or cotton cords that  hang down over the eyes halfway to the nose. I prefer the cord ones; the  fringes are always flat and in contact with the face, whereas the leather  ones are liable to curl up at the ends and allow the flies to get  underneath. The cotton ones are easier mended than the leather.
