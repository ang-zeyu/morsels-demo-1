I became a great riddle to myself, and I asked my soul, why she  was so sad, and why she disquieted me sorely: but she knew not what to  answer me. And if I said, Trust in God, she very rightly obeyed me not;  because that most dear friend, whom she had lost, was, being man, both  truer and better than that phantasm she was bid to trust in. Only tears  were sweet to me, for they succeeded my friend, in the dearest of my  affections.    And now, Lord, these things are passed by, and time hath assuaged my  wound. May I learn from Thee, who art Truth, and approach the ear of my  heart unto Thy mouth, that Thou mayest tell me why weeping is sweet to  the miserable? Hast Thou, although present every where, cast away our  misery far from Thee? And Thou abidest in Thyself, but we are tossed  about in divers trials. And yet unless we mourned in Thine ears, we  should have no hope left. Whence then is sweet fruit gathered from the  bitterness of life, from groaning, tears, sighs, and complaints? Doth  this sweeten it, that we hope Thou hearest? This is true of prayer, for  therein is a longing to approach unto Thee. But is it also in grief for  a thing lost, and the sorrow wherewith I was then overwhelmed? For I  neither hoped he should return to life nor did I desire this with my  tears; but I wept only and grieved. For I was miserable, and had lost my  joy. Or is weeping indeed a bitter thing, and for very loathing of the  things which we before enjoyed, does it then, when we shrink from them,  please us?    But what speak I of these things? for now is no time to question, but to  confess unto Thee. Wretched I was; and wretched is every soul bound by  the friendship of perishable things; he is torn asunder when he loses  them, and then he feels the wretchedness which he had ere yet he lost  them. So was it then with me; I wept most bitterly, and found my repose  in bitterness. Thus was I wretched, and that wretched life I held dearer  than my friend. For though I would willingly have changed it, yet was I  more unwilling to part with it than with him; yea, I know not whether I  would have parted with it even for him, as is related (if not feigned)  of Pylades and Orestes, that they would gladly have died for each other  or together, not to live together being to them worse than death. But in  me there had arisen some unexplained feeling, too contrary to this, for  at once I loathed exceedingly to live and feared to die. I suppose, the  more I loved him, the more did I hate, and fear (as a most cruel enemy)  death, which had bereaved me of him: and I imagined it would speedily  make an end of all men, since it had power over him. Thus was it with  me, I remember. Behold my heart, O my God, behold and see into me; for  well I remember it, O my Hope, who cleansest me from the impurity of  such affections, directing mine eyes towards Thee, and plucking my feet  out of the snare. For I wondered that others, subject to death, did  live, since he whom I loved, as if he should never die, was dead; and I  wondered yet more that myself, who was to him a second self, could live,  he being dead. Well said one of his friend, \"Thou half of my soul\";  for I felt that my soul and his soul were \"one soul in two bodies\": and  therefore was my life a horror to me, because I would not live halved.  And therefore perchance I feared to die, lest he whom I had much loved  should die wholly.    O madness, which knowest not how to love men, like men! O foolish man  that I then was, enduring impatiently the lot of man! I fretted then,  sighed, wept, was distracted; had neither rest nor counsel. For I bore  about a shattered and bleeding soul, impatient of being borne by me, yet  where to repose it, I found not. Not in calm groves, not in games and  music, nor in fragrant spots, nor in curious banquetings, nor in the  pleasures of the bed and the couch; nor (finally) in books or poesy,  found it repose. All things looked ghastly, yea, the very light;  whatsoever was not what he was, was revolting and hateful, except  groaning and tears. For in those alone found I a little refreshment. But  when my soul was withdrawn from them a huge load of misery weighed  me down. To Thee, O Lord, it ought to have been raised, for Thee to  lighten; I knew it; but neither could nor would; the more, since, when I  thought of Thee, Thou wert not to me any solid or substantial thing. For  Thou wert not Thyself, but a mere phantom, and my error was my God. If  I offered to discharge my load thereon, that it might rest, it glided  through the void, and came rushing down again on me; and I had remained  to myself a hapless spot, where I could neither be, nor be from thence.  For whither should my heart flee from my heart? Whither should I  flee from myself? Whither not follow myself? And yet I fled out of my  country; for so should mine eyes less look for him, where they were not  wont to see him. And thus from Thagaste, I came to Carthage.    Times lose no time; nor do they roll idly by; through our senses they  work strange operations on the mind. Behold, they went and came day by  day, and by coming and going, introduced into my mind other imaginations  and other remembrances; and little by little patched me up again with my  old kind of delights, unto which that my sorrow gave way. And yet there  succeeded, not indeed other griefs, yet the causes of other griefs. For  whence had that former grief so easily reached my very inmost soul, but  that I had poured out my soul upon the dust, in loving one that must  die, as if he would never die? For what restored and refreshed me  chiefly was the solaces of other friends, with whom I did love, what  instead of Thee I loved; and this was a great fable, and protracted lie,  by whose adulterous stimulus, our soul, which lay itching in our ears,  was being defiled. But that fable would not die to me, so oft as any of  my friends died. There were other things which in them did more take my  mind; to talk and jest together, to do kind offices by turns; to read  together honied books; to play the fool or be earnest together; to  dissent at times without discontent, as a man might with his own self;  and even with the seldomness of these dissentings, to season our more  frequent consentings; sometimes to teach, and sometimes learn; long for  the absent with impatience; and welcome the coming with joy. These and  the like expressions, proceeding out of the hearts of those that loved  and were loved again, by the countenance, the tongue, the eyes, and  a thousand pleasing gestures, were so much fuel to melt our souls  together, and out of many make but one.    This is it that is loved in friends; and so loved, that a man's  conscience condemns itself, if he love not him that loves him again, or  love not again him that loves him, looking for nothing from his person  but indications of his love. Hence that mourning, if one die, and  darkenings of sorrows, that steeping of the heart in tears, all  sweetness turned to bitterness; and upon the loss of life of the dying,  the death of the living. Blessed whoso loveth Thee, and his friend in  Thee, and his enemy for Thee. For he alone loses none dear to him, to  whom all are dear in Him who cannot be lost. And who is this but our  God, the God that made heaven and earth, and filleth them, because by  filling them He created them? Thee none loseth, but who leaveth. And  who leaveth Thee, whither goeth or whither fleeth he, but from Thee  well-pleased, to Thee displeased? For where doth he not find Thy law in  his own punishment? And Thy law is truth, and truth Thou.    Turn us, O God of Hosts, show us Thy countenance, and we shall be whole.  For whithersoever the soul of man turns itself, unless toward Thee, it  is riveted upon sorrows, yea though it is riveted on things beautiful.  And yet they, out of Thee, and out of the soul, were not, unless they  were from Thee. They rise, and set; and by rising, they begin as it were  to be; they grow, that they may be perfected; and perfected, they wax  old and wither; and all grow not old, but all wither. So then when they  rise and tend to be, the more quickly they grow that they may be, so  much the more they haste not to be. This is the law of them. Thus much  has Thou allotted them, because they are portions of things, which  exist not all at once, but by passing away and succeeding, they together  complete that universe, whereof they are portions. And even thus is our  speech completed by signs giving forth a sound: but this again is not  perfected unless one word pass away when it hath sounded its part, that  another may succeed. Out of all these things let my soul praise Thee,  O God, Creator of all; yet let not my soul be riveted unto these things  with the glue of love, through the senses of the body. For they go  whither they were to go, that they might not be; and they rend her with  pestilent longings, because she longs to be, yet loves to repose in what  she loves. But in these things is no place of repose; they abide not,  they flee; and who can follow them with the senses of the flesh? yea,  who can grasp them, when they are hard by? For the sense of the flesh is  slow, because it is the sense of the flesh; and thereby is it bounded.  It sufficeth for that it was made for; but it sufficeth not to stay  things running their course from their appointed starting-place to the  end appointed. For in Thy Word, by which they are created, they hear  their decree, \"hence and hitherto.\"    Be not foolish, O my soul, nor become deaf in the ear of thine heart  with the tumult of thy folly. Hearken thou too.    The Word itself calleth thee to return: and there is the place of rest  imperturbable, where love is not forsaken, if itself forsaketh not.

The tube is  tilted to keep the electrode away from the drawn-out end, which is  melted off and sealed. A small perforation is made with a hot platinum  or iron wire in the sealed end, the electrode is shaken into position,  and the sealing is completed as explained on page 42.    The remainder of the tube, that is to say the lead-glass tube and the  bulb on the other side of the middle bulb, is completed in a similar  manner.      SUMMARY OF CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS IN GLASS-BLOWING.    For the convenience of the student, it may be well to summarise the  chief essentials for success in glass-blowing, and at the same time to  add such brief notes on the various methods as may seem desirable.    _Adjustment of Blowpipe._--The air jet should be clean internally, and  so centered as to give a flame having a well-defined blue portion, the  tip of the flame should not be only slightly luminous but purple in  colour. In the case of a blowpipe burning oil or wax fuel the flame may  be a trifle more ragged without disadvantage.    _Bellows and Blowing._--The bellows should be adjusted to deliver air at  constant pressure, either by insertion of a tap or, better, by attention  to the wind reservoir if necessary. The movement of the foot in blowing  should be steady, not jerky.    _Heating Glass._--The tube or rod should be heated cautiously until it  has reached its softening point in its thickest part. Steady rotation of  the glass during the heating is almost essential.    _Blowing a Bulb or Expanding a Join._--Prolonged heating is necessary in  order that the thick parts may be heated completely through. Blowing  should take place by stages, in order that the thin parts, which tend  to expand first, have time to cool. The thick parts can then be expanded  by further blowing and thus a bulb or expansion of even thickness can be  obtained.    _Cutting Glass._--The most useful method for general use is by means of  the file or glass-blowers' knife. Either file or knife must be kept  sharp by grinding. Neither file nor knife should be used on hot glass.  The diamond and wheel cutter are useful for cutting sheet-glass, and  when the diamond is employed a singing noise is an indication of a  satisfactory cut.    _Leading a Crack._--A crack may be led in any desired direction by means  of a bead of hot glass or a small gas flame. The glass which it is  desired to crack should be heated at a point slightly in advance of the  crack, which will extend in the direction of the source of the heat.    _Turning Out the End of a Tube._--This is done by heating the end of the  tube and rotating it against an iron rod. The rod must be kept polished  and free from rust, and it must not be allowed to become too hot while  in use, otherwise the glass will stick to it.    _Joining Unlike Glasses._--Joints between unlike glasses are often  unstable. When such joints are made it is desirable to blow them as thin  as possible, and to avoid the junction of unlike glasses in any complex  joint, such as an internal seal. A transitional portion of tubing may be  built up by the successive addition and interfusion of beads of one of  the glasses to the end of a sealed tube consisting of the other glass.    _Joining a Tube to a Very Thin Bulb._--The bulb may be thickened at the  point of union by fusing on a bead of glass and expanding this slightly.  A small central portion of the expanded part may then be perforated by  bursting and the tube joined on.    _Insertion of One Bulb Within Another._--A bulb may be divided into two  halves by leading a crack round it and the inner bulb is then  introduced. The two halves of the outer bulb may be fitted together  (care being taken to avoid any damage to the edges), and the bulb may be  completed by rotating the contacting edges before the blowpipe until  they are soft, and then expanding slightly by means of air-pressure.    _Annealing._--For most purposes, in the case of thin, blowpipe-made or  lamp-blown glass apparatus, it is sufficient to cool slowly by rotating  the finished article over a smoky flame and setting it aside in a place  free from draughts, and where the hot glass will not come in contact  with anything.    Simple bulbs and joints do not even need this smoking; but thick  articles, and especially those that are to be subjected to the stress of  grinding, need more prolonged annealing in a special oven.    _Use of Lead-Glass._--When lead-glass is to be used, the blowpipe flame  should be in good adjustment and the glass should not be allowed to  approach so near to the blue cone as to be blackened. Slight blackening  may often be removed by heating the glass in the extreme end of the  flame.    Lead-glass articles tend to be rather more stable than similar articles  of soda-glass.    _Combustion-Glass._--This may be worked more easily if a small  percentage of oxygen is introduced into the air with which the blowpipe  flame is produced. If the air is replaced entirely by oxygen there is a  risk of damaging the blowpipe jet, unless a special blowpipe is  employed.    _Internal Seal._--There are two ways of making these, one, in which the  inner portion of the tube is fused on to the inside of the bulb or tube  through which it is to pass, an opening is made by bursting and the  outer tube is joined on. This is a quick and in some ways more  satisfactory method than the other, in which there is no separate inner  piece.    _Rubber Blowing Tube._--In complicated work it is often convenient to  use a thin rubber blowing-tube which is connected with the work either  by a cork and piece of glass tubing or by fitting over a drawn-out end.  The use of such a blowing-tube avoids the inconvenience of raising the  work to the mouth when internal air-pressure is required. One end of the  rubber tube is retained in the mouth during work.    _General Notes._--A large amount of glass-blowing is spoiled through  carelessness in arranging the work beforehand. The student should have  every detail of his manipulation clearly in mind before he commences the  work; he should not trust to evolving the method during the actual  manipulation.    Undue haste is another fruitful source of failure. Practically every  operation in glass-blowing can be carried out in a perfectly leisurely  manner, and it is better to err rather on the side of deliberation than  on the side of haste.    If, as will doubtless happen at times, a piece of work gives trouble and  it is necessary to pause and consider the whole question, or if for any  other reason it is necessary to stop during the construction of a  partially finished join or other operation, great care should be taken  not to allow the work to cool. A large, brush-like flame may be produced  by increasing the amount of gas admitted to the blowpipe, and the work  should be held just in front of the current of hot air produced by such  a flame.    It will then be possible to continue work on this without causing it to  crack when further heat is applied.    As time goes on, the student will find an increasing confidence in his  ability to manipulate the soft glass, and with increasing confidence  will come rapidly increasing power of manipulation. Perhaps the greatest  obstacle to success in glass-blowing is undue haste in manipulation.          INDEX      Absorption bulbs, 21, 23.    Airtube, flexible, 8, 102.    Alarm thermometer, 45.
