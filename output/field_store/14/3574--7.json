The countess, who played the part  of the true mother in the Bible, had the case so much to heart that she  often told the judges, when pleading her cause, that if her son were not  recognised as such, she would marry him, and convey all her property to  him.    The young Count de la Palice became Count de Saint-Geran through the  death of his father, married, in 1667, Claude Francoise Madeleine de  Farignies, only daughter of Francois de Monfreville and of Marguerite  Jourdain de Carbone de Canisi. He had only one daughter, born in 1688,  who became a nun. He died at the age of fifty-five years, and thus this  illustrious family became extinct.                                            ----"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"observations and  specialized knowledge is very helpful as we try to produce the best  possible publications.

Answers to many frequently asked questions (FAQs) are explained in the  Notes and Definitions section in The World Factbook. Please review this  section to see if your question is already answered there. In addition,  we have compiled the following list of FAQs to answer other common  questions. Select from the following categories to narrow your search:    General  Geography  Spelling and Pronunciation  Policies and Procedures  Technical      General    Can you provide additional information for a specific country?    The staff cannot provide data beyond what appears in The World  Factbook. The format and information in the Factbook are tailored to  the specific requirements of US Government officials and content is  focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes  suggestions for new entries.    How often is The World Factbook updated?    Formerly our Web site (and the published Factbook) were only updated  annually. Beginning in November 2001 we instituted a new system of more  frequent online updates.    The annual printed version of the Factbook is usually released about  midyear. US Government officials may obtain information about Factbook  availability from their own organizations or through liaison channels  to the CIA. Other users may obtain sales information through the  following channels:    Superintendent of Documents  P. O. Box 371954 Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954  Telephone: [1] (202) 512-1800  FAX: [1] (202) 512-2250  http://www.bookstore.gpo.gov    National Technical Information Service  5285 Port Royal Road Springfield, VA 22161  Telephone: [1] (800) 553-6847 (only in the US);  [1] (703) 605-6000 (for outside US)  FAX: [1] (703) 605-6900  http://www.ntis.gov    Can I use some or all of The World Factbook for my Web site (book,  research project, homework, etc.)?    The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by  anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code  prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA  approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. If you have any questions  about your intended use, you should consult with legal counsel. Further  information on The World Factbook's use is described on the  Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a courtesy, please cite  The World Factbook when used.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,  departments, provinces, the European Union, etc., in the country  format?    The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,  territories, and dependencies, but not on subnational administrative  units within a country or supranational entities like the European  Union. A good encyclopedia should provide state/province-level  information.    Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Only the current version is available for browsing on the CIA Web site.  The year 2000 and 2001 editions are available for download. In the  future, the staff hopes to post electronic versions of The World  Factbook as far back as 1986. Hardcopy editions for earlier years are  available from libraries.    Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration between  the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations or  individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.      Geography    I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of places,  usually with descriptive or statistical information) and cannot provide  more than the names of the administrative divisions (in the Government  category) and major cities/towns (on the country maps). Our expanded  Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names, however, includes many of the  world's major geographic features as well as historic (former) names of  countries and cities mentioned in The World Factbook.    Why is Taiwan listed out of alphabetical order at the end of the  Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the  mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese  authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland  sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations with  China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the People's  Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging  the Chinese position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is  part of China.    Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican, why  is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to the  authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his  advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See has a  legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the  juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic  representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer properties  belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under international  law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or receive diplomatic  representatives. Consequently, Holy See is included as a Factbook  entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in the Geographic Names  appendix.    Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United States  Government are not shown on US Government maps.    Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet, Kashmir,  or Kosovo?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative divisions  of a country as recommended by the United States Board on Geographic  Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government that develops  policies, principles, and procedures governing the spelling, use, and  application of geographic names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and  undersea. Its decisions enable all departments and agencies of the US  Government to have access to uniform names of geographic features.    Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world whose  status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly Islands).  Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute among countries  are not covered.      Spelling and Pronunciation    Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling in  my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs of  State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared using  the standard American English computer keyboard and does not use any  special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in its  spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters; they may  appear first in some cultures.    The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative  divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my country.  Why is this?    The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and  approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic names--  domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to use uniform names of  geographic features. (A note is usually included where changes may have  occurred but have not yet been approved by the BGN). The World Factbook  is prepared using the standard American English computer keyboard and  does not use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical  markings in its spellings.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or  leader names?    There are too many variations in pronunciation among English-speaking  countries, not to mention English renditions of non-English names, for  pronunciations to be included. American English pronunciations are  included for some countries like Qatar and Kiribati.    Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?  When American and British spellings of common English words differ, The  World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when these  common words form part of a proper name in British English.      Policies and Procedures    What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?    The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we judge  are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular category.  Space considerations preclude a listing of these various sources.    The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook differ  from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia the  Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other publications  Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan whereas other  publications label it East Sea. What is you policy on naming geographic  features?    The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United States  Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing  the spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,  foreign,"]]]
