It grows both in  woodlands and in former pastures, but chiefly along the line of  contact. After removal of livestock in early 1949, crab-apple spread  into the edges of hilltop pastures, from the adjacent protected  woodland. Each year thickets of encroaching crab-apple have extended  farther into the fields, until, in 1955, there were graded series from  the trees along the fence, six feet high or more, to the seedlings 30  to 50 feet out in the fields. Dogwood, red haw, and smooth sumac are  among the most common associates of crab-apple as they share its  tendency to invade open land adjacent to the forest.    Evidently the tree is intolerant of browsing by livestock, as few were  growing in the pastured areas in 1948, but as soon as livestock were  removed these areas were rapidly invaded.    The thickets formed by crab-apple provide shelter for many kinds of  animals. Cottontails, especially, tend to stay in or near these  thickets. In autumn the fruits are eaten by them, and in winter, when  the ground is covered with snow, the bark is a major food source. Most  mature or partly grown trees show old scars near their bases, where  the rabbits have attacked them. Often the trees are completely  girdled. In years when snow lies on the ground for long periods  girdling is extensive and a substantial portion of the trees in the  thickets may be killed, but this mortality has been insufficient to  check the rapid spread of crab-apple.    The crab-apple is one of the trees preferred as a nesting site by the  cardinal. Other birds that frequently use the crab-apple tree as a  nest site include the field sparrow, towhee and indigo bunting.  White-footed mice, prairie voles and pine voles eat the fruit and  seed.      #Crataegus mollis.#--Red haw occurs over much of the Reservation, both  in woodland and former pastures. The trees are scattered, and are not  dominant, even on small areas. In the woodland, haw usually grows in  the more open situations. Where there are haws in denser woods, they  are usually large and old; seemingly they are survivors from a time  when the woods were more open. Haw is intolerant of shading, and being  of lesser height than any of the climax species, it cannot compete  with them. The present wide distribution of haw on the area is  secondary, resulting from the extensive cutting of the larger trees  and opening up of the woodland. Haw trees are most numerous on south  facing slopes that have grown up into thickets in the last 30 years.  Here its associates are chiefly honey locust, osage orange, dogwood  and elm.    Red haws have been recorded as nest trees of horned owls,  yellow-billed cuckoos, cardinals, and fox squirrels. Cavities in the  trunks are used by downy woodpeckers, titmice, chickadees and  white-footed mice.      #Cercis canadensis.#--Redbud is abundant in some parts of the  woodland. Trees are up to nine inches in diameter and 25 feet high.  They grow chiefly in rich soil on hillsides in moist situations.  Redbud and dogwood are in part complementary in distribution, each  forming an understory in parts of the woodland where the leaf canopy  of larger trees is not too dense. However, redbud is more tolerant of  shade. In general dogwood grows in the drier, more rocky situations  and redbud in better soil and damper sites. In the southeastern part  of the Reservation, on a west facing slope, redbud dominates, with  smaller numbers of elm, blackjack oak, and dogwood.    Several times nests of yellow-billed cuckoos were found in redbuds.  Titmice, chickadees, and red-eyed vireos forage in redbuds on many  occasions. Brown creepers forage on the trunks. Titmice, chickadees,  and downy woodpeckers used cavities in dead or dying redbuds. However,  there is no evidence that this tree is especially attractive to any  kind of vertebrate, or plays an important part in the ecology of the  area.      #Gymnocladus dioica.#--Kentucky coffee-tree is one of the less  important trees on the area but it is widely distributed. In general  it is absent from the denser woods. On limited areas of certain slopes  it is the dominant species. The groves sometimes are in nearly pure  stands. Slope exposure evidently is not the determining factor in the  local distribution as groves have been found on hillsides of varying  exposure. The tree seems to flourish where the forest has been opened  by cutting of the larger trees. Groves are mainly on the more gently  sloping parts of the hillsides, or on the nearly level terrace. There  are few coffee-trees more than 12 inches in trunk diameter. The  largest tree examined was 27 inches.    In May, groups of orchard orioles (_Icterus spurius_) have been  observed in coffee-trees, seemingly attracted by the blossoms. These  concentrations never lasted more than a few days and seemed to involve  individuals that were still migrating or newly arrived and not yet  established on their territories.    In winter the large pods of this tree are used as food to a limited  extent by cottontails. The large hard shelled seeds resist attack by  most animals. Seemingly they are used by white-footed mice, as they  have often been found stored in the nest cavities of these mice,  beneath rocks or in logs.      #Gleditsia triacanthos.#--Honey locust is at present one of the more  important species of trees on the area. There are scattered locusts  throughout most parts of the woodland. In the bottomland fields there  are groves and scattered trees of medium to large size. On south  slopes honey locust, osage orange and red elm form thickets. On  hilltops, along woodland edges where fences were installed in the  mid-thirties, young honey locusts have become established and are now  abundant. Some have grown to a diameter of 8 inches or more. Honey  locust is the fastest growing of the trees on the area and therefore  has an early advantage in competing with other kinds. A locust of  25-inch diameter cut in 1950 was found to have 32 annual rings, an  average of only 1.3 rings per inch as contrasted with an average of  3.8 for all the trees studied, and more than 9 for some of the slowest  growing. In open fields, both those used for pasture and those  formerly cultivated, young honey locusts have sprung up in abundance  since the discontinuance of grazing in 1948. The species is resistant  to drought. It seems to have been limited on the area mainly by  grazing and shading. The locusts growing in the woods tend to be  concentrated near its edges. Those that are deeper in woodland  evidently became established after heavy tree-cutting had opened  clearings. Locusts in such situations, competing with other hardwoods  are of much different form than those growing in the open; the trunks  are long and slender and the crowns are narrow.    The south slopes that were originally prairie, were evidently only  sparsely clothed with trees up until the thirties when livestock were  fenced out. Then the abundant growth of shrubs and young trees formed  thickets. Honey locust, growing rapidly tended to dominate. The  younger locust saplings that were shaded beneath the leaf canopy died  in large numbers.    Honey locust plays an important part in the over-all ecology of the  area, providing both food and shelter for many kinds of animals. The  foliage is well liked by livestock; consequently young trees have  little chance of surviving in heavily grazed pastures. Rabbits like  both the foliage, and the bark. Often they girdle or injure young  trees, and eat the beans. Both the prairie vole and the pine vole  often feed upon the inner bark and root crowns of small saplings,  sometimes completely undermining them. These voles also store and eat  the seeds. Beneath large mature locusts, runway systems and burrows  of the pine vole are sometimes much in evidence. As ground vegetation  is scanty in these places it seems that the voles are attracted by the  abundant supply of locust seeds.    The spiny branches of locusts provide well protected nesting sites  that are utilized by various kinds of birds; mourning dove, horned  owl, yellow-billed cuckoo, gnatcatcher, cardinal and goldfinch have  been recorded nesting in locusts. The wood is relatively soft. The  hairy woodpecker has been recorded nesting in a cavity which it had  dug in a living honey locust, while the black-capped chickadee and  red-bellied woodpecker have been recorded nesting in cavities in dead  limbs. The summer tanager prefers large locusts near the edge of  woodland as singing stations.    Fox squirrels also often exploit the spiny protection provided by  locust trunks, and build their stick nests in these trees, usually in  a fork of the main trunk eight to twelve feet above the ground. Such  nest trees often are either isolated or are in groves of other  locusts. Presumably the squirrels are attracted to them by the supply  of locust seeds.      #Acer Negundo.#--Boxelder probably was not a part of the original  flora of the Reservation. The trees present now are few and scattered,  and most are not more than eight inches in trunk diameter. The species  seems intolerant of shade and does not grow in the denser woodlands. A  few are present along the banks of the intermittent streams, and there  are others in open woodlands of south slopes. The small patch of  bluestem prairie remaining at the northwest corner of the Reservation  is being invaded by a variety of shrubs and saplings, and boxelder is  by far the most prominent of these invaders, with two hundred  seedlings and saplings per acre.      #Ailanthus altissima.#--Tree-of-heaven is an Asiatic species that was  introduced early into northeastern Kansas, and has become established"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34376"],[0,"Our Domestic Birds: Elementary Lessons in Aviculture (#11)"],[1," Asiatics met this  requirement, but the former were too small and their combs were  unnecessarily large, while the latter were larger fowls than were  desired for general use, and their foot feathering was a handicap in  barnyards and on heavy, wet soils.    [Illustration: Fig. 44. Barred Plymouth Rock hen. (Photograph from  Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]    So, while fanciers and those who were willing to give their poultry  special attention, or who kept fowls for some special purpose which one  of the foreign breeds suited, took these breeds up eagerly, farmers and  other poultry keepers usually became interested in them only to the  extent of using male birds of different breeds to cross with flocks of  native and grade hens. In consequence of this promiscuous crossing, the  stock in the country rapidly changed, a new type of mongrel replacing  the old native stock.    While the masses of poultry keepers were thus crossing new and old  stock at random, many breeders were trying systematically to produce a  new breed that would meet all the popular requirements. Even before the  days of the hen fever two local breeds had arisen, probably by accident.  These were the Jersey Blue and the Bucks County Fowl, both of which  continued down to our own time but never became popular. At the first  exhibition in Boston a class had been provided for crossbred fowls, and  in this was shown a new variety called the Plymouth Rock. From the  descriptions of these birds now in existence it appears that they looked  much like the modern Partridge Plymouth Rock. Those who brought them out  hoped that they would meet the popular demand, and for a short time it  seemed that this hope might be realized, but interest in them soon  waned, and in a few years they were almost forgotten.    [Illustration: Fig. 45. White Plymouth Rock hen (Photograph from C. E.  Hodgkins, Northampton, Massachusetts)]    In the light of the history of American breeds which did afterwards  become popular we can see now that the ideas of the masses of American  poultry keepers were not as strictly practical as their objections to  the various foreign breeds appeared to show. The three varieties that  have just been mentioned, and many others arising from time to time, met  all the expressed requirements of the practical poultry keeper quite as  well as those which subsequently caught his fancy. Indeed, as will be  shown farther on, some of the productions of this period, after being  neglected for a long time, finally became very popular. Usually this  happened when their color became fashionable.    =The modern Barred Plymouth Rock.= Shortly after our Civil War two  poultrymen in Connecticut--one a fancier, the other a farmer--engaged in  a joint effort to produce the business type of fowl that would meet the  favor of American farmers. A male of the old Dominique type was crossed  with some Black Cochin hens. This mating produced some chickens having  the color of the sire, but larger and more robust. Another and more  skillful fancier saw these chickens and persuaded the farmer to sell him  a few of the best. A few years later, when, by careful breeding and  selection, he had fixed the type and had specimens enough to supply eggs  to other fanciers, he took some of his new breed to a show at Worcester,  Massachusetts. Up to this time he had not thought of a name for them,  but as people who saw them would want to know what they were called, a  name was now necessary. It occurred to this man that the name \"Plymouth  Rock,\" having once been given to a promising American breed, would be  appropriate. So the birds were exhibited as Plymouth Rocks.    [Illustration: Fig. 46. Buff Plymouth Rock cock]    This new breed caught the popular fancy at once, for it had the color  which throughout this country was supposed always to be associated with  exceptional vigor and productiveness, and it had greater size than the  Dominique. The fame of the new breed spread rapidly. It was impossible  to supply the demand from the original stock, and, as there is usually  more than one way of producing a type by crossing, good imitations of  the original were soon abundant. Farmers and market poultrymen by  thousands took up the Plymouth Rock, while all over the land fanciers  were trying to perfect the color which their critical taste found very  poor.    [Illustration: Fig. 47. Silver-Penciled Plymouth Rock hen]    =Other varieties of the Plymouth Rock.= The success of the Plymouth Rock  gave fresh impetus to efforts to make new breeds and varieties of the  same general character. Great as was its popularity, the new breed did  not suit all. Some did not like the color; some objected to the single  comb, thinking that a rose comb or a pea comb had advantages; some  preferred a shorter, blockier body; others wanted a larger, longer body.  The off-colored birds which new races usually produce in considerable  numbers, even when the greater number come quite true, also suggested to  some who obtained them new varieties of the Plymouth Rock, while to  others it seemed better policy to give them new names and exploit them  as new and distinct breeds.    Both black and white specimens came often in the early flocks of Barred  Plymouth Rocks. The black ones were developed as a distinct breed,  called the Black Java. The white ones, after going for a while under  various names, and after strong opposition from those who claimed that  the name \"Plymouth Rock\" belonged exclusively to birds of the color with  which the name had become identified, finally secured recognition as  White Plymouth Rocks. Almost immediately Buff Plymouth Rocks appeared.  For reasons which will appear later, the origin of these will be given  in another connection. Then came in rapid succession the  Silver-Penciled, the Partridge, or Golden-Penciled (which, as has been  said, is probably quite a close duplicate of the type to which the name  \"Plymouth Rock\" was originally given), and the Columbian, or Ermine,  Plymouth Rock. These were all of the general type of the Barred variety,  but because in most cases they were made by different combinations, and  because fanciers are much more particular to breed for color than to  breed for typical form, the several varieties of the Plymouth Rock are  slightly different in form.    [Illustration: Fig. 48. Silver-Laced Wyandotte pullet. Photographed in  position showing lacing on back]    [Illustration: Fig. 49. Silver-Laced Wyandotte cockerel]    =The Wyandottes.= Closely following the appearance of the Barred  Plymouth Rock came the Silver-Laced Wyandotte, called at first simply  the Wyandotte. The original type was quite different in color from the  modern type. It had on each feather a small white center surrounded by  a heavy black lacing. This has been gradually changed until now the  white center is large and the black edging narrow. At first some of  these Wyandottes had rose combs and some had single combs. The rose comb  was preferred and the single-combed birds were discarded as culls.    Strange as it seems in the case of an event so recent, no one knows  where the first Wyandottes came from. It is supposed that they were one  of the many varieties developed either by chance or in an effort to meet  the demand for a general-purpose fowl. They appear to have come into the  hands of those who first exploited them in some way that left no trace  of their source. They went under several different names until 1883,  when the name \"Wyandotte\" was given them as an appropriate and  euphonious name for an American breed.    [Illustration: Fig. 50. White Wyandotte cockerel. (Photograph from W. E.  Mack, Woodstock, Vermont)]    Next appeared a Golden-Laced Wyandotte, marked like the Silver-Laced  variety but having golden bay where that had white. This variety was  developed from an earlier variety of unknown origin, known in Southern  Wisconsin and Northern Illinois (about 1870 and earlier) under the name  of \"Winnebago.\"    The Silver-Laced Wyandottes, like the Barred Plymouth Rocks, produced  some black and some white specimens. From these were made the Black  Wyandottes and the White Wyandottes. Then came the Buff Wyandottes  (from the same original source as the Buff Plymouth Rocks), and after  them Partridge Wyandottes, Silver-Penciled Wyandottes, and Columbian, or  Ermine, Wyandottes. From the three last-named varieties came the  Plymouth Rock varieties of the corresponding colors, the first stocks of  these being the single-combed specimens from the flocks of breeders of  these varieties of Wyandottes.    [Illustration: Fig. 51. Silver-Penciled Wyandotte cockerel. (Photograph  from James S. Wason, Grand Rapids, Michigan)]    [Illustration: Fig. 52. Partridge Wyandotte pullet]    =The Rhode Island Red.= Among the earliest of the local types developed  in America was a red fowl which soon became the prevalent type in the  egg-farming section of Rhode Island and quite popular in the adjacent  part of Massachusetts. Most of the stock of this race was produced by a  continuous process of grading and crossing which was systematic only in  that it was the common practice to preserve none but the red males after  introducing a cross of another color. A few breeders in the district  bred their flocks more carefully than others, but the race as a whole  was not really thoroughbred until after it became more widely popular.    Although the formation of this race began about 1850 (perhaps earlier),  it was fifty years before it became known outside of the limited area in  which it was almost the only type to be seen. Indeed, the first birds of  this race to attract the attention of the public were exhibited about  1890 as Buff Plymouth Rocks and Buff Wyandottes. At that time very few  of the Rhode Island Reds were as dark in color as the average specimen  now seen in the showroom, and buff specimens were numerous. Birds with  "]]]
