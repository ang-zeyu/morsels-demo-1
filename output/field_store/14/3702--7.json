But it'd be nice if it wasn't so cold. I'm  freezing.\"    \"I thought you loved cold air,\" taunted Helen.    \"Say, Nell, you begin to talk like yourself,\" responded Bo.    It was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak  all at once, but they succeeded, except in the roughest places, when  from time to time they were bounced around. Bo sustained a sharp rap on  the head.    \"Oooooo!\" she moaned. \"Nell Rayner, I'll never forgive you for fetching  me on this awful trip.\"    \"Just think of your handsome Las Vegas cowboy,\" replied Helen.    Either this remark subdued Bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile  her to the hardships of the ride.    Meanwhile, as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep, the  driver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of Western men who  knew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance.    By and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so  long, with the men whispering on top, that Helen and Bo were roused to  apprehension.    Suddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead.    \"Thet's Roy,\" said Joe Beeman, in a low voice.    \"I reckon. An' meetin' us so quick looks bad,\" replied Dale. \"Drive on,  Bill.\"    \"Mebbe it seems quick to you,\" muttered the driver, \"but if we hain't  come thirty mile, an' if thet ridge thar hain't your turnin'-off place,  why, I don't know nothin'.\"    The stage rolled on a little farther, while Helen and Bo sat clasping  each other tight, wondering with bated breath what was to be the next  thing to happen.    Then once more they were at a standstill. Helen heard the thud of boots  striking the ground, and the snorts of horses.    \"Nell, I see horses,\" whispered Bo, excitedly. \"There, to the side of  the road... and here comes a man.... Oh, if he shouldn't be the one  they're expecting!\"    Helen peered out to see a tall, dark form, moving silently, and beyond  it a vague outline of horses, and then pale gleams of what must have  been pack-loads.    Dale loomed up, and met the stranger in the road.    \"Howdy, Milt? You got the girl sure, or you wouldn't be here,\" said a  low voice.    \"Roy, I've got two girls--sisters,\" replied Dale.    The man Roy whistled softly under his breath. Then another lean, rangy  form strode out of the darkness, and was met by Dale.    \"Now, boys--how about Anson's gang?\" queried Dale.    \"At Snowdrop, drinkin' an' quarrelin'. Reckon they'll leave there about  daybreak,\" replied Roy.    \"How long have you been here?\"    \"Mebbe a couple of hours.\"    \"Any horse go by?\"    \"No.\"    \"Roy, a strange rider passed us before dark. He was hittin' the road.  An' he's got by here before you came.\"    \"I don't like thet news,\" replied Roy, tersely. \"Let's rustle. With  girls on hossback you'll need all the start you can get. Hey, John?\"    \"Snake Anson shore can foller hoss tracks,\" replied the third man.    \"Milt, say the word,\" went on Roy, as he looked up at the stars.  \"Daylight not far away. Here's the forks of the road, an' your hosses,  an' our outfit. You can be in the pines by sunup.\"    In the silence that ensued Helen heard the throb of her heart and  the panting little breaths of her sister. They both peered out, hands  clenched together, watching and listening in strained attention.    \"It's possible that rider last night wasn't a messenger to Anson,\" said  Dale. \"In that case Anson won't make anythin' of our wheel tracks or  horse tracks. He'll go right on to meet the regular stage. Bill, can you  go back an' meet the stage comin' before Anson does?\"    \"Wal, I reckon so--an' take it easy at thet,\" replied Bill.    \"All right,\" continued Dale, instantly. \"John, you an' Joe an' Hal ride  back to meet the regular stage. An' when you meet it get on an' be on it  when Anson holds it up.\"    \"Thet's shore agreeable to me,\" drawled John.    \"I'd like to be on it, too,\" said Roy, grimly.    \"No. I'll need you till I'm safe in the woods. Bill, hand down the bags.  An' you, Roy, help me pack them. Did you get all the supplies I wanted?\"    \"Shore did. If the young ladies ain't powerful particular you can feed  them well for a couple of months.\"    Dale wheeled and, striding to the stage, he opened the door.    \"Girls, you're not asleep? Come,\" he called.    Bo stepped down first.    \"I was asleep till this--this vehicle fell off the road back a ways,\"  she replied.    Roy Beeman's low laugh was significant. He took off his sombrero and  stood silent. The old driver smothered a loud guffaw.    \"Veehicle! Wal, I'll be doggoned! Joe, did you hear thet? All the spunky  gurls ain't born out West.\"    As Helen followed with cloak and bag Roy assisted her, and she  encountered keen eyes upon her face. He seemed both gentle and  respectful, and she felt his solicitude. His heavy gun, swinging low,  struck her as she stepped down.    Dale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags. These he  set down on the ground.    \"Turn around, Bill, an' go along with you. John an' Hal will follow  presently,\" ordered Dale.    \"Wal, gurls,\" said Bill, looking down upon them, \"I was shore powerful  glad to meet you-all. An' I'm ashamed of my country--offerin' two sich  purty gurls insults an' low-down tricks. But shore you'll go through  safe now. You couldn't be in better company fer ridin' or huntin' or  marryin' or gittin' religion--\"    \"Shut up, you old grizzly!\" broke in Dale, sharply.    \"Haw! Haw! Good-by, gurls, an' good luck!\" ended Bill, as he began to  whip the reins.    Bo said good-by quite distinctly, but Helen could only murmur hers. The  old driver seemed a friend.    Then the horses wheeled and stamped, the stage careened and creaked,  presently to roll out of sight in the gloom.    \"You're shiverin',\" said Dale, suddenly, looking down upon Helen. She  felt his big, hard hand clasp hers. \"Cold as ice!\"    \"I am c-cold,\" replied Helen. \"I guess we're not warmly dressed.\"    \"Nell, we roasted all day, and now we're freezing,\" declared Bo. \"I  didn't know it was winter at night out here.\"    \"Miss, haven't you some warm gloves an' a coat?\" asked Roy, anxiously.  \"It 'ain't begun to get cold yet.\"    \"Nell, we've heavy gloves, riding-suits and boots--all fine and new--in  this black bag,\" said Bo, enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet.    \"Yes, so we have. But a lot of good they'll do us, to-night,\" returned  Helen.    \"Miss, you'd do well to change right here,\" said Roy, earnestly. \"It'll  save time in the long run an' a lot of sufferin' before sunup.\"    Helen stared at the young man, absolutely amazed with his simplicity.  She was advised to change her traveling-dress for a riding-suit--out  somewhere in a cold, windy desert--in the middle of the night--among  strange young men!    \"Bo, which bag is it?\" asked Dale, as if she were his sister. And when  she indicated the one, he picked it up. \"Come off the road.\"    Bo followed him, and Helen found herself mechanically at their heels.  Dale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes.    \"Hurry an' change here,\" he said. \"We'll make a pack of your outfit an'  leave room for this bag.\"    Then he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared.    Bo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes. Helen could just see her pale,  pretty face and big, gleaming eyes by the light of the stars. It struck  her then that Bo was going to make eminently more of a success of  Western life than she was.    \"Nell, those fellows are n-nice,\" said Bo, reflectively. \"Aren't you  c-cold? Say, he said hurry!\"    It was beyond Helen's comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out  there in that open, windy desert, but after she had gotten launched on  the task she found that it required more fortitude than courage. The  cold wind pierced right through her. Almost she could have laughed at  the way Bo made things fly.    \"G-g-g-gee!\" chattered Bo. \"I n-never w-was so c-c-cold in all my life.  Nell Rayner, m-may the g-good Lord forgive y-you!\"    Helen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk. She was  a strong, healthy girl, swift and efficient with her hands, yet this,  the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced, almost overcame  her. Bo outdistanced her by moments, helped her with buttons, and laced  one whole boot for her. Then, with hands that stung, Helen packed the  traveling-suits in the bag.    \"There! But what an awful mess!\" exclaimed Helen. \"Oh, Bo, our pretty  traveling-dresses!\"    \"We'll press them t-to-morrow--on a l-log,\" replied Bo, and she giggled.    They started for the road. Bo, strange to note, did not carry her share  of the burden, and she seemed unsteady on her feet.    The men were waiting beside a group of horses, one of which carried a  pack.    \"Nothin' slow about you,\" said Dale, relieving Helen of the grip. \"Roy,  put them up while I sling on this bag.\"    Roy led out two of the horses.    \"Get up,\" he said, indicating Bo. \"The stirrups are short on this  saddle.\"    Bo was an adept at mounting, but she made such awkward and slow work of  it in this instance that Helen could not believe her eyes.    \"Haw 're the stirrups?\" asked Roy. \"Stand in them. Guess they're about  right.... Careful now! Thet hoss is skittish. Hold him in.\"    Bo was not living up to the reputation with which Helen had credited  her.    \"Now, miss, you get up,\" said Roy to Helen. And in another instant she  found herself astride a black, spirited horse. Numb with cold as she  was, she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins.    Roy was at the stirrups with swift hands.    \"You're taller 'n I guessed,\" he said. \"Stay up, but lift your foot....  Shore now, I'm glad you have them thick, soft boots. Mebbe we'll ride  all over the White Mountains.\"    \"Bo, do you hear that?\" called Helen.    But Bo did not answer.

And they did feast, and then they went away.    The Pine Tree had found out his mission. He had helped to save three  lives.    In the summer there came along a band of explorers, and one, the  botanist of the party, stopped beside our Pine Tree:    \"This,\" said he in his big words, \"is the Pinus Monophyllus, otherwise  known as the Bread Pine.\" He looked at the deserted hut and passed his  hand over his forehead.    \"How strange it is,\" said he. \"This Pine Tree must have kept a whole  family from cold and starvation last winter. There are very few of us  who have done as much good as that.\" And when he went away, he waved  his hand to the tree and thanked God in his heart that it grew there.  And the Bread Pine waved his branches in return, and said to himself  as he gazed after the departing band: \"I will never complain again,  for I have found out what a pleasant thing it is to do good, and I  know now that every one in his lifetime can do a little of it.\"          A WONDERFUL WEAVER          There's a wonderful weaver        High up in the air,      And he weaves a white mantle        For cold earth to wear.

Oh, with finest of laces,        He decks bush and tree;      On the bare, flinty meadows        A cover lays he.      Then a quaint cap he places        On pillar and post,      And he changes the pump        To a grim, silent ghost.        But this wonderful weaver        Grows weary at last;      And the shuttle lies idle        That once flew so fast.

THE PINE AND THE FLAX    Albrekt Segerstedt      Just where a forest ended grew a pine tree taller and more beautiful  than all the others in the forest. Far away could be seen its feathery  round crown, whose soft branches waved so gracefully when the wind  blew across the plain.    At the foot of the pine tree the fields of grain began.    Here the farmer sowed seeds of many kinds, but the flax was sowed  nearest the pine. It came up beautiful and even, and the pine thought  a great deal of the slender green thing.    The flax stalk raised itself higher and higher, and near the close of  summer it bore a little blue helmet on his head.    \"Thou art so beautiful!\" said the tall pine.    The flax bowed itself low, but raised again so gracefully that it  looked like a billowy sea.    The pine and the flax often talked to each other and became great  friends.    \"What folly!\" said the other forest trees to the pine. \"Do not have  anything to do with the flax; it is so weak. Choose the tall spruce or  the birch tree. They are strong.\"    But the pine would not desert the flax.    The thistle and other small plants talked to the flax.    \"You are crazy to think of the lofty pine. It does not trouble itself  about you. It is tall and proud. Children of a size play best  together. Think of the bush and vine and content yourself.\"    \"I shall trust the pine,\" replied the flax. \"It is honourable and  faithful and I am fond of it.\"    So the pine and the flax remained friends.    Time passed and the flax was pulled up and made into ropes and cloth.  The pine was felled and its trunk carried to the city. But the pine  and flax did not forget each other, though neither knew where the  other was.    A large, beautiful ship was launched upon the water. On this the pine  tree was erected as a mast, and on the highest part waved a flag.    Then came a great white sail to help the mast carry the proud ship  forward. It wrapped itself around the mast, spread itself out like a  great wing, and caught the wind on its wide curve.    The sail had been woven of linen that grew as flax out in the field on  the edge of the wood. And the two friends had met again.    Clasping each other faithfully, out over the foaming billows they went  to new lands. It was life, it was pleasure to go on united as friends.    The winds took a message back to the forest.    \"Who would have believed it?\" said the spruce and the birch.

Replies the wind:        \"I cannot find      Flowers, to kiss awake,      Or dewy grass to shake,        Or feathered seed        Aloft to speed;          Yet I meet        Something sweet,      When the scented fir,--        Balsam-breathing fir--        In my flight I stir.\"                            Edith M. Thomas.          WHY BRUIN HAS A STUMPY TAIL    (Norwegian Legend)      Once upon a time a sly fox lived in a deep forest which bordered a  river. One fine winter day he was lying in the sun near a brush heap  with his eyes closed, and he was thinking: \"It has been several days  since I had a dainty supper. How I should enjoy a fine large fish this  evening. I'll slip over to the edge of the forest and watch the  fishermen as they go home with their day's catch. Perhaps good luck  will do something for me.\"    Now one old man had caught a very fine lot of fish of all sizes.  Indeed, he had so many that he was obliged to hire a cart in which to  carry them home. He was driving along slowly when suddenly he noticed  a red fox crouched under the bush near the road. He stopped his horse,  jumped down from the cart, and carefully crept near the spot where he  had seen Master Reynard. The fox did not open his eyes nor move a  muscle.    \"Well,\" said the old fisherman, \"I do believe he is dead! What a fine  coat he has. I will take him home and give him to my wife for a  present.\" He lifted the fox and put him into the cart among the fish.  The old man then mounted to his seat and drove merrily on, thinking  how pleased his wife would be with the fine fish and the fox. When  they were well on their way, the sly fox threw one fish after another  out of the cart until all lay scattered along on the road; then he  slipped out of the cart.    When the old man reached his cottage, he called out to his wife, \"Come  and see the fine fish I caught to-day. And I have brought you a  beautiful gift, also.\"    His wife hurried to the cart and said, \"Where are the fish, my  husband, and where is my present?\"    \"Why, there in the cart,\" he replied.    \"In the cart!\" exclaimed his wife. \"Why, there is nothing here;  neither fish nor present, so far as I can see.\"    The old man looked and to his great surprise and disappointment he  discovered that what his wife said was true.    Meanwhile, the sly fox had gathered up the fish and had taken them to  the forest in order to enjoy a fine supper. Presently he heard a  pleasant voice saying, \"Good evening, Brother Reynard.\"    He looked up and saw his friend Bruin. \"Oh, good evening to you,\"  answered the fox. \"I have been fishing to-day, and, as you see, luck  certainly attended me.\"    \"It did, indeed,\" answered the bear. \"Could you not spare me one fish?  I should consider the gift a great favor.\"    \"Oh,\" answered the fox, \"why don't you go fishing yourself? I assure  you when one becomes a fisherman, he thoroughly enjoys the fruits of  patience.\"    \"Go fishing, my friend,\" said Bruin, in astonishment. \"That is  impossible. I know nothing about catching fish, I assure you.\"    \"Pooh, it is very easy, especially in the winter time when ice nearly  covers the river. Let me tell you what to do. Make a hole in the ice  and stick your tail down into it. Hold it there just as long as you  can and keep saying, 'Come, little fish; come, big fish.' Don't mind  if the tail smarts a little; that only means that you have a bite, and  I assure you the longer you hold it there the more fish you will  catch. Then all at once, out with your tail. Give a strong pull  sideways, then upward, and you'll have enough fish to last you several  days. But mind you, follow my directions closely.\"    \"Oh, my friend, I am very grateful for your kind information,\" said  Bruin, and off he went to the river where he proceeded to follow  Master Fox's directions.    In a short time sly Reynard passed by, and when he saw Bruin patiently  sitting on the ice with his tail in a hole, he laughed until his sides  ached. He said, wickedly, under his breath: \"A clear sky, a clear sky!  Bruin's tail will freeze, Bruin's tail will freeze.\"    \"What did you say, my friend?\" asked the bear.    \"Oh, I was making a wish,\" replied the fox.    All night long Bruin sat there, fishing patiently. Then he decided to  go home. How very heavy his tail felt. He thought to himself that all  the fish in the river must be fastened there. In a little while the  women of the village came to get water from the river, and when they  saw the bear, they called out at the top of their voices: \"Come, come!  A bear, a bear! Kill him! Kill him!\"    The men came quickly with great sticks in their hands. Poor Bruin gave  a short pull sideways and his tail snapped off short. He made off to  the woods as fast as he could go, but to this day he goes about with a  stumpy tail.          PINES AND FIRS    Mrs. Dyson      Pines and firs! Who knows the difference between a pine and a fir!  These trees are first cousins; they often dwell together in our woods;  they are evergreen; they have narrow, pointed leaves; and they bear  cones, and so we often call them all firs, as if they were brothers.  This may satisfy strangers and passers-by who only turn their heads  and say: \"Ah! a fir wood,\" but it will not be sufficient for the  friends of the trees. Pines and firs are as different as oaks and  beeches; and who would not be ashamed to"]]]
