After the resurrection            They who earliest saw Jesus after the resurrection          and beheld the final proof of all that he had taught,  45:24   misconstrued that event. Even his disciples          at first called him a spirit, ghost, or spectre,          for they believed his body to be dead. His reply was:  45:27   \"Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"          The reappearing of Jesus was not the return of a spirit.          He presented the same body that he had before his cru-  45:30   cifixion, and so glorified the supremacy of Mind over          matter.            Jesus' students, not sufficiently advanced fully to un-  46:1    derstand their Master's triumph, did not perform many          wonderful works, until they saw him after his crucifixion  46:3    and learned that he had not died. This convinced them          of the truthfulness of all that he had taught.                            Spiritual interpretation            In the walk to Emmaus, Jesus was known to his friends  46:6    by the words, which made their hearts burn within them,          and by the breaking of bread. The divine          Spirit, which identified Jesus thus centuries  46:9    ago, has spoken through the inspired Word and will speak          through it in every age and clime. It is revealed to the          receptive heart, and is again seen casting out evil and  46:12   healing the sick.                             Corporeality and Spirit            The Master said plainly that physique was not Spirit,          and after his resurrection he proved to the physical senses  46:15   that his body was not changed until he himself          ascended, - or, in other words, rose even          higher in the understanding of Spirit, God. To convince  46:18   Thomas of this, Jesus caused him to examine the nail-          prints and the spear-wound.                               Spiritual ascension            Jesus' unchanged physical condition after what seemed  46:21   to be death was followed by his exaltation above all ma-          terial conditions; and this exaltation explained          his ascension, and revealed unmistakably a  46:24   probationary and progressive state beyond the grave.          Jesus was \"the way;\" that is, he marked the way for          all men. In his final demonstration, called the ascen-  46:27   sion, which closed the earthly record of Jesus, he rose          above the physical knowledge of his disciples, and the          material senses saw him no more.                                Pentecostal power    46:30   His students then received the Holy Ghost. By this is          meant, that by all they had witnessed and suffered, they          were roused to an enlarged understanding of divine Sci-  47:1    ence, even to the spiritual interpretation and discernment          of Jesus' teachings and demonstrations, which gave them  47:3    a faint conception of the Life which is God.          They no longer measured man by material          sense. After gaining the true idea of their glorified Master,  47:6    they became better healers, leaning no longer on matter,          but on the divine Principle of their work. The influx of          light was sudden. It was sometimes an overwhelming  47:9    power as on the Day of Pentecost.                            The traitor's conspiracy            Judas conspired against Jesus. The world's ingratitude          and hatred towards that just man effected his betrayal.  47:12   The traitor's price was thirty pieces of silver          and the smiles of the Pharisees. He chose his          time, when the people were in doubt concerning Jesus'  47:15   teachings.            A period was approaching which would reveal the in-          finite distance between Judas and his Master. Judas  47:18   Iscariot knew this. He knew that the great goodness of          that Master placed a gulf between Jesus and his betrayer,          and this spiritual distance inflamed Judas' envy. The  47:21   greed for gold strengthened his ingratitude, and for a time          quieted his remorse. He knew that the world generally          loves a lie better than Truth; and so he plotted the be-  47:24   trayal of Jesus in order to raise himself in popular esti-          mation. His dark plot fell to the ground, and the          traitor fell with it.  47:27   The disciples' desertion of their Master in his last          earthly struggle was punished; each one came to a vio-          lent death except St. John, of whose death we have no  47:30   record.                              Gethsemane glorified            During his night of gloom and glory in the garden,          Jesus realized the utter error of a belief in any possi-  48:1    ble material intelligence. The pangs of neglect and the          staves of bigoted ignorance smote him sorely. His stu-  48:3    dents slept. He said unto them: \"Could Ye          not watch with me one hour?\" Could they          not watch with him who, waiting and struggling in voice-  48:6    less agony, held uncomplaining guard over a world?          There was no response to that human yearning, and so          Jesus turned forever away from earth to heaven, from  48:9    sense to Soul.            Remembering the sweat of agony which fell in holy          benediction on the grass of Gethsemane, shall the hum-  48:12   blest or mightiest disciple murmur when he drinks from the          same cup, and think, or even wish, to escape the exalt-          ing ordeal of sin's revenge on its destroyer? Truth and  48:15   Love bestow few palms until the consummation of a          life-work.                                Defensive weapons            Judas had the world's weapons. Jesus had not one  48:18   of them, and chose not the world's means of defence.          \"He opened not his mouth.\" The great dem-          onstrator of Truth and Love was silent before  48:21   envy and hate. Peter would have smitten the enemies of          his Master, but Jesus forbade him, thus rebuking re-          sentment or animal courage. He said: \"Put up thy  48:24   sword.\"                                Pilate's question            Pale in the presence of his own momentous question,          \"What is Truth,\" Pilate was drawn into acquiescence  48:27   with the demands of Jesus' enemies. Pilate          was ignorant of the consequences of his awful          decision against human rights and divine Love, knowing  48:30   not that he was hastening the final demonstration of what          life is and of what the true knowledge of God can do for          man.    49:1    The women at the cross could have answered Pilate's          question. They knew what had inspired their devotion,  49:3    winged their faith, opened the eyes of their understand-          ing, healed the sick, cast out evil, and caused the disciples          to say to their Master: \"Even the devils are subject  49:6    unto us through thy name.\"                              Students' ingratitude            Where were the seventy whom Jesus sent forth? Were          all conspirators save eleven? Had they forgotten the  49:9    great exponent of God? Had they so soon lost          sight of his mighty works, his toils, privations,          sacrifices, his divine patience, sublime courage, and unre-  49:12   quited affection? O, why did they not gratify his last          human yearning with one sign of fidelity?                                Heaven's sentinel            The meek demonstrator of good, the highest instruc-  49:15   tor and friend of man, met his earthly fate alone with          God. No human eye was there to pity, no          arm to save. Forsaken by all whom he had  49:18   blessed, this faithful sentinel of God at the highest          post of power, charged with the grandest trust of          heaven, was ready to be transformed by the renewing  49:21   of the infinite Spirit. He was to prove that the Christ          is not subject to material conditions, but is above the          reach of human wrath, and is able, through Truth,  49:24   Life, and Love, to triumph over sin, sickness, death, and          the grave.                                 Cruel contumely            The priests and rabbis, before whom he had meekly  49:27   walked, and those to whom he had given the highest          proofs of divine power, mocked him on the          cross, saying derisively, \"He saved others;  49:30   himself he cannot save.\" These scoffers, who turned          \"aside the right of a man before the face of the Most          High,\" esteemed Jesus as \"stricken, smitten of God.\"  50:1    \"He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep          before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\"  50:3    \"Who shall declare his generation?\" Who shall decide          what truth and love are?                                A cry of despair            The last supreme moment of mockery, desertion, tor-  50:6    ture, added to an overwhelming sense of the magnitude          of his work, wrung from Jesus' lips the awful          cry, \"My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  50:9    This despairing appeal, if made to a human parent, would          impugn the justice and love of a father who could with-          hold a clear token of his presence to sustain and bless so  50:12   faithful a son. The appeal of Jesus was made both to          his divine Principle, the God who is Love, and to himself,          Love's pure idea. Had Life, Truth, and Love forsaken  50:15   him in his highest demonstration? This was a startling          question. No! They must abide in him and he in them,          or that hour would be shorn of its mighty blessing for the  50:18   human race.                          Divine Science misunderstood            If his full recognition of eternal Life had for a mo-          ment given way "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34585"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 2 (of 6) (#11)"],[1,"and Sebastian del  Piombo, combining in himself a fertile invention, ideal beauty founded  on a correct imitation of the Greek style, grace, ease, amenity, and an  universality of genius in every department of the art. The noble  determination of triumphing in such a powerful contest animated him  night and day, and did not allow him any respite. It also excited him to  surpass both his rivals and himself in every new work which he produced.  The subjects, too, chosen for these chambers, aided him, as they were in  a great measure new, or required to be treated in a novel manner. They  did not profess to represent bacchanalian or vulgar scenes, but the  exalted symbols of science; the sacred functions of religion; military  actions, which contributed to establish the peace of the world;  important events of former days, under which were typified the reigns of  the Pontiffs Julius and Leo X.: the latter the most powerful protector,  and one of the most accomplished judges of art. More favourable  circumstances could not have conspired to stimulate a noble mind. The  eulogizing of Augustus was a theme for the poets of his age, which  produced the richest fruits of genius. Propertius, accustomed to sing  only of the charms or the disdain of his Cinthia, felt himself another  poet when called on to celebrate the triumphs of Augustus; and with  newborn fervour invoked Jove himself to suspend the functions of his  divinity whilst he sang the praises of the emperor.[38] It is certain  that such elevated subjects, in minds richly stored, must excite  corresponding ideas, and thus both in poets and painters, give birth to  the sublime.    Raffaello, on his arrival in Rome, says Vasari, was commissioned to  paint a chamber, which was at that time called La Segnatura, and which,  from the subject of the pictures, was also called the chamber of the  Sciences. On the ceiling are represented Theology, Philosophy, Poetry,  and Jurisprudence. Each of them has on the neighbouring facade a grand  historical piece illustrative of the subject. On the basement are also  historical pieces which belong to the same sciences; and these smaller  performances, and the caryatides and telamoni distributed around, are  monocromati or chiaroscuri, an idea entirely of Raffaello, and  afterwards, it is said, continued by Polidoro da Caravaggio. Raffaello  commenced with Theology, and imitated Petrarch, who in one of his  visions has assembled together men of the same condition, though living  in different ages. He there placed the evangelists, whose volumes are  the foundation of theology; the sacred writers, who have preserved its  traditions; the theologists, S. Thomas, S. Bonaventura, Scotus, and the  rest who have illustrated it by their arguments; above all, the Trinity  in the midst of the beatified, and beneath on an altar the eucharist, as  if to express the mystery of that doctrine. There are traces of the  ancient style in this piece. Gold is made use of in the glories of the  saints, and in other ornamental parts; the upper glory is formed on the  plan of that of S. Severo, which I have already noticed: the composition  is more symmetrical and less free than in other pieces; and the whole,  compared with the other compositions, seems too minute. Nevertheless,  whosoever regards each part in itself, will find it of such careful and  admirable execution, that he will be disposed to prefer it to all other  works. It has been observed, that Raffaello began this piece at the  right side, and that by the time he had arrived at the left side  portion, he had made rapid strides in the art. This work must have been  finished about the year 1508: and such was the surprise and admiration  of the Pope, that he ordered all the works of Bramantino, Pier della  Francesca, Signorelli, l'Abate di Arezzo, and Sodoma (though some of the  ornamental parts by this last are preserved) to be effaced, in order  that the whole chamber might be decorated by Raffaello.    In the subsequent works of Raffaello, and after the year 1509, we do not  find any traces of his first style. He had adopted a nobler manner, and  henceforth applied all his powers to the perfecting of it. He had now to  represent, on the opposite side, Philosophy. In this he designed a  gymnasium in the form of a temple, and placed the learned ancients, some  in the precincts of the building, some on the ascent of the steps, and  others in the plain below. In this, more than on any other occasion, he  was aided by his favourite Petrarch in the third capitolo of his Fame.  Plato, \"_che in quella schiera ando piu presso al segno_,\" is there  represented with Aristotle, \"_piu d'ingegno_,\" in the act of  disputation; and they possess also in the composition, the highest place  of honour; Socrates is represented instructing Alcibiades; Pythagoras is  seen, and before him a youth holds a tablet with the harmonious  concords; and Zoroaster, King of Bactriana, appears with an elementary  globe in his hand. Diogenes is stretched near on the ground, with his  wooden bowl in his hand, \"_assai piu che non vuol vergogna aperto_:\"  Archimedes is seen \"_star col capo basso_,\" and turning the compasses on  the table, instructs the youth in geometry; and others are represented  meditating, or in disputation, whose names and characters it would be  possible, with careful observation, to distinguish more truly than  Vasari has done. This picture is commonly called the School of Athens,  which in my judgment is just as appropriate, as the name of the  Sacrament bestowed on the first subject. The third picture, representing  Jurisprudence, is divided into two parts. On the left side of the window  stands Justinian, with the book of the Civil Law; Trebonian receives it  from his hand with an expression of submission and acquiescence, which  no other pencil can ever hope to equal. On the right side is seen  Gregory IX. who delivers the book of the Decretals to an advocate of the  Consistory, and bears the features of Julius II., who is thus honoured  in the character of his predecessor. In the concluding picture, which is  a personification of Poetry, is seen Mount Parnassus, where, in company  of Apollo and the muses, the Greek, Roman, and Tuscan poets are  represented in their own portraitures, as far as records will allow.  Homer, seated between Virgil and Dante, is, perhaps, the most striking  figure; he is evidently gifted with a divine spirit, and unites in his  person the characters of the prophet and the poet. The historical pieces  in chiaroscuro contribute, by their ornaments, to charm the sight, and  preserve the unity of design. Beneath the Theology, for instance, is  represented S. Augustine on the borders of the sea, instructed by the  angels not to explore the mystery of the Trinity, incomprehensible to  the human mind. Under the Philosophy, Archimedes is seen surprised and  slain by a soldier, whilst immersed in his studies. This first chamber  was finished in 1511, as that year appears inscribed near the Parnassus.    Vasari, until the finishing of the first chamber, does not speak of the  improvement of his manner; on the contrary, in his life of Raffaello, he  says, \"although he had seen so many monuments of antiquity in that city,  and studied so unremittingly, still his figures, up to this period, did  not possess that breadth and majesty which they afterwards exhibited.  For it happened, that the breach between Michelangiolo and the Pope,  which we have before mentioned in his life, occurred about this time,  and compelled Bonarruoti to flee to Florence; from which circumstance,  Bramante obtaining possession of the keys of the chapel, exhibited it to  his friend Raffaello, in order that he might make himself acquainted  with the style of Michelangiolo;\" and he then proceeds to mention the  Isaiah of S. Agostino, and the Sibyls della Pace, painted after this  period, and the Heliodorus. In the life of Michelangiolo, he again  informs us of the quarrel which obliged him to depart from Rome, and  proceeds to say, that when, on his return, he had finished one half of  the work, the Pope suddenly commanded it to be exposed; \"whereupon  Raffaello d'Urbino, who possessed great facility of imitation,  immediately changed his style, and at one effort designed the Prophets  and Sibyls della Pace.\" This brings us to a dispute prosecuted with the  greatest warmth both in Italy and other countries. Bellori attacked  Vasari in a violent manner, in a work entitled: \"_Se Raffaello ingrandi  e miglioro la maniera per aver vedute le opere di Michelangiolo_,\"  (Whether Raffaello enlarged and improved his style on seeing the works  of Michelangiolo). Crespi replied to him in three letters, inserted in  the Lettere Pittoriche,[39] and many other disputants have arisen and  stated fresh arguments.    It is not, however, our province to engage the reader in these  disputations. It was greatly to the advantage of Michelangiolo's fame to  have had two scholars, who, while he was yet living, and after the death  of Raffaello, employed themselves in writing his life; and a great  misfortune to Raffaello not to have been commemorated in the same  manner. If he had survived to the time when Vasari and Condivi wrote, he  would not have passed over their charges in silence. Raffaello would  then have easily proved, that when Bonarruoti fled to Florence, in 1506,  he himself was not in Rome, nor was called thither until two years  afterwards; and that he could not, therefore, have obtained a furtive  glance of the Sistine chapel. It would have been proved too, that from  the year 1508, when Michelangiolo had, perhaps, not commenced his work,  until 1511, in which year he exhibited the first half of it,[40]  Raffaello had been endeavouring to enlarge his style; and as  Michelangiolo had before studied the Torso of the Belvidere, so  Raffaello also formed himself on this and other marbles,[41] a  circumstance easily"]]]
