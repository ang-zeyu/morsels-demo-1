But in the eleventh year of my age I was given up by my own father for  the love of God, and destined to enter the service of the eternal King.\"  --_Orderic_, vol. ii. p. 301, ed. Prevost.    From Adam de Marisco's Letters, 53, we find that Henry and Almeric, the  eldest and youngest sons of the Earl of Montfort, were put under  Grosseteste for tuition, he being then a Bishop. At Paris, John of  Salisbury (who died in 1180) gained a living by teaching the sons of  noblemen,--(_instruendos susceperam_, ? took them in to board).  --_Metalogicus_, lib. 11, c. 10.    Henry of Huntingdon says, \"Richard, the king's (Henry I.'s) bastard son,  was honourably brought up (_festive nutritus_) by our Bishop Robert  (Blote of Lincoln), and duly reverenced by me and others in the same  household I lived in.\" --_Anglia Sacra_, vol. ii. p. 696. Giraldus  Cambrensis speaks of beating his _coætanei et conscolares terræ suæ_, of  being reproved for idleness by his uncle, the Bishop of St David's, and  of being constantly chaffed by two of his uncle's chaplains, who used to  decline _durus_ and _stultus_ to him. Also he alludes to the rod.  Probably there was some sort of school at either Pembroke or St  David's[[24a]].--_De Rebus a se Gestis_, lib. 1, c. 2.[25]    The Statutes of a Gild of young Scholars formed to burn lights in honour  of some saint or other, and to help one another in sickness, old age,  and to burial, will be printed for us by Mr Toulmin Smith in the Early  English Text Society's books this year.    Under this head of Private Tuition we may class the houses of Abbots,  where boys of good birth were educated. In his History of English  Poetry, section 36, vol. iii. p. 9, ed. 1840, Warton says:      \"It appears to have been customary for the governors of the most    considerable convents, especially those that were honoured with    the mitre, to receive into their own private lodgings the sons of    the principal families of the neighbourhood for education. About    the year 1450, Thomas Bromele, abbot of the mitred monastery of    Hyde near Winchester, entertained in his own abbatial house within    that monastery eight young gentlemen, or _gentiles pueri_, who    were placed there for the purpose of literary instruction, and    constantly dined at the abbot's table. I will not scruple to give    the original words, which are more particular and expressive, of    the obscure record which preserves this curious anecdote of    monastic life. '_Pro octo gentilibus pueris apud dominum abbatem    studii causa perhendinantibus, et ad mensam domini victitantibus,    cum garcionibus suis ipsos comitantibus, hoc anno_, xvii_l._ ixs.    _Capiendo pro_[26]...'\" This, by the way, was more extraordinary,    as William of Wykeham's celebrated seminary was so near. And this    seems to have been an established practice of the abbot of    Glastonbury, \"whose apartment in the abbey was a kind of    well-disciplined court, where the sons of noblemen and young    gentlemen were wont to be sent for virtuous education, who    returned thence home excellently accomplished.[27]\" Richard    Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury, who was cruelly executed    by the king, during the course of his government educated near    three hundred ingenuous youths, who constituted a part of his    family; beside many others whom he liberally supported at the    universities.[28] Whitgift, the most excellent and learned    archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was    educated under Robert Whitgift his uncle, abbot of the Augustine    monastery of black canons at Wellhow in Lincolnshire, \"who,\" says    Strype, \"had several other young gentlemen under his care for    education.\" (Strype's Whitgift, v. i. ch. i. p. 3.)    Of Lydgate--about 1420-30 A.D. I suppose--Prof. Morley says in his  _English Writers_, vol. ii. Pt. I. p. 423:      \"After studying at Oxford, Paris, and Padua, and after mastering    with special delight the writings of such poets as Dante,    Boccaccio, and Alain Chartier, Lydgate opened at his monastery of    Bury St Edmund's a school of rhetoric in which he taught young    nobles literature and the art of versifying!\"    Richard Pace says in his _De Fructu_, 1517:      \"Now the learning of music too demands its place, especially from    me whom it distinguished when a boy amongst boys. For Thomas    Langton, bishop of Winchester (the predecessor of him who is now    living), whose secretary I was, when he had marked that I was    making a proficiency in music far beyond my age (as    himself--perchance from his too great affection for me--would    point out and repeatedly say), 'The talent of this lad,' he said,    'is born for greater things,' and a few days afterwards he sent    me, to pursue the study of literature, into Italy, to the school    at Padua, which then was at its greatest prime, and benevolently    supplied the annual expenses, as he showed wonderful favour to all    men of letters, and in his day played the part of a second    Mecænas, well remembering (as he ofttimes said) that he had been    advanced to the episcopal dignity on account of his learning. For    he had gained, with the highest commendation, the distinctions of    each law[29] (as they say now-a-days). Also he so highly prized    the study of Humanity[30] that he had boys and youths instructed    in it at a school in his house; And he was vastly delighted to    hear the scholars repeat to him at night the lessons given them by    the teacher during the day. In this competition he who had borne    himself notably went away with a present of something suitable to    his character, and with commendation expressed in the most refined    language; for that excellent governor had ever in his mouth the    maxim that merit grows with praise.\"[31]      [Headnote: EDUCATION AT HOME AND AT TUTORS'.]    Palsgrave in 1530 speaks of \"maister Petrus Vallensys, scole maister  to his [Charles, Duke of Suffolk's] excellent yong sonne the Erle of  Lyncolne.\"    Roger Ascham, author of the _Scholemaster_, &c., born in 1515,      \"was received at a very youthful age into the family of Sir Antony    Wingfield, who furnished money for his education, and placed    Roger, together with his own sons, under a tutor whose name was    Bond. The boy had by nature a taste for books, and showed his good    taste by reading English in preference to Latin, with wonderful    eagerness. This was the more remarkable from the fact that Latin    was still the language of literature, and it is not likely that    the few English books written at that time were at all largely    spread abroad in places far away from the Universities and    Cathedral towns. In or about the year 1530, Mr Bond the domestic    tutor resigned the charge of young Roger, who was now about    fifteen years old, and by the advice and pecuniary aid of his kind    patron Sir Antony, he was enabled to enter St John's College,    Cambridge, at that time the most famous seminary of learning in    all England ... he took his bachelor's degree in 1531, Feb. 18, in    the 18th year of his age [\"being a boy, new bachelor of art,\" he    says himself,] a time of life at which it is now more common to    enter the University than to take a degree, but which, according    to the modes of education then in use, was not thought premature.    On the 23rd of March following, he was elected fellow of the    College.\" Giles's Life of Ascham, Works, vol. i. p. xi-xiv.    Dr Clement and his wife were brought up in Sir T. More's house. Clement  was taken from St Paul's school, London, appointed tutor to More's  children, and afterwards to his daughter Margaret, p. 402, col. 1.    What a young nobleman learnt in Henry the Eighth's time may be gathered  from the following extracts (partly given by Mr Froude, Hist., v. i. p.  39-40) from the letters of young Gregory Cromwell's tutor, to his  father, the Earl of Essex, the King's Chief Secretary.      \"The order of his studie, as the houres lymyted for the Frenche    tongue, writinge, plaienge att weapons, castinge of accomptes,    pastimes of instruments, and suche others, hath bene devised and    directed by the prudent wisdome of Mr Southwell; who with a    ffatherly zeale and amitie muche desiringe to have hime a sonne    worthy suche parents, ceasseth not aswell concerninge all other    things for hime mete and necessary, as also in lerninge,    t'expresse his tendre love and affection towardes hime, serchinge    by all meanes possible howe he may moste proffitte, dailie heringe    hime to rede sumwhatt in thenglishe tongue, and advertisenge hime    of the naturell and true kynde of pronuntiacõn therof, expoundinge    also and declaringe the etimologie and native signification of    suche wordes as we have borowed of the Latines or Frenche menue,    not evyn so comonly used in our quotidiene speche.

I cannot give you that.  But you shall have my spears and my drinking-horn,\" said Ingolf. \"For  surely Odin has chosen you for Valhalla, even though you did not  sacrifice. You are too good a man to go to Niflheim. You would make  times merry in Valhalla.\"    So Ingolf put his spears and his drinking-horn by Leif. Then the men  raised a great mound over all the dead. After that they went aboard  their boat and sailed for the islands that Ingolf had seen. It was  evening when they reached them.    \"I see smoke rising from that one,\" Ingolf said, pointing.    He steered for it. It was a steep rock like that one in the Faroes, but  they found a harbor and landed and climbed the steep hill and came out  on top. They saw the ten thralls sitting about a bonfire eating. Helga  and the other women from Leif's house sat near, huddled together, white  and frightened. One of the thralls gave a great laugh and shouted:    \"This is better than pulling Leif's plow. To-morrow we will sail for  Ireland with all his wealth.\"    \"To-morrow you will be freezing in Niflheim,\" cried Ingolf, and he  leaped among them swinging his sword, and all his men followed him, and  they killed those thralls.    Then Ingolf turned to Helga. She threw herself into his arms and wept.  But after a while she told him this story:    \"When springtime came, Leif thought that he would sow wheat. He had but  one ox. The others had died during the winter. So he set the thralls to  help pull the plow. I saw their sour looks and was afraid, but Leif only  laughed:    \"'What else can thralls expect?' he said. 'Never fear them, good wife.'    \"Now one day soon after that the thralls came running to the house  calling out:    \"'The ox is dead! The ox is dead!'    \"Leif asked them about it. They said that a bear had come out of the  woods and killed it, and that they had scared the beast away. They  pointed out where it had gone. Then Leif called his men and said:    \"'A hunt! I had not hoped for such great sport here. Ah, we will have a  feast off that bear!'    \"So they took their spears and went out into the woods. As soon as they  were gone, the thralls came running into the house and took down all the  swords and shields from the wall and ran out. In some way they met my  lord and his men in the woods and killed them. Then they came back and  took everything in the house and dragged us to the boat and sailed  here.\"    \"O my brother!\" said Ingolf, \"where is that song about 'those two  foster-brothers, Ingolf and Leif, who made a new country in a wonderful  land, and whose sons and grandsons are mighty men in Iceland'? But come  home with me, Helga.\"    So they took the women and Leif's things and Leif's boat and sailed  home. The next day after they came to Ingolf's house, Helga said:    \"We have made your family larger, brother Ingolf. Will you not take  Leif's two houses and live in them? He does not need them now. He would  like you to have them.\"    \"It would be pleasant to live there,\" Ingolf said. \"I thank you.\"    So the next day they loaded everything aboard the two ships and sailed  for Leif's house. There they stayed for a year. Ingolf still sent his  thralls out to look for the pillars. He was careful always to have hay,  so his cattle prospered. That spring he planted wheat, but it did not  grow well.    \"This is sickly stuff,\" Ingolf said. \"It takes too much time and work.  It is better to save the land for hay. Perhaps we can sometime go back  to Norway for flour.\"    At last one day the thralls came home and said:    \"We have found the pillars.\"    Ingolf jumped to his feet. He cried out:    \"You have kept me waiting three years, Thor. But as soon as my house and  temple are built, I will sacrifice to you three horses as a  thank-offering.\"    \"It is a long way off, master,\" the thralls said, \"and we have found  much better places in our walks about the island.\"    \"Thor knows best,\" Ingolf answered. \"I will settle where he leads me.\"    So that summer they loaded everything into the ships again and sailed  west along the coast until they came to the place where the pillars  were. The land there was low and green. On both sides were low hills. A  little lake glistened back from shore. In the valley were hot springs,  with steam rising from them.    \"It looks like smoke,\" the men said. \"It is very strange to see hot  water and smoke come out of the ground.\"    In front of this green land was a good harbor with islands in it. Far  over the sea toward the north shone a great ice-mountain.    \"I like the place,\" Ingolf said. \"I will make this land mine.\"    So he built fires at the mouth of the river near there, and stood by  them and called out loudly:    \"I have put my fire at the mouth of these rivers. All the land that they  drain is mine, and no man shall claim it but me. I will call this place  Reykjavik.\"[13]    Then Ingolf built his feast hall. He himself carved the beams and the  door-posts. Gaily painted dragons leaned out from the doors and stood up  from the gables. Men and animals fought on the door-posts. For the doors  he made at the forge great iron hinges. Their ends curved and spread all  over the door. Near his feast hall he built a storehouse and a kitchen  and a smithy and a stable and a bower for the women.    \"We do not need a sleeping-house for guests,\" he said. \"Who would be our  guests?\"    He roofed all his buildings with turf. It made them look like green  mounds with gay carved and painted walls under them. He built also a  temple, and on that was beautiful carving. In this he set up those  statues that had been in his old temple. He put up, too, those pillars  of his high seat that had been drifting about so long. Under them he  laid the soil of Norway that he had brought in the little bronze chest.    \"I have kept my vow, O Thor!\" he cried.    Then he sacrificed three horses that he had promised to Thor. After that  was over, he said:    \"Here is a good field for sport. Let us have some of the old games that  we used to play at home. Who will wrestle with me?\"    So they wrestled there and ran races and swam in the water. The women  sat and looked on.    \"Oh, this is good to see!\" Helga cried. \"We are as gay as we used to be  in old Norway.\"    But it was not many weeks before Ingolf said:    \"I wish that I might sometime see sails in that harbor. I wish that I  might think, 'Around this point of land is another farm, and across the  bay is another. I can go there when I am very lonely.' I wish that I  might sometime be invited to a feast. I wish that I might sometimes hear  the good, clanging music of weapons at play. It is a good land, but we  have lived alone for four years. I am hungry for new faces and for  tidings of Norway.\"    One night as he and his men sat about the long fire in the feast hall, a  servant threw a great piece of wood upon the fire. It was streaked with  faded paint and it showed bits of carving.    \"See,\" said Ingolf, pointing to it, \"see what is left of a good ship's  prow! What lands have you seen, O dragon's head? What battles have you  fought? What was your master's name? Where did the storm meet you?  Perhaps he was coming to Iceland, comrades. Would it not have been  pleasant to see his sail and to shake his hand and to welcome him to  Iceland? But instead he is in Ran's caves, and only his broken prow has  drifted here.\"    Now it was not many months after that when one of the men came running  into the feast hall, shouting:    \"A sail! a sail in the harbor!\"    All those men gave a shout with no word in it, as though their hearts  had leaped into their throats. They jumped up and ran to the shore and  stood there with hungry eyes. When the men landed, those Icelanders  clapped them on the shoulders, and tears ran down their faces. For a  long time they could say nothing but \"Welcome! Welcome!\"    [Illustration: \"_Those Icelanders clapped them on the shoulders_\"]    But after a while Ingolf led them to the feast hall and had a feast  spread at once. While the thralls were at work, the men stood together  and talked. Such a noise had never been in that hall before.    \"We have already built our fires and claimed our land up the shore a  way,\" the leader said. \"Men in Norway talk much of Ingolf and Leif, and  wonder what has happened to them.\"    Then Ingolf told them of all that had come to pass in Iceland; and then  he asked of Norway.    \"Ah! things are going from bad to worse,\" the newcomers said. \"Harald  grows mightier every day. A man dare not swing a sword now except for  the king. We came here to get away from him. Many men are talking of  Iceland. Soon the sea-road between here and Norway will be swarming with  dragons.\"    And so it was. Ships also came from Ireland and from the Shetlands and  the Orkneys.    \"Harald has come west-over-seas,\" the men of these ships said, \"and has  laid his heavy hand upon the islands and put his earls over them. They  are no place now for free men.\"    So by the time Ingolf was an old man, Iceland was no longer an empty  land. Every valley was spotted with bright feast halls and temples.  Horses and cattle pastured on the hillsides. Smoke curled up from  kitchens and smithies. Gay ships sailed the waters, taking Iceland cloth  and wool and Iceland fish and oil and the soft feathers of Iceland birds  to Norway to sell, and bringing back wood and flour and grain.    When Ingolf died, his men drew up on the shore the boat in which he had  come to Iceland. They painted it freshly and put new gold on it, so that  it stood there a glittering dragon with head raised high, looking over  the water. Old Sighvat lifted a huge stone and carried it to the ship's  side. With all his strength he threw it into the bottom. The timbers"]]]
