Beside them in  literature and general renown all other beings sink into insignificance.  A belief in them formerly dominated the whole of Irish life. The _Sidhe_  or Tuatha De Danann were a people like ourselves who inhabited the  hills--not as a rule the highest and most salient eminences, but I think  more usually the pleasant undulating slopes or gentle hill-sides--and  who lived there a life of their own, marrying or giving in marriage,  banqueting or making war, and leading there just as real a life as is  our own. All Irish literature, particularly perhaps the 'Colloquy of  the Ancients' (_Agallamh na Senorach_) abounds with reference to them.  To inquire how the Irish originally came by their belief in these  beings, the _Sidhe_ or Tuatha De Danann, is to raise a question which  cannot be answered, any more than one can answer the question, Where did  the Romans obtain their belief in Bacchus and the fauns, or the Greeks  their own belief in the beings of Olympus?    But granting such belief to have been indigenous to the Irish, as it  certainly seems to have been, then the tall, handsome fairies of Ben  Bulbin and the Sligo district, about whom Mr. Wentz tells us so much  interesting matter, might be accounted for as being a continuation of  the tradition of the ancient Gaels, or _a piece of heredity inherent in  the folk-imagination_. I mean, in other words, that the tradition about  these handsome dwellers within the hill-sides having been handed down  for ages, and having been perhaps exceptionally well preserved in those  districts, people saw just what they had always been told existed, or,  if I may so put it, they saw what they expected to see.    Fin Bheara, the King of the Connacht Fairies in Cnoc Meadha (or  Castlehacket) in the County Galway, his Queen Nuala, and all the  beautiful forms seen by Mr. Wentz's seer-witness (pp. 60 ff.), all the  banshees and all the human figures, white women, and so forth, who are  seen in raths and moats and on hill-sides, are the direct descendants,  so to speak, of the Tuatha De Danann or the _Sidhe_. Of this, I think,  there can be no doubt whatever.    But then how are we to account for the little red-dressed men and women  and the leprechauns? Yet, are they any more wonderful than the pygmies  of classic tradition? Is not the Mermaid to be found in Greece, and is  not the Lorelei as Germanic as the Kelpy is Caledonian. If we grant that  all these are creatures of primitive folk-belief, then how they come to  be so ceases to be a Celtic problem, it becomes a world problem. But  granted, as I say, that they were all creatures of primitive  folk-belief, then their occasional appearances, or the belief in such,  may be accounted for in exactly the same way as I have suggested to be  possible in the case of the Ben Bulbin fairies.    As for the belief in ghosts or _revenants_ (in Irish _tais_ or  _taidhbhse_), it seems to me that this may possibly rest to some extent  upon a different footing altogether. Here we are not confronted by a  different order of beings of different shapes and attributes from our  own, but only with the appearances, amongst the living, of men who were  believed or known to be dead or far away from the scene of their  appearances. Even those who may be most sceptical about the _Sidhe_-folk  and the leprechauns are likely to be convinced (on the mere evidence)  that the existence of 'astral bodies' or 'doubles', or whatever we may  call them, and the appearances of people, especially in the hour of  their death, to other people who were perhaps hundreds of miles away at  the time, is amply proven. Yet whatever may have been the case  originally when man was young, I do not think that this had in later  times any more direct bearing upon the belief in the _Sidhe_, the  leprechauns, the mermaid, and similar beings than upon the belief in the  Greek Pantheon, the naiads, the dryads, or the fauns; all of which  beliefs, probably arising originally from an animistic source, must have  differentiated themselves at a very early period. Of course every real  apparition, every 'ghost' apparition, tends now, and must have tended at  all times, to strengthen every spirit belief. For do not ghost  apparitions belong, in a way, to the same realm as all the others we  have spoken of, that is, to a realm equally outside our normal  experience?    Another very interesting point, and one hitherto generally overlooked,  is this, that different parts of the Irish soil cherish different bodies  of supernatural beings. The North of Ireland believes in beings unknown  in the South, and North-East Leinster has spirits unknown to the West.  Some places seem to be almost given up to special beliefs. Any outsider,  for instance, who may have read that powerful and grisly book, _La  Legende de la Mort_, by M. Anatole Le Braz, in two large volumes, all  about the awful appearances of _Ankou_ (Death), who simply dominates the  folk-lore of Brittany, will probably be very much astonished to know  that, though I have been collecting Irish folk-lore all my life, I have  never met Death figuring as a personality in more than two or three  tales, and these mostly of a trivial or humorous description, though the  Deaf Coach (_Coiste Bodhar_), the belief in which is pretty general,  does seem a kind of parallel to the creaking cart in which _Ankou_  rides.    I would suggest, then, that the restriction of certain forms of spirits,  if I may so call them, to certain localities, may be due to race  intermixture. I would imagine that where the people of a primitive tribe  settled down most strongly, they also most strongly preserved the memory  of those supernatural beings who were peculiarly their own. The  _Sidhe_-folk appear to be pre-eminently and distinctively Milesian, but  the _geancanach_ (name of some little spirit in Meath and portion of  Ulster) may have been believed in by a race entirely different from that  which believed in the _cluracaun_ (a Munster sprite). Some of these  beliefs may be Aryan, but many are probably pre-Celtic.    Is it not strange that while the names and exploits of the great  semi-mythological heroes of the various Saga cycles of Ireland,  Cuchulainn, Conor mac Nessa, Finn, Osgar, Oisin, and the rest, are at  present the inheritance of all Ireland, and are known in every part of  it, there should still be, as I have said, supernatural beings believed  in which are unknown outside of their own districts, and of which the  rest of Ireland has never heard? If the inhabitants of the limited  districts in which these are seen still think they see them, my  suggestion is that the earlier race handed down an account of the  primitive beings believed in by their own tribe, and later generations,  if they saw anything, saw just what they were told existed.    Whilst far from questioning the actual existence of certain spiritual  forms and apparitions, I venture to throw out these considerations for  what they may be worth, and I desire again to thank Mr. Wentz for all  the valuable data he has collected for throwing light upon so  interesting a question.      RATRA, FRENCHPARK,      COUNTY ROSCOMMON, IRELAND,        _September_ 1910.      THE FAIRY FOLK OF TARA    On the ancient Hill of Tara, from whose heights the High Kings once  ruled all Ireland, from where the sacred fires in pagan days announced  the annual resurrection of the sun, the Easter Tide, where the magic of  Patrick prevailed over the magic of the Druids, and where the hosts of  the Tuatha De Danann were wont to appear at the great Feast of _Samain_,  to-day the fairy-folk of modern times hold undisputed sovereignty. And  from no point better than Tara, which thus was once the magical and  political centre of the Sacred Island, could we begin our study of the  Irish Fairy-Faith. Though the Hill has lain unploughed and deserted  since the curses of Christian priests fell upon it, on the calm air of  summer evenings, at the twilight hour, wondrous music still sounds over  its slopes, and at night long, weird processions of silent spirits march  round its grass-grown _raths_ and _forts_.[11] It is only men who fear  the curse of the Christians; the fairy-folk regard it not.    The Rev. Father Peter Kenney, of Kilmessan, had directed me to John  Graham, an old man over seventy years of age, who has lived near Tara  most of his life; and after I had found John, and he had led me from  _rath_ to _rath_ and then right through the length of the site where  once stood the banquet hall of kings and heroes and Druids, as he  earnestly described the past glories of Tara to which these ancient  monuments bear silent testimony, we sat down in the thick sweet grass on  the Sacred Hill and began talking of the olden times in Ireland, and  then of the 'good people':--    _The 'Good People's' Music._--'As sure as you are sitting down I heard  the pipes there in that wood (pointing to a wood on the north-west  slope of the Hill, and west of the banquet hall). I heard the music  another time on a hot summer evening at the Rath of Ringlestown, in a  field where all the grass had been burned off; and I often heard it in  the wood of Tara. Whenever the _good people_ play, you hear their music  all through the field as plain as can be; and it is the grandest kind of  music. It may last half the night, but once day comes, it ends.'    _Who the 'Good People' are._--I now asked John what sort of a race the  'good people' are, and where they came from, and this is his  reply:--'People killed and murdered in war stay on earth till their time  is up, and they are among the _good people_. The souls on this earth are  as thick as the grass (running his walking-stick through a thick clump),  and you can't see them; and evil spirits are just as thick, too, and  people don't know it. Because there are so many spirits knocking (going)  about they must appear to some people. The old folk saw"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#11)"],[1,"of education ought to be given  up. On the contrary, we knew that education must go on, and in much more  vigorous fashion than ever before. The first thing we did was to enter  upon a sensational campaign to arouse the public to the importance of  woman suffrage, and to interest it in our plans for forcing the  Government's hands. I think we can claim that our success in this regard  was instant, and that it has proved permanent. From the very first, in  those early London days, when we were few in numbers and very poor in  purse, we made the public aware of the woman suffrage movement as it had  never been before. We adopted Salvation Army methods and went out into  the highways and the byways after converts. We threw away all our  conventional notions of what was \"ladylike\" and \"good form,\" and we  applied to our methods the one test question, Will it help? Just as the  Booths and their followers took religion to the street crowds in such  fashion that the church people were horrified, so we took suffrage to  the general public in a manner that amazed and scandalised the other  suffragists.    We had a lot of suffrage literature printed, and day by day our members  went forth and held street meetings. Selecting a favourable spot, with a  chair for a rostrum, one of us would ring a bell until people began to  stop to see what was going to happen. What happened, of course, was a  lively suffrage speech, and the distribution of literature. Soon after  our campaign had started, the sound of the bell was a signal for a crowd  to spring up as if by magic. All over the neighbourhood you heard the  cry: \"Here are the Suffragettes! Come on!\" We covered London in this  way; we never lacked an audience, and best of all, an audience to which  the woman-suffrage doctrine was new. We were increasing our favourable  public as well as waking it up. Besides these street meetings, we held  many hall and drawing-room meetings, and we got a great deal of press  publicity, which was something never accorded the older suffrage  methods.    Our plans included the introduction of a Government suffrage bill at  the earliest possible moment, and in the spring of 1906 we sent a  deputation of about thirty of our members to interview the Prime  Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The Prime Minister, it was  stated, was not at home; so in a few days we sent another deputation.  This time the servant agreed to carry our request to the Prime Minister.  The women waited patiently on the doorstep of the official residence,  No. 10 Downing Street, for nearly an hour. Then the door opened and two  men appeared. One of the men addressed the leader of the deputation,  roughly ordering her and the others to leave. \"We have sent a message to  the Prime Minister,\" she replied, \"and we are waiting for the answer.\"  \"There will be no answer,\" was the stern rejoinder, and the door closed.    \"Yes, there will be an answer,\" exclaimed the leader, and she seized the  door-knocker and banged it sharply. Instantly the men reappeared, and  one of them called to a policeman standing near, \"Take this woman in  charge.\" The order was obeyed, and the peaceful deputation saw its  leader taken off to Canon Row Station.    Instantly the women protested vigorously. Annie Kenney began to address  the crowd that had gathered, and Mrs. Drummond actually forced her way  past the doorkeeper into the sacred residence of the Prime Minister of  the British Empire! Her arrest and Annie's followed. The three women  were detained at the police station for about an hour, long enough, the  Prime Minister probably thought, to frighten them thoroughly and teach  them not to do such dreadful things again. Then he sent them word that  he had decided not to prosecute them, but would, on the contrary,  receive a deputation from the W. S. P. U., and, if they cared to attend,  from other suffrage societies as well.    All the suffrage organisations at once began making preparations for the  great event. At the same time two hundred members of Parliament sent a  petition to the Prime Minister, asking him to receive their committee  that they might urge upon him the necessity of a Government measure for  woman suffrage. Sir Henry fixed May 19th as the day on which he would  receive a joint deputation from Parliament and from the women's suffrage  organisations.    The W. S. P. U. determined to make the occasion as public as possible,  and began preparations for a procession and a demonstration. When the  day came we assembled at the foot of the beautiful monument to the  warrior-queen, Boadicea, that guards the entrance to Westminster Bridge,  and from there we marched to the Foreign Office. At the meeting eight  women spoke in behalf of an immediate suffrage measure, and Mr. Keir  Hardie presented the argument for the suffrage members of Parliament. I  spoke for the W. S. P. U., and I tried to make the Prime Minister see  that no business could be more pressing than ours. I told him that the  group of women organised in our Union felt so strongly the necessity for  women enfranchisement that they were prepared to sacrifice for it  everything they possessed, their means of livelihood, their very lives,  if necessary. I begged him to make such a sacrifice needless by doing us  justice now.    What answer do you think Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman made us? He  assured us of his sympathy with our cause, his belief in its justice,  and his confidence in our fitness to vote. And then he told us to have  patience and wait; he could do nothing for us because some of his  Cabinet were opposed to us. After a few more words the usual vote of  thanks was moved, and the deputation was dismissed. I had not expected  anything better, but it wrung my heart to see the bitter disappointment  of the W. S. P. U. women who had waited in the street to hear from the  leaders the result of the deputation. We held a great meeting of protest  that afternoon, and determined to carry on our agitation with increased  vigor.    Now that it had been made plain that the Government were resolved not to  bring in a suffrage bill, there was nothing to do but to continue our  policy of waking up the country, not only by public speeches and  demonstrations, but by a constant heckling of Cabinet Ministers. Since  the memorable occasion when Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney were  thrown out of Sir Edward Grey's meeting in Manchester, and afterward  imprisoned for the crime of asking a courteous question, we had not lost  an opportunity of addressing the same question to every Cabinet Minister  we could manage to encounter. For this we have been unmercifully  criticised, and in a large number of cases most brutally handled.    In almost every one of my American meetings I was asked the question,  \"What good do you expect to accomplish by interrupting meetings?\" Is it  possible that the time-honoured, almost sacred English privilege of  interrupting is unknown in America? I cannot imagine a political meeting  from which \"the Voice\" was entirely absent. In England it is invariably  present. It is considered the inalienable right of the opposition to  heckle the speaker and to hurl questions at him which are calculated to  spoil his arguments. For instance, when Liberals attend a Conservative  gathering they go prepared to shatter by witticisms and pointed  questions all the best effects of the Conservative orators. The next day  you will read in Liberal newspapers headlines like these: \"The Voice in  Fine Form,\" \"Short Shrift for Tory Twaddle,\" \"Awkward Answers from the  Enemy's Platform.\" In the body of the article you will learn that \"Lord  X found that the Liberals at his meeting were more than a match for  him,\" that \"there was continued interruption during Sir So-and-so's  speech,\" that \"Lord M fared badly last night in his encounter with the  Voice,\" or that \"Captain Z had the greatest difficulty in making himself  heard.\"    In accordance with this custom we heckle Cabinet Ministers. Mr. Winston  Churchill, for example, is speaking. \"One great question,\" he exclaims,  \"remains to be settled.\"    \"And that is woman suffrage,\" shouts a voice from the gallery.    Mr. Churchill struggles on with his speech: \"The men have been  complaining of me----\"    \"The women have been complaining of you, too, Mr. Churchill,\" comes  back promptly from the back of the hall.    \"In the circumstances what can we do but----\"    \"Give votes to women.\"    Our object, of course, is to keep woman suffrage in the foreground of  interest and to insist on every possible occasion that no other reform  advocated is of such immediate importance.    From the first the women's interruptions have been resented with  unreasoning anger. I remember hearing Mr. Lloyd-George saying once of a  man who interrupted him:    \"Let him remain. I like interruptions. They show that people holding  different opinions to mine are present, giving me a chance to convert  them.\" But when suffragists interrupt Mr. Lloyd-George he says something  polite like this: \"Pay no attention to those cats mewing.\"    Some of the ministers are more well bred in their expressions, but all  are disdainful and resentful. All see with approval the brutal ejection  of the women by the Liberal stewards.    At one meeting where Mr. Lloyd-George was speaking, we interrupted with  a question, and he claimed the sympathy of the audience on the score  that he was a friend to woman suffrage. \"Then why don't you do something  to give votes to women?\" was the obvious retort. But Mr. Lloyd-George  evaded this by the counter query: \"Why don't they go for their enemies?  Why don't they go for their greatest enemy?\" Instantly, all over the  hall, voices shouted, \"Asquith! Asquith!\" For even at that early day it  was known that the then Chancellor of the Exchequer was a stern foe of  women's independence.    In the summer of 1906, together with other members of the W. S. P. U., I  went to"]]]
