Upon Bocchoris's  having received these oracles, he called for their priests, and the  attendants upon their altars, and ordered them to make a collection of  the impure people, and to deliver them to the soldiers, to carry them  away into the desert; but to take the leprous people, and wrap them in  sheets of lead, and let them down into the sea. Hereupon the scabby and  leprous people were drowned, and the rest were gotten together, and sent  into desert places, in order to be exposed to destruction. In this case  they assembled themselves together, and took counsel what they should  do, and determined that, as the night was coming on, they should kindle  fires and lamps, and keep watch; that they also should fast the next  night, and propitiate the gods, in order to obtain deliverance from  them. That on the next day there was one Moses, who advised them that  they should venture upon a journey, and go along one road till they  should come to places fit for habitation: that he charged them to have  no kind regards for any man, nor give good counsel to any, but always to  advise them for the worst; and to overturn all those temples and altars  of the gods they should meet with: that the rest commended what he  had said with one consent, and did what they had resolved on, and so  traveled over the desert. But that the difficulties of the journey being  over, they came to a country inhabited, and that there they abused the  men, and plundered and burnt their temples; and then came into that land  which is called Judea, and there they built a city, and dwelt therein,  and that their city was named Hierosyla, from this their robbing of the  temples; but that still, upon the success they had afterwards, they in  time changed its denomination, that it might not be a reproach to them,  and called the city Hierosolyma, and themselves Hierosolymites.\"    35. Now this man did not discover and mention the same king with the  others, but feigned a newer name, and passing by the dream and the  Egyptian prophet, he brings him to [Jupiter] Hammon, in order to gain  oracles about the scabby and leprous people; for he says that the  multitude of Jews were gathered together at the temples. Now it is  uncertain whether he ascribes this name to these lepers, or to those  that were subject to such diseases among the Jews only; for he describes  them as a people of the Jews. What people does he mean? foreigners, or  those of that country? Why then' dost thou call them Jews, if they were  Egyptians? But if they were foreigners, why dost thou not tell us whence  they came? And how could it be that, after the king had drowned many of  them in the sea, and ejected the rest into desert places, there should  be still so great a multitude remaining? Or after what manner did they  pass over the desert, and get the land which we now dwell in, and build  our city, and that temple which hath been so famous among all mankind?  And besides, he ought to have spoken more about our legislator than by  giving us his bare name; and to have informed us of what nation he was,  and what parents he was derived from; and to have assigned the reasons  why he undertook to make such laws concerning the gods, and concerning  matters of injustice with regard to men during that journey. For in case  the people were by birth Egyptians, they would not on the sudden have so  easily changed the customs of their country; and in case they had been  foreigners, they had for certain some laws or other which had been kept  by them from long custom. It is true, that with regard to those who had  ejected them, they might have sworn never to bear good-will to them,  and might have had a plausible reason for so doing. But if these men  resolved to wage an implacable war against all men, in case they had  acted as wickedly as he relates of them, and this while they wanted the  assistance of all men, this demonstrates a kind of mad conduct indeed;  but not of the men themselves, but very greatly so of him that tells  such lies about them. He hath also impudence enough to say that a name,  implying \"Robbers of the temples,\" [26] was given to their city, and  that this name was afterward changed. The reason of which is plain, that  the former name brought reproach and hatred upon them in the times of  their posterity, while, it seems, those that built the city thought they  did honor to the city by giving it such a name. So we see that this fine  fellow had such an unbounded inclination to reproach us, that he did not  understand that robbery of temples is not expressed By the same word and  name among the Jews as it is among the Greeks. But why should a man say  any more to a person who tells such impudent lies? However, since this  book is arisen to a competent length, I will make another beginning, and  endeavor to add what still remains to perfect my design in the following  book.          APION BOOK 1 FOOTNOTES    [1] This first book has a wrong title. It is not written against Apion,  as is the first part of the second book, but against those Greeks in  general who would not believe Josephus's former accounts of the very  ancient state of the Jewish nation, in his 20 books of Antiquities; and  particularly against Agatharelddes, Manetho, Cheremon, and Lysimachus.  it is one of the most learned, excellent, and useful books of all  antiquity; and upon Jerome's perusal of this and the following book,  he declares that it seems to him a miraculous thing \"how one that was  a Hebrew, who had been from his infancy instructed in sacred learning,  should be able to pronounce such a number of testimonies out of profane  authors, as if he had read over all the Grecian libraries,\" Epist. 8.  ad Magnum; and the learned Jew, Manasseh-Ben-Israel, esteemed these two  books so excellent, as to translate them into the Hebrew; this we learn  from his own catalogue of his works, which I have seen. As to the time  and place when and where these two books were written, the learned have  not hitherto been able to determine them any further than that they were  written some time after his Antiquities, or some time after A.D. 93;  which indeed is too obvious at their entrance to be overlooked by even a  careless peruser, they being directly intended against those that would  not believe what he had advanced in those books con-the great of the  Jewish nation As to the place, they all imagine that these two books  were written where the former were, I mean at Rome; and I confess that  I myself believed both those determinations, till I came to finish my  notes upon these books, when I met with plain indications that they were  written not at Rome, but in Judea, and this after the third of Trajan,  or A.D. 100.    [2] Take Dr. Hudson's note here, which as it justly contradicts the  common opinion that Josephus either died under Domitian, or at least  wrote nothing later than his days, so does it perfectly agree to my own  determination, from Justus of Tiberias, that he wrote or finished his  own Life after the third of Trajan, or A.D. 100. To which Noldius also  agrees, de Herod, No. 383 [Epaphroditus]. \"Since Florius Josephus,\"  says Dr. Hudson, \"wrote [or finished] his books of Antiquities on the  thirteenth of Domitian, [A.D. 93,] and after that wrote the Memoirs of  his own Life, as an appendix to the books of Antiquities, and at last  his two books against Apion, and yet dedicated all those writings  to Epaphroditus; he can hardly be that Epaphroditus who was formerly  secretary to Nero, and was slain on the fourteenth [or fifteenth] of  Domitian, after he had been for a good while in banishment; but another  Epaphroditas, a freed-man, and procurator of Trajan, as says Grotius on  Luke 1:3.\"    [3] The preservation of Homer's Poems by memory, and not by his own  writing them down, and that thence they were styled Rhapsodies, as sung  by him, like ballads, by parts, and not composed and connected  together in complete works, are opinions well known from the ancient  commentators; though such supposal seems to myself, as well as to  Fabricius Biblioth. Grace. I. p. 269, and to others, highly improbable.  Nor does Josephus say there were no ancienter writings among the Greeks  than Homer's Poems, but that they did not fully own any ancienter  writings pretending to such antiquity, which is trite.    [4] It well deserves to be considered, that Josephus here says how all  the following Greek historians looked on Herodotus as a fabulous author;  and presently, sect. 14, how Manetho, the most authentic writer of the  Egyptian history, greatly complains of his mistakes in the Egyptian  affairs; as also that Strabo, B. XI. p. 507, the most accurate  geographer and historian, esteemed him such; that Xenophon, the  much more accurate historian in the affairs of Cyrus, implies that  Herodotus's account of that great man is almost entirely romantic. See  the notes on Antiq. B. XI. ch. 2. sect. 1, and Hutchinson's Prolegomena  to his edition of Xenophon's, that we have already seen in the note on  Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 10. sect. 3, how very little Herodotus knew about  the Jewish affairs and country, and that he greatly affected what we  call the marvelous, as Monsieur Rollin has lately and justly determined;  whence we are not always to depend on the authority of Herodotus, where  it is unsupported by other evidence, but ought to compare the other  evidence with his, and if it preponderate, to prefer it before his. I do  not mean by this that Herodotus willfully related what he believed to  be false, [as Cteeias seems to have done,] but that he often wanted  evidence, and sometimes preferred what was marvelous to what was best  attested as really true.    [5]About the days of Cyrus and Daniel.    [6] It is here well worth our observation, what the reasons are that  such ancient authors as Herodotus, Josephus, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#11)"],[1,"add gradually one cup rich milk,  put in double boiler, and cook until thick. Let cool, flavor with  vanilla, then pour into rich crusts, previously well-baked, cover with  meringue made from the egg-whites, set in oven to harden, and serve hot  or cold.    _Raspberry Cream Pie_: (Leslie Fox.) Line a deepish pie pan with very  rich crust, spread the crust thickly with red raspberry jam, then pour  upon it raw, a custard made from two eggs beaten well with one cup of  milk, and one tablespoonful sugar. Bake until custard is well set, let  cool, and spread with whipped cream. Serve cold as possible.    _Rhubarb Pie_: To a generous quart of rhubarb, peeled and cut up, put  three cups sugar, the pulp scooped from three sweet oranges, thin bits  of the yellow peel, two blades of mace broken small, and a scant  half-cup of cold water. Cover the pan and set for thirty minutes in a  hot oven--uncover then and cook for five minutes longer. The result is a  sweet excellent for many uses--as a sauce, as a substitute for  marmalade, as the foundation of pies, tarts, shortcakes, even as a  filling for layer cake.    Make pies from it with two crusts, or with lattice crusts as usual. Make  it into tarts, into turnovers or put between hot buttered layers for a  hurry-up shortcake. But if you wish to know how excellent such rhubarb  can be, make it thus into meringue pies or tarts. Bake the crusts after  pricking them well, cover thinly with either good meringue or the  frosting directed for cheesecakes, let it harden, then at the minute of  serving cover with a thin layer of the prepared rhubarb--the meringue or  frosting will stay crisp until eaten if you work quickly enough. Young  unpeeled tender rhubarb gives a pink sauce--older stalks peeled furnish  a translucent green. Either is sufficiently decorative. They can be made  more so, if the tarts they appear on, have a cherry or preserved  strawberry dropped in the middle of them.    _Banana Pie_: Line a deepish earthen pie dish with thin, very good  crust, fill it three parts with bananas, sliced crosswise very thin.  Cover them thickly with sugar, add the strained juice of a large lemon,  dot with bits of butter, put on a lattice crust, and bake in a quick  oven twenty-five minutes.    _Banana Pudding_: Slice very thin, crosswise, three medium size bananas,  sprinkle thickly with sugar, then add to a batter made by beating up  four egg-yolks and two whites, with one cup crumbled rich stale cake,  half-cup sugar, cup very rich milk, and the juice of a large lemon. Mix  smooth, pour into a deep pudding dish, and bake in a quick oven, then  cover with meringue made from the egg-whites left out, beaten up with a  small pinch of salt, two teaspoons cold water, and six tablespoonfuls of  sugar. Return to the oven and let barely color. Serve hot or cold.    _Sweet Potato Pudding_: Beat four eggs very light with four cups sugar  and one cup creamed butter. Add a cupful of very rich milk, mix smooth,  then add one pint of raw grated sweet potato. Mix well, pour into a deep  earthen dish and set in hot oven. As soon as a brown crust forms on top,  stir it down. Repeat this three times at least. Serve hot, with either  wine sauce or a rich sugar and butter sauce, flavored with lemon. It is  best not to flavor the pudding proper, so one may get undiminished the  zest of the brown crust stirred through it.    _Poor Man's Pudding_: Take for each person to be served, a fresh egg, a  tablespoonful sifted flour, and half a cup very rich milk. Add a pinch  of salt for each six eggs. Separate the eggs, beating yolks and whites  very light. Mix yolks gradually with the flour and milk, taking care to  have no lumps. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites at the very last--if  the batter is too thick add a little more milk. Pour into a deep pan,  and bake in a quick oven. It must be taken up the moment it is done or  it will fall, and be ruined. Serve immediately, with a sauce made by  working together over hot water three cups sugar, one cup butter, half a  cup boiling water, cup fruit juice, wine or whiskey, with any flavoring  approved. The sauce cannot be made too rich, the pudding should be a  pale clear yellow, as light as a puff, and cutting easily with a spoon.  It is not \"true to name\" in these days of costly eggs, but deserved it  in the pioneer epoch which originated it.    _Boiled Batter Pudding_: Make the same batter as above, only putting in  a teaspoonful baking powder. Stir well through it three cups seeded  raisins, wet in whiskey and very well floured. Tie up in a newly-scalded  floured pudding bag, pop in a kettle of boiling water, keep it full,  with more boiling water, and cook from an hour to an hour and a half,  according to size. Serve very hot with plenty of very rich sweet sauce  highly flavored, and be sure to warm your knife or spoon before cutting  into the pudding.    _Apple Pudding_: (M. W. Watkins.) Core and peel half a dozen tart  apples, slice crosswise, put the slices in layers in a deep dish with  plenty of sugar, butter in reason, cinnamon and a very little water.  Pour over a batter made thus: one egg beaten light with half a cup  sugar, butter the size of a walnut, half a cup milk, pinch of salt,  flour enough to make thick enough for layer cake, with a teaspoonful  baking powder sifted through. Spread batter smooth, dot with bits of  butter on top, and bake in a brisk, but not scorching oven, half an  hour or longer if needed--the apples must be thoroughly cooked. Serve  hot or cold--preferably hot, with hard sauce or wine sauce.    _Apple Dumplings_: Pare and core half a dozen tart apples, stick three  cloves in each, fill the core-spaces full of very sweet hard sauce,  stick a sliver of mace in the sauce, then set each apple on a round of  good short paste, and work the paste up over it, joining the edges neat  and trig. Set close in a pan just big enough, pour around a half cup of  sugar melted in a cup of water with a little butter and lemon juice.  Cover the pan and cook quickly until done--then uncover, brown, take up  and serve piping hot with a very rich hard sauce.    _Crumb Pudding_: (Anne McVay.) Soak a cup of dry grated bread crumbs in  half a pint of milk until soft, add then the well-beaten yolks of two  eggs, half a cup sugar, tablespoonful butter, and another half-pint  milk. Flavor with lemon, vanilla or brandy, as preferred. Bake until  firm in a quick, but not scorching hot oven, cover with meringue made  from the egg-whites and half a cup of sugar. Barely color the meringue.  Let cool, and serve with either whipped or sweetened cream, or a fruit  sauce. Good without any sauce.    _Blackberry Mush_: (Leslie Fox.) Wash after picking a quart of fresh,  very ripe blackberries, put them on with barely enough water to save  from burning, bring to a good boil, and skim clean, then add gradually  almost two pounds of flour, or cornstarch well wet with cold water, also  sugar to taste. Cook, stirring often till the mass looks thick and  glossy, pour into your pudding dish, let cool, chill thoroughly, and  serve with cream either plain, or whipped, or sweetened.    _Peach Pudding_: Beat light one egg, with half a cup sugar, two  tablespoonfuls melted butter, three-quarters cup flour, one cup sour  cream, one teaspoon soda dissolved in one teaspoonful cold water, and  two cups very ripe peaches, peeled and sliced thin. Bake quickly and  serve when very hot with a rich hard or a wine sauce.    _Ginger Pudding_: Beat three eggs very light with two cups sugar, a  large cup rich black molasses, three-quarters cup butter, creamed,  tablespoon ginger beaten fine. Half a cup rich sour cream, half a cup  boiling water with teaspoon soda dissolved in it, add flour enough to  make a thickish batter, pour into deep greased pan, and bake quickly.  Serve hot with rich sauce that is flavored with some orange juice and  peel.    _Nesselrode Pudding_: (Mrs. H. Barker.) Boil together three cups sugar,  one cup water until the syrup ropes. Beat it boiling hot into the yolks  of six eggs previously beaten very light. Fold in the stiffly beaten  whites, then add box Cox's gelatine dissolved in warm water, one cup  raisins, seeded, steamed and soaked in sherry or whiskey, one cup of  nuts rolled small, else one cup of crumbled macaroons, or a cup of both  mixed. Finish with enough thick cream to make a full gallon, pack in  salt and ice, freeze and let stand long enough to ripen.    _Thanksgiving Pudding_: (Mrs. J. O. Cook.) Beat light the yolks of four  eggs with one cup sugar, two tablespoonfuls creamed butter, and one cup  of stale cake crumbs, soaked in eight tablespoonfuls whiskey. Mix well,  then add one cup raisins, seeded and floured, one cup nut meats, cut  small. Beat smooth and bake until set, then cover with meringue. Serve  with whipped cream or any sauce preferred. Milk can take the place of  whiskey, and preserves replace raisins.    _Real Christmas Pudding_: Toast a pint of fine breadcrumbs to a good  brown without burning, pour on them half a cup of strong, clear black  coffee, and let stand till soft.    Beat six egg-yolks very light with two cups of yellow sugar and one of  creamed butter, add the soaked crumbs and mix very smooth. Meantime,  soak a cup of raisins, seeded and halved, a cup of clean currants, a cup  of shredded citron, a cup of nut meats broken small, in a tumbler of  sherry, a tumbler of rum, and wineglass of apricot brandy. Add the fruit  when well soaked to the eggs and sugar, putting in any surplus liquors.  Mix in gradually a teaspoonful of cinnamon, the same of cloves and  allspice, half a cup of preserved ginger sliced very thin, and a very  tiny dusting of black pepper and paprika. Beat smooth, then fold in the  stiffly beaten egg-whites alternately with a cup of browned flour. If  too thick to stir handily thin with a little milk or boiling water. Pour  into a clean pudding bag, freshly scalded, leaving room for the"]]]
