Many times during the  hours I was there, drinks and wine were brought in that I did not order,  but the girls would insist that I had ordered it. Once in a while the  'madame' of the place would call in the room, and coming up to me would  embrace me and tell me I was a jolly fellow. I could not now recognize  any of the girls and do not know which saloon I went into. I live in  this city.\"      As a matter of custom, detectives were placed upon the case after the  discharge of the prisoner, but that was the last ever heard of the  matter, as he was unable to identify any of the parties arrested.    The foregoing is only a sample of hundreds of similar cases constantly  taking place, in some of which the sufferer, if he is a stranger, and  has no friends, is oftentimes sent to the Island for ten days for being  drunk, while the pretty waiter girl who has drugged, robbed and finally  discarded him is never even arrested. There are many other cases,  however, in which the pretty waiter girl does not fare so well, and  after conviction has to serve out her time, thereby losing her lover and  her liberty.    What has been written applies more especially to the concert-saloon  waiter girl, and does not in the least pertain to that other class of  girls who are found in what are called dance houses, of which latter  there are not a few in this city. There are some very peculiar kinds of  females to be found in dance houses and not to be met with outside the  abodes of Terpsichore. The term, dance house, itself, is susceptible  of various interpretations. It may mean anything from Harry Hill's, at  Crosby and Houston streets, to an Italian gathering in Mott or Mulberry  street. But the performances carried on are precisely alike in all. In  the sporting dance house, a series of boxing matches, small theatrical  sketches may be acted, a song or two interspersed, and some piano  playing, winding up afterwards with a dance, in which all so inclined  may indulge, taking either the regular girls employed in the house as  partners, or others who have strayed in from the streets.    In the regular dance houses, such as the Haymarket on Sixth avenue,  \"ladies\" are admitted free, but \"gentlemen\" are charged twenty-five  cents admittance, and here regular dancing takes place, such as  quadrilles, waltzes, etc. In the French Madame's on Thirty-first street,  which is ostensibly a restaurant, the girls come in from the street, and  while sipping black coffee, are ready to accept an engagement to dance  the _cancan_, which is performed up-stairs in rooms paid for by those  desiring to see the questionable performance. It is not infrequently  danced by the females in an entirely nude state, with various other  concomitants not to be mentioned here, but of such a nature as to  horrify any but the most _blase roue_. There is also the well-known  Billy McGlory's, in Hester street, near the Bowery, where general  dancing is indulged in until an early hour of the morning, when a  universal _cancan_ takes place upon the public floor, and where each  female boldly exposes just enough of her person to excite desire in the  beholder. These girls dance in ordinary street costumes, and in many  cases are paid by the proprietor for their services. It is a wild  debauch, and needs but to be seen once, to be ever afterward remembered  with disgust and loathing.    There are other places, not particularly dance houses nor yet  concert saloons, such as the Empire, Star and Garter, Gould's, etc.,  which are used as general places of resort by all classes of males and  Magdalenes. Here may be found the professional prize fighter, men about  town, gamblers, merchants, clerks, politicians, bankers, officials of  all kinds, and all classes of females, mistresses, _nymphs du pave_,  inmates of assignation houses, all intent on fun and dissipation, and a  desire to not only see the elephant, but pull it by the tail. Some of  the girls-haunting these places have been pretty waiter girls, but find  it more profitable to ply their trade as Cyprians. The bars are the  chief sources of profit in these as in kindred establishments. Hence  females are encouraged to visit them, for when they congregate in force  men will follow, and men who enter these places do so for the purpose of  finding congenial temporary mates and spending money for drinks.    Of the females who make these places their resort for the best part of  the night, and participate in the recklessness and debauchery that has  its ending only in an early death and the \"Potter's Field,\" nothing  remains to be said, except that they are the same as thousands leading  similar lives in other cities of the world. The victims first of man's  perfidy, through a too-confiding reliance on his promises, they become  so afterwards as a matter of business and livelihood. Each has her  lover, of course--what woman of the town has not?--and if she should  happen to make a little money in the way of her questionable business,  she divides it with him, for generally he has his eyes upon her during  the entire course of the evening. Very few of them will leave any of  these places with strange men without first notifying their lovers of  where they are going and how long they will be away. In return for these  services the lover sees to her, helps her to customers, prevents her  being imposed upon by others of her sex when in the dance houses or  concert saloons, and occasionally acts as her _cavalier servante_ to  various places for pleasure. There are many girls to be seen in these  dance houses who are not over fifteen years of age--and they have  lovers, too. In Billy McGlory's, one night, a desperate fight took place  there over two rival claimants for the regard of a girl not yet entered  on her teens.    It is considered one of the sights of the great city to visit these  up-town resorts. Here all the young swells who desire to show country  cousins the city, commercial travelers, chaperoned by city salesmen of  various business houses, chorus girls from the theaters, and a mixed  company generally, are to be found sitting around the various tables,  drinking. The atmosphere is foggy with cigar smoke. The saloon is all  ablaze with light. On the stage is some fourth-rate performer rendering  a popular song. There is a long lunch counter, upon which is placed the  materials for manufacturing all kinds of sandwiches. There is the flower  girl, with her tray of fresh pansies and roses, casting a reflected  bloom upon her otherwise pale face. There are the negro waiters ready to  pounce upon the first glass that is half-emptied of its contents, so  that its owner seeing no glass before him feels it incumbent to order  again. There are crowds of females--girls and women in street  costumes--some smoking cigarettes sitting poised on men's knees; others  at the tables quaffing stimulants like their male companions. There are  voices loud, mingled with the constant succession of orders for drinks  shouted out unpleasantly by the waiters. There is the sound of clinking  and jingling of glasses, the constant rapping on tables, boisterous  laughter, an occasional oath, and once in a while an hysterical scream,  as some unfortunate woman succumbs to the influence of rum. Above all  this is heard at intervals, the sound of music, as it squeezes itself  through the thick and sticky air. Men and women are continuously going  and coming, and all this drags on until daylight appears, and the  persons in the place, from sheer fatigue and exhaustion, seek some place  to sleep until the next night, when the females go through the same  scenes, with a new lot of the same kind of men. That is the up-town  place as it is to-day. The stories one hears are the same as those told  two thousand years ago. Woman's fall, man's perfidy, woman's frailty,  man's inhumanity form the themes, with drunkeness, depravity and  debauchery thrown in parenthetically.    Most of the proprietors of these up-town resorts are very prosperous and  would not countenance theft of any kind, nor permit any woman guilty of  it to come into their saloons if they knew them to be thieves. Persons  and property are comparatively as safe here as they can reasonably be  expected to be; but there are lots of persons who visit these places who  are known to be professional thieves and pickpockets, and while  apparently in the place for amusement, are really watching for some  unfortunate who, under the influence of drink, attempts to find his way  home alone. Such an individual is followed, and by one pretext or  another is robbed. Danger lurks in all these places for the man who  drinks. The temperate man is safe almost anywhere, but the temperate man  is not in the habit of visiting such places as have been described,  except--once in a while.        CHAPTER VI.    SHOP-LIFTERS.    _Who they are and how they are made--Their Methods of Operating and upon  whom--The Fashionable Kleptomaniac and her opposite--The Modern Devices  of Female Thieves._    Many persons contend that certain kinds of criminals inherit their  law-breaking propensities. There are others, less charitably disposed,  perhaps, who strenuously insist that all criminals, without exception,  are simply born with a natural desire to be bad, and would not be  otherwise if they could; that they are prone and susceptible to the  worst influences because they incline that way. There are others, again,  who as strongly and vigorously urge that felons, of whatever grade,  class or character, are made so by circumstances, in which poverty,  idleness, inability to obtain work, temptation, and a thousand other  things, conspire to be either the direct or indirect causes of the  individual falling from the straight path and entering the crooked path  of crime. But, from whatever motive, by whatever temptation, whether  forced or led, certain it is that both male and female criminals have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#11)"],[1,"it: he declared himself unequal to its duties, and begged the Pope to  appoint Fra Antonino in his stead. This request was granted, and Angelico  went on with his work as before, in all humility fulfilling his  heaven-born mission to lead men to better lives through the sweet  influence of his divine art.    The honor which had been tendered him was great--one which the noblest men  were striving for--but if he realized this he did not regret his decision,  neither was he made bold or vain by the royal tribute which the Pope had  paid him.    From this time the most important works of Fra Angelico were done in the  chapel of Pope Nicholas V., in the Vatican, and in the chapel which he  decorated in the Cathedral of Orvieto. He worked there one summer, and the  work was continued by Luca Signorelli. The remainder of his life was  passed so quietly that little can be told of it. It is not even known with  certainty whether he ever returned to Florence, and by some strange fate  the key to the chapel which he painted in the Vatican was lost during two  centuries, and the pictures could only be seen by entering through a  window. Thus it would seem that his last years were passed in the quiet  work which he best loved.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--AN ANGEL. _In the Uffizi, Florence. By Fra  Angelico._]    When his final illness was upon him, the brethren of Santa Maria Sopra  Minerva, where he resided, gathered about him, and chanted the _Salve  Regina_. He died on the 18th of February, 1455, when sixty-seven years  old. His tombstone is in the church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, in Rome;  on it lies the figure of a Dominican monk in marble. Pope Nicholas V.  wrote his epitaph in Latin. The following translation is by Professor  Norton:          \"Not mine be the praise that I was a second Apelles,         But that I gave all my gains to thine, O Christ!         One work is for the earth, another for heaven.         The city, the Flower of Tuscany, bore me--John.\"    In the Convent of San Marco in Florence there are twenty-five pictures by  this master; in the Academy of Florence there are about sixty; there are  eleven in the chapel of Nicholas V., and still others in the Vatican  gallery. The Church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence, the Cathedral of  Orvieto, the Church of St. Domenico in Perugia, and that of Cortona, are  all rich in his works. Besides these a few exist in some of the principal  European galleries; but I love best to see them in San Marco, where he  painted them for his brethren, and where they seem most at home.    The chief merit of the pictures of Fra Angelico is the sweet and tender  expression of the faces of his angels and saints, or any beings who are  holy and good; he never succeeded in painting evil and sin in such a way  as to terrify one; his gentle nature did not permit him to represent that  which it could not comprehend, and the very spirit of purity seems to  breathe through every picture.    Two other Florentine artists of the same era with Fra Angelico were  MASOLINO, whose real name was PANICALE, and TOMMASO GUIDI, called MASACCIO  on account of his want of neatness. The style of these two masters was  much the same, but Masaccio became so much the greater that little is  said of Masolino. The principal works of Masaccio are a series of frescoes  in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence. They represent \"The Expulsion from  Paradise,\" \"The Tribute Money,\" \"Peter Baptizing,\" \"Peter Curing the Blind  and Lame,\" \"The Death of Ananias,\" \"Simon Magus,\" and the \"Resuscitation  of the King's Son.\" There is a fresco by Masolino in the same chapel; it  is \"The Preaching of Peter.\" Masaccio was in fact a remarkable painter.  Some one has said that he seemed to hold Giotto by one hand, and reach  forward to Raphael with the other; and considering the pictures which were  painted before his time, his works are as wonderful as Raphael's are  beautiful. He died in 1429.    PAOLO UCCELLO (1396-1479) and FILIPPO LIPPI (1412-1469) were also good  painters, and SANDRO BOTTICELLI (1447-1515), a pupil of Filippo, was  called the best Florentine painter of his time. FILLIPINO LIPPI  (1460-1505) was a pupil of Botticelli and a very important artist. ANDREA  VERROCCHIO, LORENZO DI CREDI, and ANTONIO POLLAJUOLO were all good  painters of the Florentine school of the last half of the fifteenth  century.    Of the same period was DOMENICO GHIRLANDAJO (1449-1494), who ranks very  high on account of his skill in the composition of his works and as a  colorist. He made his pictures very interesting also to those of his own  time, and to those of later days, by introducing portraits of certain  citizens of Florence into pictures which he painted in the Church of Santa  Maria Novella and other public places in the city. He did not usually make  them actors in the scene he represented, but placed them in detached  groups as if they were looking at the picture themselves. While his scenes  were laid in the streets known to us, and his architecture was familiar,  he did not run into the fantastic or lose the picturesque effect which is  always pleasing. Without being one of the greatest of the Italian masters  Ghirlandajo was a very important painter. He was also a teacher of the  great Michael Angelo.    Other prominent Florentine painters of the close of the fifteenth century  were FRANCISCO GRANACCI (1477-1543), LUCA SIGNORELLI (1441-1521), BENOZZO  GOZZOLI (1424-1485), and COSIMO ROSSELLI (1439-1506).    Some good painters worked in Venice from the last half of the fourteenth  century; but I shall begin to speak of the Venetian school with some  account of the Bellini. The father of this family was JACOPO BELLINI  (1395-1470), and his sons were GENTILE BELLINI (1421-1507) and GIOVANNI  BELLINI (1426-1516).    The sketch-book of the father is one of the treasures of the British  Museum. It has 99 pages, 17 by 13 inches in size, and contains sketches of  almost everything--still and animal life, nature, ancient sculpture,  buildings and human figures, stories of the Scriptures, of mythology, and  of the lives of the saints are all illustrated in its sketches, as well as  hawking parties, village scenes, apes, eagles, dogs, and cats. In this  book the excellence of his drawing is seen; but so few of his works remain  that we cannot judge of him as a colorist. It is certain that he laid the  foundation of the excellence of the Venetian school, which his son  Giovanni and the great Titian carried to perfection.    The elder son, Gentile, was a good artist, and gained such a reputation by  his pictures in the great council-chamber of Venice, that when, in 1479,  Sultan Mehemet, the conqueror of Constantinople, sent to Venice for a good  painter, the Doge sent to him Gentile Bellini. With him he sent two  assistants, and gave him honorable conduct in galleys belonging to the  State. In Constantinople Gentile was much honored, and he painted the  portraits of many remarkable people. At length it happened that when he  had finished a picture of the head of John the Baptist in a charger, and  showed it to the Sultan, that ruler said that the neck was not well  painted, and when he saw that Gentile did not agree with him he called a  slave and had his head instantly struck off, to prove to the artist what  would be the true action of the muscles under such circumstances. This act  made Gentile unwilling to remain near the Sultan, and after a year in his  service he returned home. Mehemet, at parting, gave him many gifts, and  begged him to ask for whatever would best please him. Gentile asked but  for a letter of praise to the Doge and Signoria of Venice. After his  return to Venice he worked much in company with his brother. It is said  that Titian studied with Gentile: it is certain that he was always  occupied with important commissions, and worked until the day of his  death, when he was more than eighty years old.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--CHRIST. _By Gio. Bellini._]    But Giovanni Bellini was the greatest of his family, and must stand as the  founder of true Venetian painting. His works may be divided into two  periods, those that were done before, and those after he learned the use  of oil colors. His masterpieces, which can still be seen in the Academy  and the churches of Venice, were painted after he was sixty-five years  old. The works of Giovanni Bellini are numerous in Venice, and are also  seen in the principal galleries of Europe. He did not paint a great  variety of subjects, neither was his imagination very poetical, but there  was a moral beauty in his figures; he seems to have made humanity as  elevated as it can be, and to have stopped just on the line which  separates earthly excellence from the heavenly. He often painted the  single figure of Christ, of which Luebke says: \"By grand nobleness of  expression, solemn bearing, and an excellent arrangement of the drapery,  he reached a dignity which has rarely been surpassed.\" Near the close of  his life he painted a few subjects which represent gay and festive scenes,  and are more youthful in spirit than the works of his earlier years. The  two brothers were buried side by side, in the Church of SS. Giovanni e  Paolo, in Venice.    There were also good painters in Padua, Ferrara, and Verona in the  fifteenth century.    ANDREA MANTEGNA, of Padua (1430-1506), was a very important artist. He  spent the best part of his life in the service of the Duke of Mantua; but  his influence was felt in all Italy, for his marriage with the daughter of  Jacopo Bellini brought him into relations with many artists. His services  were sought by various sovereigns, whose offers he refused until Pope  Innocent VIII. summoned him to Rome to paint a chapel in the Vatican.  After two years there he returned to Mantua, where he died. His pictures  are in all large collections; his finest works are madonnas at the Louvre,  Paris, and in the Church of St. Zeno at Verona."]]]
