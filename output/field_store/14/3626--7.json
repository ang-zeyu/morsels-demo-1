APICIUS THE WRITER    Most of the Apician directions are vague, hastily jotted down,  carelessly edited. One of the chief reasons for the eternal  misunderstandings! Often the author fails to state the quantities to  be used. He has a mania for giving undue prominence to expensive  spices and other (quite often irrelevant) ingredients. Plainly,  Apicius was no writer, no editor. He was a cook. He took it for  granted that spices be used within the bounds of reason, but he could  not afford to forget them in his formulae.    Apicius surely pursues the correct culinary principle of incorporating  the flavoring agents during the process of cooking, contrary to many  moderns who, vigorously protesting against \"highly seasoned\" and  \"rich\" food, and who, craving for \"something plain\" proceed to  inundate perfectly good, plain roast or boiled dishes with a deluge of  any of the afore-mentioned commercial \"sauces\" that have absolutely no  relation to the dish and that have no mission other than to grant  relief from the deadening monotony of \"plain\" food. Chicken or mutton,  beef or venison, finnan haddie or brook trout, eggs or oysters thus  \"sauced,\" taste all alike--sauce! To use such ready-made sauces with  dishes cooked _a l'anglaise_ is logical, excusable, almost advisable.  Even the most ascetic of men cannot resist the insidiousness of spicy  delights, nor can he for any length of time endure the insipidity of  plain food sans sauce. Hence the popularity of such sauces amongst  people who do not observe the correct culinary principle of seasoning  food judiciously, befitting its character, without spoiling but rather  in enhancing its characteristics and in bringing out its flavor at the  right time, namely during coction to give the kindred aromas a chance  to blend well.    Continental nations, adhering to this important principle of cookery  (inherited from Apicius) would not dream of using ready-made (English)  sauces.    We have witnessed real crimes being perpetrated upon perfectly  seasoned and delicately flavored _entrees_. We have watched  ill-advised people maltreat good things, cooked to perfection, even  before they tasted them, sprinkling them as a matter of habit, with  quantities of salt and pepper, paprika, cayenne, daubing them with  mustards of every variety or swamping them with one or several of the  commercial sauce preparations. \"Temperamental\" chefs, men who know  their art, usually explode at the sight of such wantonness. Which  painter would care to see his canvas varnished with all the hues in  the rainbow by a patron afflicted with such a taste?    Perhaps the craving for excessive flavoring is an olfactory delirium,  a pathological case, as yet unfathomed like the excessive craving for  liquor, and, being a problem for the medical fraternity, it is only of  secondary importance to gastronomy.    To say that the Romans were afflicted on a national scale with a  strange spice mania (as some interpreters want us to believe) would be  equivalent to the assertion that all wine-growing nations were nations  of drunkards. As a matter of fact, the reverse is the truth.    Apicius surely would be surprised at some things we enjoy. _Voila_, a  recipe, \"modern,\" not older than half a century, given by us in the  Apician style or writing: Take liquamen, pepper, cayenne, eggs, lemon,  olive oil, vinegar, white wine, anchovies, onions, tarragon, pickled  cucumbers, parsley, chervil, hard-boiled eggs, capers, green peppers,  mustard, chop, mix well, and serve.    Do you recognize it? This formula sounds as phantastic, as \"weird\" and  as \"vile\" as any of the Apician concoctions, confusing even a  well-trained cook because we stated neither the title of this  preparation nor the mode of making it, nor did we name the ingredients  in their proper sequence. This mystery was conceived with an  illustrative purpose which will be explained later, which may and may  not have to do with the mystery of Apicius. Consider, for a moment,  this mysterious creation No. 2: Take bananas, oranges, cherries,  flavored with bitter almonds, fresh pineapple, lettuce, fresh peaches,  plums, figs, grapes, apples, nuts, cream cheese, olive oil, eggs,  white wine, vinegar, cayenne, lemon, salt, white pepper, dry mustard,  tarragon, rich sour cream, chop, mix, whip well.    Worse yet! Instead of having our appetite aroused the very perusal of  this quasi-Apician _mixtum compositum_ repels every desire to partake  of it. We are justly tempted to condemn it as being utterly  impossible. Yet every day hundreds of thousand portions of it are sold  under the name of special fruit salad with _mayonnaise mousseuse_. The  above mystery No. 1 is the justly popular tartar sauce.    Thus we could go on analyzing modern preparations and make them appear  as outlandish things. Yet we relish them every day. The ingredients,  obnoxious in great quantities, are employed with common sense. We are  not mystified seeing them in print; they are usually given in clear  logical order. This is not the style of Apicius, however.      LATIN CUNNING    We can hardly judge Apicius by what he has revealed but we rather  should try to discover what he--purposely or otherwise--has concealed  if we would get a good idea of the ancient kitchen. This thought  occurred to us at the eleventh hour, after years of study of the text  and after almost despairing of a plausible solution of its mysteries.  And it seems surprising that Apicius has never been suspected before  of withholding information essential to the successful practice of his  rather hypothetical and empirical formulae. The more we scrutinize  them, the more we become convinced that the author has omitted vital  directions--same as we did purposely with the two modern examples  above. Many of the Apician recipes are dry enumerations of ingredients  supposed to belong to a given dish or sauce. It is well-known that in  chemistry (cookery is but applied chemistry) the knowledge of the  rules governing the quantities and the sequence of the ingredients,  their manipulation, either separately or jointly, either successively  or simultaneously, is a very important matter, and that violation or  ignorance of the process may spell failure at any stage of the  experiment. In the kitchen this is particularly true of baking and  soup and sauce making, the most intricate of culinary operations.    There may have been two chief reasons for concealing necessary  information. Apicius, or more likely the professional collectors of  the recipes, may have considered technical elaboration of the formulae  quite superfluous on the assumption that the formulae were for  professional use only. Every good practitioner knows, with ingredients  or components given, what manipulations are required, what effects are  desired. Even in the absence of detailed specifications, the  experienced practitioner will be able to divine correct proportions,  by intuition. As a matter of fact, in cookery the mention in the right  place of a single ingredient, like in poetry the right word, often  suffices to conjure up before the gourmet's mental eye vistas of  delight. Call it inspiration, association of ideas or what you please,  a single word may often prove a guide, a savior.    Let us remember that in Apicii days paper (parchment, papyrus) and  writing materials were expensive and that, moreover, the ability of  correct logical and literary expression was necessarily limited in the  case of a practising cook who, after all, must have been the collector  of the Apician formulae. This is sufficiently proven by the _lingua  coquinaria_, the vulgar Latin of our old work. In our opinion, the  ancient author did not consider it worth his while to give anything  but the most indispensable information in the tersest form. This he  certainly did. A comparison of his literary performance with that of  the artistic and accomplished writer of the Renaissance, Platina, will  at once show up Apicius as a hard-working practical cook, a man who  knew his business but who could not tell what he knew.    Like ever so many of his successors, he could not refrain from  beginning and concluding many of his articles with such superfluities  as \"take this\" and \"And serve,\" etc., all of which shows him up as a  genuine cook. These articles, written in the most laconic language  possible--the language of a very busy, very harassed, very hurried  man, are the literary product of a cook, or several of them.    The other chief motive for condensing or obscuring his text has a more  subtle foundation. Indeed, we are surprised that we should possess so  great a collection of recipes, representing to him who could use them  certain commercial and social value. The preservation of Apicius seems  entirely accidental. Experienced cooks were in demand in Apicii times;  the valuation of their ministrations increased proportionately to the  progress in gastronomy and to the prosperity of the nation. During  Rome's frugal era, up to 200 B.C. the primitive cooks were just slaves  and household chattels; but the development of their trade into an  art, stimulated by foreign precepts, imported principally from Greece,  Sicily and Asia Minor, opened up to the practitioners not only the  door to freedom from servitude but it offered even positions of wealth  with social and political standing, often arousing the envy, satire,  criticism of bona-fide politicians, journalists, moralists, satirists  and of the ever-present hordes of parasites and hangers-on.
