We tore down some of them and piled them up as a windbreak,  and bedded beneath it; but we all thought with aching regret of the  comfort of the camp gear we'd abandoned. The going had gotten good and  rough.    That night remains in my mind as one of the most miserable in memory.  Except for the slight ringing in my ears, the height alone did not  bother me, but the others did not fare so well. Most of the men had  blinding headaches, Kyla's slashed side must have given her considerable  pain, and Kendricks had succumbed to mountain-sickness in its most  agonizing form: severe cramps and vomiting. I was desperately uneasy  about all of them, but there was nothing I could do; the only cure for  mountain-sickness is oxygen or a lower altitude, neither of which was  practical.    In the windbreak we doubled up, sharing blankets and body warmth: I took  a last look around the close space before crawling in beside Kendricks,  and saw the girl bedding down slightly apart from the others. I started  to say something, but Kendricks spoke, first. Voicing my thoughts.    \"Better crawl in with us, girl.\" He added, coldly but not unkindly, \"you  needn't worry about any funny stuff.\"    Kyla gave me just the flicker of a grin, and I realized she was  including me on the Darkovan side of a joke against this big man who was  so unaware of Darkovan etiquette. But her voice was cool and curt as she  said, \"I'm not worrying,\" and loosened her heavy coat slightly before  creeping into the nest of blankets between us.    It was painfully cramped, and chilly in spite of the self-heating  blankets; we crowded close together and Kyla's head rested on my  shoulder. I felt her snuggle closely to me, half asleep, hunting for a  warm place; and I found myself very much aware of her closeness,  curiously grateful to her. An ordinary woman would have protested, if  only as a matter of form, sharing blankets with two strange men. I  realized that if Kyla had refused to crawl in with us, she would have  called attention to her sex much _more_ than she did by matter-of-factly  behaving as if she were, in fact, male.    She shivered convulsively, and I whispered, \"Side hurting? Are you  cold?\"    \"A little. It's been a long time since I've been at these altitudes,  too. What it really is--I can't get those women out of my head.\"    Kendricks coughed, moving uncomfortably. \"I don't understand--those  creatures who attacked us--all women--?\"    I explained briefly. \"Among the people of the Sky, as everywhere, more  females are born than males. But the trailmen's lives are so balanced  that they have no room for extra females within the Nests--the cities.  So when a girl child of the Sky People reaches womanhood, the other  women drive her out of the city with kicks and blows, and she has to  wander in the forest until some male comes after her and claims her and  brings her back as his own. Then she can never be driven forth again,  although if she bears no children she can be forced to be a servant to  his other wives.\"    Kendricks made a little sound of disgust.    \"You think it cruel,\" Kyla said with sudden passion, \"but in the forest  they can live and find their own food; they will not starve or die. Many  of them prefer the forest life to living in the Nests, and they will  fight away any male who comes near them. We who call ourselves human  often make less provision for our spare women.\"    She was silent, sighing as if with pain. Kendricks made no reply except  a non-committal grunt. I held myself back by main force from touching  Kyla, remembering what she was, and finally said, \"We'd better quit  talking. The others want to sleep, if we don't.\"           *       *       *       *       *    After a time I heard Kendricks snoring, and Kyla's quiet even breaths. I  wondered drowsily how Jay would have felt about this situation--he who  hated Darkover and avoided contact with every other human being, crowded  between a Darkovan free-Amazon and half a dozen assorted roughnecks. I  turned the thought off, fearing it might somehow re-arouse him in his  brain.    But I had to think of something, anything to turn aside this  consciousness of the woman's head against my chest, her warm breath  coming and going against my bare neck. Only by the severest possible act  of will did I keep myself from slipping my hand over her breasts, warm  and palpable through the thin sweater, I wondered why Forth had called  me undisciplined. I couldn't risk my leadership by making advances to  our contracted guide--woman, Amazon or whatever!    Somehow the girl seemed to be the pivot point of all my thoughts. She  was not part of the Terran HQ, she was not part of any world Jay Allison  might have known. She belonged wholly to Jason, to my world. Between  sleep and waking, I lost myself in a dream of skimming flight-wise along  the tree roads, chasing the distant form of a girl driven from the Nest  that day with blows and curses. Somewhere in the leaves I would find her  ... and we would return to the city, her head garlanded with the red  leaves of a chosen-one, and the same women who had stoned her forth  would crowd about and welcome her when she returned. The fleeing woman  looked over her shoulder with Kyla's eyes; and then the woman's form  muted and Dr. Forth was standing between us in the tree-road, with the  caduceus emblem on his coat stretched like a red staff between us.  Kendricks in his Spaceforce uniform was threatening us with a blaster,  and Regis Hastur was suddenly wearing Space Service uniform too and  saying, \"Jay Allison, Jay Allison,\" as the tree-road splintered and  cracked beneath our feet and we were tumbling down the waterfall and  down and down and down....    \"Wake up!\" Kyla whispered, and dug an elbow into my side. I opened my  eyes on crowded blackness, grasping at the vanishing nightmare. \"What's  the matter?\"    \"You were moaning. Touch of altitude sickness?\"    I grunted, realized my arm was around her shoulder, and pulled it  quickly away. After awhile I slept again, fitfully.           *       *       *       *       *    Before light we crawled wearily out of the bivouac, cramped and stiff  and not rested, but ready to get out of this and go on. The snow was  hard, in the dim light, and the trail not difficult here. After all the  trouble on the lower slopes, I think even the amateurs had lost their  desire for adventurous climbing; we were all just as well pleased that  the actual crossing of Dammerung should be an anticlimax and uneventful.    The sun was just rising when we reached the pass, and we stood for a  moment, gathered close together, in the narrow defile between the great  summits to either side.    Hjalmar gave the peaks a wistful look.    \"Wish we could climb them.\"    Regis grinned at him companionably. \"Sometime--and you have the word of  a Hastur, you'll be along on that expedition.\" The big fellows' eyes  glowed. Regis turned to me, and said warmly, \"What about it, Jason? A  bargain? Shall we all climb it together, next year?\"    I started to grin back and then some bleak black devil surged up in me,  raging. When this was over, I'd suddenly realized, I wouldn't be there.  I wouldn't be anywhere. I was a surrogate, a substitute, a splinter of  Jay Allison, and when it was over, Forth and his tactics would put me  back into what they considered my rightful place--which was nowhere. I'd  never climb a mountain except now, when we were racing against time and  necessity. I set my mouth in an unaccustomed narrow line and said,  \"We'll talk about that when we get back--if we ever do. Now I suggest we  get going. Some of us would like to get down to lower altitudes.\"    The trail down from Dammerung inside the ridge, unlike the outside  trail, was clear and well-marked, and we wound down the slope, walking  in easy single file. As the mist thinned and we left the snow-line  behind, we saw what looked like a great green carpet, interspersed with  shining colors which were mere flickers below us. I pointed them out.    \"The treetops of the North Forest--and the colors you see are in the  streets of the Trailcity.\"    An hour's walking brought us to the edge of the forest. We travelled  swiftly now, forgetting our weariness, eager to reach the city before  nightfall. It was quiet in the forest, almost ominously still. Over our  head somewhere, in the thick branches which in places shut out the  sunlight completely, I knew that the tree-roads ran crisscross, and now  and again I heard some rustle, a fragment of sound, a voice, a snatch of  song.    \"It's so dark down here,\" Rafe muttered, \"anyone living in this forest  would _have_ to live in the treetops, or go totally blind!\"    Kendricks whispered to me, \"Are we being followed? Are they going to  jump us?\"    \"I don't think so. What you hear are just the inhabitants of the  city--going about their daily business up there.\"    \"Queer business it must be,\" Regis said curiously, and as we walked  along the mossy, needly forest floor, I told him something of the  trailmen's lives. I had lost my fear. If anyone came at us now, I could  speak their language, I could identify myself, tell my business, name my  foster-parents. Some of my confidence evidently spread to the others.    But as we came into more and more familiar territory, I stopped abruptly  and struck my hand against my forehead.    \"I knew we had forgotten something!\" I said roughly, \"I've been away  from here too long, that's all. Kyla.\"    \"What about Kyla?\"    The girl explained it herself, in her expressionless monotone. \"I am an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163"],[0,"Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers (#11)"],[1,"down the rocky stairways till we reach  quite a broad plateau that forms something like the shoulder of the  mountain. On the brink of this there are many large hemlocks, and we  scan them closely and rap upon them with our ax. But not a bee is seen  or heard; we do not seem as near the tree as we were in the fields  below; yet if some divinity would only whisper the fact to us we are  within a few rods of the coveted prize, which is not in one of the large  hemlocks or oaks that absorb our attention, but in an old stub or stump  not six feet high, and which we have seen and passed several times  without giving it a thought. We go farther down the mountain and beat  about to the right and left and get entangled in brush and arrested by  precipices, and finally as the day is nearly spent, give up the search  and leave the woods quite baffled, but resolved to return on the morrow.  The next day we come back and commence operations in an opening in  the woods well down on the side of the mountain, where we gave up the  search. Our box is soon swarming with the eager bees, and they go back  toward the summit we have passed. We follow back and establish a new  line where the ground will permit; then another and another, and yet the  riddle is not solved. One time we are south of them, then north, then  the bees get up through the trees and we cannot tell where they go. But  after much searching, and after the mystery seems rather to deepen than  to clear up, we chance to pause beside the old stump. A bee comes out of  a small opening, like that made by ants in decayed wood, rubs its eyes  and examines its antennae as bees always do before leaving their hive,  then takes flight. At the same instant several bees come by us loaded  with our honey and settle home with that peculiar low complacent buzz  of the well-filled insect. Here then is our idyl, our bit of Virgil and  Theocritus, in a decayed stump of a hemlock tree. We could tear it open  with our hands, and a bear would find it an easy prize, and a rich one  too, for we take from it fifty pounds of excellent honey. The bees have  been here many years, and have of course sent out swarm after swarm  into the wilds. They have protected themselves against the weather and  strengthened their shaky habitation by a copious use of wax.    When a bee-tree is thus \"taken up\" in the middle of the day, of course a  good many bees are away from home and have not heard the news. When they  return and find the ground flowing with honey, and piles of bleeding  combs lying about, they apparently do not recognize the place, and their  first instinct is to fall to and fill themselves; this done, their next  thought is to carry it home, so they rise up slowly through the branches  of the trees till they have attained an altitude that enables them to  survey the scene, when they seem to say, \"Why, this is home,\" and down  they come again; beholding the wreck and ruins once more they still  think there is some mistake, and get up a second or a third time and  then drop back pitifully as before. It is the most pathetic sight of  all, the surviving and bewildered bees struggling to save a few drops of  their wasted treasures.    Presently, if there is another swarm in the woods, robber-bees appear.  You may know them by their saucy, chiding, devil-may-care hum. It is  an ill wind that blows nobody good, and they make the most of the  misfortune of their neighbors; and thereby pave the way for their own  ruin. The hunter marks their course and the next day looks them up. On  this occasion the day was hot and the honey very fragrant, and a line of  bees was soon established S. S. W. Though there was much refuse honey in  the old stub, and though little golden rills trickled down the hill from  it, and the near branches and saplings were besmeared with it where we  wiped our murderous hands, yet not a drop was wasted. It was a feast to  which not only honey-bees came, but bumble-bees, wasps, hornets, flies,  ants. The bumble-bees, which at this season are hungry vagrants with  no fixed place of abode, would gorge themselves, then creep beneath the  bits of empty comb or fragments of bark and pass the night, and renew  the feast next day. The bumble-bee is an insect of which the bee-hunter  sees much. There are all sorts and sizes of them. They are dull and  clumsy compared with the honey-bee. Attracted in the fields by the  bee-hunter's box, they will come up the wind on the scent and blunder  into it in the most stupid, lubberly fashion.    The honey-bee that licked up our leavings on the old stub belonged to a  swarm, as it proved, about half a mile farther down the ridge, and a few  days afterward fate overtook them, and their stores in turn became the  prey of another swarm in the vicinity, which also tempted Providence  and were overwhelmed. The first mentioned swarm I had lined from several  points, and was following up the clew over rocks and through gulleys,  when I came to where a large hemlock had been felled a few years before  and a swarm taken from a cavity near the top of it; fragments of the old  comb were yet to be seen. A few yards away stood another short, squatty  hemlock, and I said my bees ought to be there. As I paused near it I  noticed where the tree had been wounded with an ax a couple of feet from  the ground many years before. The wound had partially grown over, but  there was an opening there that I did not see at the first glance. I  was about to pass on when a bee passed me making that peculiar shrill,  discordant hum that a bee makes when besmeared with honey. I saw it  alight in the partially closed wound and crawl home; then came others  and others, little bands and squads of them heavily freighted with honey  from the box. The tree was about twenty inches through and hollow at  the butt, or from the ax mark down. This space the bees had completely  filled with honey. With an ax we cut away the outer ring of live wood  and exposed the treasure. Despite the utmost care, we wounded the comb  so that little rills of the golden liquid issued from the root of the  tree and trickled down the hill.    The other bee-tree in the vicinity, to which I have referred, we found  one warm November day in less than half an hour after entering the  woods. It also was a hemlock, that stood in a niche in a wall of hoary,  moss-covered rocks thirty feet high. The tree hardly reached to the top  of the precipice. The bees entered a small hole at the root, which was  seven or eight feet from the ground. The position was a striking one.  Never did apiary have a finer outlook or more rugged surroundings. A  black, wood-embraced lake lay at our feet; the long panorama of the  Catskills filled the far distance, and the more broken outlines of the  Shawangunk range filled the rear. On every hand were precipices and a  wild confusion of rocks and trees.    The cavity occupied by the bees was about three feet and a half long and  eight or ten inches in diameter. With an ax we cut away one side of the  tree and laid bare its curiously wrought heart of honey. It was a most  pleasing sight. What winding and devious ways the bees had through their  palace! What great masses and blocks of snow-white comb there were!  Where it was sealed up, presenting that slightly dented, uneven surface,  it looked like some precious ore. When we carried a large pail full of  it out of the woods, it seemed still more like ore.    Your native bee-hunter predicates the distance of the tree by the time  the bee occupies in making its first trip. But this is no certain guide.  You are always safe in calculating that the tree is inside of a mile,  and you need not as a rule look for your bee's return under ten minutes.  One day I picked up a bee in an opening in the woods and gave it honey,  and it made three trips to my box with an interval of about twelve  minutes between them; it returned alone each time; the tree, which I  afterward found, was about half a mile distant.    In lining bees through the woods, the tactics of the hunter are to  pause every twenty or thirty rods, lop away the branches or cut down the  trees, and set the bees to work again. If they still go forward, he goes  forward also and repeats his observations till the tree is found or till  the bees turn and come back upon the trail. Then he knows he has passed  the tree, and he retraces his steps to a convenient distance and tries  again, and thus quickly reduces the space to be looked over till the  swarm is traced home. On one occasion, in a wild rocky wood, where the  surface alternated between deep gulfs and chasms filled with thick,  heavy growths of timber and sharp, precipitous, rocky ridges like a  tempest tossed sea, I carried my bees directly under their tree, and  set them to work from a high, exposed ledge of rocks not thirty feet  distant. One would have expected them under such circumstances to have  gone straight home, as there were but few branches intervening, but  they did not; they labored up through the trees and attained an altitude  above the woods as if they had miles to travel, and thus baffled me for  hours. Bees will always do this. They are acquainted with the woods only  from the top side, and from the air above they recognize home only by  land-marks here, and in every instance they rise aloft to take their  bearings. Think how familiar to them the topography of the forest  summits must be-an umbrageous sea or plain where every mask and point is  known.    Another curious fact is that generally you will get track of a bee-tree  sooner when you are half a mile from it than when you are only a few  yards. Bees, like us human insects, have little faith in the near at  hand; they expect to make their fortune in a distant field, they are  lured by the remote and the difficult, and hence overlook the flower and  the sweet at their very door. On several occasions I have unwittingly  set my box within a few"]]]
