How did tobacco affect the men who went to the            Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?          CHAPTER XIX.    WASTED MONEY.      COST OF ALCOHOL.    [Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what  alcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a  great deal of money. Money spent for that which will do no good, but  only harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.    If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save  a dollar.    You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar. What  would the beer-drinker do with it? If he takes two mugs of beer a day,  the dollar will be used up in ten days. But we ought not to say used,  because that word will make us think it was spent usefully. We will say,  instead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.    If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost  more. If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not  so often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched. We should not need so  many policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now. If no liquor was  drunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.      COST OF TOBACCO.    Most of you have a little money of your own. Perhaps you earned a part,  or the whole of it, yourselves. You are planning what to do with it, and  that is a very pleasant kind of planning.    Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little  roll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?  That would be wasting it, you say! (_See Frontispiece._)    Yes! it would be wasted, if thus burned. It would be worse than wasted,  if, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it. If you  should buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could  soon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.    Can you count a million? Can you count a hundred millions? Try some day  to do this counting. Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six  hundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent  in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than  wasted.    Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any  good to the world by the change?      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. How may one waste money?              2.

They regarded the noisy bell with hatred and invincible  suspicion. But for that, they would probably have put the red cow's  horns to the test, and in all likelihood the career of the lonely  alien would have come to an end ere the snow fell. As it was, however,  the black bull-calf never saw a bear in any attitude save that of  sulkily slinking away from his mother's neighbourhood; and therefore,  in that first summer of his life, he conceived a very dangerous  contempt for bears. As for the lynxes,--those soundless-footed, gray  shadows of the wild,--neither he nor his mother ever saw them, so  fearful were they of the voice of the bell. But their screeches and  harsh caterwaulings often filled his heart with wonder. Fear he had as  yet had no occasion to learn; and therefore he had little real part in  the ever-watchful life of the wilderness.    The next winter was a hard one for all the beasts of the Quah-Davic;  and, ere it went by, the lair under the hemlocks was surrounded by  many lynx tracks. But to neither red cow nor black calf did tracks  carry much significance, and they had no thought for the perils that  begirt them. Once, indeed, even the two panthers came, and turned upon  them pale, bright, evil eyes. But they did not come very near. The cow  shook her horns at them defiantly; and the calf shook his broadening,  curly forehead at them; and wild were the clamours of the vigilant  bell. The hearts of the hunting beasts turned to water at these  incomprehensible voices. In their chagrin they shifted their range  farther east; and for several years they came no more to the  water-meadows of the Quah-Davic.    Late in the following summer, when the fireweed was beginning to  crimson the open spaces on the hillside, fate came to the  water-meadows in a form which the bell was powerless to avert. An  Indian, paddling down the Quah-Davic to the sea, caught sight of the  red cow drinking by the waterside. He knew there was no settlement  within leagues. He knew the cow was a stray, and therefore no man's  property. He knew he wanted fresh meat, to say nothing of cowhide for  moccasins and thongs. Up went his big smooth-bore muzzle-loader. There  was a deafening, clattering report, unlike the smart detonation of a  rifle. The little red cow fell on her knees, with a cough and a wild  clamour of the bell, then rolled over in the shallow, shimmering  water. With a whoop of exultation, the Indian thrust ashore; and, as  he did so, the black yearling, taught terror at last by the report and  by the human voice, broke from his covert in a willow thicket and  dashed wildly into the woods.    When he came back, hours later, the Indian had vanished, and, with  that strident bellow of his, from which the calf-bleat was not yet  quite gone, he trotted down the bank to look for his mother. But the  smell of fresh blood, and the red spectacle which he saw on the  pebbles of the river-beach, struck a new and madder terror into his  heart. With stiffly uplifted tail and staring eyes, he dashed away  again into the woods.    From that day he never again went near that particular meadow;  neither, though for days he called to her in his loneliness, did he  search any more for the mother who had so suddenly disappeared out of  his life. Standing on the edge of a bluff, in the fading sunset, he  would thrust his head and neck out straight and bellow his sonorous  appeal. Then he would stop and listen long for an answer. And as he  called, evening after evening in vain, a deeper, surer tone came into  his voice, a more self-reliant, masterful look into the lonely but  fearless eyes with which he surveyed the solitude.    Again came autumn to the Quah-Davic, with the pale blue smoke of  asters along the meadow-ledges, the pale gold glimmer of birches on  the slopes, and the wax-vermilion bunches of the rowan-berries  reflected in each brown pool. By this time the black bull was of the  stature of a well-grown two-year-old, massive in the shoulder, lean  and fine in limb and flank, with a cushion of dense, close, inky curls  between his horns. The horns themselves--very short, thick,  keen-pointed spikes of horns--were not set forward, but stood out  absolutely straight on either side of his broad black head. Young  though he was, he was an ominous figure to all the furtive eyes that  watched him, as he stood and bellowed from his bluff in the fading  sunset.    [Illustration: \"BUT THEY DID NOT COME VERY NEAR.\"]    About this time it was that the young bull began to find the solitude  more populous. Since the voice of the bronze bell was hushed, the wild  creatures were no longer held aloof. Hitherto the red squirrels and  the indifferent, arrogant porcupines were the only animals he had  noticed. But now he saw an occasional slim and snaky mink at its  fishing; or a red fox stealing down upon the duck asleep in the lily  patch; or a weasel craftily trailing one of the brown hares which  had of a sudden grown so numerous. All these strange little beasts  excited his curiosity. At first he would sniff, and snort, and  approach to investigate, which would lead, of course, to an immediate  and discouraging disappearance. Only the fox was too haughty to  disappear. He would maintain a judicious distance, but otherwise  seemed to regard the inquisitive bull with utter unconcern. This  unconcern, together with the musky smell of the bush-tailed red  stranger, at last so aggravated the bull that he charged furiously  again and again. But the fox eluded him with mocking ease, till the  bull at last sulkily ignored him.    The bull's next important acquaintance was the lynx. He was lying  under a scarlet maple, chewing his cud, and lazily watching a rabbit  scratching its ears some dozen paces distant. Suddenly a soundless  gray shadow shot from a thicket and dropped upon the rabbit. There was  a squeak, a feeble scuffle; and then a big lynx, setting the claws of  one paw into the prey, turned with a snarl and eyed venomously the  still, dark form under the maple. This seemed like a challenge. With a  mixture of curiosity and indignation, the young bull got up, grunted,  pawed the earth once or twice by way of ceremony, and emerged to the  encounter. But the lynx had no stomach to meet the charge of that  sturdy front. He snatched up the rabbit in his jaws and bounded away  into the underbrush.    A few days later, as the bull again lay under the scarlet maple and  looked out contemplatively over his yellow autumn world, a large bear  lumbered past, taking his own well-beaten trail to the waterside. The  bull lurched to his feet, and stood on guard, for this was a  formidable-looking stranger. But the bear, fed fat with autumn  berries, was at peace with all the world. He gave the black bull a  shrewd glance out of his little cunning eyes, and paid no further  attention; and the bull, seeing no incentive to a quarrel, snorted  doubtfully and lay down again. After this he saw several more bears,  but, being well fed and lazy, they made no effort to molest him. Then,  one unfortunate day, as he came up dripping from his favourite pool,  he met one face to face.    The bear was surprised, and halted. He half-settled back upon his  haunches, as if to turn aside and yield the path. Then he thought  better of it and held his ground, being at the moment good-natured  enough, but careful of his dignity, as a bear is apt to be. The young  bull, however, was enraged at this obstinate intrusion upon his trail.  He was unlucky enough to remember how often he had seen bears slink  off to avoid his mother's charge. With an angry bellow, he lifted his  tail, lowered his head, and launched himself upon the intruder.    The bear, poising himself upon three legs, gracefully and lightly  avoided the attack, and at the same instant delivered a terrific  buffet upon the young bull's neck. The blow struck low, where the  muscles were corded and massive, or the neck would have been broken.  As it was, the bull went staggering to his knees at one side of the  trail, the blood spurting from his wounds. In that moment he realized  that he was not yet a match for a full-grown bear. Smarting with pain  and wrath, he rushed on up the trail, and hid himself in the old lair  under the hemlock. When again, some days later, he met another bear,  he made haste to yield the right of way.    In the wild, as in the world, to be once beaten is to invite the fist  of fate. While the young bull's wounds were still red and raw, there  came a big-antlered, high-shouldered bull-moose to the bluff  overlooking the Quah-Davic. The moose was surprised at sight of the  short-legged, black animal on the bluff. But it was rutting season,  and his surprise soon gave way to indignation. The black bull, whose  careless eyes had not yet noticed the visitor, began to bellow as was  his evening wont. The moose responded with a hoarse, bleating roar,  thrashed the bushes defiantly with his antlers, and shambled up to the  attack. The bull, astonished and outraged, stood his ground boldly,  and at the first charge got in a daunting blow between the enemy's  antlers. But he was not yet strong enough or heavy enough to hold so  tough an antagonist, and, after a very few minutes of fierce grunting  and pushing, he was thrust clear over the bank and sent rolling down  into the river. All next day he sulked, but when night came he  returned to the bluff, his eyes red with rage. He found the moose  before him, but not alone. A tall, dingy-coloured, antlerless cow was  there, fondling her mate's neck and ears with her long, flexible  muzzle. This sight gave the young bull a new and uncomprehended fury,  under the impulse of which he would have attacked an elephant. But the  moose, thus interrupted in his wooing, was far more dangerous than he  had been the night before. Like a whirlwind of devastation he rushed  to meet the intruder; and the young bull was"]]]
