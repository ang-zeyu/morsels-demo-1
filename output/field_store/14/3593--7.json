But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If  he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That  was the thing he had set his heart upon.    And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter  past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.  Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the  tank.    His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on  his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to  overtake nine o'clock.    \"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice as near as he could  feign it. \"What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\"    \"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I _am_ behind my time.\"    \"You are!\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir,  if you please.\"    \"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. \"It  shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\"    \"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge. \"I am not going to  stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore I am about to raise  your salary!\"    \"A Merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could  not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back, \"A Merrier Christmas,  Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise  your salary, and endeavor to assist your struggling family, and we will  discuss your affairs this very afternoon. Make up the fires, and buy  another coal scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"    Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;  and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as  good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city  knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old  world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them  laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that  nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did  not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as  these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they  should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less  attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for  him.    He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total  Abstinence Principle, ever afterward; and it was always said of him,  that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the  knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny  Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!          THE CHRISTMAS BABE.    BY MARGARET E. SANGSTER.           We love to think of Bethlehem,               That little mountain town,         To which, on earth's first Christmas Day,               Our blessed Lord came down.         A lowly manger for His bed,               The cattle near in stall,         There, cradled close in Mary's arms,               He slept, the Lord of all.         If we had been in Bethlehem,               We too had hasted fain         To see the Babe whose little face               Knew neither care nor pain.         Like any little child of ours,               He came unto His own,         Through Cross and shame before Him stretched,--               His pathway to His Throne.         If we had dwelt in Bethlehem,               We would have followed fast,         And where the Star had led our feet               Have knelt ere dawn was past.         Our gifts, our songs, our prayers had been               An offering, as He lay,         The blessed Babe of Bethlehem,               In Mary's arms that day.         Now breaks the latest Christmas Morn!               Again the angels sing,         And far and near the children throng               Their happy hymns to bring.         All heaven is stirred! All earth is glad!               For down the shining way,         The Lord who came to Bethlehem,               Comes yet, on Christmas Day.          A WESTERN CHRISTMAS IN THE OLD DAYS.    BY MRS. W. H. CORNING.      Christmas week there was no school, but such a succession of dining  days, and visiting days, and day parties, and night parties, that Fanny,  who looked forward to the week as a season of rest, thought that the  regular routine of school duties would be less fatiguing.    Christmas at La Belle Prairie was the one jubilee of the year, something  to be talked about for six months beforehand, and to be remembered as  long after. It was a time of feasting and recreation for both master and  servant. Days before, preparations commenced in the kitchen. Various  smells issued from thence--savory smells of boiled, baked, and roasted  meats; and sweet delicious smells of warm pastry and steaming cakes.  Aunt Tibby was rolling pie-crust or stirring cake all day long, and the  chopping of sausage-meat, the pounding of spices, and the beating of  eggs were constantly heard. Everything was carried on with the greatest  secrecy. The children were all kept out of the kitchen, and when  \"somefin' good\" was to be transferred therefrom to Miss Car'line's  store-room, Aunt Tibby came sailing in, holding it high above the reach  of the curious little heads.    \"I don't care,\" said Cal. \"There's six pound-cakes all in a row on the  store-room shelf. I see 'em when ma opened the door; and Marthy says one  of 'em got currants in it, and there's a little shoat thar roasted  whole. O! how I wish Christmas was come.\"    Coming suddenly upon Maud one day, Fanny found her with her apron half  full of bran, while her fingers were busily at work upon a few pieces of  faded silk. Maud tried to hide them at first, but finding by Fanny's  question of \"What is it, Maud?\" that it was too late, she had looked up  with a tired, flushed face and said:    \"Miss Fanny, don't you tell now! will you? I'm makin' a pin-cushion for  Aunt Phoebe, but it won't come square, all I can do. It acts awfully.\"    \"Let me see what the trouble is,\" said Fanny, and sitting down, she  examined the poor cushion; which, indeed, under Maud's hands, was not  soon likely to come into shape.    \"You see,\" said Maud, \"I want to give aunty a Christmas gift, and I  thought a cushion would be so nice, 'cause her old one that she wears  pinned to her waist, you know, has burst a great hole, and the bran  keeps tumbling out. I'm going to make her a right nice one, only I wish  'twas brighter, 'cause aunty likes red, and yellow, and all them, so  bad.\"    Fanny searched her piece bag and brought forth bits of gay ribbon, the  sight of which threw Maud into ecstasies of delight, then giving up the  morning to the job, she cut and planned, and fitted and basted together,  getting all in order, so that Maud could do the sewing herself.    \"Aunty wouldn't think half so much of it if I didn't,\" said the child.    Well and faithfully Maud performed her labor of love, giving up her  much-prized runs on the prairie, and resisting all the children's  entreaties to play with them, till the Christmas gift was finished. It  was no small task, for Maud most heartily hated to sew, and her fingers  were anything but nimble in the operation. \"I always did despise to sew,  Miss Fanny,\" she said, \"but I'm going to make this cushion for aunty  anyhow.\"    It was finished at last, and, as Maud expressed it, \"was just as  beautiful as it could be.\" There never was a prouder, happier child. She  did not thank Fanny in words for her assistance, but that night she came  softly behind her, and putting her arms around her neck, gave her an  earnest kiss, a proceeding which called forth an exclamation of surprise  from Mrs. Catlett, for Maud was very chary of her caresses.    Christmas morning came, and long before daylight, every child upon the  place, both black and white, was up ready to \"march in Christmas.\" There  had been mysterious preparations the night before, such as the hiding of  tin pans and glass bottles under the bed, and the faint tooting of an  old horn, heard down at the quarters, as though some one was rehearsing  a part. Fanny was also astonished by an application from little \"darky  Tom\" for permission to use her school-bell, the said cow-tinkler not  being remarkable for sweetness of sound.    \"O, yes, Tom, you may take it; but what can you want of it?\"    \"Couldn't tell no ways, Miss Fanny,\" said Tom, with a grin. \"Mebbe Miss  Fanny know in de mornin'.\"    Morning did indeed bring an explanation of the mystery. Assembling in  the yard, the children marshaled themselves into marching order; Maud,  of course, being captain, and taking the lead, bearing an old tin horn,  while little black Tom brought up the rear with Fanny's unfortunate  cow-bell.    In this order they commenced \"marching in Christmas\" to the music of the  horn, the beating of tin pans, the rattling of bits of iron and pieces  of wood, the jingling of bells, and the clapping of hands. Into the  house, and up-stairs to the very doors of the sleeping-rooms, they all  marched with their horrid din. It was received with tolerable  good-humor by all but Nanny, who, deprived of her morning nap by the  tumult, raved at the juvenile disturbers of the peace, and finally threw  her shoes at them as they stood on the stairway. These were directly  seized upon as trophies, and carried off in triumph to the quarters,  where the young performers went through with the same operations.    \"Christmas gift! Christmas gift!\" was the first salutation from the  servants this morning, and it was well worth while to give them some  trifling present, were it only to hear their extravagant expressions of  gratitude and delight. It was impossible to forget for a moment that it  was Christmas. One could see it in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#11)"],[1," indicating the temperatures of the ingoing and  outcoming water, records with the electric-resistance thermometers for  the temperature of the air and the walls and the body temperatures, and  the deflections of the thermo-electric elements.    Numerous plans have been proposed for rendering automatic some of these  observations, as well as the control of the heating and cooling of the  air-circuits. Obviously, such a record of temperature measurements would  have two distinct advantages: (1) in giving an accurate graphic record  which would be permanent and in which the influence of the personal  equation would be eliminated; (2) while the physical observer at present  has much less to do than with the earlier form of apparatus, it would  materially lighten his labors and thereby tend to minimize errors in the  other observations.    The development of the thread recorder and the photographic registration  apparatus in recent years led to the belief that we could employ similar  apparatus in connection with our investigations in this laboratory. To  this end a number of accurate electrical measuring instruments were  purchased, and after a number of tests it was considered feasible to  record automatically the temperature differences of the ingoing and  outcoming water from the calorimeter. Based upon our preliminary tests,  the Leeds & Northrup Company of Philadelphia, whose experience with such  problems is very extended, were commissioned to construct an apparatus  to meet the requirements of the respiration calorimeter. The conditions  to be met by this apparatus were such as to call for a registering  recorder that would indicate the differences in temperature between the  ingoing and outcoming water to within 0.5 per cent and to record these  differences in a permanent ink line on coordinate paper. Furthermore,  the apparatus must be installed in a fixed position in the laboratory,  and connections should be such as to make it interchangeable with any  one of five calorimeters.    After a great deal of preliminary experimenting, in which the Leeds &  Northrup Company have most generously interpreted our specifications,  they have furnished us with an apparatus which meets to a high degree of  satisfaction the conditions imposed. The thermometers themselves have  already been discussed. (See page 30.) The recording apparatus consists  of three parts: (1) the galvanometer; (2) the creeper or automatic  sliding-contact; (3) the clockwork for the forward movement of the roll  of coordinate paper and to control the periodic movement of the creeper.    Under ordinary conditions with rest experiments in the chair calorimeter  or bed calorimeter, the temperature differences run not far from 2 deg. to  4 deg. Thus, it is seen that if the apparatus is to meet the conditions of  the specifications it must measure differences of 2 deg. C. to within 0.01  deg. C. Provision has also been made to extend the measurement of  temperature differences with the apparatus so that a difference of 8 deg.  can be measured with the same percentage accuracy.      FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE APPARATUS.    The apparatus depends fundamentally upon the perfect balancing of the  two sides of a differential electric circuit. A conventional diagram,  fig. 19, gives a schematic outline of the connections. The two  galvanometer coils, _fl_ and _fr_, are wound differentially and both  coils most carefully balanced so that the two windings have equal  temperature coefficients. This is done by inserting a small shunt _y_,  parallel with the coil _fl_, and thus the temperature coefficient of  _fl_ and _fr_ are made absolutely equal. The two thermometers are  indicated as T_{1} and T_{2} and are inserted in the ingoing and  outgoing water respectively. A slide-wire resistance is indicated by J,  and _r_ is the resistance for the zero adjustment. Ba, Z, and Z_{1} are  the battery and its variable series resistances. If T_{1} and T_{2} are  exactly of the same temperature, _i. e._, if the temperature difference  of the ingoing and outcoming water is zero, the sliding contact _q_  stands at 0 on the slide-wire and thus the resistance of the system from  0 through _fl_, _r_, and T_{1} back to the point C is exactly the same  as the resistance of the slide-wire J plus the coil _fr_ plus T_{2} back  to the point C. A rise in temperature of T_{2} gives an increase of  resistance in the circuit and the sliding contact _q_ moves along the  slide-wire toward J maximum until a balance is obtained.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Diagram of wiring of differential circuit with  its various shunts, used in connection with resistance thermometers on  water-circuit of bed calorimeter.]    Provision is made for automatically moving the contact _q_ by electrical  means and thus the complete balance of the two differential circuits is  maintained constant from second to second. As the contact _q_ is moved,  it carries with it a stylographic pen which travels in a straight line  over a regularly moving roll of coordinate paper, thus producing a  permanently recorded curve indicating the temperature differences. The  slide-wire J is calibrated so that any inequalities in the temperature  coefficient of the thermometer wires are equalized and also so that any  unit-length on the slide-wire taken at any point along the temperature  scale represents a resistance equal to the resistance change in the  thermometer for that particular change in temperature. With the varying  conditions to be met with in this apparatus, it is necessary that  varying values should be assigned at times to J and to _r_. This  necessitates the use of shunts, and the recording range of the  instrument can be easily varied by simple shunting, _i. e._, by changing  the resistance value of J and _r_, providing these resistances unshunted  have a value which takes care of the highest obtained temperature  variations.    Fig. 19 shows the differential circuit complete with all its shunts. S  is a fixed shunt to obtain a range on J; S' is a variable shunt to  permit very slight variations of J within the range to correct errors  due to changing of the initial temperatures of the thermometers; _y_ is  a permanent shunt across the galvanometer coil _fl_, to make the  temperature coefficients of _fl_ and _fr_ absolutely equal; Z is the  variable resistance in the battery-circuit to keep the current constant;  _r_ is a permanent resistance to fix the zero on varying ranges; S''  plus S_{1} constitutes a variable shunt to permit slight variations of  _r_ to finally adjust 0 after S' is fixed and _t_ is a permanent shunt  across the thermometer T_{1} to make the temperature coefficient of  T_{1} equal to that of T_{2}.    The apparatus can be used for measuring temperature differences from 0 deg.  to 4 deg. or from 0 deg. to 8 deg. When on the 0 deg. to 8 deg. range, the  shunt S is open-circuited and the shunt S' alone used. The value of S,  then, is predetermined so as to affect the value of the wire J and thus  halve its influence in maintaining the balance. Similarly, when the lower  range, _i. e._, from 0 deg. to 4 deg., is used, the resistance _r_ is  employed, and when the higher range is used another value to _r_ must be  given by using a plug resistance-box, in the use of which the resistance  _r_ is doubled.    The resistance S'' and S_{1} are combined in a slide-wire resistance-box  and are used to change the value of the whole apparatus when there are  marked changes in the position of the thermometric scale. Thus, if the  ingoing water is at 2 deg. C. and the outcoming water at 5 deg. C. in one  instance, and in another instance the ingoing water is 13 deg. and the  outgoing water is 15 deg., a slight alteration in the value of S_{1}, and  also of S', is necessary in order to have the apparatus draw a curve to  represent truly the temperature differences. These slight alterations  are determined beforehand by careful tests and the exact value of the  resistances in S' and in S_{1} are permanently recorded for subsequent  use.      THE GALVANOMETER.    The galvanometer is of the Deprez-d'Arsonval type and has a particularly  powerful magnetic field, in which a double coil swings suspended similar  to the marine galvanometer coils. This coil is protected from vibrations  by an anti-vibration tube A, fig. 20, and carries a pointer P which acts  to select the direction of movement of the recording apparatus, the  movable contact point _q_, fig. 19. In front of this galvanometer coil  and inclosed in the same air-tight metal case is the plunger contact Pl,  fig. 21. The galvanometer pointer P swings freely below the silver  contacts S_{1} and S_{2}, just clearing the ivory insulator _i_. The  magnet plunger makes a contact depending upon the adjustment of a clock  at intervals of 2 seconds. So long as both galvanometer coils are  influenced by exactly the same strength of current, the pointer will  stand in line with and immediately below _i_ and no current passes  through the recording apparatus. Any disturbance of the electrical  equilibrium causes the pointer P to swing either toward S_{1} or S_{2},  thus completing the circuit at either the right hand or the left hand,  at intervals of 2 seconds. The movement of the pointer away from its  normal position exactly beneath _i_ to either S_{1} on the left hand or  S_{2} on the right, results from an inequality in the current flowing  through the two coils in the galvanometer. The difference in the two  currents passing through these coils is caused by a change in  temperatures of the two thermometers in the water circuit.
