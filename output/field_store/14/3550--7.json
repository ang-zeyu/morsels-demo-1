Queen Isabella, according to Mrs. George, owes to some agreeable  qualities, but most of all to her patronage of Columbus, oblivion of  remarkable faults, which were prolific of evil to Spain. She escaped at  the expense of her husband Ferdinand, who has been charged with her sins  as well as his own. She was not a person to yield to any one where her  power and rights were in question, so that in all matters concerning  home policy, she is at least entitled to an equal share of the  discredit; and in the establishment of the Inquisition, and the  persecution of the Jews and Moors, she stands alone. Ferdinand was  always disposed to put his religion behind his interest, and was urged  by his wife into measures of which he disapproved; sometimes, indeed,  she ordered or permitted persecutions of which he was altogether  ignorant. Beside the wickedness of these things, their impolicy was not  less conspicuous. The oppression of the Moors, and the expulsion of both  Moors and Jews, destroyed the mechanical and commercial industry of  Spain; the overthrow of the feudal power and privileges of the nobility,  and the establishment of despotism in the crown, checked the growth of  civil freedom, as the introduction of the Inquisition induced religious  bigotry, and withered mental independence and intellectual cultivation.  Nor is Mrs. George disposed to allow weight to the excuse, urged in  favor of Isabella upon such facts as undeniably tell against her. The  Spaniards of the age, she says, were not so bigoted; the Kings of  Aragon, supported by their subjects, had set the Popes at defiance; the  Cortes of Aragon and of Valencia resisted the introduction of the  Inquisition; some of the clergy, with Fray Francisco de Talavera  Archbishop of Granada at their head, were opposed to all persecution;  even the Pope remonstrated against some wholesale slaughter; and when  persecution had provoked an insurrection, Ferdinand himself was wroth.  Nor does the biographer even see an excuse in the Queen's conscience.  When religion or churchmen stood in the way of her power or interests,  they were blown aside. There is in these conclusions, something of the  woman and of the Spaniard, anxious to excuse in any way the historical  degradation and present weakness of Spain. If the Spaniards were really  enterprising and industrious, there seems no reason why they might not  have engaged in commerce, agriculture, and the useful arts, although the  Jews and Moors were expelled: the Jews were ousted from England long  before they were driven from Spain, yet the English got on in the  absence of the house of Israel. The destruction of the enormous power of  the nobility was absolutely necessary, not only to the establishment of  order, but almost to the existence of society itself. It could only be  brought about by throwing the power of the common people into the scale  of the crown; and so far as Ferdinand and Isabella were concerned, it  seems to have been a wise and politic measure. The real despotism of the  crown was established by Charles the Fifth, and he might not have been  able to effect it, had he been only King of Spain. For the religious  tyranny, cruelty, and want of faith of Isabella in violating  stipulations, Mrs. George is sparing in the quotation of authorities,  and she often rather asserts than narrates in the account of facts that  would prove the case. A strict analysis might also show that temporal  power was the object aimed at, and religion a disguise for ambition. We  think, however, that the case of relentless and cruel persecution is  established against Isabella the Catholic; and that it was aggravated by  the power which the priesthood exercised over her mind in things  indifferent or which agreed with her inclination. In the graces of  person and manner, and in suavity of temper towards her own party, or  those whom she wished to gain, Isabella of Castile far excelled her  granddaughter Mary of England. In tenacity of purpose, in obstinacy, and  in indifference to the misery arising from their orders, it is possible  they were more alike than the world has supposed. And Isabella might  have had a similar cognomen, had not the Spaniards continued as bloody  as her age and as bigoted as herself.    The style of Mrs. George is in the main very good; but occasional  defects in diction and in the structure of sentences, are matters of  course in a woman who writes in a foreign language. There are some  points in the Queen's history passed over too lightly, and the  narrative is not always continuous. Isabella's relations with Columbus,  are barely noticed, on the ground that they had already been so largely  illustrated by Irving and Prescott. Miss Pardoe, who has edited an  English impression of the book, has supplied its most obvious defects  induced by this consideration.    Mrs. George has just left this country for Madrid, and we have reasons  for believing that she will devote the remainder of her life to  literature. She has in contemplation two works, both relating to Spain,  which can hardly fail under her spirited and ingenious treatment of  being eminently attractive. Since she is no longer in America, we may  gratify curiosity by remarking that she is some years under thirty, and  is one of the most beautiful and brilliantly-talking women of the  present day.           *       *       *       *       *    WE are gratified to learn that there is a prospect of the appearance of  the Memoirs and Inedited Works of our late eminent countryman HENRY  WHEATON, the ablest and faithfulest and worst-used diplomatic servant of  the United States in the present century. The last time this great man  visited New-York he passed several hours in our study, and we remember  that he said then that his Letters to the Secretary of the Smithsonian  Institute, his various Tracts, Reviews, Historical Essays, &c., which he  would wish to collect, would make some three or four volumes as large as  his work on \"The Law of Nations.\" He had also nearly or quite finished a  new work on the History of the Northmen, being a translation and  improvement of his _Histoire des Peuples du Nord_, published in Paris,  which was an extension of the volume he contributed originally to the  Family Library, in 1831, upon the same subject. This important work was  advertised, we believe, before the death of Mr. Wheaton, to be published  in two octavos, by the Appletons, but it has not yet been printed.           *       *       *       *       *    R. R. MADDEN'S \"Infirmities of Genius,\" a very pleasant book, is in the  press of Mr. J. S. Redfield. Madden is an Irishman, and he first became  known to the public by his \"Travels in Turkey,\" published about  twenty-five years ago. The \"Infirmities of Genius\" appeared in 1833, and  two American editions of the work have heretofore been printed. In 1835  Mr. Madden came to the United States, and in 1836-7-8-9, he filled the  office of Superintendent of Liberated Africans, and Commissioner of  Arbitration in the Mixed Court of Justice at Havana. His various  experiences and observations, during eight years of official and private  life in America, the West Indies, and Africa, led to the composition of  several tracts on the slave-trade, and a volume printed we think some  two years ago on \"the Island of Cuba, its Resources, Progress, and  Prospects.\" The \"Infirmities of Genius\" is, in a literary point of view,  his best production; and it is likely to retain a place among the  contributions of the age to standard English literature.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. E. H. CHAPIN, whose effective elocution and brilliant rhetoric  attract crowds to his ordinary discourses at the Universalist Church in  Murray-street, has in the press of Mr. J. S. Redfield, a volume upon  \"Womanhood, Illustrated by the Women of the New Testament\"--not treating  of these characters in the offensive style of the small rhetoricians,  but rather in that of Emerson's Representative Men, presenting Martha as  a type of the women of society, &c. We believe we have not before  referred in these pages to the fact, that Mr. Chapin was commonly  regarded as by far the finest orator in the recent Peace Congress at  Frankfort, in which were a large number of men from several nations  eminent for eloquence.           *       *       *       *       *    A DISCOVERY OF IMPORTANT HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS, according to a Chicago  paper, has recently been made among the manuscripts which were saved  from the pillage of the Jesuits' College in Quebec. \"It is well known by  those familiar with the resources of early American history, that the  publication of the Jesuit Relations, which furnish so much of interest  in regard to the discovery and early exploration of the region bordering  on our northern lakes, was discontinued after the year 1672. Some were  known to have been written, but the manuscripts were supposed to be  lost. The Relations from 1672 to 1679 inclusive, have lately been  discovered, and among them a manuscript containing a full account of the  voyages of Father Marquette, and of the discovery by him of the  Mississippi river. It was undoubtedly this manuscript which furnished  Thevenot the text of his publication in 1687, of 'The voyages and  discoveries of Father Marquette and of the Sieur Joliet.'

[Illustration: PLAN OF BATTLE OF ELANDSLAAGTE]    But this ruse was a failure and their triumph short-lived. The 1st  Battalion Devonshire Regiment, who, as we know, had been holding the  enemy in front during the commencement of the infantry attack, and had  since then pushed steadily forward, had now reached to 350 yards from  the enemy. Here they lay down to recover breath before charging with  fixed bayonets. Five companies assaulted the hill to the left and five  to the right; and a detachment of these, arriving at the critical moment  when the Boers were making their last stand, helped to bring about the  triumphant finale.    Like the lightning that shot through the sky above, the Boers, at the  sound of the united cheers, had fled! Some scampered away to their  laager on the Nek, and from thence to other kopjes. Others filed in  troops anywhere, regardless of consequences. While they were in full  retreat, and the mists of darkness, like a gathering pall, hung over the  scene, the 5th Lancers and the 5th Dragoon Guards charged the flying  enemy--charged not once nor twice only, but thrice, dashing through the  scattered ranks with deadly purpose, though at terrible risk of life and  limb. Never were Boers so amazed. The despised worms--the miserable  Rooineks--had at last turned, and, as one of them afterwards described  it, they had \"come on horses galloping, and with long sticks with spikes  at the end of them, picked us up like bundles of hay!\"    The cost of victory, however, was heavy. Roughly estimated, we lost 4  officers and 37 men killed; 31 officers and 175 men wounded. Ten men  were missing. The Boers lost over 300 Burghers killed and wounded,  besides several hundred horses. Their hospital with wounded prisoners  was placed under the care of the British hospital, they having only one  doctor, who, with his primitive staff, was quite unable to cope with the  arduous work of attending the multitude of sufferers.    Numbers of the enemy of all nationalities--Germans, Hollanders, Irish,  and others--were made prisoners, and among them were General de Koch and  Piet Joubert, nephew of General Joubert. General Viljoen was killed. The  mongrel force, estimated at about 1200 strong, was commanded by Colonel  Schiel, to whom it doubtless owed its excellent tactical disposition.  This officer was wounded and taken prisoner. The _Times_ gave somewhat  interesting character sketches of prominent Boers who were killed or  wounded on this occasion:--         \"General Koch was Minute-Keeper to the Executive, and was       President Kruger's most influential supporter. His son, Judge       Koch, was appointed to a seat on the Bench, but was not       popular, and was regarded as a puppet. The fighting Koch is not       to be confounded with the General Koch, who belongs to Vryheid,       and is a sterling warrior.         \"Advocate Coster was State Attorney at the time of the Reform       trials, but resigned owing to President Kruger having insulted       him at a meeting of the Executive. He was an accomplished man,       a member of the Inner Temple, and was very popular with the       Dutch Bar.         \"General Ben Viljoen was responsible for most of the       fire-eating articles which appeared in the _Rand Post_.\"         \"Colonel Schiel was court-martialled in past days for shooting       four natives whom he accused of insubordination.\"    The courage of the Boers during this battle was immense. About two  thousand were engaged, and these, though certainly aided by the strength  of their position, fought valiantly, facing doggedly the heavy  consummately well-directed fire of the British artillery, and returning  it with undiminished coolness.    An interesting incident is mentioned in connection with the battle. When  the fire of the British guns became overwhelming, eight plucky Boers  dashed forward from cover, and, standing together, steadily opened fire  on the men of the Imperial Light Horse, with the evident purpose of  drawing their fire, while their comrades should change position. Out of  this gallant little band, only one man was left to tell the tale!    [Illustration: THE BATTLE OF ELANDSLAAGTE--CHARGE OF THE 5th LANCERS.    Drawn by R.

The following tribute to the memory of Colonel Scott Chisholme is taken  from Mr. John Stuart's correspondence to the _Morning Post_:--    \"No death has been more severely felt than the Colonel's. He was a good  man and a good soldier, brave to the point of recklessness, a  wonderfully-inspiriting leader, and, as I judged from about  a month's knowledge of him, single-minded, fervent in all his work,  passionately in earnest. His regiment almost worshipped him. On the day  of the fight their keenness was increased because he was keen, and they  ignored the hardships they had gone through because he shared them and  took them lightly, and did his best to improve matters.    \"During the fight he only took cover once or twice, going from troop to  troop, praising and encouraging the men in words that were always well  chosen, for no man could phrase his blame or praise more aptly. At the  last ridge he stopped to tie up the leg of a wounded trooper, and was  shot himself in the leg. Two of his men went to his assistance, but he  waved them off, telling them to go on with their fighting and to leave  him alone. Then he was shot in one of the lungs, and the men went to his  help, but while they were trying to get him to cover, a bullet lodged in  his head and killed him. The last words he was heard to say were, 'My  fellows are doing well.' His fellows will always remember that.    \"I may be allowed to recall one or two interesting recollections of the  Colonel. One is the speech he delivered when the Maritzburg Club dined  him and his officers. Both he and General Symons spoke. Neither man was  an orator, and yet each was more convincing than many orators, speaking  simple, soldierly, purposeful words, words whose simplicity drove them  home. Almost a week before the battle I saw the Colonel arranging his  camp. He had taken off his tunic and helmet, and did twice as much  direction as any other officer, and he worked as hard as any of the men.  It was then, when I saw his vigour in full activity, that I realised his  wonderful capacity for work--a capacity of which I had often heard, but  which I had not been able to comprehend before.    \"The last time I saw him was at the outspan before the battle began. He  came to a group of us and gave one or two orders in such pleasant words  that one knew that to obey him must in itself be a real delight. Then he  sat down and gossiped with us, first about his luck in the morning, when  a shell that hit the ground between his horse's feet had failed to  burst, and afterwards about luck in general. He advised the officers to  tell their men to sleep while they could, and then he said, 'Now I'll go  and get half-an-hour's sleep myself.' But at that moment an aide-de-camp  came saying that General French wanted to see him. When the Colonel  returned, it was to order his regiment to saddle up and prepare to  mount. In half-an-hour he was leading the attack on the first kopje.    \"I like to think that before death smote him he knew that the battle was  won, and that his fellows had done well, as he expected that they would,  as he had helped them to do by example and generous encouragement.\"    A private of the Gordon Highlanders, in a letter dated Ladysmith,  November 2, gave a vivid account of the charge of "]]]
