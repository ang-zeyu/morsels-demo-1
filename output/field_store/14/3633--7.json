They  grow about 1 _mm._ long, divide themselves, by successively rising  partitions, into some prominent cylindrical linked cells, and then  their growth is ended, and the upper cell produces near its point  three to six branches almost standing rectangularly. Of these the  under ones are the longest, and they again shoot forth from under  their ends one or more still shorter little branches. The nearer they  are to the top, the shorter are the branches, and less divided; the  upper ones are quite branchless, and their length scarcely exceeds the  breadth of the principal stem. Thus a system of branches appears, upon  which, on a small scale, a bunch of grapes is represented. All the  twigs soon end their growth; they all separate their inner space from  the principal stem, by means of a cross partition placed close to it.  All the ends, and also that of the principal stem, swell about the  same time something like a bladder, and on the upper free half of each  swelling appear again, simultaneously, several fine protuberances,  close together, which quickly grow to little oval bladders filled with  protoplasm, and resting on their bearers with a sub-sessile,  pedicellate, narrow basis, and which at length separate themselves  through a partition as in _Aspergillus_. The detached cells are the  conidia of our fungus; only one is formed on each stalk. When the  formation is completed in the whole of the panicle, the little  branches which compose it are deprived of their protoplasm in favour  of the conidia; it is the same with the under end of the principal  stem, the limits of which are marked by a cross partition. The  delicate wall of these parts shrinks up until it is unrecognizable;  all the conidia of the panicle approach one another to form an  irregular grape-like bunch, which rests loosely on the bearer, and  from which it easily falls away as dust. If they be brought into water  they fall off immediately; only the empty, shrivelled, delicate skins  are to be found on the branch which bore them, and the places on which  they are fixed to the principal stem clearly appear as round  circumscribed hilums, generally rather arched towards the exterior.  The development of the main stem is not ended here. It remains solid  and filled with protoplasm as far as the portion which forms the end  through its conidia. Its end, which is to be found among these pieces,  becomes pointed after the ripening of the first panicle, pushes the  end of the shrivelled member on one side, and grows to the same length  as the height of one or two panicles, and then remains still, to form  a second panicle similar to the first. This is later equally  perfoliated as the first, then a third follows, and thus a large  number of panicles are produced after and over one another on the same  stem. In perfect specimens, every perfoliated panicle hangs loosely to  its original place on the surface of the stem, until by shaking or the  access of water to it, it falls immediately into the single conidia,  or the remains of branches, and the already-mentioned oval hilums are  left behind. Naturally, the stem becomes longer by every perfoliation;  in luxuriant specimens the length can reach that of some lines. Its  partition is already, by the ripening of the first panicle from the  beginning of its foundation, strong and brown; it is only colourless  at the end which is extending, and in all new formations. During all  these changes the filament remains either unbranched, except as  regards the transient panicles, or it sends out here and there, at the  perfoliated spots, especially from the lower ones, one or two strong  branches, standing opposite one another and resembling the principal  stem.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--_Polyactis cinerea._ _a._ Apex of hypha.]    The mycelium, which grows so exuberantly in the leaf, often brings  forth many other productions, which are called _sclerotia_, and are,  according to their nature, a thick bulbous tissue of mycelium  filaments. Their formation begins with the profuse ramification of the  mycelium threads in some place or other; generally, but not always, in  the veins of the leaf; the intertwining twigs form an uninterrupted  cavity, in which is often enclosed the shrivelling tissue of the leaf.  The whole body swells to a greater thickness than that of the leaf,  and protrudes on the surface like a thickened spot. Its form varies  from circular to fusiform; its size is also very unequal, ranging  between a few lines and about half a millimetre in its largest  diameter. At first it is colourless, but afterwards its outer layers  of cells become round, of a brown or black colour, and it is  surrounded by a black rind, consisting of round cells, which separate  it from the neighbouring tissue. The tissue within the rind remains  colourless; it is an entangled uninterrupted tissue of fungus  filaments, which gradually obtain very solid, hard, cartilaginous  coats. The sclerotium, which ripens as the rind becomes black, loosens  itself easily from the place of its formation, and remains preserved  after the latter is decayed.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--_Peziza Fuckeliana._ _a._ Natural size. _b._  Section enlarged. _c._ Ascus and sporidia.]    The sclerotia are, here as in many other fungi, biennial organs,  designed to begin a new vegetation after a state of apparent quietude,  and to send forth special fruit-bearers. They may in this respect be  compared to the bulbs and perennial roots of under shrubs. The usual  time for the development of the sclerotia is late in the autumn,  after the fall of the vine leaves. As long as the frost does not set  in, new ones continually spring up, and each one attains to ripeness  in a few days. If frost appears, it can lie dry a whole year, without  losing its power of development. This latter commences when the  sclerotium is brought into contact with damp ground during the usual  temperature of our warmer seasons. If this occur soon, at the latest  some weeks after it is ripe, new vegetation grows very quickly,  generally after a few days; in several parts the colourless filaments  of the inner tissue begin to send out clusters of strong branches,  which, breaking through the black rind, stretch themselves up  perpendicularly towards the surface, separate from one another, and  then take all the characteristics of the conidia-bearers. Many such  clusters can be produced on one sclerotium, so that soon the greater  part of the surface is covered by filamentous conidia-bearers with  their panicles. The colourless tissue of the sclerotium disappears in  the same degree as the conidia-bearers grow, and at last the black  rind remains behind empty and shrivelled. If we bring, after many  months, for the first time, the ripe sclerotium, in damp ground, in  summer or autumn, after it has ripened, the further development takes  place more slowly, and in an essentially different form. It is true  that from the inner tissue numerous filamentous branches shoot forth  at the cost of this growing fascicle, and break through the black  rind, but its filaments remain strongly bound, in an almost parallel  situation, to a cylindrical cord, which for a time lengthens itself  and spreads out its free end to a flat plate-like disc. This is always  formed of strongly united threads, ramifications of the cylindrical  cord. On the free upper surface of the disc, the filaments shoot forth  innumerable branches, which, growing to the same height, thick and  parallel with one another, cover the before-named disc. Some remain  narrow and cylindrical, are very numerous, and produce fine hairs  (paraphyses); others, also very numerous, take the form of club-like  ampulla cells, and each one forms in its interior eight free swimming  oval spores. Those ampulla cells are sporidiiferous asci. After the  spores have become ripe, the free point of the utricle bursts, and the  spores are scattered to a great distance by a mechanism which we will  not here further describe. New ampullas push themselves between those  which are ripening and withering; a disc can, under favourable  circumstances, always form new asci for weeks at a time. The number of  the already described utricle-bearers is different, according to the  size of the sclerotium; smaller specimens usually produce only one,  larger two to four. The size is regulated by that of the sclerotia,  and ranges, in full-grown specimens, between one and more millimetres  for the length of the stalk, and a half to three (seldom more)  millimetres for the breadth of the disc.[q] For some time the conidia  form, belonging to the Mucedines, has been known as _Botrytis cinerea_  (or _Polyactis cinerea_). The compact mycelium, or sclerotium, as an  imperfect fungus, bore the name of _Sclerotium echinatum_, whilst to  the perfect and cup-like form has been given the name of _Peziza  Fuckeliana_. We have reproduced De Bary's life-history of this mould  here, as an illustration of structure in the _Mucedines_, but  hereafter we shall have to write of similar transformations when  treating of polymorphism.    The form of the threads, and the form and disposition of the spores,  vary according to the genera of which this order is composed. In  _Oidium_ the mostly simple threads break up into joints. Many of the  former species are now recognized as conditions of _Erysiphe_. In  _Aspergillus_, the threads are simple and erect, with a globose head,  around which are clustered chains of simple spores. In _Penicillium_,  the lower portion of the threads is simple, but they are shortly  branched at the apex, the branches being terminated by necklaces of  minute spores. In _Dactylium_, the threads are branched, but the  spores are collected in clusters"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#11)"],[1,"established--one-half day in each week devoted by each member to the  work in its sewing-rooms, with a woman in charge to prepare it. The  clothing was given out to them as received by us. Many a basket came  proudly back to show us the difference between \"den an' now\"--good,  strong, firmly mended garments. Ragged coats and pants disappeared from  among the men, as no longer \"'spectable fo' de fambly.\"    Provision was also made that the little girls from ten years old should  attend and be taught to sew. Many a little dress was selected at  headquarters for them to make over or repair.    I wish I could do fitting justice to the band of women volunteers who  stood by me through those long months. Some had commenced with me when  society belles, years before, now mistresses of their own palatial  homes; some had come from under the old historic elms of Boston, and  some from the hard-fought fields of Britain's Africa, and wearing the  Victoria Cross. To them, white and black were the same, and no toil too  hard or too menial.    The money contributed and received for the entire relief of ten months  was thirty thousand five hundred, and a few additional dollars and cents  which I do not at this moment recall. It aggregated one dollar apiece  for the entire maintenance of thirty thousand persons for ten months.    It is the general custom in this part of the country for the merchants  to furnish supplies to their patrons, and wait until the gathering of  the crops for their pay. But when we left these people at the beginning  of their harvest, not one family in twenty-five had contracted a debt  for supplies: an experience before unknown in their history.    A report was made and passed into the hands of our legal counsellor,  who, on seeing that no change could be truthfully made in it, advised  that it be not published, as no one would believe it possible to be  done, and we would get only distrust and discredit. Having now come to a  pass where distrust and discredit are no longer to be feared by the Red  Cross, we ourselves are free to make the statement. But back of the hard  facts there is compensation.    A half dozen years later, when our negro proteges of the Sea Islands  heard of the disaster that had fallen upon Galveston, they at once  gathered for aid and sent in their contributions.    \"'Cause dey suffers like we did, and de Red Cross is dar,\" they said.    Of course I would not permit one dollar of this holy gift to Galveston  to go to other than the hands, hard, bony, and black--such as had raised  it in their penury. I also wanted it to do more. Searching for the most  reliable colored people in the city I found in the superintendent of the  colored schools a man who had occupied that place for many years, and  who had the respect and confidence of the people of Galveston. I asked  him to consult his foremost women teachers, and if it pleased them, to  form a society and fit themselves to receive a little money.    In about a week he appeared with his deputation. I informed them that I  had a little money from their own people of the Sea Islands for them;  that they had been chosen to receive it, because as teachers of the  children they would have access to the needs and conditions of the  families. I told them that I had desired to do more than merely make a  gift for distribution. I wished to plant a tree. I could have given them  their peach, which they would eat, enjoy, and throw the pit away. But I  wished them to plant the pit, and let it raise other fruit for them, and  for that reason I had asked the formation of this society.    They all sat quiet a few moments, the tears were on their faces. At  length their president, the school superintendent, spoke for them:    \"Miss Barton,\" he said, \"we all appreciate this, and in the name of all  I promise you that the pit shall be reverently planted, and I trust the  time will come when I can tell you that our tree is not only bearing  fruit for ourselves, but for all suffering brethren, as theirs have done  for us.\"    I then handed them the check for $397. The moment seemed sacred when  these poor dark figures, struggling toward the light, walked out of my  presence. The pit has been successfully planted in Galveston, and we are  from time to time informed of its bearing.          VII    ARMENIAN RELIEF    1896      Leaving the Port Royal field past midsummer of 1894, after an absence of  nearly a year--at a day's notice--the remainder of the autumn and winter  was scarcely less occupied in the details which had been unavoidably  overlooked. Before spring our correspondence commenced to enlarge with  rumors of Armenian massacres, and so excited and rapid was the increase  that, so far as actual labor, consultation, and thought were concerned,  we might as well have been on a field of relief.    Unfortunately, the suspicions of the Turkish Government had fallen upon  the resident missionaries, both English and American, as favoring the  views and efforts of its anarchistic population, or the \"young Turks,\"  as they were designated. This had the effect of placing the missionaries  in danger, confining them strictly to their own quarters, preventing  all communication and the receiving of any funds sent them from abroad.    England had a large waiting fund which it could not distribute, and  appealed to the American Missionary Boards of Boston and New York, to  find them equally powerless. The need of funds among the missionaries  throughout Turkey was getting painfully urgent, and as a last resort it  was suggested from Constantinople that the Red Cross be asked to open  the way.    A written request from the Rev. Judson Smith, D.D., of Boston, was  nearly identical with one received by us from Mr. Spencer Trask, of New  York, who with others was about to form a national Armenian relief  committee, to be established in that city.    Following these communications, both of these eminent gentlemen, Mr.  Smith and Mr. Trask, came in person to urge our compliance with their  request that the Red Cross accept the charge and personally undertake  the doubtful and dangerous task of distributing the waiting funds among  the missionaries in Turkey.    As Mr. Trask was to take the lead in the formation of a committee for  the raising of funds, his interest was naturally paramount, and his  arguments in favor of our acceptance were wellnigh irresistible.  Immediate action on the part of some one was imperative. Human beings  were starving, and could not be reached. Thousands of towns and villages  had not been heard from since the massacres, and only the Red Cross  could have any hope of reaching them. No one else was prepared for field  work; it had its force of trained field workers. Turkey was one of the  signatory powers to the Red Cross Treaty. Thus it was hoped and believed  that she would the more readily accept its presence.    These are mere examples of the reasons urged by the ardent advocates of  the proposed committee, until at length we came to consider its  acceptance, on conditions which must be clearly understood. First, we  must not be expected to take any part in, or to be made use of, in the  raising of funds--one of our fundamental rules being never to ask for  funds--we did not do it for ourselves.    Second, there must be perfect unanimity between themselves. We must be  assured that every one wanted us to go. Our part would be hard enough  then; and finally we must be sure they had some funds to distribute.    Of the amount of these funds no mention was made by us, and I remember a  feeling of good-natured amusement as I heard the officers of this  untried effort at raising funds speak of \"millions.\" It was easy to  discern that they were more accustomed to the figures of a banking  establishment than a charity organization dependent on the raising of  funds. They were likely to be disappointed. In reality, the amount, so  there were something to go with, made very little difference to us, as  we were merely to place what was entrusted to us where most needed, and  when that was done we had but to return. We never named any amount as  preferable to us.    The means resorted to in raising the funds were unfortunate. In the  great public meetings called for that purpose the utmost indiscretion  prevailed in regard to language applied to Turkey and the Turkish  Government. This aroused the indignation of the Turkish officials, who  very reasonably took measures to have our entrance into Turkey  forbidden.    A date of sailing, however, had been given Mr. Trask, and his committee,  feeling that any change would be detrimental to their efforts, no change  was made, and we sailed on time, to find in England no permission, and  further efforts necessary. With time and patience the troublesome  effects of these mistakes were overcome, and Constantinople was reached,  and a heavenly welcome by the harassed missionaries awaited us.    The first step was to procure an introduction to the Turkish Government,  which had in one sense refused to see me. Accompanied by the American  Minister, Hon. A. W. Terrell, and his premier interpreter, Gargiulo, one  of the most experienced diplomatic officers in Constantinople, I called  by appointment upon Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Minister of Foreign  Affairs, or Minister of State. To those conversant with the personages  connected with Turkish affairs, I need not say that Tewfik Pasha is  probably the foremost man of the government--a manly man, with a kind,  fine face, and genial, polished manners. Educated abroad, with advanced  views on general subjects, he impresses one as a man who would sanction  no wrong it was in his power to avert.    Mr. Terrell's introduction was most appropriate and well expressed,  bearing with strong emphasis upon the suffering condition of the people  of the interior, in consequence of the massacres, the great sympathy of  the people of America, and giving assurance "]]]
