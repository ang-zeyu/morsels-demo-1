[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],[0,"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#11)"],[1," for  close relationship between the _Hyla leucophyllata_ and _Hyla  microcephala_ groups.    In Mexico and northern Central America two small species, _Hyla picta_  and _Hyla smithi_, comprise the _Hyla picta_ group. These frogs  resemble members of the _Hyla microcephala_ group by having a  yellowish tan dorsum with a dorsolateral white stripe and uniformly  yellow thighs. Furthermore the mating call is not unlike those of  the species in the _Hyla microcephala_ group. Despite these  similarities, the _Hyla picta_ group differs from the _Hyla  microcephala_ group by having a well-developed quadratojugal that  connects to the maxillary, tadpoles with teeth present and caudal fins  completely enclosing the caudal musculature, and a haploid number of  12 chromosomes. In all of these characteristics the frogs of the    _Hyla picta_ group more closely resemble other Middle American _Hyla_  than they do the _Hyla microcephala_ group. Therefore, it can best be  presumed that the superficial resemblances of coloration and the  mating call are the result of convergence.    Since the _Hyla microcephala_ and _leucophyllata_ groups apparently  are related and since the greatest diversity of these frogs is in  South America (if _Hyla misera_ and its relatives are placed with the  _Hyla microcephala_ group), it seems appropriate to place the centers  of origins of these groups in South America. Therefore, the _Hyla  microcephala_ group and _Hyla ebraccata_ of the _Hyla leucophyllata_  group either have immigrated into Central America, or they are  representatives of those groups that were isolated in Central America  during most of the Cenozoic when South America was separated from  Central America.    The interspecific relationships of the species in the _Hyla  microcephala_ group are not clear. On the basis of coloration, _H. m.  microcephala_ and _H. robertmertensi_ are close, and _H. m. underwoodi_  and _H. phlebodes_ are nearly identical. The mating calls of _H.  phlebodes_ and _sartori_ closely resemble one another, whereas the call  of _robertmertensi_ is intermediate between these and _microcephala_.    In most respects _Hyla microcephala_ is distinct from the other  species, and with the exception of the amount of ossification of the  frontoparietals, the other species can be easily derived from a  _microcephala_-like ancestor. Possibly the slightly increased  ossification of the frontoparietals in _robertmertensi_, _phlebodes_,  and _sartori_ is secondary, or possibly after differentiation of the  species the amount of ossification was further reduced in  _microcephala_. If so, the species fall into a reasonable phylogenetic  scheme that has _microcephala_ as the extant species most like the  ancestral stock.    We visualize the evolutionary history of the group to have followed  a course that began with the invasion of Central America by a  _microcephala_ ancestral stock that differentiated into two populations  in lower Central America--a _microcephala_-like frog on the Pacific  lowlands and a _phlebodes_-like frog on the Caribbean lowlands.  Differentiation could have been brought about by isolation by montaine  or marine barriers. The population on the Pacific lowlands either was  preadapted for subhumid conditions or became so adapted and dispersed  northward onto the Pacific lowlands of northern Central America.  Simultaneously the frogs on the Caribbean lowlands, which were adapted  to humid environments, dispersed northward in the humid forested  regions to southern Mexico and crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec onto  the Pacific slopes of Oaxaca and Guerrero northward to Jalisco.  Subsequent development of arid conditions, possibly in the Pliocene,  Pleistocene, or even as late as the Thermal Maximum in post-Wisconsin  time, resulted in a restriction of the ranges in northern Central  America, thereby isolating part of the _phlebodes_-stock on the  Pacific slopes of Mexico, where it adapted to drier conditions and  evolved into _sartori_. The rest of the _phlebodes_-stock was  restricted to the humid forests on the Caribbean lowlands of lower  Central America. The increased aridity on the Pacific lowlands  eliminated the _microcephala_-stock from southern Honduras and  northwestern Nicaragua and in so doing left an isolated population on  the lowlands of Chiapasand Guatemala, which differentiated into  _robertmertensi_. The original stock on the Pacific lowlands of Panama  and southeastern Costa Rica became _microcephala_.    If the _microcephala_-stock was, as we believe, better adapted for  existence under subhumid conditions than was the _phlebodes_-stock,  the development of subhumid conditions in much of the lowland region  of northern Central America and southern Mexico would have permitted  the expansion of the range of _microcephala_ into the area now  inhabited by _H. m. underwoodi_, while _phlebodes_ was being eliminated  from this area by climatic conditions that were unsuited to its  survival there. Perhaps the similarity in coloration of _H. m.  underwoodi_ and _phlebodes_ is the result of convergence or possibly  hybridization occurred at the time the former was expanding its range  and the latter's range was being restricted. If hybridization did  occur, the differences in mating call subsequently were enhanced,  thereby providing a valid isolating mechanism in sympatric populations.    _Hyla microcephala_ and _phlebodes_ range into northern South America.  Probably both species entered South America in relatively recent times  after they had differentiated from one another in Central America.          LITERATURE CITED      Boulenger, G. A.    1898.

The possibilities as  to size of the mascalonge and Northern pickerel no man knows. Frank  Forester thinks it probable that the former attains to the weight of  sixty to eighty pounds, while he only accords the pickerel a weight of  seventeen to eighteen pounds. I have seen several pickerel of over forty  pounds, and one that turned the scale at fifty-three. And I saw a  mascalonge on Georgian Bay that was longer than the Canuck guide who was  toting the fish over his shoulder by a stick thrust in the mouth and  gills. The snout reached to the top of the guide's head, while the  caudal fin dragged on the ground. There was no chance for weighing the  fish, but I hefted him several times, carefully, and am certain he  weighed more than a bushel of wheat. Just what tackle would be proper  for such a powerful fellow I am not prepared to say, having lost the  largest specimens I ever hooked. My best mascalonge weighed less than  twenty pounds. My largest pickerel still less.    I will close this discursive chapter by offering a bit of advice. Do not  go into the woods on a fishing tour without a stock of well cleansed  angle-worms. Keep them in a tin can partly filled with damp moss, and in  a cool moist place. There is no one variety of bait that the angler  finds so constantly useful as the worm. Izaak Walton by no means  despised worm or bait-fishing.          Chapter VI         CAMP COOKERY--HOW IT IS USUALLY DONE, WITH A FEW SIMPLE HINTS       ON PLAIN COOKING--COOKING FIRE AND OUT-DOOR RANGE      The way in which an average party of summer outers will contrive to  manage--or mis-manage--the camp and camp-fire so as to get the greatest  amount of smoke and discontent at the least outlay of time and force, is  something past all understanding, and somewhat aggravating to an old  woodsman who knows some better. But it is just as good fun as the  cynical O. W. can ask, to see a party of three or four enthusiastic  youngsters organize the camp on the first day in, and proceed to cook  the first meal. Of course, every man is boss, and every one is bound to  build the fire, which every one proceeds to do. There are no back logs,  no fore sticks, and no arrangement for level solid bases on which to  place frying-pans, coffee pots, etc. But, there is a sufficiency of  knots, dry sticks, bark and chunks, with some kindling at the bottom,  and a heavy volume of smoke working its way through the awkward-looking  pile. Presently thin tongues of blue flame begin to shoot up through the  interstices, and four brand new coffee pots are wriggled into level  positions at as many different points on the bonfire. Four hungry  youngsters commence slicing ham and pork, four frying-pans are brought  out from as many hinged and lidded soap boxes--when one man yells out  hurriedly, \"Look out, Joe, there's your coffee pot handle coming off.\"  And he drops his frying-pan to save his coffee pot, which he does, minus  the spout and handle. Then it is seen that the flames have increased  rapidly, and all the pots are in danger. A short, sharp skirmish rescues  them, at the expense of some burned fingers, and culinary operations are  the order of the hour.    Coffee and tea are brewed with the loss of a handle or two, and the  frying-pans succeed in scorching the pork and ham to an unwholesome  black mess. The potato kettle does better. It is not easy to spoil  potatoes by cooking them in plenty of boiling water; and, as there is  plenty of bread with fresh butter, not to mention canned goods, the  hungry party feed sufficiently, but not satisfactorily. Everything seems  pervaded with smoke. The meat is scorched bitter, and the tea is of the  sort described by Charles Dudley Warner, in his humorous description of  \"Camping Out\": \"The sort of tea that takes hold, lifts the hair, and  disposes the drinker to hilariousness. There is no deception about it,  it tastes of tannin, and spruce, and creosote.\" Of the cooking he says:  \"Everything has been cooked in a tin pail and a skillet--potatoes, tea,  pork, mutton, slapjacks. You wonder how everything would have been  prepared in so few utensils. When you eat, the wonder ceases, everything  might have been cooked in one pail. It is a noble meal.... The slapjacks  are a solid job of work, made to last, and not go to pieces in a  person's stomach like a trivial bun.\"    I have before me a copy of _Forest and Stream_, in which the canoe  editor, under the heading of \"The Galley Fire,\" has some remarks well  worth quoting. He says: \"The question of camp cookery is one of the  greatest importance to all readers of _Forest and Stream_, but most of  all to the canoeists. From ignorance of what to carry the canoeist falls  back on canned goods, never healthy as a steady diet, Brunswick soup and  eggs.... The misery of that first camp-fire, who has forgotten it?  Tired, hungry, perhaps cold and wet, the smoke everywhere, the coffee  pot melted down, the can of soup upset in the fire, the fiendish conduct  of frying-pan and kettle, the final surrender of the exhausted victim,  sliding off to sleep with a piece of hard-tack in one hand and a slice  of canned beef in the other, only to dream of mother's hot biscuits,  juicy steaks, etc., etc.\" It is very well put, and so true to the life.  And again: \"Frying, baking, making coffee, stews, plain biscuits, the  neat and speedy preparation of a healthy 'square meal' can be easily  learned.\" Aye, and should be learned by every man who goes to the woods  with or without a canoe.    [Sidenote: The First Day Out]    But I was describing a first day's camping out, the party being four  young men and one old woodsman, the latter going along in a double  character of invited guest and amateur guide. When the boys are through  with their late dinner, they hustle the greasy frying-pans and  demoralized tinware into a corner of the shanty, and get out their rods  for an evening's fishing. They do it hurriedly, almost feverishly, as  youngsters are apt to do at the start. The O. W. has taken no part in  the dinner, and has said nothing save in response to direct questions,  nor has he done anything to keep up his reputation as a woodsman, except  to see that the shelter roof is properly put up and fastened. Having  seen to this, he reverts to his favorite pastime, sitting on a log and  smoking navy plug. Long experience has taught him that it is best to let  the boys effervesce a little. They will slop over a trifle at first, but  twenty-four hours will settle them. When they are fairly out of hearing,  he takes the old knapsack from the clipped limb where it has been hung,  cuts a slice of ham, butters a slice of bread, spreads the live coals  and embers, makes a pot of strong green tea, broils the ham on a  three-pronged birch fork, and has a clean, well-cooked plain dinner.  Then he takes the sharp three-pound camp axe, and fells a dozen small  birch and ash trees, cutting them into proper lengths and leaving them  for the boys to tote into camp. Next, a bushy, heavy-topped hemlock is  felled, and the O. W. proceeds leisurely to pick a heap of fine hemlock  browse. A few handfuls suffice to stuff the muslin pillow bag, and the  rest is carefully spread on the port side of the shanty for a bed. The  pillow is placed at the head, and the old Mackinac blanket-bag is spread  neatly over all, as a token of ownership and possession. If the  youngsters want beds of fine, elastic browse, let 'em make their own  beds.    No camp-fire should be without poker and tongs. The poker is a beech  stick four feet long by two inches thick, flattened at one end, with a  notch cut in it for lifting kettles, etc. To make the tongs, take a  tough beech or hickory stick, one inch thick by two feet in length,  shave it down nearly one-half for a foot in the center, thrust this part  into hot embers until it bends freely, bring the ends together and  whittle them smoothly to a fit on the inside, cross-checking them also  to give them a grip; finish off by chamfering the ends neatly from the  outside. They will be found exceedingly handy in rescuing a bit of  tinware, a slice of steak or ham, or any small article that happens to  get dropped in a hot fire.    And don't neglect the camp broom. It is made by laying bushy hemlock  twigs around a light handle, winding them firmly with strong twine or  moose wood bark, and chopping off the ends of the twigs evenly. It can  be made in ten minutes. Use it to brush any leaves, sticks, and any  litter from about the camp or fire. Neatness is quite as pleasant and  wholesome around the forest camp as in the home kitchen. These little  details may seem trivial to the reader. But remember, if there is a spot  on earth where trifles make up the sum of human enjoyment, it is to be  found in a woodland camp. All of which the O. W. fully appreciates, as  he finishes the above little jobs; after which he proceeds to spread the  fire to a broad level bed of glowing embers, nearly covering the same  with small pieces of hemlock bark, that the boys may have a decent  cooking fire on their return.    About sundown they come straggling in, not jubilant and hilarious,  footsore rather and a little cross. The effervescence is subsiding, and  the noise is pretty well knocked out of them. They have caught and  dressed some three score of small brook trout, which they deposit beside  the shanty, and proceed at once to move on the fire, with evident intent  of raising a conflagration, but are checked by the O. W., who calls  their attention to the fact that for all culinary purposes, the fire is  about as near the right thing as they are likely to get it. Better defer  the bonfire until after supper. Listening to the voice of enlightened  woodcraft, they manage to fry trout and make tea without scorch or  creosote, and the supper is a decided improvement on the dinner. But the  dishes are piled away as before, without washing.    [Sidenote:"]]]
