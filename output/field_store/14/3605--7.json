In some factories the cutting is done by  machinery; in others the \"upper cutter\" lays the leather on a block  and cuts around the pattern with a small but very sharp knife. It  needs skill and judgment to be a cutter; for a careless workman can  easily waste the skins badly by not laying the patterns on to the best  advantage. While this work is going on, the linings, trimmings, soles,  and other parts are also being prepared, and all these many pieces now  meet in the \"stitching-room.\" At the first glance, it does not seem as  if the right ones could ever come together, even though they are  marked, and sometimes it does happen that a 4a vamp, for instance, is  put with 5a quarters, and nobody knows the difference until the  experienced eye of the foreman notices that something is wrong with  the shoe. The uppers of the shoe are now stitched up, and after a  careful inspection, they are sent on to the \"lasting-room.\" The \"last\"  of the earlier times was roughly whittled out, and it was the same for  both feet; but the last of to-day is almost a work of art, so  carefully is it made and polished. The shoe manufacturers jokingly  declare that lasts must be changed three times a day in order to keep  up with the fashions. Feet do not change in form, save when they have  been distorted by badly shaped shoes; but in spite of this, people  insist upon having their shoes long and narrow, or short and wide,  with high heels or with low heels, with broad toes or with pointed  toes, as the whim of the moment may be. It really is a big problem  for the shoe manufacturers to suit people's fancies and yet give them  some degree of comfort.    While the uppers are being stitched, the soles and inner soles and  counters have been made ready and brought to the lasting-room. The toe  stiffeners and also the counters are now cemented into their places.  The inner sole is tacked to the last, and the uppers are put in place  and held there by a tack at the heel. This is done by machines; but  their working is simple compared with that of the machine which now  takes charge of the half-made shoe. This machine puts out sturdy  little pincers which seize the edge of the uppers, pull it smoothly  and evenly into place, and drive a tack far enough in to keep it from  slipping. Now comes the welting. A welt is a narrow strip of leather  which is sewed to the lower edge of the upper all the way around the  shoe except at the heel. This brings the upper, the lip of the inner  sole, and the welt together. The inside of the shoe is now smooth and  even, but around the outside of the sole is the ridge made by the welt  and the sewing, and within the ridge a depression that must be filled  up. Tarred paper or cork in a sort of cement are used for this. The  shank is fastened into its place and the welt made smooth and even.  The outer sole is coated with rubber cement, put into position under  heavy pressure to shape it exactly like the sole of the last, and then  sewed to the welt. If it was not for the welt, the outer sole would  have to be sewed directly to the inner sole. The nailing and pegging  of the old-fashioned shoemaker are also reproduced by the modern  machine.    The shoe is still open at the heel; but now the heel parts of both  sole and uppers are fastened together; the edges have been nicely  trimmed, and next the heels are nailed to the shoe by another machine  which does the work at a blow, leaving the nails standing out a little  below the lowest lift. Another lift is forced upon these; and that  is why the heel of a new shoe shows no signs of nails. The heel is  trimmed, and then come the final sandpapering and blackening. The  bottom of a new shoe has a peculiar soft, velvety appearance and  feeling; and this is produced by rubbing it with fine emery paper  fastened upon a little rubber pad. A stamping-machine marks the sole  with the name of the manufacturer. Last of all, the shoe is put upon  a treeing machine, where an iron foot stretches it into precisely  the shape of the wooden last on which it was made.    This is the method by which large numbers of shoes are made, but  there are many details which differ. Laced shoes must have tongues  as well as eyelets, while buttoned shoes must have buttons and  buttonholes. \"Turned\" shoes have no inner sole, but uppers and  outer sole are sewed together wrong side out and then turned. In  shoemaking, as in all other business, if a manufacturer is to  succeed, he must see that there is no waste. He has of course no  use for a careless cutter, who would perhaps waste large pieces of  leather; but even the tiniest scraps are of value for some purpose.  They can be treated with chemicals, softened by boiling, and pressed  into boards or other articles or made into floor coverings. At any  rate, they must be used for something. No business is small enough  or large enough to endure waste.          X    IN THE COTTON MILL      If you ravel a bit of cotton cloth, you will find that it is made up  of tiny threads, some going up and down, and others going from right  to left. These threads are remarkably strong for their size. Look at  one under a magnifying glass, in a brilliant light, and you will see  that the little fibers of which it is made shine almost like glass.  Examine it more closely, and you will see that it is twisted. Break  it, and you will find that it does not break off sharp, but rather  pulls apart, leaving many fibers standing out from both ends.    Cotton comes to the factory tightly pressed in bales, and the work of  the manufacturer is to make it into these little threads. The bales  are big, weighing four or five hundred pounds apiece. They are  generally somewhat ragged, for they are done up in coarse, heavy jute.  The first glance at an opened cotton bale is a little discouraging,  for it is not perfectly clean by any means. Bits of leaves and stems  are mixed in with the cotton, and even some of the smaller seeds which  have slipped through the gin. There is dust, and plenty of it, that  the coarse burlap has not kept out. The first thing to do is to loosen  the cotton and make it clean. Great armfuls are thrown into a machine  called a \"bale-breaker.\" Rollers with spikes, blunt so as not to  injure the fiber, catch it up and tear the lumps to pieces, and  \"beaters\" toss it into a light, foamy mass. Something else happens to  the cotton while it is in the machine, for a current of air is passing  through it all the while, and this blows out the dust and bits of  rubbish. This current is controlled like the draft of a stove, and it  is allowed to be just strong enough to draw the cotton away from the  beater when it has become light and open, leaving the harder masses  for more beating. When it comes out of the opener, it is in sheets or  \"laps\" three or four feet wide and only half an inch thick. They are  white and fleecy and almost cloudlike; and so thin that any sand or  broken leaves still remaining will drop out of their own weight.    In this work the manufacturer has been aiming, not only at cleaning  the cotton and making it fluffy, but also at mixing it. There are many  sorts of cotton, some of longer or finer or more curly or stronger  fiber than others, some white and some tinged with color; but the  cloth woven of cotton must be uniform; therefore all these kinds must  be thoroughly mixed. Even the tossing and turning and beating that  it has already received is not enough, and it has to go into a  \"scutcher,\" three or four laps at a time, one on top of another, to  have still more beating and dusting. When it comes out, it is in a  long roll or sheet, so even that any yard of it will weigh very nearly  the same as any other yard. The fibers, however, are lying \"every  which way,\" and before they can be drawn out into thread, they must be  made to lie parallel. This is brought about in part by carding. When  people used to spin and weave in their own houses, they used \"hand  cards.\" These were somewhat like brushes for the hair, but instead of  bristles they had wires shaped much as if wire hairpins had been bent  twice and put through leather in such a way as to form hooks on one  side of it. This leather was then nailed to a wooden back and a handle  added. The carder took one card in each hand, and with the hooks  pointing opposite ways brushed the cotton between them, thus making  the fibers lie parallel. This is just what is done in a mill, only by  machinery, of course. Instead of the little hand cards, there are  great cylinders covered with what is called \"card clothing\"; that is,  canvas bristling with the bent wires, six or seven hundred to the  square inch. This takes the place of one card. The place of the other  is filled by what are called \"flats,\" or narrow bars of iron covered  with card clothing. The cylinders move rapidly, the flats slowly, and  the cotton passes between them. It comes out in a dainty white film  not so very much heavier than a spider's web, and so beautifully white  and shining that it does not seem as if the big, oily, noisy machines  could ever have produced it. In a moment, however, it is gone  somewhere into the depths of the machine. We have seen the last of the  fleecy sheet, for the machinery narrows it and rounds it, and when it  comes into sight again, it looks like a soft round cord about an inch  thick, and is coiled up in cans nearly a yard high. This cord is  called \"sliver.\"    [Illustration: IN A COTTON MILL    The \"sliver\" coming through the machine, and the \"roving\" being  twisted and wound on bobbins.]    The sliver is not uniform; even now its fibers are not entirely  parallel, and it is as weak as wet tissue paper. It now pays a visit  to the \"drawing-frame.\" Four or six slivers are put together and run  through this frame. They go between four pairs of rollers, the first  pair moving slowly, the others more rapidly. The slow pair hold the  slivers back, while the fast"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28570"],[0,"Astronomy of To-day: A Popular Introduction in Non-Technical Language (#11)"],[1,"a little, so to  speak; and each time the eclipse comes round it is found to be shifted a  little farther. Every solar eclipse has therefore a definite \"life\" of  its own upon the earth, lasting about 1150 years, or 64 saros returns,  and working its way little by little across our globe from north to  south, or from south to north, as the case may be. Let us take an  imaginary example. A _partial_ eclipse occurs, say, somewhere near the  North Pole, the edge of the \"partial\" shadow just grazing the earth, and  the \"track of totality\" being as yet cast into space. Here we have the  beginning of a series. At each saros recurrence the partial shadow  encroaches upon a greater extent of earth-surface. At length, in its  turn, the track of totality begins to impinge upon the earth. This track  streaks across our globe at each return of the eclipse, repeating itself  every time in a slightly more southerly latitude. South and south it  moves, passing in turn the Tropic of Cancer, the Equator, the Tropic of  Capricorn, until it reaches the South Pole; after which it touches the  earth no longer, but is cast into space. The rear portion of the partial  shadow, in its turn, grows less and less in extent; and it too in time  finally passes off. Our imaginary eclipse series is now no more--its  \"life\" has ended.    We have taken, as an example, an eclipse series moving from north to  south. We might have taken one moving from south to north, for they  progress in either direction.    From the description just given the reader might suppose that, if the  tracks of totality of an eclipse series were plotted upon a chart of the  world, they would lie one beneath another like a set of steps. This is,  however, _not_ the case, and the reason is easily found. It depends upon  the fact that the saros does not comprise an exact number of days, but  includes, as we have seen, one-third of a day in addition.    It will be granted, of course, that if the number of days was exact, the  _same_ parts of the earth would always be brought round by the axial  rotation _to front the sun_ at the moment of the recurrence of the  eclipse. But as there is still one-third of a day to complete the saros  period, the earth has yet to make one-third of a rotation upon its axis  before the eclipse takes place. Thus at every recurrence the track of  totality finds itself placed one-third of the earth's circumference to  the _westward_. Three of the recurrences will, of course, complete the  circuit of the globe; and so the fourth recurrence will duplicate the  one which preceded it, three saros returns, or 54 years and 1 month  before. This duplication, as we have already seen, will, however, be  situated in a latitude to the south or north of its predecessor,  according as the eclipse series is progressing in a southerly or  northerly direction.    Lastly, every eclipse series, after working its way across the earth,  will return again to go through the same process after some 12,000  years; so that, at the end of that great lapse of time, the entire  \"life\" of every eclipse should repeat itself, provided that the  conditions of the solar system have not altered appreciably during the  interval.    We are now in a position to consider this gradual southerly or  northerly progress of eclipse recurrences in its application to the case  of eclipses of the moon. It should be evident that, just as in solar  eclipses the lunar shadow is lowered or raised (as the case may be) each  time it strikes the terrestrial surface, so in lunar eclipses will the  body of the moon shift its place at each recurrence relatively to the  position of the earth's shadow. Every lunar eclipse, therefore, will  commence on our satellite's disc as a partial eclipse at the northern or  southern extremity, as the case may be. Let us take, as an example, an  imaginary series of eclipses of the moon progressing from north to  south. At each recurrence the partial phase will grow greater, its  boundary encroaching more and more to the southward, until eventually  the whole disc is enveloped by the shadow, and the eclipse becomes  total. It will then repeat itself as total during a number of  recurrences, until the entire breadth of the shadow has been passed  through, and the northern edge of the moon at length springs out into  sunlight. This illuminated portion will grow more and more extensive at  each succeeding return, the edge of the shadow appearing to recede from  it until it finally passes off at the south. Similarly, when a lunar  eclipse commences as partial at the south of the moon, the edge of the  shadow at each subsequent recurrence finds itself more and more to the  northward. In due course the total phase will supervene, and will  persist during a number of recurrences until the southerly trend of the  moon results in the uncovering of the lunar surface at the south. Thus,  as the boundary of the shadow is left more and more to the northward,  the illuminated portion on the southern side of the moon becomes at each  recurrence greater and the darkened portion on the northern side less,  until the shadow eventually passes off at the north.    The \"life\" of an eclipse of the moon happens, for certain reasons, to be  much shorter than that of an eclipse of the sun. It lasts during only  about 860 years, or 48 saros returns.    Fig. 6, p. 81, is a map of the world on Mercator's Projection, showing a  portion of the march of the total solar eclipse of August 30, 1905,  across the surface of the earth. The projection in question has been  employed because it is the one with which people are most familiar. This  eclipse began by striking the neighbourhood of the North Pole in the  guise of a partial eclipse during the latter part of the reign of Queen  Elizabeth, and became total on the earth for the first time on the 24th  of June 1797. Its next appearance was on the 6th of July 1815. It has  not been possible to show the tracks of totality of these two early  visitations on account of the distortion of the polar regions consequent  on the _fiction_ of Mercator's Projection. It is therefore made to  commence with the track of its third appearance, viz. on July 17, 1833.  In consequence of those variations in the apparent sizes of the sun and  moon, which result, as we have seen, from the variations in their  distances from the earth, this eclipse will change from a total into an  annular eclipse towards the end of the twenty-first century. By that  time the track will have passed to the southern side of the equator. The  track will eventually leave the earth near the South Pole about the  beginning of the twenty-sixth century, and the rear portion of the  partial shadow will in its turn be clear of the terrestrial surface by  about 2700 A.D., when the series comes to an end.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Map of the World on Mercator's Projection,  showing a portion of the progress of the Total Solar Eclipse of August  30, 1905, across the surface of the earth.]      [4] Astronomical Essays (p. 40), London, 1907.    [5] In some cases the periods between the dates of the corresponding  eclipses _appear_ to include a greater number of days than ten; but this  is easily explained when allowance is made for intervening _leap_ years  (in each of which an _extra_ day has of course been added), and also for  variations in local time.          CHAPTER VIII    FAMOUS ECLIPSES OF THE SUN      What is thought to be the earliest reference to an eclipse comes down to  us from the ancient Chinese records, and is over four thousand years  old. The eclipse in question was a solar one, and occurred, so far as  can be ascertained, during the twenty-second century B.C. The story runs  that the two state astronomers, Ho and Hi by name, being exceedingly  intoxicated, were unable to perform their required duties, which  consisted in superintending the customary rites of beating drums,  shooting arrows, and the like, in order to frighten away the mighty  dragon which it was believed was about to swallow up the Lord of Day.  This eclipse seems to have been only partial; nevertheless a great  turmoil ensued, and the two astronomers were put to death, no doubt with  the usual _celestial_ cruelty.    The next eclipse mentioned in the Chinese annals is also a solar  eclipse, and appears to have taken place more than a thousand years  later, namely in 776 B.C. Records of similar eclipses follow from the  same source; but as they are mere notes of the events, and do not enter  into any detail, they are of little interest. Curiously enough the  Chinese have taken practically no notice of eclipses of the moon, but  have left us a comparatively careful record of comets, which has been  of value to modern astronomy.    The earliest mention of a _total_ eclipse of the sun (for it should be  noted that the ancient Chinese eclipse above-mentioned was merely  partial) was deciphered in 1905, on a very ancient Babylonian tablet, by  Mr. L.W. King of the British Museum. This eclipse took place in the year  1063 B.C.    Assyrian tablets record three solar eclipses which occurred between  three and four hundred years later than this. The first of these was in  763 B.C.; the total phase being visible near Nineveh.    The next record of an eclipse of the sun comes to us from a Grecian  source. This eclipse took place in 585 B.C., and has been the subject of  much investigation. Herodotus, to whom we are indebted for the account,  tells us that it occurred during a battle in a war which had been waging  for some years between the Lydians and Medes. The sudden coming on of  darkness led to a termination of the contest, and peace was afterwards  made between the combatants. The historian goes on to state that the  eclipse had been foretold by Thales, who is looked upon as the Founder  of Grecian astronomy. This eclipse is in consequence known as the  \"Eclipse of Thales.\" It would seem as if that philosopher were "]]]
