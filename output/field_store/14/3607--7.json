Solve one and we solve both--then  we learn how to combat it. But how to remove it--that is the problem.  You and I can never lift this out of here.\"    His glance darted about. There was a small door in the metal beam. The  groove in which the shells were placed led to it; it was a port for  launching the projectiles. He moved it, opened it. A dash of spray  struck him in the face. He glanced inquiringly at his companion.    \"Dare we do it?\" he asked. \"Slide one of them out?\"    Each man looked long into the eyes of the other. Was this, then, the end  of their terrible night? One shell to be dropped--then a bursting  volcano to blast them to eternity....    \"The boys in the planes risked it,\" said Thurston quietly. \"They got  theirs.\" He stopped for a broken fragment of steel. \"Try one with a fan  on; it hasn't a detonator.\"    The men pried at the slim thing. It slid slowly toward the open port.  One heave and it balanced on the edge, then vanished abruptly. The spray  was cold on their faces. They breathed heavily with the realization that  they still lived.           *       *       *       *       *    There were days of horror that followed, horror tempered by a numbing  paralysis of all emotions. There were bodies by thousands to be heaped  in the pit where San Diego had stood, to be buried beneath countless  tons of debris and dirt. Trains brought an army of helpers; airplanes  came with doctors and nurses and the beginning of a mountain of  supplies. The need was there; it must be met. Yet the whole world was  waiting while it helped, waiting for the next blow to fall.    Telegraph service was improvised, and radio receivers rushed in. The  news of the world was theirs once more. And it told of a terrified,  waiting world. There would be no temporizing now on the part of the  invaders. They had seen the airplanes swarming from the ground--they  would know an airdrome next time from the air. Thurston had noted the  windows in the great shell, windows of dull-colored glass which would  protect the darkness of the interior, essential to life for the horrible  occupant, but through which it could see. It could watch all directions  at once.           *       *       *       *       *    The great shell had vanished from the shore. Pounding waves and the  shifting sands of high tide had obliterated all trace. More than once  had Thurston uttered devout thanks for the chance shell from an  anti-aircraft gun that had entered the funnel beneath the machine, had  bent and twisted the arrangement of mirrors that he and MacGregor had  seen, and, exploding, had cracked and broken the domed roof of the  bulb. They had learned little, but MacGregor was up north within reach  of Los Angeles laboratories. And he had with him the slim cylinder of  death. He was studying, thinking.    Telephone service had been established for official business. The whole  nation-wide system, for that matter, was under military control. The  Secretary of War had flown back to Washington. The whole world was on a  war basis. War! And none knew where they should defend themselves, nor  how.    An orderly rushed Thurston to the telephone. \"You are wanted at once;  Los Angeles calling.\"    The voice of MacGregor was cool and unhurried as Thurston listened.  \"Grab a plane, old man,\" he was saying, \"and come up here on the jump.\"    The phrase brought a grim smile to Thurston's tired lips. \"Hell's  popping!\" the Secretary of War had added on that evening those long ages  before. Did MacGregor have something? Was a different kind of hell  preparing to pop? The thoughts flashed through the listener's mind.    \"I need a good deputy,\" MacGregor said. \"You may be the whole works--may  have to carry on--but I'll tell you it all later. Meet me at the  Biltmore.\"    \"In less than two hours,\" Thurston assured him.           *       *       *       *       *    A plane was at his disposal. Riley's legs were functioning again, after  a fashion. They kept the appointment with minutes to spare.    \"Come on,\" said MacGregor, \"I'll talk to you in the car.\" The automobile  whirled them out of the city to race off upon a winding highway that  climbed into far hills. There was twenty miles of this; MacGregor had  time for his talk.    \"They've struck,\" he told the two men. \"They were over Germany  yesterday. The news was kept quiet: I got the last report a half-hour  ago. They pretty well wiped out Berlin. No air-force there. France and  England sent a swarm of planes, from the reports. Poor devils! No need  to tell you what they got. We've seen it first hand. They headed west  over the Atlantic, the four machines. Gave England a burst or two from  high up, paused over New York, then went on. But they're here somewhere,  we think. Now listen:    \"How long was it from the time when you saw the first monster until we  heard from them again?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Thurston forced his mind back to those days that seemed so far in the  past. He tried to remember.    \"Four days,\" broke in Riley. \"It was the fourth day after we found the  devil feeding.\"    \"Feeding!\" interrupted the scientist. \"That's the point I am making.  Four days. Remember that!    \"And we knew they were down in the Argentine five days ago--that's  another item kept from an hysterical public. They slaughtered some  thousands of cattle; there were scores of them found where the  devils--I'll borrow Riley's word--where the devils had fed. Nothing left  but hide and bones.    \"And--mark this--that was four days before they appeared over Berlin.    \"Why? Don't ask me. Do they have to lie quiet for that period miles up  there in space? God knows. Perhaps! These things seem outside the  knowledge of a deity. But enough of that! Remember: four days! Let us  assume that there is this four days waiting period. It will help us to  time them. I'll come back to that later.    \"Here is what I have been doing. We know that light is a means of  attack. I believe that the detonators we saw on those bombs merely  opened a seal in the shell and forced in a flash of some sort. I believe  that radiant energy is what fires the blast.    \"What is it that explodes? Nobody knows. We have opened the shell,  working in the absolute blackness of a room a hundred feet underground.  We found in it a powder--two powders, to be exact.    \"They are mixed. One is finely divided, the other rather granular. Their  specific gravity is enormous, beyond anything known to physical science  unless it would be the hypothetical neutron masses we think are in  certain stars. But this is not matter as we know matter; it is something  new.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Our theory is this: the hydrogen atom has been split, resolved into  components, not of electrons and the proton centers, but held at some  halfway point of decomposition. Matter composed only of neutrons would  be heavy beyond belief. This fits the theory in that respect. But the  point is this: When these solids are formed--they are dense--they  represent in a cubic centimeter possibly a cubic mile of hydrogen gas  under normal pressure. That's a guess, but it will give you the idea.    \"Not compressed, you understand, but all the elements present in other  than elemental form for the reconstruction of the atom ... for a million  billions of atoms.    \"Then the light strikes it. These dense solids become instantly a  gas--miles of it held in that small space.    \"There you have it: the gas, the explosion, the entire absence of  heat--which is to say, its terrific cold--when it expands.\"    Slim Riley was looking bewildered but game. \"Sure, I saw it snow,\" he  affirmed, \"so I guess the rest must be O.K. But what are we going to do  about it? You say light kills 'em, and fires their bombs. But how can we  let light into those big steel shells, or the little ones either?\"    \"Not through those thick walls,\" said MacGregor. \"Not light. One of our  anti-aircraft shells made a direct hit. That might not happen again in a  million shots. But there are other forms of radiant energy that do  penetrate steel....\"           *       *       *       *       *    The car had stopped beside a grove of eucalyptus. A barren, sun-baked  hillside stretched beyond. MacGregor motioned them to alight.    Riley was afire with optimism. \"And do you believe it?\" he asked  eagerly. \"Do you believe that we've got 'em licked?\"    Thurston, too, looked into MacGregor's face: Riley was not the only one  who needed encouragement. But the gray eyes were suddenly tired and  hopeless.    \"You ask what I believe,\" said the scientist slowly. \"I believe we are  witnessing the end of the world, our world of humans, their struggles,  their grave hopes and happiness and aspirations....\"    He was not looking at them. His gaze was far off in space.    \"Men will struggle and fight with their puny weapons, but these monsters  will win, and they will have their way with us. Then more of them will  come. The world, I believe, is doomed....\"    He straightened his shoulders. \"But we can die fighting,\" he added, and  pointed over the hill.    \"Over there,\" he said, \"in the valley beyond, is a charge of their  explosive and a little apparatus of mine. I intend to fire the charge  from a distance of three hundred yards. I expect to be safe, perfectly  safe. But accidents happen.    \"In Washington a plane is being prepared. I have given instructions  through hours of phoning. They are working night and day. It will  contain a huge generator for producing my ray. Nothing new! Just the  product of our knowledge of radiant energy up to date. But the man who  flies that plane will die--horribly. No time to experiment with  protection. The rays will destroy him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#11)"],[1,"his hands, and  once more stooping in the fireplace, gave a leap, and up the chimney he  went with a rattle of loose mortar and a black trickle of soot.    By and by footsteps sounded outside the door. There was a pause; a  hurried whispering of women's voices; the twitter of a nervous laugh,  and then the door was pushed softly opens and the girl to whom the  one-eyed Hans had given the necklace of blue and white beads with the  filigree cross hanging from it, peeped uncertainly into the room. Behind  her broad, heavy face were three others, equally homely and stolid; for  a while all four stood there, looking blankly into the room and around  it. Nothing was there but the peddler's knapsack lying in the middle of  the floor-the man was gone. The light of expectancy slowly faded Out of  the girl's face, and in its place succeeded first bewilderment and then  dull alarm. \"But, dear heaven,\" she said, \"where then has the peddler  man gone?\"    A moment or two of silence followed her speech. \"Perhaps,\" said one of  the others, in a voice hushed with awe, \"perhaps it was the evil one  himself to whom thou didst open the door.\"    Again there was a hushed and breathless pause; it was the lass who had  let Hans in at the postern, who next spoke.    \"Yes,\" said she, in a voice trembling with fright at what she had done,  \"yes, it must have been the evil one, for now I remember he had but one  eye.\" The four girls crossed themselves, and their eyes grew big and  round with the fright.    Suddenly a shower of mortar came rattling down the chimney. \"Ach!\" cried  the four, as with one voice. Bang! the door was clapped to and away they  scurried like a flock of frightened rabbits.    When Jacob, the watchman, came that way an hour later, upon his evening  round of the castle, he found a peddler's knapsack lying in the middle  of the floor. He turned it over with his pike-staff and saw that it was  full of beads and trinkets and ribbons.    \"How came this here?\" said he. And then, without waiting for the answer  which he did not expect, he flung it over his shoulder and marched away  with it.          X. How Hans Brought Terror to the Kitchen.    Hans found himself in a pretty pickle in the chimney, for the soot got  into his one eye and set it to watering, and into his nose and set him  to sneezing, and into his mouth and his ears and his hair. But still  he struggled on, up and up; \"for every chimney has a top,\" said Hans  to himself \"and I am sure to climb out somewhere or other.\" Suddenly he  came to a place where another chimney joined the one he was climbing,  and here he stopped to consider the matter at his leisure. \"See now,\" he  muttered, \"if I still go upward I may come out at the top of some tall  chimney-stack with no way of getting down outside. Now, below here  there must be a fire-place somewhere, for a chimney does not start from  nothing at all; yes, good! we will go down a while and see what we make  of that.\"    It was a crooked, zigzag road that he had to travel, and rough and hard  into the bargain. His one eye tingled and smarted, and his knees and  elbows were rubbed to the quick; nevertheless One-eyed Hans had been in  worse trouble than this in his life.    Down he went and down he went, further than he had climbed upward  before. \"Sure, I must be near some place or other,\" he thought.    As though in instant answer to his thoughts, he heard the sudden sound  of a voice so close beneath him that he stopped short in his downward  climbing and stood as still as a mouse, with his heart in his mouth.  A few inches more and he would have been discovered;--what would have  happened then would have been no hard matter to foretell.    Hans braced his back against one side of the chimney, his feet against  the other and then, leaning forward, looked down between his knees. The  gray light of the coming evening glimmered in a wide stone fireplace  just below him. Within the fireplace two people were moving about upon  the broad hearth, a great, fat woman and a shock-headed boy. The woman  held a spit with two newly trussed fowls upon it, so that One-eyed Hans  knew that she must be the cook.    \"Thou ugly toad,\" said the woman to the boy, \"did I not bid thee make a  fire an hour ago? and now, here there is not so much as a spark to roast  the fowls withall, and they to be basted for the lord Baron's supper.  Where hast thou been for all this time?\"    \"No matter,\" said the boy, sullenly, as he laid the fagots ready for the  lighting; \"no matter, I was not running after Long Jacob, the bowman, to  try to catch him for a sweetheart, as thou hast been doing.\"    The reply was instant and ready. The cook raised her hand; \"smack!\" she  struck and a roar from the scullion followed.    \"Yes, good,\" thought Hans, as he looked down upon them; \"I am glad that  the boy's ear was not on my head.\"    \"Now give me no more of thy talk,\" said the woman, \"but do the work  that thou hast been bidden.\" Then--\"How came all this black soot here, I  should like to know?\"    \"How should I know?\" snuffled the scullion, \"mayhap thou wouldst blame  that on me also?\"    \"That is my doing,\" whispered Hans to himself; \"but if they light the  fire, what then becomes of me?\"    \"See now,\" said the cook; \"I go to make the cakes ready; if I come back  and find that thou hast not built the fire, I will warm thy other ear  for thee.\"    \"So,\" thought Hans; \"then will be my time to come down the chimney, for  there will be but one of them.\"    The next moment he heard the door close and knew that the cook had gone  to make the cakes ready as she said. And as he looked down he saw that  the boy was bending over the bundle of fagots, blowing the spark that  he had brought in upon the punk into a flame. The dry fagots began to  crackle and blaze. \"Now is my time,\" said Hans to himself. Bracing his  elbows against each side of the chimney, he straightened his legs so  that he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that  fell rattling upon the fagots that were now beginning to blaze brightly,  whereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold  upon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet in the midst  of the burning fagots. The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor,  where he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as  dough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful  inky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then  his scattered wits came back to him. \"It is the evil one,\" he roared.  And thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to  the door. Then out he leaped and, banging it to behind him, flew down  the passageway, yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind  him.    All the time One-eyed Hans was brushing away the sparks that clung to  his clothes. He was as black as ink from head to foot with the soot from  the chimney.    \"So far all is good,\" he muttered to himself, \"but if I go wandering  about in my sooty shoes I will leave black tracks to follow me, so there  is nothing to do but e'en to go barefoot.\"    He stooped and drawing the pointed soft leather shoes from his feet, he  threw them upon the now blazing fagots, where they writhed and twisted  and wrinkled, and at last burst into a flame. Meanwhile Hans lost no  time; he must find a hiding-place, and quickly, if he would yet hope  to escape. A great bread trough stood in the corner of the kitchen--a  hopper-shaped chest with a flat lid. It was the best hiding place that  the room afforded. Without further thought Hans ran to it, snatching up  from the table as he passed a loaf of black bread and a bottle half full  of stale wine, for he had had nothing to eat since that morning. Into  the great bread trough he climbed, and drawing the lid down upon him,  curled himself up as snugly as a mouse in its nest.    For a while the kitchen lay in silence, but at last the sound of voices  was heard at the door, whispering together in low tones. Suddenly the  door was flung open and a tall, lean, lantern-jawed fellow, clad in  rough frieze, strode into the room and stood there glaring with half  frightened boldness around about him; three or four women and the  trembling scullion crowded together in a frightened group behind him.    The man was Long Jacob, the bowman; but, after all, his boldness was  all wasted, for not a thread or a hair was to be seen, but only the  crackling fire throwing its cheerful ruddy glow upon the wall of the  room, now rapidly darkening in the falling gray of the twilight without.    The fat cook's fright began rapidly to turn into anger.    \"Thou imp,\" she cried, \"it is one of thy tricks,\" and she made a dive  for the scullion, who ducked around the skirts of one of the other women  and so escaped for the time; but Long Jacob wrinkled up his nose and  sniffed. \"Nay,\" said he, \"me thinks that there lieth some truth in the  tale that the boy hath told, for here is a vile smell of burned horn  that the black one bath left behind him.\"    It was the smell from the soft leather shoes that Hans had burned.    The silence of night had fallen over the Castle of Trutz-Drachen; not  a sound was heard but the squeaking of mice scurring behind the  wainscoting, the dull dripping of moisture from the eaves, or the  sighing of the night wind around the gables and through the naked  windows of the castle.    The lid of the great dough trough was softly raised, and a face, black  with soot, peeped cautiously out from under it. Then little by little  arose a figure as black as the face; and One-eyed Hans stepped out upon  the floor, stretching and rubbing himself.    \"Methinks I must have slept,\" he muttered. \"Hui, I am as stiff as a new  leather doublet, and now, what next is to become of me? I hope my luck  may yet stick to me, in spite of this foul black soot!\"    Along the middle of the front of the great hall of the"]]]
