It was difficult to see how they could  be re-opened. In view of the arming of the burghers, the small garrison  of Natal had been taking up positions to cover the frontier. The  Transvaal asked for an explanation of their presence. Sir Alfred Milner  answered that they were guarding British interests, and preparing  against contingencies. The roar of the fall was sounding loud and near.    On September 8th there was held a Cabinet Council--one of the most  important in recent years. A message was sent to Pretoria, which even  the opponents of the Government have acknowledged to be temperate, and  offering the basis for a peaceful settlement. It begins by repudiating  emphatically the claim of the Transvaal to be a sovereign international  State in the same sense in which the Orange Free State is one. Any  proposal made conditional upon such an acknowledgment could not be  entertained.    The British Government, however, was prepared to accept the five years'  'franchise' as stated in the note of August 19th, assuming at the same  time that in the Raad each member might talk his own language.    'Acceptance of these terms by the South African Republic would at once  remove tension between the two Governments, and would in all probability  render unnecessary any future intervention to secure redress for  grievances which the Uitlanders themselves would be able to bring to the  notice of the Executive Council and the Volksraad.    'Her Majesty's Government are increasingly impressed with the danger of  further delay in relieving the strain which has already caused so much  injury to the interests of South Africa, and they earnestly press for an  immediate and definite reply to the present proposal. If it is acceded  to they will be ready to make immediate arrangements...to settle all  details of the proposed tribunal of arbitration...If, however, as they  most anxiously hope will not be the case, the reply of the South African  Republic should be negative or inconclusive, I am to state that her  Majesty's Government must reserve to themselves the right to reconsider  the situation de novo, and to formulate their own proposals for a final  settlement.'    Such was the message, and Great Britain waited with strained attention  for the answer. But again there was a delay, while the rain came and the  grass grew, and the veld was as a mounted rifleman would have it. The  burghers were in no humour for concessions. They knew their own power,  and they concluded with justice that they were for the time far the  strongest military power in South Africa. 'We have beaten England  before, but it is nothing to the licking we shall give her now,' cried  a prominent citizen, and he spoke for his country as he said it. So  the empire waited and debated, but the sounds of the bugle were already  breaking through the wrangles of the politicians, and calling the nation  to be tested once more by that hammer of war and adversity by which  Providence still fashions us to some nobler and higher end.        CHAPTER 4. THE EVE OF WAR.    The message sent from the Cabinet Council of September 8th was evidently  the precursor either of peace or of war. The cloud must burst or blow  over. As the nation waited in hushed expectancy for a reply it spent  some portion of its time in examining and speculating upon those  military preparations which might be needed. The War Office had for  some months been arranging for every contingency, and had made certain  dispositions which appeared to them to be adequate, but which our future  experience was to demonstrate to be far too small for the very serious  matter in hand.    It is curious in turning over the files of such a paper as the 'Times'  to observe how at first one or two small paragraphs of military  significance might appear in the endless columns of diplomatic and  political reports, how gradually they grew and grew, until at last the  eclipse was complete, and the diplomacy had been thrust into the tiny  paragraphs while the war filled the journal. Under July 7th comes the  first glint of arms amid the drab monotony of the state papers. On  that date it was announced that two companies of Royal Engineers and  departmental corps with reserves of supplies and ammunition were being  dispatched. Two companies of engineers! Who could have foreseen that  they were the vanguard of the greatest army which ever at any time of  the world's history has crossed an ocean, and far the greatest which a  British general has commanded in the field?    On August 15th, at a time when the negotiations had already assumed a  very serious phase, after the failure of the Bloemfontein conference and  the dispatch of Sir Alfred Milner, the British forces in South Africa  were absolutely and absurdly inadequate for the purpose of the defence  of our own frontier. Surely such a fact must open the eyes of those who,  in spite of all the evidence, persist that the war was forced on by the  British. A statesman who forces on a war usually prepares for a war, and  this is exactly what Mr. Kruger did and the British authorities did not.  The overbearing suzerain power had at that date, scattered over a huge  frontier, two cavalry regiments, three field batteries, and six and a  half infantry battalions--say six thousand men. The innocent pastoral  States could put in the field forty or fifty thousand mounted riflemen,  whose mobility doubled their numbers, and a most excellent artillery,  including the heaviest guns which have ever been seen upon a  battlefield. At this time it is most certain that the Boers could have  made their way easily either to Durban or to Cape Town. The British  force, condemned to act upon the defensive, could have been masked and  afterwards destroyed, while the main body of the invaders would have  encountered nothing but an irregular local resistance, which would have  been neutralised by the apathy or hostility of the Dutch colonists. It  is extraordinary that our authorities seem never to have contemplated  the possibility of the Boers taking the initiative, or to have  understood that in that case our belated reinforcements would certainly  have had to land under the fire of the republican guns.    In July Natal had taken alarm, and a strong representation had been  sent from the prime minister of the colony to the Governor, Sir W. Hely  Hutchinson, and so to the Colonial Office. It was notorious that the  Transvaal was armed to the teeth, that the Orange Free State was  likely to join her, and that there had been strong attempts made, both  privately and through the press, to alienate the loyalty of the Dutch  citizens of both the British colonies. Many sinister signs were observed  by those upon the spot. The veld had been burned unusually early to  ensure a speedy grass-crop after the first rains, there had been a  collecting of horses, a distribution of rifles and ammunition. The Free  State farmers, who graze their sheep and cattle upon Natal soil during  the winter, had driven them off to places of safety behind the line  of the Drakensberg. Everything pointed to approaching war, and Natal  refused to be satisfied even by the dispatch of another regiment. On  September 6th a second message was received at the Colonial Office,  which states the case with great clearness and precision.    'The Prime Minister desires me to urge upon you by the unanimous advice  of the Ministers that sufficient troops should be dispatched to Natal  immediately to enable the colony to be placed in a state of defence  against an attack from the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I am  informed by the General Officer Commanding, Natal, that he will not have  enough troops, even when the Manchester Regiment arrives, to do more  than occupy Newcastle and at the same time protect the colony south of  it from raids, while Laing's Nek, Ingogo River and Zululand must be left  undefended. My Ministers know that every preparation has been made, both  in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, which would enable an attack  to be made on Natal at short notice. My Ministers believe that the Boers  have made up their minds that war will take place almost certainly, and  their best chance will be, when it seems unavoidable, to deliver a blow  before reinforcements have time to arrive. Information has been received  that raids in force will be made by way of Middle Drift and Greytown and  by way of Bond's Drift and Stangar, with a view to striking the railway  between Pietermaritzburg and Durban and cutting off communications of  troops and supplies. Nearly all the Orange Free State farmers in the  Klip River division, who stay in the colony usually till October at  least, have trekked, at great loss to themselves; their sheep are  lambing on the road, and the lambs die or are destroyed. Two at least of  the Entonjanani district farmers have trekked with all their belongings  into the Transvaal, in the first case attempting to take as hostages the  children of the natives on the farm. Reliable reports have been received  of attempts to tamper with loyal natives, and to set tribe against tribe  in order to create confusion and detail the defensive forces of the  colony. Both food and warlike stores in large quantities have been  accumulated at Volksrust, Vryheid and Standerton. Persons who are  believed to be spies have been seen examining the bridges on the Natal  Railway, and it is known that there are spies in all the principal  centres of the colony. In the opinion of Ministers, such a catastrophe  as the seizure of Laing's Nek and the destruction of the northern  portion of the railway, or a successful raid or invasion such as  they have reason to believe is contemplated, would produce a most  demoralising effect on the natives and on the loyal Europeans in the  colony, and would afford great encouragement to the Boers"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30691"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science, December 1930 (#11)"],[1,"-\" He stopped abruptly, then chewed in silence  upon a fruit like a striped pepper that stung his mouth and tongue while  he scarcely felt it. References to Earth things plainly were to be  avoided: the visions they brought before one's eyes were unnerving.    They made a pretence of sleeping in case they were being observed, and  it was some hours later when the two stood quietly beside the open  window. As Sykes had seen, there were branches of a pale, twisted  tree-growth close outside. McGuire tried his weight upon them, then  swung himself out, hand over hand, upon the branch that bent low beneath  him. Sykes was close behind when he clambered to the ground to stand for  some minutes, listening silently in the dark.    \"Too easy!\" the lieutenant whispered. \"They are too foxy to leave  a gateway like that--but here we are. The shore is off in this  direction.\"    The dark of a night unrelieved by a single star was about them as they  moved noiselessly away. They followed open ground at first. The building  that had been their brief prison was upon their right; beyond and at the  left was where the ship landed--it was gone now--and beyond that the  wall of vegetation.    And again, in the dark, McGuire had an uncanny sense of motion. Soft  bodies were slipping quietly one upon another; something that lived was  there beyond them in the night. No sound or sign of life came from the  house; no guard had been posted; and McGuire stopped again, before  plunging into the tangled growth, to whisper, \"Too easy, Sykes! There's  something about this--\"           *       *       *       *       *    He had pushed aside the fronds of a giant fern; a cautious step  beyond his hands touched a slippery, pliant vine. And his whisper  ended as he felt the thing turn and twist beneath his hand. It was  alive!--writhing!--cold as the body of a monster snake, and just as  vicious and savage in the way that it whipped down and about him in  the gloom of the starless night.    The thing was alive! It threw its coils around his body in an embrace  that left him breathless; a slender tendril was tightening about his  neck; his hands and arms were bound.    His ankle was grasped as he was whirled aloft--a human hand that gripped  him this time--and Sykes, forgetting discretion and the need for  silence, was shouting in the darkness that gave no clue to their  opponent. \"Hang on!\" he yelled. \"I've got you, Mac!\"    His shouts were cut short by another serpent shape that thrashed him and  smashed the softer growing things to earth that it might wrap this man,  too, in its deadly coils.    McGuire felt his companion's hold loosen as he was lifted from the  ground; there were other arms flailing about him--living, coiling things  that seemed to fight one with another for this prize. Abruptly,  blindingly, the scene was vividly etched before him: the strange trees,  the ferns, the writhing and darting serpent-arms! They were illumined in  a dazzling, white light!    He was in the air, clutched strangely in constricting arms; an odor of  rotted flesh was in his nostrils, sickening, suffocating! Beyond and  almost beneath him a cauldron of green gaped open, and he saw within it  a pool of thick liquid that eddied and steamed to give off the stench  of putrescence.    All this in an instant of vision--and in that instant he knew the death  they courted. It was a giant pod that held that pool--one of the growths  he had seen ranged out like a line of sentinels. But the terrible  tendrils that had been coiled and at rest were wrapped about him now,  drawing him to that reeking pool of death and the waiting thick lips  that would close above him. Sykes, too! The tendrils that had clutched  him were whisking his helpless body where another gaping mouth was  open--           *       *       *       *       *    And then, in the blazing light that was more brilliant than any light of  day in this world, the hold about McGuire relaxed. He saw, as he fell,  the thick, green lips snap shut; and the arms that had held him pulled  back into harmless, tight-wound coils.    Their bodies crashed to earth where a great fern bent beneath them to  cushion their fall. And the men lay silent and gasping for great choking  breaths, while from the building beyond came the cackle and shrieking of  man-things in manifest enjoyment of the frustrated plans.    It was the laughter that determined McGuire.    \"Damn the plants!\" he said between hoarse breaths. \"Man-eating  plants--but they're--better--than--those devils! And there's only--one  line of them: I saw them here before. Shall we go on?--make a break for  it?\"    Sykes rolled to the shelter of an arching frond and, without a word,  went crawling away. McGuire was behind him, and the two, as they came to  open ground, sprang to their feet and ran on through the weird orchard  where tree trunks made dim, twisting lines. They ran blindly and  helplessly toward the outer dark that promised temporary shelter.    A hopeless attempt: both men, knew the futility of it, while they  stumbled onward through the dark. Behind them the night was hideous  with noise as the great palace gave forth an eruption of shrieking,  inhuman forms that scattered with whistling and wailing calls in all  directions.           *       *       *       *       *    A mile or more of groping, hopeless flight, till a yellow gleam shone  among the trees to guide them. A building, beyond a clearing, gave a  bright illumination to the black night.    \"We've run in a circle,\" choked McGuire, his voice weak and uncertain  with exhaustion. \"Like a couple of fools!--\"    He waited until the heavy breathing that shook his body might be  controlled, then corrected himself. \"No--this is another--a new one--see  the towers! And listen--it's a radio station!\"    The slender frameworks that towered high in air glowed like flame--a  warning to the ships whose lights showed now and then far overhead. And,  clear and distinct, there came to the listening men the steady,  crackling hiss of an uninterrupted signal.    Against the lighted building moving figures showed momentarily, and  McGuire pulled his friend into the safe concealment of a tangle of  growth, while the group of yelling things sped past.    \"Come on,\" he told Sykes; \"we can't get away--not a chance! Let's have a  look at this place, and perhaps--well, I have an idea!\" He slipped  silently, cautiously on, where a forest of jungle ferns gave promise of  safe passage.           *       *       *       *       *    Some warning had been sounded; the occupants of the building were  scattered to aid in the man-hunt. Only one was left in the room where  two Earth-men peeped in at the door.    The figure was seated upon an insulated platform, and his long hands  manipulated keys and levers on a table before him. McGuire and Sykes  stared amazedly at this broadcasting station whose air was filled with a  pandemonium of crashing sound from some distant room, but McGuire was  concerned mainly with the motion of a lean, blood-red hand that swung  an object like a pointer in free-running sweeps above a dial on the  table. And he detected a variation in the din from beyond as the pointer  moved swiftly.    Here was the control board for those messages he had heard; this was the  instrument that varied the sending mechanism to produce the wailing  wireless cries that made words in some far-distant ears. McGuire, as he  slipped into the room and crept within leaping distance of the grotesque  thing so like yet unlike a man, was as silent as the nameless, writhing  horror that had seized them in the dark. He sprang, and the two came  crashing to the floor.    Lean arms came quickly about him to clutch and tear at his face, but the  flyer had an arm free, and one blow ended the battle. The man of Venus  relaxed to a huddle of purple and yellow cloth from which a ghastly face  protruded. McGuire leaped to his feet and sprang to the place where the  other had been.    \"Hold them off as long as you can!\" he shouted to Sykes, and his hand  closed upon the pointer.    Did this station send where he was hoping? Was this the station that had  communicated with the ship that had hovered above their flying field in  that far-off land? He did not know, but it was a powerful station, and  there was a chance--           *       *       *       *       *    He moved the pointer frantically here and there, swung it to one side  and another; then found at last a point on the outside of the strange  design beneath his hand where the pointer could rest while the crashing  crackle of sound was stilled.    And now he swung the pointer--upon the plate--anywhere!--and the noise  from beyond told instantly of the current's passage. He held it an  instant, then pushed it back to the silent spot--a dash! A quick return  that flashed back again to bring silence--a dot! More dashes and dots  ... and McGuire thanked a kindly heaven that had permitted him to learn  the language of the air, while he cursed his slowness in sending.    Would it reach? Would there be anyone to hear? No certainty; he could  only flash the wild Morse symbols out into the night. He must try to get  word to them--warn them! And \"Blake,\" he called, and spelled out the  name of their field, \"warning--Venus--\"    \"Hold them!\" he yelled to Sykes at the sound of rushing feet. \"Keep them  off as long as you can!\"    \"... Prepare--for invasion. Blake, this is McGuire....\" Over and over,  he worked the swinging pointer into symbols that might in some way, by  some fortunate chance, help that helpless people to resist the horror  that lay ahead.    And while heavy bodies crashed against the door that Sykes was holding,  there came from some deep-hidden well of memory an inspiration. There  was a man he had once met--a man who had confided wondrous things; and  now, with the knowledge of these others who had conquered space, he  could believe wholly what he had"]]]
