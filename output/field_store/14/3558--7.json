The moment of true noon, which is  not the same as ordinary or civil noon, never does agree exactly with  the time of the vernal or autumnal equinox, and may be removed from it  by any interval of time not exceeding twelve hours. And there are many  other circumstances which would lead astronomers, like those who  doubtless presided over the scientific preparations for building the  great pyramid, to prefer a means of determining the latitude depending  on another principle. The stellar heavens would afford practically  unchanging indications for their purpose. The stars being all carried  round the pole of the heavens, as if they were fixed points in the  interior of a hollow revolving sphere, it becomes possible to determine  the position of the pole of the star sphere, even though no bright  conspicuous star actually occupies that point. Any bright star close by  the pole is seen to revolve in a very small circle, whose centre is the  pole itself. Such a star is our present so-called pole-star; and, though  in the days when the great pyramid was built, that star was not near the  pole, another, and probably a brighter star lay near enough to the  pole[17] to serve as a pole-star, and to indicate by its circling motion  the position of the actual pole of the heavens. This was at that time,  and for many subsequent centuries, the leading star of the great  constellation called the Dragon.    The pole of the heavens, we know, varies in position according to the  latitude of the observer. At the north pole it is exactly overhead; at  the equator the poles of the heavens are both on the horizon; and, as  the observer travels from the equator towards the north or south pole of  the earth, the corresponding pole of the heavens rises higher and higher  above the horizon. In latitude 30 deg. north, or one-third of the way from  the equator to the pole, the pole of the heavens is raised one-third of  the way from the horizon to the point vertically overhead; and when this  is the case the observer knows that he is in latitude 30 deg. The builders  of the great pyramid, with the almost constantly clear skies of Egypt,  may reasonably be supposed to have adopted this means of determining the  true position of that thirtieth parallel on which they appear to have  designed to place the great building they were about to erect.    It so happens that we have the means of forming an opinion on the  question whether they used one method or the other; whether they  employed the sun or the stars to guide them to the geographical position  they required. In fact, were it not for this circumstance, I should not  have thought it worth while to discuss the qualities of either method.  It will presently be seen that the discussion bears importantly on the  opinion we are to form of the skill and attainments of the pyramid  architects. Every celestial object is apparently raised somewhat above  its true position by the refractive power of our atmosphere, being most  raised when nearest the horizon and least when nearest the point  vertically overhead. This effect is, indeed, so marked on bodies close  to the horizon that if the astronomers of the pyramid times had observed  the sun, moon, and stars attentively when so placed, they could not have  failed to discover the peculiarity. Probably, however, though they noted  the time of rising and setting of the celestial bodies, they only made  instrumental observations upon them when these bodies were high in the  heavens. Thus they remained ignorant of the refractive powers of the  air.[18] Now, if they had determined the position of the thirtieth  parallel of latitude by observations of the noonday sun (in spring or  autumn), then since, owing to refraction, they would have judged the sun  to be higher than he really was, it follows that they would have  supposed the latitude of any station from which they observed to be  lower than it really was. For the lower the latitude the higher is the  noonday sun at any given season. Thus, when really in latitude 30 deg.  they would have supposed themselves in a latitude lower than 30 deg., and  would have travelled a little further north to find the proper place, as  they would have supposed, for erecting the great pyramid. On the other  hand, if they determined the place from observations of the movements of  stars near the pole of the heavens, they would make an error of a  precisely opposite nature. For the higher the latitude the higher is the  pole of the heavens; and refraction, therefore, which apparently raises  the pole of the heavens, gives to a station the appearance of being in  a higher latitude than it really is, so that the observer would consider  he was in latitude 30 north when in reality somewhat south of that  latitude. We have only then to inquire whether the great pyramid was set  north or south of latitude 30 deg., to ascertain whether the pyramid  architects observed the noonday sun or circumpolar stars to determine  their latitude; always assuming (as we reasonably may) that those  architects did propose to set the pyramid in that particular latitude,  and that they were able to make very accurate observations of the apparent  positions of the celestial bodies, but that they were not acquainted  with the refractive effects of the atmosphere. The answer comes in no  doubtful terms. The centre of the great pyramid's base lies about one  mile and a third _south_ of the thirtieth parallel of latitude; and from  this position the pole of the heavens, as raised by refraction, would  appear to be very near indeed to the required position. In fact, if the  pyramid had been set about half a mile still farther south the pole  would have _seemed_ just right.    Of course, such an explanation as I have here suggested appears  altogether heretical to the pyramidalists. According to them the pyramid  architects knew perfectly well where the true thirtieth parallel lay,  and knew also all that modern science has discovered about refraction;  but set the pyramid south of the true parallel and north of the position  where refraction would just have made the apparent elevation of the pole  correct, simply in order that the pyramid might correspond as nearly as  possible to each of two conditions, whereof both could not be fulfilled  at once. The pyramid would indeed, they say, have been set even more  closely midway between the true and the apparent parallels of 30 deg.  north, but that the Jeezeh hill on which it is set does not afford a rock  foundation any farther north. 'So very close,' says Professor Smyth,  'was the great pyramid placed to the northern brink of its hill, that  the edges of the cliff might have broken off under the terrible  pressure had not the builders banked up there most firmly the immense  mounds of rubbish which came from their work, and which Strabo looked so  particularly for 1800 years ago, but could not find. Here they were,  however, and still are, utilised in enabling the great pyramid to stand  on the very utmost verge of its commanding hill, within the limits of  the _two_ required latitudes, as well as over the centre of the land's  physical and radial formation, and at the same time on the sure and  proverbially wise foundation of rock.'    The next circumstance to be noted in the position of the great pyramid  (as of all the pyramids) is that the sides are carefully oriented. This,  like the approximation to a particular latitude, must be regarded as an  astronomical rather than a geographical relation. The accuracy with  which the orientation has been effected will serve to show how far the  builders had mastered the methods of astronomical observation by which  orientation was to be secured. The problem was not so simple as might be  supposed by those who are not acquainted with the way in which the  cardinal points are correctly determined. By solar observations, or  rather by the observations of shadows cast by vertical shafts before and  after noon, the direction of the meridian, or north and south line, can  theoretically be ascertained. But probably in this case, as in  determining the latitude, the builders took the stars for their guide.  The pole of the heavens would mark the true north; and equally the  pole-star, when below or above the pole, would give the true north, but,  of course, most conveniently when below the pole. Nor is it difficult to  see how the builders would make use of the pole-star for this purpose.  From the middle of the northern side of the intended base they would  bore a slant passage tending always from the position of the pole-star  at its lower meridional passage, that star at each successive return to  that position serving to direct their progress; while its small range,  east and west of the pole, would enable them most accurately to  determine the star's true mid-point below the pole; that is, the true  north. When they had thus obtained a slant tunnel pointing truly to the  meridian, and had carried it down to a point nearly below the middle of  the proposed square base, they could, from the middle of the base, bore  vertically downwards, until by rough calculation they were near the  lower end of the slant tunnel; or both tunnels could be made at the same  time. Then a subterranean chamber would be opened out from the slant  tunnel. The vertical boring, which need not be wider than necessary to  allow a plumb-line to be suspended down it, would enable the architects  to determine the point vertically below the point of suspension. The  slant tunnel would give the direction of the true north, either from  that point or from a point at some known small distance east or west of  that point.[19] Thus, a line from some ascertained point near the mouth  of the vertical boring to the mouth of the slant tunnel would lie due  north and south, and serve as the required guide for the orientation of  the pyramid's base. If this base extended"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26598"],[0,"Seasoning of Wood (#11)"],[1,"is much  esteemed for its beauty. Cherry is chiefly used as a decorative  interior finishing lumber, for buildings, cars and boats, also for  furniture and in turnery, for musical instruments, walking sticks,  last blocks, and woodenware. It is becoming too costly for many  purposes for which it is naturally well suited. The lumber-furnishing  cherry of the United States, the wild black cherry, is a small to  medium-sized tree, scattered through many of the broad-leaved trees of  the western slope of the Alleghanies, but found from Michigan to  Florida, and west to Texas. Other species of this genus, as well as  the hawthornes (_Prunus cratoegus_) and wild apple (_Pyrus_), are not  commonly offered in the markets. Their wood is of the same character  as cherry, often finer, but in smaller dimensions.    =25. Red Cherry= (_Prunus Pennsylvanica_) (Wild Red Cherry, Bird  Cherry). Small-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood pale yellow.  Wood light, soft, and close-grained. Uses similiar to the preceding,  common throughout the Northern States, reaching its greatest size on  the mountains of Tennessee.                                     CHESTNUT    The chestnut is a long-lived tree, attaining an age of from 400 to 600  years, but trees over 100 years are usually hollow. It grows quickly,  and sprouts from a chestnut stump (Coppice Chestnut) often attain a  height of 8 feet in the first year. It has a fairly cylindrical stem,  and often grows to a height of 100 feet and over. Coppice chestnut,  that is, chestnut grown on an old stump, furnishes better timber for  working than chestnut grown from the nut, it is heavier, less spongy,  straighter in grain, easier to split, and stands exposure longer.    =26. Chestnut= (_Castanea vulgaris_ var. _Americana_). Medium-to  large-sized tree, never forming forests. Wood is light, moderately  hard, stiff, elastic, not strong, but very durable when in contact  with the soil, of coarse texture. Sapwood light, heartwood darker  brown, and is readily distinguishable from the sapwood, which very  early turns into heartwood. It shrinks and checks considerably in  drying, works easily, stands well. The annual rings are very distinct,  medullary rays very minute and not visible to the naked eye. Used in  cooperage, for cabinetwork, agricultural implements, railway ties,  telegraph poles, fence posts, sills, boxes, crates, coffins,  furniture, fixtures, foundation for veneer, and locally in heavy  construction. Very common in the Alleghanies. Occurs from Maine to  Michigan and southward to Alabama.    =27. Chestnut= (_Castanea dentata_ var. _vesca_). Medium-sized tree,  never forming forests, not common. Heartwood brown color, sapwood  lighter shade, coarse-grained. Wood and uses similar to the preceding.  Occurs scattered along the St. Lawrence River, and even there is met  with only in small quantities.    =28. Chinquapin= (_Castanea pumila_). Medium- to small-sized tree, with  wood slightly heavier, but otherwise similiar to the preceding. Most  common in Arkansas, but with nearly the same range as _Castanea  vulgaris_.    =29. Chinquapin= (_Castanea chrysophylla_). A medium-sized tree of the  western ranges of California and Oregon.                                    COFFEE TREE    =30. Coffee Tree= (_Gymnocladus dioicus_) (Coffee Nut, Stump Tree). A  medium- to large-sized tree, not common. Wood heavy, hard, strong,  very stiff, of coarse texture, and durable. Sapwood yellow, heartwood  reddish brown, shrinks and checks considerably in drying, works well  and stands well, and takes a fine polish. It is used to a limited  extent in cabinetwork and interior finish. Pennsylvania to Minnesota  and Arkansas.                              COTTONWOOD (See Poplar)                                    CRAB APPLE    =31. Crab Apple= (_Pyrus coronaria_) (Wild Apple, Fragrant Crab).  Small-sized tree. Heartwood reddish brown, sapwood yellow. Wood heavy,  hard, not strong, close-grained. Used principally for tool handles and  small domestic articles. Most abundant in the middle and western  states, reaches its greatest size in the valleys of the lower Ohio  basin.                           CUCUMBER TREE (See Magnolia)                                      DOGWOOD    =32. Dogwood= (_Cornus florida_) (American Box). Small to medium-sized  tree. Attains a height of about 30 feet and about 12 inches in  diameter. The heartwood is a red or pinkish color, the sapwood, which  is considerable, is a creamy white. The wood has a dull surface and  very fine grain. It is valuable for turnery, tool handles, and  mallets, and being so free from silex, watchmakers use small splinters  of it for cleaning out the pivot holes of watches, and opticians for  removing dust from deep-seated lenses. It is also used for butchers'  skewers, and shuttle blocks and wheel stock, and is suitable for  turnery and inlaid work. Occurs scattered in all the broad-leaved  forests of our country; very common.                                        ELM    Wood heavy, hard, strong, elastic, very tough, moderately durable in  contact with the soil, commonly cross-grained, difficult to split and  shape, warps and checks considerably in drying, but stands well if  properly seasoned. The broad sapwood whitish, heartwood light brown,  both with shades of gray and red. On split surfaces rough, texture  coarse to fine, capable of high polish. Elm for years has been the  principal wood used in slack cooperage for barrel staves, also in the  construction of cars, wagons, etc., in boat building, agricultural  implements and machinery, in saddlery and harness work, and  particularly in the manufacture of all kinds of furniture, where the  beautiful figures, especially those of the tangential or bastard  section, are just beginning to be appreciated. The elms are medium- to  large-sized trees, of fairly rapid growth, with stout trunks; they  form no forests of pure growth, but are found scattered in all the  broad-leaved woods of our country, sometimes forming a considerable  portion of the arborescent growth.    =33. White Elm= (_Ulmus Americana_) (American Elm, Water Elm). Medium-  to large-sized tree. Wood in its quality and uses as stated above.  Common. Maine to Minnesota, southward to Florida and Texas.    =34. Rock Elm= (_Ulmus racemosa_) (Cork Elm, Hickory Elm, White Elm,  Cliff Elm). Medium- to large-sized tree of rapid growth. Heartwood  light brown, often tinged with red, sapwood yellowish or greenish  white, compact structure, fibres interlaced. Wood heavy, hard, very  tough, strong, elastic, difficult to split, takes a fine polish. Used  for agricultural implements, automobiles, crating, boxes, cooperage,  tool handles, wheel stock, bridge timbers, sills, interior finish,  and maul heads. Fairly free from knots and has only a small quantity  of sapwood. Michigan, Ohio, from Vermont to Iowa, and southward to  Kentucky.    =35. Red Elm= (_Ulmus fulva_ var. _pubescens_) (Slippery Elm, Moose  Elm). The red or slippery elm is not as large a tree as the white elm  (_Ulmus Americana_), though it occasionally attains a height of 135  feet and a diameter of 4 feet. It grows tall and straight, and thrives  in river valleys. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, tough, elastic,  commonly cross-grained, moderately durable in contact with the soil,  splits easily when green, works fairly well, and stands well if  properly handled. Careful seasoning and handling are essential for the  best results. Trees can be utilized for posts when very small. When  green the wood rots very quickly in contact with the soil. Poles for  posts should be cut in summer and peeled and dried before setting. The  wood becomes very tough and pliable when steamed, and is of value for  sleigh runners and for ribs of canoes and skiffs. Together with white  elm (_Ulmus Americana_) it is extensively used for barrel staves in  slack cooperage and also for furniture. The thick, viscous inner bark,  which gives the tree its descriptive name, is quite palatable,  slightly nutritious, and has a medicinal value. Found chiefly along  water courses. New York to Minnesota, and southward to Florida and  Texas.    =36. Cedar Elm= (_Ulmus crassifolia_). Medium- to small-sized tree,  locally quite common. Arkansas and Texas.    =37. Winged Elm= (_Ulmus alata_) (Wahoo). Small-sized tree, locally  quite common. Heartwood light brown, sapwood yellowish white. Wood  heavy, hard, tough, strong, and close-grained. Arkansas, Missouri, and  eastern Virginia.        [Illustration: Fig. 10. A Large Red Gum.]                                        GUM    This general term applies to three important species of gum in the  South, the principal one usually being distinguished as \"red\" or  \"sweet\" gum (see Fig. 10). The next in importance being the \"tupelo\"  or \"bay poplar,\" and the least of the trio is designated as \"black\" or  \"sour\" gum (see Fig. 11). Up to the year 1900 little was known of gum  as a wood for cooperage purposes, but by the continued advance in  price of the woods used, a few of the most progressive manufacturers,  looking into the future, saw that the supply of the various woods in  use was limited, that new woods would have to be sought, and gum was  looked upon as a possible substitute, owing to its cheapness and  abundant supply. No doubt in the future this wood will be used to a  considerable extent in the manufacture of both \"tight\" and \"slack\"  cooperage. In the manufacture of the gum, unless the knives and saws  are kept very sharp, the wood has a tendency to break out, the corners  splitting off; and also, much difficulty has been experienced in  seasoning and kiln-drying.        [Illustration: Fig. 11. A Tupelo Gum Slough.]    In the past, gum, having no marketable value, has been left standing  after logging operations, or, where the land has been cleared for  farming, the trees have been \"girdled\" and allowed to rot, and then  felled and burned as trash.
