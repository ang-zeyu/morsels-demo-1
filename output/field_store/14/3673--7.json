[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#11)"],[1," had gathered in groups  and were fighting desperately to the last.  Here and there mounted men  strove to cut their way through the Zulus, while numbers of fugitives  could be seen making for the river, hotly pursued by crowds of the  enemy, who speared them as they ran.    \"It is frightful, frightful, Tom!  I cannot bear to look at it.\"    For a few minutes the fight continued.  The crack of the rifles was  heard less frequently now.  The exulting yell of the Zulus rose louder  and louder.  On the right Colonel Durnford with his cavalry essayed to  make one last stand to check the pursuit of the Zulus and give time for  the fugitives to escape; but it was in vain, showers of assegais fell  among them, and the Zulu crowd surged round.    For a time the boys thought all were lost, but a few horsemen cut their  way through the crowd and rode for the river.  The artillery had long  before ceased to fire, and the gunners lay speared by the cannons.  The  first shot had been fired at half-past eleven, by one o'clock all was  over.  The last white man had fallen, and the Zulus swarmed like a vast  body of ants over the camp in search of plunder.    Horror-stricken and sick, the boys shrank back against the rock behind  them, and for some time sobbed bitterly over the dreadful massacre which  had taken place before their eyes.  But after a time they began to talk  more quietly.    \"Will they come up here, do you think, Dick?\"    \"No, I don't think so,\" Dick replied.  \"They could hardly have seen us  come up here, even if they had been on the look-out on the hills, and as  they reached the back of the mountain before the camp was taken, they  will know that nobody could have come up afterwards.  Lie back here; we  cannot possibly be seen from below.  They will be too much taken up with  plundering the camp to think of searching this hill.  What on earth is  the general doing?--I can see his troops right away on the plain.  Surely he must have heard the guns?  Our only hope now is that when he  hears it he will march straight back; but, even if he does, I fear that  the Zulus will be too strong for him.  The whole force which he has with  him is no stronger than that which has been crushed here, and I don't  expect the native regiments can make much stand if attacked by such a  tremendously strong force.\"    So long as the daylight lasted, the boys, peering occasionally over,  could see the Zulus at the work of plundering.  All the sacks and  barrels were taken from the waggons and cut or broken open, each man  taking as much as he could carry of the tea, sugar, flour, and other  necessaries; many of the yoke-oxen were assegaied at once, and cut up  and eaten, the rest being driven off towards the north by a party of  warriors.    At nightfall the tents were set on fire; they soon burnt out, and the  boys could no longer see what was taking place.  Rising from the  shelter, they walked back to the other side of the crest.    \"I can hear firing now,\" Dick said; \"it seems to me that it is back at  Rorke's Drift.\"    They were soon sure that they were not mistaken; as it grew darker a  flittering light was seen in that direction, and a continued fire of  distant musketry was heard.  Later on there was a broad glare in the  sky.    \"I fear it is all over there too,\" Dick said, \"and that the place has  been burnt.\"    Still, however, the firing continued, as heavy as ever, and long on into  the night the lads sat listening to it.  At last they fell asleep, and  when they awoke the sun was already high.  Thus they missed their chance  of escape.    At nine o'clock in the evening Lord Chelmsford's force, hearing at last  what had happened, marched back into the camp, and before day had fairly  broken continued their way down to Rorke's Drift.  The defenders here, a  little garrison, under Lieutenant Bromhead of the 24th, and Chard of the  Royal Artillery, had made an heroic defence against some 4000 of the  enemy.  With mealy bags and boxes they built up a breastwork, and this  they held all night, in spite of the desperate efforts of the Zulus to  capture it.  The hospital, which stood at one end of the intrenchment,  was carried and burnt by the Zulus, but the little garrison held out  till morning in an inner intrenchment round the store-house.    Here was seen what could be done in the way of defence by the aid of  hastily-thrown-up intrenchments; and had breastworks been erected at  Isandula, as they ought to have been the instant the troops arrived  there, and still more so when the major portion of the column marched  away, the force there, small as it was, would doubtless have made a  successful resistance.  Even had the step been taken, when the Zulus  were first seen approaching, of forming a laager--that is, of drawing up  the waggons in the form of a hollow square--at the foot of the steep  mountain, the disaster might have been averted.  It may be said that the  massacre of Isandula was due entirely to the over-confidence and  carelessness of the officers in command of the column.    The boys on waking crawled back cautiously to a spot where they could  obtain a view over the valley, and, to their surprise, the force which,  on the afternoon before, they had seen out there had entirely  disappeared.  Many bodies of Zulus were seen moving about, but there was  no trace of the white troops.  They made their way to the back of the  hill, and then, to their horror, saw the column moving away from them,  and already half-way on its road to Rorke's Drift.    Their first impulse was to get up and start off in a run in pursuit of  it, but this feeling lasted but a moment, for between the hill and the  column many scattered parties of Zulus were to be seen.  The boys looked  blankly at each other.  It was but too clear that they were cut off and  alone in the enemy's country.    \"Whatever shall we do, Dick?\"    \"I have not the least idea, Tom.  At any rate there is nothing to be  done at present.  We should be assegaied in a moment if we were to go  down; let's go back to our old look-out.\"    After much talk they agreed that it would be hopeless to attempt to make  south and cross the Buffalo, as many of the fugitives had done.  There  were sure to be strong bodies of Zulus along the river, and even if they  passed these without detection they would be unable to cross the river,  as they would find no ford, and neither of them was able to swim.    There were great numbers of Zulus in the camp below, and these seemed to  be pursuing the work of plundering more minutely than they had done on  the previous day.  The stores scattered recklessly about were collected,  placed in empty barrels, and loaded up on the waggons.  Presently a  number of cattle were brought down; these were harnessed to the waggons  and driven off, and by nightfall nothing save scattered remnants marked  the place where the British camp had stood.  But from their post the  boys could see that the ground far and near was dotted with corpses,  black and white.    After nightfall the boys descended to the camp, and having marked the  exact spot where the waggons had stood were able to collect a number of  pieces of the broken biscuit scattered about; they were fortunate enough  to light upon a water-bottle still full, and with these treasures they  returned to the post on the mountain.  They had agreed to wait there for  three or four days, in fact as long as they could hold out, and then  quietly to walk into one of the native kraals.  If caught in the act of  flight they were certain of being killed, but they hoped that when the  Zulus' blood had cooled down after the conflict their lives might  possibly be spared.    This plan was carried out; for four days they remained on the hill of  Isandula, and then descending late one evening to the plain walked for  ten or twelve miles north, and waiting until daybreak showed them a  large native kraal at no great distance, they made for it, and sat  quietly down at the door of the principal hut.  Presently a girl issued  from a neighbouring hut, and, upon seeing them, gave a scream and ran  back again.  The cry brought others to the doors of the huts.  When the  boys were seen, a perfect hubbub of tongues broke forth, and many of the  men, running out with their spears, advanced towards the lads.  They sat  perfectly quiet, and held up their hands to show that they were unarmed.  The Zulus hesitated.  Dick went through the motion of eating and  drinking, and in his best Kaffir begged for a glass of water.    The Zulus, seeing that the boys were alone, approached them, and began  to ask them questions, and were evidently much surprised at hearing that  they had escaped from the massacre of the British.  From the door of the  hut in which they were sitting a chief, evidently of high rank, for the  others greeted him respectfully, now came out.    After the cause of the tumult was explained to the chief, he ordered the  boys to be bound.  This was done and they were put into an empty hut  while their fate was decided upon; after much deliberation it was agreed  by the Zulus that, as they were but boys and had come into the camp  unarmed and of their own accord, their lives should for the present be  spared.    It happened that in the village were a party of men who belonged to the  tribe of Umbelleni, whose territory lay to the north-west, and these  volunteered to take the prisoners to their chief, who was one of the  strongest opponents of the English.  His country, indeed, lay just  within the Zulu frontier, and, having been engaged in constant  skirmishes and broils with the Dutch settlers, he was even more  disappointed than the other chiefs at the taking over of the Transvaal  by England, just at the time when the Zulus were meditating its  conquest.    The road from Itelezi, the village at which the boys had given  themselves up, to Umbelleni's country ran along between the Blood River  and the lofty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#11)"],[1,"to hospital at 9      p.m. on 27th October, 1890, bitten on foot by a death adder, which      was killed and identified. Dr. Forbes reports: When seen by me,      two hours after the accident, he was sitting on his mother's knee      with his head hanging on one side, but quite conscious, and      answering questions rationally, pupils widely dilated with almost      no reaction to light, pulse very fast and soft, &c. Thinking his      condition might be due to fear I hesitated to use strychnine. So,      ordering strong coffee, I hurried to attend an accident case just      admitted with severe haemorrhage, and left the boy in charge of a      nurse, with orders to call me at once if she saw any change. I had      scarcely been away 15 minutes when the father rushed in saying his      boy was dead, and indeed his statement seemed but too true. The      child was lying quite limp, face blue, eyes half shut, extremities      very cold, no pulse perceptible, no respiration visible. I at once      injected m. x. of liq. strychniae P.B. and made artificial      respiration. He soon began to improve, and in about 20 minutes was      able to speak. He was watched all night, but suffered no relapse,      and was discharged on the next day.        CASES 19 TO 21, reported by Dr. Weekes, of Lithgow, N.S.W. Dr.      Weekes writes:--\"Within the last year I have had three cases under      my care, all bitten by black snakes, and all in about the same      place, on the outside of the calf of the leg. The patients were      all comatose, exhibiting all the usual symptoms of      snakebite-poisoning, and in one, my last case, _the patient had      convulsions_. In all of them I made hypodermic injections of m.      xv. liq. strych., and the effects were most marked, the patients      being completely roused and becoming quite sensible and rational      each time,\" &c.        CASE 22.--Mrs. Ryan, of Oberon, N.S.W., bitten on leg by tiger      snake, comatose and nearly pulseless after three hours, treated by      Dr. Kingsburry, amount of strychnine not stated.        CASE 23.--Benjamin Childs, bitten on finger by death adder,      treated by Dr. Campbell, of Grafton, N.S.W.        CASE 24.--Rather remarkable. Reported by Dr. Lloyd Parry, of      Emmaville, N.S.W., in _Gazette_ of March, 1891, and further      particulars in private correspondence with writer. A Chinese      miner, aged 30 years, was bitten on the back of the foot by a      death adder. His mates, deeming medical aid useless, did not send      for Dr. Parry until death was imminent, and then only with a view      of getting a certificate of death, and avoiding autopsy and      inquest. When seen, three hours after infliction of bite, the man      was deeply comatose and pulseless, skin icy cold, pupils dilated      and insensible to light, lower jaw hanging down and tongue      protruding, respiration scarcely perceptible. He was in fact so      near death that this event was expected to take place from minute      to minute. In order to task the antidote to the utmost, Dr. Parry      cut the tight ligature without excising the bitten skin and then      injected xv. of liq. st. P.B. To his surprise in a few minutes the      man began to groan and very soon afterwards became conscious. Dr.      Parry then watched him carefully and in about an hour found coma      returning, when another injection was made and roused him for      good. There was much swelling and effusion in the leg, but no ill      effects followed.        In this case, judging from the comparatively small quantity of the      antidote required, only a small amount of poison had been      imparted, the bite being on the back of the foot, where the fangs      cannot penetrate deeply. Still there can be no doubt that even      this small quantity of the justly dreaded death adder poison would      have proved fatal, if it had not been counteracted by the      antidote.        CASE 25, reported from Tasmania by Dr. Holmes, of Launceston,      presents different features, showing the very large quantity of      the antidote sometimes required. After describing the condition of      his patient, a Mrs. Frazer, of St. Leonards, Dr. Holmes      writes:--\"From her desperate condition I thought it too late for      the ammonia treatment and decided on injecting liq. strychniae. At      12.30 p.m. injected m. xv, at 1.40, m. xv., at 2.10, m. xv., at      2.40, m. xv., and 3.10, m. xv., at 4 p.m., m. x., and at 5, m. x.      A few minutes after the last dose I noticed the physiological      action of the drug and desisted from injecting. At 8 p.m. she      seemed almost well, pupils normal in size and reacting well, was      not sleepy and could swallow easily. The patient made a good      recovery.\"        This is the largest quantity of strychnine that has been required      in Australia, namely, 126 minims of liq. strych., or 1-1/9th gr.      injected in less than five hours, with the most beneficial result.      Surely the most cynical scepticism must give in to such facts.        CASE 26.--Reported by Dr. MacDonald, of Murwillumbah, N.S.W. Mr.      S., bitten on leg by a black snake. Coma, complete paralysis,      chin hanging down to sternum, pupils dilated, &c. An injection of      m. xv. had no effect; one of m. xx. very little. After a third one      of m. x. patient suddenly became conscious, could walk without      assistance, and in half an hour was sent to bed perfectly      recovered.        CASE 27.--Reported by Dr. Yeatman, of Auburn, South Australia. Mr.      D., a farmer, aged 45 years, bitten on thumb; snake not named;      cured by three injections of only m. v. each. Convulsions lasting      for an hour came on three hours after treatment--a very rare      occurrence--by Dr. Yeatman erroneously ascribed to the strychnine,      which in so small a dose would not have produced them in the      absence of snake-poison.        CASE 28.--Reported by officer in charge of police at Grenfell. Boy      of 6 years, bitten by brown snake, and treated by Dr. Rygate.        CASE 29.--W. Toomer, aged 19, bitten by tiger snake on thumb and      index finger, and not treated until 9-1/2 hours after bite, having      a long distance to travel. Recovery very slow through timid use of      antidote, five injections of 1/30th grain having but little      effect, until one of 1/10th restored him. Treated by Dr. Stokes,      of Echuca.        CASE 30.--Reported by Dr. Bennett, surgeon, Gulgong Hospital,      N.S.W. Mrs. Mears admitted to hospital comatose and pulseless,      nothing having been done to check absorption. The intravenous      injection of ammonia failing to rouse her, m. xv. of liq. strych.      were injected, when pulse returned, but coma continued. After a      second injection of m. xv. she suddenly became quite conscious,      and in an hour was fully restored.        CASE 31.--Reported by Dr. Mead, of Quirindi, N.S.W. John Simson,      aged 15 years, bitten by a death adder on forefinger of right      hand. Dr. Mead living 50 miles away, and the lad collapsing, a      layman, Mr. Robert Simson, had to undertake treatment, and      injected during the night m. 150 of a one in 240 solution of      strychnine, equal to 5/8ths of a grain. Dr. Mead, finding the lad      conscious and only a little drowsy, did not inject any more      strychnine until 2 p.m., when a relapse took place. He then      injected m. viii. of liq. str. P. B., and in half an hour m. vii.      more. The last injection produced slight muscular twitchings, and      subdued the snake-poison effectually, the lad making a good      recovery. The total quantity used in 13 injections was over      three-quarters of a grain within 18 hours.        CASE 32.--This case is another instance of the successful use of      the antidote by a layman, and can be verified by the writer, who      saw the patient, a girl of 14 years, after her father had carried      out the treatment successfully. The girl had been bitten by a      large brown snake whilst walking through a paddock, and very soon      afterwards lost the use of her legs, and for a time also her      eyesight. The symptoms being so very alarming, and the girl at a      distance of 35 miles from the writer's residence, the father at      once injected 1/12th of a grain of strychnine, and in a very short      time another 1/12th. The child then rallied somewhat, and a start      was made to bring her in, the father taking the precaution of      bringing the antidote-case with him. This was fortunate, for the      child collapsed several times, and each time had to be roused by      an injection before reaching the writer. When finally she      presented herself, walking into the writer's surgery with a firm      step, not a trace could be discovered either of the strychnine, of      which nearly half a grain had been injected, nor of the      snake-poison, also imparted no doubt in a fatal dose. The two      punctures on her leg, testifying to the size of the snake that had      bitten her, were the only tokens of the ordeal she had gone      through; and the only task remaining for the writer was to      congratulate her father (Mr. James Trebilcock, a farmer, of      Tawanga), on the plucky manner in which he had carried out the      treatment, and see to the child being properly watched during the      night in case of a relapse taking place. None, however, occurred,      and she left next morning perfectly well. Cases of this kind, in      which no doctor is called in, are frequently reported to the      writer, who finds that laymen are even more successful because      less timid than many medical men.        CASE 33.--Joseph Cartledge, bitten on calf of leg by a black      snake, was treated by Dr. Browne, of Sale, five hours after      accident. Two injections of 1/8th grain each used.        CASE 34.--Miss Davie, teacher, at Nerung, Queensland, treated by  "]]]
