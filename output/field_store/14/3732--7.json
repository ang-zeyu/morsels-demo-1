They painted their faces red and sang as they  danced, and they prayed to the weapons to preserve their husbands  and help them to kill many foes. Some had eagle-down stuck on the  points of their sticks. When the dance was over, these weapons were  hidden. If a woman whose husband was at the war thought she saw hair  or a piece of a scalp on the weapon when she took it out, she knew  that her husband had killed an enemy. But if she saw a stain of  blood on it, she knew he was wounded or dead. When the men of the  Yuki tribe in California were away fighting, the women at home did  not sleep; they danced continually in a circle, chanting and waving  leafy wands. For they said that if they danced all the time, their  husbands would not grow tired. Among the Haida Indians of the Queen  Charlotte Islands, when the men had gone to war, the women at home  would get up very early in the morning and pretend to make war by  falling upon their children and feigning to take them for slaves.  This was supposed to help their husbands to go and do likewise. If a  wife were unfaithful to her husband while he was away on the  war-path, he would probably be killed. For ten nights all the women  at home lay with their heads towards the point of the compass to  which the war-canoes had paddled away. Then they changed about, for  the warriors were supposed to be coming home across the sea. At  Masset the Haida women danced and sang war-songs all the time their  husbands were away at the wars, and they had to keep everything  about them in a certain order. It was thought that a wife might kill  her husband by not observing these customs. When a band of Carib  Indians of the Orinoco had gone on the war-path, their friends left  in the village used to calculate as nearly as they could the exact  moment when the absent warriors would be advancing to attack the  enemy. Then they took two lads, laid them down on a bench, and  inflicted a most severe scourging on their bare backs. This the  youths submitted to without a murmur, supported in their sufferings  by the firm conviction, in which they had been bred from childhood,  that on the constancy and fortitude with which they bore the cruel  ordeal depended the valour and success of their comrades in the  battle.    Among the many beneficent uses to which a mistaken ingenuity has  applied the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, is that of  causing trees and plants to bear fruit in due season. In Thüringen  the man who sows flax carries the seed in a long bag which reaches  from his shoulders to his knees, and he walks with long strides, so  that the bag sways to and fro on his back. It is believed that this  will cause the flax to wave in the wind. In the interior of Sumatra  rice is sown by women who, in sowing, let their hair hang loose down  their back, in order that the rice may grow luxuriantly and have  long stalks. Similarly, in ancient Mexico a festival was held in  honour of the goddess of maize, or \"the long-haired mother,\" as she  was called. It began at the time \"when the plant had attained its  full growth, and fibres shooting forth from the top of the green ear  indicated that the grain was fully formed. During this festival the  women wore their long hair unbound, shaking and tossing it in the  dances which were the chief feature in the ceremonial, in order that  the tassel of the maize might grow in like profusion, that the grain  might be correspondingly large and flat, and that the people might  have abundance.\" In many parts of Europe dancing or leaping high in  the air are approved homoeopathic modes of making the crops grow  high. Thus in Franche-Comté they say that you should dance at the  Carnival in order to make the hemp grow tall.    The notion that a person can influence a plant homoeopathically by  his act or condition comes out clearly in a remark made by a Malay  woman. Being asked why she stripped the upper part of her body naked  in reaping the rice, she explained that she did it to make the  rice-husks thinner, as she was tired of pounding thick-husked rice.  Clearly, she thought that the less clothing she wore the less husk  there would be on the rice. The magic virtue of a pregnant woman to  communicate fertility is known to Bavarian and Austrian peasants,  who think that if you give the first fruit of a tree to a woman with  child to eat, the tree will bring forth abundantly next year. On the  other hand, the Baganda believe that a barren wife infects her  husband's garden with her own sterility and prevents the trees from  bearing fruit; hence a childless woman is generally divorced. The  Greeks and Romans sacrificed pregnant victims to the goddesses of  the corn and of the earth, doubtless in order that the earth might  teem and the corn swell in the ear. When a Catholic priest  remonstrated with the Indians of the Orinoco on allowing their women  to sow the fields in the blazing sun, with infants at their breasts,  the men answered, \"Father, you don't understand these things, and  that is why they vex you. You know that women are accustomed to bear  children, and that we men are not. When the women sow, the stalk of  the maize bears two or three ears, the root of the yucca yields two  or three basketfuls, and everything multiplies in proportion. Now  why is that? Simply because the women know how to bring forth, and  know how to make the seed which they sow bring forth also. Let them  sow, then; we men don't know as much about it as they do.\"    Thus on the theory of homoeopathic magic a person can influence  vegetation either for good or for evil according to the good or the  bad character of his acts or states: for example, a fruitful woman  makes plants fruitful, a barren woman makes them barren. Hence this  belief in the noxious and infectious nature of certain personal  qualities or accidents has given rise to a number of prohibitions or  rules of avoidance: people abstain from doing certain things lest  they should homoeopathically infect the fruits of the earth with  their own undesirable state or condition. All such customs of  abstention or rules of avoidance are examples of negative magic or  taboo. Thus, for example, arguing from what may be called the  infectiousness of personal acts or states, the Galelareese say that  you ought not to shoot with a bow and arrows under a fruit-tree, or  the tree will cast its fruit even as the arrows fall to the ground;  and that when you are eating water-melon you ought not to mix the  pips which you spit out of your mouth with the pips which you have  put aside to serve as seed; for if you do, though the pips you spat  out may certainly spring up and blossom, yet the blossoms will keep  falling off just as the pips fell from your mouth, and thus these  pips will never bear fruit. Precisely the same train of thought  leads the Bavarian peasant to believe that if he allows the graft of  a fruit-tree to fall on the ground, the tree that springs from that  graft will let its fruit fall untimely. When the Chams of  Cochinchina are sowing their dry rice fields and desire that no  shower should fall, they eat their rice dry in order to prevent rain  from spoiling the crop.    In the foregoing cases a person is supposed to influence vegetation  homoeopathically. He infects trees or plants with qualities or  accidents, good or bad, resembling and derived from his own. But on  the principle of homoeopathic magic the influence is mutual: the  plant can infect the man just as much as the man can infect the  plant. In magic, as I believe in physics, action and reaction are  equal and opposite. The Cherokee Indians are adepts in practical  botany of the homoeopathic sort. Thus wiry roots of the catgut plant  are so tough that they can almost stop a plowshare in the furrow.  Hence Cherokee women wash their heads with a decoction of the roots  to make the hair strong, and Cherokee ball-players wash themselves  with it to toughen their muscles. It is a Galelareese belief that if  you eat a fruit which has fallen to the ground, you will yourself  contract a disposition to stumble and fall; and that if you partake  of something which has been forgotten (such as a sweet potato left  in the pot or a banana in the fire), you will become forgetful. The  Galelareese are also of opinion that if a woman were to consume two  bananas growing from a single head she would give birth to twins.  The Guarani Indians of South America thought that a woman would  become a mother of twins if she ate a double grain of millet. In  Vedic times a curious application of this principle supplied a charm  by which a banished prince might be restored to his kingdom. He had  to eat food cooked on a fire which was fed with wood which had grown  out of the stump of a tree which had been cut down. The recuperative  power manifested by such a tree would in due course be communicated  through the fire to the food, and so to the prince, who ate the food  which was cooked on the fire which was fed with the wood which grew  out of the tree. The Sudanese think that if a house is built of the  wood of thorny trees, the life of the people who dwell in that house  will likewise be thorny and full of trouble.    There is a fruitful branch of homoeopathic magic which works by  means of the dead; for just as the dead can neither see nor hear nor  speak, so you may on homoeopathic principles render people blind,  deaf and dumb by the use of dead men's bones or anything else that  is tainted by the infection of death. Thus among the Galelareese,  when a young man goes a-wooing at night, he takes a little earth  from a grave and strews it on the roof of his sweetheart's house  just above the place where her parents sleep. This, he fancies, will  prevent them from waking while he converses with his beloved, since  the earth from the grave will make them sleep as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36299"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#11)"],[1,"church dues, burial  fees and tithes. [This land] is to be held for all time and granted  along with the things both great and small belonging to it.\"         A Bishop gave land to a faithful attendant for his life and two other  lives as follows: \"In 904 A.D., I, Bishop Werfrith, with the permission  and leave of my honorable community in Worcester, grant to Wulfsige, my  reeve, for his loyal efficiency and humble obedience, one hide of land  at Aston as Herred held it, that is, surrounded by a dyke, for three  lives and then after three lives the estate shall be given back without  any controversy to Worcester.\"         At seaports on the coast, goods were loaded onto vessels owned by  English merchants to be transported to other English seaports. London  was a market town on the north side of the Thames River and the primary  port and trading center for foreign merchants. Streets that probably  date from this time include Milk, Bread, and Wood Streets, and Honey  Lane. There were open air markets such as Billingsgate. There were  wooden quays over much of the river front. Houses were made of wood,  with one sunken floor, or a ground floor with a cellar beneath. Some had  central stone hearths and earth latrines. There were crude pottery  cooking pots, beakers and lamps, wool cloth, a little silk, simple  leather shoes, pewter jewelry, looms, and quernstones (for grinding  flour). Wool, skins, hides, wheat, meal, beer, lead, cheese, salt, and  honey were exported. Wine (mostly for the church), fish, timber, pitch,  pepper, garlic, spices, copper, gems, gold, silk, dyes, oil, brass,  sulphur, glass, slaves, and elephant and walrus ivory were imported.  Goods from the continent were sold at open stalls in certain streets.  Furs and slaves were traded. There was a royal levy on exports by  foreigners merchants. Southwark, across the Thames River from London,was  reachable by a bridge. Southwark contained sleazy docks, prisons, gaming  houses, and brothels.         Guilds in London were first associations of neighbors for the purposes  of mutual assistance. They were fraternities of persons by voluntary  compact to assist each other in poverty, including their widows or  orphans and the portioning of poor maids, and to protect each other from  injury. Their essential features are and continue to be in the future:  1) oath of initiation, 2) entrance fee in money or in kind and a common  fund, 3) annual feast and mass, 4) meetings at least three times yearly  for guild business, 5) obligation to attend all funerals of members, to  bear the body if need be from a distance, and to provide masses for the  dead, 6) the duty of friendly help in cases of sickness, imprisonment,  house burning, shipwreck, or robbery, 7) rules for decent behavior at  meetings, and 8) provisions for settling disputes without recourse to  the law. Both the masses and the feast were attended by the women.  Frequently the guilds also had a religious ceremonial to affirm their  bonds of fidelity. They readily became connected with the exercise of  trades and with the training of apprentices. They promoted and took on  public purposes such as the repairing of roads and bridges, the relief  of pilgrims, the maintenance of schools and almshouses, and the periodic  performance of pageants and miracle plays telling scriptural history,  which could last for several days. The devil often was prominent in  miracle plays.         Many of these London guilds were known by the name of their founding  member. There were also Frith Guilds (peace guilds) and a Knights'  Guild. The Frith Guild's main object was to enforce the King's laws,  especially the prevalent problem of theft. They were especially  established by bishops and reeves. Members met monthly and contributed  about 4d. to a common fund, which paid a compensation for items stolen.  They each paid 1s. towards the pursuit of the thief. The members were  grouped in tens. Members with horses were to track the thief. Members  without horses worked in the place of the absent horse owners until  their return. When caught, the thief was tried and executed.  Overwhelming force was used if his kindred tried to protect him. His  property was used to compensate the victim for his loss and then divided  between the thief's wife, if she was innocent, the King, and the guild.  Owners of slaves paid into a fund to give one half compensation to those  who lost slaves by theft or escape, and recaptured slaves were to be  stoned to death or hanged. The members of the peace guild also feasted  and drank together. When one died, the others each sang a song or paid  for the singing of fifty psalms for his soul and gave a loaf.         The Knights' Guild was composed of thirteen military persons to whom  King Edgar granted certain waste land in the east of London, toward  Aldgate, and also Portsoken, which ran outside the eastern wall of the  city to the Thames, for prescribed services performed, probably defense  of the vulnerable east side of the city. This concession was confirmed  by King Edward the Confessor in a charter at the suit of certain  citizens of London, the successors of these knights. Edward granted them  sac and soke [cause and suit] jurisdiction over their men.         Edward the Confessor made these rules for London:        1.  Be it known that within the space of three miles from all parts  outside of the city a man ought not to hold or hinder another, and also  should not do business with him if he wish to come to the city under its  peace. But when he arrives in the city, then let the market be the same  to the rich man as to the poor.        2.  Be it also known that a man who is from the court of the king or the  barons ought not to lodge in the house of any citizen of London for  three nights, either by privilege or by custom, except by consent of the  host. For if he force the host to lodge him in his house and there be  killed by the host, let the host choose six from his relatives and let  him as the seventh swear that he killed him for the said cause. And thus  he will remain quit of the murder of the     deceased towards the king  and relatives and lords of the deceased.        3.  And after he has entered the city, let a foreign merchant be lodged  wherever it please him. But if he bring dyed cloth, let him see to it  that he does not sell his merchandise at retail, but that he sell not  less than a dozen pieces at a time. And if he bring pepper, or cumin, or  ginger, or alum, or brasil wood, or resin, or incense, let him sell not  less than fifteen pounds at a time. But if he bring belts, let him sell  not less than a thousand at a     time. And if he bring cloths of silk,  or wool or linen, let him see that he cut them not, but sell them whole.  But if he bring wax, let him sell not less than one quartanum. Also a  foreign merchant may not buy dyed cloth, nor make the dye in the city,  nor do any work which belongs by right to the citizens.        4.  Also no foreign merchant with his partner may set up any market  within the city for reselling goods in the city, nor may he approach a  citizen for making a bargain, nor may he stop longer in the City.         Every week in London there was a folkmote at St. Paul's churchyard,  where majority decision was a tradition. By 1032, it had lost much of  its power to the husting [household assembly in Danish] court. The  folkmote then had responsibility for order and was the sole authority  for proclaiming outlaws. It met three times a year at St. Paul's  churchyard and there acclaimed the sheriff and justiciar, or if the king  had chosen his officer, heard who was chosen and listened to his charge.  It also yearly arranged the watch and dealt with risks of fire. It was  divided into wards, each governed by an alderman who presided over the  wardmote, and represented his ward at the folkmote. Each guild became a  ward. The chief alderman was the portreeve. London paid one-eighth of  all the taxes of England.         Later in the towns, merchant guilds grew out of charity associations  whose members were bound by oath to each other and got together for a  guild feast every month. Some traders of these merchant guilds became so  prosperous that they became landholders. Many market places were  dominated by a merchant guild, which had a monopoly of the local trade.  In the great mercantile towns all the land and houses would be held by  merchants and their dependents, all freeholders were connected with a  trade, and everyone who had a claim on public office or magistry would  be a member of the guild. The merchant guild could admit into their  guild country villeins, who became freemen if unclaimed by their lords  for a year and a day. Every merchant who had made three long voyages on  his own behalf and at his own cost ranked as a thegn. There were also  some craft guilds composed of handicraftsmen or artisans. Escaped bonded  agricultural workers, poor people, and traders without land migrated to  towns to live, but were not citizens.         Towns were largely self-sufficient, but salt and iron came from a  distance. The King's established in every shire at least one town with a  market place where purchases would be witnessed, and a mint where  reliable money was coined by a moneyer, who put his name on his coins.  There were eight moneyers in London. Coins were issued to be of value  for only a couple of years. Then one had to exchange them for newly  issued ones at a rate of about 10 old for 8 or 9 new. The difference  constituted a tax. Roughly 10% of the people lived in towns. Some took  surnames such as Tanner, Weaver, or Carpenter. Some had affectionate or  derisive nicknames such as clear-hand, fresh friend, soft bread, foul  beard, money taker, or penny purse. Craftsmen in the 1000s included  goldsmiths, embroiderers, illuminators of manuscripts, and armorers.         Edward the Confessor, named such for his piety, was a"]]]
