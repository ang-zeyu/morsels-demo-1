Its  business will be twofold: to carry the warfare as much as possible to  the Hans, and to serve as a decoy, to keep their attention from our  plants. I'm going to need your help in this.    \"The other thing I wanted to talk to you about is this: Amazing and  impossible as it seems, there is a group, or perhaps an entire gang,  somewhere among us, that is betraying us to the Hans. It may be the Bad  Bloods, or it may be one of those gangs who live near one of the Han  cities. You know, a hundred and fifteen or twenty years ago there were  certain of these people's ancestors who actually degraded themselves by  mating with the Hans, sometimes even serving them as slaves, in the days  before they brought all their service machinery to perfection.    \"There is such a gang, called the Nagras, up near Bah-flo, and another  in Mid-Jersey that men call the Pineys. But I hardly suspect the Pineys.  There is little intelligence among them. They wouldn't have the  information to give the Hans, nor would they be capable of imparting it.  They're absolute savages.\"    \"Just what evidence is there that anybody has been clearing information  to the Hans?\" I asked.    \"Well,\" he replied, \"first of all there was that raid upon us. That  first Han ship knew the location of our plants exactly. You remember it  floated directly into position above the valley and began a systematic  beaming. Then, the Hans quite obviously have learned that we are picking  up their electrophone waves, for they've gone back to their old, but  extremely accurate, system of directional control. But we've been  getting them for the past week by installing automatic re-broadcast  units along the scar paths. This is what the Americans called those  strips of country directly under the regular ship routes of the Hans,  who as a matter of precaution frequently blasted them with their dis  beams to prevent the growth of foliage which might give shelter to the  Americans. But they've been beaming those paths so hard, it looks as  though they even had information of this strategy. And in addition,  they've been using code. Finally, we've picked up three of their  messages in which they discuss, with some nervousness, the existence of  our 'mysterious' ultrophone.\"    \"But they still have no knowledge of the nature and control of ultronic  activity?\" I asked.    \"No,\" said the Big Boss thoughtfully, \"they don't seem to have a bit of  information about it.\"    \"Then it's quite clear,\" I ventured, \"that whoever is 'clearing' us to  them is doing it piecemeal. It sounds like a bit of occasional barter,  rather than an out-and-out alliance. They're holding back as much  information as possible for future bartering, perhaps.\"    \"Yes,\" Hart said, \"and it isn't information the Hans are giving in  return, but some form of goods, or privilege. The trick would be to  locate the goods. I guess I'll have to make a personal trip around among  the Big Bosses.\"          CHAPTER VIII    The Han City      This conversation set me thinking. All of the Han electrophone  inter-communication had been an open record to the Americans for a good  many years, and the Hans were just finding it out. For centuries they  had not regarded us as any sort of a menace. Unquestionably it had never  occurred to them to secrete their own records. Somewhere in Nu-yok or  Bah-flo, or possibly in Lo-Tan itself, the record of this traitorous  transaction would be more or less openly filed. If we could only get at  it! I wondered if a raid might not be possible.    Bill Hearn and I talked it over with our Han-affairs Boss and his  experts. There ensued several days of research, in which the Han records  of the entire decade were scanned and analyzed. In the end they picked  out a mass of detail, and fitted it together into a very definite  picture of the great central filing office of the Hans in Nu-yok, where  the entire mass of official records was kept, constantly available for  instant projectoscoping to any of the city's offices, and of the system  by which the information was filed.    The attempt began to look feasible, though Hart instantly turned the  idea down when I first presented it to him. It was unthinkable, he said.  Sheer suicide. But in the end I persuaded him.    \"I will need,\" I said, \"Blash, who is thoroughly familiar with the Han  library system; Bert Gaunt, who for years has specialized on their  military offices; Bill Barker, the ray specialist, and the best swooper  pilot we have.\" _Swoopers_ are one-man and two-man ships, developed by  the Americans, with skeleton backbones of inertron (during the war  painted green for invisibility against the green forests below) and  \"bellies\" of clear ultron.    \"That will be Mort Gibbons,\" said Hart. \"We've only got three swoopers  left, Tony, but I'll risk one of them if you and the others will  voluntarily risk your existences. But mind, I won't urge or order one of  you to go. I'll spread the word to every Plant Boss at once to give you  anything and everything you need in the way of equipment.\"    When I told Wilma of the plan, I expected her to raise violent and  tearful objections, but she didn't. She was made of far sterner stuff  than the women of the 20th Century. Not that she couldn't weep as  copiously or be just as whimsical on occasion; but she wouldn't weep for  the same reasons.    She just gave me an unfathomable look, in which there seemed to be a bit  of pride, and asked eagerly for the details. I confess I was somewhat  disappointed that she could so courageously risk my loss, even though I  was amazed at her fortitude. But later I was to learn how little I knew  her then.    We were ready to slide off at dawn the next morning. I had kissed Wilma  good-bye at our camp, and after a final conference over our plans, we  boarded our craft and gently glided away over the tree tops on a course,  which, after crossing three routes of the Han ships, would take us out  over the Atlantic, off the Jersey coast, whence we would come up on  Nu-yok from the ocean.    Twice we had to nose down and lie motionless on the ground near a route  while Han ships passed. Those were tense moments. Had the green back of  our ship been observed, we would have been disintegrated in a second.  But it wasn't.    Once over the water, however, we climbed in a great spiral, ten miles in  diameter, until our altimeter registered ten miles. Here Gibbons shut  off his rocket motor, and we floated, far above the level of the  Atlantic liners, whose course was well to the north of us anyhow, and  waited for nightfall.    Then Gibbons turned from his control long enough to grin at me.    \"I have a surprise for you, Tony,\" he said, throwing back the lid of  what I had supposed was a big supply case. And with a sigh of relief,  Wilma stepped out of the case.    \"If you 'go into zero' (a common expression of the day for being  annihilated by the disintegrator ray), you don't think I'm going to let  you go alone, do you, Tony? I couldn't believe my ears last night when  you spoke of going without me, until I realized that you are still five  hundred years behind the times in lots of ways. Don't you know, dear  heart, that you offered me the greatest insult a husband could give a  wife? You didn't, of course.\"    The others, it seemed, had all been in on the secret, and now they would  have kidded me unmercifully, except that Wilma's eyes blazed  dangerously.    At nightfall, we maneuvered to a position directly above the city. This  took some time and calculation on the part of Bill Barker, who explained  to me that he had to determine our point by ultronic bearings. The  slightest resort to an electronic instrument, he feared, might be  detected by our enemies' locators. In fact, we did not dare bring our  swooper any lower than five miles for fear that its capacity might be  reflected in their instruments.    Finally, however, he succeeded in locating above the central tower of  the city.    \"If my calculations are as much as ten feet off,\" he remarked with  confidence, \"I'll eat the tower. Now the rest is up to you, Mort. See  what you can do to hold her steady. No--here, watch this indicator--the  red beam, not the green one. See--if you keep it exactly centered on the  needle, you're O.K. The width of the beam represents seventeen feet. The  tower platform is fifty feet square, so we've got a good margin to work  on.\"    For several moments we watched as Gibbons bent over his levers,  constantly adjusting them with deft touches of his fingers. After a bit  of wavering, the beam remained centered on the needle.    \"Now,\" I said, \"let's drop.\"    I opened the trap and looked down, but quickly shut it again when I felt  the air rushing out of the ship into the rarefied atmosphere in a  torrent. Gibbons literally yelled a protest from his instrument board.    \"I forgot,\" I mumbled. \"Silly of me. Of course, we'll have to drop out  of compartment.\"    The compartment, to which I referred, was similar to those in some of  the 20th Century submarines. We all entered it. There was barely room  for us to stand, shoulder to shoulder. With some struggles, we got into  our special air helmets and adjusted the pressure. At our signal,  Gibbons exhausted the air in the compartment, pumping it into the body  of the ship, and as the little signal light flashed, Wilma threw open  the hatch.    Setting the ultron-wire reel, I climbed through, and began to slide down  gently.    We all had our belts on, of course, adjusted to a weight balance of but  a few ounces. And the five-mile reel of ultron wire that was to be our  guide, was of gossamer fineness, though, anyway, I believe it would have  lifted the full weight of the five of us, so strong and tough was this  invisible metal.

He said, \"Yes, we will go into the house in a minute.  My kinsman  is too old to do much work in the Museum, where he was a custodian of the  books for many years; but he still lives here a good deal; indeed I  think,\" said he, smiling, \"that he looks upon himself as a part of the  books, or the books a part of him, I don't know which.\"    He hesitated a little longer, then flushing up, took my hand, and saying,  \"Come along, then!\" led me toward the door of one of the old official  dwellings.          CHAPTER IX: CONCERNING LOVE      \"Your kinsman doesn't much care for beautiful building, then,\" said I, as  we entered the rather dreary classical house; which indeed was as bare as  need be, except for some big pots of the June flowers which stood about  here and there; though it was very clean and nicely whitewashed.    \"O I don't know,\" said Dick, rather absently.  \"He is getting old,  certainly, for he is over a hundred and five, and no doubt he doesn't  care about moving.  But of course he could live in a prettier house if he  liked: he is not obliged to live in one place any more than any one else.  This way, Guest.\"    And he led the way upstairs, and opening a door we went into a fair-sized  room of the old type, as plain as the rest of the house, with a few  necessary pieces of furniture, and those very simple and even rude, but  solid and with a good deal of carving about them, well designed but  rather crudely executed.  At the furthest corner of the room, at a desk  near the window, sat a little old man in a roomy oak chair, well  becushioned.  He was dressed in a sort of Norfolk jacket of blue serge  worn threadbare, with breeches of the same, and grey worsted stockings.  He jumped up from his chair, and cried out in a voice of considerable  volume for such an old man, \"Welcome, Dick, my lad; Clara is here, and  will be more than glad to see you; so keep your heart up.\"    \"Clara here?\" quoth Dick; \"if I had known, I would not have brought--At  least, I mean I would--\"    He was stuttering and confused, clearly because he was anxious to say  nothing to make me feel one too many.  But the old man, who had not seen  me at first, helped him out by coming forward and saying to me in a kind  tone:    \"Pray pardon me, for I did not notice that Dick, who is big enough to  hide anybody, you know, had brought a friend with him.  A most hearty  welcome to you!  All the more, as I almost hope that you are going to  amuse an old man by giving him news from over sea, for I can see that you  are come from over the water and far off countries.\"    He looked at me thoughtfully, almost anxiously, as he said in a changed  voice, \"Might I ask you where you come from, as you are so clearly a  stranger?\"    I said in an absent way: \"I used to live in England, and now I am come  back again; and I slept last night at the Hammersmith Guest House.\"    He bowed gravely, but seemed, I thought, a little disappointed with my  answer.  As for me, I was now looking at him harder than good manners  allowed of; perhaps; for in truth his face, dried-apple-like as it was,  seemed strangely familiar to me; as if I had seen it before--in a looking-  glass it might be, said I to myself.    \"Well,\" said the old man, \"wherever you come from, you are come among  friends.  And I see my kinsman Richard Hammond has an air about him as if  he had brought you here for me to do something for you.  Is that so,  Dick?\"    Dick, who was getting still more absent-minded and kept looking uneasily  at the door, managed to say, \"Well, yes, kinsman: our guest finds things  much altered, and cannot understand it; nor can I; so I thought I would  bring him to you, since you know more of all that has happened within the  last two hundred years than any body else does.--What's that?\"    And he turned toward the door again.  We heard footsteps outside; the  door opened, and in came a very beautiful young woman, who stopped short  on seeing Dick, and flushed as red as a rose, but faced him nevertheless.  Dick looked at her hard, and half reached out his hand toward her, and  his whole face quivered with emotion.    The old man did not leave them long in this shy discomfort, but said,  smiling with an old man's mirth:    \"Dick, my lad, and you, my dear Clara, I rather think that we two  oldsters are in your way; for I think you will have plenty to say to each  other.  You had better go into Nelson's room up above; I know he has gone  out; and he has just been covering the walls all over with mediaeval  books, so it will be pretty enough even for you two and your renewed  pleasure.\"    The girl reached out her hand to Dick, and taking his led him out of the  room, looking straight before her; but it was easy to see that her  blushes came from happiness, not anger; as, indeed, love is far more self-  conscious than wrath.    When the door had shut on them the old man turned to me, still smiling,  and said:    \"Frankly, my dear guest, you will do me a great service if you are come  to set my old tongue wagging.  My love of talk still abides with me, or  rather grows on me; and though it is pleasant enough to see these  youngsters moving about and playing together so seriously, as if the  whole world depended on their kisses (as indeed it does somewhat), yet I  don't think my tales of the past interest them much.  The last harvest,  the last baby, the last knot of carving in the market-place, is history  enough for them.  It was different, I think, when I was a lad, when we  were not so assured of peace and continuous plenty as we are now--Well,  well!  Without putting you to the question, let me ask you this: Am I to  consider you as an enquirer who knows a little of our modern ways of  life, or as one who comes from some place where the very foundations of  life are different from ours,--do you know anything or nothing about us?\"    He looked at me keenly and with growing wonder in his eyes as he spoke;  and I answered in a low voice:    \"I know only so much of your modern life as I could gather from using my  eyes on the way here from Hammersmith, and from asking some questions of  Richard Hammond, most of which he could hardly understand.\"    The old man smiled at this.  \"Then,\" said he, \"I am to speak to you as--\"    \"As if I were a being from another planet,\" said I.    The old man, whose name, by the bye, like his kinsman's, was Hammond,  smiled and nodded, and wheeling his seat round to me, bade me sit in a  heavy oak chair, and said, as he saw my eyes fix on its curious carving:    \"Yes, I am much tied to the past, my past, you understand.  These very  pieces of furniture belong to a time before my early days; it was my  father who got them made; if they had been done within the last fifty  years they would have been much cleverer in execution; but I don't think  I should have liked them the better.  We were almost beginning again in  those days: and they were brisk, hot-headed times.  But you hear how  garrulous I am: ask me questions, ask me questions about anything, dear  guest; since I must talk, make my talk profitable to you.\"    I was silent for a minute, and then I said, somewhat nervously: \"Excuse  me if I am rude; but I am so much interested in Richard, since he has  been so kind to me, a perfect stranger, that I should like to ask a  question about him.\"    \"Well,\" said old Hammond, \"if he were not 'kind', as you call it, to a  perfect stranger he would be thought a strange person, and people would  be apt to shun him.  But ask on, ask on! don't be shy of asking.\"    Said I: \"That beautiful girl, is he going to be married to her?\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"yes, he is.  He has been married to her once already,  and now I should say it is pretty clear that he will be married to her  again.\"    \"Indeed,\" quoth I, wondering what that meant.    \"Here is the whole tale,\" said old Hammond; \"a short one enough; and now  I hope a happy one: they lived together two years the first time; were  both very young; and then she got it into her head that she was in love  with somebody else.  So she left poor Dick; I say _poor_ Dick, because he  had not found any one else.  But it did not last long, only about a year.  Then she came to me, as she was in the habit of bringing her troubles to  the old carle, and asked me how Dick was, and whether he was happy, and  all the rest of it.  So I saw how the land lay, and said that he was very  unhappy, and not at all well; which last at any rate was a lie.  There,  you can guess the rest.  Clara came to have a long talk with me to-day,  but Dick will serve her turn much better.  Indeed, if he hadn't chanced  in upon me to-day I should have had to have sent for him to-morrow.\"    \"Dear me,\" said I.  \"Have they any children?\"    \"Yes,\" said he, \"two; they are staying with one of my daughters at  present, where, indeed, Clara has mostly been.  I wouldn't lose sight of  her, as I felt sure they would come together again: and Dick, who is the  best of good fellows, really took the matter to heart.  You see, he had  no other love to run to, as she had.  So I managed it all; as I have done  with such-like matters before.\"    \"Ah,\" said I, \"no doubt you wanted to keep them out of the Divorce Court:  but I suppose it often has to settle such matters.\"    \"Then you suppose nonsense,\" said he.  \"I know that there used to be such  lunatic affairs as divorce-courts: but just consider; all the cases that  came into them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear  guest,\" said he, smiling, \"that though you do come from another planet,  you can see from the mere outside look of our world that quarrels about  private property could not go on amongst us in our days.\"    Indeed, my drive from Hammersmith to Bloomsbury, and all the quiet happy  life I had seen so many hints of; even apart from my shopping, would have  been enough to "]]]
