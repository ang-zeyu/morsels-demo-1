But as these habitations were intended by Governor Phillip to answer  only the exigency of the moment, the plan of the town was drawn, and the  ground on which it is hereafter to stand surveyed, and marked out.  To proceed on a narrow, confined scale, in a country of the extensive  limits we possess, would be unpardonable: extent of empire demands  grandeur of design. That this has been our view will be readily  believed, when I tell the reader, that the principal street in our  projected city will be, when completed, agreeable to the plan laid  down, two hundred feet in breadth, and all the rest of a corresponding  proportion. How far this will be accompanied with adequate dispatch, is  another question, as the incredulous among us are sometimes hardy enough  to declare, that ten times our strength would not be able to finish it  in as many years.    Invariably intent on exploring a country, from which curiosity promises  so many gratifications, his Excellency about this time undertook an  expedition into the interior parts of the continent. His party consisted  of eleven persons, who, after being conveyed by water to the head of  the harbour, proceeded in a westerly direction, to reach a chain of  mountains, which in clear weather are discernible, though at an immense  distance, from some heights near our encampment. With unwearied industry  they continued to penetrate the country for four days; but at the end of  that time, finding the base of the mountain to be yet at the distance  of more than twenty miles, and provisions growing scarce, it was judged  prudent to return, without having accomplished the end for which the  expedition had been undertaken. To reward their toils, our adventurers  had, however, the pleasure of discovering and traversing an extensive  tract of ground, which they had reason to believe, from the observations  they were enabled to make, capable of producing every thing, which  a happy soil and genial climate can bring forth. In addition to this  flattering appearance, the face of the country is such, as to  promise success whenever it shall be cultivated, the trees being at  a considerable distance from each other, and the intermediate space  filled, not with underwood, but a thick rich grass, growing in the  utmost luxuriancy. I must not, however, conceal, that in this long  march, our gentlemen found not a single rivulet, but were under a  necessity of supplying themselves with water from standing pools, which  they met with in the vallies, supposed to be formed by the rains that  fall at particular seasons of the year. Nor had they the good fortune to  see any quadrupeds worth notice, except a few kangaroos. To their great  surprize, they observed indisputable tracks of the natives having been  lately there, though in their whole route none of them were to be seen;  nor any means to be traced, by which they could procure subsistence so  far from the sea shore.    On the 6th of May the 'Supply' sailed for Lord Howe Island, to take on  board turtle for the settlement; but after waiting there several days  was obliged to return without having seen one, owing we apprehended to  the advanced season of the year. Three of the transports also, which  were engaged by the East India Company to proceed to China, to take on  board a lading of tea, sailed about this time for Canton.    The unsuccessful return of the 'Supply' cast a general damp on our  spirits, for by this time fresh provisions were become scarcer than in  a blockaded town. The little live stock, which with so heavy an expense,  and through so many difficulties, we had brought on shore, prudence  forbade us to use; and fish, which on our arrival, and for a short time  after had been tolerable plenty, were become so scarce, as to be rarely  seen at the tables of the first among us. Had it not been for a stray  kangaroo, which fortune now and then threw in our way, we should have  been utter strangers to the taste of fresh food.    Thus situated, the scurvy began its usual ravages, and extended its  baneful influence, more or less, through all descriptions of persons.  Unfortunately the esculent vegetable productions of the country are  neither plentiful, nor tend very effectually to remove this disease.  And, the ground we had turned up and planted with garden seeds, either  from the nature of the soil, or, which is more probable, the lateness  of the season, yielded but a scanty and insufficient supply of what we  stood so greatly in need of.    During the period I am describing, few enormous offences were  perpetrated by the convicts. A petty theft was now and then heard  of, and a spirit of refractory sullenness broke out at times in some  individuals: one execution only, however, took place. The sufferer, who  was a very young man, was convicted of a burglary, and met his fate with  a hardiness and insensibility, which the grossest ignorance, and most  deplorable want of feeling, alone could supply.          CHAPTER XIV.        From the Beginning of June, to the Departure of the Ships for Europe.      Hours of festivity, which under happier skies pass away unregarded,  and are soon consigned to oblivion, acquire in this forlorn and distant  circle a superior degree of acceptable importance.    On the anniversary of the King's birthday all the officers not on duty,  both of the garrison and his Majesty's ships, dined with the Governor.  On so joyful an occasion, the first too ever celebrated in our new  settlement, it were needless to say, that loyal conviviality dictated  every sentiment, and inspired every guest. Among other public toasts  drank, was, Prosperity to Sydney Cove, in Cumberland county, now named  so by authority. At day-light in the morning the ships of war had fired  twenty-one guns each, which was repeated at noon, and answered by three  vollies from the battalion of marines.    Nor were the officers alone partakers of the general relaxation. The  four unhappy wretches labouring under sentence of banishment were freed  from their fetters, to rejoin their former society; and three days given  as holidays to every convict in the colony. Hospitality too, which ever  acquires a double relish by being extended, was not forgotten on the 4th  of June, when each prisoner, male and female, received an allowance of  grog; and every non-commissioned officer and private soldier had the  honor of drinking prosperity to his royal master, in a pint of porter,  served out at the flag staff, in addition to the customary allowance  of spirits. Bonfires concluded the evening, and I am happy to say, that  excepting a single instance which shall be taken notice of hereafter, no  bad consequence, or unpleasant remembrance, flowed from an indulgence so  amply bestowed.    About this time (June) an accident happened, which I record with much  regret. The whole of our black cattle, consisting of five cows and a  bull, either from not being properly secured, or from the negligence  of those appointed to take care of them, strayed into the woods, and in  spite of all the search we have been able to make, are not yet found.  As a convict of the name of Corbet, who was accused of a theft, eloped  nearly at the same time, it was at first believed, that he had taken the  desperate measure of driving off the cattle, in order to subsist on them  as long as possible; or perhaps to deliver them to the natives. In this  uncertainty, parties to search were sent out in different directions;  and the fugitive declared an outlaw, in case of not returning by a fixed  day. After much anxiety and fatigue, those who had undertaken the task  returned without finding the cattle. But on the 21st of the month,  Corbet made his appearance near a farm belonging to the Governor, and  entreated a convict, who happened to be on the spot, to give him some  food, as he was perishing for hunger. The man applied to, under pretence  of fetching what he asked for, went away and immediately gave the  necessary information, in consequence of which a party under arms was  sent out and apprehended him. When the poor wretch was brought in, he  was greatly emaciated and almost famished. But on proper restoratives  being administered, he was so far recovered by the 24th, as to be able  to stand his trial, when he pleaded Guilty to the robbery with which he  stood charged, and received sentence of death. In the course of repeated  examinations it plainly appeared, he was an utter stranger to the place  where the cattle might be, and was in no shape concerned in having  driven them off.    Samuel Peyton, convict, for having on the evening of the King's  birth-day broke open an officer's marquee, with an intent to commit  robbery, of which he was fully convicted, had sentence of death passed  on him at the same time as Corbet; and on the following day they were  both executed, confessing the justness of their fate, and imploring the  forgiveness of those whom they had injured. Peyton, at the time of his  suffering, was but twenty years of age, the greatest part of which  had been invariably passed in the commission of crimes, that at length  terminated in his ignominious end. The following letter, written by a  fellow convict to the sufferer's unhappy mother, I shall make no apology  for presenting to the reader; it affords a melancholy proof, that  not the ignorant and untaught only have provoked the justice of their  country to banish them to this remote region.      Sydney Cove, Port Jackson,    New South Wales, 24th June, 1788.    \"My dear and honoured mother!    \"With a heart oppressed by the keenest sense of anguish, and too much  agitated by the idea of my very melancholy condition, to express my own  sentiments, I have prevailed on the goodness of a commiserating friend,  to do me the last sad office of acquainting you with the dreadful fate  that awaits me.    \"My dear mother! with what agony of soul do I dedicate the few "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#11)"],[1,"detective may not only find out about the purse and the silver, but  detect some crime that isn't even done yet. And I shall hang about  until I see some suspicious-looking characters leave the town, and  follow them furtively and catch them red-handed, with their hands  full of priceless jewels, and hand them over.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Mabel, so sharply and suddenly that Gerald was roused  from his dream to express sympathy.    \"Pain?\" he said quite kindly. \"It's the apples they were rather hard.\"    \"Oh, it's not that,\" said Mabel very earnestly. \"Oh, how awful! I  never thought of that before.\"    \"Never thought of what?\" Gerald asked impatiently.    \"The window.\"    \"What window?\"    \"The panelled-room window. At home, you know at the castle.  That settles it I must go home. We left it open and the shutters as  well, and all the jewels and things there. Auntie'll never go in; she  never does. That settles it; I must go home now this minute.\"    Here the others issued from the shop, bun-bearing, and the  situation was hastily explained to them.    \"So you see I must go,\" Mabel ended.    And Kathleen agreed that she must.    But Jimmy said he didn't see what good it would do. \"Because the  key's inside the door, anyhow.\"    \"She will be cross,\" said Mabel sadly. \"She'll have to get the  gardeners to get a ladder and \"    \"Hooray!\" said Gerald. \"Here's me! Nobler and more secret than  gardeners or ladders was the invisible Jerry. I'll climb in at the  window it's all ivy, I know I could and shut the window and the  shutters all sereno, put the key back on the nail, and slip out  unperceived the back way, threading my way through the maze of  unconscious retainers. There'll be plenty of time. I don't suppose  burglars begin their fell work until the night is far advanced.\"    \"Won't you be afraid?\" Mabel asked. \"Will it be safe  suppose you  were caught?\"    \"As houses. I can't be,\" Gerald answered, and wondered that the  question came from Mabel and not from Kathleen, who was  usually inclined to fuss a little annoyingly about the danger and  folly of adventures.    But all Kathleen said was, \"Well, good-bye; we'll come and see  you tomorrow, Mabel. The floral temple at half-past ten. I hope  you won't get into an awful row about the motor-car lady.\"    \"Let's detect our supper now,\" said Jimmy.    \"All right,\" said Gerald a little bitterly. It is hard to enter on an  adventure like this and to find the sympathetic interest of years  suddenly cut off at the meter, as it were. Gerald felt that he ought,  at a time like this, to have been the centre of interest. And he  wasn't. They could actually talk about supper. Well, let them. He  didn't care! He spoke with sharp sternness: \"Leave the pantry  window undone for me to get in by when I've done my detecting.  Come on, Mabel.\" He caught her hand. \"Bags I the buns, though,\"  he added, by a happy afterthought, and snatching the bag, pressed  it on Mabel, and the sound of four boots echoed on the pavement  of the High Street as the outlines of the running Mabel grew small  with distance.    Mademoiselle was in the drawing-room. She was sitting by the  window in the waning light reading letters.    \"Ah, vous voici!\" she said unintelligibly. \"You are again late; and  my little Gerald, where is he?\"    This was an awful moment. Jimmy's detective scheme had not  included any answer to this inevitable question. The silence was  unbroken till Jimmy spoke.    \"He said he was going to bed because he had a headache.\" And  this, of course, was true.    \"This poor Gerald!\" said Mademoiselle. \"Is it that I should mount  him some supper?\"    \"He never eats anything when he's got one of his headaches,\"  Kathleen said. And this also was the truth.    Jimmy and Kathleen Went to bed, wholly untroubled by anxiety  about their brother, and Mademoiselle pulled out the bundle of  letters and read them amid the ruins of the simple supper.    \"It is ripping being out late like this,\" said Gerald through the soft  summer dusk.    \"Yes,\" said Mabel, a solitary-looking figure plodding along the  high-road. \"I do hope auntie won't be very furious.\"    \"Have another bun,\" suggested Gerald kindly, and a sociable  munching followed.    It was the aunt herself who opened to a very pale and trembling  Mabel the door which is appointed for the entrances and exits of  the domestic staff at Yalding Towers. She looked over Mabel's  head first, as if she expected to see someone taller. Then a very  small voice said:    \"Aunt!\"    The aunt started back, then made a step towards Mabel.    \"You naughty, naughty girl!\" she cried angrily; \"how could you  give me such a fright? I've a good mind to keep you in bed for a  week for this, miss. Oh, Mabel, thank Heaven you're safe!\" And  with that the aunt's arms went round Mabel and Mabel's round the  aunt in such a hug as they had never met in before.    \"But you didn't seem to care a bit this morning,\" said Mabel, when  she had realized that her aunt really had been anxious, really was  glad to have her safe home again.    \"How do you know?\"    \"I was there listening. Don't be angry, auntie.\"    \"I feel as if I could never be angry with you again, now I've got you  safe,\" said the aunt surprisingly.    \"But how was it?\" Mabel asked.    \"My dear,\" said the aunt impressively, \"I've been in a sort of  trance. I think I must be going to be ill. I've always been fond of  you, but I didn't want to spoil you. But yesterday, about half-past  three, I was talking about you to Mr. Lewson, at the fair, and quite  suddenly I felt as if you didn't matter at all. And I felt the same  when I got your letter and when those children came. And today in  the middle of tea I suddenly woke up and realized that you were  gone. It was awful. I think I must be going to be ill. Oh, Mabel,  why did you do it?\"    \"It was a joke,\" said Mabel feebly. And then the two went in and  the door was shut.    \"That's most uncommon odd,\" said Gerald, outside; \"looks like  more magic to me. I don't feel as if we d got to the bottom of this  yet, by any manner of means. There's more about this castle than  meets the eye.\"    There certainly was. For this castle happened to be  but it would  not be fair to Gerald to tell you more about it than he knew on that  night when he went alone and invisible through the shadowy great  grounds of it to look for the open window of the panelled room.  He knew that night no more than I have told you; but as he went  along the dewy lawns and through the groups of shrubs and trees,  where pools lay like giant looking-glasses reflecting the quiet stars,  and the white limbs of statues gleamed against a background of  shadow, he began to feel well, not excited, not surprised, not  anxious, but different.    The incident of the invisible Princess had surprised, the incident of  the conjuring had excited, and the sudden decision to be a  detective had brought its own anxieties; but all these happenings,  though wonderful and unusual, had seemed to be, after all, inside  the circle of possible things wonderful as the chemical  experiments are where two liquids poured together make fire,  surprising as legerdemain, thrilling as a juggler's display, but  nothing more. Only now a new feeling came to him as he walked  through those gardens; by day those gardens were like dreams, at  night they were like visions. He could not see his feet as he  walked, but he saw the movement of the dewy grass-blades that his  feet displaced. And he had that extraordinary feeling so difficult to  describe, and yet so real and so unforgettable the feeling that he  was in another world, that had covered up and hidden the old  world as a carpet covers a floor. The floor was there all right,  underneath, but what he walked on was the carpet that covered it  and that carpet was drenched in magic, as the turf was drenched in  dew.    The feeling was very wonderful; perhaps you will feel it some day.  There are still some places in the world where it can be felt, but  they grow fewer every year.    The enchantment of the garden held him.    \"I'll not go in yet,\" he told himself; \"it's too early. And perhaps I  shall never be here at night again. I suppose it is the night that  makes everything look so different.\"    Something white moved under a weeping willow; white hands  parted the long, rustling leaves. A white figure came out, a  creature with horns and goat's legs and the head and arms of a boy.  And Gerald was not afraid. That was the most wonderful thing of  all, though he would never have owned it. The white thing  stretched its limbs, rolled on the grass, righted itself and frisked  away across the lawn. Still something white gleamed under the  willow; three steps nearer and Gerald saw that it was the pedestal  of a statue empty.    \"They come alive,\" he said; and another white shape came out of  the Temple of Flora and disappeared in the laurels. \"The statues  come alive.\"    There was a crunching of the little stones in the gravel of the drive.  Something enormously long and darkly grey came crawling  towards him, slowly, heavily. The moon came out just in time to  show its shape. It was one of those great lizards that you see at the  Crystal Palace, made in stone, of the same awful size which they  were millions of years ago when they were masters of the world,  before Man was.    \"It can't see me,\" said Gerald. \"I am not afraid. It's come to life,  too.\"    As it writhed past him he reached out a hand and touched the side  of its gigantic tail. It was of stone. It had not \"come alive\" as he  had fancied, but was alive in its stone. It turned, however, at the  touch; but Gerald also had turned, and was running with all his  speed towards the house. Because at that stony touch Fear had  come into the garden and almost caught him. It was Fear that he  ran from, and not the moving stone beast.    He stood panting under the fifth window; when he had climbed to  the window-ledge by"]]]
