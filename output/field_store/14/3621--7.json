Authors and Books.      We have already briefly spoken of Dr. ANDREE'S work on America which is  now publishing at Brunswick, Germany, by the house of Westermann, a  branch of which is established in this city at the corner of Broadway  and Duane-streets. The book in question is to consist of three volumes  of some six hundred and fifty octavo pages each, devoted respectively to  North, Central, and South America. It is published in numbers of some  eighty pages each; of these numbers four are already issued, and we have  read them with great satisfaction. The broad and philosophical spirit,  the exhaustive learning, and the spirited and picturesque style of Dr.  Andree are beyond praise; among all the books on America which we have  met with this impresses us as unique, and if the remainder shall prove  equal to what is already published, we hope that some American publisher  may undertake a translation of the whole into English.    The work opens with an introduction of some forty odd pages, in which,  first, the physical characteristics of the new world are set forth with  great clearness and beauty: its mountains, rivers, lakes, climate,  vegetable and animal kingdoms; the origin of the aboriginal inhabitants,  their languages, races, manners, customs, and civilization; the  settlements of Europeans, the Spaniards, the Spanish and Portuguese  states, the Creoles, Mexico, Brazil, &c. Amalgamation of races, the  negroes, Slavery, influence of the Latin races, the Teutonic race, the  United States, their growth and destiny, are made the subjects of a  continuous discussion, remarkable alike for an air at least of breadth  and profundity, careful and comprehensive knowledge, and for concise and  often eloquent expression. The introduction is followed by chapters on  Iceland, Greenland, and the various expeditions to the polar regions of  the north, treating those topics both historically and ethnographically,  and with a clear presentation of every interesting and important fact.  Next follows a general survey of the continent north of the fiftieth,  degree of latitude, its rivers, lakes, forests, animals, men, and  commerce, including an account of the various Indian tribes, and the  trading companies dealing with them. The trading posts of the Hudson's  Bay Company, Lord Selkirk's colony on Red River, Labrador, Newfoundland,  the British Possessions on the West coast, Russian America, are  successively treated. Next the Indians in Canada and the United States  are considered at length, in respect of their history, traditions,  languages, monuments, customs, the influence of the whites upon them,  and their probable destiny. In this connection we notice that Dr. Andree  frequently cites Gallatin, Schoolcraft, Squier, and other American  writers. The remainder of the first volume will treat of the United  States, their political history and organization, their soil, climate,  people, &c., not failing to give whatever information may be useful to  the European settler looking for a new home, as well as to the _savan_  looking for light upon ethnographic and social problems.    From this general outline the scope of the book may be inferred, but our  readers will permit us to refer to one or two points which are dwelt  upon in the introduction. Dr. Andree contends with the earnestness of a  determined partisan for the originality of the vegetable and animal  creations, as well as of the human race upon this continent, rejecting  entirely the theory that either was transplanted from the eastern  hemisphere. The unity of the human family, he maintains with a class of  writers distinguishable chiefly for a sleepless activity in assailing  the authority of the Christian religion, does not require the assumption  of numerical identity of origin, but rather the contrary. \"It is not  necessary,\" he says, \"to assume the arithmetical _oneness_ of mankind,  and the derivation of all from a single pair, thus arbitrarily confining  and limiting the creative power of the Highest Being;\" and this position  he proceeds to advocate by a variety of arguments, at the same time  controverting the opposite opinion, and especially the notion of the  late Major Noah that the Indians of this continent were descendants of  the lost ten tribes of Israel. In this impertinence is the only  noteworthy fault we discover in the book. Discussions of such  controverted points as this belong exclusively to the audience of  scholars. A far more interesting and satisfactory part of the  introduction is that devoted to the Spanish and Portuguese in America,  and their influence on the native tribes, and _vice versa_. The contrast  which these races and the states they have founded exhibit to the  Germanic race in North America is brought out by Dr. Andree in a  striking manner. All the South American republics except Chili are in a  condition of comparative or actual disorder: no signs of expanding life  and progress are visible among them; every where the conflict of races  and castes is active or only partially suppressed; Brazil alone, by the  monarchical form of its executive, (though its institutions are  fundamentally democratic,) is spared from the anarchy which prevails  among its neighbors, and there too, alone, the black, yellow, and red  races are politically equal and in the way of complete amalgamation; but  in all these states the European element, instead of growing more  powerful and influential, tends constantly to greater weakness, and is  likely to be completely absorbed and swallowed up; since the wars of  independence the white race has diminished, not increased in number; and  instead of conferring on the native races the civilization and  refinement which was its native property, it is so far dominated by them  as to relapse toward their ignorance and rudeness; and after three  centuries all Spanish America, the West Indies included, contains not  more than fifteen millions of inhabitants, about a fifth of whom are  whites, that is to say as many as are found in the State of New-York  alone. Or, reckoning for all America south of the United States, five  millions of whites, this population still falls far short of that which  within thirty years has taken possession of the country between the  Alleghanies and the Mississippi. Such is the difference between the  Latin and the Saxon races. The latter has spread itself with astonishing  rapidity, never mixing, to any extent, with negroes or Indians, nor  allowing mixed races to get the upper hand, or even exercise any  influence. The Anglo-Saxon civilizes the other races or devotes them to  extinction. And yet South America is naturally better than North. It is  richer and more productive, and endowed with a system of rivers compared  with which that of the Mississippi seems trifling. Had it been settled  by Anglo-Saxons and Germans instead of Creoles and mixed breeds, it  would long since have worn another aspect; steamboats would have covered  the rivers up to the very foot of the Cordilleras, and the vast plains  would have been occupied by flourishing towns and cultivated fields.    The parallel which Dr. Andree draws between the history of the United  States and Europe for the last fifty years is so strikingly put, that we  make room for a single passage by way of specimen:         \"A comparison of the history of Europe and of North America       during the time since the first French revolution is in every       respect to the advantage of the United States. The old world       has been convulsed by wars, a military emperor has had the sway       of Europe, and broken kingdoms into fragments; blood has flowed       in torrents, and thousands of millions have been wasted for       unproductive purposes and on royal vanity. Since the fall of       the Great Soldier the nations have incessantly risen against       their rulers, and more than a million of men now stand in arms       to restrain the people and serve the passions of monarchs and       their cabinets. Only sixty years ago the entire valley of the       Mississippi was still a desert, a wide wilderness, with hardly       here and there a settlement. Now we see this empire in       subjection--conquered, not by soldiers, with waving banners and       sounding trumpets, but by the toil of the farmer, the skill of       the artisan, the enterprising spirit of the merchant. They have       drained morasses, cleared up forests, opened roads, dug canals,       built ships, and founded flourishing states. Within the period       of two generations they have peopled that wilderness with ten       millions of industrious inhabitants, and opened a new home to       the arts of peace, to civil and religious liberty, to culture       and progress. In these sixty years, not so much blood has been       shed in wars against Indians in the Mississippi valley as in       one of the hundreds of battles fought by the soldiers of       European states, most of them for useless or even pernicious       ends. No blessing has followed the wars and conquests in       Europe, but in the Great West, conquered by labor and       enterprise, all is progress and unexampled prosperity.\"    There are numerous other passages tempting us to translate them, but  our space is already exhausted, and we forbear.           *       *       *       *       *    We have already taken occasion to commend the _Tausend und ein Tag im  Orient_ (Thousand and One Days in the East) by BODENSTEDT, the  well-known author of the Wars of the Circassians.

This, however, was speedily rectified. Their  behavior was much the same as at Louvain and Brussels. They marched in  with bands playing and singing patriotic songs. Proclamations were at  once issued warning the citizens not to commit any hostile act. The  inhabitants were far too cowed to contemplate anything but submission.  Good discipline was preserved. The city took fire that night probably by  deliberate design of the invaders. The citizens were induced to come  forth from their cellars and hiding places to reopen the cafes and  shops.    General von Buelow entered Namur on Monday morning August 24, 1914. He  was accompanied by Field Marshal Baron von der Goltz, recently appointed  Governor General of Belgium. Previous to the former Balkan War he had  been employed in reorganizing the Turkish army. An onlooker in Namur  thus describes the German Field Marshal:--\"An elderly gentleman covered  with orders, buttoned in an overcoat up to his nose, above which gleamed  a pair of enormous spectacles.\"    General Michel attributed his defeat to the German siege guns. The fire  was so continuous upon the trenches that it was impossible to hold them,  and the forts simply crumpled under the storm of shells. But back of  General Michel's plea the allied Intelligence Departments lacked  efficiency or energy, or both, in not gaining more than a hint, at any  rate, of the enormous German siege guns until they were actually  thundering at the gates.          CHAPTER VIII    BATTLE OF CHARLEROI      Toward the end of the third week of August, 1914, the atmosphere of  every European capital became tense with the realization that a  momentous crisis was impending. It was known that the French-British  armies confronted German armies of equal, if not of superior strength.  In Paris and London the military critics wrote optimistically that the  Germans were marching into a trap.    The British army had arrived at the front in splendid fighting trim. It  was difficult to restrain the impetuous valor of the French soldiers.  The skies were bright and there was confidence that the Germans would  unquestionably meet with a crushing defeat. Let us glance at the line of  the French and British armies stretched along the Belgian frontier. It  ran from within touch of Namur up the right bank of the Sambre, through  Charleroi to Binche and Mons, thence by way of the coal barge canal just  within the French frontier to Conde. For the choice of a great battle  ground there was nothing particularly attractive about it in a military  sense.    There is evidence to show in an official communique from General Joffre  published on August 24, 1914, that it was intended to be merely the left  wing of a gigantic French battle offensive--on the adopted German  plan--from Conde to Belfort. \"An army,\" runs the communique, \"advancing  from the northern part of the Woevre and moving on Neufchateau is  attacking the German forces which have been going through the Duchy of  Luxemburg and are on the right bank of the Samoy. Another army from the  region of Sedan is traversing the Belgian Ardennes and attacking the  German forces marching between the Lesse and the Meuse. A third army  from the region of Chimay has attacked the German right between the  Sambre and the Meuse. It is supported by the English army from the  region of Mons.\"    These attacks comprised chiefly the battle of Dinant and cavalry  skirmishing, but the purpose of General Joffre was otherwise made plain  in throwing advance French troops across the Belgian frontier into Ligny  and Gembloux on the road to a recapture of Brussels. This we have  previously noted in another connection. The rout of the French army in  Lorraine, however, put an end to the grand Conde-Belfort offensive.    Thus the Namur-Conde line became a main defensive position instead of an  offensive left wing sweep through Belgium upon Germany. As such it was  well enough--if its pivot on the fortress of Namur held secure. Liege  had already proved its vulnerability, but it would seem that the French  General Staff joined with General Michel, the Commander of Namur, in  believing the Namur forts would give a better account. The French  General Staff were informed of the approximate strength of the advancing  armies of Von Kluck and Von Buelow, and had nothing to fear from  inferiority in numbers. The staff never gave out the strength of their  forces, but there is reason for believing the great armies were nearly  equally matched after mobilization--about 1,200,000 men.    Let us now see what was developing in the Ardennes away to the French  right. It has been established that woods, particularly in summer, form  the best cover from the observation or attacks of airmen. The spreading,  leafy boughs are difficult to penetrate visually from a height of even a  few hundred feet, at least to obtain accurate information of what is  transpiring beneath.    French air scouts brought in correct information that they had seen the  armies of the Duke of Wuerttemberg and crown prince massed along the  southern Luxemburg and Belgian forest region. But under the foliage  there was another army unseen--that of General von Hausen. The French  moved their Fifth Army up to position on the line of the Sambre. They  advanced their Third Army, commanded by General Ruffey, upon Luxemburg,  and their Fourth Army under General de Langle de Cary across the River  Semois to watch the Meuse left bank and gain touch with General  Lanzerac. General de Cary came from Sedan, throwing out detachments  upon the Meuse left bank. These operations were to confront the armies  of the Duke of Wuerttemberg and crown prince.    But the French apparently knew nothing of the movements of the army of  General von Hausen. Their air scouts either could not distinguish it  from the armies of the Duke of Wuerttemberg and the crown prince, amid  the forest of the Ardennes, or they did not observe it at all. To the  army of General von Hausen there clings a good deal of mystery. When  last noted by us, previous to the minor battle of Dinant, it had been  formed by forces drawn from the armies of the Duke of Wuerttemberg and  crown prince. Ostensibly at that time, it was destined to support, as a  separate field force, the armies of Von Kluck and Von Buelow.    Possibly the Germans had begun to doubt how long Liege could hold out.  Von Kluck was compelled to mark time in his impetuous march on Central  Belgium. His losses had been heavy. Support in strength seemed urgent.  But this need passed as the Liege forts fell one after the other under  the fire of the German siege guns. General von Hausen was released for  action elsewhere. Thus we may assume, he was ordered to follow the  armies of the Duke of Wuerttemberg and crown prince down through the  Ardennes to strike the Meuse south of Namur. By this time he had been  substantially reenforced. Now under his command were the complete  Twelfth and Nineteenth Corps, and the Eleventh Reserve Corps. Also a  cavalry division of the Prussian Guard, with some other detachments of  cavalry. His Eleventh Reserve Corps were Hessians, the Twelfth and  Nineteenth Corps were Saxons. The latter two corps were regarded as  among the best in the German army. In the Franco-Prussian War they  fought with conspicuous bravery through every battle in which they were  engaged. They won the battle for Prussia at Gravelotte by turning the  French right and capturing St. Privat. They marched to Sedan under the  crown prince--subsequently the Emperor Frederick--to occupy the first  line in the hard fighting of the Givonne Valley. During the siege of  Paris they occupied a part of the German northern line, finally to march  in triumph into Paris. This infantry and cavalry of the Prussian Guard  stiffened Von Hausen's force into an army of battle strength.    We have thus two factors to bear in mind with regard to the French  defensive position at Charleroi--the resisting power of the Namur forts,  and the unknown, to the French, proximity of Von Hausen's army.    However substantial was the measure of reliance that the French General  Staff and General Michel placed on the Namur forts, evidently General  von Buelow regarded them as little more than passing targets for his  siege guns. He seemed to have made a comparatively simple mathematical  calculation of almost the number of shells necessary to fire, and the  hours to be consumed in reducing the Namur forts to masses of debris.    We can picture General von Buelow as he sat in the motor car with Marshal  von der Goltz--the old gentleman with an overcoat buttoned up to his  nose in August, and huge spectacles. Doubtless discussion ran mainly  upon the impending attack of their Second Army on the French right.  Emphasis would have been laid on the positions of the armies of the Duke  of Wuerttemberg and crown prince advancing away to their left upon the  forces of the French Generals Ruffey and de Cary. But there was  apparently a German gap here between Von Buelow's army and the armies of  the Duke of Wuerttemberg and crown prince, though we noticed previously  Von Buelow's army came in touch with Saxon troops half way between Huy  and Namur, when a detachment of Von Buelow's left wing was thrown across  the Meuse at Ardenne. This gap was faced by the French extreme right  resting on the southward Namur bend of the Meuse. It was possibly the  \"trap\" military critics of the moment foresaw for the Germans. Quite  likely the two German generals Von Buelow and Von der Goltz, chatting in  their motor car, referred to this gap, and it is hardly a stretch of  imagination to suggest a twinkle in the huge glasses of the old  gentleman in the August overcoat, when now and then the name of Von  Hausen was mentioned.    The German attack on the French right began early in the morning of  Friday, August 21, 1914. A party of German"]]]
