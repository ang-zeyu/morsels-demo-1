So an imperative necessity presents itself: there must  perforce be an initial larva form, capable of moving and organized for  searching, a form under which the grub would attain its end. The  Anthrax would thus possess two larval states: one to penetrate to the  provisions; the other to consume them. I allow myself to be convinced  by the logic of it all; I already see in my mind's eye the wee animal  coming out of the egg, endowed with sufficient power of motion not to  dread a walk and with sufficient slenderness to glide into the smallest  crevices. Once in the presence of the larva on which it is to feed, it  doffs its travelling dress and becomes the obese animal whose one duty  it is to grow big and fat in immobility. This is all very coherent;  it is all deduced like a geometrical proposition. But to the wings of  imagination, however smooth their flight, we must prefer the sandals  of observed facts, the slow sandals with the leaden soles. Thus shod, I  proceed.    Next year, I resume my investigations, this time on the Anthrax of the  Chalicodoma, who is my neighbor in the surrounding wastelands and will  allow me to repeat my visits daily, morning and evening if need be.  Taught by my earlier studies, I now know the exact period of the Bee's  hatching and therefore of the Anthrax' laying, which must take place  soon after. Anthrax trifasciata settles her family in July, or in August  at latest. Every morning, at nine o'clock, when the heat begins to  be unendurable and when, to use [the author's gardener and factotum]  Favier's expression, an extra log is flung on the bonfire of the sun,  I take the field, prepared to come back with my head aching from the  glare, provided that I bring home the solution of my puzzle. A man must  have the devil in him to leave the shade at this time of the year. And  what for, pray? To write the story of a fly! The greater the heat, the  better my chance of success. What causes me to suffer torture fills the  insect with delight; what prostrates me braces the fly. Come along!    The road shimmers like a sheet of molten steel. From the dusty and  melancholy olive trees rises a mighty, throbbing hum, a great andante  whose executants have the whole sweep of woods for their orchestra. 'Tis  the concert of the Cicada, whose bellies sway and rustle with increasing  frenzy as the temperature rises. The strident scrapings of the Cicada of  the Ash, the Carcan of the district, lend their rhythm to the one note  symphony of the common cicada. This is the moment: come along! And, for  five or six weeks, oftenest in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon,  I set myself to explore the flinty plateau.    The Chalicodoma's nests abound, but I cannot see a single Anthrax make  a black speck upon their surface. Not one, busy with her laying, settles  in front of me. At most, from time to time, I can just see one passing  far away, with an impetuous rush. I lose her in the distance; and that  is all. It is impossible to be present at the laying of the egg. I know  the little that I learnt from the cliffs in the Legue and nothing more.    As soon as I recognize the difficulty, I hasten to enlist assistants.  Shepherds--mere small boys--keep the sheep in these stony meadows,  where the flocks graze, to the greater glory of our local mutton, on the  camphor saturated badafo, that is to say, spike lavender. I explain as  well as I can the object of my search; I talk to them of a big black Fly  and the nests on which she ought to settle, the clay nests so well  known to those who have learnt how to extract the honey with a straw in  springtime and spread it on a crust of bread. They are to watch that fly  and take good note of the nests on which they may see her alight; and,  on the same evening, when they bring their flocks back to the village,  they are to tell me the result of their day's work. On receiving  their favorable report, I will go with them, next day, to continue the  observations. They shall be paid for their trouble, of course. These  latter day Corydons have not the manners of antiquity: they reck little  of the seven holed flute cemented with wax, or of the beechen bowl,  preferring the coppers that will take them to the village inn on Sunday.  A reward in ready money is promised for each nest that fulfils the  desired conditions; and the bargain is enthusiastically accepted.    There are three of them; and I make a fourth. Shall we manage it, among  us all? I thought so. By the end of August, however, my last illusions  were dispelled. Not one of us had succeeded in seeing the big black Fly  perching on the dome of the mason bee.    Our failure, it seems to me, can be explained thus: outside the spacious  front of the Anthophora's settlement, the Anthrax is in permanent  residence. She visits, on the wing, every nook and corner, without  moving away from the native cliff, because it would be useless to go  farther. There is board and lodging here, indefinitely, for all her  family. When some spot is deemed favorable, she hovers round inspecting  it, then comes up suddenly and strikes it with the tip of her abdomen.  The thing is done, the egg is laid. So I picture it, at least. Within a  radius of a few yards and in a flight broken by short intervals of rest  in the sun, she carries on her search of likely places for the laying  and dissemination of her eggs. The insect's assiduous attendance upon  the same slope is caused by the inexhaustible wealth of the locality  exploited.    The Anthrax of the Chalicodoma labors under very different conditions.  Stay-at-home habits would be detrimental to her. With her rushing  flight, made easy by the long and powerful spread of her wings, she must  travel far and wide if she would found a colony. The bee's nests are not  discovered in groups, but occur singly on their pebbles, scattered more  or less everywhere over acres of ground. To find a single one is not  enough for the fly: on account of the many parasites, not all the cells,  by a long way, contain the desired larva; others, too well protected,  would not allow of access to the provisions. Very many nests are  necessary, perhaps, for the eggs of one alone; and the finding of them  calls for long journeys.    I therefore picture the Anthrax coming and going in every direction  across the stony plain. Her practiced eye requires no slackened flight  to distinguish the earthen dome which she is seeking. Having found it,  she inspects it from above, still on the wing; she taps it once and  yet once again with the tip of her ovipositor and forthwith makes off,  without having set foot on the ground. Should she take a rest, it will  be elsewhere, no matter where, on the soil, on a stone, on a tuft  of lavender or thyme. Given these habits--and my observations in the  Carpentras roads make them seem exceedingly probable--it is small wonder  that the perspicacity of my young shepherds and myself should have come  to naught. I was expecting the impossible: the Anthrax does not halt on  the mason bee's nest to proceed with her laying in a methodical fashion;  she merely pays a flying visit.    And so I develop my theory of a primary larval form, differing in every  way from the one which I know. The organization of the Anthrax must be  such, at the beginning, as to permit of its moving on the surface of the  dome where the egg has been dropped so carelessly; the nascent grub must  be supplied with tools to pierce the concrete wall and enter the Bee's  cell through some cranny. The fly grub, perhaps dragging the remnants of  the egg behind it, must set out in quest of board and lodging almost as  soon as it is born. It will succeed under the guidance of instinct, that  faculty which waits not to number the days and which is as far seeing at  the moment of hatching as after the trials of a busy life. This primary  grub does not seem to me outside the limits of possibility; I see it, if  not in the body, at least in its actions, as plainly as though it were  really under the lens. It exists, if reason be not a vain and empty  guide; I must find it; I shall find it. Never in the history of my  investigations has the logic of things been more insistent; never has  it directed me with greater certainty towards a magnificent biological  theory.    While vainly trying to witness the laying of the eggs, I inquire, at the  same time, into the contents of the Mason bee's nests, in quest of  the grub just issued from the egg. My own harvest and that of my young  shepherds, whose zeal I employ in a task less difficult than the first,  procure me heaps of nests, enough to fill baskets and baskets. These are  all inspected at leisure, on my work table, with the excitement which  the certainty of an approaching fine discovery never fails to give. The  Mason's cocoons are taken from the cells, inspected without, opened and  inspected within. My lens explores their innermost recesses; speck by  speck, it explores the Chalicodoma's slumbering larva; it explores the  inner walls of the cells. Nothing, nothing, nothing! For a fortnight  and more, nests were rejected and heaped up in a corner; my study was  crammed with them. What hecatombs of unfortunate sleepers removed from  their silken bags and doomed, for the most part, to a wretched end,  despite the care which I took to put them in a place of safety, where  the work of the transformation might be pursued! Curiosity makes us  cruel. I continue to rip up cocoons. And nothing, nothing! It needed the  sturdiest faith to make me persevere. That faith I possessed; and well  for me that I did.    On the 25th of July--the date deserves to be recorded--I saw, or rather  seemed to see, something move on the Chalicodoma's larva. Was it an  illusion born of my hopes? Was it a bit of diaphanous down stirred by my  breath? It was not an illusion, it was not a bit of down, it was really  and truly a grub. What a moment,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#11)"],[1,"in the matter is in  your hands. Any suggestions you make, I will, of course, do my best to  carry out.\"    \"Thank ye. I must have more room in the hospital to begin with. The  soldiers must lie a little closer.\"    \"I will see what can be done.\"    \"And you had better keep your wife and the little girl as much on deck  as possible.\"    Vickers turned pale at the mention of his child. \"Good Heaven! do you  think there is any danger?\"    \"There is, of course, danger to all of us; but with care we may escape  it. There's that maid, too. Tell her to keep to herself a little more.  She has a trick of roaming about the ship I don't like. Infection is  easily spread, and children always sicken sooner than grown-up people.\"    Vickers pressed his lips together. This old man, with his harsh,  dissonant voice, and hideous practicality, seemed like a bird of ill  omen.    Blunt, hitherto silently listening, put in a word for defence of the  absent woman. \"The wench is right enough, Pine,\" said he. \"What's the  matter with her?\"    \"Yes, she's all right, I've no doubt. She's less likely to take it than  any of us. You can see her vitality in her face--as many lives as a cat.  But she'd bring infection quicker than anybody.\"    \"I'll--I'll go at once,\" cried poor Vickers, turning round. The woman of  whom they were speaking met him on the ladder. Her face was paler than  usual, and dark circles round her eyes gave evidence of a sleepless  night. She opened her red lips to speak, and then, seeing Vickers,  stopped abruptly.    \"Well, what is it?\"    She looked from one to the other. \"I came for Dr. Pine.\"    Vickers, with the quick intelligence of affection, guessed her errand.  \"Someone is ill?\"    \"Miss Sylvia, sir. It is nothing to signify, I think. A little feverish  and hot, and my mistress--\"    Vickers was down the ladder in an instant, with scared face.    Pine caught the girl's round firm arm. \"Where have you been?\" Two great  flakes of red came out in her white cheeks, and she shot an indignant  glance at Blunt.    \"Come, Pine, let the wench alone!\"    \"Were you with the child last night?\" went on Pine, without turning his  head.    \"No; I have not been in the cabin since dinner yesterday. Mrs. Vickers  only called me in just now. Let go my arm, sir, you hurt me.\"    Pine loosed his hold as if satisfied at the reply. \"I beg your pardon,\"  he said gruffly. \"I did not mean to hurt you. But the fever has broken  out in the prison, and I think the child has caught it. You must be  careful where you go.\" And then, with an anxious face, he went in  pursuit of Vickers.    Sarah Purfoy stood motionless for an instant, in deadly terror. Her lips  parted, her eyes glittered, and she made a movement as though to retrace  her steps.    \"Poor soul!\" thought honest Blunt, \"how she feels for the child! D----  that lubberly surgeon, he's hurt her!--Never mind, my lass,\" he  said aloud. It was broad daylight, and he had not as much courage in  love-making as at night. \"Don't be afraid. I've been in ships with fever  before now.\"    Awaking, as it were, at the sound of his voice, she came closer to him.  \"But ship fever! I have heard of it! Men have died like rotten sheep in  crowded vessels like this.\"    \"Tush! Not they. Don't be frightened; Miss Sylvia won't die, nor you  neither.\" He took her hand. \"It may knock off a few dozen prisoners or  so. They are pretty close packed down there--\"    She drew her hand away; and then, remembering herself, gave it him  again.    \"What is the matter?\"    \"Nothing--a pain. I did not sleep last night.\"    \"There, there; you are upset, I dare say. Go and lie down.\"    She was staring away past him over the sea, as if in thought. So  intently did she look that he involuntarily turned his head, and the  action recalled her to herself. She brought her fine straight brows  together for a moment, and then raised them with the action of a thinker  who has decided on his course of conduct.    \"I have a toothache,\" said she, putting her hand to her face.    \"Take some laudanum,\" says Blunt, with dim recollections of his mother's  treatment of such ailments. \"Old Pine'll give you some.\"    To his astonishment she burst into tears.    \"There--there! Don't cry, my dear. Hang it, don't cry. What are you  crying about?\"    She dashed away the bright drops, and raised her face with a rainy smile  of trusting affection. \"Nothing! I am lonely. So far from home; and--and  Dr. Pine hurt my arm. Look!\"    She bared that shapely member as she spoke, and sure enough there were  three red marks on the white and shining flesh.    \"The ruffian!\" cried Blunt, \"it's too bad.\" And after a hasty look  around him, the infatuated fellow kissed the bruise. \"I'll get the  laudanum for you,\" he said. \"You shan't ask that bear for it. Come into  my cabin.\"    Blunt's cabin was in the starboard side of the ship, just under the poop  awning, and possessed three windows--one looking out over the side, and  two upon deck. The corresponding cabin on the other side was occupied  by Mr. Maurice Frere. He closed the door, and took down a small medicine  chest, cleated above the hooks where hung his signal-pictured telescope.    \"Here,\" said he, opening it. \"I've carried this little box for years,  but it ain't often I want to use it, thank God. Now, then, put some o'  this into your mouth, and hold it there.\"    \"Good gracious, Captain Blunt, you'll poison me! Give me the bottle;  I'll help myself.\"    \"Don't take too much,\" says Blunt. \"It's dangerous stuff, you know.\"    \"You need not fear. I've used it before.\"    The door was shut, and as she put the bottle in her pocket, the amorous  captain caught her in his arms.    \"What do you say? Come, I think I deserve a kiss for that.\"    Her tears were all dry long ago, and had only given increased colour to  her face. This agreeable woman never wept long enough to make herself  distasteful. She raised her dark eyes to his for a moment, with a saucy  smile. \"By and by,\" said she, and escaping, gained her cabin. It was  next to that of her mistress, and she could hear the sick child feebly  moaning. Her eyes filled with tears--real ones this time.    \"Poor little thing,\" she said; \"I hope she won't die.\"    And then she threw herself on her bed, and buried her hot head in the  pillow. The intelligence of the fever seemed to have terrified her. Had  the news disarranged some well-concocted plan of hers? Being near the  accomplishment of some cherished scheme long kept in view, had the  sudden and unexpected presence of disease falsified her carefully-made  calculations, and cast an almost insurmountable obstacle in her path?    \"She die! and through me? How did I know that he had the fever? Perhaps  I have taken it myself--I feel ill.\" She turned over on the bed, as  if in pain, and then started to a sitting position, stung by a sudden  thought. \"Perhaps he might die! The fever spreads quickly, and if so,  all this plotting will have been useless. It must be done at once. It  will never do to break down now,\" and taking the phial from her pocket,  she held it up, to see how much it contained. It was three parts full.  \"Enough for both,\" she said, between her set teeth. The action of  holding up the bottle reminded her of the amorous Blunt, and she smiled.  \"A strange way to show affection for a man,\" she said to herself, \"and  yet he doesn't care, and I suppose I shouldn't by this time. I'll go  through with it, and, if the worst comes to the worst, I can fall back  on Maurice.\" She loosened the cork of the phial, so that it would come  out with as little noise as possible, and then placed it carefully in  her bosom. \"I will get a little sleep if I can,\" she said. \"They have  got the note, and it shall be done to-night.\"          CHAPTER VII. TYPHUS FEVER.        The felon Rufus Dawes had stretched himself in his bunk and tried to  sleep. But though he was tired and sore, and his head felt like lead, he  could not but keep broad awake. The long pull through the pure air, if  it had tired him, had revived him, and he felt stronger; but for all  that, the fatal sickness that was on him maintained its hold; his pulse  beat thickly, and his brain throbbed with unnatural heat. Lying in  his narrow space--in the semi-darkness--he tossed his limbs about, and  closed his eyes in vain--he could not sleep. His utmost efforts induced  only an oppressive stagnation of thought, through which he heard the  voices of his fellow-convicts; while before his eyes was still the  burning Hydaspes--that vessel whose destruction had destroyed for ever  all trace of the unhappy Richard Devine.    It was fortunate for his comfort, perhaps, that the man who had been  chosen to accompany him was of a talkative turn, for the prisoners  insisted upon hearing the story of the explosion a dozen times over, and  Rufus Dawes himself had been roused to give the name of the vessel with  his own lips. Had it not been for the hideous respect in which he was  held, it is possible that he might have been compelled to give his  version also, and to join in the animated discussion which took place  upon the possibility of the saving of the fugitive crew. As it was,  however, he was left in peace, and lay unnoticed, trying to sleep.    The detachment of fifty being on deck--airing--the prison was not quite  so hot as at night, and many of the convicts made up for their lack of  rest by snatching a dog-sleep in the bared bunks. The four volunteer  oarsmen were allowed to \"take it out.\"    As yet there had been no alarm of fever. The three seizures had excited  some comment, however, and had it not been for the counter-excitement of  the burning ship, it is possible that Pine's precaution would have  been thrown away. The \"Old Hands\"--who had been through the Passage  before--suspected, but said nothing, save among themselves. It was  likely that the weak and sickly would go first, and that there would be  more room for those "]]]
