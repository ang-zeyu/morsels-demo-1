[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#11)"],[1," The women of the Balhika country are gained over by striking.    The women of Avantika are fond of foul pleasures, and have not good  manners.    The women of the Maharashtra are fond of practising the sixty-four arts,  they utter low and harsh words, and like to be spoken to in the same  way, and have an impetuous desire of enjoyment.    The women of Pataliputra (_i.e._, the modern Patna) are of the same nature  as the women of the Maharashtra, but show their likings only in secret.    The women of the Dravida country, though they are rubbed and pressed  about at the time of sexual enjoyment, have a slow fall of semen, that  is they are very slow in the act of coition.    The women of Vanavasi are moderately passionate, they go through every  kind of enjoyment, cover their bodies, and abuse those who utter low,  mean and harsh words.    The women of Avanti hate kissing, marking with the nails, and biting,  but they have a fondness for various kinds of sexual union.    The women of Malwa like embracing and kissing, but not wounding, and  they are gained over by striking.    The women of Abhira, and those of the country about the Indus and five  rivers (_i.e._, the Punjab), are gained over by the Auparishtaka or mouth  congress.    The women of Aparatika are full of passion, and make slowly the sound  \"Sit.\"    The women of the Lat country have even more impetuous desire, and also  make the sound \"Sit.\"    The women of the Stri Rajya, and of Koshola (Oude), are full of  impetuous desire, their semen falls in large quantities, and they are  fond of taking medicine to make it do so.    The women of the Audhra country have tender bodies, they are fond of  enjoyment, and have a liking for voluptuous pleasures.    The women of Ganda have tender bodies, and speak sweetly.    Now Suvarnanabha is of opinion that that which is agreeable to the  nature of a particular person, is of more consequence than that which is  agreeable to a whole nation, and that therefore the peculiarities of the  country should not be observed in such cases. The various pleasures, the  dress, and the sports of one country are in time borrowed by another,  and in such a case these things must be considered as belonging  originally to that country.    Among the things mentioned above, viz., embracing, kissing, etc., those  which increase passion should be done first, and those which are only  for amusement or variety should be done afterwards.    There are also some verses on this subject as follows:    \"When a man bites a woman forcibly, she should angrily do the same to  him with double force. Thus a 'point' should be returned with a 'line of  points,' and a 'line of points' with a 'broken cloud,' and if she be  excessively chafed, she should at once begin a love quarrel with him. At  such a time she should take hold of her lover by the hair, and bend his  head down, and kiss his lower lip, and then, being intoxicated with  love, she should shut her eyes and bite him in various places. Even by  day, and in a place of public resort, when her lover shows her any mark  that she may have inflicted on his body, she should smile at the sight  of it, and turning her face as if she were going to chide him, she  should show him with an angry look the marks on her own body that have  been made by him. Thus if men and women act according to each other's  liking, their love for each other will not be lessened even in one  hundred years.\"          CHAPTER VI.    OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LYING DOWN, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF CONGRESS.      On the occasion of a \"high congress\" the Mrigi (Deer) woman should lie  down in such a way as to widen her yoni, while in a \"low congress\" the  Hastini (Elephant) woman should lie down so as to contract hers. But in  an \"equal congress\" they should lie down in the natural position. What  is said above concerning the Mrigi and the Hastini applies also to the  Vadawa (Mare) woman. In a \"low congress\" the women should particularly  make use of medicine, to cause her desires to be satisfied quickly.    The Deer-woman has the following three ways of lying down.       The widely opened position.     The yawning position.     The position of the wife of Indra.    (1). When she lowers her head and raises her middle parts, it is called  the \"widely opened position.\" At such a time the man should apply some  unguent, so as to make the entrance easy.    (2). When she raises her thighs and keeps them wide apart and engages in  congress, it is called the \"yawning position.\"    (3). When she places her thighs with her legs doubled on them upon her  sides, and thus engages in congress, it is called the position of  Indrani, and this is learnt only by practice. The position is also  useful in the case of the \"highest congress.\"    The \"clasping position\" is used in \"low congress,\" and in the \"lowest  congress,\" together with the \"pressing position,\" the \"twining  position\", and the \"mare's position.\"    When the legs of both the male and the female are stretched straight  out over each other, it is called the \"clasping position.\" It is of two  kinds, the side position and the supine position, according to the way  in which they lie down. In the side position the male should invariably  lie on his left side, and cause the woman to lie on her right side, and  this rule is to be observed in lying down with all kinds of women.    When, after congress has begun in the clasping position, the woman  presses her lover with her thighs, it is called the \"pressing position.\"    When the woman places one of her thighs across the thigh of her lover,  it is called the \"twining position.\"    When a woman forcibly holds in her yoni the lingam after it is in, it is  called the \"mare's position.\" This is learnt by practice only, and is  chiefly found among the women of the Andra country.    The above are the different ways of lying down, mentioned by Babhravya;  Suvarnanabha, however, gives the following in addition.    When the female raises both of her thighs straight up, it is called the  \"rising position.\"    When she raises both of her legs, and places them on her lover's  shoulders, it is called the \"yawning position.\"    When the legs are contracted, and thus held by the lover before his  bosom, it is called the \"pressed position.\"    When only one of her legs is stretched out, it is called the \"half  pressed position.\"    When the woman places one of her legs on her lover's shoulder, and  stretches the other out, and then places the latter on his shoulder, and  stretches out the other, and continues to do so alternately, it is  called the \"splitting of a bamboo.\"    When one of her legs is placed on the head, and the other is stretched  out, it is called the \"fixing of a nail.\" This is learnt by practice  only.    When both the legs of the woman are contracted, and placed on her  stomach, it is called the \"crab's position.\"    When the thighs are raised and placed one upon the other, it is called  the \"packed position.\"    When the shanks are placed one upon the other, it is called the  \"lotus-like position.\"    When a man, during congress, turns round, and enjoys the woman without  leaving her, while she embraces him round the back all the time, it is  called the \"turning position,\" and is learnt only by practice.    Thus says Suvarnanabha, these different ways of lying down, sitting, and  standing should be practised in water, because it is easy to do so  therein. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that congress in water is  improper, because it is prohibited by the religious law.    When a man and a woman support themselves on each other's bodies, or on  a wall, or pillar, and thus while standing engage in congress, it is  called the \"supported congress.\"    When a man supports himself against a wall, and the woman, sitting on  his hands joined together and held underneath her, throws her arms round  his neck, and putting her thighs alongside his waist, moves herself by  her feet, which are touching the wall against which the man is leaning,  it is called the \"suspended congress.\"    When a woman stands on her hands and feet like a quadruped, and her  lover mounts her like a bull, it is called the \"congress of a cow.\" At  this time everything that is ordinarily done on the bosom should be done  on the back.    In the same way can be carried on the congress of a dog, the congress of  a goat, the congress of a deer, the forcible mounting of an ass, the  congress of a cat, the jump of a tiger, the pressing of an elephant, the  rubbing of a boar, and the mounting of a horse. And in all these cases  the characteristics of these different animals should be manifested by  acting like them.    When a man enjoys two women at the same time, both of whom love him  equally, it is called the \"united congress.\"    When a man enjoys many women altogether, it is called the \"congress of a  herd of cows.\"    The following kinds of congress, viz., sporting in water, or the  congress of an elephant with many female elephants, which is said to  take place only in the water, the congress of a collection of goats, the  congress of a collection of deer, take place in imitation of these  animals.    In Gramaneri many young men enjoy a woman that may be married to one of  them, either one after the other, or at the same time. Thus one of them  holds her, another enjoys her, a third uses her mouth, a fourth holds  her middle part, and in this way they go on enjoying her several parts  alternately.    The same things can be done when several men are sitting in company with  one courtesan, or when one courtesan is alone with many men. In the same  way this can be done by the women of the King's harem when they  accidentally get hold of a man.    The people in the Southern countries have also a congress in the anus,  that is called the \"lower congress.\"    Thus ends the various kinds of congress. There are also two verses on  the subject as follows.    \"An ingenious person should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2785"],[0,"The Elusive Pimpernel (#11)"],[1,"   \"Chauvelin, Sir Percy,\" remarked the ex-ambassador drily.    He was determined not to lose his temper and looked urbane and pleasant,  whilst his impudent enemy was enjoying a joke at his expense. Marguerite  the while had not taken her eyes off the keen, shrewd face. Whilst the  three men talked, she seemed suddenly to have lost her sense of the  reality of things. The present situation appeared to her strangely  familiar, like a dream which she had dreamt oft times before.    Suddenly it became absolutely clear to her that the whole scene had been  arranged and planned: the booth with its flaring placard, Demoiselle  Candeille soliciting her patronage, her invitation to the young actress,  Chauvelin's sudden appearance, all, all had been concocted and arranged,  not here, not in England at all, but out there in Paris, in some dark  gathering of blood-thirsty ruffians, who had invented a final trap for  the destruction of the bold adventurer, who went by the name of the  Scarlet Pimpernel.    And she also was only a puppet, enacting a part which had been written  for her: she had acted just as THEY had anticipated, had spoken the very  words they had meant her to say: and when she looked at Percy, he seemed  supremely ignorant of it all, unconscious of this trap of the existence  of which everyone here present was aware, save indeed himself. She  would have fought against this weird feeling of obsession, of being a  mechanical toy would up to do certain things, but this she could not do;  her will appeared paralysed, her tongue even refused her service.    As in a dream she heard His Royal Highness ask for the name of the young  actress who was soliciting alms for the poor of Paris.    That also had been prearranged. His Royal Highness for the moment was  also a puppet, made to dance, to speak and to act as Chauvelin and his  colleagues over in France had decided that he should. Quite mechanically  Marguerite introduced Demoiselle Candeille to the Prince's gracious  notice.    \"If your Highness will permit,\" she said, \"Mademoiselle Candeille will  give us some of her charming old French songs at my rout to-morrow.\"    \"By all means! By all means!\" said the Prince. \"I used to know some  in my childhood days. Charming and poetic.... I know.... I know.... We  shall be delighted to hear Mademoiselle sing, eh, Blakeney?\" he added  good-humouredly, \"and for your rout to-morrow will you not also invite  M. Chauvelin?\"    \"Nay! but that goes without saying, your Royal Highness,\" responded Sir  Percy, with hospitable alacrity and a most approved bow directed at his  arch-enemy. \"We shall expect M. Chauvelin. He and I have not met for so  long, and he shall be made right welcome at Blakeney Manor.\"          Chapter IX: Demoiselle Candeille        Her origin was of the humblest, for her mother--so it was said--had  been kitchen-maid in the household of the Duc de Marny, but Desiree had  received some kind of education, and though she began life as a dresser  in one of the minor theatres of Paris, she became ultimately one of its  most popular stars.    She was small and dark, dainty in her manner and ways, and with a  graceful little figure, peculiarly supple and sinuous. Her humble  origin certainly did not betray itself in her hands and feet, which were  exquisite in shape and lilliputian in size.    Her hair was soft and glossy, always free from powder, and cunningly  arranged so as to slightly overshadow the upper part of her face.    The chin was small and round, the mouth extraordinarily red, the neck  slender and long. But she was not pretty: so said all the women. Her  skin was rather coarse in texture and darkish in colour, her eyes  were narrow and slightly turned upwards at the corners; no! she was  distinctly not pretty.    Yet she pleased the men! Perhaps because she was so artlessly determined  to please them. The women said that Demoiselle Candeille never left a  man alone until she had succeeded in captivating his fancy if only for  five minutes; an interval in a dance... the time to cross a muddy road.    But for five minutes she was determined to hold any man's complete  attention, and to exact his admiration. And she nearly always succeeded.    Therefore the women hated her. The men were amused. It is extremely  pleasant to have one's admiration compelled, one's attention so  determinedly sought after.    And Candeille could be extremely amusing, and as Madelon in Moliere's  \"Les Precieuses\" was quite inimitable.    This, however, was in the olden days, just before Paris went quite mad,  before the Reign of Terror had set in, and ci-devant Louis the King had  been executed.    Candeille had taken it into her frolicsome little head that she would  like to go to London. The idea was of course in the nature of an  experiment. Those dull English people over the water knew so little  of what good acting really meant. Tragedy? Well! passons! Their heavy,  large-boned actresses might manage one or two big scenes where a  commanding presence and a powerful voice would not come amiss, and where  prominent teeth would pass unnoticed in the agony of a dramatic climax.    But Comedy!    Ah! ca non, par example! Demoiselle Candeille had seen several English  gentlemen and ladies in those same olden days at the Tuileries, but  she really could not imagine any of them enacting the piquant scenes of  Moliere or Beaumarchais.    Demoiselle Candeille thought of every English-born individual as having  very large teeth. Now large teeth do not lend themselves to well-spoken  comedy scenes, to smiles, or to double entendre.    Her own teeth were exceptionally small and white, and very sharp, like  those of a kitten.    Yes! Demoiselle Candeille thought it would be extremely interesting to  go to London and to show to a nation of shopkeepers how daintily one can  be amused in a theatre.    Permission to depart from Paris was easy to obtain. In fact the fair  lady had never really found it difficult to obtain anything she very  much wanted.    In this case she had plenty of friends in high places. Marat was still  alive and a great lover of the theatre. Tallien was a personal admirer  of hers, Deputy Dupont would do anything she asked.    She wanted to act in London, at a theatre called Drury Lane. She wanted  to play Moliere in England in French, and had already spoken with  several of her colleagues, who were ready to join her. They would give  public representations in aid of the starving population of France;  there were plenty of Socialistic clubs in London quite Jacobin and  Revolutionary in tendency: their members would give her full support.    She would be serving her country and her countrymen and incidentally see  something of the world, and amuse herself. She was bored in Paris.    Then she thought of Marguerite St. Just, once of the Maison Moliere, who  had captivated an English milor of enormous wealth. Demoiselle Candeille  had never been of the Maison Moliere; she had been the leading star of  one of the minor--yet much-frequented--theatres of Paris, but she felt  herself quite able and ready to captivate some other unattached milor,  who would load her with English money and incidentally bestow an English  name upon her.    So she went to London.    The experiment, however, had not proved an unmitigated success. At first  she and her company did obtain a few engagements at one or two of the  minor theatres, to give representations of some of the French classical  comedies in the original language.    But these never quite became the fashion. The feeling against France  and all her doings was far too keen in that very set, which Demoiselle  Candeille had desired to captivate with her talents, to allow of the  English jeunesse doree to flock and see Moliere played in French, by a  French troupe, whilst Candeille's own compatriots resident in England  had given her but scant support.    One section of these--the aristocrats and emigres--looked upon the  actress who was a friend of all the Jacobins in Paris as nothing better  than canaille. They sedulously ignored her presence in this country, and  snubbed her whenever they had an opportunity.    The other section--chiefly consisting of agents and spies of the  Revolutionary Government--she would gladly have ignored. They had at  first made a constant demand on her purse, her talents and her time:  then she grew tired of them, and felt more and more chary of being  identified with a set which was in such ill-odour with that very same  jeunesse doree whom Candeille had desired to please.    In her own country she was and always had been a good republican: Marat  had given her her first start in life by his violent praises of her  talent in his widely-circulated paper; she had been associated in  Paris with the whole coterie of artists and actors: every one of them  republican to a man. But in London, although one might be snubbed by  the emigres and aristocrats--it did not do to be mixed up with the  sans-culotte journalists and pamphleteers who haunted the Socialistic  clubs of the English capital, and who were the prime organizers of all  those seditious gatherings and treasonable unions that caused Mr. Pitt  and his colleagues so much trouble and anxiety.    One by one, Desiree Candeille's comrades, male and female, who had  accompanied her to England, returned to their own country. When war was  declared, some of them were actually sent back under the provisions of  the Aliens Bill.    But Desiree had stayed on.    Her old friends in Paris had managed to advise her that she would not  be very welcome there just now. The sans-culotte journalists of England,  the agents and spies of the Revolutionary Government, had taken their  revenge of the frequent snubs inflicted upon them by the young actress,  and in those days the fact of being unwelcome in France was apt to have  a more lurid and more dangerous significant.    Candeille did not dare return: at"]]]
