The death of Cosmo, whose liberality had given him both affluence and  leisure, threatened Galileo with pecuniary difficulties. He had been  involved in a \"great load of debt,\" owing to the circumstances of his  brother's family; and, in order to relieve himself, he had requested  Castelli to dispose of the pension of his son Vincenzo. In addition to  this calamity he was now alarmed at the prospect of losing his salary as  an extraordinary professor at Pisa. The great youth of Ferdinand, who  was scarcely of age, induced Galileo's enemies, in 1629, to raise  doubts respecting the payment of a salary to a professor who neither  resided nor lectured in the university; but the question was decided in  his favour, and we have no doubt that the decision was facilitated by  the friendly recommendation of the Pope, to which we have already  referred.    Although Galileo had made a narrow escape from the grasp of the  Inquisition, yet he was never sufficiently sensible of the lenity which  he experienced. When he left Rome in 1616, under the solemn pledge of  never again teaching the obnoxious doctrine, it was with a hostility  against the church, suppressed but deeply cherished; and his resolution  to propagate the heresy seems to have been coeval with the vow by which  he renounced it. In the year 1618, when he communicated his theory of  the tides to the Archduke Leopold, he alludes in the most sarcastic  manner to the conduct of the church. The same hostile tone, more or  less, pervaded all his writings, and, while he laboured to sharpen the  edge of his satire, he endeavoured to guard himself against its effects,  by an affectation of the humblest deference to the decisions of  theology. Had Galileo stood alone, his devotion to science might have  withdrawn him from so hopeless a contest; but he was spurred on by the  violence of a party. The Lyncaean Academy never scrupled to summon him  from his researches. They placed him in the forlorn hope of their  combat, and he at last fell a victim to the rashness of his friends.    But whatever allowance we may make for the ardour of Galileo's temper,  and the peculiarity of his position; and however we may justify and even  approve of his past conduct, his visit to Urban VIII., in 1624, placed  him in a new relation to the church, which demanded on his part a new  and corresponding demeanour. The noble and generous reception which he  met with from Urban, and the liberal declaration of Cardinal Hohenzoller  on the subject of the Copernican system, should have been regarded as  expressions of regret for the past, and offers of conciliation for the  future. Thus honoured by the head of the church, and befriended by its  dignitaries, Galileo must have felt himself secure against the  indignities of its lesser functionaries, and in the possession of the  fullest license to prosecute his researches and publish his discoveries,  provided he avoided that dogma of the church which, even in the present  day, it has not ventured to renounce. But Galileo was bound to the  Romish hierarchy by even stronger ties. His son and himself were  pensioners of the church, and, having accepted of its alms, they owed to  it, at least, a decent and respectful allegiance. The pension thus given  by Urban was not a remuneration which sovereigns sometimes award to the  services of their subjects. Galileo was a foreigner at Rome. The  sovereign of the papal state owed him no obligation; and hence we must  regard the pension of Galileo as a donation from the Roman Pontiff to  science itself, and as a declaration to the Christian world that  religion was not jealous of philosophy, and that the church of Rome was  willing to respect and foster even the genius of its enemies.    Galileo viewed all these circumstances in a different light. He resolved  to compose a work in which the Copernican system should be demonstrated;  but he had not the courage to do this in a direct and open manner. He  adopted the plan of discussing the subject in a dialogue between three  speakers, in the hope of eluding by this artifice the censure of the  church. This work was completed in 1630, but, owing to some  difficulties in obtaining a license to print it, it was not published  till 1632.    In obtaining this license, Galileo exhibited considerable address, and  his memory has not escaped from the imputation of having acted unfairly,  and of having involved his personal friends in the consequences of his  imprudence.    The situation of master of the palace was, fortunately for Galileo's  designs, filled by Nicolo Riccardi, a friend and pupil of his own. This  officer was a sort of censor of new publications, and when he was  applied to on the subject of printing his work, Galileo soon found that  attempts had previously been made to thwart his views. He instantly set  off for Rome, and had an interview with his friend, who was in every  respect anxious to oblige him. Riccardi examined the manuscript, pointed  out some incautious expressions which he considered it necessary to  erase, and returned it with his written approbation, on the  understanding that the alterations he suggested would be made. Dreading  to remain in Rome during the unhealthy season, which was fast  approaching, Galileo returned to Florence, with the intention of  completing the index and dedication, and of sending the MS. to Rome, to  be printed under the care of Prince Cesi. The death of that  distinguished individual, in August 1630, frustrated Galileo's plan, and  he applied for leave to have the book printed in Florence. Riccardi was  at first desirous to examine the MS. again, but, after inspecting only  the beginning and the end of it, he gave Galileo leave to print it  wherever he chose, providing it bore the license of the  Inquisitor-General of Florence, and one or two other persons whom he  named.    Having overcome all these difficulties, Galileo's work was published in  1632, under the title of \"_The System of the World of Galileo Galilei_,  &c., in which, in four dialogues concerning the two principal systems of  the world--the Ptolemaic and the Copernican--he discusses,  indeterminately and firmly, the arguments proposed on both sides.\" It is  dedicated to Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and is prefaced by an  \"Address to the prudent reader,\" which is itself characterised by the  utmost imprudence. He refers to the decree of the Inquisition in the  most insulting and ironical language. He attributes it to passion and to  ignorance, not by direct assertion, but by insinuations ascribed to  others; and he announces his intention to defend the Copernican system,  as a pure mathematical hypothesis, and not as an opinion having an  advantage over that of the stability of the earth absolutely. The  dialogue is conducted by three persons, Salviati, Sagredo, and  Simplicio. Salviati, who is the true philosopher in the dialogue, was  the real name of a nobleman whom we have already had occasion to  mention. Sagredo, the name of another noble friend of Galileo's,  performs a secondary part under Salviati. He proposes doubts, suggests  difficulties, and enlivens the gravity of the dialogue with his wit and  pleasantry. Simplicio is a resolute follower of Ptolemy and Aristotle,  and, with a proper degree of candour and modesty, he brings forward all  the common arguments in favour of the Ptolemaic system. Between the wit  of Sagredo, and the powerful philosophy of Salviati, the peripatetic  sage is baffled in every discussion; and there can be no doubt that  Galileo aimed a more fatal blow at the Ptolemaic system by this mode of  discussing it, than if he had endeavoured to overturn it by direct  arguments.    The influence of this work on the public mind was such as might have  been anticipated. The obnoxious doctrines which it upheld were eagerly  received, and widely disseminated; and the church of Rome became  sensible of the shock which was thus given to its intellectual  supremacy. Pope Urban VIII., attached though he had been to Galileo,  never once hesitated respecting the line of conduct which he felt  himself bound to pursue. His mind was, nevertheless, agitated with  conflicting sentiments. He entertained a sincere affection for science  and literature, and yet he was placed in the position of their enemy. He  had been the personal friend of Galileo, and yet his duty compelled him  to become his accuser. Embarrassing as these feelings were, other  considerations contributed to soothe him. He had, in his capacity of a  Cardinal, opposed the first persecution of Galileo. He had, since his  elevation to the pontificate, traced an open path for the march of  Galileo's discoveries; and he had finally endeavoured to bind the  recusant philosopher by the chains of kindness and gratitude. All these  means, however, had proved abortive, and he was now called upon to  support the doctrine which he had subscribed, and administer the law of  which he was the guardian.    It has been supposed, without any satisfactory evidence, that Urban may  have been influenced by less creditable motives. Salviati and Sagredo  being well-known personages, it was inferred that Simplicio must also  have a representative. The enemies of Galileo are said to have convinced  his Holiness that Simplicio was intended as a portraiture of himself;  and this opinion received some probability from the fact, that the  peripatetic disputant had employed many of the arguments which Urban had  himself used in his discussions with Galileo. The latest biographer of  Galileo[33] regards this motive as necessary to account for \"the  otherwise inexplicable change which took place in the conduct of Urban  to his old friend;\"--but we cannot admit the truth of this supposition.

Make a syrup of five cups of sugar and one cup of water and  boil the orange in this until the syrup is almost boiled away.

Housekeeping money to many men means the actual money       required for food. Not very many husbands realize how many       little expenses the housekeeping money has to take care       of--little expenses that have nothing to do with food. Here       are some and the Editor will be very glad if the readers       will send in their own experiences in this line.      [Illustration]    Most men smoke, and most men like to pocket a nice fresh box of matches  when starting off for the day. Matches don't cost much to be sure but a  fresh box each morning cuts quite a hole in the housekeeping money which  is used to buy them.           *       *       *       *       *    Does your husband like to sit up late reading, playing chess, etc.? That  sort of thing increases the light and coal bill quite a bit.           *       *       *       *       *    The pennies given for charity, church collections, etc., are also  \"extras.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Returning little courtesies--very often to \"his\" people--such as sending  flowers, books, and occasional lunch or matinee, etc., etc., all make  quite a hole in the housekeeping money.           *       *       *       *       *    The wear and tear of household utensils, linen, etc., means constant  replenishment of one thing or another. A man may realize that his buggy  or motor car has to have certain parts replaced once in a while but he  is not apt to think of the pots and pans of the household side of things  unless reminded.           *       *       *       *       *    It is a good plan to keep a few simple medicines at hand in case of  sudden sickness, also a few bandages and the usual dressings required  for accidents. Does your housekeeping money make provision for this?           *       *       *       *       *    Money for the education of the children is not generally included in the  housekeeping money, but when the children get old enough to want to have  their friends visit them it means little lunches, suppers,  entertainments of various kinds, all of which cuts into the housekeeping  money. As this is really the social side of their education it is only  fair that extra provision should be made for it.          Why Eat Fruit?    [Illustration]      It is a very good plan to find out the medicinal and curative properties  of the different fruits and to make the fruit your system requires a  part of your diet.    Apples, for instance, have an excellent effect on the health generally.  They contain a large proportion of water and a large quantity of potash  as well as of malic acid, which has valuable properties, and ether which  is beneficial to the liver. Plums, too, have certain virtues and lemons  are good for several forms of stomach trouble. As for grapes, they are  so valuable as to form a distinctive \"cure\" just in themselves. They  possess an enormous quantity of potash and plenty of water and they also  contain sugar and salts of tartar. That all means that grapes will do  much for the person who is tired and run down, whose nerves are weakened  and whose organs are overworked, that they will tone and regulate the  system, purify the blood and assist the different organs in performing  their functions. The presence of sugar indicates that they can provide  fuel for the body--the human engine--whether it be the romping child or  the man whose day is filled with hard physical labor. So it follows that  grapes are really a very valuable addition to our diet list.    Unfortunately, it is not always possible to have grapes on our table but  wise manufacturers have found a way by which the juice of the grape may  be possible at all times of the year and in every corner of the land.  They have built large factories right in the very heart of the country  where the best grapes grow and there the grapes are taken while the dew  is still on them and their luscious fragrant deliciousness is squeezed  out, poured into bottles and quickly sealed to prevent any escape of the  exquisite bouquet.    Nothing is added--no water to weaken and adulterate, no sugar to  sweeten, no coloring essence to deceive the eye. It is just the pure,  natural juice of earth's best offering. This bottled concentration of  earth's sweetness and richness with all the life and warmth of the  sunshine is Armour's Grape Juice.

To the woman, however, who is really interested in furnishing  variety in diet, and this in a very economical way, baked beans offers  boundless possibilities. First of all, she lays in a stock of Veribest  Baked Beans--Veribest, because she knows that in this particular brand  the beans are even more thoroughly cooked than she herself could do  them. There are two kinds of Veribest Baked Beans, plain, and with  tomato sauce, and with both the mellow richness of the bean is preserved  with all its natural flavor, making it a most toothsome dish as well as  nutritious and economical. Having a good stock to draw from the  economical housewife proceeds to serve baked beans to her family every  day for a week, varying the dish each day.    FOR MONDAY there is a New England Supper--baked beans with hot Boston  brown bread. Drop the can of baked beans into hot water and boil for 20  minutes. Turn out, garnish with parsley and serve with mustard pickles.    TUESDAY, FOR LUNCH.--BEAN CROQUETTES. Drain Veribest Pork and Beans  (without tomato sauce), and pass them through a colander. Measure and  allow one teaspoon of dry bread crumbs to each cup of beans. Season with  cayenne pepper and a little minced parsley. For a pint of the mixture,  beat one egg. Save enough of the egg to dip the croquettes in, and add  the remainder to the beans. Mix and form into small croquettes, or  balls, then roll in fine bread crumbs. Dip them in egg and again in the  crumbs, and fry in deep boiling Simon Pure Leaf Lard. Border with slices  of dill pickles or sweet green peppers.    WEDNESDAY, SCHOOL LUNCHES.--BEAN SANDWICHES. Cut some thin slices from a  loaf of brown bread, butter and put crisp lettuce leaves, with a  teaspoon of mayonnaise, on each half of the slices, and on the others  spread a layer of Armour's Veribest Pork and Beans, which have been  mashed until smooth.
