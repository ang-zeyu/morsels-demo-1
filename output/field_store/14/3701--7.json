If he has eaten a  large meal of frozen meat and then the poison, he will go far enough  so he will be hard to find, and never found if you have any amount of  bait to look after and it blows and covers his tracks up and maybe  his carcass too. The result is that it makes other animals of his  tribe leery about taking baits.\"    \"Birds such as magpies, ravens, and crows will eat poison and fly off  and die and be devoured by coyotes, foxes, mink, skunk, etc. The  result is that many of them die, and what don't, get so sick that  they are very careful about touching the next bait they see,  generally giving it a wide berth. Then there are lots of birds, such  as camp robbers and magpies that carry it off and store it away for  martens or something else to eat and get poisoned by. There was a  very large amount of skunk, but owing to the fact that many people  poison whole carcasses for coyotes and wolves, they are rapidly  disappearing.\"    \"Some people claim that the dog destroys more furs than anything, but  I believe that strychnine is a greater evil than a dog or at least in  this county, so you see I have a good reason for advising a trapper  not to use strychnine. It is the easiest way and the quickest way to  get a few furs, if in the hands of an experienced man, but the furs  are always a lower grade because the poison acts on the fur and there  is always a hide now and then that the hunter will not find at once.\"    \"The trapper will have the most furs and in the best condition at the  end of the season and generally a place to trap more at the next  season. The strychnine hunter will have to hunt a different place as  what animals he failed to kill, will leave the country or become so  wary that they will not touch bait. An animal which has recovered  from a dose of poison, carries a pelt that is oft times worthless.\"        CHAPTER IX.    TRAPPING WOLVES.    After all of the various methods of hunting have been given a fair  and impartial trial it will usually be found that trapping is the  best means of capturing the wolf and coyote. Large numbers of traps  may be set and attended to and the chances of making a good catch are  greatly increased by so doing. If one has a liking for the work,  makes a study of the animals and sets the traps carefully, good  results are sure to follow. In all probability, four fifths of the  coyotes and wolves captured in the United States are taken in this  way. It is quite common for the professional trapper to take one  hundred or more coyotes and wolves in a season.    The trap that is recommended for the timber wolf and the only one  that was ever designed for capturing that animal is the \"Newhouse\"  No. 4 1/2. It is a large and powerful trap, having a spread of jaws  of 8 inches with the other parts properly proportioned. It is  furnished with a two pronged drag and a heavy steel chain, guaranteed  to stand a strain of 2000 pounds. The trap complete with chain and  drag weighs about 8 pounds. A simpler and stronger chain fastening  than that shown in the cut, is now used for attaching the chain to  the trap.      [Illustration: No. 4 1/2 Newhouse Wolf Trap.]    Although the No. 4 1/2 is the trap recommended for timber wolves, the  No. 4 Newhouse is probably preferred by the average trapper, because  of its lighter weight and its adaptability to catching coyotes, which  are found in greater abundance than wolves. The trap has a spread of  jaws of 6 1/2 inches, and its strength is sufficient for holding  almost any wolf, providing the captured animal is not allowed to  struggle too long, and that the trap is not staked, or otherwise  securely fastened. Even when securely staked the No. 4 Newhouse will  hold almost any one of the younger grey wolves, and it is mostly the  young animals that are captured.      [Illustration: The Two-Pronged Drag.]    The standard trap is furnished with a short chain and ring, but when  so ordered, the manufacturers will gladly furnish the traps with  longer chains and the two pronged drag shown in the cut, or if  desired the drags alone may be purchased and attached to any trap  chain. The two pronged drag has an advantage over the four pronged  kind, as it will occupy less space and may be more easily secreted.    It will be noted that the chain of the No. 4 1/2 trap has a double  end. This is so that it may be looped around a small log or block of  wood, if it is desired to do so. Some trappers prefer the chain  without the iron drag, and for such the drag will be omitted. Others  prefer to use the No. 4 trap with a 5 foot chain and a stone wired  securely to the end. This makes a very good combination, but for some  sections is not practicable as stones are \"few and far between.\"      [Illustration: Method of Attaching an Oblong Stone.]      [Illustration: Method of Attaching a Triangular Stone.]    On the subject of fastening traps, Mr. Vernon Bailey of the  Biological Survey gives the following:    \"The best anchor for a wolf trap is a stone drag of 30 or 40 pounds  weight, to which the trap is securely wired. A long oval stone is the  best, but a triangular or square stone can be securely wired.  Ordinary galvanized fence wire or telegraph wire should be fastened  around the ends of the stone and connected by a double loop of the  wire, then the trap chain fastened to the middle of this loop. A jerk  on the trap tends to draw the bands together, and the spring of the  connecting wire loop prevents a sudden jar that might break trap or  chain. Twisted or barbed fence wire may be used if sufficiently  strong, but it is not so easily handled. If no stones are available,  or if the trap must be immovably fixed, it should be fastened with a  twisted iron stake that can be driven below the surface of the  ground. These stakes should be at least 18 inches long and of good  iron straps three quarters of an inch wide and three-sixteenths of an  inch thick. In light soil they should be still longer. See figures 1  and 2. If a picket pin sufficiently strong, provided with a swivel  that will turn in all directions, can be purchased at the local  hardware store, it may not be necessary to have a pin made to order.\"      [Illustration: Iron Stakes for Traps.]    It is our opinion that the twisted pin would not be as satisfactory  as the plain one shown in Fig. 3. If the swivel should lock, and fail  to work, the stake might be twisted out of the ground by the  struggles of the animal. With the heavy, square pin shown in Fig. 3,  this could not occur. The pin should be made of wrought iron, about  5/8 or 3/4 inch in diameter at the top, and tapering to a point. The  length should be the same as those described above.    The majority of the trappers who prefer to stake the traps use  hardwood stakes and attach the chains by means of hay baling wire,  twisting it with a pair of pliers. In many parts of the wolf country,  hardwood is not to be had and many of the trappers use the spokes of  old wagon wheels for trap stakes. We believe, however, that iron  stakes are to be preferred to wooden ones.    The traps to use for coyotes are the Nos. 3 and 4 and the most  suitable style of chain would depend entirely on the method of  setting and fastening the traps. In some of the sets described, for  both wolf and coyote, the traps, some three or four in number, are  all fastened to one stake and for such a set the chains should be  short, as also in the bank set. Where it is desired to use a drag of  any kind, the chain should be 4 or 5 feet in length. This should be  remembered when purchasing the traps and the method of setting that  will be used should be kept in mind.    As before mentioned, most of the wolves caught are young animals less  than a year old. After a wolf has reached its third year, it has  attained a high degree of intelligence, and comparatively few of that  age are caught in traps. In some sections wolves are more wary than  in others and are more difficult of capture. This depends much on the  abundance or scarcity of food and the amount of hunting and trapping  that has already been done in that section. Where wolves and coyotes  have not been trapped much, they are less shy but they are always  sufficiently wary to make extreme care in setting the traps necessary  for success.    No matter what method of trapping may be employed, there is only one  satisfactory way of setting the trap, on bare ground. In a smooth,  sandy spot, dig out a hollow the same shape as the set trap and of  such a depth that when the trap is in place and covered with about  1/4 inch of dirt, the covering will be flush with the surrounding  surface of the ground. A narrow trench may then be made, to  accommodate the chain, and a hole in which to bury the drag. If a  stake is used it may be driven under the trap and the trench will not  be needed, or it may be driven at the side according to the method of  setting but the stake must be neatly covered in all cases. The trap  is then placed in position, the chain, drag and springs are covered  and the portion outside of the jaws is filled with dirt, leaving only  the jaws and pan uncovered. Now a sheet of clean paper should be  placed over the jaws and pan and the whole covered with about 1/4 or  3/8 inch of fine dirt, covering the edges first and finishing with  the center. A piece of canvas or hide should be provided, on which to  place the dirt while setting the traps, and with which to carry away  what is not needed for covering. When the setting is finished  everything should look as smooth and undisturbed as it did before the  trap was set.      [Illustration: Trap Set and Ready for Covering.]    In case the paper sags between the trap jaws and the pan, a few lumps  of ground may be so placed as to support it, but care must be used so  that no dirt gets under the pan.

Both collections were at downstream stations. At station C-4  three half-grown drum were taken. Fishermen take \"drum\" at least as far  upstream as station C-5 on Big Caney River. In the Elk River one  specimen was taken in a 20-foot seine below a dam at Elk Falls.          FISHES OF DOUBTFUL OR POSSIBLE OCCURRENCE      In addition to the species listed above, the following species have been  reported nearby and may occur within the area surveyed.    _Lepisosteus productus_ (Cope)--This gar has not been reported from  Kansas. It has been taken at several points in the northern half of  Oklahoma and as far west as Canton Reservoir by Buck and Cross (1951). A  specimen of the spotted gar was taken by Elkin (1954:28) in Salt Creek  in Osage County, Oklahoma.    _Polyodon spathula_ (Walbaum)--The paddlefish has never been reported  from the Arkansas River system in Kansas. Several reports by fishermen  were traced by the writer, but authentication was not achieved. One  mounted specimen was examined in a sporting goods store in Arkansas  City. This fish was said to have been taken on the Arkansas River south  of Arkansas City but information on the date and method of capture were  vague. Mr. Darrell Wheat of Arkansas City reported taking four  paddlefish below a dam at Oxford, Kansas, in 1948 and 1949.    _Hiodon alosoides_ (Rafinesque)--One specimen (K. U. 3095) of the  goldeye was taken in 1953 on the Arkansas River near Oxford in Sumner  County. Fishermen also report taking this fish occasionally in the  Walnut River in Cowley County.    _Noturus flavus_ (Rafinesque)--The stonecat was taken in the Verdigris  system by R. D. Lindsay in 1911 (K. U. 2058) and more recently by Cross  in Montgomery County (C-120) and Schelske (1957:46) in Wilson and  Montgomery Counties. The close proximity of these collection areas to  lower portions of the Elk River indicate probable occurrence in Elk  River and other Verdigris tributaries.    _Noturus nocturnus_ (Jordan and Gilbert)--The freckled madtom has been  taken on all sides of the area studied making its occurrence therein  highly probable. This madtom has been taken in Beaver Creek in Osage  County, Oklahoma (OAM 4771); from a tributary of the Walnut River in  Sedgwick County by Cross (1954); from the Chikaskia River (Moore and  Buck, 1953:24); and from several localities on the Verdigris River  (Schelske, 1957:47).    _Etheostoma cragini_ (Gilbert)--One Cragin's darter (K. U. 3470) was  taken by Cross in the Arkansas River near the Sumner-Cowley county line  (Sec. 25, T31S, R2E). Records of this darter are few and widely  scattered geographically. Several collections from north-eastern  Oklahoma are noted by Moore and Cross (1950:144).    _Etheostoma whipplii_ (Girard)--Schelske (1957:38) reports the redfin  darter from the Verdigris River three miles southeast of Benedict,  Kansas. Dr. George Moore of Oklahoma A. & M. College states that it has  been taken in the Verdigris drainage in Oklahoma at several locations.    _Etheostoma zonale arcansanum_ (Jordan and Gilbert)--Two banded darters  (K. U. 3213) have been reported by Schelske (1957:49) from Fall River  near Neodesha, Kansas. Because a tributary of Fall River enters Elk  County its presence in this and other Verdigris tributaries in the area  seems possible. This darter has been reported from only one other stream  in Kansas, Shoal Creek in Cherokee County, where it has been collected  often.    _Roccus chrysops_ (Rafinesque)--The white bass has been stocked in Hulah  Reservoir on Big Caney River in Oklahoma. To date it has not been  reported from the Big Caney in Kansas. White bass are common in many  reservoirs of Kansas and Oklahoma and have been taken in rivers in both  states. Mr. Clement Gillespie of Arkansas City, Kansas Forestry, Fish  and Game Commission wildlife protector for the area, states that two  hundred young of _R. chrysops_ were released in Grouse Creek several  years ago under auspices of the Commission. The fish has not been  reported by fishermen since that time to the knowledge of Mr. Gillespie  or of the writer.    _Lepomis microlophus_ (Gunther)--One redear sunfish was taken on Salt  Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma, by Elkin (1954:28). Because this  species has been stocked widely in Oklahoma its eventual occurrence in  Kansas seems probable.    _Chaenobryttus gulosus_ (Cuvier)--The warmouth has been taken south of  the collection area in Osage County on Salt Creek by Elkin (1954:28).          FAUNAL COMPARISONS OF DIFFERENT STREAMS      The faunas of Elk River, Big Caney River, and Grouse Creek were  generally similar. These streams and most of their tributaries originate  in the same hilly area of eastern Cowley County and western Elk and  Chautauqua counties; their similarities and differences have been  pointed out.    The following species were taken in all of these streams:      _Lepisosteus osseus_    _Dorosoma cepedianum_    _Ictiobus bubalus_    _Moxostoma erythrurum_    _Minytrema melanops_    _Cyprinus carpio_    _Campostoma anomalum_    _Notropis boops_    _Notropis lutrensis_    _Notropis umbratilis_    _Notropis volucellus_    _Pimephales notatus_    _Pimephales tenellus_    _Fundulus notatus_    _Gambusia affinis_    _Ictalurus melas_    _Ictalurus punctatus_    _Etheostoma spectabile_    _Percina caprodes_    _Micropterus salmoides_    _Pomoxis annularis_    _Lepomis cyanellus_    _Lepomis humilis_    _Lepomis megalotis_    _Lepomis macrochirus_    _Labidesthes sicculus_    No species was found in Elk River to the exclusion of Big Caney and  Grouse Creek. Fish taken exclusively in Grouse Creek were _Ictiobus  cyprinella_ at station G-2 and _Notropis percobromus_ at station G-1.  The following species were taken only in Big Caney River: _Ictiobus  niger_, _Notropis rubellus_, _Phenacobius mirabilis_, _Pimephales  vigilax_, and _Pomoxis nigromaculatus_.    _Notropis buchanani_ and _Pimephales promelas_ were taken in Grouse  Creek and Elk River, but not in Big Caney River, although the watershed  of Big Caney lies largely between these two streams. Three species,  _Notropis camurus_, _Micropterus punctulatus_, and _Aplodinotus  grunniens_, were found in Elk River and Big Caney but not in Grouse  Creek. _Ictalurus natalis_, _Pylodictis olivaris_, and _Percina  phoxocephala_ were taken in Big Caney River and Grouse Creek but not in  Elk River. _Percina copelandi_ was taken by Cross on Elk River in 1954  and 1955 (K. U. 3464 and K. U. 3197).    Forty species were taken in Big Caney River, 35 in Grouse Creek and 31  in Elk River. Collections were made from only six stations on Elk River  as compared with 18 from Big Caney and 17 from Grouse Creek.    Twenty-four species were taken in the Walnut River system, only one of  which (_Notemigonus crysoleucas_) was taken exclusively there.    In the Arkansas River 18 species were found, four of which did not occur  elsewhere. These were _Hybopsis aestivalis_, _Notropis blennius_, _N.  girardi_, and _Fundulus kansae_.
