As for his father and mother, they both  begged of him to give up, his father offering to give him anything  he possessed if he would only stay at home. But he said, \"I don't  hear what you are saying; good-bye,\" and was off again.    This time he still further increased the distance from his home, and  at last he saw an elephant asleep at noon in the forest. Thereupon  he said to his attendants, \"Now we have found the noondah.\"    \"Ah, where is he?\" said they.    \"Yonder, in the shade. Do you see it?\"    \"Oh, yes, master; shall we march up to it?\"    \"If we march up to it, and it is looking this way, it will come at us,  and if it does that, some of us will be killed. I think we had best  let one man steal up close and see which way its face is turned.\"    As every one thought this was a good idea, a slave named Keerobo'to  crept on his hands and knees, and had a good look at it. When he  returned in the same manner, his master asked: \"Well, what's the  news? Is it the noondah?\"    \"I do not know,\" replied Keeroboto; \"but I think there is very little  doubt that it is. It is broad, with a very big head, and, goodness,  I never saw such large ears!\"    \"All right,\" said Mkaaah Jeechonee; \"let us eat, and then go for it.\"    So they took their arrowroot cakes, and their molasses cakes, and  ate until they were quite full.    Then the youth said to them: \"My people, to-day is perhaps the last we  shall ever see; so we will take leave of each other. Those who are to  escape will escape, and those who are to die will die; but if I die,  let those who escape tell my mother and father not to grieve for me.\"    But his attendants said, \"Oh, come along, master; none of us will die,  please God.\"    So they went on their hands and knees till they were close up, and  then they said to Mkaaah Jeechonee, \"Give us your plan, master;\"  but he said, \"There is no plan, only let all fire at once.\"    Well, they fired all at once, and immediately the elephant jumped  up and charged at them. Then such a helter-skelter flight as there  was! They threw away their guns and everything they carried, and made  for the trees, which they climbed with surprising alacrity.    As to the elephant, he kept straight ahead until he fell down some  distance away.    They all remained in the trees from three until six o'clock in the  morning, without food and without clothing.    The young man sat in his tree and wept bitterly, saying, \"I don't  exactly know what death is, but it seems to me this must be very  like it.\" As no one could see any one else, he did not know where  his attendants were, and though he wished to come down from the tree,  he thought, \"Maybe the noondah is down below there, and will eat me.\"    Each attendant was in exactly the same fix, wishing to come down,  but afraid the noondah was waiting to eat him.    Keeroboto had seen the elephant fall, but was afraid to get down  by himself, saying, \"Perhaps, though it has fallen down, it is not  dead.\" But presently he saw a dog go up to it and smell it, and then  he was sure it was dead. Then he got down from the tree as fast as  he could and gave a signal cry, which was answered; but not being  sure from whence the answer came, he repeated the cry, listening  intently. When it was answered he went straight to the place from which  the sound proceeded, and found two of his companions in one tree. To  them he said, \"Come on; get down; the noondah is dead.\" So they got  down quickly and hunted around until they found their master. When  they told him the news, he came down also; and after a little the  attendants had all gathered together and had picked up their guns  and their clothes, and were all right again. But they were all weak  and hungry, so they rested and ate some food, after which they went  to examine their prize.    As soon as Mkaaah Jeechonee saw it he said, \"Ah, this is the  noondah! This is it! This is it!\" And they all agreed that it was it.    So they dragged the elephant three days to their town, and then the  youth began singing,              \"Oh, mother, this is he,          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      He was, naturally, quite upset when his mother replied, \"My son,  this is not the noondah, eater of the people.\" She further said:  \"Poor boy! what trouble you have been through. All the people are  astonished that one so young should have such a great understanding!\"    Then his father and mother began their entreaties again, and finally  it was agreed that this next trip should be his last, whatever the  result might be.    Well, they started off again, and went on and on, past the forest,  until they came to a very high mountain, at the foot of which they  camped for the night.    In the morning they cooked their rice and ate it, and then Mkaaah  Jeechonee said: \"Let us now climb the mountain, and look all over the  country from its peak.\" And they went and they went, until after a  long, weary while, they reached the top, where they sat down to rest  and form their plans.    Now, one of the attendants, named Shindaa'no, while walking about,  cast his eyes down the side of the mountain, and suddenly saw a great  beast about half way down; but he could not make out its appearance  distinctly, on account of the distance and the trees. Calling his  master, he pointed it out to him, and something in Mkaaah Jeechonee's  heart told him that it was the noondah. To make sure, however, he  took his gun and his spear and went partly down the mountain to get  a better view.    \"Ah,\" said he, \"this must be the noondah. My mother told me its ears  were small, and those are small; she told me the noondah is broad and  short, and so is this; she said it has two blotches, like a civet cat,  and there are the blotches; she told me the tail is thick, and there  is a thick tail. It must be the noondah.\"    Then he went back to his attendants and bade them eat heartily, which  they did. Next he told them to leave every unnecessary thing behind,  because if they had to run they would be better without encumbrance,  and if they were victorious they could return for their goods.    When they had made all their arrangements they started down the  mountain, but when they had got about half way down Keeroboto and  Shindaano were afraid. Then the youth said to them: \"Oh, let's go on;  don't be afraid. We all have to live and die. What are you frightened  about?\" So, thus encouraged, they went on.    When they came near the place, Mkaaah Jeechonee ordered them to take  off all their clothing except one piece, and to place that tightly  on their bodies, so that if they had to run they would not be caught  by thorns or branches.    So when they came close to the beast, they saw that it was asleep,  and all agreed that it was the noondah.    Then the young man said, \"Now the sun is setting, shall we fire at it,  or let be till morning?\"    And they all wished to fire at once, and see what the result would  be without further tax on their nerves; therefore they arranged that  they should all fire together.    They all crept up close, and when the master gave the word, they  discharged their guns together. The noondah did not move; that one  dose had been sufficient. Nevertheless, they all turned and scampered  up to the top of the mountain. There they ate and rested for the night.    In the morning they ate their rice, and then went down to see how  matters were, when they found the beast lying dead.    After resting and eating, they started homeward, dragging the dead  beast with them. On the fourth day it began to give indications of  decay, and the attendants wished to abandon it; but Mkaaah Jeechonee  said they would continue to drag it if there was only one bone left.    When they came near the town he began to sing,              \"Mother, mother, I have come          From the evil spirits, home.          Mother, listen while I sing;          While I tell you what I bring.          Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      And when his mother looked out, she cried, \"My son, this is the  noondah, eater of the people.\"    Then all the people came out to welcome him, and his father was  overcome with joy, and loaded him with honors, and procured him a rich  and beautiful wife; and when he died Mkaaah Jeechonee became sultan,  and lived long and happily, beloved by all the people.                IX.    THE MAGICIAN AND THE SULTAN'S SON.      There was once a sultan who had three little sons, and no one seemed  to be able to teach them anything; which greatly grieved both the  sultan and his wife.    One day a magician came to the sultan and said, \"If I take your three  boys and teach them to read and write, and make great scholars of them,  what will you give me?\"    And the sultan said, \"I will give you half of my property.\"    \"No,\" said the magician; \"that won't do.\"    \"I'll give you half of the towns I own.\"    \"No; that will not satisfy me.\"    \"What do you want, then?\"    \"When I have made them scholars and bring them back to you, choose  two of them for yourself and give me the third; for I want to have  a companion of my own.\"    \"Agreed,\" said the sultan.    So the magician took them away, and in a remarkably short time  taught them to read, and to make letters, and made them quite good  scholars. Then he took them back to the sultan and said: \"Here are  the children. They are all equally good scholars. Choose.\"    So the sultan took the two he preferred, and the magician went away  with the third, whose name was Keejaa'naa, to his own house, which  was a very large one.    When they arrived, Mchaa'wee, the magician, gave the youth all the  keys, saying, \"Open whatever you wish to.\" Then he told him that he  was his father, and that he was going away for a month.    When he was gone,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#11)"],[1,"technique of the mystic  procedure.    \"The word mystic,\" to quote Walter Pater, \"has been derived from  a Greek word which signifies to shut, as if one shut one's lips,  brooding on what cannot be uttered; but the Platonists themselves  derive it rather from the act of shutting the eyes, that one may  see the more, inwardly.\"  Of such is the counsel of St. Luis de  Granada, \"Imitate the sportsman who hoods the falcon that it be  made subservient to his rule;\" and of another Spanish mystic,  Pedro de Alcantara:  \"In meditation, let the person rouse himself  from things temporal, and let him collect himself within himself  ....Here let him hearken to the voice of God...as though there  were no other in the world save God and himself.\"  St. Teresa  found happiness only in \"shutting herself up within herself.\"  Vocal prayer could not satisfy her, and she adopted mental  prayer.  The four stages of her experience--which she named  \"recollectedness,\" \"quietude\" (listening rather than speaking),  \"union\" (blissful sleep with the faculties of the mind still),  \"ecstasy or rapture\"--are but progressive steps in the sealing  of the senses.  The yoga of the Brahmins, which is the same as  the \"union\" of the Cabalists, is made to depend upon the same  conditions,--passivity, perseverance, solitude.  The novice  must arrest his breathing, and may meditate on mystic symbols  alone, by way of reaching the formless, ineffable Buddha.  But  it is useless to heap up evidence; the inference is sufficiently  clear.    The body is first brought into a state either of nervous  instability or irritability by ascetic practices, or of nervous  insensibility by the persistent withdrawal of all outer  disturbance; and the mind is fixed upon a single object,--the  one God, the God eternal, absolute, indivisible.  Recalling our  former scheme for the conditions of the sense of personality,  we shall see that we have here the two poles of consciousness.  Then, as the tension is sharpened, what happens?  Under the  artificial conditions of weakened nerves, of blank surroundings,  the self-background drops.  The feeling of transition disappears  with the absence of related terms; and the remaining, the  positive pole of consciousness, is an undifferentiated Unity,  with which the person must feel himself one.  The feeling of  personality is gone with that on which it rests, and its loss  is joined with an overwhelming sense of union with the One, the  Absolute, God!    The object of mystic contemplation is the One indivisible.  But  we can also think the One as the unity of all differences, the  Circle of the Universe.  Those natures also which, like Amiel's,  are \"bedazzled with the Infinite\" and thirst for \"totality\"  attain in their reveries to the same impersonal ecstasy.  Amiel  writes of a \"night on the sandy shore of the North Sea, stretched  at full length upon the beach, my eyes wandering over the Milky  Way.  Will they ever return to me, those grandiose, immortal,  cosmogonic dreams, in which one seems to carry the world in one's  breast, to touch the stars, to possess the Infinite!\"  The  reverie of Senancour, on the bank of the Lake of Bienne, quoted  by Matthew Arnold, reveals the same emotion:  \"Vast consciousness  of a nature everywhere greater than we are, and everywhere  impenetrable; all-embracing passion, ripened wisdom, delicious  self-abandonment.\"  In the coincidence of outer circumstance--  the lake, the North Sea, night, the attitude of repose--may we  not trace a dissolution of the self-background, similar to that  of the mystic worshiper?  And in the Infinite, no less than in  the One, must the soul sink and melt into union with it, because  within it there is no determination, no pause, and no change.    The contemplation of the One, however, is not the only type of  mystic ecstasy.  That intoxication of emotion which seizes upon  the negro camp meeting of to-day, as it did upon the Delphic  priestesses two thousand years ago, seems at first glance to  have nothing in common psychologically with the blessed  nothingness of Gautama and Meister Eckhart.  But the loss of  the feeling of personality and the sense of possession by a  divine spirit are the same. How, then, is this state reached?  By means, I believe, which recall the general formula for the  Disappearance of self-feeling.  To repeat the monosyllable OM  (Brahm) ten thousand times; to circle interminably, chanting  the while, about a sacred ire; to listen to the monotonous  magic drum; to whirl the body about; to rock to and fro on the  knees, vociferating prayers, are methods which enable the  members of the respective sects in which they are practiced  either to enter, as they say, into the Eternal Being, or to  become informed with it through the negation of the self.  The  sense of personality, at any rate, is more or less completely  lost, and the ecstasy takes a form more or less passionate,  according as the worshiper depends on the rapidity rather than  on the monotony of his excitations.  Here, again, the self-  background drops, inasmuch as every rhythmical movement tends  to become automatic, and then unconscious.  Thus what we are  wont to call the inspired madness of the Delphic priestesses  was less the expression of ecstasy than the means of its  excitation.  Perpetual motion, as well as eternal rest, may  bring about the engulfment of the self in the object.  The  most diverse types of religious emotions, IN SO FAR AS THEY  PRESENT VARIATIONS IN THE DEGREE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, are  thus seen to be reducible to the same psychological basis.  The circle, no less than the point, is the symbol of the One,  and the \"devouring unity\" that lays hold on consciousness  from the loss of the feeling of transition comes in the  unrest of enthusiasm no less than in the blissful nothing of  Nirvana.    At this point, I am sure, the reader will interpose a protest.  Is, then, the mystery of self-abandonment to the highest to  be shared with the meanest of fanatics?  Are the rapture of  Dante and the trance of the Omphalopsychi sprung from the  same root?  There is no occasion, however, for the revolt of  sentiment because we fail to emphasize here the important  differences in the emotional character and value of the states  in question.  What interests us is only one aspect which they  have in common, the surrender of the sense of personality.  That is based on formal relations of the elements of  consciousness, and the explanation of its disappearance  applies as well to the whirling dervish as to the converts  of a revivalist preacher.    The mystic, then, need only shut his senses to the world, and  contemplate the One.  Subject fuses with object, and he feels  himself melt into the Infinite.  But each experience is not  the exclusive property of the religious enthusiast.  The  worshiper of beauty has given evidence of the same feelings.  And yet, in his aesthetic rapture, the latter dwells with  deliberation on his delights, and while luxuriating in the  infinite labyrinths of beauty can scarcely be described as  musing on an undifferentiated Unity.  So far, at least, it  does not appear that our formula applies to aesthetic feeling.    Aesthetic feeling arises in the contemplation of a beautiful  object.  But what makes an object beautiful?  To go still  further back, just what, psychologically, does contemplation  mean?  To contemplate an object is to dwell on the idea or  image of it, and to dwell upon an idea means to carry it out  incipiently.  We may go even further, and say it is the  carrying out by virtue of which we grasp the idea.  How do  we think of a tall pine-tree?  By sweeping our eyes up and  down its length, and out to the ends of its branches; and if  we are forbidden to use our eye muscles even infinitesimally,  then we cannot think of the visual image.  In short, we  perceive an object in space by carrying out its motor  suggestions; more technically expressed, by virtue of a  complex of motor impulses aroused by it; more briefly, by  incipiently imitating it.  Contemplation is inner imitation.    Now a beautiful object is first of all a unified object; why  this must be so has been considered in the preceding chapter.  In it all impulses of soul and sense are bound to react upon  one another, and to lead back to one another.  And all the  elements, which in contemplation we reproduce in the form of  motor impulses, are bound to make a closed circle of these  suggested energies.  The symmetrical picture calls out a set  of motor impulses which \"balance,\"--a system of energies  reacting on one centre; the sonnet takes us out on one wave  of rhythm and of thought, to bring us back on another to the  same point; the sonata does the same in melody.  In the  \"whirling circle\" of the drama, not a word or an act that is  not indissolubly linked with before and after.  Thus the unity  of a work of art makes of the system of suggested energies  which form the foreground of attention an impregnable, an  invulnerable circle.    Not only, however, are we held in equilibrium in the object  of attention; we cannot connect with it our self-background,  for the will cannot act on the object of aesthetic feeling.  We cannot eat the grapes of Apelles or embrace the Galatea of  Pygmalion; we cannot rescue Ophelia or enlighten Juliet; and  of impulse to interfere, to connect the scene with ourselves,  we have none.  But this is a less important factor in the  situation.  That the house is dark, the audience silent, and  all motor impulses outside of the aesthetic circle stifled, is,  too, only a superficial, and, so to speak, a negative condition.  The real ground of the possibility of a momentary self-  annihilation lies in the fact that all incitements to motor  impulse--except those which belong to the indissoluble ring  of the object itself--have been shut out by the perfection of  unity to which the aesthetic object (here the drama)"]]]
