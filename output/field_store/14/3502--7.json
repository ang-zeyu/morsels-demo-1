Earthly distinctions will be       but short; but the favour of God will last forever. Besides, is it       a sacrifice to do my duty? Is it not rather a cause of gratitude       that I know my duty, and am allowed to perform it? My heart is       united with the Methodists, my soul is one with theirs; my labours       are acceptable, and they are anxious that I should continue with       them. I believe in their Articles, I approve of their Constitution,       and I believe them to be of the Church of Christ.    _Saltfleet, May 30th._--[Amongst Dr. Ryerson's papers I find the two  following letters. The first addressed from Saltfleet, on this day, to  his brother George; the second to his Mother on the following day.--J.  G. H.]    [To his brother, Rev. George Ryerson, he said: I suppose your first  inquiry is to know my spiritual condition and prospects. As to my  religious enjoyments, I think that I have reason to believe I am daily  blessed with the divine presence to enlighten, to instruct, and to  assist me in my researches and meditations, and in the other arduous  duties I have to discharge. Never did I so sensibly feel the importance  of the work in which I am now engaged, as I have these few days past. I  feel that I am altogether inadequate to it; but God has in a very  special manner, at different times, been my wisdom and strength. I do  not feel sorry that I have commenced travelling as a preacher. I think I  feel more deeply the worth of souls at heart. I feel willing to spend my  all, and be spent in the cause of God, if I may become the unworthy  instrument in doing some good to the souls of men. The greatest  assistance I receive in my public labours, is that which results from a  firm dependence on God for light, life, and power. When I forget this I  am visited with that barrenness of mind, and hardness of heart which are  always the companions of those who live at a distance from God. In  discharging every public duty, my prayer to God is, to renew my  commission afresh, and give me wisdom and energy, and I do not find him  slack concerning his promise. I am striving to pursue my studies with  unabating ardour. My general practice is to retire at ten o'clock, or  before, and rise at five. When I am travelling, I strive to converse no  more than is necessary and useful, endeavouring at all times to keep in  mind the remark of Dr. Clarke, that a preacher's whole business is to  save souls, and that that preacher is the most useful who is the most in  his closet. On my leisure days I read from ten to twenty verses of Greek  a day, besides reading history, the Scriptures, and the best works on  practical divinity, among which Chalmers' has decidedly the preference  in my mind, both for piety and depth of thought. These two last studies  employ the greatest part of my time. My preaching is altogether  original. I endeavour to collect as many ideas from every source as I  can; but I do not copy the expression of any one. For I do detest seeing  blooming flowers in dead men's hands. I think it my duty, and I try to  get a general knowledge, and view of any subject that I discuss  before-hand; but not unfrequently I have tried to preach with only a few  minutes previous reflection. Remember me to my dear Mother, and give her  this letter to read, and tell her that I will write soon.]    _Saltfleet, May 31st._--[To his Mother he writes: My dear Mother, I am  thankful to say that I am well, and am trying in a weak way to serve the  Lord, and persuading as many others to do so as I can. I feel that I am  almost destitute of every necessary qualification for so important a  work. The Lord has blessed me in a very special manner at many different  times. Our prospects are very favourable in some places. Our  congregations are generally large, and still increasing. We have  twenty-four appointments in four weeks. I have formed some very useful  and pious acquaintances since I left home. The Lord seems to be with me,  and renders my feeble efforts acceptable in general. My acquaintance  seems to be sought by all classes, and I try to improve such advantages  in spreading, by my example and conversation, the blessed religion of  Christ among all ranks. I have many temptations to contend with, and  many trials to weigh me down at times. Some of these arise from a sense  of the injustice which I have done to important subjects, on account of  my ignorance, which drives me to a throne of grace, and a closer  application to my studies. My situation is truly a state of trial, and  none but God could support and direct me. And I do feel the comforting  and refreshing influence of his divine power at times very sensibly. I  am determined, by his assistance, never to rest contented until he not  only becomes my wisdom, but my sanctification, and my full redemption.  And blessed be the Lord, my dear Mother, I do feel a hope, and a  confidence that the same divine power and goodness which supports and  comforts you in your ill state of health, and which gives you victory  over your trials, and consolation in your distress, will conduct me,  too, through this stormy maze, and we shall yet have the blessedness of  meeting at our Father's table in Heaven. And God being my helper, my  dear Mother, when you have gone home to rest with God, I am determined  to pursue the same path, which you have strewn with prayers, with tears,  and living faith, until I reach the same blessed port. I hope that you  will pray that the Lord would help and save me forever! If I had no  other inducement to serve God, and walk in the path of religion, but  your comfort, I would try and devote my life to it while I live; but  when Heaven's transcendant glory beams forth in prospective view, my  soul burns to possess the kingdom, and my heart is enlarged for the  salvation of others. I wish you would get George to write immediately,  and let me know the state of your mind, and your opinion about my  returning home, also his own opinion on that subject.--J. G. H.]         _July 2nd._--This week has been a season of trial. I have left my       Father's house once more, and arrived on my Circuit.         _July 3rd.--Sabbath._--I have preached twice to-day in Niagara for       the first time; felt very embarrassed, but my trust was in God, and       my prayer to Him for assistance.         _July 4th._--This evening I have been distressed in mind on account       of leaving my parents. My heart melts within me when I think of my       Father's faltering voice, when lying on his bed he said, \"Good-bye,       Egerton,\" and reached forth his trembling hand, saying by his       countenance that he never expected to see his son a resident in his       house again. He laid himself back in his bed in apparent despair,       no more to enjoy the society of the child he loved. Oh, my God! is       it not too much for humanity? Nature sinks beneath the weight. It       is only God that can sustain. May I endure manfully to the end!         _July 6th and 7th._--I have been much interested in reading Dr.       Coke's discourses, also Wesley's sermons on \"The Kingdom of God.\"         _July 9th._--I have crossed the river to the United States to-day       for the first time. The manners of the people are not pleasant to       me.         _July 10th--Sabbath._--The Lord has greatly blessed me this day. I       have preached three times. My heart overflowed with love for       immortal souls. Many wept, and God's people seemed stirred up to       engage afresh in His service. In the evening, I preached to very a       wicked congregation, from Matt. xvi. 24. My mind was clear,       particularly in argument, but they seemed to be unaffected.         _July 14th._--I have been afflicted with illness, but the Lord has       comforted me. Again had to mourn over light conversation, still I       think I have gained some victory. I am determined to watch and pray       until I obtain a triumph over this trying besetment.         _July 17th._--I felt so ill this morning that I could not attend my       appointment, but recovered so as to preach feebly in the afternoon.       The Word seemed to rest with power on the people.         _July 21st._--For several days I have been much interested in       reading Fletcher's \"Portrait of St. Paul.\" When I compare my       actions and feelings with the standard there laid down, I blush on       account of my ignorance in the duties and labours connected with my       calling. Did the ministers of the Gospel obtain and possess a       deeper communion with God? Did they cultivate primitive piety in       their lives, and Gospel simplicity in their preaching, surely the       power of darkness could not stand before them! How many learned       discourses are entirely lost in the wisdom of words, whereas plain       and simple sermons, delivered with power and demonstration of the       Spirit, have been attended with astonishing success.         _July 27th._--I have been considerably agitated in my mind for the       last two days, having lost my horse. The fatigue in searching for       her has been considerable. Thank God she is found!         _July 31st--Sabbath._--Greatly blessed in attending a Quarterly       meeting in Hamilton; also in hearing an interesting account of the       Indians receiving their presents at York. Peter Jones had written       to Col. Givens to enquire just what time they must be there,       stating that as many of them had become Christianized and       industrious, they did not want to lose time. The Colonel was       surprised at the news, and replied, giving the necessary       information. Peter Jones' letter was shown to Rev. Dr. Strachan and       His Excellency the Governor. It excited great curiosity. When the       Indians arrived, the Colonel had, as usual, brought liquor to treat       them, but as Peter Jones informed him the Christian Indians"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#11)"],[1,"age;  the former was at most but two years older. They loved each other  fervently, and did in concert, all that could lighten, for our  suffering father, the burden of his old age. On Fatima's seventeenth  birthday, my brother prepared a festival. He invited all her  companions, and set before them a choice banquet in the gardens of  our father, and, towards evening, proposed to them to take a little  sail upon the sea, in a boat which he had hired, and adorned in grand  style. Fatima and her companions agreed with joy, for the evening was  fine, and the city, particularly when viewed by evening from the sea,  promised a magnificent prospect. The girls, however, were so well  pleased upon the bark, that they continually entreated my brother to  go farther out upon the sea. Mustapha, however, yielded reluctantly,  because a Corsair had been seen, for several days back, in that  vicinity.    Not far from the city, a promontory projected into the sea; thither  the maidens were anxious to go, in order to see the sun sink into the  water. Having rowed thither, they beheld a boat occupied by armed men.  Anticipating no good, my brother commanded the oarsmen to turn the  vessel, and make for land. His apprehensions seemed, indeed, to be  confirmed, for the boat quickly approached that of my brother, and  getting ahead of it, (for it had more rowers,) ran between it and the  land. The young girls, moreover, when they knew the danger to which  they were exposed, sprang up with cries and lamentations: in vain  Mustapha sought to quiet them, in vain enjoined upon them to be still,  lest their running to and fro should upset the vessel. It was of no  avail; and when, in consequence of the proximity of the other boat,  all ran upon the further side, it was upset.    Meanwhile, they had observed from the land the approach of the strange  boat, and, inasmuch as, for some time back, they had been in anxiety  on account of Corsairs, their suspicions were excited, and several  boats put off from the land to their assistance: but they only came in  time to pick up the drowning. In the confusion, the hostile boat  escaped. In both barks, however, which had taken in those who were  preserved, they were uncertain whether all had been saved. They  approached each other, and, alas! found that my sister and one of her  companions were missing; at the same time, in their number a stranger  was discovered, who was known to none. In answer to Mustapha's  threats, he confessed that he belonged to the hostile ship, which was  lying at anchor two miles to the eastward, and that his companions had  left him behind in their hasty flight, while he was engaged in  assisting to pick up the maidens; moreover, he said he had seen two  taken on board their boat.    The grief of my old father was without bounds, but Mustapha also was  afflicted unto death, for not only had his beloved sister been lost,  and did he accuse himself of having been the cause of her misfortune,  but, also, her companion who had shared it with her, had been promised  to him by her parents as his wife; still had he not dared to avow it  to our father, because her family was poor, and of low descent. My  father, however, was a stern man; as soon as his sorrow had subsided a  little, he called Mustapha before him, and thus spake to him:--    \"Thy folly has deprived me of the consolation of my old age, and the  joy of my eyes. Go! I banish thee forever from my sight! I curse thee  and thine offspring--and only when thou shalt restore to me my Fatima,  shall thy head be entirely free from a father's execrations!\"    This my poor brother had not expected; already, before this, he had  determined to go in search of his sister and her friend, after having  asked the blessing of his father upon his efforts, and now that father  had sent him forth into the world, laden with his curse. As, however,  his former grief had bowed him down, so this consummation of  misfortune, which he had not deserved, tended to steel his mind. He  went to the imprisoned pirate, and, demanding whither the ship was  bound, learned that she carried on a trade in slaves, and usually had  a great sale thereof in Balsora.    On his return to the house, in order to prepare for his journey, the  anger of his father seemed to have subsided a little, for he sent him  a purse full of gold, to support him during his travels. Mustapha,  thereupon, in tears took leave of the parents of Zoraida, (for so his  affianced was called,) and set out upon the route to Balsora.    Mustapha travelled by land, because from our little city there was no  ship that went direct to Balsora. He was obliged, therefore, to use  all expedition, in order not to arrive too long after the sea-robbers.  Having a good horse and no luggage, he hoped to reach this city by the  end of the sixth day. On the evening of the fourth, however, as he  was riding all alone upon his way, three men came suddenly upon him.  Having observed that they were well-armed and powerful men, and sought  his money and his horse, rather than his life, he cried out that he  would yield himself to them. They dismounted, and tied his feet  together under his horse; then they placed him in their midst, and,  without a word spoken, trotted quickly away with him; one of them  having seized his bridle.    Mustapha gave himself up to a feeling of gloomy despair; the curse of  his father seemed already to be undergoing its accomplishment on the  unfortunate one, and how could he hope to save his sister and Zoraida,  should he, robbed of all his means, even be able to devote his poor  life to their deliverance? Mustapha and his silent companions might  have ridden about an hour, when they entered a little valley. The vale  was enclosed by lofty trees; a soft, dark-green turf, and a stream  which ran swiftly through its midst, invited to repose. In this place  were pitched from fifteen to twenty tents, to the stakes of which were  fastened camels and fine horses: from one of these tents distinctly  sounded the melody of a guitar, blended with two fine manly voices. It  seemed to my brother as if people who had chosen so blithesome a  resting-place, could have no evil intentions towards himself; and  accordingly, without apprehension, he obeyed the summons of his  conductors, who had unbound his feet, and made signs to him to follow.  They led him into a tent which was larger than the rest, and on the  inside was magnificently fitted up. Splendid cushions embroidered with  gold, woven carpets, gilded censers, would elsewhere have bespoken  opulence and respectability, but here seemed only the booty of a  robber band. Upon one of the cushions an old and small-sized man was  reclining: his countenance was ugly; a dark-brown and shining skin, a  disgusting expression around his eyes, and a mouth of malicious  cunning, combined to render his whole appearance odious. Although this  man sought to put on a commanding air, still Mustapha soon perceived  that not for him was the tent so richly adorned, and the conversation  of his conductors seemed to confirm him in his opinion.    \"Where is the Mighty?\" inquired they of the little man.    \"He is out upon a short hunt,\" was the answer; \"but he has  commissioned me to attend to his affairs.\"    \"That has he not wisely done,\" rejoined one of the robbers; \"for it  must soon be determined whether this dog is to die or be ransomed, and  that the Mighty knows better than thou.\"    Being very sensitive in all that related to his usurped dignity, the  little man, raising himself, stretched forward in order to reach the  other's ear with the extremity of his hand, for he seemed desirous of  revenging himself by a blow; but when he saw that his attempt was  fruitless, he set about abusing him (and indeed the others did not  remain much in his debt) to such a degree, that the tent resounded  with their strife. Thereupon, of a sudden, the tent-door opened, and  in walked a tall, stately man, young and handsome as a Persian prince.  His garments and weapons, with the exception of a richly-mounted  poniard and gleaming sabre, were plain and simple; his serious eye,  however, and his whole appearance, demanded respect without exciting  fear.    \"Who is it that dares to engage in strife within my tent?\" exclaimed  he, as they started back aghast. For a long time deep stillness  prevailed, till at last one of those who had captured Mustapha,  related to him how it had begun. Thereupon the countenance of \"the  Mighty,\" as they had called him, seemed to grow red with passion.    \"When would I have placed thee, Hassan, over my concerns?\" he cried,  in frightful accents, to the little man. The latter, in his fear,  shrunk until he seemed even smaller than before, and crept towards the  door of the tent. One step of the Mighty was sufficient to send him  through the entrance with a long singular bound. As soon as the little  man had vanished, the three led Mustapha before the master of the  tent, who had meanwhile reclined upon the cushion.    \"Here bring we thee him, whom thou commandedst us to take.\" He  regarded the prisoner for some time, and then said, \"Bashaw of  Sulieika, thine own conscience will tell thee why thou standest before  Orbasan.\" When my brother heard this, he bowed low and answered:--    \"My lord, you appear to labor under a mistake; I am a poor  unfortunate, not the Bashaw, whom you seek.\" At this all were amazed;  the master of the tent, however, said:--    \"Dissimulation can help you little, for I will summon the people who  know you well.\" He commanded them to bring in Zuleima. An old woman  was led into the tent, who, on being asked whether in my brother she  recognised the Bashaw of Sulieika, answered:--    \"Yes, verily! And I swear by the grave of the Prophet, it is the  Bashaw, and no other!\"    \"Seest thou, wretch, that thy dissimulation has become as water?\"  cried out the Mighty in a furious tone. \"Thou art too pitiful"]]]
