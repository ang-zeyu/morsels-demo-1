This was reserved for Farmer, for Steevens, for Malone, for       Chalmers, Reed and Douce: and it is expressly to these       latter gentlemen (for Johnson and Hanmer were very sparing,       or very shy, of the black letter), that we are indebted for       the present spirit of research into the works of our       ancestors.         The sale of the books lasted 50 days. There was a second       sale of pamphlets, books of prints, &c., in the following       year, which lasted 10 days; and this was immediately       succeeded by a sale of the Doctor's single prints and       drawings, which continued 8 days.]         [Footnote 41: This gentleman's library, not so remarkable       for the black letter as for whimsical publications, was sold       by auction, by Samuel Paterson, [the earliest sale in which       I find this well known book-auctioneer engaged] in June,       1759, and the three ensuing evenings. The title of the Sale       Catalogue is as follows:         \"A Catalogue of the original MSS. and manuscript collections       of the late Reverend Mr. JOHN HENLEY, A.M., Independent       Minister of the Oratory, &c., in which are included sundry       collections of the late Mons. des Maizeaux, the learned       editor of Bayle, &c., Mr. Lowndes, author of the Report for       the Amendment of Silver Coins, &c., Dr. Patrick Blair,       Physician at Boston, and F.R.S. &c., together with original       letters and papers of State, addressed to Henry d'Avenant,       Esq., her Britannic Majesty's Envoy at Francfort, from 1703       to 1708 inclusive.\"         Few libraries have contained more curious and remarkable       publications than did this. The following articles, given as       notable specimens, remind us somewhat of Addison's Memoranda       for the Spectator, which the waiter at the coffee-house       picked up and read aloud for the amusement of the company.

Of ORATOR HENLEY I have not been able to collect any       biographical details more interesting than those which are       to be found in Warburton's notes to Pope's Dunciad.]    We are now, my dear Sir, descending rapidly to our own times; and, in  a manner sufficiently rough, have traced the _History of the  Bibliomania_ to the commencement of the present illustrious reign:  when we discover, among its victims, a General, who had probably  faced many a cannon, and stormed many a rampart, uninjured. The name  of Dormer[42] will remind you of the small but choice library which  affords such a melancholy proof of its owners' fate; while the more  splendid examples of Smith[43] and West[44] serve to shew the  increased ravages of a disease, which seemed to threaten the lives of  all, into whose ears (like those of \"Visto,\") some demon had  \"whispered\" the sound of \"TASTE.\" These three striking instances of  the fatality of the Bibliomania occurred--the first in the year 1764;  and the latter in 1773. The following year witnessed the sale of the  Fletewode[45] library; so that nothing but despair and havoc appeared  to move in the train of this pestiferous malady. In the year 1775 died  the famous Dr. Anthony Askew, another illustrious victim to the  Bibliomania. Those who recollect the zeal and scholarship of this  great book-collector, and the precious gems with which his library[46]  was stored from the cabinets of De Boze and Gaignat, as well as of  Mead and Folkes, cannot but sigh with grief of heart on the thought  of such a victim! How ardently, and how kindly [as I remember to have  heard his friend Dr. Burges say], would Askew unfold his glittering  stores--open the magnificent folio, or the shining duodecimo, UPON  VELLUM, embossed and fast held together with golden knobs and silver  clasps! How carefully would he unroll the curious MS.--decipher the  half effaced characters--and then, casting an eye of ecstacy over the  shelves upon which similar treasures were lodged, exult in the  glittering prospect before him! But death--who, as Horace tells us,  raps equally at the palaces of kings and cottages of peasants, made  no scruple to exercise the knocker of the Doctor's door, and sent, as  his avant-courier, THIS DEPLORABLE MANIA! It appeared; and even Askew,  with all his skill in medicine and books, fell lifeless before  it--bewailed, as he was beloved and respected!         [Footnote 42: \"A Catalogue of the genuine and elegant       Library of the late Sir C.C. DORMER, collected by       Lieutenant-General James Dormer, which will be sold, &c., by       Samuel Baker, at his house in York Street, Covent Garden; to       begin on Monday, February the 20th, 1764, and to continue       the nineteen following evenings.\" At the end of the       catalogue we are told that the books were \"in general of the       best editions, and in the finest condition, many of them in       _large paper_, bound in morocco, gilt leaves, &c.\"         This was a very choice collection of books, consisting       almost entirely of Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish and       French. The number of articles did not exceed 3082, and of       volumes, probably not 7000. The catalogue is neatly printed,       and copies of it on _large paper_ are exceedingly scarce.       Among the most curious and valuable articles were those       numbered 599, 604, 2249, 2590; from no. 2680, to the end,       was a choice collection of Italian and Spanish books.]         [Footnote 43: In the year 1755 was published at Venice,       printed by J.B. Pasquali, a catalogue of the books of JOSEPH       SMITH, Esq., Consul at Venice.         The catalogue was published under the following Latin title:       \"Bibliotheca Smitheana, seu Catalogus Librorum D. Josephi       Smithii, Angli, per Cognomina Authorum dispositus, Venetiis,       typis Jo. Baptistae Pasquali, M,DCCLV.;\" in quarto; with the       arms of Consul Smith. The title page is succeeded by a Latin       preface of Pasquali, and an alphabetical list of 43 pages of       the authors mentioned in the catalogue: then follow the       books arranged alphabetically, without any regard to size,       language, or subject. These occupy 519 pages, marked with       the Roman numerals; after which are 66 pages, numbered in       the same manner, of \"addenda et corrigenda.\" The most       valuable part of the volume is \"The Prefaces and Epistles       prefixed to those works in the Library which were printed in       the 15th century:\" these occupy 348 pages. A Catalogue, (in       three pages) of the Names of the illustrious Men mentioned       in these prefaces, &c., closes the book.         It would be superfluous to mention to bibliographers the       rare articles contained in this collection, which are so       generally known and so justly appreciated. They consist       chiefly of early editions of _Italian_, _Greek_, and _Latin       classics_; and of many copies of both printed UPON VELLUM.       The library, so rich in these articles, was, however,       defective in English Literature and Antiquities. There was       scarcely any thing of Shakspeare or Dugdale.         On the death of Mr. Smith in 1772, his collection was sold       in 1773, 8vo., by Baker and Leigh; and the books were       announced to the public, as being \"in the finest       preservation, and consisting of the very best and scarcest       editions of the Latin, Italian, and French authors, from the       invention of printing; with manuscripts and missals, upon       vellum, finely illuminated.\" A glance upon the prices for       which most of these fine books were sold made Mr. Cuthell       exclaim, in my hearing, that \"_they were given away_.\" On       these occasions, one cannot help now and then wishing, with       father Evander,              \"O mihi praeteritos referat si Jupiter annos!\"         On comparing Pasquali's, with the sale, catalogue, it will       be obvious that a great number of rare and valuable articles       was disposed of before the books came to public auction.       Indeed it is known that his present MAJESTY enriched his       magnificent collection with many of the Consul's _first       editions_, and _vellum copies_, during the life of the       latter. The sale continued thirteen days only; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#11)"],[1,"tubes passing from  end to end of it. The exhaust gases pouring into the box maintain a  constant pressure somewhat higher than that of the atmosphere, but as  the gases are escaping from it in a fairly steady stream the noise  becomes a gentle hiss rather than a \"pop.\" There are numerous types of  silencers, but all employ this principle in one form or another.      THE BRAKES.    Every car carries at least two brakes of band pattern--one, usually  worked by a side hand-lever, acting on the axle or hubs of the  driving-wheel; the other, operated by the foot, acting on the  transmission gear (see Fig. 48). The latter brake is generally arranged  to withdraw the clutch simultaneously. Tests have proved that even heavy  cars can be pulled up in astonishingly short distances, considering  their rate of travel. Trials made in the United States with a touring  car and a four-in-hand coach gave 25-1/3 and 70 feet respectively for  the distance in which the speed could be reduced from sixteen miles per  hour to zero.      SPEED OF CARS.    As regards speed, motor cars can rival the fastest express trains, even  on long journeys. In fact, feats performed during the Gordon-Bennett and  other races have equalled railway performances over equal distances.  When we come to record speeds, we find a car, specially built for the  purpose, covering a mile in less than half a minute. A speed of over 120  miles an hour has actually been reached. Engines of 150 h.p. can now be  packed into a vehicle scaling less than 1-1/2 tons. Even on touring cars  are often found engines developing 40 to 60 h.p., which force the car up  steep hills at a pace nothing less than astonishing. In the future the  motor car will revolutionize our modes of life to an extent comparable  to the changes effected by the advent of the steam-engine. Even since  1896, when the \"man-with-the-flag\" law was abolished in the British  Isles, the motor has reduced distances, opened up country districts, and  generally quickened the pulses of the community in a manner which makes  it hazardous to prophesy how the next generation will live.    _Note._--The author is much indebted to Mr. Wilfrid J. Lineham, M. Inst.  C.E., for several of the illustrations which appear in the above  chapter.      [8] Steam-driven cars are not considered in this chapter, as their  principle is much the same as that of the ordinary locomotive.    [9] On some cars natural circulation is used, the hot water flowing from  the top of the cylinder to the tank, from which it returns, after being  cooled, to the bottom of the cylinder.

WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?    Of the ultimate nature of electricity, as of that of heat and light, we  are at present ignorant. But it has been clearly established that all  three phenomena are but manifestations of the energy pervading the  universe. By means of suitable apparatus one form can be converted into  another form. The heat of fuel burnt in a boiler furnace develops  mechanical energy in the engine which the boiler feeds with steam. The  engine revolves a dynamo, and the electric current thereby generated can  be passed through wires to produce mechanical motion, heat, or light. We  must remain content, therefore, with assuming that electricity is energy  or motion transmitted through the ether from molecule to molecule, or  from atom to atom, of matter. Scientific investigation has taught us how  to produce it at will, how to harness it to our uses, and how to measure  it; but not _what_ it is. That question may, perhaps, remain unanswered  till the end of human history. A great difficulty attending the  explanation of electrical action is this--that, except in one or two  cases, no comparison can be established between it and the operation of  gases and fluids. When dealing with the steam-engine, any ordinary  intelligence soon grasps the principles which govern the use of steam in  cylinders or turbines. The diagrams show, it is hoped, quite plainly  \"how it works.\" But electricity is elusive, invisible; and the greatest  authorities cannot say what goes on at the poles of a magnet or on the  surface of an electrified body. Even the existence of \"negative\" and  \"positive\" electricity is problematical. However, we see the effects,  and we know that if one thing is done another thing happens; so that we  are at least able to use terms which, while convenient, are not at  present controverted by scientific progress.      FORMS OF ELECTRICITY.    Rub a vulcanite rod and hold one end near some tiny pieces of paper.  They fly to it, stick to it for a time, and then fall off. The rod was  electrified--that is, its surface was affected in such a way as to be in  a state of molecular strain which the contact of the paper fragments  alleviated. By rubbing large surfaces and collecting the electricity in  suitable receivers the strain can be made to relieve itself in the form  of a violent discharge accompanied by a bright flash. This form of  electricity is known as _static_.    Next, place a copper plate and a zinc plate into a jar full of diluted  sulphuric acid. If a wire be attached to them a current of electricity  is said to _flow_ along the wire. We must not, however, imagine that  anything actually moves along inside the wire, as water, steam, or air,  passes through a pipe. Professor Trowbridge says,[11] \"No other agency  for transmitting power can be stopped by such slight obstacles as  electricity. A thin sheet of paper placed across a tube conveying  compressed air would be instantly ruptured. It would take a wall of  steel at least an inch thick to stand the pressure of steam which is  driving a 10,000 horse-power engine. A thin layer of dirt beneath the  wheels of an electric car can prevent the current which propels the car  from passing to the rail, and then back to the power-house.\" There  would, indeed, be a puncture of the paper if the current had a  sufficient voltage, or pressure; yet the fact remains that _current_  electricity can be very easily confined to its conductor by means of  some insulating or nonconducting envelope.      MAGNETISM.    The most familiar form of electricity is that known as magnetism. When a  bar of steel or iron is magnetized, it is supposed that the molecules in  it turn and arrange themselves with all their north-seeking poles  towards the one end of the bar, and their south-seeking poles towards  the other. If the bar is balanced freely on a pivot, it comes to rest  pointing north and south; for, the earth being a huge magnet, its north  pole attracts all the north-seeking poles of the molecules, and its  south poles the south-seeking poles. (The north-_seeking_ pole of a  magnet is marked N., though it is in reality the _south_ pole; for  unlike poles are mutually attractive, and like poles repellent.)    There are two forms of magnet--_permanent_ and _temporary_. If steel is  magnetized, it remains so; but soft iron loses practically all its  magnetism as soon as the cause of magnetization is withdrawn. This is  what we should expect; for steel is more closely compacted than iron,  and the molecules therefore would be able to turn about more easily.[12]  It is fortunate for us that this is so, since on the rapid magnetization  and demagnetization of soft iron depends the action of many of our  electrical mechanisms.      THE PERMANENT MAGNET.    Magnets are either (1) straight, in which case they are called bar  magnets; or (2) of horseshoe form, as in Figs. 50 and 51. By bending the  magnet the two poles are brought close together, and the attraction of  both may be exercised simultaneously on a bar of steel or iron.      LINES OF FORCE.    In Fig. 50 are seen a number of dotted lines. These are called _lines of  magnetic force_. If you lay a sheet of paper on a horseshoe magnet and  sprinkle it with iron dust, you will at once notice how the particles  arrange themselves in curves similar in shape to those shown in the  illustration. It is supposed (it cannot be _proved_) that magnetic force  streams away from the N. pole and describes a circular course through  the air back to the S. pole. The same remark applies to the bar magnet.      ELECTRICAL MAGNETS.    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Permanent magnet, and the \"lines of force\"  emanating from it.]    If an insulated wire is wound round and round a steel or iron bar from  end to end, and has its ends connected to the terminals of an electric  battery, current rotates round the bar, and the bar is magnetized. By  increasing the strength and volume of the current, and multiplying the  number of turns of wire, the attractive force of the magnet is  increased. Now disconnect the wires from the battery. If of iron, the  magnet at once loses its attractive force; but if of steel, it retains  it in part. Instead of a simple horseshoe-shaped bar, two shorter bars  riveted into a plate are generally used for electromagnets of this type.  Coils of wire are wound round each bar, and connected so as to form one  continuous whole; but the wire of one coil is wound in the direction  opposite to that of the other. The free end of each goes to a battery  terminal.    In Fig. 51 you will notice that some of the \"lines of force\" are  deflected through the iron bar A. They pass more easily through iron  than through air; and will choose iron by preference. The attraction  exercised by a magnet on iron may be due to the effort of the lines of  force to shorten their paths. It is evident that the closer A comes to  the poles of the magnet the less will be the distance to be travelled  from one pole to the bar, along it, "]]]
