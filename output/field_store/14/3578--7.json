XVIII. 15.    7. _Distentio mamularum._ The distention of the nipples of lactescent women  is at first owing to the stimulus of the milk. See Sect. XIV. 8. and Sect.  XVI. 5. See Class II. 1. 7. 10.    8. _Descensus uteri._ This is a very frequent complaint after bad labours,  the fundus uteri becomes inverted and descends like the prolapsus ani.    M. M. All the usual pessaries are very inconvenient and ineffectual. A  piece of soft sponge about two inches diameter introduced into the vagina  gives great ease to these patients, and supports the uterus; it should have  a string put through it to retract it by.    There are also pessaries now made of elastic gum, which are said to be  easily worn, and to be convenient, from their having a perforation in their  centre.    9. _Prolapsus ani._ The lower part of the rectum becomes inverted, and  descends after every stool chiefly in children; and thus stimulates the  sphincter ani like any other extraneous body.    M. M. It should be dusted over with very fine powder of gum sandarach, and  then replaced. Astringent fomentations; as an infusion of oak-bark, or a  slight solution of alum. Horizontal rest frequently in the day.    10. _Lumbricus._ Round worm. The round worm is suspected in children when  the belly is tumid, and the countenance bloated and pale, with swelling of  the upper lip. The generation of these worms is promoted by the too dilute  state of the bile, as is evident in the fleuke-worm found in the biliary  ducts and substance of the liver in sheep; and in water-rats, in the livers  of which last animals they were lately detected in large numbers by Dr.  Capelle. Transactions of the college at Philadelphia, v. i.    Now as the dilute state of the bile depends on the deficiency of the  absorption of its thinner parts, it appears, that the tumid belly, and  bloated countenance, and swelled upper lip, are a concomitant circumstance  attending the general inactivity of the absorbent system; which is  therefore to be esteemed the remote cause of the generation of worms.    The simplicity of the structure of worms probably enables them to exist in  more various temperatures of heat; and their being endued with life  prevents them from being destroyed by digestion in the stomach, probably in  the same manner as the powers of life prevent the fermentation and  putrefaction of the stomach itself. Hence I conclude, that worms are  originally taken into our alimentary canal from without; as I believe  similar worms of all kinds are to be found out of the body.    M. M. The round worm is destroyed by a cathartic with four or six grains of  calomel; and afterwards by giving six or eight grains of filings of iron  twice a day for a fortnight. See Hepatis tumor, Class I. 2. 3. 9. As worms  are liable to come away in fevers, whether of the hectic or putrid kind,  could they be removed by purulent matter, or rotten egg, or putrid flesh,  since in those fevers from the enfeebled action of the intestines the  faeces become highly putrid?    11. _Taenia._ Tape-worm consists of a chain of animals extending from the  stomach to the anus. See Sect. XXXIX. 2. 3. It frequently exists in cats,  rats, and geese, and probably in many other animals.    The worms of this genus possess a wonderful power of retaining life. Two of  them, which were voided by a pointer dog in consequence of violent  purgatives, each of which were several feet in length, had boiling water  poured on them in a bason; which seemed not much to inconvenience them.  When the water was cool, they were taken out and put into gin or whiskey of  the strongest kind, in which their life and activity continued unimpaired;  and they were at length killed by adding to the spirit a quantity of  corrosive sublimate. Medic. Comment. for 1791, p. 370.    The tape-worm is cured by an amalgama of tin and quicksilver, such as is  used on the back of looking-glasses; an ounce should be taken every two  hours, till a pound is taken; and then a brisk cathartic of Glauber's salt  two ounces, and common salts one ounce, dissolved in two wine pints of  water, half a pint to be taken every hour till it purges. The worm extends  from the stomach to the anus, and the amalgama tears it from the intestine  by mechanical pressure, acting upon it the whole way. Electric shocks  through the duodenum greatly assists the operation. Large doses of tin in  powder. Iron filings in large doses. The powder of fern-root seems to be of  no use, as recommended by M. Noufflier.    12. _Ascarides._ Thread-worms. These worms are said to be more frequent in  some parts of this kingdom than in others, as near the fens of  Lincolnshire. Do they escape from the body and become flies, like the  bott-worm in horses? Do they crawl from one child to another in the same  bed? Are they acquired from flies or worms, which are seen in putrid  necessary houses, as these worms as well as the tapeworms, are probably  acquired from without? this may account for their re-appearance a few weeks  or months after they have been destroyed; or can this happen from the eggs  or parts of them remaining?    Ascarides appear to be of two kinds, the common small ones like a thread;  which has a very sharp head, as appears in the microscope; and which is so  tender, that the cold air soon renders it motionless; and a larger kind  above an inch long, and nearly as thick as a very small crow-quill, and  which is very hard in respect to its texture, and very tenacious of life.  One of these last was brought to me, and was immediately immersed in a  strong solution of sugar of lead, and lived in it a very long time without  apparent inconvenience.    M. M. Ascarides are said to be weakened by twenty grains of cinnabar and  five of rhubarb taken every night, but not to be cured by this process. As  these worms are found only in the rectum, variety of clysters have been  recommended. I was informed of a case, where solutions of mercurial  ointment were used as a clyster every night for a month without success.  Clysters of Harrowgate water are recomended, either of the natural, or of  the factitious, as described below, which might have a greater proportion  of liver of sulphur in it. As the cold air soon destroys them, after they  are voided, could clysters of iced water be used with advantage? or of  spirit of wine and water? or of ether and water? Might not a piece of  candle, about an inch long, or two such pieces, smeared with mercurial  ointment, and introduced into the anus at night, or twice a day, be  effectual by compressing their nidus, as well as by the poison of the  mercury.    The clysters should be large in quantity, that they may pass high in the  rectum, as two drams of tobacco boiled a minute in a pint of water. Or  perhaps what might be still more efficacious and less inconvenient, the  smoke of tobacco injected by a proper apparatus every night, or alternate  nights, for six or eight weeks. This was long since recommended, I think by  Mr. Turner of Liverpool; and the reason it has not succeeded, I believe to  have been owing to the imperfections of the joints of the common apparatus  for injecting the smoke of tobacco, so that it did not pass into the  intestine, though it was supposed to do so, as I once observed. The smoke  should be received from the apparatus into a large bladder; and it may then  be certainly injected like the common clyster with sufficient force;  otherwise oiled leathers should be nicely put round the joints of the  machine; and a wet cloth round the injecting pipe to prevent the return of  the smoke by the sides of it. Clysters of carbonated hydrogen gas, or of  other factitious airs, might be tried.    Harrowgate water taken into the stomach, so as to induce six or seven  stools every morning, for four or six weeks, is perhaps the most  efficacious method in common use. A factitious Harrowgate water may be made  probably of greater efficacy than the natural, by dissolving one ounce of  marine salt, (called bay salt) and half an ounce of magnesia Glauber's  salt, (called Epsom salt, or bitter purging salt) in twenty-eight ounces of  water. A quarter or half a pint of this is to be taken every hour, or two  hours in the morning, till it operates, with a tea-spoonful of a solution  of liver of sulphur, which is to be made by putting an ounce of hepar  sulphuris into half a pint of water. See Class IV. 1. 2. 9.    13. _Dracunculus._ A thin worm brought from the coast of Guinea. It is  found in the interstices of the muscles, and is many yards long; it makes a  small ulcer; which is cured by extracting an inch of the worm a day, and  wrapping the extracted part slowly round a bit of tobacco pipe till next  day, so as not to break it. I have twice seen long worms, like a thick  horse-hair, in water in July in this country, which appeared hard and  jointed.    14. _Morpiones._ Crab-lice. The excrement of this animal stains the linen,  and appears like diluted blood.    M. M. Spirit of wine. Mercurial ointment, shaving the part. Oil destroys  other insects, if they be quite covered with it, as the ticks on dogs, and  would probably therefore destroy these. Its manner of operation is by  stopping up or filling their spiracula, or breathing pores; a few drops of  oil poured on a wasp, so as to cover it, destroys it in a few seconds.    15. _Pediculi._ Lice. There is said to be a disease, in which these animals  are propagated in indestructible numbers, so as to destroy the patient.    M. M. Cleanliness, mercurial ointment, stavis acria in powder, or the  tincture of it in spirit of wine. Spirit of wine alone? Bath of oil?           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO I.    _Increased Irritation._    GENUS V.    _With Increased Actions"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27638"],[0,"The 2001 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"mine removal, and a wide range of aid to refugees  and displaced persons    Currency: afghani (AFA)    Currency code: AFA    Exchange rates: afghanis per US dollar - 4,700 (January 2000), 4,750  (February 1999), 17,000 (December 1996), 7,000 (January 1995), 1,900  (January 1994), 1,019 (March 1993), 850 (1991); note - these rates  reflect the free market exchange rates rather than the official  exchange rate, which was fixed at 50.600 afghanis to the dollar  until 1996, when it rose to 2,262.65 per dollar, and finally became  fixed again at 3,000.00 per dollar in April 1996    Fiscal year: 21 March - 20 March        Afghanistan    Communications    Telephones - main lines in use: 29,000 (1996)    note:  there were 21,000 main lines in service in Kabul in 1998    Telephones - mobile cellular: NA    Telephone system: general assessment:  very limited telephone and  telegraph service    domestic:  in 1997, telecommunications links were established  between Mazar-e Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad, and Kabul  through satellite and microwave systems    international:  satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean)  linked only to Iran and 1 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region);  commercial satellite telephone center in Ghazni    Radio broadcast stations: AM 7 (6 are inactive; the active station  is in Kabul), FM 1, shortwave 1 (broadcasts in Pushtu, Dari, Urdu,  and English) (1999)    Radios: 167,000 (1999)    Television broadcast stations: at least 10 (one government run  central television station in Kabul and regional stations in nine of  the 30 provinces; the regional stations operate on a reduced  schedule; also, in 1997, there was a station in Mazar-e Sharif  reaching four northern Afghanistan provinces) (1998)    Televisions: 100,000 (1999)    Internet country code: .af    Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 1 (2000)    Internet users: NA        Afghanistan    Transportation    Railways: total:  24.6 km    broad gauge:  9.6 km 1.524-m gauge from Gushgy (Turkmenistan) to  Towraghondi; 15 km 1.524-m gauge from Termiz (Uzbekistan) to  Kheyrabad transshipment point on south bank of Amu Darya    Highways: total:  21,000 km    paved:  2,793 km    unpaved:  18,207 km (1998 est.)

The transition has  proven difficult as corrupt governments have tried to deal with high  unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure, widespread gangsterism,  and disruptive political opponents. International observers judged  local elections in 2000 to be acceptable and a step toward  democratic development, but serious deficiencies remain to be  corrected before the the 2001 parliamentary elections.
