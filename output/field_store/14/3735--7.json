It is said by classic writers that the spindle was always, when  in use, accompanied by the distaff, as \"an indispensable part of the  apparatus.\" The following particulars are gathered from Homer, Herodotus,  Ovid, Horace, Catullus, Pliny, and others: The spindle was a stick, ten or  twelve inches long, having at the top a slit or notch, by which to fix the  thread at the commencement; the lower end was passed through and attached  to a small but heavy disc or whirl, made of wood, stone, or metal. The  weight of this and of the spindle, kept the thread at a proper tension, and  the momentum while turning round kept the yarn or thread twisting in the  interval of repeating the operation with the fingers. When, from the length  of the thread, the spindle approached the ground, or descended below the  reach of the fingers, the thread was wound on the spindle, except a short  piece left for insertion in the slit, preparatory to the formation of  another length. The distaff was about three times as long as the spindle,  and commonly made of a reed, with an expansion near the top, over which the  prepared flax or wool was placed, and secured by a ribbon or tape; the  fibres being left sufficiently loose to be easily drawn out by the fingers  and thumb of the spinner. Distaffs as well as spindles of gold and of ivory  were ascribed to goddesses, and were presented to distinguished women.    It was quite common for ancient females to keep their spindles whirling  while on their way to the fountain for water, or in making short visits,  &c. Some striking examples have been recorded by historians, and among them  the following, by Herodotus: \"As Darius, king of Persia, was sitting  publicly in one of the streets of Sardis, he observed a young woman of  great elegance and beauty, bearing a vessel on her head, leading a horse by  a bridle fastened round her arm, and at the same time spinning some thread.  Darius viewed her as she passed, with intense curiosity, observing that her  employments were not those of a Persian, Lydian, nor indeed of any Asiatic  female. Prompted by what he had seen, he sent some of his attendants to  observe what she did with the horse. They accordingly followed her. When  she came to the river, she gave the horse some water, and then filled her  pitcher, and having done this, she returned by the way she came, with the  pitcher of water on her head, the horse fastened by a bridle to her arm,  and, as before, employed in spinning.\"    [Illustration: Distaff and Spindle--Modern Asiatic and European.]    In the rural districts of old Rome, women were forbidden to spin while  travelling on foot. The prohibition arose from superstitious feelings; but  the practice has come down to our times, being found more or less common in  Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Greece, and other parts of Europe, as also  over the greater part of Asia. The shank of the distaff on such occasions  was secured by a sheath or strap to the person; or, as in the preceding  figure of a modern spinner, was held under the left arm.    How differently the idea has been worked out by the ancient inhabitants of  this hemisphere, will appear in the two next illustrations. They are coarse  and uncouth, yet of unusual interest and value in an historical survey of a  people who at the Conquest stood at the head of the aborigines, but whose  nationality and power have been broken, and whose arts have all but  vanished before those introduced by the whites.    [Illustration: Aztec Girl Spinning. From Mendoza's Collection.]    The figure represents a girl, six years old, learning to spin, in the  presence of her mother, whose portrait is omitted. She is in the act of  winding on the spindle the length of thread just spun. The spindle differs  but little from those of the eastern races, its lower end being furnished  with a conical weight or fly, to promote rotation, and, as it would seem,  for its pointed extremity to rest like a pivot in some small cavity while  revolving; for the spindle, when in use, was not raised from the ground:  the reverse of the eastern practice, in which the motion ceased the moment  the ground was touched by the spindle. The basket-like base on which the  fly rests, is the Mexican symbol of the ground, though possibly it may here  represent an implement or utensil also. The bunch of cotton to be spun,  after being suitably prepared, was held in the left hand, and the length of  thread formed at one operation was determined by the distance the bunch  could be drawn away from the spindle, this being also the converse of the  Asiatic and European practices, in which the distaff, and cotton on it, are  at rest--the length of thread depending on the descent of the spindle from  them. We know that domestic industry was strictly enforced by the Mexicans,  particularly on girls; and of this, these cuts are remarkable  illustrations.    In the next, a female adult (as the headdress shows) is portrayed at the  moment when a full length of thread has been twisted, or she is in the act  of finishing it. To this spindle _two_ conical weights were attached,  unless the under one was fixed and had a cavity on the top to admit the  point of the upper one to play in it. The process differs but little from  that of the present Pimos and Maricopas tribes, as mentioned hereafter,  except in the hollow in which the spindle turns. It is obvious that this  practice is incompatible with walking; locomotion can only be associated  with a spindle suspended by the thread, and whirling free above the ground.  In this absence of the distaff, and especially in twirling the spindle like  a top _on the floor_, the process can never be viewed as one derived from  abroad; but rather as a result solely of primitive ingenuity. No people,  civilized or savage, of the eastern hemisphere, are known to have thus  embarrassed the movements of the spindle. The idea and the practice appear  to be purely American. No ancient American spinner is represented at work  either when seated or standing--much less when walking.    [Illustration: Aztec Woman Spinning. From Mendoza's Collection.]    For the following illustration and description the patent office is  indebted to Mr. Squier, late United States Charge to Nicaragua. It is  interesting as showing how little the old native process has been changed.    The common foot-wheel is extensively used in spinning cotton in Nicaragua;  but the simple contrivance in use before the Conquest is not yet entirely  supplanted. It consists of a spindle of hard wood, sixteen or eighteen  inches in length, which passes through and is fixed to a disc of heavy wood  that serves as a fly, by adding momentum to the whirling spindle. The lower  end of the spindle is rounded or rudely pointed, and when in use the  instrument is placed in a calabash or clean iron kettle.    The mode of operation is as follows: The spinster is seated on a stool,  with a bunch of loose cotton already prepared, in her lap. From this she  twists a thread with her finger, and attaches the end to the spindle at the  top, giving it an energetic twirl that keeps it going for some time.  Meanwhile she disengages and draws out the cotton, from her lap, with both  hands. The length of thread spun (from two to three feet) is then wound  around the spindle, which is again set in motion, and another length added  in the same manner.    In the accompanying sketch, _b_ is the spindle, _c_ the thread already  twisted, _d_ the disc or fly, and _f_ the calabash. When the spindle is not  in motion, the calabash prevents it from falling over, the fly resting  against the sides.    [Illustration: Modern Spinning Apparatus of the Central American Indians.]    In the regions of the Gila and Colorado the natives have been little  disturbed by Europeans. The Spaniards never extended their iron sway over  them, and, like the Araucanians of Peru, they have been supposed to retain  many of the customs and arts of their ancestors. This is to some extent  true. The country soon after the Conquest was reported to be occupied by a  civilized people, who followed agriculture and dwelt in stone houses.  Colonel Emory, in his _Notes of a Military Reconnaissance, from Fort  Leavenworth in Missouri to San Diego in California, including part of the  Arkansas, Del Norte, and Gila Rivers_, (Washington, 1848,) met with remains  of stone and adobe houses, scattered over extensive tracts of  country--sometimes continued over ten, fifteen, and even twenty miles. The  Pecos tribe, he remarks, have preserved alive, till within a few years, the  sacred fire that glowed on the ancient altars; nor is it certain that it is  not yet preserved, for a few Indians took it with them to the Pueblos of  Zuni. The name of Montezuma is said to be as familiar to those Indians, to  the Apaches, Navajos, and others, as that of Washington is to us.    \"Turning from some old ruins towards the Pimos village,\" says Colonel  Emory, \"we urged our guide to go fast, as we wished to see as much of his  people as the day would permit. We were at once impressed with the beauty  and order of the arrangements for irrigating and draining the land. Corn,  wheat, and cotton are the crops of this peaceful and intelligent people.  All the crops have been gathered in, and the stubbles show that they have  been luxuriant. The cotton has been picked and stacked for drying on the  tops of the sheds. The fields are subdivided by ridges of earth into  rectangles of about 200 x 100 feet for the convenience of irrigating. The  fences are stakes wattled with willow and mezquite, and in this particular  set an example of economy in agriculture worthy to be followed by the  Mexicans, who never use fences at all.\" The thatched houses of the Pimos  are dome-shaped, and of wicker work, about six feet high, and from twenty  to fifty feet in diameter. In front is usually a large arbor, on the top of  which cotton in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3657"],[0,"Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America — (#11)"],[1,"before the line.    As I was posted at the sharp angle of the corner, I presently observed  several elephants emerge upon my left and right, as the line advanced  with wonderful regularity, and so close were the animals together that  it was most unlikely any tiger could have broken back.    My servant Michael was behind me in the howdah. He was a quiet man, who  thoroughly understood his work, and seldom spoke without being first  addressed. On this occasion he broke through the rule. \"Nothing in this  beat, sahib,\" he exclaimed . . . . \"Hold your tongue, Michael, till the  cover's beaten out. Haven't I often told you that you can't tell what's  in the jungle until the last corner is gone through?\"    Nearly all the elephants were now out, and only about half a dozen  remained in the jungle, all still advancing in correct line, and perhaps  a dozen yards remaining of dense reeds and creepers forming the acute  angle at the extremity. They still came on. Two or three of the mahouts  shouted, \"The tiger's behind, we must go back and take a longer beat.\"  Nothing remained now except six or seven yards of the sharp corner, and  the elephants marched forward, when a tremendous roar suddenly startled  them in all directions, and one of the largest tigers I have ever seen  sprang forward directly towards Nielmonne, who, I am ashamed to say,  spun round as though upon a pivot, and prevented me from taking a most  splendid shot. The next instant the tiger had bounded back with several  fierce roars, sending the line of elephants flying, and once more  securing safety in the almost impervious jungle from which he had been  driven.    This was a most successful drive, but a terrible failure, owing entirely  to the nervousness of my elephant. I never saw a worse jungle, and now  that the tiger had been moved, it would be doubly awkward to deal with  him, as he would either turn vicious and spring upon an elephant  unawares from so dense a covert, or slink from place to place as the  line advanced, but would never again face the open.    I looked at my watch; it was exactly half-past eight. The mahouts  suggested that we should not disturb him, but give him time to sleep,  and then beat for him in the afternoon. I did not believe in sleep after  he had been so rudely aroused by a long line of elephants, but I clearly  perceived that the mahouts did not enjoy the fun of beating in such  dreadful jungle, and this they presently confessed, and expressed a wish  to have me in the centre of the line, as there was no gun with the  elephants should the tiger attack.    I knew that I should be useless, as it would be impossible to see a foot  ahead in such dense bush, but to give them confidence I put my elephant  in line, and sent forward several scouting elephants to form a line  along a narrow footpath which cut the jungle at right angles about a  quarter of a mile distant.    Once more the line advanced, the elephants marching shoulder to  shoulder, and thus bearing down everything before them, as I determined  to take the jungle backwards and forwards in this close order lest the  wary tiger might crouch, and escape by lying close.    Several times the elephants sounded, and we knew that he must be close  at hand, but it was absolutely impossible to see anything beyond the  thick reedy mass, through which the line of elephants bored as through a  solid obstacle.    Three times with the greatest patience we worked the jungle in this  searching manner, when on the third advance I left the line, finding the  impossibility of seeing anything, and took up my position outside the  jungle on the cultivated land, exactly where the footpath was occupied  by the scout elephants at intervals, which intersected the line of  advance.    Presently there was a commotion among the elephants, two or three shrill  trumpets, then the kettle-drum, and for a moment I caught sight of a dim  shadowy figure stealing through some high reeds upon the border which  fringed the jungle. I immediately fired, although the elephant was so  unsteady that I could not be sure of the shot; also the object was so  indistinct, being concealed in the high reeds, that I should not have  observed it upon any other occasion than our rigid search. Immediately  afterwards, a shout from one of the mahouts upon a scouting elephant  informed us that the tiger had crossed the path and had gone forward,  having thus escaped from the beat!    Here was fresh work cut out! Up to this moment we had managed to keep  him within an area of a quarter of a mile in length, by half a mile in  width; he had now got into new ground, and was in about a three-quarter  mile length of the same unbeaten jungle.    There was nothing else to do but to pursue the same tactics, and we  patiently continued to beat forward and backward, again and again, but  without once sighting our lost game. It was half-past twelve, and the  sun was burning hot, the sky being cloudless. The elephants once more  emerged from the sultry jungle; they were blowing spray with their  trunks upon their flanks, from water sucked up from their stomachs; and  the mahouts were all down-hearted and in despair. \"It's of no use,\" they  said, \"he's gone straight away, who can tell where? When you fired,  perhaps you wounded him, or you missed him; at any rate, he's frightened  and gone clean off, we shall never see him again; the elephants are all  tired with the extreme heat, and we had better go to the river for a  bath.\"    I held a council of war, with the elephants in a circle around me. It is  of no use to oppose men when they are disgusted, you must always start a  new idea. I agreed with my men, but I suggested that as we were all hot,  and the elephants fatigued, the tiger must be in much the same state, as  we had kept him on the run since eight o'clock in the morning, I having  actually timed the hour \"half-past eight\" when he charged out of the  last corner. \"Now,\" said I, \"do you remember that yesterday evening I  killed a buck near some water in a narrow depression in the middle of  tamarisk jungle? I believe that is only a continuation of this horrible  thicket, and if the tiger is nearly played out, he would naturally make  for the water and the cool tamarisk. You form in line in the jungle  here, and give me a quarter of an hour's start, while I go ahead and  take up my position by that piece of water. You then come on, and if the  tiger is in the jungle, he will come forward towards the water, where I  shall meet him; if he's not there, we shall anyhow be on our direct  route, and close to our camp by the river.\"    This was immediately accepted, and leaving the elephants to form line, I  hurried forward on Nielmonne, keeping in the grass outside the edge of  the long jungle.    I had advanced about three-quarters of a mile, when the character of the  jungle changed to tamarisk, and I felt certain that I was near the spot  of yesterday. I accordingly ordered the mahout to turn into the thick  feathery foliage to the left, in search of the remembered water. There  was a slight descent to a long but narrow hollow about 50 or 60 yards  wide; this was filled with clear water for an unknown length.    I was just about to make a remark, when, instead of speaking, I gently  grasped the mahout by the head as I leaned over the howdah, and by this  signal stopped the elephant.    There was a lovely sight, which cheered my heart with that inexpressible  feeling of delight which is the reward for patience and hard work. About  120 yards distant on my left, the head and neck of a large tiger, clean  and beautiful, reposed above the surface, while the body was cooling,  concealed from view. Here was our friend enjoying his quiet bath, while  we had been pounding away up and down the jungles which he had left.    The mahout, although an excellent man, was much excited. \"Fire at him,\"  he whispered.    \"It is too far to make certain,\" I replied in the same undertone.    \"Your rifle will not miss him; fire, or you will lose him. He will see  us to a certainty and be off. If so, we shall never see him again,\"  continued Fazil, the mahout.    \"Hold your tongue,\" I whispered. \"He can't see us, the sun is at our  back, and is shining in his eyes --- see how green they are.\"    At this moment of suspense the tiger quietly rose from his bath, and sat  up on end like a dog. I never saw such a sight. His head was beautiful,  and the eyes shone like two green electric lights, as the sun's rays  reflected from them, but his huge body was dripping with muddy water, as  he had been reclining upon the alluvial bottom.    \"Now's the time,\" whispered the over-eager mahout. \"You can kill him to  a certainty. Fire, or he'll be gone in another moment.\"    \"Keep quiet, you fool, and don't move till I tell you.\" For quite a  minute the tiger sat up in the same position; at last, as though  satisfied that he was in safety and seclusion, he once more lay down  with only the head and neck exposed above the surface.    \"Back the elephant gently, but do not turn round,\" I whispered.  Immediately Nielmonne backed through the feathery tamarisk without the  slightest sound, and we found ourselves outside the jungle. We could  breathe freely.    \"Go on now, quite gently, till I press your head; then turn to the  right, descending through the tamarisk, till I again touch your puggery\"  (turban).    I counted the elephant's paces as she moved softly parallel with the  jungle, until I felt sure of my distance. A slight pressure upon the  mahout's head, and Nielmonne turned to the right. The waving plumes of  the dark-green tamarisk divided as we gently moved forward, and in  another moment we stopped. There was the tiger in the same position,  exactly facing me, but now about 75 paces distant.    \"Keep the elephant quite steady,\" I whispered; and, sitting down upon  the howdah seat, I took a rest with the rifle upon the front bar of the  gun-rack.
