I do not well understand the difference between radiating and reflecting  caloric, for the caloric that is reflected from a body proceeds from it  in straight lines, and may surely be said to radiate from it?    MRS. B.    It is true that there at first appears to be a great analogy between  _radiation_ and _reflection_, as they equally convey the idea of the  transmission of caloric.    But if you consider a little, you will perceive that when a body  _radiates_ caloric, the heat which it emits not only proceeds from, but  has its origin in the body itself. Whilst when a body _reflects_  caloric, it parts with none of its own caloric, but only reflects that  which it receives from other bodies.    EMILY.    Of this difference we have very striking examples before us, in the tin  vessel of water, and the concave mirrors; the first radiates its own  heat, the latter reflect the heat which they receive from other bodies.    CAROLINE.    Now, that I understand the difference, it no longer surprises me that  bodies which radiate, or part with their own caloric freely, should not  have the power of transmitting with equal facility that which they  receive from other bodies.    EMILY.    Yet no body can be said to possess caloric of its own, if all caloric is  originally derived from the sun.    MRS. B.    When I speak of a body radiating its own caloric, I mean that which it  has absorbed and incorporated either immediately from the sun's rays, or  through the medium of any other substance.    CAROLINE.    It seems natural enough that the power of absorption should be in  opposition to that of reflection, for the more caloric a body receives,  the less it will reject.    EMILY.    And equally so that the power of radiation should correspond with that  of absorption. It is, in fact, cause and effect; for a body cannot  radiate heat without having previously absorbed it; just as a spring  that is well fed flows abundantly.    MRS. B.    Fluids are in general very bad radiators of caloric; and air neither  radiates nor absorbs caloric in any sensible degree.    We have not yet concluded our observations on free caloric. But I shall  defer, till our next meeting, what I have further to say on this  subject. I believe it will afford us ample conversation for another  interview.          CONVERSATION III.    CONTINUATION OF THE SUBJECT.      MRS. B.    In our last conversation, we began to examine the tendency of caloric to  restore an equilibrium of temperature. This property, when once well  understood, affords the explanation of a great variety of facts which  appeared formerly unaccountable. You must observe, in the first place,  that the effect of this tendency is gradually to bring all bodies that  are in contact to the same temperature. Thus, the fire which burns in  the grate, communicates its heat from one object to another, till every  part of the room has an equal proportion of it.    EMILY.    And yet this book is not so cold as the table on which it lies, though  both are at an equal distance from the fire, and actually in contact  with each other, so that, according to your theory, they should be  exactly of the same temperature.    CAROLINE.    And the hearth, which is much nearer the fire than the carpet, is  certainly the colder of the two.    MRS. B.    If you ascertain the temperature of these several bodies by a  thermometer (which is a much more accurate test than your feeling), you  will find that it is exactly the same.    CAROLINE.    But if they are of the same temperature, why should the one feel colder  than the other?    MRS. B.    The hearth and the table feel colder than the carpet or the book,  because the latter are not such good _conductors of heat_ as the former.  Caloric finds a more easy passage through marble and wood, than through  leather and worsted; the two former will therefore absorb heat more  rapidly from your hand, and consequently give it a stronger sensation of  cold than the two latter, although they are all of them really of the  same temperature.    CAROLINE.    So, then, the sensation I feel on touching a cold body, is in proportion  to the rapidity with which my hand yields its heat to that body?    MRS. B.    Precisely; and, if you lay your hand successively on every object in the  room, you will discover which are good, and which are bad conductors of  heat, by the different degrees of cold you feel. But, in order to  ascertain this point, it is necessary that the several substances should  be of the same temperature, which will not be the case with those that  are very near the fire, or those that are exposed to a current of cold  air from a window or door.    EMILY.    But what is the reason that some bodies are better conductors of heat  than others?    MRS. B.    This is a point not well ascertained. It has been conjectured that a  certain union or adherence takes place between the caloric and the  particles of the body through which it passes. If this adherence be  strong, the body detains the heat, and parts with it slowly and  reluctantly; if slight, it propagates it freely and rapidly. The  conducting power of a body is therefore, inversely, as its tendency to  unite with caloric.    EMILY.    That is to say, that the best conductors are those that have the least  affinity for caloric.    MRS. B.    Yes; but the term affinity is objectionable in this case, because, as  that word is used to express a chemical attraction (which can be  destroyed only by decomposition), it cannot be applicable to the slight  and transient union that takes place between free caloric and the bodies  through which it passes; an union which is so weak, that it constantly  yields to the tendency which caloric has to an equilibrium. Now you  clearly understand, that the passage of caloric, through bodies that are  good conductors, is much more rapid than through those that are bad  conductors, and that the former both give and receive it more quickly,  and therefore, in a given time, more abundantly, than bad conductors,  which makes them feel either hotter or colder, though they may be, in  fact, both of the same temperature.    CAROLINE.    Yes, I understand it now; the table, and the book lying upon it, being  really of the same temperature, would each receive, in the same space of  time, the same quantity of heat from my hand, were their conducting  powers equal; but as the table is the best conductor of the two, it will  absorb the heat from my hand more rapidly, and consequently produce a  stronger sensation of cold than the book.    MRS. B.    Very well, my dear; and observe, likewise, that if you were to heat the  table and the book an equal number of degrees above the temperature of  your body, the table, which before felt the colder, would now feel the  hotter of the two; for, as in the first case it took the heat most  rapidly from your hand, so it will now impart heat most rapidly to it.  Thus the marble table, which seems to us colder than the mahogany one,  will prove the hotter of the two to the ice; for, if it takes heat more  rapidly from our hands, which are warmer, it will give out heat more  rapidly to the ice, which is colder. Do you understand the reason of  these apparently opposite effects?    EMILY.    Perfectly. A body which is a good conductor of caloric, affords it a  free passage; so that it penetrates through that body more rapidly than  through one which is a bad conductor; and consequently, if it is colder  than your hand, you lose more caloric, and if it is hotter, you gain  more than with a bad conductor of the same temperature.    MRS. B.    But you must observe that this is the case only when the conductors are  either hotter or colder than your hand; for, if you heat different  conductors to the temperature of your body, they will all feel equally  warm, since the exchange of caloric between bodies of the same  temperature is equal. Now, can you tell me why flannel clothing, which  is a very bad conductor of heat, prevents our feeling cold?    CAROLINE.    It prevents the cold from penetrating . . . . . . . .    MRS. B.    But you forget that cold is only a negative quality.    CAROLINE.    True; it only prevents the heat of our bodies from escaping so rapidly  as it would otherwise do.    MRS. B.    Now you have explained it right; the flannel rather keeps in the heat,  than keeps out the cold. Were the atmosphere of a higher temperature  than our bodies, it would be equally efficacious in keeping their  temperature at the same degree, as it would prevent the free access of  the external heat, by the difficulty with which it conducts it.    EMILY.    This, I think, is very clear. Heat, whether external or internal, cannot  easily penetrate flannel; therefore in cold weather it keeps us warm;  and if the weather was hotter than our bodies, it would keep us cool.    MRS. B.    The most dense bodies are, generally speaking, the best conductors of  heat; probably because the denser the body the greater are the number of  points or particles that come in contact with caloric. At the common  temperature of the atmosphere a piece of metal will feel much colder  than a piece of wood, and the latter than a piece of woollen cloth; this  again will feel colder than flannel; and down, which is one of the  lightest, is at the same time one of the warmest bodies.    CAROLINE.    This is, I suppose, the reason that the plumage of birds preserves them  so effectually from the influence of cold in winter?    MRS. B.    Yes; but though feathers in general are an excellent preservative  against cold, down is a kind of plumage peculiar to aquatic birds, and  covers their chest, which is the part most exposed to the water; for  though the surface of the water is not of a lower temperature than the  atmosphere, yet, as it is a better conductor of heat, it feels much  colder, consequently the chest of the bird requires a warmer covering  than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#11)"],[1,"apple. He was glad to take himself out of  the way; and as his impetuous and impulsive nature rendered those under  him liable to find him troublesome, they were not sorry to have him  called elsewhere.    I have mentioned these things as justifying the impression, conveyed by  his letter, that he knew but little of what was going on until his  return in the earlier half of October. Actual absence at a distance, the  larger part of the time, and engrossing cares in getting up expeditions  and supplies for them while he was at home--particularly as, from the  beginning, he had passed over the business of the Court entirely to his  Deputy, Stoughton--it is not difficult to suppose, had prevented his  mind being much, if at all, turned towards it. We may, therefore,  consider that the witchcraft prosecutions were wholly under the control  of Stoughton and those, who, having given him power, would naturally  have influence over his exercise of it.    Calling in question the legality of the Court, Hutchinson expresses a  deep sense of the irregularity of its proceedings; although, as he says,  \"the most important Court to the life of the subject which ever was held  in the Province,\" it meets his unqualified censure, in many points. In  reference to the instance of the Jury's bringing in a verdict of \"Not  guilty,\" in the case of Rebecca Nurse, and being induced, by the  dissatisfaction of the Court, to go out again, and bring her in  \"Guilty,\" he condemns the procedure. Speaking of a wife or husband being  allowed to accuse one the other, he breaks out: \"I shudder while I am  relating it;\" and giving the results at the last trial, he says: \"This  Court of Oyer and Terminer, happy for the country, sat no more.\" Its  proceedings were arbitrary, harsh, and rash. The ordinary forms of  caution and fairness were disregarded. The Judges made no concealment of  a foregone conclusion against the Prisoners at the Bar. No Counsel was  allowed them. The proceedings were summary; and execution followed close  upon conviction. While it was destroying the lives of men and women, of  respectable position in the community, of unblemished and eminent  Christian standing, heads of families, aged men and venerable matrons,  all the ordinary securities of society, outside of the tribunal, were  swept away. In the absence of Sir William Phips, the Chief-justice  absolutely absorbed into his own person the whole Government. His  rulings swayed the Court, in which he acted the part of prosecutor of  the Prisoners, and overbore the Jury. He sat in judgment upon the  sentences of his own Court; and heard and refused, applications and  supplications for pardon or reprieve. The three grand divisions of all  constitutional or well-ordered Governments were, for the time,  obliterated in Massachusetts. In the absence of Phips, the Executive  functions were exercised by Stoughton. While presiding over the Council,  he also held a seat as an elected ordinary member, thus participating  in, as well as directing, its proceedings, sharing, as a leader, in  legislation, acting on Committees, and framing laws. As Chief-justice,  he was the head of the Judicial department. He was Commander-in-chief of  the military and naval forces and forts within the Province proper. All  administrative, legislative, judicial, and military powers were  concentrated in his person and wielded by his hand. No more shameful  tyranny or shocking despotism was ever endured in America, than, in \"the  dark and awful day,\" as it was called, while the Special Commission of  Oyer and Terminer was scattering destruction, ruin, terror, misery and  death, over the country. It is a disgrace to that generation, that it  was so long suffered; and, instead of trying to invent excuses, it  becomes all subsequent generations to feel--as was deeply felt, by  enlightened and candid men, as soon as the storm had blown over and a  prostrate people again stood erect, in possession of their senses--that  all ought, by humble and heart-felt prayer, to implore the divine  forgiveness, as one of the Judges, fully as misguided at the time as the  rest, did, to the end of his days.    As all the official dignities of the Province were combined in  Stoughton, he seems hardly to have known in what capacity he was acting,  as different occasions arose. He signed the Death-warrant of Bridget  Bishop, without giving himself any distinctive title, with his bare name  and his private seal. It is easy to imagine how this lodging of the  whole power of the State in one man, destroyed all safeguards and closed  every door of refuge. When the express messenger of the poor young wife  of John Willard, or the heroic daughter of Elizabeth How, or the agents  of the people of the village, of all classes, combined in supplication  in behalf of Rebecca Nurse, rushing to Boston to lay petitions for  pardon before the Governor, upon being admitted to his presence, found  themselves confronted by the stern countenance of the same person, who,  as Chief-justice, had closed his ears to mercy and frowned the Jury into  Conviction; their hearts sunk within them, and all realized that even  hope had taken flight from the land.    Such was the political and public administration of the Province of  Massachusetts, during the Summer of 1692, under which the Witchcraft  prosecutions were carried on. It was conducted by men whom the Mathers  had brought into office, and who were wholly in their counsels. If there  is, I repeat, an instance in history where particular persons are  responsible for the doings of a Government, this is one. I conclude  these general views of the influence of Increase and Cotton Mather upon  the ideas of the people and the operations of the Government,  eventuating in the Witchcraft tragedy, by restating a proposition,  which, under all the circumstances, cannot, I think, be disputed, that,  if they had been really and earnestly opposed to the proceedings, at any  stage, they could and would have stopped them.    I now turn to a more specific consideration of the subject of Cotton  Mather's connection with the Witchcraft delusion of 1692.          VI.    COTTON MATHER'S CONNECTION WITH THE COURT. SPECTRAL EVIDENCE. LETTER TO  JOHN RICHARDS. ADVICE OF THE MINISTERS.      I am charged with having misrepresented the part Cotton Mather, in  particular, bore in this passage of our history. As nearly the whole  community had been deluded at the time, and there was a general  concurrence in aiding oblivion to cover it, it is difficult to bring it  back, in all its parts, within the realm of absolute knowledge.  Records--municipal, ecclesiastical, judicial, and provincial--were  willingly suffered to perish; and silence, by general consent, pervaded  correspondence and conversation. Notices of it are brief, even in the  most private Diaries. It would have been well, perhaps, if the memory of  that day could have been utterly extinguished; but it has not. On the  contrary, as, in all manner of false and incorrect representations, it  has gone into the literature of the country and the world and become  mixed with the permanent ideas of mankind, it is right and necessary to  present the whole transaction, so far as possible, in the light of  truth. Every right-minded man must rejoice to have wrong, done to the  reputation of the dead or living, repaired; and I can truly say that no  one would rejoice more than I should, if the view presented of Cotton  Mather, in the _North American Review_, of April, 1869, could be shown  to be correct. In this spirit, I proceed to present the evidence that  belongs to the question.    The belief of the existence of a personal Devil was then all but  universally entertained. So was the belief of ghosts, apparitions, and  spectres. There was no more reluctance to think or speak of them than of  what we call natural objects and phenomena. Great power was ascribed to  the Devil over terrestrial affairs; but it had been the prevalent  opinion, that he could not operate upon human beings in any other way  than through the instrumentality of other human beings, in voluntary  confederation with him; and that, by means of their spectres, he could  work any amount of mischief. While this opinion prevailed, the testimony  of a witness, that he had seen the spectre of a particular person  afflicting himself or any one else, was regarded as proof positive that  the person, thus spectrally represented, was in league with the Devil,  or, in other words, a Witch. This idea had been abandoned by some  writers, who held that the Devil could make use of the spectre of an  innocent person, to do mischief; and that, therefore, it was not  positive or conclusive proof that any one was a Witch because his  spectre had been seen tormenting others. The logical conclusion, from  the views of these later writers, was that spectral evidence, as it was  called, bearing against an accused party, was wholly unreliable and must  be thrown out, entirely, in all cases.    The Reviewer says the \"Clergy of New England\" adopted the views of the  writers just alluded to, and held that spectral evidence was unreliable  and unsafe, and ought to be utterly rejected; and particularly maintains  that such was the opinion of Cotton Mather. It is true that they  professed to have great regard for those writers; but it is also true,  that neither Mather nor the other Ministers in 1692, adopted the  conclusion which the Reviewer allows to be inevitably demanded by sound  reason and common sense, namely, that \"no spectral evidence must be  admitted.\" On the contrary, they did authorize the \"admission\" of  spectral evidence. This I propose to prove; and if I succeed in doing  it, the whole fabric of the article in the _North American Review_ falls  to the ground.    It is necessary, at this point, to say a word as to the _Mather Papers_.  They were published by a Committee of the Massachusetts Historical  Society, in"]]]
