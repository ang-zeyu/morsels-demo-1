In the evening the girl, having adorned  herself in her richest ornaments, prepared to go out, on which the  cauzi, like a jealous and distracted lover, falling at her feet,  entreated her to stay, or let him attend her, and not rend his heart  by her absence. The woman upon this informed him that she was ordered  to attend an entertainment by the roy's son, and durst not disobey,  nor could she take him with her, as only musicians and dancers would  be admitted. The cauzi upon this replied that he played on the same  instrument as herself, and had, besides, some curious accomplishments  that would highly please the roy's son. The dancing-girl, thinking  him in jest, out of contempt gave him her mundal,[87] and desired him  to play, which he did in so masterly a manner that she was delighted,  saying that his company would give her superiority over her fellows and  do her honour with the roy's son. Accordingly he with his companions  attended the girl to the tents of the young roy.    \"As is the custom of Dekkan, many sets of loolies[88] and dancing-girls  were ordered to perform at the same time, and having finished  their parts, the roy's son called for the players and mummers. The  dancing-girl now obtained leave for the cauzi and one of his companions  to show their feats. Having assumed the dress of women, they entered  ogling and smiling, and so well imitated the mummers in playing on  the mundal, dancing, and mimicry, that the roy's son was charmed  with their performances. At length they each drew a dagger, and,  like the dancers of Dekkan, continued to flourish them for some  time, making a thousand antic postures in advancing, retreating,  and turning round. At last, suddenly rushing upon the roy's son,  they plunged both the daggers into his breast, afterwards attacking  his companions. Their remaining friends, who were watching without  the tent, on hearing an alarm, ripped up the curtain, and entered  to assist them. Many of the company, being much intoxicated, were  easily put to death. The cauzi with his friends extinguished all  the lights, and, making their escape through the rent, mingled with  the crowd. The outcry soon became general round the tents. Great  confusion ensued, and various reports and alarms took place. Some  said that the sultan had crossed the river and surprised the camp,  others that one of his chiefs, with twelve thousand men, had cut off  both the roy and his son. The night was uncommonly dark, and the camp  extended near ten miles, so that circumstances were variously reported,  and the different chiefs, ignorant of the real cause of the alarm,  contended themselves with waiting in their several quarters; under  arms. About four thousand of the sultan's troops, in this interim,  crossed the river in boats and rafts which had been prepared for the  purpose. The enemy's foot, stationed to oppose the passage, terrified  by the alarm in camp and the approach of the sultan's forces, fled in  confusion without waiting to be attacked. Before the morning Feroze  Shaw had crossed the river with his whole army, and at dawn assaulted  the enemy's camp with great fury. Dewul Roy grieved by the death of  his son and panic struck at the bravery of the assailants, made but  a faint resistance. Before sunrise, having taken up his son's corpse,  he fled with his army. The sultan gained immense plunder in the camp,  and pursued him to the vicinity of Beejanuggur. Several actions  happened on the way, all of which were fortunate to the sultan, and  the roads were heaped up with the bodies of the slaughtered Hindoos.\"    Bukka reached Vijayanagar in safety and took refuge behind its  fortifications, while the Sultan sent his brother Ahmad (afterwards  Sultan), whom he had honoured with the title of \"Khankhanan,\" to  ravage the rich districts south of the city. Ahmad fulfilled his  instructions and returned with numberless prisoners, and amongst them  many Brahmans. The relatives of these in the city begged the aged  Raya (Harihara II., still alive) to offer ransom, and after much  negotiation the Sultan accepted \"ten lakhs of oons\"[89] and agreed  to the execution of a treaty.    According to this treaty, which was entered into a few months  before the close of the Hijra year 801, I.E. a few months before 3rd  September A.D. 1399, the boundaries of the two kingdoms were to be  the same as before the war, and each party agreed to refrain from  molesting the subjects of the other. This does not look as though  the Sultan had gained any very material advantage in the campaign,  since the true boundary was always a subject of dispute. I obtain  the date above given from Firishtah's sentence: \"In a few months  after the conclusion of this campaign, and the beginning of the year  802, the sultan marched to punish Nersing,\" a chief who had raised  disturbances on the borders of Berar.    The BURHAN-I MAASIR passes over this war with great brevity. It states  that the Sultan began it, and that at its close he accepted a large  indemnity and promise of payment of annual tribute. The date given  is identical.    Not long after this war, but certainly not before October 15,  A.D. 1399, Harihara II, died, and was succeeded by Bukka, his son.    We have little to guide us as to the events of Bukka's reign, but  Firishtah states that he ceased to pay tribute to Firuz Shah, partly  owing to instigation from Gujarat, Malwa, and Khandeish. In Hijra 808  (June 1405 to June 1406 A.D.) four years' tribute was owing, but the  Sultan took no notice, and waited for a more convenient time.    Bukka was followed on the throne of Vijayanagar by his brother Deva  Raya I., the date of whose coronation is fixed by an inscription  at Hasan in Mysore as November 5, 1406.[90] The last inscription of  Bukka Raya at present known bears a date corresponding to April 30th  in that year -- in Hindu reckoning the 12th day of the first half of  the month Vaisakha, in the (expired) Saka year 1328, the name of the  cyclic year being \"Vyaya.\"[91]        CHAPTER 5    Deva Raya I. (A.D. 1406 to 1419)    The amorous monarch, Deva Raya I. -- The farmer's beautiful daughter --  The king's escapade -- The city threatened -- A Hindu princess wedded  to a Muhammadan prince -- Firuz Shah's anger -- Pertal's marriage --  King Vijaya -- Probable date of accession of Deva Raya II.    Firishtah tells us of an event that must have taken place towards  the end of the year A.D. 1406, in which the principal actor was the  king of Vijayanagar. This king I believe to have been Bukka II.'s  successor, his younger brother, Deva Raya I. The story relates to a  mad adventure of the Raya which he undertook in order to secure for  himself the person of a beautiful girl, the daughter of a farmer in  Mudkal. His desire to possess her attained such a pitch, that he made  an expedition into the debatable land north of the Tungabhadra for the  sole purpose of capturing the girl and adding her to his harem. I have  already shown reasons for supposing that Bukka II. was a middle-aged  man at his accession, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that this  hot-blooded monarch was his younger brother, who began to reign in  November 1406 A.D. His escapade must be narrated in full as told by  Firishtah, since it led to very important consequences.    \"There resided in the town of Mudkul a farmer, who was blessed with  a daughter of such exquisite beauty, that the Creator seemed to have  united all his powers in making her perfect.\"    This attractive person was educated by an old Brahman, whose admiration  of her led him to think that she would prove a desirable member of  the Raya's household.    \"He proceeded to Beejanuggur and being introduced to the roy, spoke  in such praise of the beauty and accomplishments of the young maid,  that he was fired with the desire of possessing her, and entreated  the bramin to procure her for him of her parents in marriage. This  request was what the bramin earnestly wished, and he immediately  agreed to satisfy him; upon which the roy despatched him with rich  gifts and great promises of favours to the parents, and the title of  ranee, or princess, for their beautiful daughter. The bramin lost no  time in his journey, and, upon his arrival at the farmer's house,  delivered to him and his wife the roy's orders, that they should  repair to Beejanuggur with their daughter. The parents were overjoyed  at such unexpected good fortune, and calling for the young maid, laid  before her the rich gifts of the roy, congratulated her on being soon  to be united to a great prince, and attempted to throw upon her neck  a golden collar set with jewels, as a token of immediate espousals,  and which, if done, could not have been broken off.    \"The beautiful virgin, to their great astonishment, drawing her  neck from compliance, refused to receive the collar, and observed,  that whoever entered the harem of Beejanuggur, was afterwards not  permitted to see even her nearest relations and friends; and though  they might be happy to sell her for worldly riches, yet she was too  fond of her parents to submit to eternal absence from them, even  for all the splendour of the palace of Beejanuggur. This declaration  was accompanied with affectionate tears, which melted her parents;  who rather than use force, dismissed the bramin with all his gifts,  and he returned, chagrined and disappointed, to Beejanuggur....    \"When the bramin arrived at Beejanuggur, and related to the roy the  failure of his scheme, the prince's love became outrageous, and he  resolved to gratify it by force, though the object resided in the  heart of Feroze Shaw's dominions.[92] For this purpose he quitted  Beejanuggur with a great army, on pretence of going the tour of his  countries; and upon his arrival on the banks of the River Tummedra,  having selected five thousand of his best horse, and giving the reins  of his conduct to love, commanded them, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#11)"],[1,"turn  cravens before thirty vagabond Spaniards; but, says the historian,  these are secrets of Divine justice; perhaps for their many sins they  did not deserve that at that time the word should be preached to them.    We return now to the adelantado, whom we left at Tobasco. Severe wars  with the Indians, want of arms and provisions, and, above all,  desertions instigated by the fame of Peruvian riches, had left him at a  low ebb. In this situation he was joined by Captain Gonzalo Nieto and  the small band which had been compelled to evacuate Yucatan, and by the  presence of these old companions his spirits were again roused.    But the pacification of Tobasco was much more difficult than was  supposed. By communication with the Spaniards, the Indians had lost  their fears of them. The country was bad for carrying on war,  particularly with cavalry, on account of the marshes and pools; their  provisions were again cut off; many of the soldiers went away  disgusted, and others, from the great humidity and heat, sickened and  died.    While they were in this extremity, the Captain Diego de Contreras, with  no fixed destination, and ready to embark in any of the great  enterprises which at that time attracted the adventurous soldier,  arrived at the port. He had with him a vessel of his own, with  provisions and other necessaries, his son, and twenty Spaniards. The  adelantado represented to him the great service he might render the  king, and by promises of reward induced him to remain. With this  assistance he was enabled to sustain himself in Tobasco until, having  received additional re-enforcements, he effected the pacification of  the whole of that country.    The adelantado now made preparations to return to Yucatan. Champoton  was selected as the place of disembarcation. According to some of the  historians, he did not himself embark on this expedition, but sent his  son. It seems more certain, however, that he went in person as  commander-in-chief of the armada, and leaving his son, Don Francisco de  Montejo, in command of the soldiers, returned to Tobasco, as being  nearer to Mexico, from which country he expected to receive and send on  more recruits and necessaries. The Spaniards landed some time in the  year 1537, and again planted the royal standard in Yucatan. The Indians  allowed them to land without noise or opposition, but they were only  lying in wait for an opportunity to destroy them. In a few days a great  multitude assembled, and at midnight they crept silently up the paths  and roads which led to the camp of the Spaniards, seized one of the  sentinels, and killed him; but the noise awoke the Spaniards, who,  wondering less at the attack than at its being made by night, rushed to  their arms. Ignorant as they were of the ground, in the darkness all  was confusion. On the east, west, and south they heard the clamour and  outcries of the Indians. Nevertheless, they made great efforts, and the  Indians, finding their men falling, and hearing the groans of the  wounded and dying, relaxed in the fury of their attack, and at length  retreated. The Spaniards did not pursue them, but remained in the camp,  keeping watch till daylight, when they collected and buried the bodies  of their own dead.    For some days the Indians did not make any hostile demonstrations, but  they kept away or concealed as much as possible all supplies of  provisions. The Spaniards were much straitened, and obliged to sustain  themselves by catching fish along the shores. On one occasion two  Spaniards, who had straggled to some distance from the camp, fell into  the hands of the Indians, who carried them away alive, sacrificed them  to their idols, and feasted upon their bodies.    During this time the Indians were forming a great league of all the  caciques in the country, and gathered in immense numbers at Champoton.  As soon as all the confederates were assembled, they attacked with a  horrible noise the camp of the Spaniards, who could not successfully  contend against such a multitude. Many Indians fell, but they counted  as well lost a thousand of their own number for the life of one  Spaniard. There was no hope but in flight, and the Spaniards retreated  to the shore. The Indians pursued them, heaping insults upon them,  entered their camp, loaded themselves with the clothing and other  things, which in the hurry of retreat they had been obliged to leave  behind, put on their dresses, and from the shore mocked and scoffed at  them, pointing with their fingers, taunting them with cowardice, and  crying out, \"Where is the courage of the Spaniards?\" The latter,  hearing from their boats these insults, resolved that death and fame  were better than life and ignominy, and, wounded and worn out as they  were, took up their arms and returned to the shore. Another fierce  battle ensued; and the Indians, dismayed by the resolution with which  these vanquished men again made front against them, retired slowly,  leaving the Spaniards masters of the field. The Spaniards cared for no  more, content to recover the ground they had lost.    From this time the Indians determined not to give battle again, and the  great multitude, brought together from different places, dispersed, and  returned to their houses. The Spaniards remained more at their ease.  The Indians, seeing that they could not be driven out of the country,  and did not intend to leave it, contracted a sort of friendship with  them, but they were not able to make any advances into the interior. On  every attempt they were so badly received that they were compelled to  return to their camp in Champoton, which was, in fact, their only  refuge.    As Champoton was on the coast, which now began to be somewhat known,  vessels occasionally touched there, from which the poor Spaniards  relieved some of their necessities. Occasionally a new companion  remained, but their numbers still diminished, many, seeing the delay  and the little fruit derived from their labours, abandoning the  expedition. The time came when there were only nineteen Spaniards in  Champoton, the names of some of whom are still preserved, and they  affirm in their judicial declaration, that in this critical situation  they owed their preservation to the prudence and good management of Don  Francisco Montejo, the son of the adelantado.    Again they were relieved, and again their force dwindled away. The fame  of the riches of Peru was in every mouth. The poverty of Yucatan was  notorious. There were no mines; there was but little encouragement for  others to join the expedition, and those in Champoton were discouraged.  Struggling with continual hardships and dangers, they made no advance  toward the conquest of the country; all who could, endeavoured to get  away, some going in canoes, others by land, as occasion offered. In  order to confer upon some means of bettering the condition of things,  it was necessary for the son of the adelantado to visit his father at  Tobasco, and he set out, leaving the soldiers at Champoton under the  command of his cousin, a third Don Francisco.    During his absence matters became worse. The people continued going  away, and Don Francisco knew that if they lost Champoton, which had  cost them so much, all was lost. Consulting with a few who were most  desirous of persevering in the enterprise, he brought together those  who were suspected of meditating desertion, and told them to go at  once, and leave the rest to their fate. The poor soldiers, embarrassed,  and ashamed at being confronted with companions whom they intended to  desert, determined to remain.    But the succour so earnestly hoped for was delayed. All the expedition  which the son of the adelantado could make was not sufficient for those  who remained in Champoton. They had been nearly three years without  making any advances or any impression upon the country. Despairing of  its conquest, and unable to exist in the straits in which they found  themselves, they talked openly of disbanding, and going where fortune  might lead them. The captain did all that he could to encourage them,  but in vain. All had their luggage and ship-stores ready to embark, and  nothing was talked of but leaving the country.    The exertions of the captain induced them to take better counsel, and  they agreed not to execute their resolution hastily, but, to save  themselves from injurious imputations, first to send notice of their  intention to the adelantado. Juan de Contreras was sent with the  despatches, who gave the adelantado, besides, a full account of the  desperate condition in which they remained at Champoton.    His intelligence gave the adelantado much anxiety. All his resources  were exhausted; he had been unable to procure the succour necessary,  and he knew that if the Spaniards abandoned Champoton, it would be  impossible to prosecute the conquest of Yucatan. Aware of their  necessities, when the news arrived, he had some Spaniards collected to  go to their assistance, and now, by gifts and promises, he made some  additions; and while waiting until these could be got ready, despatched  Alonzo Rosado, one of the new recruits, to give notice of the succour  at hand.    It does not appear whether the adelantado went to Champoton in person,  but vessels arrived carrying soldiers, provisions, clothing, and arms,  and toward the end of the year 1539 his son returned, with twenty  horsemen, from New Spain. The drooping spirits of the Spaniards were  revived, and again they conceived hopes of achieving the conquest of  the country.    About this time, too, the adelantado, grieving over the common  misfortune of himself and those who had been constant and enduring, but  doubting his own fortune, and confiding in the valour of his son Don  Francisco, determined to put into the hands of the latter the  pacification of Yucatan. He was at that time settled in the government  of Chiapas, to which place he summoned his "]]]
