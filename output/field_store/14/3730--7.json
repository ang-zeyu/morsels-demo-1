[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36036"],[0,"Metabolic Adaptation to Climate and Distribution of the Raccoon Procyon Lotor (#11)"],[1,"s._--In addition to a low [.H]_{b}, this species possesses  other characteristics that limit its reproductive potential:  low-quality diet, delayed reproduction, and birth of a single young  each year. Because there does not appear to be any other feature of  its life history that can counteract the influence of these factors,  r_{max} in _Potos flavus_ has evolved to be only 48% of expected  (0.30; Table 10). Its close relative, the olingo, _Bassaricyon gabbii_,  appears to share the same condition (Table 10).    SUMMARY.--This brief survey illustrates that, with the exception of  _Potos flavus_, procyonids tend to have values of r_{max} that are  higher than those predicted for them on the basis of mass (Table 10).  Regression analysis indicates that, within the family, body mass  accounts for only a small amount (3%) of the variation in r_{max},  whereas the positive slope of the correlation between r_{maxr} and  H_{br} (R = 0.93) suggests that low metabolism has a limiting effect  on r_{max} (see Table 10, footnote f). The implication here is that  low [.H]_{b} would be associated with a lower rate of biosynthesis,  a slower growth rate, and a longer generation time. Procyonids with  low [.H]_{b} but higher than expected r_{max} must possess other  traits that serve to offset the effects of low metabolism. Our survey  indicates that the following features compensate for low [.H]_{b} and  help increase r_{max}: (1) a high-quality diet may make biosynthesis  and growth more efficient, thus optimizing the time element associated  with each of these processes; (2) larger litter sizes and cooperation  in care of the young may increase survivorship in spite of a slower  growth rate; and (3) an early age of first reproduction, a long  reproductive life span, and moderate-size litters (two to four young)  may in the long run add as many individuals to the population as a  shortened generation time. Our survey also suggests that, at the other  extreme, factors such as a low-quality diet, reduced litter size,  absence of cooperative care of the young, delayed age of first  reproduction, and shortened reproductive life span all serve to  decrease r_{max}. Thus, it is obvious that diet, litter size, social  structure, reproductive strategy, and reproductive life span can operate  synergistically with [.H]_{b} to magnify its influence on r_{max} (as  with _Procyon lotor_ and _Potos flavus_), or they can function in  opposition to [.H]_{b} to change the direction of its influence on  r_{max} (as with _Bassariscus astutus_, _Procyon cancrivorus_, _Nasua  narica_, and perhaps _Nasua nasua_).      _Basal Metabolism and Climatic Distribution_    _Procyon lotor._--The evolution of a higher [.H]_{b} (Tables 7, 8) may  have been the physiological cornerstone that enabled _Procyon lotor_  to break out of the mold being exploited by other procyonids and to  generalize its use of habitats and climates. Once this basic  physiological change was in place, selection for appropriate  alterations in thermal conductance, capacity for evaporative cooling,  diversity of diet, and energy storage would have provided this species  with the suite of adaptations needed to extend its distribution into  other habitats and climates. Support for this concept follows from the  fact that high levels of [.H]_{b} are associated with (1) cold-hardiness  in mammals that live in cold-temperate and arctic climates (Scholander  et al., 1950c; Irving et al., 1955; Irving, 1972:115, 116; Shield, 1972;  Vogel, 1980; Golightly and Ohmart, 1983); (2) the ability to utilize a  wide variety of food resources and to occupy a large number of different  environments and habitats (McNab, 1980a); and (3) a high intrinsic rate  of natural increase (McNab, 1980a; Hennemann, 1983; Lillegraven et al.,  1987; Nicoll and Thompson, 1987; Thompson, 1987).    OTHER PROCYONIDS.--Other procyonids (_Potos flavus_, _Procyon  cancrivorus_, _Nasua narica_, and _Nasua nasua_) have lower than  predicted [.H]_{b}'s (Table 7), a characteristic that is considered to  be an energy-saving adaptation for those that live in relatively stable  tropical and subtropical habitats (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977;  Chevillard-Hugot et al., 1980; Mueller and Rost, 1983). However,  _Bassariscus astutus_ is found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate  climates. This species is found from tropical Mexico to temperate  regions of the western United States (Kaufmann, 1982, 1987; Nowak and  Paradiso, 1983:979). In the northern part of its distribution,  _Bassariscus astutus_ lives in habitats that are unstable (arid  regions), that are low in productivity, and that characteristically  have marked seasonal changes in temperature. Its lower than predicted  [.H]_{b} could be an important water-conserving adaptation at times when  temperatures are high (McNab and Morrison, 1963; McNab, 1966; MacMillen  and Lee, 1970; Noll-Banholzer, 1979) and an important energy-conserving  mechanism when cold weather may limit food availability and hunting time  (Scholander et al., 1950c; Wang et al., 1973). As will be seen later,  _Bassariscus astutus_ is unique among procyonids with lower than  predicted [.H]_{b}'s in that it also has a lower than predicted  C_{mw} (Table 7). This allows it to use less energy than expected for  thermoregulation at low temperatures. Another species with a similar set  of adaptations (lower than predicted [.H]_{b} and C_{mw}) is the arctic  hare, _Lepus arcticus_ (Wang et al., 1973), which lives in one of  the coldest and least-productive regions on earth. Wang et al. (1973)  suggest that this combination of adaptations allows _Lepus arcticus_  to better match its energy requirements to the low productivity of its  environment. A similar relationship may hold for _Bassariscus astutus_,  particularly in colder arid portions of its distribution, and may be the  reason that it, but not other procyonids with low [.H]_{b}'s, has been  able to inhabit temperate climates.        MINIMUM THERMAL CONDUCTANCE      _Background_    Thermal conductance is a measure of the ease with which heat is  passively transferred to or from a body through its tissues and pelt.  Within T_{n}, a mammal is able to vary its thermal conductance over a  wide range of values by changing heat transfer characteristics of both  of these layers. Minimum thermal conductance occurs when total heat  transfer through these layers is reduced to its lowest possible rate.  This minimum value, which is the reciprocal of maximum resistance,  occurs, theoretically, but not always practically (see McNab, 1988b),  at the animal's T_{lc} and is best estimated under standard conditions  in a metabolism chamber (McNab, 1980b; Aschoff, 1981). Minimum thermal  conductance scales to body mass (McNab and Morrison, 1963; Herreid and  Kessel, 1967; McNab, 1970, 1979b; Bradley and Deavers, 1980; Aschoff,  1981). Therefore, to make comparisons between species of various sizes,  we scaled out body mass by expressing C_{mw} as the ratio of measured  to predicted values (C_{mwr}; Table 7). These ratios were used to make  comparisons of heat-transfer characteristics between species that  occupy different habitats or climates.      _Effect of Molt on Thermal Conductance_    In summer, T_{lc}'s of male and female _Procyon lotor_ (Figure 2) were  very similar to those of other procyonids (22 deg.C-26 deg.C; Table 7). In  winter, T_{lc} of both sexes shifted downward to 11 deg.C (Figure 3). This  seasonal shift in T_{lc} occurred as the result of a seasonal change  in minimum thermal conductance (Table 3). For many northern mammals, a  seasonal change in thermal conductance is partly mediated via cyclic  changes in the insulative quality of their pelt (Scholander et al.,  1950a; Irving et al., 1955; Hart, 1956, 1957; Irving, 1972:165).    _Procyon lotor_ begins to shed its heavy winter coat about the time  its young are born. Molt progresses through summer and by late August  the new coat is complete (Stuewer, 1942). During its summer molt,  _Procyon lotor_'s C_{mw} increased by about 49% over the value for  female raccoons in winter (Table 3). In summer, therefore, it had the  highest mass specific C_{mw} of those procyonids considered  (C_{mwr} = 1.77 and 1.79; Table 7). An increase in thermal conductance  facilitates passive heat loss for temperate and arctic species, and  this serves as an important thermoregulatory adaptation during warm  summer months (Scholander et al., 1950c; Irving et al., 1955;  Hart, 1956, 1957; Irving, 1972:165). This adaptation is particularly  important to those temperate- and arctic-zone species (including  raccoons) whose [.H]_{b}'s do not decrease during summer (Irving et al.,  1955). From August on, the fur of _Procyon lotor_ becomes increasingly  longer and heavier, with peak, or prime, condition occurring in late  fall and early winter (Stuewer, 1942). Minimum conductance of our  captive raccoons was lowest in winter (C_{mwr} = 1.15) when their pelts  were in prime condition (Tables 3, 7). Because \"primeness\" of raccoon  pelts varies geographically, thicker pelts being associated with colder  climates (Goldman, 1950:21; Whitney and Underwood, 1952:24-41), the  degree of seasonal change in C_{mw} must also vary geographically.    The only other procyonid for which a seasonal molt has been described  is _Bassariscus astutus_. Molt in this species extends from late summer  to late fall (Toweill and Toweill, 1978). How molt effects thermal  conductance in _Bassariscus astutus_ is not known because metabolic  data for this species (Table 7) apparently were collected only when  their pelts were in prime condition (Chevalier, 1985).    Goldman (1950:20) reports that _Procyon cancrivorus_ does not have a  seasonal molt. Like other tropical procyonids, _Procyon cancrivorus_  lives in an environment that has the following characteristics: high  even temperatures throughout the year (1 deg.C-13 deg.C difference in monthly  mean"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36069"],[0,"Explorers and Travellers (#11)"],[1,"with scouts and camp-followers, largely  consisting of fur-traders and frontiersmen, induced a lively interest in  their accounts of the western country held by their enemies, the Indian  and the Frenchman. Certain it is that Carver acquired such ideas of the  extent, fertility, natural wealth, and possibilities of the great and  unknown West as fired his adventurous spirit with a firm determination  to solve the important geographical problems connected therewith.    His objects, he states, were to gain knowledge concerning the Indian  tribes to the west of the Mississippi, to ascertain the natural  resources of the country, and to cross the American continent between  the forty-third and forty-sixth degrees of north latitude. Ultimately he  contemplated the establishment of a trading-post at some suitable point  on the Pacific Coast.    Carver was not ignorant of the great danger involved in such an  undertaking, where he was obliged to intrust his life to the mercy of  unknown Indians for a prolonged time. Indeed, considering his  experiences at the massacre of Englishmen and provincials at Fort Henry,  it seems surprising that he would ever trust a savage or a Frenchman. In  the campaign of 1757, Carver volunteered to accompany the detachment of  fifteen hundred men which General Webb sent forward to reinforce the  garrison at Fort Henry, then anticipating an attack from Montcalm. The  garrison, commanded by the gallant Monro, who resisted until his guns  burst and his ammunition was nearly exhausted, surrendered to the  combined force of Indians and French under Montcalm, who promised safe  conduct and private property. As the English force moved out the next  morning the Indians, inflamed by liquor, song, and dance, butchered the  sick and wounded and then fell upon the helpless captives, of whom there  were, according to French accounts, about sixty killed and four hundred  robbed and maltreated. Montcalm and Levi, to their credit, though too  late, made heroic personal efforts which mitigated the horrors of the  situation.    [Illustration: Indian Tomahawk. (From Carver's Book.)]    Among the unfortunates was Carver, who, robbed and stripped by the  savages, appealed to a French sentry for protection only to be repelled  with abuse. Realizing finally that to remain quiet was to meet certain  death, Carver and a few others attempted to escape by breaking unarmed  through the surrounding lines of Indian fiends. In this desperate effort  for life Carver was twice wounded, badly beaten, seized by two Indians,  and led away to death, which he escaped by the appearance of a British  officer in full uniform, who was such a prize that his captors left  Carver to secure a more valuable victim. Profiting by the respite Carver  fled to the nearest woods, where, exhausted and nearly naked, he  concealed himself in a thicket until night. For three days he wandered  through the densest part of the forest, suffering tortures from travel  under such conditions, often in danger of recapture, and without food  until he reached, in a nearly exhausted condition, the English  settlements.    An attempt at transcontinental exploration was then looked on as  foolhardy and visionary in the extreme, even to those friends of Carver  who never deserted him. One of these, Dr. Lettsom, wrote in the third  edition of Carver's travels, fifteen years after the journey, as  follows: \"He suggested an attempt by land across the northwest parts of  America, and actually drew a chart of his proposed route for effecting  his project, which, however visionary it may now be deemed, affords at  least a proof of the enterprising spirit of Carver.\"    Unmoved by the sneers of his critics, and undeterred by recollections of  Indian cruelty and perfidy, Carver arranged the details of his journey  at his private expense, and in June, 1766, he quitted Boston, and  travelling by the way of Albany and Niagara reached his headquarters,  Michillimackinac, now known as Mackinac. Here he made definite  arrangements for his serious work of exploration. At this time English  traders extended their journeys to Prairie-du-Chien for the purpose of  purchasing furs from Indians rendezvousing there, and with one of these  parties Carver was to travel, relying on the Governor of Mackinaw to  forward supplies to St. Anthony. Leaving the Fort, September 3d, and  travelling by canoe, he reached the islands of the Grand Traverse, and  there spent one night. One of the chiefs, to whom a present was given,  made, on Carver's departure, the following prayer, which is worthy of  reproduction as a specimen of Indian eloquence: \"May the Great Spirit  favor you with a prosperous voyage; may He give you an unclouded sky and  smooth waters by day, and may you lay down by night on a beaver blanket  to uninterrupted sleep and pleasant dreams, and may you find continual  protection under the calumet of peace.\"    Carver followed the route of Joliet and Marquette through Green Bay and  up Fox River to the great town of the Winnebagoes, where he found the  Indians presided over by a queen instead of a sachem. Carver speaks of  the extreme richness of soil and abundance of cultivated products and  wild game, mentioning grapes, plums, Indian corn, beans, pumpkins,  squashes, watermelons, and tobacco from cultivation; fish from the lake;  wild fowl so abundant that frequently the sun would be obscured by them  for some minutes together, while deer, bears, and beavers were very  numerous. The usual portage was made by him from the Fox to the  Wisconsin River, into which his canoes were launched on the 8th of  October. Seven days carried him to Prairie-du-Chien, at the junction of  the Wisconsin and Mississippi, which was at that time a town of some  three hundred families and had become a great trading mart for the  adjacent tribes, who assembled in great numbers annually in the latter  part of May.    [Illustration: _The falls of_ St. Anthony _in the River_ MISSISSIPPI,  _near 2400 Miles from its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico._ (From  Carver's Book.)]    At Prairie-du-Chien Carver parted with the traders, who were to winter  at that point, and obtaining a Canadian as interpreter and a Mohawk  Indian as a servant, he purchased a canoe, and on October 19th,  proceeding up the Mississippi, he fell in with a straggling band of  Indians which barely failed of plundering him. November 1st brought him  to Lake Pepin, near which he discovered what appeared to be the remains  of extended intrenchments, centuries old, as he thought, but which are  now known to be Indian mounds, probably erected as sites for their  wigwams, so as to keep them above the annual overflow and inundation.    The coming of winter and the forming of river ice obliged him to quit  his canoe opposite the mouth of the St. Peter, or Minnesota River,  whence by land he reached the Falls of St. Anthony on November 17, 1766,  probably the first white American to visit them.    The noise and appearance of the Falls of St. Anthony impressed Carver  very strongly, and his account of them is worthy of reproduction in view  of the changes that have taken place within the past one hundred and  thirty years:    \"This amazing body of waters, which are above 250 yards over, form a  most pleasing cataract; they fall perpendicularly about thirty feet, and  the rapids below, in the space of 300 yards more, render the descent  considerably greater; so that when viewed at a distance, they appear to  be much higher than they really are.    \"In the middle of the Falls stands a small island about forty feet  broad and somewhat longer, on which grow a few cragged hemlock and  spruce trees; and about half way between this island and the eastern  shore is a rock lying at the very edge of the Fall, in an oblique  position, that appears to be about five or six feet broad and thirty or  forty long.\"    Leaving the falls, Carver proceeded up the Mississippi to the mouth of  the St. Francis, the farthest of Hennepin in 1680, discovering on the  way Rum and Goose Rivers. Warned by the severity of the cold that winter  was fast coming on, Carver returned to his canoe at the mouth of the  Minnesota River and decided to explore that stream, of which only the  lower portion had ever been visited--by Le Sueur in 1700.    Following the Minnesota about two hundred miles he reached, on December  7th, the winter camp of a large tribe of Indians, about one thousand in  number, who were designated by Carver as the Naudowessie (Santees).  Advancing boldly, with his calumet of peace fastened to the prow of his  canoe, he was received in a friendly manner. After the usual smoking of  the pipe of peace, during which he says the tent was nearly broken down  by the crowd of savages, who, as a rule, had never seen a white man, he  was treated with great respect.    Among these Indians Carver passed the winter, filling in his five  months' stay by hunting and other Indian amusements. From the Indians he  learned that the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, and the Bourbon (the Red  River of the North) had their sources within thirty miles of each  other. This led to the natural but erroneous opinion that Carver had  reached the highest land of North America, when in reality he was at an  elevation of only twelve hundred feet.    Carver also spoke of \"the Oregon, or the River of the West,\" as having  its sources somewhat farther to the west. This is the first time that  the word Oregon appears in literature, and Carver gives no account of  its meaning.    [Illustration: A Calumet. (From Carver's Book.)]    The Indians had traditions as to the extreme plentifulness of gold to  the west of the \"Shining Mountains,\" of which our explorer says, on the  strength of Indian reports:    \"The mountains that lie to the west of St. Peter are called the Shining  Mountains, from an infinite number of crystal stones of an amazing size  with which they are covered and which, when"]]]
