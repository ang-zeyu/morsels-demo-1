According to some accounts,  it even evacuates the lining of the intestines with their contents.    A great variety of situations are chosen by the different species at  this time. Some will fix themselves on their own food plant, and there  remain till they finally emerge in the perfect state, suspending  themselves from a silken carpet, hiding themselves in a rolled leaf, or  constructing a cocoon of some kind. A large number walk down the food  plants, and undergo their changes in moss that happens to lie at the  foot; or construct a cocoon on the surface of the ground, utilising for  the purpose any decayed leaves, fragments of vegetable matter, or pieces  of earth or small stones. Many seek a further protection than this, and  burrow into the soil, where they either lie in a little oval cell that  they prepare, or in a cocoon constructed by spinning together some  particles of earth. Again, there are those caterpillars, chiefly of  butterflies that frequent our gardens, which find their way to the  nearest wall or fence, and there secure themselves in a sheltered nook.  We will watch a few of these varied methods of procedure, taking as our  first instance the caterpillar of the common Large White or Cabbage  Butterfly.    When fully fed, this larva seeks out a sheltered spot, generally  selecting the under surface of some object, or of the ledge of a wall or  fence. Sometimes it will not even leave its food plant, though it  generally walks some considerable distance before a suitable shelter is  found. Having satisfied itself as to the site of the temporary abode, it  sets to work at spinning a silken carpet. At first the threads spread  over a rather wide area, and seem to be laid in a somewhat irregular and  aimless manner; but after a little time its labours are concentrated on  one small spot, where it spins several layers of silk fibres.    This done, it fixes the little hooks of the claspers firmly in its  carpet bed, and then proceeds with a highly interesting movement. It is  not satisfied with only the one mode of suspension. In fact, this alone  would hardly be safe, for when it casts its skin, as it is shortly about  to do, its claspers will all disappear; and although it afterwards  secures itself by the 'tail,' it would be dangling in such a manner as  to swing with every breeze--a very unsatisfactory state of affairs,  especially with those that pupate late in the summer and remain in the  pupal state throughout the winter storms.    Its next procedure, then, is to make a strong silk band round the middle  of its body, so as to keep it close to the surface against which it  rests. But how is this to be done? It bends its head round till the  spinning organ can be applied to a point close beside the middle of its  body. Here it fixes one end of a thread; and then, gradually twisting  its body, brings its head round to the other side, still keeping it  close to the same segment, and fastens the other end of the thread  exactly opposite the point at which it started.    The head is now brought back to its former position, thus adding another  thread to the band; and the process is repeated several times, till at  last the caterpillar is satisfied with the thickness and strength of the  cord formed.    Now it straightens out its body as if to rest from its labours; but the  work is not yet complete. Soon it exhibits much restlessness. Its  foremost segments are seen to shorten, and consequently become thicker.  Then the skin splits, and the last moult of the caterpillar commences.  The movements that follow are exactly similar to those we have already  described in connection with one of the earlier moults: the alternate  and successive contractions of all the segments gradually force back the  old coat, and this is finally thrown entirely off by a somewhat vigorous  wriggling of the 'tail.'    Then, for a moment, the creature is supported only by its silken cord.  But this lasts _only_ for a moment. For, as soon as it is quite free  from the old garment, it applies its tail to the densest part of the  carpet it had prepared at the start, and secures its hinder extremity by  means of little hooks.    But what a change has now come over the creature! It is no longer a  caterpillar. Its head is no longer distinct, although we can readily  make out the positions of the eyes. Its mouth and jaws have quite  disappeared, and the legs and claspers are apparently gone. The three  segments that bore the legs are no longer distinctly separable, though  in reality they still exist. The head and thorax are peculiarly shaped;  and, instead of being cylindrical, are angled and ridged; but, beneath  the soft greenish skin--the new garment--we can discern the outline of  a pair of small wings, and see a proboscis and a pair of long antennae.  Also the six long legs of the future butterfly can be traced with care.    The abdomen is conical in form, coming to a sharp point at the end, and  its segments are quite distinct.    No stranger to the metamorphoses of insects would connect the present  form with that of a caterpillar; they are so very unlike. And yet the  time occupied in the whole change, from the spinning of the carpet, does  not occupy more than about thirty or thirty-five hours.    The apparent suddenness of this change is really surprising, but in  reality the transformation is not nearly so sudden as it appears.  Dissection of a caterpillar a few days before the final moult is due  will show that the changes are already going on. In fact, a simple  removal of the skin will prove that the organs of the future butterfly  are developing. Still, in proportion to the short time occupied, the  change is extremely great; and it may reasonably be inquired, Why so  great a change within so short a space of time?--why is not the change  continued steadily and equally through the larval existence? The reason  has already been hinted at. Caterpillars are living eating machines,  whose office is to remove excess of vegetable matter. Consequently they  must have their jaws and bulky digestive apparatus in full development  to the end. If these organs were to _gradually_ disappear as the  caterpillar reaches its non-eating stages, it would simply be starved to  death. So the change from the larval to the pupal state, which we may  regard as the final moult of the caterpillar, is a far greater change  than any of the preceding ones, and occupies a proportionately longer  time, although it is principally confined to the last few days of the  caterpillar life.    A number of caterpillars, and especially those of the butterflies,  suspend themselves when about to change; and the peculiarities of the  modes adopted must be left for our descriptions of species in a future  chapter; but we will find room here for one more interesting example,  taking this time the larva of one of the commonest of the Vanessas (page  166)--the Small Tortoiseshell Butterfly.    The caterpillars of this insect are gregarious when young; and if ever  you meet with one, you are almost sure to be able to obtain a hundred or  so without much searching. But as they grow older they feed singly, yet  generally without straying very far from their birthplace.    When full grown they sometimes stray to a neighbouring plant or fence to  undergo the change to a chrysalis, but more commonly they are perfectly  satisfied with the protection afforded by the leaves of their food  plant. We will now watch one of these as we did the larva of the Large  White Butterfly.    Of course the under side of the leaf is chosen. Here a silken carpet is  spun as before described; but the caterpillar, instead of clinging with  _all_ its claspers, suspends itself in a vertical position by its  hindermost pair only.    Here it hangs, head downwards, awaiting the coming events. The splitting  and casting of the skin goes on just as in the case of the Large White,  but there is this puzzle to be solved: how can the insect shuffle itself  out of its old coat without falling to the ground, leaving the cast-off  garments still hanging by the hooks of the claspers? This really seems a  matter of impossibility, since the little hooks which alone suspend the  insect are thrown off with the skin of the claspers.    The thing is managed in this way. As the skin slowly splits through the  wrigglings of the apparently uncomfortable occupant, it is gradually  pushed backward--that is, upward--till it is in a shrivelled condition,  and the body of the insect is nearly free. But the chrysalis thus  brought to light is provided with little hooks on the end of its 'tail'  by which it can attach itself to the irregularities of the crumpled  coat. Its conical abdomen is also very flexible, and it can, by bending  this, seize hold of a ridge in the skin, holding it between the  segments. Thus, although practically quite free from the old garb, it  never falls to the ground.    There is now, however, another point to be attended to. The newly formed  chrysalis desires to be entirely independent of its cast-off skin, and  to suspend itself directly from the silky carpet it has prepared. To  this end it works steadily for a time, alternately bending its supple  abdomen from side to side, gripping the folds of the skin between the  segments, pulling its body a little higher at each movement, and  securing itself at each step by the little hooks at its extremity.    So it climbs, and at last it reaches the network of silk fibres, and  thrusts the tip of its abdomen among them till some of the hooks have  taken hold. Not satisfied with this, it turns its body round and round  to get the little hooks so entangled between the silk fibres that a fall  is impossible, and in so doing it frequently pushes the old skin out of  its place so that it falls to the ground.    Although the caterpillars of this species do not show any great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#11)"],[1," it is found to put her back  too much, she may be allowed to rest for a few months, or even a year,  to brings her up to the desired standard. These remarks apply  principally to choice breeders, or as they are sometimes termed, _fancy  stock_. For ordinary milch cows which have been moderately fed, three  years is a proper age to come in, after which they must be milked as  regularly, and as late before drying as possible.      Breaking Steers    Should be commenced when two or three years old. Some begin with the  calf, accustoming him to a light yoke and occasional training. This  practice will do as a pastime for trustworthy boys, as it makes them  gentle and manageable afterwards, but is hardly worth a man's time. If  always carefully handled when young, they will be found tractable.    They should at first be placed behind a pair of well-broke cattle, nor  should they be put to hard labor until quite grown, strong, and  perfectly accustomed to the yoke. If properly managed, cattle may be  trained with all the docility, intelligence, and much of the activity of  the horse. That they are not, is more frequently the fault of their  masters.      Management of Oxen.    To procure perfect working cattle, it is necessary to begin with the  proper breed. Many parts of the country furnish such as are well suited  to this purpose. A strong dash of Devon or Hereford blood is desirable,  when it needs to be improved. A well-formed, compact, muscular body;  clean, sinewy limbs; strong, dense bones; large, well-formed joints,  with a mild expressive eye, are essential for good working oxen.    After breaking, they must be led along gently, and taught before they  are required to perform their task; and never put to a load which they  cannot readily move, nor dulled by prolonging exertion beyond that  period when it becomes irksome. A generous diet is necessary, to keep up  the spirit and ability of cattle, when there is hard work to be done.  The horse and mule are fed with their daily rations of grain when at  hard service, and if the spirit of the ox is to be maintained, he  should be equally well fed, when as fully employed. Great and permanent  injury is the result of niggardly feeding and severe toil, exacted from  the uncomplaining animal. His strength declines, his spirit flags, and  if this treatment be continued, he rapidly becomes the stupid, moping  brute, which is shown off in degrading contrast with the more spirited  horse, that performs, it may be, one half the labor, on twice his  rations.    The ox should be as little abused by threats and whipping, as by stinted  feed and overtasked labor. Loud and repeated hallooing, or the severe  use of the lash, is as impolitic as it is cruel and disgraceful. We  never witness this barbarity without wishing the brutes could change  places, long enough at least to teach the biped that humanity by his own  sufferings which his reason and sensibility have failed to inspire.  Clear and intelligible, yet low and gentle words are all that are  necessary to guide the well-trained, spirited ox. The stick, or whip, is  needed rather to indicate the precise movement desired, than as a  stimulant or means of punishment. The ox understands a moderate tone  more perfectly than a boisterous one, for all sounds become indistinct  as they increase.    It is of great advantage to have oxen well trained to _backing_. They  may soon be taught, by beginning with an empty cart on a descent; then  on a level; then with an increasing load, or uphill, till the cattle  will back nearly the same load they will draw.    Some oxen have a bad trick of _hauling_ or _crowding_. Changing to  opposite sides, longer or shorter yokes, and more than all, gentle  treatment, are the only remedies, and those not unfrequently fail.  Cattle will seldom contract this habit, in the hands of a judicious,  careful driver. _The yokes_ should be carefully made, and set easy, and  the bows fitted to the necks and properly attached to the yoke. Cattle  are liable to sore necks if used in a storm; and when subject to this  exposure, they must be well rubbed with grease, where the yoke chafes  them, and respite from work should be allowed till the necks heal.      Management of Bulls or Vicious Animals.    If inclined to be vicious, the bulls should have rings thrust through  the cartilage of their nose when young. They are to be found at the  agricultural warehouses; and are made of round iron, three-eighths of an  inch diameter, with a joint in one side to open, and when thrust through  the nose, are fastened in a moment, by a rivet previously prepared.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.    Cattle-Handler.]    Fig. 5 is a _cattle-handler_, consisting of a bar of iron A, eight  inches long, with a ring for a man's hand, which turns on a swivel at B,  and at the other end is a pair of calliper-shaped legs, one stationary,  and the other opening on a joint. The fixed leg is inserted against one  side of the nostril, and the other is pressed upon the opposite side,  and there fastened by a slide, C, when the animal is firmly held for  administering medicine or performing any operation.    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Fig. 7.    For taming savage Animals.]    Figs. 6 and 7, for _taming a bull_; b, in Fig. 6, is a cap screwed on to  the tip of the horn; a c, an iron rod hanging on a pivot in the cap,  with a chain reaching to the ring in the nose. The effect of his  attempting to hook, is illustrated by the various positions of the chain  in Fig. 7. If the rod at a, is pushed in either direction, it jerks up  the nose in a manner that cures him of his inclination.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.    Cattle-Tie.]    Fig. 8, shows a _cattle-tie_.--This is a much more convenient and  comfortable mode of fastening cattle in the stable, than the common  stanchions.      The proper time for turning off Cattle.    This must depend on their previous feeding and management, the breed,  and the purposes required. The improved breeds and many of their  crosses, will mature for the butcher as fully at three or four, as  inferior cattle at five to seven years old. If pushed rapidly with  proper food, they will of course be _ripe_ much sooner than if stinted.  When cattle have to be purchased for work, or cows for the dairy, it  becomes an object to keep them as long as they can be made profitable,  and yet be turned off for fattening at a fair price. We have seen active  and spirited oxen in the yoke at 16 or 17; but they seldom do as well  after 12 or even 10 years. Old cattle are liable to more diseases than  young; are less hardy; and they recover more slowly when exposed to  scanty feed or hard usage. They also fatten with more difficulty, and  their meat is inferior. When they can be sold advantageously to the  feeder, and replaced without inconvenience, it is found to be most  profitable to turn them off at seven or eight years. They will by that  time have attained full maturity; they will feed rapidly, and make the  largest amount of good beef. If there are extraordinary milkers among  the cows, or superior workers among the oxen, it is better to keep them  as long as they maintain their full vigor.      Fattening Cattle.    Such as are designed for the shambles the ensuing fall or winter, may be  allowed to do their spring's labor; or if cows, they may be milked into  summer after calving, or go farrow during the previous year. They should  early be put on the best summer feed, and it is better to be  occasionally changed, to give variety and freshness, and keep the animal  in good appetite. Let the fattening animals have the best, and after  they have cropped it a while, give them a fresh field; and the other  animals or sheep can follow and clear off the remaining herbage,  preparatory to shutting it up for a new growth. Some prefer an extensive  range of rich feed, which is unchanged throughout the season; and when  it is not necessary to divide the pasture with the other animals, this  is a good practice.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    Three cuts of improved forms, Nos. 9, 10, and 11. The above cuts  illustrate the forms which the most improved beef-cattle should possess.      The selection of Animals for Stall Fattening.    This is a nice point, and none without a practised eye and touch, can  choose such as will make the best return for the food consumed. The  characteristics of choice animals, heretofore enumerated, are  particularly essential in those intended for profitable fattening. But  the most important of all, is that firm mellowness, and quick elasticity  of touch, which unerringly mark the kindly feeder and profitable  bullock. When other means for ascertaining fail, it is a safe rule to  select the best-conditioned animals, out of a herd of grass-fed; for if  all were of equal flesh and health, when turned out, those which have  thriven most on their summer pasture, will generally fatten quickest on  their fall and winter keep. Only the best should be selected. The  remainder, after consuming the coarser forage, may be at once disposed  of for early use. From repeated trials, it is found that the carcass of  stall-fed animals will barely return the value of the materials  consumed, and their manure is generally the only compensation for the  time and attention bestowed. None but choice, thrifty beasts will pay  for their food and attention, and all others will make their best  returns, by an immediate disposal, after the surplus fodder is gone.
