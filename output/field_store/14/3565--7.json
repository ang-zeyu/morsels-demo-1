Being myself a Picard born, I was always  very fond of the Artesian women, and it is only a step from Artois to  Flanders; she came crying bitterly to her godfather, my predecessor  in the Rue des Lombards; she placed her two thousand florins in my  establishment, which I have turned to very good account, and which have  brought her in ten thousand.\"    \"Bravo, Planchet.\"    \"She is free and well off; she has a cow, a maid servant and old  Celestin at her orders; she mends my linen, knits my winter stockings;  she only sees me every fortnight, and seems to make herself in all  things tolerably happy.    \"And indeed, gentlemen, I _am_ very happy and comfortable,\" said  Truchen, with perfect ingenuousness.    Porthos began to curl the other side of his mustache. \"The deuce,\"  thought D'Artagnan, \"can Porthos have any intentions in that quarter?\"    In the meantime Truchen had set her cook to work, had laid the table for  two more, and covered it with every possible delicacy that could convert  a light supper into a substantial meal, a meal into a regular feast.  Fresh butter, salt beef, anchovies, tunny, a shopful of Planchet's  commodities, fowls, vegetables, salad, fish from the pond and the  river, game from the forest--all the produce, in fact, of the province.  Moreover, Planchet returned from the cellar, laden with ten bottles of  wine, the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of  dust which covered them. Porthos's heart began to expand as he said, \"I  am hungry,\" and he sat himself beside Madame Truchen, whom he looked at  in the most killing manner. D'Artagnan seated himself on the other side  of her, while Planchet, discreetly and full of delight, took his seat  opposite.    \"Do not trouble yourselves,\" he said, \"if Truchen should leave the  table now and then during supper; for she will have to look after your  bedrooms.\"    In fact, the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently, and they  could hear, on the first floor above them, the creaking of the wooden  bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor. While this  was going on, the three men, Porthos especially, ate and drank  gloriously,--it was wonderful to see them. The ten full bottles were ten  empty ones by the time Truchen returned with the cheese. D'Artagnan  still preserved his dignity and self-possession, but Porthos had lost  a portion of his; and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious.  D'Artagnan recommended a new descent into the cellar, and, as Planchet  no longer walked with the steadiness of a well-trained foot-soldier,  the captain of the musketeers proposed to accompany him. They set off,  humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening.  Truchen remained behind at table with Porthos. While the two  wine-bibbers were looking behind the firewood for what they wanted, a  sharp report was heard like the impact of a pair of lips on a lady's  cheek.    \"Porthos fancies himself at La Rochelle,\" thought D'Artagnan, as they  returned freighted with bottles. Planchet was singing so loudly that  he was incapable of noticing anything. D'Artagnan, whom nothing ever  escaped, remarked how much redder Truchen's left cheek was than her  right. Porthos was sitting on Truchen's left, and was curling with both  his hands both sides of his mustache at once, and Truchen was looking at  him with a most bewitching smile. The sparkling wine of Anjou very soon  produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions. D'Artagnan had  hardly strength enough left to take a candlestick to light Planchet up  his own staircase. Planchet was pulling Porthos along, who was following  Truchen, who was herself jovial enough. It was D'Artagnan who found out  the rooms and the beds. Porthos threw himself into the one destined for  him, after his friend had undressed him. D'Artagnan got into his own  bed, saying to himself, \"_Mordioux!_ I had made up my mind never to  touch that light-colored wine, which brings my early camp days back  again. Fie! fie! if my musketeers were only to see their captain in such  a state.\" And drawing the curtains of his bed, he added, \"Fortunately  enough, though, they will not see me.\"    \"The country is very amusing,\" said Porthos, stretching out his legs,  which passed through the wooden footboard, and made a tremendous  crash, of which, however, no one in the house was capable of taking  the slightest notice. By two o'clock in the morning every one was fast  asleep.        Chapter VI. Showing What Could Be Seen from Planchet's House.    The next morning found the three heroes sleeping soundly. Truchen had  closed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from the  leaden-lidded eyes of her guests, like a kind, good housekeeper. It  was still perfectly dark, then, beneath Porthos's curtains and under  Planchet's canopy, when D'Artagnan, awakened by an indiscreet ray of  light which made its way through a peek-hole in the shutters, jumped  hastily out of bed, as if he wished to be the first at a forlorn hope.  He took by assault Porthos's room, which was next to his own. The worthy  Porthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder; in the dim  obscurity of the room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed, and  his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet. D'Artagnan  awoke Porthos, who rubbed his eyes in a tolerably good humor. In the  meantime Planchet was dressing himself, and met at their bedroom doors  his two guests, who were still somewhat unsteady from their previous  evening's entertainment. Although it was yet very early, the whole  household was already up. The cook was mercilessly slaughtering in  the poultry-yard; Celestin was gathering white cherries in the garden.  Porthos, brisk and lively as ever, held out his hand to Planchet's, and  D'Artagnan requested permission to embrace Madame Truchen. The latter,  to show that she bore no ill-will, approached Porthos, upon whom she  conferred the same favor. Porthos embraced Madame Truchen, heaving an  enormous sigh. Planchet took both his friends by the hand.    \"I am going to show you over the house,\" he said; \"when we arrived last  night it was as dark as an oven, and we were unable to see anything;  but in broad daylight, everything looks different, and you will be  satisfied, I hope.\"    \"If we begin by the view you have here,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that charms  me beyond everything; I have always lived in royal mansions, you know,  and royal personages have tolerably sound ideas upon the selection of  points of view.\"    \"I am a great stickler for a good view myself,\" said Porthos. \"At my  Chateau de Pierrefonds, I have had four avenues laid out, and at the  end of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the  others.\"    \"You shall see _my_ prospect,\" said Planchet; and he led his two guests  to a window.    \"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is the Rue de Lyon.\"    \"Yes, I have two windows on this side, a paltry, insignificant view,  for there is always that bustling and noisy inn, which is a very  disagreeable neighbor. I had four windows here, but I bricked up two.\"    \"Let us go on,\" said D'Artagnan.    They entered a corridor leading to the bedrooms, and Planchet pushed  open the outside blinds.    \"Hollo! what is that out yonder?\" said Porthos.    \"The forest,\" said Planchet. \"It is the horizon,--a thick line of green,  which is yellow in the spring, green in the summer, red in the autumn,  and white in the winter.\"    \"All very well, but it is like a curtain, which prevents one seeing a  greater distance.\"    \"Yes,\" said Planchet; \"still, one can see, at all events, everything  that intervenes.\"    \"Ah, the open country,\" said Porthos. \"But what is that I see out  there,--crosses and stones?\"    \"Ah, that is the cemetery,\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.    \"Precisely,\" said Planchet; \"I assure you it is very curious. Hardly a  day passes that some one is not buried there; for Fontainebleau is by no  means an inconsiderable place. Sometimes we see young girls clothed in  white carrying banners; at others, some of the town-council, or rich  citizens, with choristers and all the parish authorities; and then, too,  we see some of the officers of the king's household.\"    \"I should not like that,\" said Porthos.    \"There is not much amusement in it, at all events,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"I assure you it encourages religious thoughts,\" replied Planchet.    \"Oh, I don't deny that.\"    \"But,\" continued Planchet, \"we must all die one day or another, and  I once met with a maxim somewhere which I have remembered, that the  thought of death is a thought that will do us all good.\"    \"I am far from saying the contrary,\" said Porthos.    \"But,\" objected D'Artagnan, \"the thought of green fields, flowers,  rivers, blue horizons, extensive and boundless plains, is not likely to  do us good.\"    \"If I had any, I should be far from rejecting them,\" said Planchet; \"but  possessing only this little cemetery, full of flowers, so moss-grown,  shady, and quiet, I am contented with it, and I think of those who live  in town, in the Rue des Lombards, for instance, and who have to listen  to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day, and to  the soulless tramp, tramp, tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand  foot-passengers.\"    \"But living,\" said Porthos; \"living, remember that.\"    \"That is exactly the reason,\" said Planchet, timidly, \"why I feel it  does me good to contemplate a few dead.\"    \"Upon my word,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that fellow Planchet is born a  philosopher as well as a grocer.\"    \"Monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"I am one of those good-humored sort of men  whom Heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days,  and of considering all good they meet with during their transitory stay  on earth.\"    D'Artagnan sat down close to the window, and as there seemed to be  something substantial in Planchet's philosophy, he mused"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27118"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 2, April 1906 (#11)"],[1,".    RITA (_to herself_): He does not love me any more. (_Loudly_) But during  that time he might have at least repaired the bell. He is of no use  whatever. (_She laughs._)    BERTHA: The Count came directly from the matinee and asked me where your  ladyship had gone to dine. Naturally I did not know.    RITA: Did he ask--anything else?    BERTHA: No, he looked at the photographs.    RITA (_in the door_): Well? And does he expect to come again to-day?    BERTHA: Yes, certainly. At four o'clock.    RITA (_looks at the clock_): Oh, but that's boring. Now it is already  half-past three. One cannot even drink coffee in peace. Hurry, Bertha,  prepare the coffee.    (_Bertha leaves the room, carrying the articles of attire._)    (_Rita, after a pause, singing a melancholy melody._)    (_Friedrich Stierwald, a man very carefully dressed in black, about  thirty years of age, with a black crepe around his stiff hat, enters  from the rear into the antechamber, followed by Bertha._)    BERTHA: But the lady is not well.    FRIEDRICH: Please tell the lady that I am passing through here, and that  I must speak with her about a very pressing matter. It is absolutely  necessary. Please! (_He gives her money and his card._)    BERTHA: Yes, I shall take your card, but I fear she will not receive  you.    FRIEDRICH: Why not? O, yes! Just go----    BERTHA: This morning she sang at a charity matinee and so----    FRIEDRICH: I know, I know. Listen! (_Rita's singing has grown louder_)  Don't you hear how she sings? Oh, do go!    BERTHA (_shaking her head_): Well, then--wait a moment. (_She passes  through the room to the half-opened door of the sleeping apartment,  knocks_) Dear lady!    RITA (_from within_): Well? What's the matter?    BERTHA (_at the door_): Oh, this gentleman here--he wishes to see you  very much. He is passing through here.    RITA (_within; laughs_): Come in.    (_Bertha disappears._)    (_Friedrich has walked up to the middle door, where he remains  standing._)    RITA: Well. Who is it? Friedrich---- Hmm---- I shall come immediately.    BERTHA (_comes out and looks at Friedrich in surprise_): My lady wishes  you to await her. (_She walks away, after having taken another glance at  Friedrich._)    (_Friedrich looks about embarrassed and shyly._)    (_Rita enters attired in a tasteful dressing gown, but remains standing  in the door._)    FRIEDRICH (_bows; softly_): Good day.    (_Rita looks at him with an ironical smile and remains silent._)    FRIEDRICH: You remember me? Don't you?    RITA (_quietly_): Strange. You--come to see me? What has become of your  good training? (_Laughs._) Have you lost all sense of shame?    FRIEDRICH (_stretches out his hand, as if imploring_): Oh, I beg of you,  I beg of you; not this tone! I really came to explain everything to you,  everything. And possibly to set things aright.    RITA: You--with me! (_She shakes her head._) Incredible! But, please,  since you are here, sit down. With what can you serve me?    FRIEDRICH (_seriously_): Miss Hattenbach, I really should----    RITA (_lightly_): Pardon me, my name is Revera. Rita Revera.    FRIEDRICH: I know that you call yourself by that name now. But you won't  expect me, an old friend of your family, to make use of this romantic,  theatrical name. For me you are now, as heretofore, the daughter of the  esteemed house of Hattenbach, with which I----    RITA (_quickly and sharply_): With which your father transacts business,  I know.    FRIEDRICH (_with emphasis_): With which I now am myself associated.    RITA: Is it possible? And your father?    FRIEDRICH (_seriously_): If I had the slightest inkling of your address,  yes, even your present name, I should not have missed to announce to you  the sudden death of my father.    RITA (_after pause_): Oh, he is dead. I see you still wear mourning. How  long ago is it?    FRIEDRICH: Half a year. Since then I am looking for you, and I hope you  will not forbid me to address you now, as of yore, with that name, which  is so highly esteemed in our native city.    RITA (_smiling friendly_): Your solemnity--is delightful. Golden! But  sit down.    FRIEDRICH (_remains standing; he is hurt_): I must confess, Miss  Hattenbach, that I was not prepared for such a reception from you. I  hoped that I might expect, after these four or five years, that you  would receive me differently than with this--with this--how shall I say?    RITA: Toleration.    FRIEDRICH: No, with this arrogance.    RITA: How?    FRIEDRICH (_controlling himself_): I beg your pardon. I am sorry to have  said that.    RITA (_after a pause, hostile_): You wish to be taken seriously? (_She  sits down, with a gesture of the hand_) Please, what have you to say to  me?    FRIEDRICH: Much. Oh, very much. (_He also sits down._) But--you are not  well to-day?    RITA: Not well? What makes you say so?    FRIEDRICH: Yes, the maid told me so.    RITA: The maid--she is a useful person. That makes me think. You  certainly expect to stay here some time, do you not?    FRIEDRICH: With your permission. I have much to tell you.    RITA: I thought so. (_Calling loudly_) Bertha! Bertha! Do you suppose  one could get an electric bell repaired here? Impossible.    BERTHA (_enters_): My lady?    RITA: Bertha, when the Count comes--now I am really sick.    BERTHA (_nods_): Very well. (_She leaves._)    RITA (_calls after her_): And where is the coffee? I shall famish.    BERTHA (_outside_): Immediately.    FRIEDRICH: The--the Count--did you say?    RITA: Yes, quite a fine fellow otherwise, but--would not fit in now. I  wanted to say: I am passionately fond of electric bells. You know they  have a fabulous charm for me. One only needs to touch them softly, ever  so softly, with the small finger, and still cause a terrible noise.  Fine--is it not? You wanted to talk about serious matters. It seems so  to me.    FRIEDRICH: Yes. And I beg of you, Miss Erna----    RITA: Erna?    FRIEDRICH: Erna!    RITA: Oh, well!    FRIEDRICH (_continuing_): I beg of you; be really and truly serious.  Yes? Listen to what I have to say to you. Be assured that it comes from  an honest, warm heart. During the years in which I have not seen you, I  have grown to be a serious man--perhaps, too serious for my age--but my  feelings for you have remained young, quite young. Do you hear me, Erna?    RITA (_leaning back in the rocking chair, with a sigh_): I hear.    FRIEDRICH: And you know, Erna, how I have always loved you from my  earliest youth, yes, even sooner than I myself suspected. You know that,  yes?    (_Rita is silent and does not look at him_.)    FRIEDRICH: When I was still a foolish schoolboy I already called you my  betrothed, and I could not but think otherwise than that I would some  day call you my wife. You certainly know that, don't you?    RITA (_reserved_): Yes, I know it.    FRIEDRICH: Well, then you ought to be able to understand what dreadful  feelings overcame me when I discovered, sooner than you or the world,  the affection of my father for you. That was--no, you cannot grasp it.    RITA (_looks at him searchingly_): Sooner than I and all the world?    FRIEDRICH: Oh, a great deal sooner ... that was.... That time was the  beginning of the hardest innermost struggles for me. What was I to do?  (_He sighs deeply_.) Ah, Miss Erna, we people are really----    RITA: Yes, yes.    FRIEDRICH: We are dreadfully shallow-minded. How seldom one of us can  really live as he would like to. Must we not always and forever consider  others--and our surroundings?    RITA: Must?    FRIEDRICH: Well, yes, we do so, at least. And when it is our own father!  For, look here, Erna, I never would have been able to oppose my father!  I was used, as you well know, from childhood to always look up to my  father with the greatest respect. He used to be severe, my father, proud  and inaccessible, but--if I may be permitted to say so, he was an  excellent man.    RITA: Well?    FRIEDRICH (_eagerly_): Yes, indeed! You must remember that it was he  alone who established our business by means of his powerful energy and  untiring diligence. Only now I myself have undertaken the management of  the establishment. I am able to see what an immense work he has  accomplished.    RITA (_simply_): Yes, he was an able business man.    FRIEDRICH: In every respect! Ability personified, and he had grown to be  fifty-two years of age and was still, still--how shall I say?    RITA: Still able.    FRIEDRICH: Well, yes; I mean a vigorous man in his best years. For  fifteen years he had been a widower, he had worked, worked unceasingly,  and then--the house was well established--he could think of placing some  of the work upon younger shoulders. He could think of enjoying his life  once more.    RITA (_softly_): That is----    FRIEDRICH (_continuing_): And he thought he had found, in you, the one  who would bring back to him youth and the joy of life.    RITA (_irritated_): Yes, but then you ought to--(_Breaks off._) Oh, it  is not worth while.    FRIEDRICH: How? I should have been man enough to say: No, I forbid it;  that is a folly of age. I, your son, forbid it. I demand her for myself.  The young fortune is meant for me--not for you?----No, Erna, I could  not do that. I could not do that.    RITA: No.    FRIEDRICH: I, the young clerk, with no future before me!    RITA: No!    FRIEDRICH: My entire training and my conceptions urged me to consider it  my duty to simply stand aside and stifle my affection, as I did--as I  already told you even before any other person had an idea of the  intentions of my father. I gradually grew away from you.    RITA (_amused_): Gradually--yes, I recollect. You suddenly became  formal. Indeed, very nice!    FRIEDRICH: I thought----    (_Bertha comes with the coffee and serves._)    RITA: Will you take a cup with me?    FRIEDRICH (_thoughtlessly_): I thought----(_Correcting himself_) pardon  me! I thank you!    RITA: I hope it will not disturb you if I drink my"]]]
