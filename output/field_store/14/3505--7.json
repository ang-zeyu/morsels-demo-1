Tamara, frightened calls her companions and they all return  to the castle, but the words of the stranger, whom she has recognized  by the halo of light surrounding him, as a being from a higher world,  vibrate in her ears: \"Queen of my love, thou shalt be the Empress of  Worlds.\"    The following scene shows Prince Sinodal, encamping for the night with  his suite; the roughness of the way has delayed his coming to Tamara.  Near the camp is a chapel, erected in memory of one of his ancestors,  who was slain there by a ruffian and the Prince's old servant  admonishes him to pray for his soul.  To his destruction he postpones  it till morning, for during his sleep the Demon brings up his enemies,  the Tartars, and the Prince's caravan is robbed and he himself killed.    {51}    In the second act Tamara stands ready to receive her bridegroom, whose  coming has been announced to her by a messenger.    Tamara's thoughts are with the stranger, though against her will, when  an escort brings the dead body of Sinodal.  While the poor bride is  giving vent to her sorrow and her father seeks to comfort her by  offering religious consolation, she again hears the voice of the Demon,  whispering soft seductions to her.  At last she feels that her strength  is failing before a supernatural power, and so she begs her father to  let her enter a monastery.  After offering many objections he finally  consents, for in truth his thoughts are only of avenging his children.    In the third act the Demon, who really loves Tamara, and regrets his  wickedness, seeks to see her.  The Angel of Light denies him the  entrance, which however he finally forces.  Passionately he invokes  Tamara's pity and her love and she, rent by unutterable feelings  implores Heaven's aid, but her strength gives way, and the Demon  embraces and kisses her.  At this moment the Angel of Light appears,  and Tamara is about to hasten to him, when with a loud cry she sinks  down lifeless.  Satan has lost; despairing and cursing all, he vanishes  and a thunder-bolt destroys the cloister, from amid the ruins of which  the Angels bear the poor love-tortured Tamara to Heaven.        {52}    LE DOMINO NOIR.    Comic Opera in three acts by AUBER.    Text by SCRIBE.      This is one of the most charming comic operas, which were ever written  by this master.  Graceful archness and elegance of style are its  characteristics, and these lose nothing from the presence of a gay and  easy temper which makes itself felt throughout.  The same may be said  of the libretto.    The plot is well worked out and entertaining.  The scene is laid in  Madrid in our century.    The Queen of Spain gives a masqued ball, at which our heroine Angela is  present, accompanied by her companion Brigitta.  There she is seen by  Horatio di Massarena, a young nobleman, who had met her a year before  at one of these balls and fell in love with, without knowing her.    This time he detains her, but is again unable to discover her real  name, and confessing his love for her, he receives the answer, that she  can be no more than a friend to him.  Massarena detains her so long  that the clock strikes the midnight-hour as Angela prepares to seek her  companion.  Massarena confesses to having removed Brigitta under some  pretext, and Angela in despair cries out, that she is lost.  She is in  reality member of a convent, and destined to be Lady-Abbess, though she  has not yet taken the vows.  She is very highly connected, and has  secretly helped Massarena to advance in his career as a {53}  diplomatist.--Great is her anxiety to return in her convent after  midnight, but she declines all escort, and walking alone through the  streets, she comes by chance into the house of Count Juliano, a  gentleman of somewhat uncertain character, and Massarena's friend.  Juliano is just giving a supper to his gay friends and Angela bribes  his housekeeper Claudia, to keep her for the night.  She appears before  the guests disguised as an Arragonian waiting-maid, and charms them  all, and particularly Massarena with her grace and coquetry.  But as  the young gentlemen begin to be insolent, she disappears, feeling  herself in danger of being recognized.  Massarena, discovering in her  the charming black domino, is very unhappy to see her in such  company.--Meanwhile Angela succeeds in getting the keys of the convent  from Gil-Perez, the porter, who had also left his post, seduced by his  love of gormandizing and had come to pay court to Claudia.  Angela  troubles his conscience and frightens him with her black mask, and  flies.  When she has gone, the house-keeper confesses that her  pretended Arragonian was a stranger, by all appearance a noble lady,  who sought refuge in Juliano's house.    In the third act Angela reaches the convent, but not without having had  some more adventures.  Through Brigitta's cleverness her absence has  not been discovered.  At length the day has come when she is to be made  Lady-Abbess and she is arrayed in the attire suited to her future high  office, when Massarena is announced to her.--He comes to {54} ask to be  relieved from a marriage with Ursula, Lord Elfort's daughter, who is  destined for him, and who is also an inmate of the convent, but whom he  cannot love.  Notwithstanding her disguise he recognizes his beloved  domino, who, happily for both is released by the Queen from her high  mission and permitted to choose a husband.--Of course it is no other,  than the happy Massarena; while Ursula is consoled by being made  Lady-Abbess, a position which well suits her ambitious temper.          DON CARLOS.    Opera in four acts by VERDI.    Text by MERY and CAMILLA DU LOCLE.      This opera is one of the first of Verdi's.  It was half forgotten, when  being suddenly recalled to the stage it met with considerable success.  The music is fine and highly dramatic in many parts.    The scene of action lies in Spain.  Don Carlos, Crown-prince of Spain  comes to the convent of St. Just, where his grand-father, the Emperor  Charles the Fifth has just been buried.  Carlos bewails his separation  from his step-mother, Elizabeth of Valois, whom he loves with a sinful  passion.  His friend, the Marquis Posa reminds him of his duty and  induces him to leave Spain for Flanders, where an unhappy nation sighs  under the cruel rule of King Philip's governors.--Carlos has an  interview with the Queen, but beside himself with grief he again  declares his love, though having resolved only to ask for her  intervention with the King, on {55} behalf of his mission to Flanders.  Elizabeth asks him to think of duty and dismisses him.  Just then her  jealous husband enters, and finding her lady of honor, Countess  Aremberg, absent, banishes the latter from Spain.  King Philip favors  Posa with his particular confidence, though the latter is secretly the  friend of Carlos, who is ever at variance with his wicked father.  Posa  uses his influence with the King for the best of the people, and  Philip, putting entire confidence in him, orders him to watch his wife.    The second act represents a fete in the royal gardens at Madrid, where  Carlos mistakes the Princess Eboli for the Queen and betrays his  unhappy love.  The Princess, loving Carlos herself, and having nurtured  hopes of her love being responded to, takes vengeance.  She possesses  herself of a casket in which the Queen keeps Carlos' portrait, a  love-token from her maiden-years, and surrenders it to Philip.  The  King, though conscious of his wife's innocence, is more than ever  jealous of his son, and seeks for an occasion to put him out of the  way.  It is soon found, when Carlos defies him at an autodafe of  heretics.  Posa himself is obliged to deprive Carlos of his sword, and  the latter is imprisoned.  The King has an interview with the  Grand-Inquisitor, who demands the death of Don Carlos, asserting him to  be a traitor to his country.  As Philip demurs, the priest asks Posa's  life as the more dangerous of the two.  The King, who never loved a  human being except Posa, the {56} pure-hearted Knight, yields to the  power of the church.    In the following scene Elizabeth, searching for her casket, is accused  of infidelity by her husband.  The Princess Eboli, seeing the trouble  her mischievous jealousy has brought upon her innocent mistress,  penitently confesses her fault and is banished from court.  In the last  scene of the third act Carlos is visited by Posa, who explains to him,  that he has only imprisoned him in order to save him, and that he has  announced to the King, that it was himself, Posa, who excited rebellion  in Flanders.  While they speak, Posa is shot by an arquebusier of the  royal guard; Philip enters the cell to present his sword to Carlos, but  the son turns from his father with loathing and explains his friend's  pious fraud.  While Philip bewails the loss of the best man in Spain,  loud acclamations are heard from the people, who hearing that their  prince is in danger desire to see him.    In the last act the Queen, who promised Posa to watch over Carlos,  meets him once more in the convent of St. Just.  They are surprised by  the King, who approaches, accompanied by the Grand-Inquisitor, and into  his hands the unhappy Carlos is at last delivered.    {57}    DON JUAN.    Opera in two acts by MOZART.    Text by DA PONTE.      Don Juan is Mozart's most beautiful opera; we may even say, that it is  the greatest work of this kind, which was ever written by a German  musician.  The text too, written by Mozart's friend, is far above the  level of ordinary opera-texts.    The hero, spoilt by fortune and blase, is ever growing more reckless.  He even dares to attack the virtue of Donna Anna, one of the first  ladies of a city in Spain, of which her father, an old Spanish Grandee,  as noble and as strict in virtue as Don Juan is oversatiated and  frivolous, is governor.  The old father "]]]
