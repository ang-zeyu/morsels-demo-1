Well-meaning people have even attempted to prove that Capital and Labor  are twins, and that in order to maintain their common interests they  ought to live in harmony; or, that if Sister Labor had a grievance  against its big brother it ought to be settled in a calm and peaceful  way. Meanwhile the dear sister was fleeced and bled by Brother Capital,  and every time the abused and slaved and outraged creature would turn to  her brother for justice the dear fellow would whip the rebellious child  into submission.    Along with the forcible subjection of organized labor, the minds of the  people were confused and blurred by the sugar-coated promises of  politicians who assured them that the trade unions ought to be organized  by the law, and that all labor quarrels ought to be settled by political  and legal means. Indeed, legislatures even discussed a few  labor-protective laws that either never saw the light of day, or, if  really enacted, were set aside or overridden by the possessing class as  an obstacle to profit-making.    Every government, no matter what political basis it rests upon, acts in  unison with wealth, and therefore it never passed any legislation in  behalf of the producing element of the country that would seriously  benefit the great bulk of the people or in any way aim at any change of  wage-slaving or economic subjugation.    Every step of improvement the workingmen have made is due solely to  their own economic efforts and not to any legal or political aid ever  given them, and through their own endeavors only can ever come the  reconstruction of the economic and social conditions of society. Just as  little as the workingmen can expect from legislative methods can they  gain from trade-unionistic efforts that attempt to better economic  conditions along the basic lines of the present industrial system.    The cardinal fault of the trade-union movement of this country lies in  the fact that its hopes and ideals rest upon the present social status;  these ideals ever rotate in the same circle and, therefore, cannot bear  intellectual and material fruit. Condemned to pasture in the lean  meadows of capitalistic economy, trade-unionism drags on a miserable  existence, satisfied with the crumbs that fall from the heavily laden  tables of their lordly masters.    True social science has amply proved the futility of a reconciliation  between the two opposing forces; the existence of the one force  representing possession, wealth and power inevitably has a paralyzing  effect upon its opposing force--Labor.    Trade-unionistic tactics of to-day unfortunately still travel the path  marked out for Labor by the powers that be, while the majority of the  labor leaders waste the time paid for by their organizations in  listening to or discussing with capitalists sweet nothings in the form  of arbitration or reconciliation, and are apparently unaware of the  fundamental difference between the body they represent and the powers  they bow to. And thus it happens that labor organizations are being  brutally attacked, that the militia and soldiers are maiming their  brothers in the various strike regions while the leaders are being dined  and wined. The American Federation of Labor is lobbying in Washington,  begging for legal protection, and in return venal Justice sends  Winchester rifles and drunken militiamen into the disturbed labor  districts. Recently the American Federation of Labor made an alleged  radical step in deciding to put up labor candidates for Congress--an old  and threadbare political move--thereby sacrificing whatever honest men  and clear heads they may have in their ranks. Such tactics are not worth  a single drop of sweat of the workingmen, since they are not only  contradictory to the basic principles of trade unionism, but even  useless and impractical.    Pity for and indignation against the workers fill one's soul at the  spectacle of the ridiculous strike methods so often employed and that as  often frustrate the possible success of every large labor war. Or is it  not laughable, if it were not so deadly serious, that the producers  publicly discuss for months in advance where and when they might strike,  and therewith give the enemy a chance to prepare his means of combat.  For months the papers of the money power bring long interviews with  labor leaders, giving detailed descriptions of the ways and means of the  proposed strikes, or the results of negotiations with this or that mine  magnate. The more often these negotiations are reported, the more glory  to the so-called leaders, for the more often their names appear in the  papers; the more \"reasonable\" the utterances of these gentlemen (which  means that they are neither fish nor flesh, neither warm nor cold), the  surer they grow of the sympathy of the most reactionary element in the  country or of an invitation to the White House to join the Chief  Magistrate at dinner. Labor leaders of such caliber fail to consider  that every strike is a labor event upon the success or failure of which  thousands of lives depend; rather do they see in it an opportunity to  push their own insignificant personalities into prominence. Instead of  leading their organized hosts to victory, they disclose their  superficiality in their zeal not to injure their reputation for  \"respectability.\"    The workingmen? Be it victory or defeat, they must take up the reins of  every strike themselves; as it is, they play the dupes of the shrewd  attorneys on both sides, unaware of the price the trickery and cunning  of these men cost them.    As I said before, the unions negotiate strikes for days and weeks and  months beforehand, even allowing their men to work overtime in order to  produce all the commodities to continue business while the strike is  going on.    The printers, for instance, worked late into the night on magazines that  were being got ready four months in advance, and the miners who  discussed the strike so long until every remnant of enthusiasm was gone.    What wonder, then, that strikes fail? As long as the employer is in a  position to say, \"Strike if you will; I do not need you; I can fill my  orders; I know that hunger will drive _you_ back into the mine and  factory, _I_ can wait,\" there is no hope for the success of the strike.    Such have been the results of the legal trade union methods.    The history of the labor struggle of this country shows an incident that  warrants the hope for an energetic, revolutionary trade union agitation.  That is the eight-hour movement of 1886 which culminated in the death of  five labor leaders. That movement contained the true element of the  proletarian and revolutionary spirit, the lack of which makes organized  labor of to-day a ball in the hands of selfish aspirants, know-nothings  and politicians.    That which specifically characterized the event of 1886 as a  revolutionary factor was the fact that the eight-hour workday could  never be accomplished through lobbying with politicians, but through the  direct and economic weapon, the general strike.    The desire to demonstrate the efficacy of this weapon gave birth to the  idea of celebrating the first of May as an appropriate day for Labor's  festival. On that day the workingmen were to give the first practical  demonstration of the power of the general strike as an at least one-day  protest against oppression and tyranny, and which day were gradually to  become the means for the final overthrow of economic and social  dependence.    One may suggest that the tragedy of the 11th of November of 1887 has  stamped the general strike as a futile method, but this is not true. The  battle of liberation cannot be put a stop to by the brutality and  rascality of the ruling powers. The vicious anger and the wild hatred  that strangled our brothers in Chicago are the safest guarantee that  their activity struck a potentially fatal blow to government and  capital.    Neither Mr. Mitchell nor Mr. Gompers run the risk of dying upon the  gallows of sacred capitalistic Justitia; her ladyship is not at all as  blind as some suppose her to be; on the contrary, she has a very keen  eye for all that may prove beneficial or dangerous to the society that  draws its subsistence from the lives' blood of its people. She has quite  made up her mind that the gentlemen in the ranks of Labor to-day lead  the people about in a circle and never will urge them out into the open,  towards liberation.

The cruelties which especially characterized primitive man is  exercised as much to-day as in the days of cannibalism.    Civilization has been the refining agent of our qualities. Just as a  number of chemicals put into a crucible are refined by a certain acid,  while yet the original substances remain, though in different forms, so  has civilization refined and remolded the crude elements of our nature,  leaving the essence of our primitive qualities the same.    The subtlety with which cruelty is exercised to-day makes of it a  far-reaching and far more destructive force than formerly. Instead of  attacking our neighbors with sticks and stones and tomahawks, and  forcing them into captivity in order that they may work for us, we  obtain the same or even better results by numerous subtle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1," change in the  population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths  and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate  may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining  how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs  of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,  roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid  population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and terminals:  This entry lists major ports and terminals  primarily on the basis of the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through  the facilities on an annual basis. In some instances, the number of  containers handled or ship visits were also considered.    Public debt:  This entry records the cumulatiive total of all  government borrowings less repayments that are denominated in a  country's home currency. Public debt should not be confused with  external debt, which reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both  the private and public sector and must be financed out of foreign  exchange earnings.    Radio broadcast stations:  This entry includes the total number of AM,  FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.    Railways:  This entry states the total route length of the railway  network and of its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow,  and dual. Other gauges are listed under note.    Reference maps:  This section includes world and regional maps.    Refugees and internally displaced persons:  This entry includes those  persons residing in a country as refugees or internally displaced  persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee according to a United  Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside his/her country of  nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of  persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership  in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or  unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country,  or to return there, for fear of persecution.\" The UN established the  Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to  handle refugee matters worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for  Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a different,  operational definition for a Palestinian refugee: \"a person whose  normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946  to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a  result of the 1948 conflict.\" However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000  Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA definition. The term  \"internally displaced person\" is not specifically covered in the UN  Convention; it is used to describe people who have fled their homes for  reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within their own national  territory and are subject to the laws of that state.    Religions:  This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents  starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of  total population.    Reserves of foreign exchange and gold:  This entry gives the dollar  value for the stock of all financial assets that are available to the  central monetary authority for use in meeting a country's balance of  payments needs as of the end-date of the period specified. This  category includes not only foreign currency and gold, but also a  country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the International  Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.    Roadways:  This entry gives the total length of the road network and  includes the length of the paved and unpaved portions.    Sex ratio:  This entry includes the number of males for each female in  five age groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and  over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently  emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some  countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian  countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide  due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage  patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest  among young adult males who are unable to find partners.    Suffrage:  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the  right to vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers:  All telephone numbers in The World Factbook consist  of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)  in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not  presented is the international access code, which varies from country  to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call  placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows: 011 [34] (1)  577-xxxx, where 011 is the international access code for station-to-  station calls; 01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,  [34] is the country code for Spain, (1) is the city code for Madrid,  577 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number. An  international direct dial telephone call placed from another country to  the US would be as follows: international access code + [1] (202) 939-  xxxx, where [ 1] is the country code for the US, (202) is the area code  for Washington, DC, 939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local  telephone number.
