William Dampier,[26] in 1687, observed the habits of a fox-bat on one of  the Philippine Islands, though he has exaggerated its size when he  judged \"that the wings stretched out in length, could not be less  asunder than seven or eight foot from tip to tip.\" He records that \"in  the evening, as soon as the sun was set, these creatures would begin to  take their flight from this island in swarms like bees, directing their  flight over to the main island. Thus we should see them rising up from  the island till night hindered our sight; and in the morning, as soon as  it was light, we should see them returning again like a cloud to the  small island till sunrising. This course they kept constantly while we  lay here, affording us every morning and evening an hour's diversion in  gazing at them and talking about them.\" Dr Horsfield describes the  species, which is abundant in the lower parts of Java, as having the  same habit. During the day it retreats to the branches of a tree of the  genus _Ficus_, where it passes the greater portion of the day in sleep,  \"hanging motionless, ranged in succession, and often in close contact,  they have little resemblance to living beings, and by a person not  accustomed to their economy, are readily mistaken for a part of the  tree, or for a fruit of uncommon size suspended from its branches.\" The  doctor describes their society as being generally silent during the day,  except when a contention arises among them to get out of the influence  of the sun, when they utter a sharp piercing shriek. Their claws are so  sharp, and their attachment is consequently so strong, that they cannot  readily leave their hold without the assistance of their wings, and if  shot when in this position, they remain suspended.      DR MAYERNE AND HIS BALSAM OF BATS.    Dr Mayerne, a learned English physician, who died, aged eighty-two, in  1655, showed by his prescriptions that his enlightenment was not more  than that of the prevailing ignorance of the period. The chief  ingredient in his gout-powder was \"raspings of a human skull unburied;\"  \"but,\" writes Mr Jeaffreson,[27] \"his sweetest compound was his 'balsam  of bats,' strongly recommended as an unguent for hypochondriacal  persons, into which entered adders, bats, sucking whelps, earth-worms,  hogs' grease, the marrow of a stag, and the thigh-bone of an ox.\"    No doubt the doctor imagined that a combination of the virulence,  flightiness, swiftness, strength, and other qualities of all these  animals would in some mysterious way be communicated to his melancholy  patient; and, indeed, by acting on the imagination of such persons a  favourable direction is given to their thoughts, and in this way their  severe malady may at times have been removed.    FOOTNOTES:    [23] Illustrated Proceedings of Zoological Society.    [24] This was written some years ago; but I was glad to see when last in  the Zoological Gardens, June 1866, another live specimen of a species of  fox bat.

This well-armed genus of insect-eating quadruped has sometimes given to  describing zoologists, at least so it is said, an opportunity of paying  a sly compliment, concealing an allusion to the _touchy_ or supposed  irritable disposition of the party after whom the species has been  named. When Southey wrote the following paragraph, he happily expressed  what is too commonly the meaning and wish of critics and criticised. If  my readers look into any system of mammalia of recent date, under the  article _Erinaceus_, he will see one or more instances of concealed  allusions to touchiness of disposition in the persons of the  naturalists, _honoured_ by the seeming compliment. The hedgehog is  itself a very useful and very harmless quadruped. It is of great use in  a garden, and also in a kitchen frequented by crickets or black-beetles.  Its food is chiefly grubs, insects, worms, and such like. The creature  is easily tamed, and becomes a lovable and not a touchy pet. It is  eminently nocturnal.      SOUTHEY AND HIS CRITICS.    Robert Southey (\"Common-Place Book,\" 4th series, p.44) writes:--    \"I intend to be a hedgehog, and roll myself up in my own prickles: all I  regret is that I am not a porcupine, and endowed with the property of  shooting them to annoy the beasts who come near enough to annoy me.\"          MOLE.      This is perhaps the most remarkable of all our quadrupeds. Its  subterranean haunts and curious aptitudes for a life below the surface  of the ground are peculiarly worthy of study. The little hillocks it  turns up in its excavations are noticed by every one. Its pursuit of  worms and grubs, its nest, its soft plush-like fur, the pointed nose,  the strong digging fore-feet, the small all but hidden eyes, and  hundreds of other properties, render it a noticeable creature. The  following passage from Lord Macaulay's latest writings, although rather  long, may interest some in the story of this curious creature:--      THE MOLE AND KING WILLIAM.    \"A fly, if it had God's message, could choke a king.\"[28] I never knew  till the 9th January 1862, when reading vol. v. of Macaulay's England,  that a horse, stumbling on a mole-hill, was the immediate cause of the  death of the great William III.    Lady Trevelyan, the sister of Macaulay, published vol. v. of her  brother's work, and added an account of the death of the illustrious  Dutchman, who did so much for our religious and civil liberties. The  historian was very partial to William, and the account of that monarch's  last days is Macaulay's last finished piece: it is here quoted in full  from the history:[29]--    \"Meanwhile reports about the state of the king's health were constantly  becoming more and more alarming. His medical advisers, both English and  Dutch, were at the end of their resources. He had consulted by letter  all the most eminent physicians of Europe; and, as he was apprehensive  that they might return flattering answers if they knew who he was, he  had written under feigned names. To Fagon he had described himself as a  parish priest. Fagon replied, somewhat bluntly, that such symptoms could  have only one meaning, and that the only advice which he had to give to  the sick man was to prepare himself for death. Having obtained this  plain answer, William consulted Fagon again without disguise, and  obtained some prescriptions which were thought to have a little retarded  the approach of the inevitable hour. But the great king's days were  numbered. Headaches and shivering fits returned on him almost daily. He  still rode, and even hunted; but he had no longer that firm seat, or  that perfect command of the bridle, for which he had once been renowned.  Still all his care was for the future. The filial respect and tenderness  of Albemarle had been almost a necessary of life to him. But it was of  importance that Heinsius should be fully informed both as to the whole  plan of the next campaign, and as to the state of the preparations.  Albemarle was in full possession of the king's views on these subjects.  He was therefore sent to the Hague. Heinsius was at that time suffering  from indisposition, which was indeed a trifle when compared with the  maladies under which William was sinking. But in the nature of William  there was none of that selfishness which is the too common vice of  invalids. On the 20th of February he sent to Heinsius a letter, in which  he did not even allude to his own sufferings and infirmities. 'I am,'  he said, 'infinitely concerned to learn that your health is not yet  quite re-established. May God be pleased to grant you a speedy recovery.  I am unalterably your good friend, WILLIAM.' These were the last lines  of that long correspondence.    \"On the 20th of February, William was ambling on a favourite horse named  Sorrel through the park of Hampton Court. He urged his horse to strike  into a gallop just at the spot where a mole had been at work. Sorrel  stumbled on the mole-hill, and went down on his knees. The king fell  off, and broke his collar-bone. The bone was set, and he returned to  Kensington in his coach. The jolting of the rough roads of that time  made it necessary to reduce the fracture again. To a young and vigorous  man such an accident would have been a trifle; but the frame of William  was not in a condition to bear even the slightest shock. He felt that  his time was short, and grieved, with a grief such as only noble spirits  feel, to think that he must leave his work but half finished. It was  possible that he might still live until one of his plans should be  carried into execution. He had long known that the relation in which  England and Scotland stood to each other was at best precarious, and  often unfriendly, and that it might be doubted whether, in an estimate  of the British power, the resources of the smaller country ought not to  be deducted from those of the larger. Recent events had proved that  without doubt the two kingdoms could not possibly continue for another  year to be on the terms on which they had been during the preceding  century, and that there must be between them either absolute union or  deadly enmity. Their enmity would bring frightful calamities, not on  themselves alone, but on all the civilised world. Their union would be  the best security for the prosperity of both, for the internal  tranquillity of the island, for the just balance of power among European  states, and for the immunities of all Protestant countries. On the 28th  of February, the Commons listened, with uncovered heads, to the last  message that bore William's sign-manual. An unhappy accident, he told  them, had forced him to make to them in writing a communication which he  would gladly have made from the throne."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#11)"],[1,"_neglecta_ (the western)  is paler and grayer than that of _magna_, the black markings being less  conspicuous, and those on the tertials and middle tail-feathers being  arranged in narrow, isolated bars, and not connected along the shaft.  While the flanks and under tail-coverts of _magna_ are distinctly washed  with buff, those of _neglecta_ are white, very faintly tinged with buff,  if at all. The yellow of the throat of the eastern form does not spread  out laterally over the malar region, as does that of the western lark.  All of which tends to prove that the two forms are distinct.    Early in the spring of 1901 the writer took a trip to Oklahoma in the  interest of bird-study, and found both kinds of meadow-larks extremely  abundant and lavish of their melodies on the fertile prairies. He  decided to carry on a little original investigation in the field of  inquiry now under discussion. One day, in a draw of the prairie, he  noticed a western meadow-lark which was unusually lyrical, having the  skill of a past-master in the art of trilling and gurgling and fluting.  Again and again I went to the place, on the same day and on different  days, and invariably found the westerner there, perching on the fence or  a weed-stem, and greeting me with his exultant lays. But, mark: no  eastern lark ever intruded on his preserve. In other and more distant  parts of the broad field the easterners were blowing their piccolos, but  they did not encroach on the domain of the lyrical westerner, who, with  his mate--now on her nest in the grass--had evidently jumped his claim  and held it with a high hand. In many other places in Oklahoma and  Kansas where both species dwell, I have noticed the same interesting  fact--that in the breeding season each form selects a special precinct,  into which the other form does not intrude. They perhaps put up some  kind of trespass sign. These observations have all but convinced me that  _S. magna_ and _S. neglecta_ are distinct species, and avoid getting  mixed up in their family affairs.    Nor is that all. While both forms dwell on the vast prairies of  Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, yet, as you travel eastward, the western  larks gradually diminish in number until at length they entirely  disappear; whereas, if you journey westward, the precise opposite  occurs. I have never heard _neglecta_ east of the Missouri River,[4] nor  _magna_ on the plains of Colorado. Therefore the conclusion is almost  forced upon the observer that there are structural and organic  differences between the two forms.        [4] He sometimes ventures, though sparingly, as far east as Illinois      and Wisconsin; still my statement is true--I have never heard the      western lark even in the bottoms and meadows of the broad valley      east of the Missouri River, while, one spring morning, I did hear      one of these birds fluting in the top of a cottonwood tree in my      yard on the high western bluff of that stream.    After the foregoing deductions had been reached, the writer bethought  him of consulting Ridgway's Manual on the subject, and was gratified to  find his views corroborated by a footnote answering to an asterisk  affixed to the name of the western lark:        \"Without much doubt a distinct species. The occurrence of both _S.      neglecta_ and _S. magna_ together in many portions of the      Mississippi Valley, each in its typical style (the ranges of the two      overlapping, in fact, for a distance of several hundred miles),      taken together with the excessive rarity of intermediate specimens      and the universally attested radical difference in their notes, are      facts wholly incompatible with the theory of their being merely      geographical races of the same species.\"    This has been a long _excursus_, and we must get back to our jaunt on  the plain. While I was engaged in watching the birds already named, my  ear was greeted by a loud, clear, bell-like call; and, on looking in the  direction from which it came, I observed a bird hovering over a ploughed  field not far away, and then descending with graceful, poising flight to  the ground. It proved to be the Arkansas flycatcher, a large, elegant  bird that is restricted to the West. I had never seen this species.  Nothing like him is known in the East, the crested flycatcher being most  nearly a copy of him, although the manners of the two birds are quite  unlike. The body of the western bird is as large as that of the robin,  and he must be considerably longer from tip of beak to tip of tail. He  is a fine-looking fellow, presenting a handsome picture as he stands on  a weed-stalk or a fence-post, his yellow jacket gleaming in the sun. He  is the possessor of a clear, musical voice, and if he had the vocal  organs of some of the oscines, he certainly would be one of the best  feathered lyrists of America. Unfortunately he is able to do nothing but  chirp and chatter, although he puts not a little music into his simple  vocal exercises.    It was surprising to note on how slender a weed-stalk so large a bird  was able to perch. There being few trees and fences in this region, he  has doubtless gained expertness through practice in the art of securing  a foot-hold on the tops of the weed-stems. Some of the weeds on which he  stood with perfect ease and grace were extremely lithe and flexible and  almost devoid of branches.    But what was the cause of this particular bird's intense solicitude? It  was obvious there was a nest in the neighborhood. As I sought in the  grass and weed-clumps, he uttered his piercing calls of protest and  circled and hovered overhead like a red-winged blackbird. Suddenly the  thought occurred to me that the flycatchers of my acquaintance do not  nest on the ground, but on trees. I looked around, and, sure enough, in  the shallow hollow below me stood a solitary willow tree not more than  fifteen or twenty feet high, the only tree to be seen within a mile. And  that lone tree on the plain was occupied by the flycatcher and his mate  for a nesting place. In a crotch the gray cottage was set, containing  three callow babies and one beautifully mottled egg.    In another fork of the same small tree a pair of kingbirds--the same  species as our well-known eastern bee-martins--had built their nest, in  the downy cup of which lay four eggs similarly decorated with brown  spots. The birds now all circled overhead and joined in an earnest plea  with me not to destroy their homes and little ones, and I hurriedly  climbed down from the tree to relieve their agitation, stopping only a  moment to examine the twine plaited into the felted nests of the  kingbirds. The willow sapling contained also the nest of a turtle dove.    \"If there are three nests in this small tree, there may be a large  number in the cluster of trees beyond the swell about a mile away,\" I  mused, and forthwith made haste to go to the place indicated. I was not  disappointed. Had the effort been made, I am sure two score of nests  might have been found in these trees, for they were liberally decorated  with bird cots and hammocks. Most of these were kingbirds' and Arkansas  flycatchers' nests, but there were others as well. On one small limb  there were four of the dangling nests of Bullock's orioles, one of them  fresh, the rest more or less weather beaten, proving that this bird had  been rearing broods here for a number of seasons.    Whose song was this ringing from one of the larger trees a little  farther down the glade? I could scarcely believe the testimony of my  ears and eyes, yet there could be no mistake--it was the vivacious  mimicry of the mocking-bird, which had travelled far across the plain to  this solitary clump of trees to find singing perches and a site for his  nests. He piped his musical miscellany with as much good-cheer as if he  were dwelling in the neighborhood of some embowered cottage in  Dixie-land. In suitable localities on the plains of Colorado the mockers  were found to be quite plentiful, but none were seen among the  mountains.    A network of twigs and vines in one of the small willows afforded a  support and partial covert for the nest of a pair of white-rumped  shrikes. It contained six thickly speckled eggs, and was the first nest  of this species I had ever found. The same hollow,--if so shallow a dip  in the plain can be called a hollow,--was selected as the home of  several pairs of red-winged and Brewer's blackbirds, which built their  grassy cots in the low bushes of a slightly boggy spot, where a feeble  spring oozed from the ground. It was a special pleasure to find a  green-tailed towhee in the copse of the draw, for I had supposed that he  always hugged close to the steep mountain sides.    A walk before breakfast the next morning added several more avian  species to my roll. To my surprise, a pair of mountain bluebirds had  chosen the village for their summer residence, and were building a nest  in the coupler of a freight car standing on a side track. The domicile  was almost completed, and I could not help feeling sorry for the pretty,  innocent couple, at the thought that the car would soon be rolling  hundreds of miles away, and all their loving toil would go for naught.  Bluebirds had previously been seen at the timber-line among the  mountains, and here was a pair forty miles out on the plain--quite a  range for this species, both longitudinally and vertically.    During the forenoon the following birds were observed: A family of  juvenile Arkansas flycatchers, which were being fed by their parents; a  half-dozen or more western grassfinches, trilling the same pensive tunes  as their eastern half-brothers; a small, long-tailed sparrow, which I  could not identify at the time, but which I now feel certain was  Lincoln's sparrow; these, with a large marsh-harrier and a colony of  cliff-swallows, completed my bird catalogue at this place. It may not be  amiss to add that"]]]
