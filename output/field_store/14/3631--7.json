There, on the porch, which it had mounted by way  of the steps, tearing away part of the railing, was a large touring  car; and, sitting at the steering wheel, in a dazed sort of manner, was  Mr. Wakefield Damon.    \"Bless my shirt studs!\" he went on feebly. \"But I have done it now!\"    \"What's the matter?\" cried Tom, hastening up to him. \"What happened?  Are you hurt?\"    \"Hurt? Not a bit of it! Bless my moonstone!  It's the most lucky escape  I ever had! But I've damaged your porch, and I haven't done my machine  any good. Do you see anything of another machine chasing me?\"    Tom looked puzzled, but glanced up and down the road. Far down the  highway could be discerned a cloud of dust, and, from the midst of it  came a faint \"chug-chug.\"    \"Looks like an auto down there,\" he said.    \"Thank goodness! Bless my trousers, but I've escaped 'em!\" cried the  eccentric man from whom Tom had purchased his motor-cycle.    \"Escaped who?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"Those men. They were after me. But I may as well get out and explain.  Dear me! However will I ever get my car off your porch?\" and Mr. Damon  seemed quite distressed.    \"Never mind,\" answered Tom. \"We can manage that. Tell us what happened.\"    \"Exactly,\" replied Mr. Damon, growing calmer, \"Bless my shoe buttons,  but I had a fright, two of them, in fact.    \"You see,\" he went on, \"I was out partly on pleasure and partly on  business. The pleasure consisted in riding in my auto, which my  physician recommended for my health. The business consisted in bringing  to the Shopton Bank a large amount of cash. Well, I deposited it all  right, but, as I came out I saw some men hanging around. I didn't like  their looks, and I saw them eyeing me rather sharply. I thought I had  seen them before and, sure enough I had. Two of the men belonged to  that Happy Harry gang!\"    Tom made a quick motion of a caution, pointing to his father, but it  was not necessary, as Mr. Swift was absently-mindedly calculating on a  piece of paper he had taken from his pocket, and had not heard what Mr.  Damon said. The latter, however, knew what Tom meant, and went on.    \"Well, I didn't like the looks of these men, and when I saw them sizing  me up, evidently thinking I had drawn money out instead of putting it  in, I decided to give them the slip. I got in my auto, but I was  startled to see them get in their car. I headed for here, as I was  coming to pay you a visit, anyhow, and the mysterious men kept after  me. It became a regular race. I put on all the speed I could and headed  for your house, Tom, for I thought you would help me. I went faster and  faster, and so did they. They were almost up to me, and I was just  thinking of slowing down to turn in here, when I lost control of my  machine, and--well, I did turn in here, but not exactly as I intended.  Bless my gaiters! I came in with rather more of a rush than I expected.  It was awful--positively awful, I assure you. You've no idea how  nervous I was. But I escaped those scoundrels, for they rushed on when  they saw what I had done--smashed the porch railing.\"    \"Probably they thought you'd smash them,\" observed Tom with a laugh.  \"But why did they follow you?\"    \"Can't imagine! Haven't the least idea. Bless my spark-plug, but they  might have imagined I had money. Anyhow I'm glad I escaped them!\"    \"It's lucky you weren't hurt,\" said Mr. Sharp.    \"Oh, me? Bless my existence! I'm always having narrow escapes.\" Mr.  Damon caught sight of the Red Cloud which was out in front of the big  shed. \"Bless my heart! What's that?\" he added.    \"Our new airship,\" answered Tom proudly. \"We are just planning a long  trip in it, but we can't find a third member of the party to go along.\"    \"A third member!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Do you really mean it?\"    \"We do.\"    \"Bless my shoe laces! Will you take me along?\"    \"Do you mean that?\" asked Tom in turn, foreseeing a way out of their  difficulties.    \"I certainly do,\" answered the eccentric man. \"I am much interested in  airships, and I might as well die up in the clouds as any other way.  Certainly I prefer it to being smashed up in an auto. Will you take me?\"    \"Of course!\" cried Tom heartily, and Mr. Sharp nodded an assent. Then  Tom drew Mr. Damon to one side. \"We'll arrange the trip in a few  minutes,\" the lad said. \"Tell me more about those mysterious men,  please.\"          Chapter 10    A Bag of Tools      Wakefield Damon glanced at Mr. Swift. The inventor was oblivious to his  surroundings, and was busy figuring away on some paper. He seemed even  to have forgotten the presence of the eccentric autoist.    \"I don't want father to hear about the men,\" went on Tom, in a low  tone. \"If he hears that Happy Harry and his confederates are in this  vicinity, he'll worry, and that doesn't agree with him. But are you  sure the men you saw are the same ones who stole the turbine model?\"    \"Very certain,\" replied Mr. Damon. \"I had a good view of them as I came  from the bank, and I was surprised to see them, until I remembered that  they were out of jail.\"    \"But why do you think they pursued you?\"    \"Bless my eyes! I can't say. Perhaps they weren't after me at all. I  may have imagined it, but they certainly hurried off in their auto as  soon as I left the bank, after leaving my money there. I'm glad I  deposited it before I saw them. I was so nervous, as it was, that I  couldn't steer straight. It's too bad, the way I've damaged your house.\"    \"That doesn't matter. But how about the trip in the airship? I hope you  meant it when you said you would go.\"    \"Of course I did. I've never traveled in the air, but it can't be much  worse than my experience with my motor-cycle and the auto. At least I  can't run up any stoop, can I?\" and Mr. Damon looked at Mr. Sharp.    \"No,\" replied the aeronaut, as he scratched his head, \"I guess you'll  be safe on that score. But I hope you won't get nervous when we reach a  great height.\"    \"Oh, no. I'll just calm myself with the reflection that I can't die but  once,\" and with this philosophical reflection Mr. Damon went back to  look at the auto, which certainly looked odd, stuck up on the veranda.    \"Well, you'd better make arrangements to go with us then,\" went on Tom.  \"Meanwhile I'll see to getting your car down. You'll want to send it  home, I suppose?\"    \"No, not if you'll keep it for me. The fact is that all my folks are  away, and will be for some time. I don't have to go home to notify  them, and it's a good thing, as my wife is very nervous, and might  object, if she heard about the airship. I'll just stay here, if you've  no objection, until the Red Cloud sails, if sails is the proper term.\"    \"'Sails' will do very well,\" answered Mr. Sharp. \"But, Tom, let's see  if you and I can't get that car down. Perhaps Mr. Damon would like to  go in the house and talk to your father,\" for Mr. Swift had left the  piazza.    The eccentric individual was glad enough not to be on hand when his car  was eased down from the veranda and disappeared into the house.  Tom  and Mr. Sharp, with the aid of Garret Jackson, then released the auto  from its position. They had to take down the rest of the broken  railing, and their task was easy enough. The machine was stored in a  disused shed, and Mr. Damon had no further concern until it was time to  undertake the trip through the air.    \"It will fool those men if I mysteriously disappear,\" he said, with a  smile. \"Bless my hat band, but they'll wonder what became of me. We'll  just slip off in the Red Cloud, and they'll never be the wiser.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" commented Tom. \"I fancy they are keeping  pretty close watch in this vicinity, and I don't like it. I'm afraid  they are up to some mischief. I should think the bank authorities would  have them locked upon suspicion. I think I'll telephone Ned about it.\"    He did so, and his chum, in turn, notified the bank watchman. But the  next day it was reported that no sign of the men had been seen, and,  later it was learned that an auto, answering the description of the one  they were in, had been seen going south, many miles from Shopton.    The work of preparing the Red Cloud for the long trip was all but  completed. It had been placed back in the shed while a few more  adjustments were made to the machinery.    \"Bless my eyelashes!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, a few days before the one  set for the start, \"but I haven't asked where we are bound for. Where  are we going, anyhow, Mr. Sharp?\"    \"We're going to try and reach Atlanta, Georgia,\" replied the  balloonist. \"That will make a fairly long trip, and the winds at this  season are favorable in that direction.\"    \"That suits me all right,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"I'm all ready and  anxious to start.\"    It was decided to give the airship a few more trials around Shopton  before setting out, to see how it behaved with the car heavier loaded  than usual. With this in view a trip was made to Rocksmond, with Mr.  Swift, Mr. Damon and Ned, in addition to Mr. Sharp and Tom, on board.  Then, at Tom's somewhat blushing request, a stop was made near the  Seminary, and, when the pupils came trooping out, the young inventor  asked Miss Nestor if she didn't want to take a little flight. She  consented, and with two pretty companions climbed rather hesitatingly  into the car. No great height was attained, but the girls were fully  satisfied and, after their first alarm really enjoyed the spin in the  air, with Tom proudly presiding at the steering wheel, which Mr. Sharp  relinquished to the lad, for he understood Tom's feelings.    Three days later all was in readiness for the trip to Atlanta. Mr.  Swift was earnestly invited to undertake it, both Tom and Mr. Sharp  urging him, but the veteran inventor said he must stay at home, and  work on his submarine plans.
