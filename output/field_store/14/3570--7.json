Scottish ceremonial prescribes for the widows of kings retirement for  forty days in a room entirely closed to the light of day: on the twelfth  day Mary had the windows opened, and on the fifteenth set out with  Bothwell for Seaton, a country house situated five miles from the  capital, where the French ambassador, Ducroc, went in search of her, and  made her remonstrances which decided her to return to Edinburgh; but  instead of the cheers which usually greeted her coming, she was received  by an icy silence, and a solitary woman in the crowd called out, \"God  treat her as she deserves!\"    The names of the murderers were no secret to the people. Bothwell having  brought a splendid coat which was too large for him to a tailor, asking  him to remake it to his measure, the man recognised it as having  belonged to the king. \"That's right,\" said he; \"it is the custom for the  executioner to inherit from the condemned\". Meanwhile, the Earl of  Lennox, supported by the people's murmurs, loudly demanded justice for  his son's death, and came forward as the accuser of his murderers. The  queen was then obliged, to appease paternal clamour and public  resentment, to command the Earl of Argyll, the Lord Chief Justice of the  kingdom, to make investigations; the same day that this order was given,  a proclamation was posted up in the streets of Edinburgh, in which the  queen promised two thousand pounds sterling to whoever would make known  the king's murderers. Next day, wherever this letter had been affixed,  another placard was found, worded thus:    \"As it has been proclaimed that those who should make known the king's  murderers should have two thousand pounds sterling, I, who have made a  strict search, affirm that the authors of the murder are the Earl of  Bothwell, James Balfour, the priest of Flisk, David, Chambers,  Blackmester, Jean Spens, and the queen herself.\"    This placard was torn down; but, as usually happens, it had already been  read by the entire population.    The Earl of Lennox accused Bothwell, and public opinion, which also  accused him, seconded the earl with such violence, that Mary was  compelled to bring him to trial: only every precaution was taken to  deprive the prosecutor of the power of convicting the accused. On the  28th March, the Earl of Lennox received notice that the 12th April was  fixed for the trial: he was granted a fortnight to collect decisive  proofs against the most powerful man in all Scotland; but the Earl of  Lennox, judging that this trial was a mere mockery, did not appear.  Bothwell, on the contrary, presented himself at the court, accompanied  by five thousand partisans and two hundred picked fusiliers, who guarded  the doors directly he had entered; so that he seemed to be rather a king  who is about to violate the law than an accused who comes to submit to  it. Of course there happened what was certain to happen--that is to say,  the jury acquitted Bothwell of the crime of which everyone, the judges  included, knew him to be guilty.    The day of the trial, Bothwell had this written challenge placarded:    \"Although I am sufficiently cleared of the murder of the king, of which  I have been falsely accused, yet, the better to prove my innocence, I  am, ready to engage in combat with whomsoever will dare to maintain that  I have killed the king.\"    The day after, this reply appeared:    \"I accept the challenge, provided that you select neutral ground.\"    However, judgment had been barely given, when rumours of a marriage  between the queen and the Earl of Bothwell were abroad. However strange  and however mad this marriage, the relations of the two lovers were so  well known that no one doubted but that it was true. But as everyone  submitted to Bothwell, either through fear or through ambition, two men  only dared to protest beforehand against this union: the one was Lord  Herries, and the other James Melville.    Mary was at Stirling when Lord Herries, taking advantage of Bothwell's  momentary absence, threw himself at her feet, imploring her not to lose  her honour by marrying her husband's murderer, which could not fail to  convince those who still doubted it that she was his accomplice. But the  queen, instead of thanking Herries for this devotion, seemed very much  surprised at his boldness, and scornfully signing to him to rise, she  coldly replied that her heart was silent as regarded the Earl of  Bothwell, and that, if she should ever re-marry, which was not probable,  she would neither forget what she owed to her people nor what she owed  to herself.    Melville did not allow himself to be discouraged by this experience, and  pretended, to have received a letter that one of his friends, Thomas  Bishop, had written him from England. He showed this letter to the  queen; but at the first lines Mary recognised the style, and above all  the friendship of her ambassador, and giving the letter to the Earl of  Livingston, who was present, \"There is a very singular letter,\" said  she. \"Read it. It is quite in Melvine's manner.\"    Livingston glanced through the letter, but had scarcely read the half of  it when he took Melville by the hand, and drawing him into the embrasure  of a window,    \"My dear Melville,\" said he, \"you were certainly mad when you just now  imparted this letter to the queen: as soon as the Earl of Bothwell gets  wind of it, and that will not be long, he will have you assassinated.  You have behaved like an honest man, it is true; but at court it is  better to behave as a clever man. Go away, then, as quickly as possible;  it is I who recommend it.\"    Melville did not require to be told twice, and stayed away for a week.  Livingston was not mistaken: scarcely had Bothwell returned to the queen  than he knew all that had passed. He burst out into curses against  Melville, and sought for him everywhere; but he could not find him.    This beginning of opposition, weak as it was, none the less disquieted  Bothwell, who, sure of Mary's love, resolved to make short work of  things. Accordingly, as the queen was returning from Stirling to  Edinburgh some days after the scenes we have just related, Bothwell  suddenly appeared at the Bridge of Grammont with a thousand horsemen,  and, having disarmed the Earl of Huntly, Livingston, and Melville, who  had returned to his mistress, he seized the queen's horse by the bridle,  and with apparent violence he forced Mary to turn back and follow him to  Dunbar; which the queen did without any resistance--a strange thing for  one of Mary's character.    The day following, the Earls of Huntly, Livingston, Melville, and the  people in their train were set at liberty; then, ten days afterwards,  Bothwell and the queen, perfectly reconciled, returned to Edinburgh  together.    Two days after this return, Bothwell gave a great dinner to the nobles  his partisans in a tavern. When the meal was ended, on the very same  table, amid half-drained glasses and empty bottles, Lindsay, Ruthven,  Morton, Maitland, and a dozen or fifteen other noblemen signed a bond  which not only set forth that upon their souls and consciences Bothwell  was innocent, but which further denoted him as the most suitable husband  for the queen. This bond concluded with this sufficiently strange  declaration:    \"After all, the queen cannot do otherwise, since the earl has carried  her off and has lain with her.\"    Yet two circumstances were still opposed to this marriage: the first,  that Bothwell had already been married three times, and that his three  wives were living; the second, that having carried off the queen, this  violence might cause to be regarded as null the alliance which she  should contract with him: the first of these objections was attended to,  to begin with, as the one most difficult to solve.    Bothwell's two first wives were of obscure birth, consequently he  scorned to disquiet himself about them; but it was not so with the  third, a daughter of that Earl of Huntly who been trampled beneath the  horses' feet, and a sister of Gordon, who had been decapitated.  Fortunately for Bothwell, his past behaviour made his wife long for a  divorce with an eagerness as great as his own. There was not much  difficulty, then, in persuading her to bring a charge of adultery  against her husband. Bothwell confessed that he had had criminal  intercourse with a relative of his wife, and the Archbishop of St.  Andrews, the same who had taken up his abode in that solitary house at  Kirk of Field to be present at Darnley's death, pronounced the marriage  null. The case was begun, pushed on, and decided in ten days.    As to the second obstacle, that of the violence used to the queen, Mary  undertook to remove it herself; for, being brought before the court, she  declared that not only did she pardon Bothwell for his conduct as  regarded her, but further that, knowing him to be a good and faithful  subject, she intended raising him immediately to new honours. In fact,  some days afterwards she created him Duke of Orkney, and on the 15th of  the same month--that is to say, scarcely four months after the death of  Darnley--with levity that resembled madness, Mary, who had petitioned  for a dispensation to wed a Catholic prince, her cousin in the third  degree, married Bothwell, a Protestant upstart, who, his divorce  notwithstanding, was still bigamous, and who thus found himself in the  position of having four wives living, including the queen.    The wedding was dismal, as became a festival under such outrageous  auspices. Morton, Maitland, and some base flatterers of Bothwell alone  were present at it. The French ambassador, although he was a creature of  the House of Guise, to which the queen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#11)"],[1,"known myself--that is  to say, in a serenity full of celestial desires and a courageous and  indefatigable love of liberty, such I am about to die.    \"May God be with you and with me!--Your son, brother, and friend,  \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\"    From that moment his serenity remained un troubled; during the whole day  he talked more gaily than usual, slept well, did not awake until  half-past seven, said that he felt stronger, and thanked God for  visiting him thus.    The nature of the verdict had been known since the day before, and it  had been learned that the execution was fixed for the 20th of May--that  is to say, three full days after the sentence had been read to the  accused.    Henceforward, with Sand's permission, persons who wished to speak to him  and whom he was not reluctant to see, were admitted: three among these  paid him long and noteworthy visits.    One was Major Holzungen, of the Baden army, who was in command of the  patrol that had arrested him, or rather picked him up, dying, and  carried him to the hospital. He asked him whether he recognised him, and  Sand's head was so clear when he stabbed himself, that although he saw  the major only for a moment and had never seen him again since, he  remembered the minutest details of the costume which he had been wearing  fourteen months previously, and which was the full-dress uniform. When  the talk fell upon the death to which Sand was to submit at so early an  age, the major pitied him; but Sand answered, with a smile, \"There is  only one difference between you and me, major; it is that I shall die  far my convictions, and you will die for someone else's convictions.\"    After the major came a young student from Jena whom Sand had known at  the university. He happened to be in the duchy of Baden and wished to  visit him. Their recognition was touching, and the student wept much;  but Sand consoled him with his usual calmness and serenity.    Then a workman asked to be admitted to see Sand, on the plea that he had  been his schoolfellow at Wonsiedel, and although he did not remember his  name, he ordered him to be let in: the workman reminded him that he had  been one of the little army that Sand had commanded on the day of the  assault of St. Catherine's tower. This indication guided Sand, who  recognised him perfectly, and then spoke with tender affection of his  native place and his dear mountains. He further charged him to greet his  family, and to beg his mother, father, brothers, and sisters once more  not to be grieved on his account, since the messenger who undertook to  deliver his last wards could testify in how calm and joyful a temper he  was awaiting death.    To this workman succeeded one of the guests whom Sand had met on the  staircase directly after Kotzebue's death. He asked him whether he  acknowledged his crime and whether he felt any repentance. Sand replied,  \"I had thought about it during a whole year. I have been thinking of it  for fourteen months, and my opinion has never varied in any respect: I  did what I should have done.\"    After the departure of this last visitor, Sand sent for Mr. G----, the  governor of the prison, and told him that he should like to talk to the  executioner before the execution, since he wished to ask for  instructions as to how he should hold himself so as to render the  operation most certain and easy. Mr. G----made some objections, but Sand  insisted with his usual gentleness, and Mr. G----at last promised that  the man in question should be asked to call at the prison as soon as he  arrived from Heidelberg, where he lived.    The rest of the day was spent in seeing more visitors and in  philosophical and moral talks, in which Sand developed his social and  religious theories with a lucidity of expression and an elevation of  thought such as he had, perhaps, never before shown. The governor of the  prison from whom I heard these details, told me that he should all his  life regret that he did not know shorthand, so that he might have noted  all these thoughts, which would have formed a pendant to the Phaedo.    Night came. Sand spent part of the evening writing; it is thought that  he was composing a poem; but no doubt he burned it, for no trace of it  was found. At eleven he went to bed, and slept until six in the morning.  Next day he bore the dressing of his wound, which was always very  painful, with extraordinary courage, without fainting, as he sometimes  did, and without suffering a single complaint to escape him: he had  spoken the truth; in the presence of death God gave him the grace of  allowing his strength to return. The operation was over; Sand was lying  down as usual, and Mr. G----was sitting on the foot of his bed, when the  door opened and a man came in and bowed to Sand and to Mr. G----. The  governor of the prison immediately stood up, and said to Sand in a voice  the emotion of which he could not conceal, \"The person who is bowing to  you is Mr. Widemann of Heidelberg, to whom you wished to speak.\"    Then Sand's face was lighted up by a strange joy; he sat up and said,  \"Sir, you are welcome.\" Then, making his visitor sit down by his bed,  and taking his hand, he began to thank him for being so obliging, and  spoke in so intense a tone and so gentle a voice, that Mr. Widemann,  deeply moved, could not answer. Sand encouraged him to speak and to give  him the details for which he wished, and in order to reassure him, said,  \"Be firm, sir; for I, on my part, will not fail you: I will not move;  and even if you should need two or three strokes to separate my head  from my body, as I am told is sometimes the case, do not be troubled on  that account.\"    Then Sand rose, leaning on Mr. G----, to go through with the executioner  the strange and terrible rehearsal of the drama in which he was to play  the leading part on the morrow. Mr. Widemann made him sit in a chair and  take the required position, and went into all the details of the  execution with him. Then Sand, perfectly instructed, begged him not to  hurry and to take his time. Then he thanked him beforehand; \"for,\" added  he, \"afterwards I shall not be able.\" Then Sand returned to his bed,  leaving the executioner paler and more trembling than himself. All these  details have been preserved by Mr. G----; for as to the executioner, his  emotion was so great that he could remember nothing.    After Mr. Widemann, three clergymen were introduced, with whom Sand  conversed upon religious matters: one of them stayed six hours with him,  and on leaving him told him that he was commissioned to obtain from him  a promise of not speaking to the people at the place of execution. Sand  gave the promise, and added, \"Even if I desired to do so, my voice has  become so weak that people could not hear it.\"    Meanwhile the scaffold was being erected in the meadow that extends on  the left of the road to Heidelberg. It was a platform five to six feet  high and ten feet wide each way. As it was expected that, thanks to the  interest inspired by the prisoner and to the nearness to Whitsuntide,  the crowd would be immense, and as some movement from the universities  was apprehended, the prison guards had been trebled, and General  Neustein had been ordered to Mannheim from Carlsruhe, with twelve  hundred infantry, three hundred and fifty cavalry, and a company of  artillery with guns.    On, the afternoon of the 19th there arrived, as had been foreseen, so  many students, who took up their abode in the neighbouring villages,  that it was decided to put forward the hour of the execution, and to let  it take place at five in the morning instead of at eleven, as had been  arranged. But Sand's consent was necessary for this; for he could not be  executed until three full days after the reading of his sentence, and as  the sentence had not been read to him till half-past ten Sand had a  right to live till eleven o'clock.    Before four in the morning the officials went into the condemned man's  room; he was sleeping so soundly that they were obliged to awaken him.  He opened his eyes with a smile, as was his custom, and guessing why  they came, asked, \"Can I have slept so well that it is already eleven in  the morning?\" They told him that it was not, but that they had come to  ask his permission to put forward the time; for, they told him, same  collision between the students and the soldiers was feared, and as the  military preparations were very thorough, such a collision could not be  otherwise than fatal to his friends. Sand answered that he was ready  that very moment, and only asked time enough to take a bath, as the  ancients were accustomed to do before going into battle. But as the  verbal authorisation which he had given was not sufficient, a pen and  paper were given to Sand, and he wrote, with a steady hand and in his  usual writing:    \"I thank the authorities of Mannheim for anticipating my most eager  wishes by making my execution six hours earlier.    \"Sit nomen Domini benedictum.    \"From the prison room, May 20th, day of my deliverance. \"KARL-LUDWIG  SAND.\"    When Sand had given these two lines to the recorder, the physician came  to him to dress his wound, as usual. Sand looked at him with a smile,  and then asked, \"Is it really worth the trouble?\"    \"You will be stronger for it,\" answered the physician.    \"Then do it,\" said Sand.    A bath was brought. Sand lay down in it, and had his long and beautiful  hair arranged with the greatest care; then his toilet being completed,  he put on a frock-coat of the German shape--that is to say, short and  with the shirt collar turned back aver the shoulders, close white  trousers, and high boots. Then Sand seated himself on his bed and prayed  some time in a low voice with the clergy; then, when he had finished, he  said these two lines of Korner's:        \"All that is earthly is ended,       And the life of heaven begins.\"    He next took leave of the physician and the"]]]
