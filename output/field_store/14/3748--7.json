And much beside he told of his loyalty and purity; and,  in short, so wrought upon the people by his words, to which they gave entire  credence, that they all conceived a great veneration for Ser Ciappelletto,  and at the close of the office came pressing forward with the utmost  vehemence to kiss the feet and the hands of the corpse, from which they tore  off the cerements, each thinking himself blessed to have but a scrap thereof  in his possession; and so it was arranged that it should be kept there all  day long, so as to be visible and accessible to all. At nightfall it was  honourably interred in a marble tomb in one of the chapels, where on the  morrow, one by one, folk came and lit tapers and prayed and paid their vows,  setting there the waxen images which they had dedicated. And the fame of  Ciappelletto's holiness and the devotion to him grew in such measure that  scarce any there was that in any adversity would vow aught to any saint but  he, and they called him and still call him San Ciappelletto affirming that  many miracles have been and daily are wrought by God through him for such as  devoutly crave his intercession.    So lived, so died Ser Cepperello da Prato, and came to be reputed a saint,  as you have heard. Nor would I deny that it is possible that he is of the  number of the blessed in the presence of God, seeing that, though his life  was evil and depraved, yet he might in his last moments have made so  complete an act of contrition that perchance God had mercy on him and  received him into His kingdom. But, as this is hidden from us, I speak  according to that which appears, and I say that he ought rather to be in the  hands of the devil in hell than in Paradise. Which, if so it be, is a  manifest token of the superabundance of the goodness of God to usward,  inasmuch as he regards not our error but the sincerity of our faith, and  hearkens unto us when, mistaking one who is at enmity with Him for a friend,  we have recourse to him, as to one holy indeed, as our intercessor for His  grace. Wherefore, that we of this gay company may by His grace be preserved  safe and sound throughout this time of adversity, commend we ourselves in  our need to Him, whose name we began by invoking, with lauds and reverent  devotion and good confidence that we shall be heard.    And so he was silent.    (1) The diminutive of ceppo, stump or log: more commonly written cepperello  (cf. p. 32) or ceppatello. The form ciapperello seems to be found only here.      NOVEL II.    --  Abraham, a Jew, at the instance of Jehannot de Chevigny, goes to the court  of Rome, and having marked the evil life of the clergy, returns to Paris,  and becomes a Christian.  --    Pamfilo's story elicited the mirth of some of the ladies and the hearty  commendation of all, who listened to it with close attention until the end.  Whereupon the queen bade Neifile, who sat next her, to tell a story, that  the commencement thus made of their diversions might have its sequel.  Neifile, whose graces of mind matched the beauty of her person, consented  with a gladsome goodwill, and thus began:--    Pamfilo has shewn by his story that the goodness of God spares to regard our  errors when they result from unavoidable ignorance, and in mine I mean to  shew you how the same goodness, bearing patiently with the shortcomings of  those who should be its faithful witness in deed and word, draws from them  contrariwise evidence of His infallible truth; to the end that what we  believe we may with more assured conviction follow.    In Paris, gracious ladies, as I have heard tell, there was once a great  merchant, a large dealer in drapery, a good man, most loyal and righteous,  his name Jehannot de Chevigny, between whom and a Jew, Abraham by name, also  a merchant, and a man of great wealth, as also most loyal and righteous,  there subsisted a very close friendship. Now Jehannot, observing Abraham's  loyalty and rectitude, began to be sorely vexed in spirit that the soul of  one so worthy and wise and good should perish for want of faith. Wherefore  he began in a friendly manner to plead with him, that he should leave the  errors of the Jewish faith and turn to the Christian verity, which, being  sound and holy, he might see daily prospering and gaining ground, whereas,  on the contrary, his own religion was dwindling and was almost come to  nothing. The Jew replied that he believed that there was no faith sound and  holy except the Jewish faith, in which he was born, and in which he meant to  live and die; nor would anything ever turn him therefrom. Nothing daunted,  however, Jehannot some days afterwards began again to ply Abraham with  similar arguments, explaining to him in such crude fashion as merchants use  the reasons why our faith is better than the Jewish. And though the Jew was  a great master in the Jewish law, yet, whether it was by reason of his  friendship for Jehannot, or that the Holy Spirit dictated the words that the  simple merchant used, at any rate the Jew began to be much interested in  Jehannot's arguments, though still too staunch in his faith to suffer  himself to be converted. But Jehannot was no less assiduous in plying him  with argument than he was obstinate in adhering to his law, insomuch that at  length the Jew, overcome by such incessant appeals, said:--\"Well, well,  Jehannot, thou wouldst have me become a Christian, and I am disposed to do  so, provided I first go to Rome and there see him whom thou callest God's  vicar on earth, and observe what manner of life he leads and his brother  cardinals with him; and if such it be that thereby, in conjunction with thy  words, I may understand that thy faith is better than mine, as thou hast  sought to shew me, I will do as I have said: otherwise, I will remain as I  am a Jew.\" When Jehannot heard this, he was greatly distressed, saying to  himself:--\"I thought to have converted him; but now I see that the pains  which I took for so excellent a purpose are all in vain; for, if he goes to  the court of Rome and sees the iniquitous and foul life which the clergy  lead there, so far from turning Christian, had he been converted already, he  would without doubt relapse into Judaism.\" Then turning to Abraham he said:-  -\"Nay, but, my friend, why wouldst thou be at all this labour and great  expense of travelling from here to Rome? to say nothing of the risks both by  sea and by land which a rich man like thee must needs run. Thinkest thou  not, to find here one that can give thee baptism? And as for any doubts that  thou mayst have touching the faith to which I point thee, where wilt thou  find greater masters and sages therein than here, to resolve thee of any  question thou mayst put to them? Wherefore in my opinion this journey of  thine is superfluous. Think that the prelates there are such as thou mayst  have seen here, nay, as much better as they are nearer to the Chief Pastor.  And so, by my advice thou wilt spare thy pains until some time of  indulgence, when I, perhaps, may be able to bear thee company.\" The Jew  replied:--\"Jehannot, I doubt not that so it is as thou sayst; but once and  for all I tell thee that I am minded to go there, and will never otherwise  do that which thou wouldst have me and hast so earnestly besought me to do.\"  \"Go then,\" said Jehannot, seeing that his mind was made up, \"and good luck  go with thee;\" and so he gave up the contest because nothing would be lost,  though he felt sure that he would never become a Christian after seeing the  court of Rome. The Jew took horse, and posted with all possible speed to  Rome; where on his arrival he was honourably received by his fellow Jews. He  said nothing to any one of the purpose for which he had come; but began  circumspectly to acquaint himself with the ways of the Pope and the  cardinals and the other prelates and all the courtiers; and from what he saw  for himself, being a man of great intelligence, or learned from others, he  discovered that without distinction of rank they were all sunk in the most  disgraceful lewdness, sinning not only in the way of nature but after the  manner of the men of Sodom, without any restraint of remorse or shame, in  such sort that, when any great favour was to be procured, the influence of  the courtesans and boys was of no small moment. Moreover he found them one  and all gluttonous, wine-bibbers, drunkards, and next after lewdness, most  addicted to the shameless service of the belly, like brute beasts. And, as  he probed the matter still further, he perceived that they were all so  greedy and avaricious that human, nay Christian blood, and things sacred of  what kind soever, spiritualities no less than temporalities, they bought and  sold for money; which traffic was greater and employed more brokers than the  drapery trade and all the other trades of Paris put together; open simony  and gluttonous excess being glosed under such specious terms as  \"arrangement\" and \"moderate use of creature comforts,\" as if God could not  penetrate the thoughts of even the most corrupt hearts, to say nothing of  the signification of words, and would suffer Himself to be misled after the  manner of men by the names of things. Which matters, with many others which  are not to be mentioned, our modest and sober-minded Jew found by no means  to his liking, so that, his curiosity being fully satisfied, he was minded  to return to Paris; which accordingly he did. There, on his arrival, he was  met by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#11)"],[1,"education, I may here enumerate just a few of the many simple  performances, which, with firmness, gentleness, and patience, you may  easily teach any cat of ordinary brain calibre.  A cat may be taught to  beg like a dog; to embrace you; to pat your nose or your neighbour's  nose when told--(N.B. It's just as well it should _always_ be your  neighbour's nose)--to down charge; to watch by a mouse's hole; to stand  in a corner on her hind legs; to move rhythmically to music; to mew when  told; to shut her eyes when told; to leap six or eight feet through a  hoop or over your head; to feign sleep; to feign death; to open or shut  a door; to ring the bell; to fish; to swim, and retrieve either in the  water or on the land.    I have a cat who, if I hold her up in front of the map of London, will  place her paw upon any principal building I like to name.  The cat has  been used to be carried round the room to catch flies on the wall.  The  principal buildings in the map are marked with square black spots, which  she naturally mistakes for flies, so you have only to hold her in front  of the map nearest to the spot you want her to touch, and slightly  elevate your voice when you name the place, and the thing is done.    CHAPTER TWELVE.    AGREMENS OF CAT LIFE.    Before we can thoroughly understand the ways and habits of any animal,  we must try, in a manner, to put ourselves in that animal's place, and  thus be able to study life from its point of view.    I don't believe that God made any creature to be otherwise than happy,  and He has endowed each member of His creation with just that amount of  reason and instinct which shall enable it to find its food and a place  to rest in, make love in its own way, marry after its own fashion--by  civil contract--bring up its young, and, in a word, be generally jolly.  I found a poor bee this morning getting drowned in the water-butt.  \"Yes,\" I said, \"I'll save your life, but I will give you as a treat to  my pet spider.\"  Man has the proposing, but not the disposing.  I laid  my bee for one moment on the edge of the butt to dry, when whirr! away  he darted through the bright morning sunshine, and my spider had to be  content with a bluebottle for breakfast.  This spider, I may tell you,  is a very large and beautiful specimen, striped and marked like a silver  tabby.  He lives in an outhouse, and has a web, the network of which is  a yard in diameter, with goodness knows how many feet of tack, and  sheet, and stay, and guy.  And a very amusing rascal he is, and not a  bit afraid of me.  Nearly every day, I give him a bee with the sting  out.  (It is in the kaleidoscope of events; that some day I may leave  the sting in, just to see how he feels it.)  I place the bee in the web,  and it is amusing to see how quickly my friend shins up the rigging--he  catches the bee by the shoulders, and makes him spin for a few seconds  like a top, till he is completely enveloped in a gauzy shroud, and there  is a big hole in the web.  I tell my spider he shouldn't make a hole in  the web.  \"Never mind that,\" he replies, \"soon make that all right,\" and  sure enough next morning the web is nicely repaired, and the bee nearly  eaten.  I don't think he eats all the bee himself.  I am convinced that  he has a little wife who lives somewhere in a corner, and that every day  he is careful to send her a leg, or a wing, or a bit of the breast.  Well, he is happy, I know.  Hadn't he a nice private house, without rent  or taxes, maybe a wife, and a thriving business, to say nothing at all  about the bee.  I have studied cats as I have studied that spider.  I  have imagined myself that spider.  I have been, or imagined myself to  be, a cat--a Tom, you know, and I can fully understand a pussy's life  and a pussy's joys and sorrows.    \"How different,\" I thought, as I mused one morning under a tree, \"is the  life of a cat from that of a dog.  I'm the parson's cat to be sure, but  then I'm my own master.  Now, there is the parson's Saint Bernard dog,  Dumpling for instance,--an honest, contented fellow enough, but, bless  you, he isn't free.  _I_ am.  Dumpling can't do as he pleases.  I can.  I can go to bed when I like, rise when I like, and eat and drink, when,  where, or what I choose.  Dumpling _can't_.  Really I feel I can forgive  Dumpling for chasing me into the apple-tree last Sunday when I think of  the dull life the dog leads, and how few are his joys compared to mine.  Poor Dumpling needs servants to wait upon him, and he can't even walk a  couple of miles, and make sure of his way home, or sure of not getting  into a row, or not getting stolen, or something else equally ridiculous.  The other day Dumpling actually sat on the door-step for two hours in  the rain, till his great shaggy coat was wet through and through,  because, forsooth, he didn't know how to get the door opened.  Would I  have done that?  No.  I should have walked up politely to the first  kind-faced passenger, and asked that passenger to `be good enough to  ring this bell for me, please, 'cause I ain't big enough,' and the thing  would have been done.  Could Dumpling unlatch a door or catch a mouse?  Could he climb a tree and rob a sparrow's nest? or could he find his way  home over the tiles on a dark night?  I would laugh to see him try.    \"Now here am I on this bright, beautiful summer morning, as fresh as a  daisy, as happy as a king.  Catch me sleeping in the house on a summer's  night!    \"How sweetly the birds are singing, but how much more sweetly they will  taste!  What a glorious day I had of it yesterday all through!  Put in  an appearance at the parson's breakfast-table, just for fashion's sake,  and pretended to drink the milk my kind mistress placed before me.  Fairly won the old lady's heart by rubbing my head affectionately  against the canary's cage.  `Dear Tom,' said she, `_you_ would never  touch the pretty bird?'  Oh! wouldn't I, though?    \"What a nasty old man that Farmer Trump is!  I'm sure, if it wasn't that  I have a taste for pigeons, and am a little bit of a Columbarian, I  would never have thought of looking at his lot, anyhow.  Besides, I had  only eaten two when in came _he_, and out went _I_.  Well, if he didn't  take his gun and fire after me.  Well, if he hadn't done anything of the  sort, he wouldn't have shot his bantam cock.    \"I didn't go into that milk cellar of my own free will.  It was purely  accidental.  I was chased by a dog, but being in, how could I, being  only a thirsty cat, and amid such profusion, help helping myself to a  drop of cream?  And if the clumsy old dairymaid hadn't thrown her shoe  at me, she wouldn't have broken the milk-house window.  It was no  business of mine.  I met Master Black-and-tan outside, and warmed him.  I gave _him_ sore eyes.  That old shoe brought luck with it, however,  for about an hour after I found myself in a large and beautiful garden,  filled with beds of the rarest flowers.  It isn't always you get a bed  made for you, thinks I; so I scraped about me a bit, and went off to  sleep in the sun.  Where did that half-brick come from?  I wonder.  I'm  somehow of opinion that it was meant for me.  However, if people will  use profane language, and heave bricks at the heads of unoffending cats,  they mustn't be astonished if they do smash the cucumber frame.    \"I find it so much better to live in the free forest, because, if I live  in the house, a day never passes that I do not get into a row, and I  always get the worst of it.  Only yesterday I looked in for a few  minutes at tea-time, and there was Dumpling standing, with a yard of  tongue hanging from one side of his mouth; and Master must pat him, and  call him a fine fellow; then I jumped on the sofa-stool, and smacked him  in the face, and Dumpling knocked down the stool to get at me, besides a  cup and saucer, with his wisp of a tail, and I bolted through a pane of  glass, and got blamed for that.  Day before, a mouse was pleased to get  behind a china vase, and I had to break the vase to get at it--I got  blamed for that.  Same day I ran away with a mackerel.  That mackerel  seemed positively to say, `Oh, pussy, do run away with me, and eat me in  some nice, quiet corner.'  And I did; and, would you believe it, I was  even blamed for that!    \"I'm going to see Zelina to-night.  Zelina is a beautiful black Persian  angel, with hazel eyes and flowing fur, and a voice that would lure the  larks from the sky.  Zelina belongs to the barber, and I met her by  appointment in the back garden, and found her very thick with three  other fellows.  That's the worst of Zelina.  But I fellowed them!  For  five minutes you wouldn't have seen either of us for fluff, and at the  end of that time little remained of the other cats save the teeth.  Meanwhile Zelina looked calmly on.  Then I wooed Zelina beneath the  moon, and thrashed her, and beat her, and bit her, till at last she  consented to fly with me to a foreign shore; but we made such a row that  we awoke the brute of a barber, and he threw a basin of dirty water  right over us, and there was no more foreign shore thought of.  But I'll  see her to-night, sweet Zelina!\"    I'll conclude this paper with a rather curious anecdote, told me by  Captain A. Brown, late of Arbroath, now of Chatham, Canada.  \"We have a  cat,\" says Captain Brown, \"who brought up a kitten in a loft above the  woodshed, until it was old enough to wean; she then brought it down to  run about, but the dog (a puppy) would on every opportunity take the  kitten in its mouth and drag it about.  This the cat didn't seem to  like, so one day she took it in her mouth, and carried it along, on the  top of the fence, to the nearest farm, a quarter of a mile off, where  the _kitten's father lived_.  She placed the kitten at the male parent's  feet, gave it suck once more, then started off home along the fence, and  never went near it again.\"    This anecdote, for the truth of"]]]
