The  chain may be stapled to the log.    Another good way is to find their holes in the bank and set a trap in  the entrance, staking into deep water.    If the water is still, and there is much grass in the water, look  around, and you will find their feeding beds,--beds of grass which  appear to be floating on the water. Set traps on these beds, under  water.    If you know there are muskrats about and you can not find any of the  places described above, select a steep bank, and set the trap under  two or three inches of water at the foot of the bank. Pin a piece of  bait to the bank about ten inches above the trap.    Where muskrats are found in large numbers as in a pond or slough,  proceed as follows: Get a board about twelve inches wide and sixteen  feet long and nail strips across it, arranging them in pairs, just  far enough apart to let a trap set between. A board of this size will  hold six or eight traps. The traps may be stapled to the edge of the  board and some small pieces of bait scattered the entire length. The  traps should be covered with dirt or dead grass. Attach a rope to one  end of the board and anchor it in the water where the muskrats are  sure to find it.    To trap muskrats in their houses in winter, cut a hole in the side of  the house, and set the trap inside, on the bed. Fasten the trap to a  stick outside of the house and close the opening tight, so the diving  hole will not freeze. I have had best success at this kind of  trapping by using a small trap, No. 0, and a good length of chain, as  it gives the rat more chance to drown. The traps should be visited  evening and morning.    In the spring, when the ice has just commenced to melt, you will find  small piles of grass roots projecting above the ice. Move this aside  and you will find a hole in the ice, with a feed bed directly in  under it. Set a trap on this bed and cover the hole.    The best baits for muskrats are sweet apple, parsnips, carrot,  pumpkin, corn and the flesh of the muskrat. While they do not eat the  meat, they will go to smell at it, which is all that is needed.  Muskrat musk, beaver castor and catnip are all attractive to the  muskrat.      [Illustration: The Red Fox.]        CHAPTER X.    THE FOX.    The various members of the fox family are found in almost all parts  of the world but are most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere. There  are many species and varieties, but it is those of North America that  are of the most interest to the trapper.    Those found on this continent are the red, the gray, the kit and  Arctic foxes, and there are a number of varieties of the red and gray  species. The black, silver and cross foxes are supposed to be only  color varieties of the red, but why this occurs, and only in the  North, is a mystery.    The Silver or Black fox is the most beautiful and most valuable of  all the foxes. It is found in the high, northern latitudes of both  continents. In this country, it is found as far south as the northern  tier of states. They are most abundant in the interior of Alaska, the  Northwest Territories, Ontario, Northern Quebec, Labrador and  Newfoundland.    At the London fur sales, specimens have been sold at over one  thousand dollars each, but the average price is probably about two  hundred dollars. Wherever the Silver fox is found, the Cross or Patch  fox is found also, and they also range somewhat farther south. They  are always found in greater numbers than the Silver variety.    The red fox is the most common and is distributed over a larger  territory than the other varieties. They range from the northern  timber line, to well down in the Southern States. They are probably  most abundant in the Eastern provinces of Canada and the England  States, but they are found in fair numbers in parts of New York,  Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan  and the larger part of Canada and Alaska.    The Gray fox is one of the least valuable, and is most abundant in  the Southern States. In the East they range as far north as  Connecticut, In some places they have supplanted the Red species, and  in other places the grays have disappeared and the reds have taken  their place.    The fox, as well as the wolf and coyote, belongs to the dog family,  which is second, only to man in intelligence. The different species  are all practically the same size, but the same varieties vary in  size in different localities. The average weight is from nine to ten  pounds. In general appearance they somewhat resemble the dog, being  rather light of build, considering their height. The ears are erect  and pointed, the tail thick and bushy, and the muzzle small and  pointed. The fur varies in the different species, being coarse and  rather short on the Gray, while that of the Silver fox is extremely  fine and soft.    The mating season comes in February, and e young are born usually in  April, there being from four to nine in a litter. They make dens in  the sand hills and in rocky districts, den in the rocks. Except  during the breeding season they spend very little time in the dens,  but lie during the day in some clump of brush or weeds, or often on  top of a stump or log. In mountainous sections they lie during the  day, somewhere on the mountain side and come down into the valleys at  night in search of food.    The fox is not strictly a carnivorous animal. When food is scarce  they often feed on apples and other fruits, but their regular food is  flesh. They are fond of partridge, rabbits, mice, skunk, muskrat or  opossum flesh, carrion of almost all kinds, fish, eggs, poultry, and  often they come around the camps and gather up the scraps, bread,  bacon rinds etc. If they are given time and not disturbed they become  quite bold in coming to such places for food and the trappers  sometime take advantage of this peculiarity by baiting them awhile  before setting the trap.    The fox in the North becomes prime in the beginning of November and  remains in good condition until the middle of March, when the fur  begins to take on a rubbed and woolly appearance. In the South they  do not become prime until the last of November or the beginning of  December and go out of prime in February. Most of the foxes are  trapped in the fall before the ground freezes too hard for dry sets,  and of course, many of them are not prime.    The traps recommended for the fox, for dry land use are the Nos. 2  and 3 Oneida Jump and Blake & Lamb, the 1 1/2 Newhouse and Hawley &  Norton and the No. 2 Victor. For water and snow trapping, the Nos. 3  and 4 Oneida Jump and Blake & Lamb, and the 21 1/2 and 31 1/2  Newhouse will be found most desirable.    In places where there are springs and small streams, there is no  better method than the old water set, which is made as follows: It is  best to find a spring which does not freeze, but for early fall  trapping a brook will do. The rise and fall of the water in small  streams sometimes makes trouble, and a spring or small pond gives  best results. The spring should be at least four feet in diameter and  should be prepared for the set in the summer, but if care is used,  may be fixed up during the trapping season. A moss covered stone, or  a sod (according to surroundings) should be placed about a foot and a  half from shore, and should rise about two or three inches above the  water. This is the bait sod. The trap is set half way between the sod  and the shore, and the jaws, springs and chain should be covered with  mud, or whatever is found in the bottom of the spring.      [Illustration: Water Set for Fox.]    The pan of the trap should just be covered with water. Now take a  nice piece of moss or sod and place it on the pan of the trap, so  that it will rise an inch above the water. When properly placed, this  sod will look natural and will, apparently be a safe stepping place  for the fox. The pan should be so adjusted that it will not spring  too easily. A small piece of bait and also some scent should be  placed on the larger sod.    In making this set you should wade up the outlet of the spring, and  stand in the water while making the set. Do not touch the bank or any  of the surroundings. The trap should be fitted with a chain about  three feet in length, with a two prong drag attached, but most  trappers simply wire a stone of eight or ten pounds weight to the end  of the chain. The drag, whatever is used, should be buried in the bed  of the spring.    I recommend the flesh of the muskrat, skunk, opossum or house-cat for  bait, and it should be allowed to taint by remaining about a week in  a glass jar. This method was first used by William Schofield a famous  fox trapper of the Eastern states. Two men have been known to catch  over one hundred foxes in a season with this method, besides  considerable other furs taken in the same traps, for the method is  good for many other animals besides the fox.    One trapper recommends setting the trap in exactly the same manner,  except that the bait sod is omitted, and the bait, a bird, is  fastened by means of a stick thrust in the bottom of the spring. The  stick must be entirely out of sight, and the bird, apparently,  floating in the water. Both of these methods are very good, and are  especially recommended for the novice, as they are the easiest and  surest methods to start on.    The water sets given above, can of course, only be used in certain  places, for in some of the best fox countries, springs cannot be  found, and even the streams are not suitable for trapping. For this  reason many professional fox trappers prefer to use dry land sets,  and the blind set will be found to be one of the very best.    Look for fox tracks in old stock trails, foot paths, old roads in the  woods, openings under fences, etc., and having"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#11)"],[1,"ther-in-law.    Subsequently he took part in battles against his own people, and in the  third battle was killed on the field. Tenderly the Crow warriors bore  him back to their camp, and great was the mourning in the Crow village  for the brave man who always went into battle unarmed, save only the  willow wand which he carried.    Thus ended the career of one of the bravest of Sioux warriors who ever  took the scalp of an enemy, and who for the love of his dead wife, gave  up home, parents, and friends, to be killed on the field of battle by  his own tribe.              THE BOY AND THE TURTLES    A boy went on a turtle hunt, and after following the different streams  for hours, finally came to the conclusion that the only place he would  find any turtles would be at the little lake, where the tribe always  hunted them.    So, leaving the stream he had been following, he cut across country to  the lake. On drawing near the lake he crawled on his hands and knees in  order not to be seen by the turtles, who were very watchful, as they had  been hunted so much. Peeping over the rock he saw a great many out on  the shore sunning themselves, so he very cautiously undressed, so  he could leap into the water and catch them before they secreted  themselves. But on pulling off his shirt one of his hands was held up  so high that the turtles saw it and jumped into the lake with a great  splash.    The boy ran to the shore, but saw only bubbles coming up from the  bottom. Directly the boy saw something coming to the surface, and soon  it came up into sight. It was a little man, and soon others, by the  hundreds, came up and swam about, splashing the water up into the air to  a great height. So scared was the boy that he never stopped to gather  up his clothes but ran home naked and fell into his grandmother's tent  door.    \"What is the trouble, grandchild,\" cried the old woman. But the boy  could not answer. \"Did you see anything unnatural?\" He shook his head,  \"no.\" He made signs to the grandmother that his lungs were pressing so  hard against his sides that he could not talk. He kept beating his side  with his clenched hands. The grandmother got out her medicine bag,  made a prayer to the Great Spirit to drive out the evil spirit that had  entered her grandson's body, and after she had applied the medicine, the  prayer must have been heard and answered, as the boy commenced telling  her what he had heard and seen.    The grandmother went to the chief's tent and told what her grandson had  seen. The chief sent two brave warriors to the lake to ascertain whether  it was true or not. The two warriors crept to the little hill close to  the lake, and there, sure enough, the lake was swarming with little men  swimming about, splashing the water high up into the air. The warriors,  too, were scared and hurried home, and in the council called on their  return told what they had seen. The boy was brought to the council  and given the seat of honor (opposite the door), and was named \"Wankan  Wanyanka\" (sees holy).    The lake had formerly borne the name of Truth Lake, but from this time  on was called \"Wicasa-bde\"--Man Lake.                THE HERMIT, OR THE GIFT OF CORN    In a deep forest, far from the villages of his people, lived a hermit.  His tent was made of buffalo skins, and his dress was made of deer skin.  Far from the haunts of any human being this old hermit was content to  spend his days.    All day long he would wander through the forest studying the different  plants of nature and collecting precious roots, which he used as  medicine. At long intervals some warrior would arrive at the tent of  the old hermit and get medicine roots from him for the tribe, the old  hermit's medicine being considered far superior to all others.    After a long day's ramble in the woods, the hermit came home late, and  being very tired, at once lay down on his bed and was just dozing off  to sleep, when he felt something rub against his foot. Awakening with a  start, he noticed a dark object and an arm was extended to him, holding  in its hand a flint pointed arrow.    The hermit thought, \"This must be a spirit, as there is no human being  around here but myself!\" A voice then said: \"Hermit, I have come to  invite you to my home.\" \"How (yes), I will come,\" said the old hermit.  Wherewith he arose, wrapped his robe about him and followed.    Outside the door he stopped and looked around, but could see no signs of  the dark object.    \"Whoever you are, or whatever you be, wait for me, as I don't know  where to go to find your house,\" said the hermit. Not an answer did  he receive, nor could he hear any noises as though anyone was walking  through the brush. Re-entering his tent he retired and was soon fast  asleep. The next night the same thing occurred again, and the hermit  followed the object out, only to be left as before.    He was very angry to think that anyone should be trying to make sport of  him, and he determined to find out who this could be who was disturbing  his night's rest.    The next evening he cut a hole in the tent large enough to stick an  arrow through, and stood by the door watching. Soon the dark object came  and stopped outside of the door, and said: \"Grandfather, I came to--,\"  but he never finished the sentence, for the old man let go his arrow,  and he heard the arrow strike something which produced a sound as though  he had shot into a sack of pebbles. He did not go out that night to see  what his arrow had struck, but early next morning he went out and looked  at the spot about where he thought the object had stood. There on the  ground lay a little heap of corn, and from this little heap a small line  of corn lay scattered along a path. This he followed far into the woods.  When he came to a very small knoll the trail ended. At the end of the  trail was a large circle, from which the grass had been scraped off  clean.    \"The corn trail stops at the edge of this circle,\" said the old man, \"so  this must be the home of whoever it was that invited me.\" He took his  bone knife and hatchet and proceeded to dig down into the center of the  circle. When he had got down to the length of his arm, he came to a sack  of dried meat. Next he found a sack of Indian turnips, then a sack of  dried cherries; then a sack of corn, and last of all another sack, empty  except that there was about a cupful of corn in one corner of it, and  that the sack had a hole in the other corner where his arrow had pierced  it. From this hole in the sack the corn was scattered along the trail,  which guided the old man to the cache.*    From this the hermit taught the tribes how to keep their provisions when  traveling and were overloaded. He explained to them how they should dig  a pit and put their provisions into it and cover them with earth. By  this method the Indians used to keep provisions all summer, and when  fall came they would return to their cache, and on opening it would find  everything as fresh as the day they were placed there.    The old hermit was also thanked as the discoverer of corn, which had  never been known to the Indians until discovered by the old hermit.    *Hiding place.              THE MYSTERIOUS BUTTE    A young man was once hunting and came to a steep hill. The east side  of the hill suddenly dropped off to a very steep bank. He stood on  this bank, and at the base he noticed a small opening. On going down to  examine it more closely, he found it was large enough to admit a horse  or buffalo. On either side of the door were figures of different animals  engraved into the wall.    He entered the opening and there, scattered about on the floor, lay many  bracelets, pipes and many other things of ornament, as though they had  been offerings to some great spirit. He passed through this first room  and on entering the second it was so dark that he could not see his  hands before his face, so becoming scared, he hurriedly left the place,  and returning home told what he had seen.    Upon hearing this the chief selected four of his most daring warriors to  go with this young man and investigate and ascertain whether the young  man was telling the truth or not. The five proceeded to the butte, and  at the entrance the young man refused to go inside, as the figures on  either side of the entrance had been changed.    The four entered and seeing that all in the first chamber was as the  young man had told, they went on to the next chamber and found it so  dark that they could not see anything. They continued on, however,  feeling their way along the walls. They finally found an entrance that  was so narrow that they had to squeeze into it sideways. They felt their  way around the walls and found another entrance, so low down that  they had to crawl on their hands and knees to go through into the next  chamber.    On entering the last chamber they found a very sweet odor coming from  the opposite direction. Feeling around and crawling on their hands and  knees, they discovered a hole in the floor leading downward. From this  hole came up the sweet odor. They hurriedly held a council, and decided  to go no further, but return to the camp and report what they had found.  On getting to the first chamber one of the young men said: \"I am going  to take these bracelets to show that we are telling the truth.\" \"No,\"  said the other three, \"this being the abode of some Great Spirit, you  may have some accident befall you for taking what is not yours.\" \"Ah!  You fellows are like old women,\" said he, taking a fine bracelet and  encircling his left wrist with it.    When they reached the village they reported what they had seen. The  young man exhibited the bracelet to prove that it was the truth they had  told.    Shortly after this, these four young men were out fixing up traps for  wolves. They would raise one end of a heavy log and place a stick under,  bracing up the log. A large piece of meat was placed about five"]]]
