The knowledge that there are no other atomic facts is positive  general knowledge; it is the knowledge that \"all atomic facts are known  to me,\" or at least \"all atomic facts are in this collection\"--however  the collection may be given. It is easy to see that general  propositions, such as \"all men are mortal,\" cannot be known by inference  from atomic facts alone. If we could know each individual man, and know  that he was mortal, that would not enable us to know that all men are  mortal, unless we _knew_ that those were all the men there are, which is  a general proposition. If we knew every other existing thing throughout  the universe, and knew that each separate thing was not an immortal man,  that would not give us our result unless we _knew_ that we had explored  the whole universe, _i.e._ unless we knew \"all things belong to this  collection of things I have examined.\" Thus general truths cannot be  inferred from particular truths alone, but must, if they are to be  known, be either self-evident, or inferred from premisses of which at  least one is a general truth. But all _empirical_ evidence is of  _particular_ truths. Hence, if there is any knowledge of general truths  at all, there must be _some_ knowledge of general truths which is  independent of empirical evidence, _i.e._ does not depend upon the data  of sense.    The above conclusion, of which we had an instance in the case of the  inductive principle, is important, since it affords a refutation of the  older empiricists. They believed that all our knowledge is derived from  the senses and dependent upon them. We see that, if this view is to be  maintained, we must refuse to admit that we know any general  propositions. It is perfectly possible logically that this should be the  case, but it does not appear to be so in fact, and indeed no one would  dream of maintaining such a view except a theorist at the last  extremity. We must therefore admit that there is general knowledge not  derived from sense, and that some of this knowledge is not obtained by  inference but is primitive.    Such general knowledge is to be found in logic. Whether there is any  such knowledge not derived from logic, I do not know; but in logic, at  any rate, we have such knowledge. It will be remembered that we excluded  from pure logic such propositions as, \"Socrates is a man, all men are  mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal,\" because Socrates and _man_ and  _mortal_ are empirical terms, only to be understood through particular  experience. The corresponding proposition in pure logic is: \"If anything  has a certain property, and whatever has this property has a certain  other property, then the thing in question has the other property.\" This  proposition is absolutely general: it applies to all things and all  properties. And it is quite self-evident. Thus in such propositions of  pure logic we have the self-evident general propositions of which we  were in search.    A proposition such as, \"If Socrates is a man, and all men are mortal,  then Socrates is mortal,\" is true in virtue of its _form_ alone. Its  truth, in this hypothetical form, does not depend upon whether Socrates  actually is a man, nor upon whether in fact all men are mortal; thus it  is equally true when we substitute other terms for Socrates and _man_  and _mortal_. The general truth of which it is an instance is purely  formal, and belongs to logic. Since it does not mention any particular  thing, or even any particular quality or relation, it is wholly  independent of the accidental facts of the existent world, and can be  known, theoretically, without any experience of particular things or  their qualities and relations.    Logic, we may say, consists of two parts. The first part investigates  what propositions are and what forms they may have; this part enumerates  the different kinds of atomic propositions, of molecular propositions,  of general propositions, and so on. The second part consists of certain  supremely general propositions, which assert the truth of all  propositions of certain forms. This second part merges into pure  mathematics, whose propositions all turn out, on analysis, to be such  general formal truths. The first part, which merely enumerates forms, is  the more difficult, and philosophically the more important; and it is  the recent progress in this first part, more than anything else, that  has rendered a truly scientific discussion of many philosophical  problems possible.    The problem of the nature of judgment or belief may be taken as an  example of a problem whose solution depends upon an adequate inventory  of logical forms. We have already seen how the supposed universality of  the subject-predicate form made it impossible to give a right analysis  of serial order, and therefore made space and time unintelligible. But  in this case it was only necessary to admit relations of two terms. The  case of judgment demands the admission of more complicated forms. If all  judgments were true, we might suppose that a judgment consisted in  apprehension of a _fact_, and that the apprehension was a relation of a  mind to the fact. From poverty in the logical inventory, this view has  often been held. But it leads to absolutely insoluble difficulties in  the case of error. Suppose I believe that Charles I. died in his bed.  There is no objective fact \"Charles I.'s death in his bed\" to which I  can have a relation of apprehension. Charles I. and death and his bed  are objective, but they are not, except in my thought, put together as  my false belief supposes. It is therefore necessary, in analysing a  belief, to look for some other logical form than a two-term relation.  Failure to realise this necessity has, in my opinion, vitiated almost  everything that has hitherto been written on the theory of knowledge,  making the problem of error insoluble and the difference between belief  and perception inexplicable.    Modern logic, as I hope is now evident, has the effect of enlarging our  abstract imagination, and providing an infinite number of possible  hypotheses to be applied in the analysis of any complex fact. In this  respect it is the exact opposite of the logic practised by the classical  tradition. In that logic, hypotheses which seem _prima facie_ possible  are professedly proved impossible, and it is decreed in advance that  reality must have a certain special character. In modern logic, on the  contrary, while the _prima facie_ hypotheses as a rule remain  admissible, others, which only logic would have suggested, are added to  our stock, and are very often found to be indispensable if a right  analysis of the facts is to be obtained. The old logic put thought in  fetters, while the new logic gives it wings. It has, in my opinion,  introduced the same kind of advance into philosophy as Galileo  introduced into physics, making it possible at last to see what kinds of  problems may be capable of solution, and what kinds must be abandoned as  beyond human powers. And where a solution appears possible, the new  logic provides a method which enables us to obtain results that do not  merely embody personal idiosyncrasies, but must command the assent of  all who are competent to form an opinion.          LECTURE III    ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD      Philosophy may be approached by many roads, but one of the oldest and  most travelled is the road which leads through doubt as to the reality  of the world of sense. In Indian mysticism, in Greek and modern monistic  philosophy from Parmenides onward, in Berkeley, in modern physics, we  find sensible appearance criticised and condemned for a bewildering  variety of motives. The mystic condemns it on the ground of immediate  knowledge of a more real and significant world behind the veil;  Parmenides and Plato condemn it because its continual flux is thought  inconsistent with the unchanging nature of the abstract entities  revealed by logical analysis; Berkeley brings several weapons, but his  chief is the subjectivity of sense-data, their dependence upon the  organisation and point of view of the spectator; while modern physics,  on the basis of sensible evidence itself, maintains a mad dance of  electrons which has, superficially at least, very little resemblance to  the immediate objects of sight or touch.    Every one of these lines of attack raises vital and interesting  problems.    The mystic, so long as he merely reports a positive revelation, cannot  be refuted; but when he _denies_ reality to objects of sense, he may be  questioned as to what he means by \"reality,\" and may be asked how their  unreality follows from the supposed reality of his super-sensible world.  In answering these questions, he is led to a logic which merges into  that of Parmenides and Plato and the idealist tradition.    The logic of the idealist tradition has gradually grown very complex and  very abstruse, as may be seen from the Bradleian sample considered in  our first lecture. If we attempted to deal fully with this logic, we  should not have time to reach any other aspect of our subject; we will  therefore, while acknowledging that it deserves a long discussion, pass  by its central doctrines with only such occasional criticism as may  serve to exemplify other topics, and concentrate our attention on such  matters as its objections to the continuity of motion and the infinity  of space and time--objections which have been fully answered by modern  mathematicians in a manner constituting an abiding triumph for the  method of logical analysis in philosophy. These objections and the  modern answers to them will occupy our fifth, sixth, and seventh  lectures.    Berkeley's attack, as reinforced by the physiology of the sense-organs  and nerves and brain, is very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#11)"],[1,"said that night, \"Hear him now, see him  pretty soon.\" But not for many days.    One more sample to encourage would-be moose hunters, and then we will  kill a moose just to show how easy it is. Two nights after the above  adventure we changed our camp and the weather at the same time. It was  clear now, but it grew very cold, and made night work in the canoe a  horror.    It was my brother's turn to call, and I was just dropping off to sleep  in my tent, within a few feet of the lake shore, when from the other  side of the water, about a quarter of a mile distant, a bull moose  called. On the cold, still air it rang out like a trumpet--a long call,  very different from the call made by Indian hunters. Jocko, who was with  me in camp, was frantic with excitement, especially as my brother, who  must have heard it, did not answer. Again the call sounded. The bull  must be on the shore. I thought he might swim over. Then came the  answering call, close at hand, of a cow. Jocko laughed and whispered,  \"Chabot call him.\" Then there was silence for a few minutes, followed by  a final bellow, evidently further off. The mock cow bawled and screamed  and bleated frantically, but no sound came back. My brother and his man  kept it up until late that night, and then came to the camp almost  frozen. That incident ruined my faith in calling, for every condition of  wind and weather was perfect, and Chabot's calling apparently most  enticing.    After this and similar episodes, we left the Kwingwishe country, after  hunting it carefully as far north as Sassanega Lake. We passed Sair's  Lake and the Bois Franc, and finally reached the Little Beauchene. Near  the last lake my brother killed a young bull moose, whose meat was the  first fresh food, except partridge, we had had for over three weeks. It  was delicious, and we felt the change of diet at once in increased  strength and energy. For continuous use moose meat is much superior to  other venison, as it is of a rich flavor which does not readily pall on  the taste. The myth about moose muffle being such a hunters' delicacy  has never allured me to actually eat it, but I suppose a starving man  might, after consuming his boots, manage to swallow it.    There were many fresh signs in the neighborhood of the Little Beauchene  Lake, but some lumbermen had arrived a few days before us and had  scared the game away. This starting the quarry is the real difficulty in  moose hunting; for, when once disturbed, the bull leaves with all his  kith and kin, so the only chance in these regions is to find him  immediately on arrival in a new district and before he comes across your  tracks.    Still working slowly southward, we hunted more back ponds, until at last  my turn came on the twenty-seventh hunting day. Let no man say that  moose hunting is a picnic.    We had camped on a little strip of land, between a pond and a long  narrow swamp, about 4 o'clock on a beautiful afternoon. Leaving my  brother and Jocko to eat dinner in comfort, I started to the head of the  swamp. The water was so low that we could barely force the light canoe  through the lily-pads. Old moose signs were plenty. A family of moose  had evidently been there all summer, but until we reached the upper end  we saw no fresh tracks. The sluggish stream we were on drained a shallow  lake, and, after a few hard plunges, our canoe floated clear of the mud  into the silent waters of a circular pond. It was a basin about a half  mile across, surrounded by low hardwood hills, and so shallow that a  moose, I think, could have waded across the deepest part. The shores  were marked up with some very large tracks, but fresh signs had long  since ceased to excite in me anything more than a passing interest. We  made the tour of the lake slowly and quietly. Nothing was in sight  except four wood ducks. This was \"last chance\" pond, and if I got no  moose here, we must return to Mattawa for another outfit, which I had  about made up my mind to do. The night settled still and cold--oh, so  cold!--and the stars came out with wonderful distinctness.    What was that?    Chabot had started up, listened, and a second later was driving the  birch across the lake noiselessly. As we neared the shore, it was inky  black--a mammoth would not have been visible ten yards away. Twigs  breaking at long intervals told that something was on shore just in  cover of the bushes. We waited some time and at last I whispered to  Chabot, \"Muckwa?\" (bear).    \"Not muckwa--cow,\" answered the guide.    As he spoke, the short call of a bull floated out on the cold air from  the side of the pond that we had just left. I think Chabot was right  about the cow being in the bushes, but he may have been mistaken--one's  hearing becomes unnaturally sensitive after a few weeks' continuous  straining to catch and distinguish the most distant sounds. But there  was no mistake about that bull's call. He was well back from the shore  on the hillside. The wind was wrong, and, although he grunted at  intervals for an hour, he paid no attention to Chabot's most seductive  pleadings. We imitated with paddles the splashings of a cow walking in  the shallow water, but this and other devices had no effect. When at  last even my Indian could no longer bear the bitter cold of the wind  which had sprung up, we started for camp. Long past midnight we crawled  into our blankets, and I dropped asleep cursing the day I had first gone  after moose.    We were on that pond again before daylight. Not a sound to be heard, not  a living thing to be seen, when the sun rose. We took our stand on a  small point opposite the outlet and watched. I sat on a fallen tree  motionless, hour after hour. Chabot dozed beside me. Those four ducks  played and fed within thirty feet, and a muskrat worked at  house-building a few yards away. The silence was intense. There was not  a breath of wind. I knew my brother was doing the same thing on a  neighboring pond, and I fell to thinking whether there was some special  Nemesis about this hunt, or it was the fault of the guides. I glanced at  the outlet in front of me, about a half mile distant.    There was a moose, stalking with the utmost deliberation along the edge  of the woods and then into the shallow water.    Chabot was roused by a hasty shake, and a second later the canoe was  flying across the lake. As we crossed, I inspected the moose closely. He  was walking slowly, nibbling the long reed-like grass that stuck up from  the water. His neck seemed very stiff, and he swung his legs from his  hips and shoulders. The hump was extremely conspicuous, perhaps because  his head was carried low to get at the grass. He was a young bull,  nearly full grown, and with small antlers. He looked occasionally at the  canoe, now fast nearing him; but we had the advantage of the wind, and  the sun was going down behind us. It was just 5 o'clock. He walked, now  out toward us, now back to shore, as though about to bolt for the bush,  but working slowly toward the north, where we afterwards found a  much-used runway, leading to the marsh my brother was watching, two  miles away. I opened fire about fifty yards off, when the moose was  standing in about a foot of water, looking suspiciously at us. The shot  was too high, but struck him in the shoulder. He started in a lumbering  gallop along the shore. I fired again. This turned him into the woods at  an old lumber road. We heard the twigs snap sharply for a minute, and  then a heavy crash and silence. I thought we had lost him, but Chabot  declared that he was down. I sprang ashore the moment the canoe  grounded, and dashed in on his trail, which was perfectly clear on the  soft moss. Looking ahead through the open woods for the animal, which I  thought had turned, I almost fell over his prostrate body.    His head rested against a small windfall, which he had tried to  clear--an effort which appeared to have cost him his life. Moss hung  from some small spruce trees close by, which had been kicked up in the  death struggle. The shoulder shot had been the fatal one, but he had  been hard hit in the side too.    He was not full grown, and measured only 5 feet 6-1/2 inches in height,  and 8 feet 3-1/4 inches in length, from the nose to root of tail. His  girth at the shoulder was 5 feet 11-1/4 inches. His nose showed none of  the Jewish characteristics which taxidermists are fond of giving their  mounted moose heads. The forehead and shoulders were brownish instead of  black, like the rest of the body. The hindlegs were wholly white, as  were the forelegs below the knee. I am inclined to think he was a ranger  moose, but could not tell with certainty, as his horns were too  undeveloped. The velvet was still hanging in places, but very dry. This  was unusual, as it was the 10th of October.    Ordering Chabot to dress the moose, I went back to the canoe, having  decided to watch until dark, although there seemed no possibility of  seeing another moose after the firing. My lazy guide, instead of obeying  my order, merely cut the skin, with the result that all the meat  spoiled--probably just what he wanted, fearing he would have to portage  it out of the bush. We returned to our point and dozed again. At a  quarter of 7 it was getting dark fast, and in the north a black,  ugly-looking cloud was gathering. We might as well go back to camp if it  was going to blow and rain, so I told Chabot to shove off and to give  one last toot of his horn, just for luck.    The air was still as death with the dread of the impending storm. Chabot  took up the coiled birch, and the echoes rang out with a short grunting  call, which so much resembles a man chopping wood. Before they died  away, there came from behind us, just to our right, the unmistakable  answering grunt of a bull moose. He was probably on his way to the lake,  and our call merely hastened him and brought him out into the open  before it was too dark to shoot."]]]
