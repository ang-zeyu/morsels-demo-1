The man who had watched the lick nearest the camp, and quite an old  man, said that I could watch the lick that he had watched and he  would stay in camp. (The men now acknowledged me as a thoroughbred  hunter, you see.) Well, I was getting there pretty lively, I thought,  when an old hunter would give up his lick to me, when only the  evening before none of the men thought that I was up to watching a  lick at any price.    I was pleased to again have a place to watch. Taking some punk wood  to make a little smoke to keep off the gnats and mosquitoes, I  started for the lick and climbed the Indian ladder to the scaffold,  built in a hemlock tree.    I had barely got fixed in shape to begin to watch when I chanced to  look towards a small ravine that came down from the hill a few yards  to my left and saw what I took to be a black yearling steer. I will  add that the woods in that locality were covered with a rank growth  of nettles, cow cabbage and other wood's feed, and people would drive  their young cattle off into that locality to run during the summer. I  thought I would get down from the scaffold and throw stones at it and  drive it off lest it might come into the lick after dark and I might  take it for a deer and shoot it.    As I started to climb down I again looked in the direction of the  steer, and this time I saw what I thought was the largest bear that  ever traveled the woods. He had left the ravine and was walking with  his head down, going up the hill and past the lick. I cocked both  barrels of the gun and raised it carefully to my shoulder, and,  breaking a little dry twig I had in my hand caused the bear to stop  and turn his head around so as to look down the hill. This was my  time so I leveled on his head and shoulders and let go both barrels  of the gun at once.    The bear went into the air and then began tumbling and rolling down  the hill towards the tree that I was in, bawling and snorting like  mad. But if the bear made a howl from pain he was in, it was no  comparison to the howl that I made for help and it did not cease  until the men in camp came on the run thinking that I had  accidentally shot myself. Well, this was my first bear and it was the  greatest day of my life.    We took the bear to camp, skinned and dressed it and then went to  bunk for the night, but it was very little I slept for I could only  think what a mighty hunter I was (in my mind).    The men came in in the morning with no better luck than they had the  night before, and they all declared that if I had not been with them  they would have had to go without venison.    The men said that we had meat in plenty now and that we would not  watch the licks any more that time, so they put in their time jerking  the venison and also some of the bear meat. They built a large fire  of hemlock bark, and when it was burned down to a bed of coals so  that there was no longer any smoke, they made a rack or grate of  small poles, laid in crotches driven in the ground, so as to have the  grate over the coals, and then laid the slices of venison on this  grate and stood green bark about the grate to form a sort of an oven.  The strips of meat were first sprinkled with salt and wrapped up in  the skin from the deer and allowed to remain wrapped in the skin for  a few hours until the salt would strike through the meat so as to  make it about right as to salt.    The men remained in camp about a week. They would shoot at a mark,  pitch quoits and have jumping contests and other amusements,  including fishing, eating trout, venison and bear meat along with  toasted bread and coffee and potatoes roasted in the ashes.    * * *    The time had arrived when I thought that I must take to the taller  timber to trap and hunt. I searched among the boys of my age, in the  neighborhood, for a partner who would go with me to the Big Woods, as  the section where I wished to go, was called. I finally found a pard  who said he would go with me and stay as long as I cared to.    The middle of October came. We packed our knapsacks with a grub  stake, a blanket or two, and taking our guns started for the Big  Woods, with a feeling that is not known to those who are not lovers  of the wild.    As we only had a limited number of steel traps it was our intention  to spend the first week in camp, building deadfalls for coon and mink  and use the steel traps for fox. Our intention was to build as many  deadfalls as we would be able to attend to before we baited and set  any of them. We had built our traps on many of the small brooks and  streams to the south and east of the camp, and had built traps on the  stream on which the camp was located nearly a mile below camp.    About a mile and a half below camp there was another branch coming in  from the north. Pard and I started early one morning to finish the  line of traps on the camp stream and then go up the stream that came  from the north and build as many traps as we could during the balance  of the day. We had finished the line of traps on the camp stream, and  had built a trap or two on the other branch, when pard complained of  having a bad headache, but refused to go to camp. We built another  trap or two, when pard consented to go to camp, if I would build  another trap on a little spring run where coon signs were plentiful,  which I readily consented to do. When I got the trap done it was  nearly sundown.    It was about three miles to camp so I hurried to see how pard was  feeling. I had not gone more than a half mile on my way from where  pard turned back to go to camp, when I found him lying on the ground.  He said that he was feeling so sick that he was unable to go any  further and complained that every bone in his body ached.    After explaining to pard the conditions under which we were placed,  it was with difficulty that I managed to get him up, and by  supporting and half carrying him I managed to get him along a few  rods at a time. I could see that he was continually growing worse.  After I had helped until we were within about three-quarters of a  mile of camp, he begged me to let him lie down and rest. I tried to  urge him along by explaining that I must go for a team to get him out  of the woods, and that I could not leave him lying there on the damp  ground. It was of no use; I could not get him to go any further.  While I was somewhat older than pard, he was much the heavier, and I  was unable to carry him.    Taking in the situation, there was only one thing for me to do and  that was to leave him and go for help. After making him promise that  as soon as he rested he would work his way to camp I took off my  coat, and put it under him, again making him promise to get to camp,  I started for help.    The night was dark and it was miles through the woods to the first  house. When I came to camp I stopped long enough to get a bite to eat  which I took in my hand. After lighting a fire so if pard did manage  to get to camp he would have a good fire, I started for help.  Wherever the light would get through the trees enough so that I could  see the path, I would take a trot. After the first mile and a half I  came to the turnpike road where I could make better time although it  was dense woods. After about six or seven miles I reached the first  clearing and from there the rest of the way was more or less  clearings and I could see the road better and was able to make better  time.    I reached pard's home about a mile before I came to my home, rattled  at the door and called for pard's father. I told him the condition of  his son. He requested me to go to my home and get some of my family  to take a team and start back at once after his son; he would go  after a doctor and have the doctor there when we got back with the  boy. I lost no time in getting started back. We could not get nearer  than a mile and a half to the camp, as we were obliged to leave the  wagon road at that point, and go down a very steep hill and only a  trail cut through the woods. When we reached the camp, contrary to  expectations, we found Orlando (that was pard's name) lying in the  bunk in camp but he said that he was feeling no better. It was after  midnight and we lost no time in getting him on one of the horses and  started back to the wagon which we reached with some difficulty. On  reaching the wagon we laid him on a straw bed which we had brought  for the purpose and got back to his home sometime after daybreak.    The doctor was there and after examining pard said he feared it was a  bad case of fever. I waited a few days to see if he would be able to  go back to camp and then the doctor told me that he would not be out  of bed in two months and advised me to keep out of the woods or I  would be brought out on a stretcher. I had my mind on all those  deadfalls that we had built and all the coon, mink and fox that we  could catch, and was determined to go back to camp notwithstanding  our friend's advice to the contrary. After looking around for another  partner which I was unable to find as no one wished to go and stay  longer than a day or two (what we call summer trappers), I again  packed my knapsack and went back to camp. The next morning, after  catching a good lot of trout for coon and mink bait, I began the work  of setting the hundred or more deadfalls that pard and I had built.  As soon as I had all the deadfalls set I hunted up good places to set  the traps that we had. I was so busy all the time that there was no  chance to get lonesome. Every day there were coon and mink to skin  and stretch. Now and then a big, old coon was so strong that he would  tear the deadfall to pieces and I would be compelled to build it all  over and make it stronger.    What a difference there is now with the many styles of traps and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#11)"],[1,"of the depths of passionate joy there are  in life and in bountiful, glorious nature. Instead of the strength of  a prison one feels the ecstasy of space; instead of the safety of  inclosure, the rapture of naked publicity. But the public to whom this  place of the great king is consigned is a public of Theban hills; of  the sunbeams striking from them over the wide world toward the east;  of light airs, of drifting sand grains, of singing birds, and of  butterflies with pure white wings. If you have ever ridden an Arab  horse, mounted in the heart of an oasis, to the verge of the great  desert, you will remember the bound, thrilling with fiery animation,  which he gives when he sets his feet on the sand beyond the last  tall date-palms. A bound like that the soul gives when you sit in  the Ramesseum, and see the crowding sunbeams, the far-off groves of  palm-trees, and the drowsy mountains, like shadows, that sleep beyond  the Nile. And you look up, perhaps, as I looked that morning, and upon a  lotus column near you, relieved, you perceive the figure of a young man  singing.    A young man singing! Let him be the tutelary god of this place, whoever  he be, whether only some humble, happy slave, or the \"superintendent of  song and of the recreation of the king.\" Rather even than Amun-Ra  let him be the god. For there is something nobly joyous in this  architecture, a dignity that sings.    It has been said, but not established, that Rameses the Great was buried  in the Ramesseum, and when first I entered it the \"Lay of the Harper\"  came to my mind, with the sadness that attends the passing away of  glory into the shades of death. But an optimism almost as determined  as Emerson's was quickly bred in me there. I could not be sad, though  I could be happily thoughtful, in the light of the Ramesseum. And even  when I left the thinking-place, and, coming down the central aisle, saw  in the immersing sunshine of the Osiride Court the fallen colossus of  the king, I was not struck to sadness.    Imagine the greatest figure in the world--such a figure as this Rameses  was in his day--with all might, all glory, all climbing power, all  vigor, tenacity of purpose, and granite strength of will concentrated  within it, struck suddenly down, and falling backward in a collapse of  which the thunder might shake the vitals of the earth, and you have this  prostrate colossus. Even now one seems to hear it fall, to feel the warm  soil trembling beneath one's feet as one approaches it. A row of statues  of enormous size, with arms crossed as if in resignation, glowing in the  sun, in color not gold or amber, but a delicate, desert yellow, watch  near it like servants of the dead. On a slightly lower level than there  it lies, and a little nearer the Nile. Only the upper half of the figure  is left, but its size is really terrific. This colossus was fifty-seven  feet high. It weighed eight hundred tons. Eight hundred tons of syenite  went to its making, and across the shoulders its breadth is, or was,  over twenty-two feet. But one does not think of measurements as one  looks upon it. It is stupendous. That is obvious and that is enough. Nor  does one think of its finish, of its beautiful, rich color, of any of  its details. One thinks of it as a tremendous personage laid low, as  the mightiest of the mighty fallen. One thinks of it as the dead Rameses  whose glory still looms over Egypt like a golden cloud that will not  disperse. One thinks of it as the soul that commanded, and lo! there  rose up above the sands, at the foot of the hills of Thebes, the  exultant Ramesseum.          XII    DEIR-EL-BAHARI    Place for Queen Hatshepsu! Surely she comes to a sound of flutes, a  merry noise of thin, bright music, backed by a clashing of barbaric  cymbals, along the corridors of the past; this queen who is shown upon  Egyptian walls dressed as a man, who is said to have worn a beard, and  who sent to the land of Punt the famous expedition which covered her  with glory and brought gold to the god Amun. To me most feminine she  seemed when I saw her temple at Deir-el-Bahari, with its brightness and  its suavity; its pretty shallowness and sunshine; its white, and blue,  and yellow, and red, and green and orange; all very trim and fanciful,  all very smart and delicate; full of finesse and laughter, and breathing  out to me of the twentieth century the coquetry of a woman in 1500 B.C.  After the terrific masculinity of Medinet-Abu, after the great freedom  of the Ramesseum, and the grandeur of its colossus, the manhood of all  the ages concentrated in granite, the temple at Deir-el-Bahari came upon  me like a delicate woman, perfumed and arranged, clothed in a creation  of white and blue and orange, standing--ever so knowingly--against  a background of orange and pink, of red and of brown-red, a smiling  coquette of the mountain, a gay and sweet enchantress who knew her  pretty powers and meant to exercise them.    Hatshepsu with a beard! Never will I believe it. Or if she ever seemed  to wear one, I will swear it was only the tattooed ornament with which  all the lovely women of the Fayum decorate their chins to-day, throwing  into relief the smiling, soft lips, the delicate noses, the liquid eyes,  and leading one from it step by step to the beauties it precedes.    Mr. Wallis Budge says in his book on the antiquities of Egypt: \"It would  be unjust to the memory of a great man and a loyal servant of Hatshepsu,  if we omitted to mention the name of Senmut, the architect and overseer  of works at Deir-el-Bahari.\" By all means let Senmut be mentioned, and  then let him be utterly forgotten. A radiant queen reigns here--a  queen of fantasy and splendor, and of that divine shallowness--refined  frivolity literally cut into the mountain--which is the note of  Deir-el-Bahari. And what a clever background! Oh, Hatshepsu knew what  she was doing when she built her temple here. It was not the solemn  Senmut (he wore a beard, I'm sure) who chose that background, if I know  anything of women.    Long before I visited Deir-el-Bahari I had looked at it from afar. My  eyes had been drawn to it merely from its situation right underneath  the mountains. I had asked: \"What do those little pillars mean? And are  those little doors?\" I had promised myself to go there, as one promises  oneself a _bonne bouche_ to finish a happy banquet. And I had realized  the subtlety, essentially feminine, that had placed a temple there.  And Menu-Hotep's temple, perhaps you say, was it not there before the  queen's? Then he must have possessed a subtlety purely feminine, or have  been advised by one of his wives in his building operations, or by some  favorite female slave. Blundering, unsubtle man would probably think  that the best way to attract and to fix attention on any object was to  make it much bigger than things near and around it, to set up a giant  among dwarfs.    Not so Queen Hatshepsu. More artful in her generation, she set her  long but little temple against the precipices of Libya. And what is the  result? Simply that whenever one looks toward them one says, \"What are  those little pillars?\" Or if one is more instructed, one thinks about  Queen Hatshepsu. The precipices are as nothing. A woman's wile has  blotted them out.    And yet how grand they are! I have called them tiger-colored precipices.  And they suggest tawny wild beasts, fierce, bred in a land that is the  prey of the sun. Every shade of orange and yellow glows and grows pale  on their bosses, in their clefts. They shoot out turrets of rock that  blaze like flames in the day. They show great teeth, like the tiger when  any one draws near. And, like the tiger, they seem perpetually informed  by a spirit that is angry. Blake wrote of the tiger:         \"Tiger, tiger, burning bright       In the forests of the night.\"    These tiger-precipices of Libya are burning things, avid like beasts of  prey. But the restored apricot-colored pillars are not afraid of their  impending fury--fury of a beast baffled by a tricky little woman, almost  it seems to me; and still less afraid are the white pillars, and the  brilliant paintings that decorate the walls within.    As many people in the sad but lovely islands off the coast of Scotland  believe in \"doubles,\" as the old classic writers believed in man's  \"genius,\" so the ancient Egyptian believed in his \"Ka,\" or separate  entity, a sort of spiritual other self, to be propitiated and ministered  to, presented with gifts, and served with energy and ardor. On this  temple of Deir-el-Bahari is the scene of the birth of Hatshepsu, and  there are two babies, the princess and her Ka. For this imagined Ka,  when a great queen, long after, she built this temple, or chapel, that  offerings might be made there on certain appointed days. Fortunate Ka  of Hatshepsu to have had so cheerful a dwelling! Liveliness pervades  Deir-el-Bahari. I remember, when I was on my first visit to Egypt,  lunching at Thebes with Monsieur Naville and Mr. Hogarth, and afterward  going with them to watch the digging away of the masses of sand and  rubbish which concealed this gracious building. I remember the songs of  the half-naked workmen toiling and sweating in the sun, and I remember  seeing a white temple wall come up into the light with all the painted  figures surely dancing with joy upon it. And they are surely dancing  still.    Here you may see, brilliant as yesterday's picture anywhere,  fascinatingly decorative trees growing bravely in little pots, red  people offering incense which is piled up on mounds like mountains,  Ptah-Seket, Osiris receiving a royal gift of wine, the queen in the  company of various divinities, and the terrible ordeal of the cows.  The cows are being weighed in scales. There are three of them. One is  a philosopher, and reposes with an air that says, \"Even this last  indignity of being weighed against my will cannot perturb my soaring  "]]]
