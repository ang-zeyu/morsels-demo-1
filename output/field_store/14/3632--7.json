[ABnormal END] 1. Abnormal termination (of software); [317]crash;     [318]lossage. Derives from an error message on the IBM 360; used     jokingly by hackers but seriously mainly by [319]code grinders.     Usually capitalized, but may appear as `abend'. Hackers will try to     persuade you that ABEND is called `abend' because it is what system     operators do to the machine late on Friday when they want to call it a     day, and hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'. 2.     [alt.callahans] Absent By Enforced Net Deprivation - used in the     subject lines of postings warning friends of an imminent loss of     Internet access. (This can be because of computer downtime, loss of     provider, moving or illness.) Variants of this also appear: ABVND =     `Absent By Voluntary Net Deprivation' and ABSEND = `Absent By     Self-Enforced Net Deprivation' have been sighted.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:accumulator, Next:[320]ACK, Previous:[321]ABEND, Up:[322]= A =       accumulator n. obs.       1. Archaic term for a register. On-line use of it as a synonym for     `register' is a fairly reliable indication that the user has been     around for quite a while and/or that the architecture under discussion     is quite old. The term in full is almost never used of microprocessor     registers, for example, though symbolic names for arithmetic registers     beginning in `A' derive from historical use of the term `accumulator'     (and not, actually, from `arithmetic'). Confusingly, though, an `A'     register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for example on     the Motorola 680x0 family. 2. A register being used for arithmetic or     logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index), especially one being     used to accumulate a sum or count of many items. This use is in     context of a particular routine or stretch of code. \"The FOOBAZ     routine uses A3 as an accumulator.\" 3. One's in-basket (esp. among     old-timers who might use sense 1). \"You want this reviewed? Sure, just     put it in the accumulator.\" (See [323]stack.)       _________________________________________________________________       Node:ACK, Next:[324]Acme, Previous:[325]accumulator, Up:[326]= A =       ACK /ak/ interj.       1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110] Acknowledge. Used to     register one's presence (compare mainstream Yo!). An appropriate     response to [327]ping or [328]ENQ. 2. [from the comic strip \"Bloom     County\"] An exclamation of surprised disgust, esp. in \"Ack pffft!\"     Semi-humorous. Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and     is distinguished by a following exclamation point. 3. Used to politely     interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point (see     [329]NAK). Thus, for example, you might cut off an overly long     explanation with \"Ack. Ack. Ack. I get it now\". 4. An affirmative.     \"Think we ought to ditch that damn NT server for a Linux box?\" \"ACK!\"       There is also a usage \"ACK?\" (from sense 1) meaning \"Are you there?\",     often used in email when earlier mail has produced no reply, or during     a lull in [330]talk mode to see if the person has gone away (the     standard humorous response is of course [331]NAK (sense 1), i.e., \"I'm     not here\").       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Acme, Next:[332]acolyte, Previous:[333]ACK, Up:[334]= A =       Acme n.       The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and non-functional     gadgetry - where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who     specialized in elaborate contraptions) shop. The name has been     humorously expanded as A (or American) Company Making Everything. (In     fact, Acme was a real brand sold from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the     early 1900s.) Describing some X as an \"Acme X\" either means \"This is     [335]insanely great\", or, more likely, \"This looks [336]insanely great     on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself in the     foot with it.\" Compare [337]pistol.       This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained here     for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the Warner     Brothers' series of \"Roadrunner\" cartoons. In these cartoons, the     famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to catch up with, trap,     and eat the Roadrunner. His attempts usually involved one or more     high-technology Rube Goldberg devices - rocket jetpacks, catapults,     magnetic traps, high-powered slingshots, etc. These were usually     delivered in large cardboard boxes, labeled prominently with the Acme     name. These devices invariably malfunctioned in improbable and violent     ways.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:acolyte, Next:[338]ad-hockery, Previous:[339]Acme, Up:[340]= A =       acolyte n. obs.

[Purdue] 1. Gratuitous assumptions made inside certain programs, esp.     expert systems, which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent     behavior but are in fact entirely arbitrary. For example,     fuzzy-matching of input tokens that might be typing errors against a     symbol table can make it look as though a program knows how to spell.     2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would     otherwise cause a program to [346]choke, presuming normal inputs are     dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way. Also called     `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/), `ad-crockery'. See also     [347]ELIZA effect.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Ada, Next:[348]address harvester, Previous:[349]ad-hockery,     Up:[350]= A =       Ada n.       A [351]Pascal-descended language that was at one time made mandatory     for Department of Defense software projects by the Pentagon. Hackers     are nearly unanimous in observing that, technically, it is precisely     what one might expect given that kind of endorsement by fiat; designed     by committee, crockish, difficult to use, and overall a disastrous,     multi-billion-dollar boondoggle (one common description wss \"The PL/I     of the 1980s\"). Hackers find Ada's exception-handling and     inter-process communication features particularly hilarious. Ada     Lovelace (the daughter of Lord Byron who became the world's first     programmer while cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his     mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly     blanch at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest     thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good     small language screaming to get out from inside its vast,     [352]elephantine bulk.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:address harvester, Next:[353]adger, Previous:[354]Ada, Up:[355]=     A =       address harvester n.       A robot that searches web pages and/or filters netnews traffic looking     for valid email addresses. Some address harvesters are benign, used     only for compiling address directories. Most, unfortunately, are run     by miscreants compiling address lists to [356]spam. Address harvesters     can be foiled by a [357]teergrube.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:adger, Next:[358]admin, Previous:[359]address harvester,     Up:[360]= A =       adger /aj'r/ vt.

Short for `administrator'; very commonly used in speech or on-line to     refer to the systems person in charge on a computer. Common     constructions on this include `sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing     the administrator's role as a site contact for email and news) or     `newsadmin' (focusing specifically on news). Compare [367]postmaster,     [368]sysop, [369]system mangler.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:ADVENT, Next:[370]AFAIK, Previous:[371]admin, Up:[372]= A =       ADVENT /ad'vent/ n.       The prototypical computer adventure game, first designed by Will     Crowther on the [373]PDP-10 in the mid-1970s as an attempt at     computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented     game by Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. (Woods had been one of the     authors of [374]INTERCAL.) Now better known as Adventure or Colossal     Cave Adventure, but the [375]TOPS-10 operating system permitted only     six-letter filenames. See also [376]vadding, [377]Zork, and     [378]Infocom.       This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in     text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have     become fixtures of hacker-speak: \"A huge green fierce snake bars the     way!\" \"I see no X here\" (for some noun X). \"You are in a maze of     twisty little passages, all alike.\" \"You are in a little maze of     twisty passages, all different.\" The `magic words' [379]xyz"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3013"],[0,"The Birds (#11)"],[1," the thousand paths of poetry in  turn...\"      f(1) There was a real Cinesias--a dythyrambic poet born at Thebes.    PISTHETAERUS This is a fellow will need a whole shipload of wings.    CINESIAS (singing) \"...and being fearless and vigorous, it is seeking  fresh outlet.\"    PISTHETAERUS Welcome, Cinesias, you lime-wood man!(1) Why have you come  here a-twisting your game leg in circles?      f(1) The scholiast thinks that Cinesias, who was tall and slight of  build, wore a kind of corset of lime-wood to support his waist--surely  rather a far-fetched interpretation!    CINESIAS \"I want to become a bird, a tuneful nightingale.\"    PISTHETAERUS Enough of that sort of ditty. Tell me what you want.    CINESIAS Give me wings and I will fly into the topmost airs to gather  fresh songs in the clouds, in the midst of the vapours and the fleecy  snow.    PISTHETAERUS Gather songs in the clouds?    CINESIAS 'Tis on them the whole of our latter-day art depends. The most  brilliant dithyrambs are those that flap their wings in void space  and are clothed in mist and dense obscurity. To appreciate this, just  listen.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! no, no, no!    CINESIAS By Hermes! but indeed you shall. \"I shall travel through thine  ethereal empire like a winged bird, who cleaveth space with his long  neck...\"    PISTHETAERUS Stop! easy all, I say!(1)      f(1) The Greek word used here was the word of command employed to stop  the rowers.    CINESIAS \"...as I soar over the seas, carried by the breath of the  winds...\"    PISTHETAERUS By Zeus! but I'll cut your breath short.    CINESIAS \"...now rushing along the tracks of Notus, now nearing Boreas  across the infinite wastes of the ether.\" (PISTHETAERUS BEATS HIM.) Ah!  old man, that's a pretty and clever idea truly!    PISTHETAERUS What! are you not delighted to be cleaving the air?(1)      f(1) Cinesias makes a bound each time that Pisthetaerus strikes him.    CINESIAS To treat a dithyrambic poet, for whom the tribes dispute with  each other, in this style!(1)      f(1) The tribes of Athens, or rather the rich citizens belonging to  them, were wont on feast-days to give representations of dithyrambic  choruses as well as of tragedies and comedies.    PISTHETAERUS Will you stay with us and form a chorus of winged birds as  slender as Leotrophides(1) for the Cecropid tribe?      f(1) Another dithyrambic poet, a man of extreme leanness.    CINESIAS You are making game of me, 'tis clear; but know that I shall  never leave you in peace if I do not have wings wherewith to traverse  the air.    AN INFORMER What are these birds with downy feathers, who look so  pitiable to me? Tell me, oh swallow with the long dappled wings.(1)      f(1) A parody of a hemistich from 'Alcaeus.'--The informer is  dissatisfied at only seeing birds of sombre plumage and poor appearance.  He would have preferred to denounce the rich.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! but 'tis a regular invasion that threatens us. Here  comes another of them, humming along.    INFORMER Swallow with the long dappled wings, once more I summon you.    PISTHETAERUS It's his cloak I believe he's addressing; 'faith, it stands  in great need of the swallows' return.(1)      f(1) The informer, says the scholiast, was clothed with a ragged cloak,  the tatters of which hung down like wings, in fact, a cloak that could  not protect him from the cold and must have made him long for the  swallows' return, i.e. the spring.    INFORMER Where is he who gives out wings to all comers?    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis I, but you must tell me for what purpose you want  them.    INFORMER Ask no questions. I want wings, and wings I must have.    PISTHETAERUS Do you want to fly straight to Pellene?(1)      f(1) A town in Achaia, where woollen cloaks were made.    INFORMER I? Why, I am an accuser of the islands,(1) an informer...      f(1) His trade was to accuse the rich citizens of the subject islands,  and drag them before the Athenian court; he explains later the special  advantages of this branch of the informer's business.    PISTHETAERUS A fine trade, truly!    INFORMER ...a hatcher of lawsuits. Hence I have great need of wings to  prowl round the cities and drag them before justice.    PISTHETAERUS Would you do this better if you had wings?    INFORMER No, but I should no longer fear the pirates; I should return  with the cranes, loaded with a supply of lawsuits by way of ballast.    PISTHETAERUS So it seems, despite all your youthful vigour, you make it  your trade to denounce strangers?    INFORMER Well, and why not? I don't know how to dig.    PISTHETAERUS But, by Zeus! there are honest ways of gaining a living at  your age without all this infamous trickery.    INFORMER My friend, I am asking you for wings, not for words.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis just my words that give you wings.    INFORMER And how can you give a man wings with your words?    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis thus that all first start.    INFORMER All?    PISTHETAERUS Have you not often heard the father say to young men in the  barbers' shops, \"It's astonishing how Diitrephes' advice has made my son  fly to horse-riding.\"--\"Mine,\" says another, \"has flown towards tragic  poetry on the wings of his imagination.\"    INFORMER So that words give wings?    PISTHETAERUS Undoubtedly; words give wings to the mind and make a man  soar to heaven. Thus I hope that my wise words will give you wings to  fly to some less degrading trade.    INFORMER But I do not want to.    PISTHETAERUS What do you reckon on doing then?    INFORMER I won't belie my breeding; from generation to generation we  have lived by informing. Quick, therefore, give me quickly some light,  swift hawk or kestrel wings, so that I may summon the islanders, sustain  the accusation here, and haste back there again on flying pinions.    PISTHETAERUS I see. In this way the stranger will be condemned even  before he appears.    INFORMER That's just it.    PISTHETAERUS And while he is on his way here by sea, you will be flying  to the islands to despoil him of his property.    INFORMER You've hit it, precisely; I must whirl hither and thither like  a perfect humming-top.    PISTHETAERUS I catch the idea. Wait, i' faith, I've got some fine  Corcyraean wings.(1) How do you like them?      f(1) That is, whips--Corcyra being famous for these articles.    INFORMER Oh! woe is me! Why, 'tis a whip!    PISTHETAERUS No, no; these are the wings, I tell you, that set the top  a-spinning.    INFORMER Oh! oh! oh!    PISTHETAERUS Take your flight, clear off, you miserable cur, or you will  soon see what comes of quibbling and lying. Come, let us gather up our  wings and withdraw.    CHORUS In my ethereal flights I have seen many things new and strange  and wondrous beyond belief. There is a tree called Cleonymus belonging  to an unknown species; it has no heart, is good for nothing and is as  tall as it is cowardly. In springtime it shoots forth calumnies instead  of buds and in autumn it strews the ground with bucklers in place of  leaves.(1)    Far away in the regions of darkness, where no ray of light ever enters,  there is a country, where men sit at the table of the heroes and dwell  with them always--save always in the evening. Should any mortal meet the  hero Orestes at night, he would soon be stripped and covered with blows  from head to foot.(2)      f(1) Cleonymous is a standing butt of Aristophanes' wit, both as an  informer and a notorious poltroon.    f(2) In allusion to the cave of the bandit Orestes; the poet terms him a  hero only because of his heroic name Orestes.    PROMETHEUS Ah! by the gods! if only Zeus does not espy me! Where is  Pisthetaerus?    PISTHETAERUS Ha! what is this? A masked man!    PROMETHEUS Can you see any god behind me?    PISTHETAERUS No, none. But who are you, pray?    PROMETHEUS What's the time, please?    PISTHETAERUS The time? Why, it's past noon. Who are you?    PROMETHEUS Is it the fall of day? Is it no later than that?(1)      f(1) Prometheus wants night to come and so reduce the risk of being seen  from Olympus.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! 'pon my word! but you grow tiresome.    PROMETHEUS What is Zeus doing? Is he dispersing the clouds or gathering  them?(1)      f(1) The clouds would prevent Zeus seeing what was happening below him.    PISTHETAERUS Take care, lest I lose all patience.    PROMETHEUS Come, I will raise my mask.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! my dear Prometheus!    PROMETHEUS Stop! stop! speak lower!    PISTHETAERUS Why, what's the matter, Prometheus?    PROMETHEUS H'sh! h'sh! Don't call me by my name; you will be my ruin, if  Zeus should see me here. But, if you want me to tell you how things  are going in heaven, take this umbrella and shield me, so that the gods  don't see me.    PISTHETAERUS I can recognize Prometheus in this cunning trick. Come,  quick then, and fear nothing; speak on.    PROMETHEUS Then listen.    PISTHETAERUS I am listening, proceed!    PROMETHEUS It's all over with Zeus.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! and since when, pray?    PROMETHEUS Since you founded this city in the air. There is not a man  who now sacrifices to the gods; the smoke of the victims no longer  reaches us. Not the smallest offering comes! We fast as though it were  the festival of Demeter.(1) The barbarian gods, who are dying of hunger,  are bawling like Illyrians(2) and threaten to make an armed descent upon  Zeus, if he does not open markets where joints of the victims are sold.      f(1) The third day of the festival of Demeter was a fast.    f(2) A semi-savage people, addicted to violence and brigandage.    PISTHETAERUS What! there are other gods besides you, barbarian gods who  dwell above Olympus?    PROMETHEUS If there were no barbarian gods, who would be the patron of  Execestides?(1)      f(1) Who, being reputed a stranger despite his pretension to the title  of a citizen, could only have a strange god for his patron or tutelary  deity.    PISTHETAERUS And what is the name of these gods?    PROMETHEUS Their name? Why, the Triballi.(1)      f(1)"]]]
