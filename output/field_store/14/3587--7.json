The hand of every creature is against him, from  that of the dragon-fly larva to that of the man with the latest  invention in the way of patent fishing-tackle. It is no wonder if he  turns the tables on his enemies whenever he has a chance, or even if he  sometimes goes so far, in his general ruthlessness, as to eat his own  offspring.    Yet, in spite of our friend's moroseness and solitary habits, there were  certain times and seasons when he did come more or less in contact with  his inferiors. In late spring and early summer he liked to sport for a  while in the swift rapids--perhaps to stretch his muscles after the  dull, quiet life of the winter-time, or possibly to free himself from  certain little insects which sometimes fastened themselves to his body,  and which, for lack of hands, it was rather difficult to get rid of.  Here he often met some of his subjects, and later, when the hot weather  came on, they all went to the spring-holes which formed their summer  resorts. And at such times he never hesitated to take advantage of his  superior size and strength. He always picked out the coolest and most  comfortable places in the pools, and helped himself to the choicest  morsels of food; and the others took what was left, without question.  And when the summer was gone, and the water grew cold and invigorating,  and once more he put on his wedding-garment and hurried away to the  gravelly shallows, how different was his conduct from what it had been  when he was a yearling! Then he was only a hanger-on; now he selected  his nest and his mate to suit himself; and nobody ever dared to  interfere. Whether he ever again chose that beautiful little fish from  the hatchery, whom he had been so fond of when he was a three-year-old,  is a question which I would rather not try to answer. Among all the  vicissitudes, dangers, and rivalries of life in a trout stream, a  permanent marriage seems to be almost an impossibility; and I fear that  the affections of a fish are not remarkable for depth or constancy.    The Trout had altered in many ways besides his relations to his  fellows. The curving lines of his body were not quite as graceful as  they had once been, and sometimes he wore a rather lean and dilapidated  look, especially in the six months from November to May. His tail was  not as handsomely forked as when he was young, but was nearly square  across the end, and was beginning to be a little frayed at the corners.  His lower jaw had grown out beyond the upper, and its extremity was  turned up in a wicked-looking hook which was almost a disfigurement, but  which he often found very useful in hustling a younger trout out of the  way. Even his complexion had grown darker, as we have already seen.  Altogether he was less prepossessing than of old, but of a much more  formidable appearance, and the very look of him was enough to scare a  minnow out of a year's growth.    But, notwithstanding all changes, the two great interests of his  every-day life continued to be just what they had always been--namely,  to get enough to eat, and to keep out of the way of his enemies; for  enemies he still had, and would have as long as he lived. The  fly-fishermen, with their feather-weight rods and their scientific  tackle, came every spring and summer; and only the wisdom born of  experience kept him from falling into their hands. Several times he met  with an otter, and had to run for his life. Once, a black bear, fishing  for suckers, came near catching a brook trout. And perhaps the very  closest of all his close calls came one day when some river-drivers  exploded a stick of dynamite in the water to break up a log-jam. The  trout was some distance up the stream at the time, but the concussion  stunned him so that he floated at the surface, wrong side up, for  several minutes before his senses gradually came back. That is a fish's  way of fainting.    His luck stayed by him, however, and none of these things ever did him  any serious harm. His reign proved a long one, and as the years went by  he came to exercise a more and more autocratic sway over the smaller  fry. For in spite of his age he was still growing. A trout has an  advantage over a land animal in this, that he is not obliged to use any  of his food as fuel for keeping himself warm. He can't keep warm  anyhow--not as long as he lives in the water--and so he doesn't try, but  devotes everything he eats to enlarging his body and repairing wear and  tear. If nothing happens to put a stop to the process, he seems to be  able to keep it up almost indefinitely. But the size of the stream in  which he lives appears to limit him to a certain extent. Probably the  largest trout stream in the world is the Nepigon, and they say that  seventeen-pounders were caught there in the early days. Our friend's  native river was a rather small one. In the course of time, however, he  attained a weight of very nearly three pounds, and I doubt if he would  ever have been much larger. Perhaps it was fitting that his reign should  end there.    But it seems a great pity that it could not have ended in a more  imposing manner. The last act of the drama was so inglorious that I am  almost ashamed to tell it. He was the King of the Trout Stream; over and  over he had run Fate's gauntlet, and escaped with his body unharmed and  his wits sharper than ever; he knew the wiles of the fly-fishermen  better than any other trout in the river; and yet, alas! he fell a  victim to a little Indian boy with a piece of edging for a rod, coarse  string for a line, and salt pork for bait.    I'm sure it wouldn't have happened if he had stayed at home; but one  spring he took it into his head to go on an exploring expedition out  into Lake Superior. I understand that his cousins in the streams of  eastern Canada sometimes visit salt water in somewhat the same manner,  and that they thereupon lose the bright trimmings of their coats and  become a plain silver-gray. Superior did not affect our friend in that  way, but something worse happened to him--he lost his common-sense.  Perhaps his interest in his new surroundings was so great that he forgot  the lessons of wisdom and experience which it had cost him so much to  learn.    In the course of his wanderings he came to where a school of perch were  loafing in the shadow of a wharf; and just as he pushed his way in among  them, that little white piece of fat pork sank slowly down through the  green water. It was something new to the trout; he didn't quite know  what to make of it. But the perch seemed to think it was good, and they  would be sure to eat it if he didn't; and so, although the string was in  plain sight and ought to have been a sufficient warning, he exercised  his royal prerogative, shouldered those yellow-barred plebeians out of  the way, and took the tid-bit for himself. It is too humiliating; let us  draw a veil over that closing scene.    The King of the Trout Stream had gone the way of his fathers, and  another reigned in his stead.          THE STRENUOUS LIFE OF A CANADA LYNX      THE Canada lynx came down the runway that follows the high bank along  the northern shore of the Glimmerglass, his keen, silvery eyes watching  the woods for foe or prey, and his big feet padding softly on the dead  leaves. He was old, was the Canada lynx, and he had grown very tall and  gaunt, but this afternoon his years sat lightly on him. And in a moment  more they had vanished entirely, and he was as young as ever he was in  his life, for, as he stepped cautiously around a little spruce, he came  upon another lynx, nearly as tall as he, and quite as handsome in her  early winter coat. They both stopped short and stared. And no wonder.  Each of them was decidedly worth looking at, especially if the one who  did the looking happened to be another lynx of the opposite sex.    He was some twenty-odd inches in height and about three and a half feet  in length, and had a most villanous cast of countenance, a very  wicked-looking set of teeth, and claws that were two inches long and so  heavy and strong and sharp that you could sometimes hear them crunch  into the bark when he climbed a tree. His long hind legs, heavy  buttocks, thick fore-limbs, and big, clumsy-looking paws told of a  magnificent set of muscles pulling and sliding and hauling under his  cloak. She was nearly as large as he, and very much like him in general  appearance. Both of them wore long, thick fur, of a lustrous steel-gray  color, with paler shades underneath, and darker trimmings along their  back-bones and up and down their legs. Their paws were big and broad and  furry, their tails were stubby and short, and they wore heavy, grizzled  whiskers on the sides of their jaws and mustachios under their noses,  while from the tips of their ears rose tassels of stiff, dark hairs that  had an uncommonly jaunty effect. Altogether they looked very fierce and  imposing and war-like--perhaps rather more so than was justified by  their actual prowess. So it was not surprising that they took to each  other. Perhaps he wasn't really quite as heroic as he appeared, but  that's not uncommon among other lovers besides those belonging to the  lynx tribe, and what difference did it make, anyhow, as long as she  didn't know it?    That winter was a hard one. The cold was intense, the snow was very  deep, and the storms came often. Spruce hens and partridges were scarce,  even rabbits were hard to find, and sometimes it seemed to the two  lynxes as if they were the only animals left in the woods. Except the  deer. There were always plenty of deer down in the cedar swamp, and  their tracks were as plain as a lumberman's logging road. But although  the lynxes sometimes killed and ate young fawns in the summertime, they  seldom tasted venison in the winter. It was well for them that they had  each other, for when one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27975"],[0,"Delineations of the Ox Tribe: The Natural History of Bulls, Bisons, and (#11)"],[1,"little known beyond the limits of his native  mountains, except by the inhabitants of the provinces above mentioned.    \"His disposition is gentle: even when wild in his native hills, he is  not considered to be a dangerous animal; never standing the approach of  man, much less bearing his attack.    \"To avoid the noon-day heat, he retires to the deepest shade of the  forest; preferring the dry acclivity of the hill to repose on, rather  than the low swampy ground below; and never, like the Buffalo, wallowing  in mud.    \"Gayals have been domesticated among the Cucis from time immemorial; and  without any variation in their appearance from the wild stock. No  difference whatever is observed in the colour of the wild and tame  breeds; brown of different shades being the general colour of both.    \"The wild Gayal is about the size of the wild Buffalo of India. The tame  Gayals among the Cucis, being bred in nearly the same habits of freedom,  and on the same food, without ever undergoing any labour, grow to the  same size with the wild ones.    \"The Cucis makes no use whatever of the milk, but rear the Gayals  entirely for the sake of their flesh and skins; they make their shields  of the hides of these animals. The flesh of the Gayal is in the highest  estimation among the Cucis; so much so, that no solemn festival is ever  celebrated without slaughtering one or more Gayals, according to the  importance of the occasion.    \"The domesticated Gayals are allowed by the Cucis to roam at large  during the day, through the forest, in the neighbourhood of the village;  but as evening approaches, they all return home of their own accord; the  young Gayal being early taught this habit, by being regularly fed every  night with salt, of which he is very fond; and from the occasional  continuance of this practice, as he grows up, the attachment of the  Gayal to his native village becomes so strong, that when the Cucis  migrate from it, they are obliged to set fire to the huts which they are  about to leave, lest their Gayals should return thither from their new  place of residence, before they become equally attached to it, as to the  former, through the same means.    \"The wild Gayal sometimes steals out from the forest in the night, and  feeds in the rice fields bordering on the hills. The Cucis give no grain  to their cattle. With us (at Chatgaon) the tame Gayals feed on Calai  _(phaseolus max_); but as our hills abound with shrubs, it has not been  remarked what particular kind of grass they prefer.    \"The Hindus in this province will not kill the Gabay (or Gayal) which  they hold in equal veneration with the cow. But the As'l Gayal, or  Seloi, they hunt and kill, as they do the wild Buffalo. The animal here  alluded to is another species of Gayal found wild in the hills of  Chatgaon. He has never been domesticated, and is in appearance and  disposition very different from the common Gayal which has just been  described. The natives call him the As'l Gayal, in contra-distinction to  the Gabay. The Cucis distinguish him by the name of Seloi; and the Mugs  and Burmas by that of P'hanj, and they consider him, next to the tiger,  the most dangerous and fiercest animal of their forests.\"    Mr. Elliot, in writing from Tipura, says,--\"I have some Gayals at  Munnamutty, and from their mode of feeding I presume that they keep on  the skirts of the vallies, to enable them to feed on the sides of the  mountain, where they can browse; they will not touch grass, if they can  find shrubs.    \"While kept at Camerlah, which is situated in a level country, they used  to resort to the banks, and eat on the sides; frequently betaking  themselves to the water, to avoid the heat of the sun. However, they  became sickly and emaciated, and their eyes suffered much; but, on being  sent to the hills, they soon recovered, and are now (1808) in a healthy  condition. They seem fond of the shade, and are observed in the hot  weather to take the turn of the hills, so as to be always sheltered from  the sun. They do not wallow in mud, like Buffaloes, but delight in  water, and stand in it during the greatest heat of the day, with the  front of their heads above the surface.    \"Each Cow yields from two and a half to about four sers [from five to  eight pounds] of milk, which is rich, sweet, and almost as thick as  cream; it is of a high flavour, and makes excellent butter.\"    We learn from Mr. Dick that the Gayal is called Gaujangali in the  Persian language, Gavaya in Sanscrit, and Mat'hana by the mountaineers;  but others name the animal Gobay-goru.    The tame Gayals, however long they may have been domesticated, do not at  all differ from the wild ones, unless in temper, for the wild ones are  fierce and untractable. The colour of both is the same, namely, that of  the Antelope, but some are white and others black, none are spotted or  piebald. They graze and range like other cattle, and eat rice, mustard,  chiches, and any cultivated produce, as also chaff and chopped straw.    According to this gentleman the Gayal lives to the age of twenty or  twenty-five years, and reaches its full growth at five years. The  female is generally higher than the male. She receives the bull in her  fifth year, and bears after ten months.    In reference to the case of Mr. Bird's Gayal breeding with the common  Zebu, I may observe that this proves nothing beyond the bare fact  stated; no inference whatever of an identity of species can be drawn  from a thousand such cases. It is pretty well known that animals of  perfectly distinct species will, when artificially brought together,  produce hybrids, as in the familiar examples of the Horse and the Ass,  the Canary and the Goldfinch; but a hybrid is neither a species nor  (zoologically speaking) a variety.    In a paper on the Gour, by General Hardwicke, ('Zoological Journal,'  Vol. III,) he introduces the following observations on the Gayal: \"Of  the Gayal (_Bos Gavaeas_ of Colebrooke) there appears to be more than one  species. The provinces of Chatgong and Sylhet produce the wild, or, as  the Natives term it, the Asseel Gayal, and the domesticated one. The  former is considered an untameable animal, extremely fierce, and not to  be taken alive. It rarely quits the mountain tract of the south-east  frontier, and never mixes with the Gobbay, or village Gayal of the  plains. I succeeded in obtaining the skin, with the head, of the Asseel  Gayal, which is deposited in the Museum of the Hon. East-India Company,  in Leadenhall Street.\" [A drawing was taken of this head, of which the  engraving on the opposite page is a copy.]    \"I may notice another species of Gayal, of which a male and female were  in the Governor General's park, at Barrackpore. This species differs in  some particulars from the domesticated Gayal, and also from the Asseel,  or true Gayal; first, in size, being a larger animal than the domestic  one; secondly, in the largeness of the dewlap, which is deeper and more  undulated than in either the wild or tame species; and, thirdly, in the  size and form of the horns.\"    Thus, according to the opinion of General Hardwicke, there are three  distinct species of the Gayal; but in this matter nothing can be decided  without further evidence, which we hope will soon appear in the shape of  complete skeletons, and accurate drawings and descriptions.    [Illustration]          THE TAME OR DOMESTIC GAYAL.      [Illustration]    The representation of the Gayal here given was taken from a living  specimen in the Zoological Gardens, 1846.    The scanty information I was able to glean concerning it, consists in  its having been procured at Chitagong, and shipped, as a commercial  speculation, from Calcutta for London, in January 1844, when about two  years and a half old. It remained in the Zoological Gardens till the  summer of 1846, when it died from inflammation of the bowels, brought on  chiefly by eating too much green food.    I had the above particulars from Mr. Bartlett, naturalist, &c., who had  been commissioned to dispose of it. He preserved the skeleton, which he  kindly allowed me to examine, and from which I made the sketches of the  skull and horns, which appear on the following page.    The skeleton has fourteen pairs of ribs.    [Illustration: Skull of Domestic Gayal, viewed in front, with Section of  Horn.]                                                      Inches.

[Illustration: Occipital view of the same Skull.]    [Illustration: Head of Domestic Gayal.]    In concluding these details of the Gayal and Gyall, let it be remarked  that, when we hear one animal called Gayal and another Gyall, we are  not, _on that account merely_, to set them down as of the same species.  It is hardly necessary to say, that similarity or even identity of name,  is not the slightest criterion of identity of species. The name Elephant  is popularly applied to that animal, whether brought from Africa or  Asia; they are, nevertheless, anatomically distinct. The same  observation may be made respecting the Lions of those countries, and  various other animals.    It may further be observed, that the value of external characters in  determining a species is very different when applied to ascertain the  distinctions of domestic races, to what it is when applied to ascertain  the distinctions of animals living in a natural state. In domestication,  varieties ramify to an indefinite extent, and under such circumstances  external characters are comparatively valueless. But wild animals retain  their external characters with undeviating exactness; exceptional cases  may indeed occur, but "]]]
