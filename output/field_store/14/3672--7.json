I looked back as I rounded the far  end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together,  and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was our  interview that was the subject of their debate.    \"I wish none of their confidences,\" said Holmes, when I reported to him  what had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House  in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with  a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. \"No  confidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an  arrest for conspiracy and murder.\"    \"You think it will come to that?\"    He was in his most cheerful and debonair humour. \"My dear Watson, when  I have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in touch  with the whole situation. I don't say that we have fathomed it--far from  it--but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell--\"    \"The dumb-bell!\"    \"Dear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact  that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell? Well, well, you need not  be downcast; for between ourselves I don't think that either Inspector  Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming  importance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson! Consider an athlete  with one dumb-bell! Picture to yourself the unilateral development, the  imminent danger of a spinal curvature. Shocking, Watson, shocking!\"    He sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with  mischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. The mere sight of his  excellent appetite was an assurance of success; for I had very clear  recollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his  baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin, eager  features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental  concentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook  of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case,  rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered  statement.    \"A lie, Watson--a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising  lie--that's what meets us on the threshold! There is our starting  point. The whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker's story is  corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are both  lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why are  they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to  conceal? Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie and  reconstruct the truth.    \"How do I know that they are lying? Because it is a clumsy fabrication  which simply could not be true. Consider! According to the story given  to us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been  committed to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the dead  man's finger, to replace the other ring--a thing which he would surely  never have done--and to put that singular card beside his victim. I say  that this was obviously impossible.    \"You may argue--but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson,  to think that you will do so--that the ring may have been taken before  the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short  time shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from  what we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to  give up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of  his giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with  the dead man for some time with the lamp lit. Of that I have no doubt at  all.    \"But the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. Therefore the shot  must have been fired some time earlier than we are told. But there  could be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are in the presence,  therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people  who heard the gunshot--of the man Barker and of the woman Douglas.  When on the top of this I am able to show that the blood mark on the  windowsill was deliberately placed there by Barker, in order to give  a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows dark  against him.    \"Now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did  occur. Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so  it was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to eleven they  had all gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in  the pantry. I have been trying some experiments after you left us this  afternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the  study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut.    \"It is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper's room. It is not so far  down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it was  very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled  when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this  instance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence of the night  it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen's room. She is, as she  has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned in her  evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour  before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was given  would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard was  the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the murder.    \"If this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas,  presuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing  from quarter to eleven, when the sound of the shot brought them down,  until quarter past eleven, when they rang the bell and summoned the  servants. What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give  the alarm? That is the question which faces us, and when it has been  answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem.\"    \"I am convinced myself,\" said I, \"that there is an understanding between  those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at  some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder.\"    \"Exactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what  occurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are  aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are  few wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any man's  spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead body. Should I  ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling  which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my  corpse was lying within a few yards of her. It was badly stage-managed;  for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the absence of the  usual feminine ululation. If there had been nothing else, this incident  alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind.\"    \"You think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty of  the murder?\"    \"There is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,\" said  Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. \"They come at me like bullets. If you  put it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder, and  are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled answer.  I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so clear. Let  us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way.    \"We will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty  love, and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands  between them. It is a large supposition; for discreet inquiry among  servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. On the  contrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very  attached to each other.\"    \"That, I am sure, cannot be true,\" said I, thinking of the beautiful  smiling face in the garden.    \"Well at least they gave that impression. However, we will suppose that  they are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon  this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a man  over whose head some danger hangs--\"    \"We have only their word for that.\"    Holmes looked thoughtful. \"I see, Watson. You are sketching out a theory  by which everything they say from the beginning is false. According  to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret society, or  Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a  good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that brings us to. They  invent this theory to account for the crime. They then play up to the  idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of  some outsider. The stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea. So  does the card on the body, which might have been prepared in the house.  That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But now we come on the  nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won't slip into their places.  Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons--and an American one at that? How  could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to  them? It's a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen did not start out to  inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this,  Watson?\"    \"I confess that I can't explain it.\"    \"Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband,  are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his  wedding ring after his death? Does that strike you as very probable,  Watson?\"    \"No, it does not.\"    \"And once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside  had occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the  dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the  bicycle is the first thing which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#11)"],[1,"of the law.\" Yet once he was roused to action, his great  resources made themselves apparent: a memory amounting to genius, a  boyish delight in the rough-and-tumble of combat, a wealth of passion,  kept in perfect curb till the enemy was already in rout before solid  argument and then let loose with destroying effect. This child of nature  was governed in his practice of the law less by retainers than by his  personal loves and hatreds. Samuel Chase he loved and Thomas Jefferson  he hated, and though his acquaintance with criminals had furnished him  with a vituperative vocabulary of some amplitude, he considered no other  damnation quite so scathing as to call a man \"as great a scoundrel as  Tom Jefferson.\"    The impeachers had no one whom they could pit against this \"unprincipled  and impudent Federalist bulldog,\" as Jefferson called him; and in other  ways, too, from the first their lot was not easy. For one thing, they  could not agree among themselves as to the proper scope of impeachment  under the Constitution. Randolph, the leader of the House managers, and  Campbell adhered in essence to Giles's theory. But Rodney and Nicholson,  both much abler lawyers, openly disavowed such latitudinarian doctrine.  In a general way, their view of the matter may be stated thus: Because  judges of the United States are guaranteed continuance in office only  during \"good behavior,\" and because impeachment is the only method  of removal recognized by the Constitution, the \"high crimes and  misdemeanors\" for which impeachment is the constitutional resource must  include all cases of willful misconduct in office, whether indictable or  not. This seems sound theory and appears today to be established theory.  But sound or not, the managers of the Republicans were not a unit  in urging it, while their opponents put forward with confidence and  unanimity the theory that \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" were always  indictable offenses.    More calamitous still for the accusers of Chase was the way in which,  when the evidence began to come in, the case against him started  crumpling at the corners. Lewis, who had been Fries's attorney and whose  testimony they had chiefly relied upon to prove the judge's unfairness  on that occasion, had not only acknowledged that his memory was \"not  very tenacious\" after so great a lapse of time but had further admitted  that he had really dropped the case because he thought it \"more likely  that the President would pardon him [Fries] after having been convicted  without having counsel than if he had.\" Similarly Hay, whose repeated  efforts to bring the question of the constitutionality of the Sedition  Act before the jury had caused the rupture between court and counsel  in Callender's case, owned that he had entertained \"but little hopes of  doing Callender any good\" but had \"wished to address the public on the  constitutionality of the law.\" Sensations multiplied on every side. A  man named Heath testified that Chase had told the marshal to strike all  Democrats from the panel which was to try Callender; whereupon a second  witness called to confirm this testimony stated facts which showed the  whole story to be a deliberate fabrication. The story that Chase  had attacked the Administration at Baltimore was also substantially  disproved by the managers' own witnesses. But the climax of absurdity  was reached in the fifth and sixth articles of impeachment, which  were based on the assumption that an act of Congress had required  the procedure in Callender's case to be in accordance with the law of  Virginia. In reply to this argument Chase's attorneys quickly pointed  out that the statute relied upon applied only to actions between  citizens of different States!    The final arguments began on the 20th of February. The first speech in  behalf of Chase was delivered by Joseph Hopkinson, a young Philadelphia  attorney, whose effort stirred the admiration of Federalists and  Republicans alike. He dwelt upon \"the infinite importance\" of the  implications of this case for the future of the Republic, contrasted the  frivolity of the charges brought against Chase with the magnitude of the  crimes of which Warren Hastings had been accused, and pointed out that,  whereas in England only two judges had been impeached in half a century,  in America, \"boasting of its superior purity and virtue,\" seven judges  had been prosecuted within two years. More loosely wrought, but not  less effective was Martin's address, the superb climax of a remarkable  forensic career! The accusation against Chase he reduced to a charge of  indecorum, and he was ready to admit that the manner of his friend  \"bore a stronger resemblance to that of Lord Thurlow than of Lord  Chesterfield,\" but, said he, our judges ought not to be \"like the gods  of Epicurus lolling upon their beds of down, equally careless whether  the laws of their country are obeyed or violated, instead of ACTIVELY  discharging their duties.\"    The closing argument, which fell to the managers, was assigned to  Randolph. It was an unmitigated disaster for the cause in behalf of  which it was pronounced. \"I feel perfectly inadequate to the task of  closing this important debate on account of a severe indisposition which  I labor under,\" were Randolph's opening words, but even this  prefatory apology gave little warning of the distressing exhibition  of incompetence which was to follow. \"On the reopening of the court,\"  records John Quincy Adams in his \"Memoirs,\" \"he [Randolph] began a  speech of about two hours and a half, with as little relation to the  subject-matter as possible... without order, connection, or argument;  consisting altogether of the most hackneyed commonplaces of popular  declamation, mingled up with panegyrics and invectives upon persons,  with a few well-expressed ideas, a few striking figures, much distortion  of face and contortion of body, tears, groans and sobs, with occasional  pauses for recollection, and continual complaints of having lost his  notes.\" So ended the ambition of John Randolph of Roanoke to prove  himself another Burke!    But while their frontal assault on the reason of the court was thus  breaking down, the impeachers, led by the President, were attempting  a flank movement on its virtue. They especially distrusted the  \"steadiness\" of certain New England and New York Senators and hoped  to reach the hearts of these gentlemen through Aaron Burr, the  Vice-President. Burr had heretofore found himself vested with the role  of Lucifer in the Republican Paradise. Now he found himself suddenly  basking in a perpetual sunburst of smiles both from the great central  luminary, Jefferson, and his paler satellites, Madison and Gallatin.  Invitations to the President's dinners were soon followed by more  substantial bribes. Burr's step-son became judge of the Superior  Court at New Orleans; his brother-in-law, secretary to the Louisiana  Territory; his intimate friend Wilkinson, its military commandant.  Then Giles, whose view of impeachment left him utterly shameless in the  matter, drew up and circulated in the Senate itself a petition to the  Governor of New Jersey asking him to quash the indictment for murder  which the Bergen County grand jury had found against Burr as a result of  the duel with Hamilton. At the same time, an act was passed giving the  retiring Vice-President the franking privilege for life. In the debate  Senator Wright of Maryland declared that dueling was justified by the  example of David and Goliath and that the bill was opposed \"only because  our David had slain the Goliath of Federalism.\"    Whether Burr made any attempt to render the expected quid pro quo for  these favors does not appear, but at least if he did, his efforts were  fruitless. The vote on the impeachment of Chase was taken on the 1st of  March, and the impeachers were crushingly defeated. On the first article  they could muster only sixteen votes out of thirty-four; on the second,  only ten; on the fifth, none; on the sixth, four. Even on the last  article, where they made their best showing, they were still four votes  short of the required constitutional majority. When the result of the  last ballot was announced, Randolph rushed from the Senate chamber  to the House to introduce a resolution proposing an amendment to the  Constitution, requiring that judges of the United States \"shall be  removed by the President on joint address of both Houses of Congress.\"  At the same time Nicholson moved an amendment providing legislative  recall for Senators. Thus exasperation was vented and no harm done.    Meanwhile word had come from Philadelphia that the impeachment of the  State Supreme Court judges had also failed. Here, even more impressively  than in the case of Chase, had been illustrated that solidarity of Bench  and Bar which has ever since been such an influential factor in American  government. The Pennsylvania judge-breakers, failing to induce a single  reputable member of the Philadelphia bar to aid them, had been obliged  to go to Delaware, whence they procured Caesar A. Rodney, one of the  House managers against Chase. The two impeachments were thus closely  connected and their results were similar. In the first place, it was  determined that impeachment was likely to be, in the petulant language  of Jefferson, \"a farce\" not soon to be used again for partisan  purposes. In the second place, it was probable that henceforth, in the  Commonwealths as well as in the National Government, political power  would be exercised subject to constitutional restraints applied  judicially. In the third place, however, the judges would henceforth  have to be content with the possession of this magnificent prerogative  and dispense with all judicial homilies on \"manners and morals.\" It was  a fair compromise and has on the whole proved a beneficial one.
