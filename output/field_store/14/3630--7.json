The anthers are too widely separated  from the stigma to make self-fertilization likely. Occasionally  one finds the cowslips perforated by clever bumblebees. As only  the females, which are able to sip far deeper cups, are flying  when they bloom, they must be either too mischievous or too lazy  to drain them in the legitimate manner. Butterflies have only to  stand on a flower, not to enter it, in order to sip nectar from  the four glands that secrete it abundantly.      FORGET-ME-NOT; MOUSE-EAR; SCORPION GRASS; SNAKE GRASS; LOVE ME    (Myosotis Palustris)  Borage family    Flowers - Pure blue, pinkish, or white, with yellow eye; flat,  5-lobed, borne in many-flowered, long, often 1-sided racemes.  Calyx 5-cleft; the lobes narrow, spreading, erect, and open in  fruit; 5 stamens inserted on corolla tube; style threadlike;  ovary 4-celled. Stem: Low, branching, leafy, slender, hairy,  partially reclining. Leaves: (Myosotis = mouse-ear) oblong,  alternate, seated on stem, hairy. Fruit: Nutlets, angled and  keeled on inner side.  Preferred Habitat - Escaped from gardens to brooksides, marshes,  and low meadows.  Flowering Season - May-July.  Distribution - Native of Europe and Asia, now rapidly spreading  from Nova Scotia southward to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and  beyond.    How rare a color blue must have been originally among our flora  is evident from the majority of blue and purple flowers that,  although now abundant here and so perfectly at home, are really  quite recent immigrants from Europe and Asia. But our dryer,  hotter climate never brings to the perfection attained in England        \"The sweet forget-me-nots       That grow for happy lovers.\"    Tennyson thus ignores the melancholy association of the flower in  the popular legend which tells how a lover, when trying to gather  some of these blossoms for his sweetheart, fell into a deep pool,  and threw a bunch on the bank, calling out, as he sank forever  from her sight, \"Forget me not.\" Another dismal myth sends its  hero forth seeking hidden treasure caves in a mountain, under the  guidance of a fairy. He fills his pockets with gold, but not  heeding the fairy's warning to \"forget not the best\" - i.e., the  myosotis - he is crushed by the closing together of the mountain.  Happiest of all is the folk-tale of the Persians; as told by  their poet Shiraz: \"It was in the golden morning of the early  world, when an angel sat weeping outside the closed gates of  Paradise. He had fallen from his high estate through loving a  daughter of earth, nor was he permitted to enter again until she  whom he loved had planted the flowers of the forget-me-not in  every corner of the world. He returned to earth and assisted her,  and together they went hand in hand. When their task was ended,  they entered Paradise together, for the fair woman, without  tasting the bitterness of death, became immortal like the angel  whose love her beauty had won when she sat by the river twining  forget-me-nots in her hair.\"    It was the golden ring around the forget-me-not's center that  first led Sprengel to believe the conspicuous markings at the  entrance of many flowers served as pathfinders to insects. This  golden circle also shelters the nectar from rain, and indicates  to the fly or bee just where it must probe between stigma and  anthers to touch them with opposite sides of its tongue. Since it  may probe from any point of the circle, it is quite likely that  the side of the tongue that touched a pollen-laden anther in one  flower will touch the stigma in the next one visited, and so  cross-fertilize it. But forget-me-nots are not wholly dependent  on insects. When these fail, a fully mature flower is still able  to set fertile seed by shedding its own pollen directly on the  stigma.    The SMALLER FORGET-ME-NOT (M. laxa), formerly accounted a mere  variety of palustris, but now defined as a distinct species, is a  native, and therefore may serve to show how its European relative  here will deteriorate in the dryer atmosphere of the New World.  Its tiny turquoise flowers, borne on long stems from a very loose  raceme, gleam above wet, muddy places from Newfoundland and  Eastern Canada to Virginia and Tennessee.    Even smaller still are the blue or white flowers of the FIELD  FORGET-ME-NOT, SCORPION GRASS, or MOUSE-EAR (M. arvenis), whose  stems and leaves are covered with bristly hairs. It blooms from  August to July in dry places, even on hillsides, an unusual  locality in which to find a member of this moisture-loving clan.  All the flowers remain long in bloom, continually forming new  buds on a lengthening stem, and leaving behind little empty green  calices.      VIPER'S BUGLOSS; BLUE-WEED; VIPER'S HERB or GRASS; SNAKE-FLOWER;  BLUE-THISTLE    (Echium vulgare)  Borage family    Flowers - Bright blue, afterward reddish purple, pink in the bud,  numerous, clustered on short, 1-sided, curved spikes rolled up at  first, and straightening out as flowers expand. Calyx deeply  5-cleft; corolla 1 in. long or less, funnel form, the 5 lobes  unequal, acute; 5 stamens inserted on corolla tube, the filaments  spreading below, and united above into slender appendage, the  anthers forming a cone. 1 pistil with 2 stigmas. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2  ft. high; bristly-hairy, erect, spotted. Leaves: Hairy, rough,  oblong to lance-shaped, alternate, seated on stem, except at base  of plant.  Preferred Habitat - Dry fields, waste places; roadsides.  Flowering Season - June-July.  Distribution - New Brunswick to Virginia, westward to Nebraska;  Europe and Asia.    In England, from whose gardens this plant escaped long ago, a war  of extermination that has been waged against the vigorous,  beautiful weed by the farmers has at last driven it to the  extremity of the island, where a few stragglers about Penzance  testify to the vanquishing of what must once have been a mighty  army. From England a few refugees reached here in i683, no one  knows how; but they proved to be the vanguard of an aggressive  and victorious host that quickly overran our open, hospitable  country, as if to give vent to revenge for long years of  persecution at the hands of Europeans. \"It is a fact that all our  more pernicious weeds, like our vermin, are of Old-World origin,\"  says.John Burroughs. \"...Perhaps the most notable thing about  them, when compared with our native species, is their  persistence, not to say pugnacity. They fight for the soil; they  plant colonies here and there, and will not be rooted out. Our  native weeds are for the most part shy and harmless, and retreat  before civilization.... We have hardly a weed we can call our  own.\"    Years ago, when simple folk believed God had marked plants with  some sign to indicate the special use for which each was  intended, they regarded the spotted stem of the bugloss, and its  seeds shaped like a serpent's head, as certain indications that  the herb would cure snake bites. Indeed, the genus takes its name  from Echis, the Greek for viper.    Because it is showy and offers accessible nectar, a great variety  of insects visit the blue-weed; Muller alone observed sixty-seven  species about it. We need no longer wonder at its fertility. Of  the five stamens one remains in the tube, while the other four  project and form a convenient alighting place for visitors, which  necessarily dust their under sides with pollen as they enter; for  the red anthers were already ripe when the flower opened. Then,  however, the short, immature pistil was kept below. After the  stamens have shed their pollen and there can be no longer danger  of self-fertilization, it gradually elongates itself beyond the  point occupied by them, and divides into two little horns whose  stigmatic surfaces an incoming pollen-laden insect cannot well  fail to strike against. Cross-pollination is so thoroughly  secured in this case that the plant has completely lost the power  of fertilizing itself. Unwelcome visitors like ants, which would  pilfer nectar without rendering any useful service in return, are  warded off by the bristly, hairy foliage. Several kinds of female  bees seek the bugloss exclusively for food for their larvae as  well as for themselves, sweeping up the abundant pollen with  their abdominal brushes as they feast without effort.      BLUE VERVAIN; WILD HYSSOP; SIMPLER'S JOY    (Verbena hastala)  Vervain family    Flowers - Very small, purplish blue, in numerous slender, erect,  compact spikes. Calyx 5-toothed; corolla tubular, unequally  5-lobed; 2 pairs of stamens; 1 pistil. Stem: 3 to 7 ft. high,  rough, branched above, leafy, 4-sided. Leaves: Opposite, stemmed,  lance-shaped, saw-edged, rough; lower ones lobed at base.  Preferred Habitat - Moist meadows, roadsides, waste places.  Flowering Season - June-September.  Distribution - United States and Canada in almost every part.    Seeds below, a circle of insignificant purple-blue flowers in the  center, and buds at the top of the vervain's slender spires do  not produce a striking effect, yet this common plant certainly  does not lack beauty. John Burroughs, ever ready to say a kindly,  appreciative word for any weed, speaks of its drooping, knotted  threads, that \"make a pretty etching upon the winter snow.\" Bees,  the vervain's benefactors, are usually seen clinging to the  blooming spikes, and apparently sleep on them. Borrowing the name  of simpler's joy from its European sister, the flower has also  appropriated much of the tradition and folk-lore centered about  that plant which herb-gatherers, or simplers, truly delighted to  see, since none was once more salable.

He  ran her in and out of her hangar as one would a motor-car from its  garage. One day he sailed down the Avenue des Champs Elysees at the  level of the second-and third-story windows of the palaces that line  that stately street. Coming to his own house he descended, made  fast, and went in to _dejeuner_, leaving his aerial cab without. In  the city streets he steered mainly by aid of a guide rope trailing  behind him. With this he turned sharp corners, went round the Arc de  Triomphe, and said: \"I might have guide-roped under it had I thought  myself worthy.\" On occasion he picked up children in the streets and  gave them a ride.    Though before losing his interest in dirigibles Santos-Dumont  carried the number of his construction up to ten, he cannot be said  to have devised any new and useful improvements after his \"No. VI.\"  The largest of his ships was \"No. X.,\" which had a capacity of  eighty thousand cubic feet--about ten times the size of the little  runabout with which he played pranks in Paris streets. In this  balloon he placed partitions to prevent the gas shifting to one part  of the envelope, and to guard against losing it all in the event of  a tear. The same principle was fundamental in Count Zeppelin's  airships. In 1904 he brought a dirigible to the United States  expecting to compete for a prize at the St. Louis Exposition. But  while suffering exasperating delay from the red-tape which  enveloped the exposition authorities, he discovered one morning that  his craft had been mutilated almost beyond repair in its storage  place. In high dudgeon he left at once for Paris. The explanation of  the malicious act has never been made clear, though many Americans  had an uneasy feeling that the gallant and sportsman-like Brazilian  had been badly treated in our land. On his return to Paris he at  once began experimenting with heavier-than-air machines. Of his work  with them we shall give some account later.    Despite his great personal popularity the airship built by  Santos-Dumont never appealed to the French military authorities.  Probably this was largely due to the fact that he never built one of  a sufficient size to meet military tests. The amateur in him was  unconquerable. While von Zeppelin's first ship was big enough to  take the air in actual war the Frenchman went on building craft for  one or two men--good models for others to seize and build upon, but  nothing which a war office could actually adopt. But he served his  country well by stimulating the creation of great companies who  built largely upon the foundations he had laid.    First and greatest of these was the company formed by the Lebaudy  Brothers, wealthy sugar manufacturers. Their model was semi-rigid,  that is, provided with an inflexible keel or floor to the gas bag,  which was cigar shaped. The most successful of the earlier ships was  190 feet long, with a car suspended by cables ten feet below the  balloon and carrying the twin motors, together with passengers and  supplies. Although it made many voyages without accident, it finally  encountered what seems to be the chief peril of dirigible balloons,  being torn from its moorings at Chalons and dashed against trees to  the complete demolition of its envelope. Repaired in eleven weeks  she was taken over by the French Department of War, and was in  active service at the beginning of the war. Her two successors on  the company's building ways were less fortunate. _La Patrie_, after  many successful trips, and manoeuvres with the troops, was  insecurely moored at Verdun, the famous fortress where she was to  have been permanently stationed. Came up a heavy gale. Her anchors  began to drag. The bugles sounded and the soldiers by hundreds  rushed from the fort to aid. Hurled along by the wind she dragged  the soldiers after her. Fearing disaster to the men the commandant  reluctantly ordered them to let go. The ship leaped into the black  upper air and disappeared. All across France, across that very  country where in 1916 the trenches cut their ugly zigzags from the  Channel to the Vosges, she drifted unseen. By morning she was flying  over England and Wales. Ireland caught a glimpse of her and days  thereafter sailors coming into port told of a curious yellow mass,  seemingly flabby and disintegrating like the carcass of a whale,  floating far out at sea.    Her partner ship _La Republique_ had a like tragic end. She too made  many successful trips, and proved her stability and worth. But one  day while manoeuvring near Paris one of her propellers broke and  tore a great rent in her envelope. As the _Titanic_, her hull ripped  open by an iceberg, sunk with more than a thousand of her people, so  this airship, wounded in a more unstable element, fell to the ground  killing all on board.    Two airships were built in France for England in 1909. One, the  _Clement-Bayard II._, was of the rigid type and built for the  government; the other, a _Lebaudy_, was non-rigid and paid for by  popular subscriptions raised in England by the _Morning Post_. Both  were safely delivered near London having made their voyages of  approximately 242 miles each at a speed exceeding forty miles an  hour. These were the first airships acquired for British use.    In the United States the only serious effort to develop the  dirigible prior to the war, and to apply it to some definite  purpose, was made not by the government but by an individual. Mr.  Walter Wellman, a distinguished journalist, fired by the effort of  Andree to reach the North Pole in a drifting balloon, undertook a  similar expedition with a dirigible in 1907. A balloon was built 184  feet in length and 52 feet in diameter, and was driven by a  seventy-to eighty-horse-power motor. A curious feature of this craft  was the guide rope or, as Wellman called it, the equilibrator, which  was made of steel, jointed and hollow. At the lower end were four  steel cylinders carrying wheels and so arranged that they would  float on water or trundle along over the roughest ice. The idea was  that the equilibrator would serve like a guide rope, trailing on the  water or ice when the balloon hung low, and increasing the power of  its drag if the balloon, rising higher, lifted a greater part of its  length into the air. Wellman had every possible appliance to  contribute to the safety of the airship, and many believe that had  fortune favoured him the glory of the discovery of the Pole would  have been his. Unhappily he encountered only ill luck. One season he  spent at Dane's Island, near Spitzenberg whence Andree had set sail,  waiting vainly for favourable weather conditions. The following  summer, just as he was about to start, a fierce storm destroyed his  balloon shed and injured the balloon. Before necessary repairs could  be accomplished Admiral Peary discovered the Pole and the purpose  of the expedition was at an end. Wellman, however, had become deeply  interested in aeronautics and, balked in one ambition, set out to  accomplish another. With the same balloon somewhat remodelled he  tried to cross the Atlantic, setting sail from Atlantic City, N. J.,  October 16, 1911. But the device on which the aeronaut most prided  himself proved his undoing. The equilibrator, relied upon both for  storage room and as a regulator of the altitude of the ship, proved  a fatal attachment. In even moderate weather it bumped over the  waves and racked the structure of the balloon with its savage  tugging until the machinery broke down and the adventurers were at  the mercy of the elements. Luckily for them after they had been  adrift for seventy-two hours, and travelled several hundred miles  they were rescued by the British steamer _Trent_. Not long after  Wellman's chief engineer Vanniman sought to cross the Atlantic in a  similar craft but from some unexplained cause she blew up in mid-air  and all aboard were lost.    Neither Great Britain nor the United States has reason to be proud  of the attitude of its government towards the inventors who were  struggling to subdue the air to the uses of man. Nor has either  reason to boast much of its action in utterly ignoring up to the  very day war broke that aid to military service of which Lord  Kitchener said, \"One aviator is worth a corps of cavalry.\" It will  be noted that to get its first effective dirigible Great Britain had  to rely upon popular subscriptions drummed up by a newspaper. That  was in 1909. To-day, in 1917, the United States has only one  dirigible of a type to be considered effective in the light of  modern standards, though our entrance upon the war has caused the  beginning of a considerable fleet. In aviation no less than in  aerostatics the record of the United States is negligible. Our  country did indeed produce the Wright Brothers, pioneers and true  conquerors of the air with airplanes. But even they were forced to  go to France for support and indeed for respectful attention.    So far as the development of dirigible balloons is concerned there  is no more need to devote space to what was done in England and the  United States than there was for the famous chapter on Snakes in  Iceland.          CHAPTER IV    THE COUNT VON ZEPPELIN      The year that witnessed the first triumphs of Santos-Dumont saw also  the beginning of the success of his great German rival, the Count  von Zeppelin. These two daring spirits, struggling to attain the  same end, were alike in their enthusiasm, their pertinacity, and  their devotion to the same cause. Both were animated by the highest  patriotism. Santos-Dumont offered his fleet to France to be used  against any nation except those of the two Americas. He said: \"It is  in France that I have met with all my encouragement; in France and  with French material I have made all my experiments. I excepted the  two Americas because I am an American.\"    Count Zeppelin for his part, when bowed down in apparent defeat and  crushed"]]]
