The varieties of  the ground colour or tint on which these markings or spots are placed  constitutes the name, such as black-spotted tabby, brown-spotted tabby,  and so on, the red-spotted tabby or yellow-spotted tabby in _she_-cats  being by far the most scarce. These should be marked with _spots_  instead of _bands_, on the same ground colour as the red or  yellow-banded tabby cat. In the former the ground colour should be a  rich red, with spots of a deep, almost chocolate colour, while that of  the yellow tabby may be a deep yellow cream, with yellowish-brown spots.  Both are very scarce, and are extremely pretty. Any admixture of white  is not allowable in the class for yellow or red tabbies; such exhibit  must be put into the class (should there be one, which is usually the  case at large shows) for red or yellow and _white_ tabbies. This  exhibitors will do well to make a note of.    There is a rich-coloured brown tabby hybrid to be seen at the Zoological  Society Gardens in Regent's Park, between the wild cat of Bengal and a  tabby she-cat. It is handsome, but very wild. These hybrids, I am told,  will breed again with tame variety, or with others.    [Illustration]    In the brown-spotted tabby, the dark gray-spotted tabby, the  black-spotted tabby, the gray or the blue-spotted tabby, the eyes are  best yellow or orange tinted, with the less of the green the better. The  nose should be of a dark red, edged with black or dark brown, in the  dark colours, or somewhat lighter colour in the gray or blue tabbies.  The pads of the feet in all instances must be black. In the yellow and  the red tabby the nose and the pads of the feet are to be pink. As  regards the tail, that should have large spots on the upper and lower  sides instead of being annulated, but this is difficult to obtain. It  has always occurred to me that the spotted tabby is a much nearer  approach to the wild English cat and some other wild cats in the way of  colour than the ordinary broad-banded tabby. Those specimens of the  crosses, said to be between the wild and domestic cat, that I have seen,  have had a tendency to be spotted tabbies. And these crosses were not  infrequent in bygone times when the wild cats were more numerous than  at present, as is stated to be the case by that reliable authority,  Thomas Bewick. In the year 1873, there was a specimen shown at the  Crystal Palace Cat Show, and also the last year or two there has been  exhibited at the same place a most beautiful hybrid between the East  Indian wild cat and the domestic cat. It was shown in the spotted tabby  class, and won the first prize. The ground colour was a deep  blackish-brown, with well-defined black spots, black pads to the feet,  rich in colour, and very strong and powerfully made, and not by any  means a sweet temper. It was a he-cat, and though I have made inquiry, I  have not been able to ascertain that any progeny has been reared from  it, yet I have been informed that such hybrids between the Indian wild  cat and the domestic cat breed freely.    [Illustration]          THE ABYSSINIAN.      I now come to the last variety of the tabby cat, and this can scarcely  be called a tabby proper, as it is nearly destitute of markings,  excepting sometimes on the legs and a broad black band along the back.  It is mostly of a deep brown, ticked with black, somewhat resembling the  back of a wild (only not so gray) rabbit. Along the centre of the back,  from the nape of the neck to the tip of the tail, there is a band of  black, very slightly interspersed with dark brown hairs. The inner sides  of the legs and belly are more of a rufous-orange tint than the body,  and are marked in some cases with a few dark patches; but they are best  without these marks, and in the exhibition pens it is a point lost. The  eyes are deep yellow, tinted with green; nose dark red, black-edged;  ears rather small, dark brown, with black edges and tips; the pads of  the feet are black. Altogether, it is a pretty and interesting variety.  It has been shown under a variety of names, such as Russian, Spanish,  Abyssinian, Hare cat, Rabbit cat, and some have gone so far as to  maintain that it is a cross between the latter and a cat, proving very  unmistakably there is nothing, however absurd or impossible, in animal  or everyday life, that some people are not ready to credit and believe.  A hybrid between the English wild cat and the domestic much resembles  it; and I do not consider it different in any way, with the exception of  its colour, from the ordinary tabby cat, from which I have seen kittens  and adults bearing almost the same appearance. Some years ago when out  rabbit-shooting on the South Downs, not far from Eastbourne, one of our  party shot a cat of this colour in a copse not far from the village of  Eastdean. He mistook it at first for a rabbit as it dashed into the  underwood. It proved not to be wild, but belonged to one of the  villagers, and was bred in the village. When the ground colour is light  gray or blue, it is generally called chinchilla, to the fur of which  animal the coat has a general resemblance. I have but little inclination  to place it as a distinct, though often it is of foreign breed; such may  be, though ours is merely a variety--and a very interesting one--of the  ordinary tabby, with which its form, habits, temper, etc., seem fully to  correspond; still several have been imported from Abyssinia all of which  were precisely similar, and it is stated that this is the origin of the  Egyptian cat that was worshipped so many centuries ago. The mummies of  the cats I have seen in no case had any hair left, so that it was  impossible to determine what colour they were. The imported cats are of  stouter build than the English and less marked. These bred with an  English tabby often give a result of nearly black, the back band  extending very much down the sides, and the brown ticks almost  disappearing, producing a rich and beautiful colouring.    I find there is yet another tint or colour of the tabby proper which I  have not mentioned, that is to say, a cat marked with light wavy lines,  and an exceedingly pretty one it is. It is very rare; in fact, so much  so that it has never had a class appropriated to it, and therefore is  only admissible to or likely to win in the class \"For Any Other Colour,\"  in which class usually a number of very beautiful varieties are to be  found, some of which I shall have occasion to notice further on. The  colour, however, that I now refer to is often called the silver tabby,  for want of a better name. It is this. The whole of the ground colour is  of a most delicate silver-gray, clear and firm in tone, slightly blue if  anything apart from the gray, and the markings thereon are but a little  darker, with a tinge of lilac in them making the fur to look like an  evening sky, rayed with light clouds. The eyes are orange-yellow, and  when large and full make a fine contrast to the colour of the fur. The  nose is red, edged with a lilac tint, and the pads of the feet and  claws are black, or nearly so. The hair is generally very fine, short,  and soft. Altogether it is most lovely, and well worthy of attention,  forming, as it does, a beautiful contrast to the red, the yellow, or  even the brown tabby. A turquoise ribbon about its neck will show to  great advantage the delicate lilac tints of its coat, or, if a contrast  is preferred, a light orange scarlet, or what is often called geranium  colour, will perhaps give a brighter and more pleasing effect.    [Illustration: MRS. HERRING'S BLUE SMALL-BANDED TABBY.]    This is by no means so uncommon a colour in the _long-haired_ cats,  some of which are exquisite, and are certainly the acme of beauty in the  way of cat colouring; but I must here remark that there is a vast  difference in the way of disposition between these two light varieties,  that of the former being far more gentle. In fact, I am of opinion that  the short-haired cat in general is of a more genial temperament, more  \"cossetty,\" more observant, more quick in adapting itself to its  surroundings and circumstances than its long-haired brother, and, as a  rule, it is also more cleanly in its habits. Though at the same time I  am willing to admit that some of these peculiarities being set aside,  the long-haired cat is charmingly beautiful, and at the same time has a  large degree of intelligence--in fact, much more than most animals that  I know, not even setting aside the dog, and I have come to this  conclusion after much long, careful, and mature consideration.    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          THE SHORT-HAIRED WHITE CAT.      This of all, as it depends entirely on its comeliness, should be  graceful and elegant in the outline of its form and also action, the  head small, not too round nor thick, for this gives a clumsy, heavy  appearance, but broad on the forehead, and gently tapering towards the  muzzle, the nose small, tip even and pink, the ears rather small than  large, and not too pointed, the neck slender, shoulders narrow and  sloping backwards, loin full and long, legs of moderate length, tail  well set on, long, broad at the base, and gradually tapering towards the  end; the white should be the yellow-white, that is, the white of the  colours, such as tortoiseshell, red tabby or blues, not the gray-white  bred from the black, as these are coarser in the quality of the furs.  The eye should be large, round, full, and blue. I noted this peculiarity  of white when breeding white Cochins many years ago; those chickens that  were black when hatched were a colder and harder white than"]]]
