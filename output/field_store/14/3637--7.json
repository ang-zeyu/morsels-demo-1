So soon as John Quincy Adams faced the new spirit in  Congress, he was convinced that it meant probable war. As early as  May, 1836, he warned the South, saying: \"From the instant that your  slaveholding States become the theater of war, civil, servile, or  foreign, from that moment the war powers of the Constitution extend  to interference with the institution of slavery.\" This sentiment he  reiterated and amplified on various occasions. The South was duly  warned that an attempt to disrupt the Union would involve a war of which  emancipation would be one of the consequences. With the exception  of Garrison and a few of his personal followers, abolitionists were  unionists: they stood for the perpetual union of the States.    This is not the place to give an extended account of the Mexican War. *  There are, however, certain incidents connected with the annexation  of Texas and the resulting war which profoundly affected the crusade  against slavery. Both Lundy and Birney in their missions to promote  emancipation through the process of colonization believed that they had  unearthed a plan on the part of Southern leaders to acquire territory  from Mexico for the purpose of extending slavery. This discovery  coincided with the suppression of abolition propaganda in the South.  Hitherto John Quincy Adams had favored the western expansion of our  territory. He had labored diligently to make the Rio Grande the western  boundary of the Louisiana Purchase at the time of the treaty with Spain  in 1819. But though in 1825 he had supported a measure to purchase Texas  from Mexico, under the new conditions he threw himself heartily against  the annexation of Texas, and in 1838 he defeated in the House of  Representatives a resolution favoring annexation. To this end Adams  occupied the morning hour of the House each day from the 16th of June to  the 7th of July, within two days of the time fixed for adjournment.  This was only a beginning of his fight against the extension of slavery.  There was no relenting in his opposition to pro-slavery demands until he  was stricken down with paralysis in the streets of Boston, in November,  1846. He never again addressed a public assembly. But he continued to  occupy his seat in Congress until February 23, 1848.         * See \"Texas and the Mexican War\" (in \"The Chronicles of       America\").    The debate inaugurated in Congress by Adams and others over the  extension of slave territory rapidly spread to the country at large,  and interest in the question became general. Abolitionists were thereby  greatly stimulated to put into practice their professed duty of seeking  to accomplish their ends by political action. Their first effort was  to secure recognition in the regular parties. The Democrats answered  in their platform of 1840 by a plank specifically denouncing the  abolitionists, and the Whigs proved either noncommittal or unfriendly.  The result was that abolitionists organized a party of their own in  1840 and nominated James G. Birney for the Presidency. Both of the  older parties during this campaign evaded the issue of the annexation of  Texas. In 1844 the Whigs again refrained from giving in their platform  any official utterance on the Texas issue, though they were understood  to be opposed to annexation. The Democrats adroitly asserted in their  platform their approval of the re-annexation of Texas and reoccupation  of Oregon. There was a shadowy prior claim to both these regions, and  by combining them in this way the party avoided any odious partiality  towards the acquisition of slave territory. But the voters in both  parties had become interested in the specific question whether the  country was to enter upon a war of conquest whose primary object should  be the extension of slavery. In the North it became generally understood  that a vote for Henry Clay, the Whig candidate, was an expression of  opposition to annexation. This issue, however, was not made clear in the  South. In the absence of telegraph and daily paper it was quite possible  to maintain contradictory positions in different sections of the  country. But since the Democrats everywhere openly favored annexation,  the election of their candidate, James K. Polk, was generally accepted  as a popular approval of the annexation of Texas. Indeed, action  immediately followed the election and, before the President-elect had  been inaugurated, the joint resolution for the annexation of Texas  passed both Houses of Congress.    The popular vote was almost equally divided between Whigs and Democrats.  Had the vote for Birney, who was again the candidate of the Liberty  party, been cast for Clay electors, Clay would have been chosen  President. The Birney vote was over sixty-two thousand. The Liberty  party, therefore, held the balance of power and determined the result of  the election.    The Liberty party has often been censured for defeating the Whigs  at this election of 1844. But many incidents, too early forgotten by  historians, go far to justify the course of the leaders. Birney and Clay  were at one time members of the same party. They were personal friends,  and as slave holders they shared the view that slavery was a menace to  the country and ought to be abolished. It was just fourteen years before  this election that Birney made a visit to Clay to induce him to accept  the leadership of an organized movement to abolish slavery in Kentucky.  Three years later, when Birney returned to Kentucky to do himself what  Henry Clay had refused to do, he became convinced that the reaction  which had taken place in favor of slavery was largely due to Clay's  influence. This was a common impression among active abolitionists.  It is not strange, therefore, that they refused to support him as a  candidate for the Presidency, and it is not at all certain that his  election in 1844 would have prevented the war with Mexico.    Northern Whigs accused the Democrats of fomenting a war with Mexico with  the intention of gaining territory for the purpose of extending slavery.  Democrats denied that the annexation of Texas would lead to war, and  many of them proclaimed their opposition to the farther extension of  slavery. In harmony with this sentiment, when President Polk asked for a  grant of two million dollars to aid in making a treaty with Mexico, they  attached to the bill granting the amount a proviso to the effect that  slavery should forever be prohibited in any territory which might be  obtained from Mexico by the contemplated treaty. The proviso was written  by an Ohio Democrat and was introduced in the House by David A. Wilmot,  a Pennsylvania Democrat, after whom it is known. It passed the House  by a fair majority with the support of both Whigs and Democrats. At the  time of the original introduction in August, 1846, the Senate did not  vote upon the measure. Davis of Massachusetts moved its adoption but  inadvertently prolonged his speech in its favor until the hour for  adjournment. Hence there was no vote on the subject. Subsequently the  proviso in a new form again passed the House but failed of adoption in  the Senate.    During the war the Wilmot Proviso was the subject of frequent debate  in Congress and of continuous debate throughout the country until  the treaty with Mexico was signed in 1848. A vast territory had been  acquired as a result of the war, and no decision had been reached as  to whether it should remain free or be opened to settlement by  slave-owners. Another presidential election was at hand. For fully ten  years there had been ever-increasing excitement over the question of  the limitation or the extension of slavery. This had clearly become  the topic of supreme interest throughout the country, and yet the two  leading parties avoided the issue. Their own membership was divided.  Northern Democrats, many of them, were decidedly opposed to slavery  extension. Southern Whigs with equal intensity favored the extension of  slavery into the new territory. The platforms of the two parties were  silent on the subject. The Whigs nominated Taylor, a Southern general  who had never voted their party ticket, but they made no formal  declaration of principles. The Democrats repeated with colorless  additions their platforms of 1840 anti 1844 and sought to win the  election with a Northern man, Lewis Cass of Michigan, as candidate.    There was, therefore, a clear field for a party having fully defined  views to express on a topic of commanding interest. The cleavage in the  Democratic party already begun by the debate over the Wilmot Proviso was  farther promoted by a factional division of New York Democrats. Martin  Van Buren became the leader of the liberal faction, the \"Barnburners,\"  who nominated him for President at a convention at Utica. The spirit of  independence now seized disaffected Whigs and Democrats everywhere  in the North and Northwest. Men of anti-slavery proclivities held  nonpartizan meetings and conventions. The movement finally culminated  in the famous Buffalo convention which gave birth to the Freesoil party.  The delegates of all political persuasions united on the one principle  of opposition to slavery. They adopted a ringing platform closing with  the words: \"Resolved, That we inscribe on our banner 'Free Soil, Free  Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men,' and under it will fight on, and  fight ever, until a triumphant victory shall reward our exertions.\" They  accepted Van Buren as their candidate. The vote at the ensuing election  was more than fourfold that given to Birney in 1844. The Van Buren  supporters held the balance of power between Whigs and Democrats in  twelve States. Taylor was elected by the vote of New York, which except  for the division in the party would have gone to Cass.

An actor, named  Priest, was playing at one of the principal theatres. Some one remarked  at the Garrick Club, that there were a great many men in the pit.  \"Probably, clerks who have taken Priest's orders.\" The pun is perfect,  but the real proprietor is Mr. Poole, one of the best punsters as well  as one of the cleverest comic writers and finest satirists of the day.  It has also been attributed to Charles Lamb.    Formerly, it was customary, on emergencies, for the judges to swear  affidavits at their dwelling-houses. Smith was desired by his father to  attend a judge's chambers for that purpose, but being engaged to dine in  Russell-square, at the next house to Mr. Justice Holroyd's, he thought  he might as well save himself the disagreeable necessity of leaving the  party at eight by dispatching his business at once: so, a few minutes  before six, he boldly knocked at the judge's, and requested to speak  to him on particular business. The judge was at dinner, but came down  without delay, swore the affidavit, and then gravely asked what was the  pressing necessity that induced our friend to disturb him at that hour.  As Smith told the story, he raked his invention for a lie, but finding  none fit for the purpose, he blurted out the truth:--        \"'The fact is, my lord, I am engaged to dine at the next        house--and--and----'        \"'And, sir, you thought you might as well save your own dinner by        spoiling mine?'        \"'Exactly so, my lord, but----'        \"'Sir, I wish you a good evening.'\"    Smith was rather fond of a joke on his own branch of the profession;  he always gave a peculiar emphasis to the line in his song on the  contradiction of names:     \"Mr. Makepeace was bred an attorney;\"    and would frequently quote Goldsmith's lines on Hickey, the associate  of Burke and other distinguished cotemporaries:     \"He cherished his friend, and he relished a bumper;    Yet one fault he had, and that was a thumper,    Then, what was his failing? come, tell it, and burn ye:    He was, could he help it? a special attorney.\"    The following playful colloquy in verse took place at a dinner-table  between Sir George Rose and himself, in allusion to Craven-street,  Strand, where he resided:--     \"_J. S._--'At the top of my street the attorneys abound.       And down at the bottom the barges are found:     Fly, Honesty, fly to some safer retreat,       For there's craft in the river, and craft in the street.'\"      \"_Sir G. R._--'Why should Honesty fly to some safer retreat,       From attorneys and barges, od rot 'em?      For the lawyers are _just_ at the top of the street,       And the barges are _just_ at the bottom.'\"           *       *       *       *       *      CONTEMPORARY COPYRIGHTS.    The late Mr. Tegg, the publisher in Cheapside, gave the following list  of remunerative payments to distinguished authors in his time; and he is  believed to have taken considerable pains to verify the items:    Fragments of History, by Charles Fox, sold by Lord Holland, for 5000  guineas. Fragments of History, by Sir James Mackintosh, 500_l._  Lingard's History of England, 4683_l._ Sir Walter Scott's Bonaparte was  sold, with the printed books, for 18,000_l._; the net receipts of  copyright on the first two editions only must have been 10,000_l._ Life  of Wilberforce, by his sons, 4000 guineas. Life of Byron, by Moore,  4000_l._ Life of Sheridan, by Moore, 2000_l._ Life of Hannah More,  2000_l._ Life of Cowper, by Southey, 1000_l._ Life and Times of George  IV., by Lady C.

The year of Miss Burney's birth was long  involved in studied obscurity, and thus the deception lasted, until  one fine day it was ascertained, by reference to the register of the  authoress' birth, that she was a woman of six or seven-and-twenty,  instead of a \"Miss in her teens,\" when she wrote _Evelina_. The story  of her father's utter ignorance of the work being written by her, and  recommending her to read it, as an exception to the novel class, has  also been essentially modified. Miss Burney, (then Madame D'Arblay,) is  said to have taken the characters in her novel of _Camilla_ from the  family of Mr. Lock, of Norbury Park, who built for Gen. D'Arblay the  villa in which the work was written, and which to this day is called  \"Camilla Lacy.\" By this novel, Madame D'Arblay is said to have realized  3000 guineas.           *       *       *       *       *      EPITAPH ON CHARLES LAMB.    Lamb lies buried in Edmonton churchyard, and the stone bears the  following lines to his memory, written by his friend, the Rev. H. F.  Cary, the erudite translator of _Dante_ and _Pindar_:--     \"Farewell, dear friend!--that smile, that harmless mirth,    No more shall gladden our domestic hearth;    That rising tear, with pain forbid to flow--    Better than words--no more assuage our woe.    That hand outstretch'd from small but well-earned store    Yield succour to the destitute no more.    Yet art thou not all lost: through many an age,    With sterling sense and humour, shall thy page    Win many an English bosom, pleased to see    That old and happier vein revived in thee.    This for our earth; and if with friends we share    Our joys in heaven, we hope to meet thee there.\"    Lamb survived his earliest friend and school-fellow, Coleridge, only a  few months. One morning he showed to a friend the mourning ring which  the author of _Christabelle_ had left him. \"Poor fellow!\" exclaimed  Lamb, \"I have never ceased to think of him from the day I first heard of  his death.\" Lamb died in _five days after_--December 27, 1834, in his  fifty-ninth year.           *       *       *       *       *      \"TOM CRINGLE'S LOG.\"    The author of this very successful work, (originally published in  _Blackwood's Magazine_,) was a Mr. Mick Scott, born in Edinburgh in  1789, and educated at the High School. Several years of his life were  spent in the West Indies. He ultimately married, returned to his native  country, and there embarked in commercial speculations, in the leisure  between which he wrote the _Log_. Notwithstanding its popularity in  Europe and America, the author preserved his incognito to the last. He  survived his publisher for some years, and it was not till Mr. Scott's  death that the sons of Mr. Blackwood were aware of his name.           *       *       *       *       *      CHANCES FOR THE DRAMA.    The royal patent, by which the performance of the regular drama was  restricted to certain theatres, does not appear to have fostered this  class of writing. Dr. Johnson forced Goldsmith's _She Stoops to Conquer_  into the theatre. Tobin died regretting that he could not succeed in  hearing the _Honeymoon_ performed. Lillo produced _George Barnwell_  (an admirably written play) at an irregular theatre, after it had been  rejected by the holders of the patents. _Douglas_ was cast on Home's  hands. Fielding was introduced as a dramatist at an unlicensed house;  and one of Mrs. Inchbald's popular comedies had lain two years  neglected, when, by a trifling accident, she was able to obtain the  manager's _approval_.           *       *       *       *       *      FULLER'S MEMORY.    Marvellous anecdotes are related of Dr. Thomas Fuller's memory. Thus, it  is stated that he undertook once, in passing to and from Temple Bar to  the farthest conduit in Cheapside, to tell at his return every sign as  they stood in order on both sides of the way, repeating them either  backward or forward. This must have been a great feat, seeing that every  house then bore a sign. Yet, Fuller himself decried this kind of thing  as a trick, no art. He relates that one (who since wrote a book thereof)  told him, before credible people, that he, in Sidney College, had taught  him (Fuller) the art of memory. Fuller replied that it was not so, for  _he could not remember that he had ever seen him before;_ \"which, I  conceive,\" adds Fuller, \"was a real refutation;\" and we think so, too.           *       *       *       *       *      LORD HERVEY'S WIT.    Horace Walpole records Lord Hervey's memorable saying about Lord  Burlington's pretty villa at Chiswick, now the Duke of Devonshire's,  that it was \"too small to inhabit, and too large to hang to your watch;\"  and Lady Louisa Stuart has preserved a piece of dandyism in eating, which  even Beau Brummell might have envied--\"When asked at dinner whether he  would have some beef, he answered, 'Beef? oh, no! faugh! don't you know  I never eat beef, nor horse, nor any of those things?'\"--The man that  said these things was the successful lover of the prettiest maid of  honour to the Princess of Wales--the person held up to everlasting  ridicule by Pope--the vice-chamberlain whose attractions engaged the  affections of the daughter of the Sovereign he served; and the peer  whose wit was such that it \"charmed the charming Mary Montague.\"           *       *       *       *       *      ANACREONTIC"]]]
