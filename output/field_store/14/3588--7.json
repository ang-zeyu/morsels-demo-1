What  further harm the young Lord Guilford Dudley could do is not apparent.  Even then the Queen's advisers shrank from exhibiting on Tower Hill the  spectacle of a young and beautiful girl, taken forth to be beheaded  because certain hot-headed partizans had used her name. She was executed  therefore within the verge of the Tower itself, on the so-called  'Green.'    'The Green' is a place where no grass will grow--it used to be said--on  account of the blood that had been shed upon it. Among the sufferers  here was Hastings, executed by order of King Richard: Anne Boleyn:  Katharine Howard: and Lady Jane Grey. A stone marks the spot on which  the scaffold was set up.    It was on the morning of the 12th of February that Lady Jane Grey was  put to death. She was then confined in the 'Brick' Tower, the residence  of the Master of the Ordnance. From her window she saw the headless body  of her husband brought back from Tower Hill in a cart. She looked upon  it without shrinking. 'Oh! Guilford,' she said, 'the antipast is not so  bitter after thou hast tasted, and which I shall soon taste, as to make  my flesh tremble: it is nothing compared to the feast of which we shall  partake this day in Heaven.' So she went forth with her two gentlewomen,  Elizabeth Tylney and Mistress Helen, but she shed no tears. When she was  on the scaffold she spoke to the officers of the Tower and the soldiers  that stood around. No man or woman, however wise and dignified, could  speak more clearly and with greater dignity than this girl of sixteen.  They had been trying to make her a Catholic. Therefore, she made  confession of the Protestant Faith: 'Good Christian people, bear witness  that I die a true Christian woman and that I do look to be saved by no  other means but only by the mercy of God, in the blood of his only son,  Jesus Christ.'    So she made her gentlewomen bare her neck and bind her eyes and kneeling  down laid her head upon the block, and while she was saying, 'Lord, into  Thy hands I commend my spirit,' the axe fell and she was dead.    She lies buried before the altar of St. Peter's Church, near the bodies  of the Queens Anne Boleyn and Katharine Howard.    So she died, this poor innocent child of whom all we know is that she  was so scholarly that she could read Greek in the original: that she  was beautiful: of a grave and sweet disposition: and raised far above  the voice of calumny. She had, says Foxe, 'the innocency of childhood,  the beauty of youth, the gravity of age: she had the birth of a  princess, the learning of a clerk, the life of a saint, and the death of  a malefactor for her parents' offences.'    [Illustration: A BED IN THE REIGN OF HENRY III.]          19. THE PILGRIMS.      In the time when the road connecting village with village and town with  town was but an uncertain bridle path through woods and over waste  places, where in winter horse, man, and wayfarer struggled with bog and  quagmire, where robbers lurked in the thickets, and fevers and agues  haunted the marsh, where men went armed and every stranger was a foe: it  would seem as if most men stayed where they were born and desired not to  court the dangers of the unknown world. In many villages, especially in  the remote places of the country, this was the case. The men of Somerset  abode where they were born, speaking their own language, a race apart:  the men of Norfolk abode in their county cut off from the rest of the  world by fens in the west and sea on the north and east: their language  was not understood by the men of the west or the south country. Had the  other conditions of life allowed this isolation to continue  undisturbed, the nation could never have been created: we should have  remained a scattered collection of tribes speaking each its own language  and developing its own customs.    There were three causes which stirred the stagnant waters. The first was  War. The Baron, or Feudal Lord, carried off the young men of the village  to fight: those of them who returned had things to tell of the outside  world. They fired the imagination and awakened the enterprise of the  lads. The second was Trade at the trading ports: the lads saw, and  continued to talk with, the foreign sailors--the Fleming, the German,  the man of Rouen or Bordeaux: some of them went on board the ships of  the merchant adventurers and sailed to foreign lands. Lastly, there were  the Pilgrimages.    From the tenth to the fifteenth century there was a rage for pilgrimage.  Everybody wanted to become a pilgrim. No money was wanted: there would  certainly be found every day some monastery at which bed and a supper  would be provided for the pilgrim: it was a joyous company which fared  along the road, some riding, some on foot, travelling together for  safety, all bound to the same shrine where they would hear the masses  and make their vows and so return, light-hearted: it was, in fact, the  mediaeval way of taking a holiday. Sometimes it was to Canterbury, where  was the shrine of Thomas Becket, that the pilgrims were bound: sometimes  to Walsingham, where was the miraculous image of the Virgin: sometimes  to Glastonbury, hallowed by the thorn miraculously flowering every year  on Christmas Day, planted by Joseph of Arimathea himself: sometimes it  was farther afield--to Compostella in Spain, Rome, or even  Jerusalem--that the pilgrims proposed to go. Chaucer describes such a  company all starting together, riding from London to Canterbury on  pilgrimage to the shrine of Thomas Becket. They are pilgrims, but there  is very little piety in their discourse: one can see that, whatever the  motive, whether for the expiation of sin, or any other cause, the  journey is full of cheerfulness and enjoyment. The Crusades were one  outcome of this passion for pilgrimage. Nay, the first Crusade itself  was little better than a great pilgrimage of the common people, so  ignorant that they asked at the sight of every walled town if that was  Jerusalem. It was a pilgrimage from which few, indeed, returned.    In England, the chief gain from pilgrimage was the bringing together of  men from the different parts of the country. Remember that the men of  the North could not understand the speech of the men of the South: a  Norfolk rustic at the present day would hardly understand a man of  Devon: there was always danger of forgetting that they all belonged to  the same realm, the same nation, and the same race.    But the love of pilgrimage spread so wide that it became a danger. The  rustic left the plough: the blacksmith his anvil: the carpenter his  bench: all left their wives and their children in order to tramp across  the country on pilgrimage to some shrine. By day they marched together:  at night they sat round the fire in the strangers' room of the  monastery, and took their supper and slept on the reeds. A delightful  change from the monotony and hard work of the village! But the Bishops  interposed. Let no one go on pilgrimage without his Bishop's license.  Let not the monasteries give a bed and supper to any pilgrim who could  not show his Bishop's license. Then the rustics and the craftsmen had to  remain at home where they have stayed, except when they went out to  fight, ever since.    When the pilgrim--especially the pilgrim who had been over the  seas--came home, he was able to entertain his friends with stories he  had seen all the rest of his life. Thus, the earliest plan of the Holy  Sepulchre is one drawn by a pilgrim for the instruction of certain monks  who entertained him. The pilgrims were the travellers of the time. They  observed foreign manners and customs: they brought home seeds and told  of strange food: they extended the boundaries of the world: they  prevented the native village from becoming the whole world: they taught  and encouraged men to cease from regarding a stranger as an enemy. The  world was thus opened out by War, Trade, and Pilgrimage, but most of all  by Pilgrimage.          20. ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL.      The oldest of the City Hospitals is that great and splendid Foundation  which stands in Smithfield--the Smooth Field. It was first founded by  one Rahere, of whom we know little or nothing except that he lived in  the reign of Henry I., and that he founded the Priory and Monastery of  St. Bartholomew. In the church of St. Bartholomew the Great you may see  a very beautiful tomb said to be his, but the work is of a later date.  It is related that while on a pilgrimage to Rome he fell ill and was  like to die. And he vowed that if he were restored to health he would  erect and establish a hospital for poor sick people. He did recover and  he fulfilled his vow. He built the Priory of St. Bartholomew, whose  church still stands in part and beside it established his hospital. The  place called Smithfield was then a swampy field used for a horse fair:  it was also a place of execution without the City wall. At first the  hospital was a very small place. It consisted probably of two large  rooms or halls, one for men and one for women--with a chapel. If it had  any endowment at all it must have been very small, because the Master or  Hospitaller had to go every morning to the Shambles, Newgate, in order  to beg meat for the maintenance of the sick. Two hundred years later the  hospital was taken in hand by Edward IV. and provided with an  establishment of Master, eight brethren, priests, and four sisters, who  served the sick. They were all subject to the Rule of St. Austin. After  the death of Whittington, the hospital buildings were repaired by his  bequests. On the dissolution of the religious houses, the Priory and  Hospital of Bartholomew fell with the rest, but five years later the  hospital was refounded and endowed by the King and the City.
