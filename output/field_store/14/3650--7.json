To  show that _the mode of philosophy among the ancients was a certain  laconic diction_.\"[29]    The \"laconisms\" of the Lacedaemonians evidently partook of the proverbial  style: they were, no doubt, often proverbs themselves. The very  instances which Plato supplies of this \"laconising\" are two most  venerable proverbs.    All this elevates the science of PROVERBS, and indicates that these  abridgments of knowledge convey great results, with a parsimony of words  prodigal of sense. They have, therefore, preserved many \"a short  sentence, NOT repeated by the people.\"    It is evident, however, that the earliest writings of every people are  marked by their most homely, or domestic proverbs; for these were more  directly addressed to their wants. Franklin, who may be considered as  the founder of a people who were suddenly placed in a stage of civil  society which as yet could afford no literature, discovered the  philosophical cast of his genius, when he filled his almanacs with  proverbs, by the ingenious contrivance of framing them into a connected  discourse, delivered by an old man attending an auction. \"These  proverbs,\" he tells us, \"which contained the wisdom of many ages and  nations, when their scattered counsels were brought together, made a  great impression. They were reprinted in Britain, in a large sheet of  paper, and stuck up in houses: and were twice translated in France, and  distributed among their poor parishioners.\" The same occurrence had  happened with us ere we became a reading people. Sir Thomas Elyot, in  the reign of Henry the Eighth, describing the ornaments of a nobleman's  house, among his hangings, and plate, and pictures, notices the  engraving of proverbs \"on his plate and vessels, which served the guests  with a most opportune counsel and comments.\" Later even than the reign  of Elizabeth our ancestors had proverbs always before them, on  everything that had room for a piece of advice on it; they had them  painted in their tapestries, stamped on the most ordinary utensils, on  the blades of their knives,[30] the borders of their plates,[31] and  \"conned them out of goldsmiths' rings.\"[32] The usurer, in Robert  Greene's \"Groat's worth of Wit,\" compressed all his philosophy into the  circle of his ring, having learned sufficient Latin to understand the  proverbial motto of \"Tu tibi cura!\" The husband was reminded of his  lordly authority when he only looked into his trencher, one of its  learned aphorisms having descended to us,--      The calmest husbands make the stormiest wives.    The English proverbs of the populace, most of which are still in  circulation, were collected by old John Heywood.[33] They are arranged by  Tusser for \"the parlour--the guest's chamber--the hall--table-lessons,\"  &c. Not a small portion of our ancient proverbs were adapted to rural  life, when our ancestors lived more than ourselves amidst the works of  God, and less among those of men.[34] At this time, one of our old  statesmen, in commending the art of compressing a tedious discourse into  a few significant phrases, suggested the use of proverbs in diplomatic  intercourse, convinced of the great benefit which would result to the  negotiators themselves, as well as to others! I give a literary curiosity  of this kind. A member of the House of Commons, in the reign of  Elizabeth, made a speech entirely composed of the most homely proverbs.  The subject was a bill against double payments of book-debts. Knavish  tradesmen were then in the habit of swelling out their book-debts with  those who took credit, particularly to their younger customers. One of  the members who began to speak \"for very fear shook,\" and stood silent.  The nervous orator was followed by a blunt and true representative of the  famed governor of Barataria, delivering himself thus--\"It is now my  chance to speak something, and that without humming or hawing. I think  this law is a good law. Even reckoning makes long friends. As far goes  the penny as the penny's master. _Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura  subveniunt._ Pay the reckoning overnight and ye shall not be troubled in  the morning. If ready money be _mensura publica_, let every one cut his  coat according to his cloth. When his old suit is in the wane, let him  stay till that his money bring a new suit in the increase.\"[35]    Another instance of the use of proverbs among our statesmen occurs in a  manuscript letter of Sir Dudley Carlton, written in 1632, on the  impeachment of Lord Middlesex, who, he says, is \"this day to plead his  own cause in the Exchequer-chamber, about an account of four-score  thousand pounds laid to his charge. How his lordship sped I know not,  but do remember well the French proverb, _Qui mange de l'oy du Roy  chiera une plume quarante ans apres_. 'Who eats of the king's goose,  will void a feather forty years after!'\"    This was the era of proverbs with us; for then they were _spoken_ by all  ranks of society. The free use of trivial proverbs got them into  disrepute; and as the abuse of a thing raises a just opposition to its  practice, a slender wit affecting \"a cross humour,\" published a little  volume of \"Crossing of Proverbs, Cross-answers, and Cross-humours.\" He  pretends to contradict the most popular ones; but he has not always the  genius to strike at amusing paradoxes.[36]    Proverbs were long the favourites of our neighbours; in the splendid and  refined court of Louis the Fourteenth they gave rise to an odd  invention. They plotted comedies and even fantastical ballets from their  subjects. In these Curiosities of Literature I cannot pass by such  eccentric inventions unnoticed.    A COMEDY _of proverbs_ is described by the Duke de la Valliere, which  was performed in 1634 with prodigious success. He considers that this  comedy ought to be ranked among farces; but it is gay, well-written, and  curious for containing the best proverbs, which are happily introduced  in the dialogue.    A more extraordinary attempt was a BALLET _of proverbs_. Before the  opera was established in France, the ancient ballets formed the chief  amusement of the court, and Louis the Fourteenth himself joined with the  performers. The singular attempt of forming a pantomimical dance out of  proverbs is quite French; we have a \"ballet des proverbes, danse par le  Roi, in 1654.\" At every proverb the scene changed, and adapted itself to  the subject. I shall give two or three of the _entrees_ that we may form  some notion of these _capriccios_.    The proverb was---      _Tel menace qui a grand peur._    He threatens who is afraid.    The scene was composed of swaggering scaramouches and some honest cits,  who at length beat them off.    At another _entree_ the proverb was--      _L'occasion fait le larron._    Opportunity makes the thief.    Opportunity was acted by le Sieur Beaubrun, but it is difficult to  conceive how the real could personify the abstract personage. The  thieves were the Duke d'Amville and Monsieur de la Chesnaye.    Another _entree_ was the proverb of--      _Ce qui vient de la flute s'en va au tambour._    What comes by the pipe goes by the tabor.    A loose dissipated officer was performed by le Sieur l'Anglois; the  _Pipe_ by St. Aignan, and the _Tabor_ by le Sieur le Comte! In this  manner every proverb was _spoken in action_, the whole connected by  dialogue. More must have depended on the actors than the poet.[37]    The French long retained this fondness for proverbs; for they still have  dramatic compositions entitled _proverbes_, on a more refined plan.  Their invention is so recent, that the term is not in their great  dictionary of Trevoux. These _proverbes_ are dramas of a single act,  invented by Carmontel, who possessed a peculiar vein of humour, but who  designed them only for private theatricals. Each _proverb_ furnished a  subject for a few scenes, and created a situation powerfully comic: it  is a dramatic amusement which does not appear to have reached us, but  one which the celebrated Catherine of Russia delighted to compose for  her own society.    Among the middle classes of society to this day, we may observe that  certain family proverbs are traditionally preserved: the favourite  saying of a father is repeated by the sons; and frequently the conduct  of a whole generation has been influenced by such domestic proverbs.  This may be perceived in many of the mottos of our old nobility, which  seem to have originated in some habitual proverb of the founder of the  family. In ages when proverbs were most prevalent, such pithy sentences  would admirably serve in the ordinary business of life, and lead on to  decision, even in its greater exigencies. Orators, by some lucky  proverb, without wearying their auditors, would bring conviction home to  their bosoms: and great characters would appeal to a proverb, or deliver  that which in time by its aptitude became one. When Nero was reproached  for the ardour with which he gave himself up to the study of music, he  replied to his censurers by the Greek proverb, \"An artist lives  everywhere.\" The emperor answered in the spirit of Rousseau's system,  that every child should be taught some trade. When Caesar, after anxious  deliberation, decided on the passage of the Rubicon (which very event  has given rise to a proverb), rousing himself with a start of courage,  he committed himself to Fortune, with that proverbial expression on his  lips, used by gamesters in desperate play: having passed the Rubicon, he  exclaimed, \"The die is cast!\" The answer of Paulus AEmilius to the  relations of his wife, who had remonstrated with him on his  determination to separate himself from her against whom no fault could  be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#11)"],[1," will  only cause them sorrow and many a heart-ache.\"    And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed  of this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is  astonishingly cunning. When the university students come from the  lectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under  his arm. It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk  along with him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like  themselves; and then, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom.  When the young maidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or  go to church to be confirmed, there he is again close behind them.  Yes, he is for ever following people. At the play he sits in the great  chandelier and burns in bright flames, so that people think it is  really a flame, but they soon discover it is something else. He roves  about in the garden of the palace and upon the ramparts: yes, once he  even shot your father and mother right in the heart. Ask them only,  and you will hear what they'll tell you. Oh, he is a naughty boy, that  Cupid; you must never have anything to do with him. He is for ever  running after everybody. Only think, he shot an arrow once at your old  grandmother! But that is a long time ago, and it is all past now;  however, a thing of that sort she never forgets. Fie, naughty Cupid!  But now you know him, and you know, too, how ill-behaved he is!      ------------        THE TWO NEIGHBORING FAMILIES.    We really might have thought something of importance was going on in  the duck-pond, but there was nothing going on. All the ducks that were  resting tranquilly on the water, or were standing in it on their  heads--for that they were able to do--swam suddenly to the shore: you  could see in the wet ground the traces of their feet, and hear their  quacking far and near. The water, which but just now was smooth and  bright as a mirror, was quite put into commotion. Before, one saw  every tree reflected in it, every bush that was near: the old  farm-house, with the holes in the roof and with the swallow's nest  under the eaves; but principally, however, the great rose-bush, sown,  as it were, with flowers. It covered the wall, and hung forwards over  the water, in which one beheld the whole as in a picture, except that  everything was upside down; but when the water was agitated, all swam  away and the picture was gone. Two duck's feathers, which the  fluttering ducks had lost, were rocking to and fro: suddenly they flew  forwards as if the wind were coming, but it did not come: they were,  therefore, obliged to remain where they were, and the water grew quiet  and smooth again, and again the roses reflected themselves--they were  so beautiful, but that they did not know, for nobody had told them.  The sun shone in between the tender leaves--all breathed the most  beautiful fragrance; and to them it was as with us, when right  joyfully we are filled with the thought of our happiness.    \"How beautiful is existence!\" said each rose. \"There is but one thing  I should wish for,--to kiss the sun, because it is so bright and  warm.* The roses yonder, too, below in the water, the exact image of  ourselves--them also I should like to kiss, and the nice little birds  below in their nest. There are some above, too; they stretch out their  heads and chirrup quite loud: they have no feathers at all, as their  fathers and mothers have. They are good neighbors, those below as well  as those above. How beautiful existence is!\"    The young birds above and below--those below of course the reflection  only in the water--were sparrows: their parents were likewise  sparrows; and they had taken possession of the empty swallow's nest of  the preceding year, and now dwelt therein as if it had been their own  property.    \"Are those little duck children that are swimming there?\" asked the  young sparrows, when they discovered the duck's feathers on the water.    ------    * In Danish the sun is of the feminine gender, and not, as with us,  when personified, spoken of as \"he.\" We beg to make this observation,  lest the roses' wish \"to kiss the sun,\" be thought unmaidenly. We are  anxious, also, to remove a stumbling block, which might perchance trip  up exquisitely-refined modern notions, sadly shocked, no doubt, as  they would be, at such an apparent breach of modesty and  decorum.--(Note of the Translator.)    ------    \"If you _will_ ask questions, do let them be a little rational at  least,\" said the mother. \"Don't you see that they are feathers, living  stuff for clothing such as I wear, and such as you will wear also? But  ours is finer. I should, however, be glad if we had it up here in our  nest, for it keeps one warm. I am curious to know at what the ducks  were so frightened; at us, surely not; 'tis true I said 'chirp,' to  you rather loud. In reality, the thick-headed roses ought to know, but  they know nothing; they only gaze on themselves and smell: for my  part, I am heartily tired of these neighbors.\"    \"Listen to the charming little birds above,\" said the roses, \"they  begin to want to sing too, but they cannot as yet. However, they will  do so by and by: what pleasure that must afford! It is so pleasant to  have such merry neighbors!\"    Suddenly two horses came galloping along to be watered. A peasant boy  rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes except his large  broad black hat. The youth whistled like a bird, and rode into the  pond where it was deepest; and as he passed by the rosebush he  gathered a rose and stuck it in his hat; and now he fancied himself  very fine, and rode on. The other roses looked after their sister, and  asked each other, \"Whither is she going?\" but that no one knew.    \"I should like to go out into the world,\" thought one; \"yet here at  home amid our foliage it is also beautiful. By day the sun shines so  warm, and in the night the sky shines still more beautifully: we can  see that through all the little holes that are in it.\" By this they  meant the stars, but they did not know any better.    \"We enliven the place,\" said the mamma sparrow; \"and the swallow's  nest brings luck, so people say, and therefore people are pleased to  have us. But our neighbors! Such a rose-bush against the wall produces  damp; it will doubtless be cleared away, and then, perhaps, some corn  at least may grow there. The roses are good for nothing except to look  at and to smell, and, at most to put into one's hat. Every year--that  I know from my mother--they fall away; the peasants wife collects them  together and strews salt among them; they then receive a French name  which I neither can nor care to pronounce, and are put upon the fire,  when they are to give a pleasant odor. Look ye, such is their life;  they are only here to please the eye and nose! And so now you know the  whole matter.\"    As the evening came on, and the gnats played in the warm air and in  the red clouds, the nightingale came and sang to the roses; sang that  the beautiful is as the sunshine in this world, and that the beautiful  lives for ever. But the roses thought that the nightingale sang his  own praise, which one might very well have fancied; for that the song  related to them, of that they never thought: they rejoiced in it,  however, and meditated if perhaps all the little sparrows could become  nightingales too.    \"I understood _the song of that bird quite well_,\" said the young  sparrows; \"one word only was not quite clear to me. What was the  meaning of 'the beautiful?'\"    \"That is nothing,\" said the mamma sparrow, \"that is only something  external. Yonder at the mansion, where the pigeons have a house of  their own, and where every day peas and corn is strewn before them--I  have myself eaten there with them, and you shall, too, in time; tell  me what company you keep, and I'll tell you who you are--yes, yonder  at the mansion they have got two birds with green necks and a comb on  their head; they can spread out their tail like a great wheel, and in  it plays every color, that it quite hurts one's eyes to look at it.  These birds are called peacocks, and that is 'THE BEAUTIFUL.' They  only want to be plucked a little, and then they would not look at all  different from the rest of us. I would already have plucked them, if  they had not been quite so big.\"    \"I will pluck them,\" chirped the smallest sparrow, that as yet had not  a single feather.    In the peasant's cottage dwelt a young married couple; they loved each  other dearly, and were industrious and active: everything in their  house looked so neat and pretty. On Sunday morning early the young  woman came out, gathered a handful of the most beautiful roses, and  put them into a glass of water, which she placed on the shelf.    \"Now I see that it is Sunday,\" said the man, and kissed his little  wife. They sat down, read in the hymn-book, and held each other by the  hand: the sun beamed on the fresh roses and on the young married  couple.    \"This is really too tiring a sight,\" said the mamma sparrow, who from  her nest could look into the room, and away she flew.    The next Sunday it was the same, for every Sunday fresh roses were put  in the glass: yet the rose-tree bloomed on equally beautiful. The  young sparrows had now feathers, and wanted much to fly with their  mother; she, however, would not allow it, so they were forced to  remain. Off she flew; but, however, it happened, before she was aware,  she got entangled in a springe of horse-hair, which some boys had set  upon a bough. The horse-hair drew itself tightly round her leg, so  tightly as though it would cut it in two. That was an agony, a fright!  The boys ran to the spot and caught hold of the bird, and that too in  no very gentle manner.    \"It's only a sparrow,\" said they; but they, nevertheless, did not let  her fly, but took her home with them, and every time she cried they  gave her a tap on the beak.
