JACK FROST (_raps sharply on the inside of the barrel_).    ANITA. Oh, what was that? I thought I heard something. (_Goes toward  barrel cautiously._) Maybe it is the leetla, teeny-weeny baby mouse.  (Rises on tiptoes to peer into the barrel.) I'll just peek in and see.  (_Just as she looks into the barrel_, JACK FROST _pops up his head  almost in her very face._)    JACK FROST. Hello!    ANITA (_starting back, very much frightened_). Oh!    JACK FROST. Did you say oh, or hello?    ANITA. I just said, oh.    JACK FROST. Well, then, hello. (_Climbs out of the barrel._)    ANITA. Hello.    JACK FROST (_goes to her_). You aren't frightened, are you?    ANITA (_at R._). Well, I'm a leetla frightened, but not verra much.    JACK FROST. Why? I won't hurt you.    ANITA. You came up so sudden. I never expected to find a boy in that  barrel. And you are such a queer looking boy.    JACK FROST. Boy? I'm not a boy.    ANITA. You're not? You look like a boy. You're not a girl, are you?    JACK FROST (_indignantly_). Well, I should say not! I'm just a kind of  a sort of a kind of an idea, that's all. I'm your imagination.    ANITA. I hope you're not a goblin.    JACK FROST. Oh, no. I'm not a goblin. They're old and have long  beards. I'm not old at all. (_Twirls around on toes._) See, I'm even  younger than you are. (_Makes low bow._) I'm a pixie.    ANITA. And what is a pixie?    JACK FROST. I told you before, it's just your imagination.    ANITA. You look like a boy. What is your name?    JACK FROST. My name is Claus.    ANITA. Claus! Why, what a funny leetla name. I never heard a name like  that in Italy. Claus what?    JACK FROST. Santa Claus. Haven't you ever heard of Santa Claus?    ANITA. Oh, yes; many, many times. But you _can't_ be Santa Claus.    JACK FROST (_indignantly_). I'd like to know why I can't! It's my  name, isn't it?    ANITA. But you are not the real, real truly Santa Claus. He is an old,  old man. A leetla fat old man with white-a hair just like-a the snow,  and a long, white-a beard.    JACK FROST. Ho, you must be thinking of my daddy.    ANITA. Your daddy? Is Santa Claus your daddy?    JACK FROST. Sure, he is. I'm Jack Frost Santa Claus, Jr. Most folks  call me Jolly Jack Frost. The little fat man with the white beard is  my father.    ANITA (_astonished_). Why, I didn't know Santa Claus had any leetla  boys.    JACK FROST. Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer,  and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?    ANITA. Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?    JACK FROST. Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down  Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees.  You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.    ANITA. Oh, I'd love to see them.    JACK FROST. We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a  furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most  of the candy comes from mines.    ANITA. The mines?    JACK FROST. Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel  mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and  rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right  through the picture-book garden.    ANITA. Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.    JACK FROST. And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little  brothers, and we're all twins.    ANITA. And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a  wife?    JACK FROST (_laughs_). Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever  heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.    ANITA. Mary? Mary what?    JACK FROST. Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone  knew that.    ANITA. And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night  before Christmas?    JACK FROST. Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and  takes care of the gardens.    ANITA. But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd  be with your father.    JACK FROST. Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.    ANITA. How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.    JACK FROST. Well, maybe I'll tell you.    ANITA. Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg,  grand-a secret.    JACK FROST. You can keep a secret, can't you?    ANITA. Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.    JACK FROST. Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your  name's Anita, isn't it?    ANITA. Yes. But how did you know?    JACK FROST. Oh, we know everything. How old are you?    ANITA. If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I  am.    JACK FROST. Well, I just guessed it.    ANITA. Then why don't you guess how old I am?    JACK FROST. Cute, ain't you?    ANITA. Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.    JACK FROST. Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you  must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.    ANITA. Cross my heart. (_She does so._)    JACK FROST (_crosses to her_). Listen, then; here's the secret. (_He  whispers in her ear._)    ANITA (_after a pause, while he is whispering_). He is? _He is?_ Oh!!    JACK FROST (_nods his head wisely_). Yes, he is.    ANITA. Honest?    JACK FROST. Honest injun!    ANITA. With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?    JACK FROST (_nods head emphatically_). Yes, ma'am, every single thing.    ANITA. Tonight?    JACK FROST. Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little  children in the steerage are asleep.    ANITA. But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?    JACK FROST. Fly.    ANITA. Fly? But he hasn't any wings. (JACK _nods._) He has? (JACK  _nods._) Really and truly wings?    JACK FROST (_nods_). Really and truly wings.    ANITA. I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.    JACK FROST. He only bought them this year.    ANITA. Bought them? (JACK _nods._) Then they didn't grow on him?    JACK FROST (_laughs_). Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.    ANITA. Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.    JACK FROST. He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only  uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air  ship. (_Sits down._) Oh, I'm tired.    ANITA. I didn't know pixies ever got tired.    JACK FROST. You ought to see the work I've done today.    ANITA. Here on the boat?    JACK FROST. Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.    ANITA. Oh, show me.    JACK FROST. I will. But it's part of the secret. (_Goes to rear L._)  Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.    ANITA (_goes to him_). It isn't anything scary, is it?    JACK FROST. Of course not. (_Lets her peep through the curtain that  conceals the Christmas tree from the audience._) There; what do you  think of that?    ANITA. Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words.  Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It  is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell  Tomasso.    JACK FROST. Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell  anybody.    ANITA. But are you really, truly sure he's coming?    JACK FROST. Of course he is. That is our secret.    ANITA. Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I  will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas  surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll  always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus  and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.    JACK FROST. What are you going to do when you get to America?    ANITA. I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de  grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr.  Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro  Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.    JACK FROST. Take the monkey's place?    ANITA. Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my  tambourine, so! (_Poses and holds out tambourine._) And then I will-a  collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.    JACK FROST (_mocking her_). I suppose you are going to wear a leetla  red cap and jump up and down this way (_imitates a monkey_), and say,  \"Give-a de monk de cent!\"    ANITA (_laughing_). Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and  dance the leetla dance, so! (_Hums and dances, or a song may be  introduced at this point by_ ANITA.) Then, when I'm finished, I go to  the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so!  (_Does so._) And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does  he?    JACK FROST (_sighs, then drops a nickel in tambourine_). Yes, I guess  he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give  you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.    ANITA. And you must not forget the leetla Dutch twins, and my cousin  Tomasso, and Hulda and Meeny and Sergius and Ah Goo and Sano San and  Needla and Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike and all the rest.    JACK FROST. Whew! That's a big order. But we won't forget a single  soul on Christmas Day. And now I've got to go and put the finishing  touches on--you know what! (_Goes behind curtains that conceal the  Christmas tree._)    ANITA (_looks around_). Why, he's gone.    JACK FROST (_sticking his head out of the curtains_). The sun has set,  it's out of sight, so little Jack Frost will say good-night!  (_Disappears back of curtains._)    ANITA. Good-night, Jolly Jack Frost, good-night. Oh, it's the most  wonderful secret in all the world. And won't the leetla children be  glad to know that old Santa Claus has not forgotten them. He said that  Santa Claus was coming tonight in the air ship, and it's got to be  true, it's just got to be true.    _Enter_ TOMASSO _from R., carrying violin._    TOMASSO. Anita, if you don't hurry you'll not get any supper at all.  It's most eight o'clock.    ANITA. Oh, I don't care for supper, Tomasso. I could-a not eat. I'm  too much excited to eat.    TOMASSO. What make-a you so excited, Anita?    ANITA."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19831"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"constitutional obligations, which had  nullified a previous law of Congress for the execution of a provision of  the Constitution, and had murdered men who came peacefully to recover  their property, would evade or obstruct, so as to render practically  worthless, _any_ law that could be enacted for that purpose. In the  exceptional cases in which it might be executed, the event would be  attended with such conflict between the State and Federal authorities as  to produce consequent evils greater than those it was intended to  correct.    It was during the progress of these memorable controversies that the  South lost its most trusted leader, and the Senate its greatest and  purest statesman. He was taken from us--      \"Like a summer-dried fountain,    When our need was the sorest;\"--    when his intellectual power, his administrative talent, his love of  peace, and his devotion to the Constitution, might have averted  collision; or, failing in that, he might have been to the South the  Palinurus to steer the bark in safety over the perilous sea. Truly did  Mr. Webster--his personal friend, although his greatest political  rival--say of him in his obituary address, \"There was nothing groveling,  or low, or meanly selfish, that came near the head or the heart of Mr.  Calhoun.\" His prophetic warnings speak from the grave with the wisdom of  inspiration. Would that they could have been appreciated by his  countrymen while he yet lived!        Note.--While the compromise measures of 1850 were pending, and      the excitement concerning them was at its highest, I one day      overtook Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, and Mr. Berrien, of Georgia, in      the Capitol grounds. They were in earnest conversation. It was      the 7th of March--the day on which Mr. Webster had delivered his      great speech. Mr. Clay, addressing me in the friendly manner      which he had always employed since I was a schoolboy in      Lexington, asked me what I thought of the speech. I liked it      better than he did. He then suggested that I should \"join the      compromise men,\" saying that it was a measure which he thought      would probably give peace to the country for thirty years--the      period that had elapsed since the adoption of the compromise of      1820. Then, turning to Mr. Berrien, he said, \"You and I will be      under ground before that time, but our young friend here may      have trouble to meet.\" I somewhat impatiently declared my      unwillingness to transfer to posterity a trial which they would      be relatively less able to meet than we were, and passed on my      way.      [Footnote 9: The vote in the Senate on the proposition to continue the  line of the Missouri Compromise through the newly acquired territory to  the Pacific was twenty-four yeas, to thirty-two nays. Reckoning Delaware  and Missouri as Southern States, the vote of the two sections was  exactly equal. The yeas were _all_ cast by Southern Senators; the nays  were all Northern, except two from Delaware, one from Missouri, and one  from Kentucky.]          CHAPTER III.        Reelection to the Senate.--Political Controversies in      Mississippi.--Action of the Democratic State Convention.--Defeat      of the State-Rights Party.--Withdrawal of General Quitman and      Nomination of the Author as Candidate for the Office of      Governor.--The Canvass and its Result.--Retirement to Private      Life.      I had been reelected by the Legislature of Mississippi as my own  successor, and entered upon a new term of service in the Senate on March  4, 1851.    On my return to Mississippi in 1851, the subject chiefly agitating the  public mind was that of the \"compromise\" measures of the previous year.  Consequent upon these was a proposition for a convention of delegates,  from the people of the Southern States respectively, to consider what  steps ought to be taken for their future peace and safety, and the  preservation of their constitutional rights. There was diversity of  opinion with regard to the merits of the measures referred to, but the  disagreement no longer followed the usual lines of party division. They  who saw in those measures the forerunner of disaster to the South had no  settled policy beyond a convention, the object of which should be to  devise new and more effectual guarantees against the perils of  usurpation. They were unjustly charged with a desire to destroy the  Union--a feeling entertained by few, very few, if by any, in  Mississippi, and avowed by none.    There were many, however, who held that the principles of the  Declaration of Independence, and the purposes for which the Union was  formed, were of higher value than the mere Union itself. Independence  existed before the compact of union between the States; and, if that  compact should be broken in part, and therefore destroyed in whole, it  was hoped that the liberties of the people in the States might still be  preserved. Those who were most devoted to the Union of the Constitution  might, consequently, be expected to resist most sternly any usurpation  of undelegated power, the effect of which would be to warp the Federal  Government from its proper character, and, by sapping the foundation, to  destroy the Union of the States.    My recent reelection to the United States Senate had conferred upon me  for six years longer the office which I preferred to all others. I could  not, therefore, be suspected of desiring a nomination for any other  office from the Democratic Convention, the meeting of which was then  drawing near. Having, as a Senator of the State, freely participated in  debate on the measures which were now exciting so much interest in the  public mind, it was very proper that I should visit the people in  different parts of the State and render an account of my stewardship.    My devotion to the Union of our fathers had been so often and so  publicly declared; I had, on the floor of the Senate, so defiantly  challenged any question of my fidelity to it; my services, civil and  military, had now extended through so long a period, and were so  generally known--that I felt quite assured that no whisperings of envy  or ill will could lead the people of Mississippi to believe that I had  dishonored their trust by using the power they had conferred on me to  destroy the Government to which I was accredited. Then, as afterward, I  regarded the separation of the States as a great, though not the  greatest, evil.    I returned from my tour among the people at the time appointed for the  meeting of the nominating convention of the Democratic (or State-Rights)  party. During the previous year the Governor, General John A. Quitman,  had been compelled to resign his office to answer an indictment against  him for complicity with the \"filibustering\" expeditions against Cuba.  The charges were not sustained; many of the Democratic party of  Mississippi, myself included, recognized a consequent obligation to  renominate him for the office of which he had been deprived. When,  however, the delegates met in party convention, the committee appointed  to select candidates, on comparison of opinions, concluded that, in view  of the effort to fix upon the party the imputation of a purpose of  disunion, some of the antecedents of General Quitman might endanger  success. A proposition was therefore made, in the committee on  nominations, that I should be invited to become a candidate, and that,  if General Quitman would withdraw, my acceptance of the nomination and  the resignation of my place in the United States Senate, which it was  known would result, was to be followed by the appointment by the  Governor of General Quitman to the vacated place in the Senate. I  offered no objection to this arrangement, but left it to General Quitman  to decide. He claimed the nomination for the governorship, or nothing,  and was so nominated.    To promote the success of the Democratic nominees, I engaged actively in  the canvass, and continued in the field until stricken down by disease.  This occurred just before the election of delegates to a State  Convention, for which provision had been made by the Legislature, and  the canvass for which, conducted in the main upon party lines, was in  progress simultaneously with that for the ordinary State officers. The  Democratic majority in the State when the canvass began was estimated at  eight thousand. At this election, in September, for delegates to the  State Convention, we were beaten by about seven thousand five hundred  votes. Seeing in this result the foreshadowing of almost inevitable  defeat, General Quitman withdrew from the canvass as a candidate, and  the Executive Committee of the party (empowered to fill vacancies)  called on me to take his place. My health did not permit me to leave  home at that time, and only about six weeks remained before the election  was to take place; but, being assured that I was not expected to take  any active part, and that the party asked only the use of my name, I  consented to be announced, and immediately resigned from the United  States Senate. Nevertheless, I soon afterward took the field in person,  and worked earnestly until the day of election. I was defeated, but the  majority of more than seven thousand votes, that had been cast a short  time before against the party with which I was associated, was reduced  to less than one thousand.[10]    In this canvass, both before and after I became a candidate, no argument  or appeal of mine was directed against the perpetuation of the Union.  Believing, however, that the signs of the time portended danger to the  South from the usurpation by the General Government of undelegated  powers, I counseled that Mississippi should enter into the proposed  meeting of the people of the Southern States, to consider what could and  should be done to insure our future safety, frankly stating my  conviction that, unless such action were taken then, sectional "]]]
