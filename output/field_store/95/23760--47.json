Neque  fas esse existimant ea litteris mandare, cum in reliquis fere rebus,  publicis privatisque rationibus Graecis litteris utantur. Id mihi duabus  de causis instituisse videntur, quod neque in vulgum disciplinam efferri  velint neque eos, qui discunt, litteris confisos minus memoriae studere:  quod fere plerisque accidit, ut praesidio litterarum diligentiam in  perdiscendo ac memoriam remittant. In primis hoc volunt persuadere, non  interire animas, sed ab aliis post mortem transire ad alios, atque hoc  maxime ad virtutem excitari putant metu mortis neglecto. Multa praeterea  de sideribus atque eorum motu, de mundi ac terrarum magnitudine, de  rerum natura, de deorum immortalium vi ac potestate disputant et  iuventuti tradunt.      15    Alterum genus est equitum. Hi, cum est usus atque aliquod bellum incidit  (quod fere ante Caesaris adventum quotannis accidere solebat, uti aut  ipsi iniurias inferrent aut illatas propulsarent), omnes in bello  versantur, atque eorum ut quisque est genere copiisque amplissimus, ita  plurimos circum se ambactos clientesque habet. Hanc unam gratiam  potentiamque noverunt.      16    Natio est omnis Gallorum admodum dedita religionibus, atque ob eam  causam, qui sunt adfecti gravioribus morbis quique in proeliis  periculisque versantur, aut pro victimis homines immolant aut se  immolaturos vovent administrisque ad ea sacrificia druidibus utuntur,  quod, pro vita hominis nisi hominis vita reddatur, non posse deorum  immortalium numen placari arbitrantur, publiceque eiusdem generis habent  instituta sacrificia. Alii immani magnitudine simulacra habent, quorum  contexta viminibus membra vivis hominibus complent; quibus succensis  circumventi flamma exanimantur homines. Supplicia eorum qui in furto aut  in latrocinio aut aliqua noxia sint comprehensi gratiora dis  immortalibus esse arbitrantur; sed, cum eius generis copia defecit,  etiam ad innocentium supplicia descendunt.      17    Deum maxime Mercurium colunt. Huius sunt plurima simulacra: hunc omnium  inventorem artium ferunt, hunc viarum atque itinerum ducem, hunc ad  quaestus pecuniae mercaturasque habere vim maximam arbitrantur. Post  hunc Apollinem et Martem et Iovem et Minervam. De his eandem fere, quam  reliquae gentes, habent opinionem: Apollinem morbos depellere, Minervam  operum atque artificiorum initia tradere, Iovem imperium caelestium  tenere, Martem bella regere. Huic, cum proelio dimicare constituerunt,  ea quae bello ceperint plerumque devovent: cum superaverunt, animalia  capta immolant reliquasque res in unum locum conferunt. Multis in  civitatibus harum rerum exstructos tumulos locis consecratis conspicari  licet; neque saepe accidit, ut neglecta quispiam religione aut capta  apud se occultare aut posita tollere auderet, gravissimumque ei rei  supplicium cum cruciatu constitutum est.      18    Galli se omnes ab Dite patre prognatos praedicant idque ab druidibus  proditum dicunt. Ob eam causam spatia omnis temporis non numero dierum  sed noctium finiunt; dies natales et mensum et annorum initia sic  observant ut noctem dies subsequatur. In reliquis vitae institutis hoc  fere ab reliquis differunt, quod suos liberos, nisi cum adoleverunt, ut  munus militiae sustinere possint, palam ad se adire non patiuntur  filiumque puerili aetate in publico in conspectu patris adsistere turpe  ducunt.      19    Viri, quantas pecunias ab uxoribus dotis nomine acceperunt, tantas ex  suis bonis aestimatione facta cum dotibus communicant. Huius omnis  pecuniae coniunctim ratio habetur fructusque servantur: uter eorum vita  superarit, ad eum pars utriusque cum fructibus superiorum temporum  pervenit. Viri in uxores, sicuti in liberos, vitae necisque habent  potestatem; et cum paterfamiliae illustriore loco natus decessit, eius  propinqui conveniunt et, de morte si res in suspicionem venit, de  uxoribus in servilem modum quaestionem habent et, si compertum est, igni  atque omnibus tormentis excruciatas interficiunt. Funera sunt pro cultu  Gallorum magnifica et sumptuosa; omniaque quae vivis cordi fuisse  arbitrantur in ignem inferunt, etiam animalia, ac paulo supra hanc  memoriam servi et clientes, quos ab eis dilectos esse constabat, iustis  funeribus confectis una cremabantur.      20    Quae civitates commodius suam rem publicam administrare existimantur,  habent legibus sanctum, si quis quid de re publica a finitimis rumore  aut fama acceperit, uti ad magistratum deferat neve cum quo alio  communicet, quod saepe homines temerarios atque imperitos falsis  rumoribus terreri et ad facinus impelli et de summis rebus consilium  capere cognitum est. Magistratus quae visa sunt occultant quaeque esse  ex usu iudicaverunt multitudini produnt. De re publica nisi per  concilium loqui non conceditur.      21    Germani multum ab hac consuetudine differunt. Nam neque druides habent,  qui rebus divinis praesint, neque sacrificiis student. Deorum numero eos  solos ducunt, quos cernunt et quorum aperte opibus iuvantur, Solem et  Vulcanum et Lunam, reliquos ne fama quidem acceperunt. Vita omnis in  venationibus atque in studiis rei militaris consistit: ab parvulis  labori ac duritiae student. Qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt,  maximam inter suos ferunt laudem: hoc ali staturam, ali vires nervosque  confirmari putant. Intra annum vero vicesimum feminae notitiam habuisse  in turpissimis habent rebus; cuius rei nulla est occultatio, quod et  promiscue in fluminibus perluuntur et pellibus aut parvis renonum  tegimentis utuntur magna corporis parte nuda.      22    Agriculturae non student, maiorque pars eorum victus in lacte, caseo,  carne consistit. Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet  proprios; sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos gentibus  cognationibusque hominum, qui una coierunt, quantum et quo loco visum  est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio transire cogunt. Eius rei  multas adferunt causas: ne adsidua consuetudine capti studium belli  gerendi agricultura commutent; ne latos fines parare studeant,  potentioresque humiliores possessionibus expellant; ne accuratius ad  frigora atque aestus vitandos aedificent; ne qua oriatur pecuniae  cupiditas, qua ex re factiones dissensionesque nascuntur; ut animi  aequitate plebem contineant, cum suas quisque opes cum potentissimis  aequari videat.      23    Civitatibus maxima laus est quam latissime circum se vastatis finibus  solitudines habere. Hoc proprium virtutis existimant, expulsos agris  finitimos cedere, neque quemquam prope audere consistere; simul hoc se  fore tutiores arbitrantur repentinae incursionis timore sublato. Cum  bellum civitas aut illa tum defendit aut infert, magistratus, qui ei  bello praesint, ut vitae necisque habeant potestatem, deliguntur. In  pace nullus est communis magistratus, sed principes regionum atque  pagorum inter suos ius dicunt controversiasque minuunt. Latrocinia  nullam habent infamiam, quae extra fines cuiusque civitatis fiunt, atque  ea iuventutis exercendae ac desidiae minuendae causa fieri praedicant.  Atque ubi quis ex principibus in concilio dixit se ducem fore, qui sequi  velint, profiteantur, consurgunt ei qui et causam et hominem probant  suumque auxilium pollicentur atque ab multitudine collaudantur: qui ex  his secuti non sunt, in desertorum ac proditorum numero ducuntur,  omniumque his rerum postea fides derogatur. Hospitem violare fas non  putant; qui quacumque de causa ad eos venerunt, ab iniuria prohibent,  sanctos habent, hisque omnium domus patent victusque communicatur.      24    Ac fuit antea tempus, cum Germanos Galli virtute superarent, ultro bella  inferrent, propter hominum multitudinem agrique inopiam trans Rhenum  colonias mitterent. Itaque ea quae fertilissima Germaniae sunt loca  circum Hercyniam silvam, quam Eratostheni et quibusdam Graecis fama  notam esse video, quam illi Orcyniam appellant, Volcae Tectosages  occupaverunt atque ibi consederunt; quae gens ad hoc tempus his sedibus  sese continet summamque habet iustitiae et bellicae laudis opinionem.  Nunc quod in eadem inopia, egestate, patientia qua Germani permanent,  eodem victu et cultu corporis utuntur; Gallis autem provinciarum  propinquitas et transmarinarum rerum notitia multa ad copiam atque usus  largitur, paulatim adsuefacti superari multisque victi proeliis ne se  quidem ipsi cum illis virtute comparant.      25    Huius Hercyniae silvae, quae supra demonstrata est, latitudo novem  dierum iter expedito patet: non enim aliter finiri potest, neque  mensuras itinerum noverunt. Oritur ab Helvetiorum et Nemetum et  Rauracorum finibus rectaque fluminis Danubi regione pertinet ad fines  Dacorum et Anartium; hinc se flectit sinistrorsus diversis ab flumine  regionibus multarumque gentium fines propter magnitudinem adtingit;  neque quisquam est huius Germaniae, qui se aut adisse ad initium eius  silvae dicat, cum dierum iter LX processerit, aut, quo ex loco oriatur,  acceperit: multaque in ea genera ferarum nasci constat, quae reliquis in  locis visa non sint; ex quibus quae maxime differant ab ceteris et  memoriae prodenda videantur haec sunt.      26    Est bos cervi figura, cuius a media fronte inter aures unum cornu  exsistit excelsius magisque directum his, quae nobis nota sunt,  cornibus: ab eius summo sicut palmae ramique late divunduntur. Eadem est  feminae marisque natura, eadem forma magnitudoque cornuum.      27    Sunt item, quae appellantur alces. Harum est consimilis capris figura et  varietas pellium, sed magrutudine paulo antecedunt mutilaeque sunt  cornibus et crura sine nodis articulisque habent neque quietis causa  procumbunt neque, si quo adflictae casu conciderunt, erigere sese aut  sublevare possunt. His sunt arbores pro cubilibus: ad eas se applicant  atque ita paulum modo reclinatae quietem capiunt. Quarum ex vestigiis  cum est animadversum a venatoribus, quo se recipere consuerint, omnes eo  loco aut ab radicibus subruunt aut accidunt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18843"],[0,"Applied Psychology for Nurses (#8)"],[1,"in his  mind's experience and proclaims, as a fact, that he sees his father.    _Reason_ is the mind's comparison and grouping of concepts to form  judgments, and its association of judgments to form new judgments.    Example: My concept _man_ includes the eventual certainty of his death.  My concept mortal means \"subject to death.\" Therefore my judgment is,  \"Man is mortal.\" Reason has compared the concepts and found that the  second includes the first.    _Judgment_ is the mind's decision arrived at through comparing concepts  or other judgments.    Example: _Man is mortal_ is my decision after comparing the concepts  _man_ and _mortal_ and finding that the latter really includes the  former. Judgment at the same time says that \"Mortals are men,\" is not a  true conclusion. For in this case the first concept is not all included  in the second. Mortals are all life that is subject to death.    We may assume personal consciousness even as we recognize an individual  body. Psychology does not deal with any awareness separated from a  person. It knows no central mind of which you partake or I partake, and  which is the same for us both. A universal consciousness would simply  mean one which is the sum of yours and mine and everybody's who lives  today, or who has ever lived. So by _personal consciousness_ the  psychologist means his consciousness, or yours, or mine. But they can  never be the same; for mine is determined by my entire past and by how  things and facts and qualities affect me; and yours, by your past, and  by things and facts and qualities, and by how they affect you.    _Personal consciousness_ is the mind's recognition of self; and as the  self changes with every added experience, so personal consciousness is  modified.    _Stream of thought_ is a term _James_ has brought into common usage to  illustrate the fact, already stressed, that thinking, as we know it, is  never static, is never one thing, one percept, one concept, one  judgment; but is a lot of these all together, just beginning to be or  just beginning to change into something else. We never know a concept,  for instance, except as it is a part of our entire consciousness,  related to all the rest; just as we do not know the drop of water in the  brook as it flows with the stream. We can take up one on our  finger-tips, however, and separate it from all the rest. But analyzed in  the laboratory, this drop will contain all the elements that a pint or  gallon or a barrel of the same water contains. The drop is what it is  because the stream has a certain composition. We only have a brook as  drops of rain combine to make it, but we also have only the drops as we  separate them from the steam.    _Imagination_ is the combining by the mind, in a new way, things already  known.    This may be either into fantastic groupings divorced from reality, or  into new, possible, rational groupings not yet experienced. So  imagination is of two kinds, the fantastic and the constructive.  Fantastic imagination, or fantasy, gives us gnomes, fairies, giants, and  flying horses, and all the delights of fairy tales. Constructive  imagination is the basis for invention, for literature, and the arts and  sciences.    The word _thinking_, defined early in this chapter, is broadly used to  denote the sum of all the intellectual faculties. Thinking is really the  stream of thought.          CHAPTER VI    THE NORMAL MIND (Continued)      INSTINCT    We have found that the mind's chief end is action, of itself, or of its  body. But what are its incentives to action?    We see the very young baby giving evidences of an emotional life, living  in an affective, or feeling environment, leading a pleasure-pain  existence, from the first. He acts as desire indicates. But from the  very moment of his birth he performs actions with which he cannot as yet  have a sense-memory connection, because he is doing them for the first  time. How can he know how to respond to stimuli from the very beginning?    No other possible explanation offers itself than that he is born with  certain tendencies to definite action. These we call instincts--man's  provision to keep him going, as it were, till reason develops. Instincts  are handed down from all the past. Definite tendencies, they are, to  certain specific reflex actions in response to certain sensations. These  responses, from the very beginning of animal life, have been toward  avoiding pain, and toward receiving pleasure. It is as though the  stimulus presses the trigger--instinct--and the muscle responds  instantly with reflex action. This mechanism is the means of protection  and advancement, and takes largely the place of intelligence in all  animal life. It is what makes the baby suck and cry, clutch and pull,  until a sense memory is established. So instinct is really race memory.  We call instinctive those immediate, unthought reactions which are the  same with all mankind.    The pugnacious instinct--the desire to fight--is the natural reaction of  every human being of sane mind to attack. The inner necessity of  avenging is so strong in the child or man of untrained mind or soul that  he acts before he thinks. He strikes back, or shoots, or plots against  his enemies. Only rare development of spirit or the cautious warning of  reason which foresees ill consequences, or a will trained to force  control, can later make the instinct inactive.    Where instinct ends and sense memory, imitation, and desire step in is  difficult to determine. Later in life probably most of what we consider  instinctive action is simply so-called reflex action, depending on sense  memory, action learned so young that it is difficult to distinguish it  from the true reflex action, which is due only to race memory.    James, in his _Talk to Teachers_, gives us a partial list of the  instincts. Thus:      Fear         Ownership              Shyness    Love         Constructiveness       Secretiveness    Curiosity    Love of approbation    The ambitious impulses:                                              Imitation,                                              Emulation,                                              Pride,                                              Ambition,                                              Pugnacity    To this partial list we would add self-preservation, reproduction, etc.    But instincts conflict with each other, and man carries about with him  in babyhood many of them which may have been very useful to his  prehistoric ancestors, but which only complicate things for him. Fear  and curiosity urge opposite lines of conduct. Love of approbation and  shyness are opposed. Love and pugnacity are apt to be at odds. So,  gradually, as intelligence increases, the child refuses to allow such  impulses to lead him to action. When fear-instinct and love-instinct are  at war, reason is provided to come to the rescue.    _Instincts_ are racial tendencies of sensational or emotional states to  determine action.    Instincts are the germs of habit, and when instinct would give rise to a  reaction no longer useful, reason, abetted by new habit formation, in  the normal mind, weakens instinct's force; and the habit is discarded  and the instinct gradually declines.    In prehistoric times when food was scarce, and man had not learned the  art of tilling the soil, hunger forced him to fight for what he got to  eat. As there was often not enough to go around, he maimed or killed  his fellow-man that he might have all he wanted, obeying the instinct to  survive. So, now, the baby instinctively clutches for all that appeals  to him. But an abundance of food for all, or the intelligent realization  that co-operation brings more to the individual than does fighting, and  a developed sense of responsibility toward others; or merely the fear of  the scorn of fellow beings, or the desire to be protected by the love of  his kind; perhaps a genuine love of people, acquired by spiritual  development, puts the primitive habit of food-grabbing into the discard.  Finally, the very instinct of self-preservation may be transformed into  desire to serve others. No better illustration of this can ever be  offered than the sacrifices of the World War.      MEMORY    No mind retains consciously everything that has ever impressed it. It is  necessary that it put aside what ceases to be of importance or value and  make way for new impressions. We found early in our study that the  subconscious never forgets, but harbors the apparently forgotten  throughout the years, allowing it to modify our thinking, our reactions.  But the conscious mind cannot be cluttered with the things of little  importance when the more essential is clamoring. So there is a  forgetting that is very normal. We forget numberless incidents of our  childhood and youth; we may forget the details of much that we have  learned to do automatically; but the subconscious mind is attending to  them for us.    Do you know how to skate? and if so, do you remember just how you did it  the first time? Probably all you recall is that you fell again and again  because your feet would slip away from where you meant them to be. When  you glide over the ice now it is as natural as walking, and as easy. You  cannot remember in detail at all how you first \"struck out,\" nor the  position of your feet and arms and legs, which you felt forced to  assume. At the time there was very real difficulty with every  stroke--each one was an accomplishment to be attempted circumspectly, in  a certain definite way. All you remember now is, vaguely, a tumble or  two, soreness, and lots of fun.    We forget details we have intrusted to others as not a part of our  responsibility. We forget the things which in no way concern us, in  which we have no interest and about which we have no curiosity. And it  is well that we do so. If it were not for the ability to forget, our  minds would be like a room in which"]]]
