Now you know that Buster is a very big fellow, and it takes a  lot to fill him up. He kept eating and eating and eating, and the more  he ate the more he wanted. You know how it is. So he wandered from one  patch of berries to another in the Old Pasture, and never once thought  of the time. Somehow, time is the hardest thing in the world to  remember, when you are having a good time.    Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and higher in the blue, blue  sky. He looked down on all the Great World and saw all that was going  on. He saw Buster Bear in the Old Pasture, and smiled as he saw what a  perfectly glorious time Buster was having. And he saw something else in  the Old Pasture that made his smile still broader. He saw Farmer Brown's  boy filling a great tin pail with blueberries, and he knew that Farmer  Brown's boy didn't know that Buster Bear was anywhere about, and he knew  that Buster Bear didn't know that Farmer Brown's boy was anywhere about,  and somehow he felt very sure that he would see something funny happen  if they should chance to meet.    \"Um-m-m, um-m-m,\" mumbled Buster Bear with his mouth full, as he moved  along to another patch of berries. And then he gave a little gasp of  surprise and delight. Right in front of him was a shiny thing just full  of the finest, biggest, bluest berries! There were no leaves or green  ones there. Buster blinked his greedy little eyes rapidly and looked  again. No, he wasn't dreaming. They were real berries, and all he had  got to do was to help himself. Buster looked sharply at the shiny thing  that held the berries. It seemed perfectly harmless. He reached out a  big paw and pushed it gently. It tipped over and spilled out a lot of  the berries. Yes, it was perfectly harmless. Buster gave a little sigh  of pure happiness. He would eat those berries to the last one, and then  he would go home to the Green Forest.          XX    BUSTER BEAR CARRIES OFF THE PAIL OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY      The question is, did Buster Bear steal Farmer Brown's boy's pail? To  steal is to take something which belongs to some one else. There is no  doubt that he stole the berries that were in the pail when he found it,  for he deliberately ate them. He knew well enough that some one must  have picked them--for whoever heard of blueberries growing in tin pails?  So there is no doubt that when Buster took them, he stole them. But with  the pail it was different. He took the pail, but he didn't mean to take  it. In fact, he didn't want that pail at all.    You see it was this way: When Buster found that big tin pail brimming  full of delicious berries in the shade of that big bush in the Old  Pasture, he didn't stop to think whether or not he had a right to them.  Buster is so fond of berries that from the very second that his greedy  little eyes saw that pailful, he forgot everything but the feast that  was waiting for him right under his very nose. He didn't think anything  about the right or wrong of helping himself. There before him were more  berries than he had ever seen together at one time in all his life, and  all he had to do was to eat and eat and eat. And that is just what he  did do. Of course he upset the pail, but he didn't mind a little thing  like that. When he had gobbled up all the berries that rolled out, he  thrust his nose into the pail to get all that were left in it. Just  then he heard a little noise, as if some one were coming. He threw up  his head to listen, and somehow, he never did know just how, the handle  of the pail slipped back over his ears and caught there.    This was bad enough, but to make matters worse, just at that very minute  he heard a shrill, angry voice shout, \"Hi, there! Get out of there!\" He  didn't need to be told whose voice that was. It was the voice of Farmer  Brown's boy. Right then and there Buster Bear nearly had a fit. There  was that awful pail fast over his head so that he couldn't see a thing.  Of course, that meant that he couldn't run away, which was the thing of  all things he most wanted to do, for big as he is and strong as he is,  Buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around. He growled  and whined and squealed. He tried to back out of the pail and couldn't.  He tried to shake it off and couldn't. He tried to pull it off, but  somehow he couldn't get hold of it. Then there was another yell. If  Buster hadn't been so frightened himself, he might have recognized that  second yell as one of fright, for that is what it was. You see Farmer  Brown's boy had just discovered Buster Bear. When he had yelled the  first time, he had supposed that it was one of the young cattle who live  in the Old Pasture all summer, but when he saw Buster, he was just as  badly frightened as Buster himself. In fact, he was too surprised and  frightened even to run. After that second yell he just stood still and  stared.    Buster clawed at that awful thing on his head more frantically than  ever. Suddenly it slipped off, so that he could see. He gave one  frightened look at Farmer Brown's boy, and then with a mighty \"Woof!\" he  started for the Green Forest as fast as his legs could take him, and  this was very fast indeed, let me tell you. He didn't stop to pick out a  path, but just crashed through the bushes as if they were nothing at  all, just nothing at all. But the funniest thing of all is this--he took  that pail with him! Yes, Sir, Buster Bear ran away with the big tin pail  of Farmer Brown's boy! You see when it slipped off his head, the handle  was still around his neck, and there he was running away with a pail  hanging from his neck! He didn't want it. He would have given anything  to get rid of it. But he took it because he couldn't help it. And that  brings us back to the question, did Buster steal Farmer Brown's boy's  pail? What do you think?          XXI    SAMMY JAY MAKES THINGS WORSE FOR BUSTER BEAR      \"Thief, thief, thief! Thief, thief, thief!\" Sammy Jay was screaming at  the top of his lungs, as he followed Buster Bear across the Old Pasture  towards the Green Forest. Never had he screamed so loud, and never had  his voice sounded so excited. The little people of the Green Forest, the  Green Meadows, and the Smiling Pool are so used to hearing Sammy cry  thief that usually they think very little about it. But every blessed  one who heard Sammy this morning stopped whatever he was doing and  pricked up his ears to listen.    Sammy's cousin, Blacky the Crow, just happened to be flying along the  edge of the Old Pasture, and the minute he heard Sammy's voice, he  turned and flew over to see what it was all about. Just as soon as he  caught sight of Buster Bear running for the Green Forest as hard as ever  he could, he understood what had excited Sammy so. He was so surprised  that he almost forgot to keep his wings moving. Buster Bear had what  looked to Blacky very much like a tin pail hanging from his neck! No  wonder Sammy was excited. Blacky beat his wings fiercely and started  after Sammy.    And so they reached the edge of the Green Forest, Buster Bear running as  hard as ever he could, Sammy Jay flying just behind him and screaming,  \"Thief, thief, thief!\" at the top of his lungs, and behind him Blacky  the Crow, trying to catch up and yelling as loud as he could, \"Caw,  caw, caw! Come on, everybody! Come on! Come on!\"    Poor Buster! It was bad enough to be frightened almost to death as he  had been up in the Old Pasture when the pail had caught over his head  just as Farmer Brown's boy had yelled at him. Then to have the handle of  the pail slip down around his neck so that he couldn't get rid of the  pail but had to take it with him as he ran, was making a bad matter  worse. Now to have all his neighbors of the Green Forest see him in such  a fix and make fun of him, was more than he could stand. He felt  humiliated. That is just another way of saying shamed. Yes, Sir, Buster  felt that he was shamed in the eyes of his neighbors, and he wanted  nothing so much as to get away by himself, where no one could see him,  and try to get rid of that dreadful pail. But Buster is so big that it  is not easy for him to find a hiding place. So, when he reached the  Green Forest, he kept right on to the deepest, darkest, most lonesome  part and crept under the thickest hemlock-tree he could find.    But it was of no use. The sharp eyes of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow  saw him. They actually flew into the very tree under which he was  hiding, and how they did scream! Pretty soon Ol' Mistah Buzzard came  dropping down out of the blue, blue sky and took a seat on a convenient  dead tree, where he could see all that went on. Ol' Mistah Buzzard began  to grin as soon as he saw that tin pail on Buster's neck. Then came  others,--Redtail the Hawk, Scrapper the Kingbird, Redwing the Blackbird,  Drummer the Woodpecker, Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the Chickadee, Jenny  Wren, Redeye the Vireo, and ever so many more. They came from the Old  Orchard, the Green Meadows, and even down by the Smiling Pool, for the  voices of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow carried far, and at the sound of  them everybody hurried over, sure that something exciting was going on.    Presently Buster heard light footsteps, and peeping out, he saw Billy  Mink and Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Prickly Porky and Reddy  Fox and Jimmy Skunk. Even timid little Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was  where he could peer out and see without being seen. Of course, Chatterer  the Red Squirrel and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were there. There they  all sat in a great circle around him, each where he felt safe, but where  he could see, and every one of them laughing and making fun of Buster.    \"Thief, thief, thief!\" screamed Sammy until his throat was sore. The  worst of it was Buster knew that everybody knew that it was true. That  awful pail was proof of it.    \"I wish I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22822"],[0,"The Superstitions of Witchcraft (#8)"],[1,"abandoned to the lowest, and, as a rule, to the oldest and  ugliest of the female sex. In the one case the proficient was the  master, in the other the slave, of the demons. (3) The position  of the female sex in the Western world has been always very  opposite to their status in the East, where women are believed to  be an inferior order of beings, and therefore incapable of an art  reserved for the superior endowments of the male sex. The modern  witchcraft may be traced to that perhaps oldest form of religious  conception, Fetishism, which still prevails in its utmost  horrors amongst the savage peoples in different parts of the  world. The early practice of magic was not dishonourable in its  origin, closely connected as it was with the study of natural  science--with astronomy and chymistry.    The magic system--interesting to us as having influenced the  later Jewish creed and mediately the Christian--referred like  most developed creeds to a particular founder, Zerdusht  (Zarathustra of the Zend), may have thus originated. Mankind, in  seeking a solution for that most interesting but unsatisfactory  problem, the cause of the predominance of evil on the earth, were  obliged by their ignorance and their fears to imagine, in  addition to the idea of a single supreme existence, the author  and source of good, antagonistic influence--the source and  representative of evil. Physical phenomena of every day  experience; the alternations of light and darkness, of sunshine  and clouds; the changes and oppositions in the outer world, would  readily supply an analogy to the moral world. Thus the dawn and  the sun, darkness and storms, in the wondering mind of the  earlier inhabitants of the globe, may have soon assumed the  substantial forms of personal and contending deities.[32] Such  seems to be the origin of the personifications in the Vedic hymns  of Indra and Vritra with their subordinate ministers (the Ormuzd  and Ahriman, &c., of the Zend-Avesta), and of the first religious  conceptions of other peoples. After this attempt to reconcile the  contradictions, the irregularities of nature, by establishing a  duality of gods whose respective provinces are the happiness and  unhappiness of the human race, the step was easy to the  conviction of the superior activity of a malignant god. The  benevolent but epicurean security of the first deity might seem  to have little concern in defeating or preventing the malicious  schemes of the other. All the infernal apparatus of later ages  was easy to be supplied by a delusive and an unreasoning  imagination.      [32] The despotism of language and its immense influence on    the destiny, as well as on the various opinions, of mankind,    is well shown by Professor Max Mueller. 'From one point of    view,' he declares, 'the true history of religion would be    neither more nor less than an account of the various    attempts at expressing the Inexpressible' (_Lectures on the    Science of Language_, Second Series). The witch-creed may be    indirectly referred, like many other absurdities, to the    perversion of language.          PART II.    MEDIAEVAL FAITH.          CHAPTER I.         Compromise between the New and the Old Faiths--Witchcraft       under the Early Church--The Sentiments of the Fathers and       the Decrees of Councils--Platonic Influences--Historical,       Physiological, and Accidental Causes of the Attribution of       Witchcraft to the Female Sex--Opinions of the Fathers and       other Writers--The Witch-Compact.      It might appear, in a casual or careless observation, surprising  that Christianity, whose original spirit, if not universal  practice, was to enlighten; whose professed mission was 'to  destroy the works of the devil,' failed to disprove as well as to  dispel some of the most pernicious beliefs of the pagan world:  that its final triumph within the limits of the Roman empire, or  as far as it extended without, was not attended by the extinction  of at least the most revolting practices of superstition.  Experience, and a more extended view of the progress of human  ideas, will teach that the growth of religious perception is  fitful and gradual: that the education of collective mankind  proceeds in the same way as that of the individual man. And thus,  in the expression of the biographer of Charles V., the barbarous  nations when converted to Christianity changed the object, not  the spirit, of their religious worship. Many of the ideas of the  old religion were consciously tolerated by the first propagators  of Christianity, who justly deemed that the new dogmas would be  more readily insinuated into the rude and simple minds of their  neophytes, if not too strictly uncompromising. Both past and  present facts testify to this compromise. It was a maxim with  some of the early promoters of the Christian cause, to do as  little violence as possible to existing prejudices[33]--a  judicious method still pursued by the Catholic, though condemned  by the Protestant, missionaries of the present day.[34] It was  not seldom that an entire nation was converted and christianised  by baptism almost in a single day: the mass of the people  accepting, or rather acquiescing in, the arguments of the  missionaries in submission to the will or example of their  prince, whose conduct they followed as they would have followed  him into the field. Such was the case at the conversion of the  Frankish chief Clovis, and of the Saxon Ethelbert. But if St.  Augustin or St. Boniface, and the earlier missionaries, had more  success in persuading the simple faith of the Germans, without a  written revelation and miracles, than the modern emissaries have  in inducing the Hindus to abandon their Vedas, it was easier to  convince them of the facts, than of the reason, of their faith.  Nor was it to be expected that such raw recruits (if the  expression may be allowed) should lay aside altogether prejudices  with which they were imbued from infancy.      [33] The remark of a late Professor of Divinity in the    University of Cambridge. 'The heathen temples,' says    Professor Blunt, 'became Christian churches; the altars of    the gods altars of the saints; the curtains, incense,    tapers, and votive-tablets remained the same; the    _aquaminarium_ was still the vessel for holy water; St.    Peter stood at the gate instead of Cardea; St. Rocque or St.    Sebastian in the bedroom instead of the Phrygian Penates;    St. Nicholas was the sign of the vessel instead of Castor    and Pollux; the Mater Deum became the Madonna; alms pro    Matre Deum became alms for the Madonna; the festival of the    Mater Deum the festival of the Madonna, or _Lady Day_; the    Hostia or victim was now the Host; the \"Lugentes Campi,\" or    dismal regions, Purgatory; the offerings to the Manes were    masses for the dead.' The parallel, he ventures to assert,    might be drawn out to a far greater extent, &c.      [34] Conformably to this plan, the first proselytisers in    Germany and the North were often reduced (we are told) to    substituting the name of Christ and the saints for those of    Odin and the gods in the toasts drunk at their bacchanalian    festivals.    The extent of the credit and practice of witchcraft under the  Church triumphant is evident from the numerous decrees and  anathemas of the Church in council, which, while oftener treating  it as a dread reality, has sometimes ventured to contemn or to  affect to contemn it as imposture and delusion. Both the civil  and ecclesiastical laws were exceptionally severe towards  _goetic_ practices. 'In all those laws of the Christian  emperors,' says Bingham, 'which granted indulgences to criminals  at the Easter festival, the _venefici_ and the _malefici_, that  is, magical practices against the lives of men, are always  excepted as guilty of too heinous a crime to be comprised within  the general pardon granted to other offenders.'[35] In earlier  ecclesiastical history, successive councils or synods are much  concerned in fulminating against them. The council of Ancyra  (314) prohibits the art under the name of pharmacy: a few years'  penance being appointed for anyone receiving a magician into his  house. St. Basil's canons, more severe, appoint thirty years as  the necessary atonement. Divination by lots or by consulting  their sacred scriptures, just as afterwards they consulted  Virgil, seems to have been a very favourite mode of discovering  the future. The clergy encouraged and traded upon this kind of  divination: in the Gallican church it was notorious. 'Some  reckon,' the pious author of the 'Antiquities of the Christian  Church' informs us, 'St. Augustin's conversion owing to such a  sort of consultation; but the thought is a great mistake, and  very injurious to him, for his conversion was owing to a  providential call, like that of St. Paul, from heaven.' And that  eminent saint's confessions are quoted to prove that his  conversion from the depths of vice and licentiousness to the  austere sobriety of his new faith, was indebted to a legitimate  use of the scriptures. St. Chrysostom upbraids his cotemporaries  for exposing the faith, by their illegitimate inquiries, to the  scorn of the heathen, many of whom where wiser than to hearken to  any such fond impostures.      [35] Bingham's _Origines Ecclesiasticae_, xvi.    St. Augustin complains that Satan's instruments, professing the  exercise of these arts, were used to 'set the name of Christ  before their ligatures, and enchantments, and other devices, to  seduce Christians to take the venomous bait under the covert of a  sweet and honey potion, that the bitter might be hid under the  sweet, and make men drink it without discerning to their  destruction.' The heretics of the primitive, as well as of the  middle, ages were accused of working miracles, and propagating  their accursed doctrines by magical or infernal art.
