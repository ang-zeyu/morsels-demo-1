Rents in their khaki  showed white skin; from their grimed hands and heads you might have  judged them half red men, half soot-black. Eyelids hung fat and heavy  over hollow cheeks and pointed cheekbones. Only {p.062} the eye  remained--the sky-blue, steel-keen, hard, clear, unconquerable English  eye--to tell that thirty-two miles without rest, four days without a  square meal, six nights--for many--without a stretch of sleep, still  found them soldiers at the end.    \"That was the beginning of them; but they were not all in till the  middle of the afternoon--which made thirty-six hours on their legs.  The Irish Fusiliers tramped in at lunch-time--going a bit short some  of them, nearly all a trifle stiff on the feet--but solid, square and  sturdy from the knees upward. They straightened up to the cheers that  met them, and stepped out on scorching feet as if they were ready to  go into action again on the instant. After them came the guns--not the  sleek creatures of Laffan's Plain, rough with earth and spinning mud  from their wheels, but war-worn and fresh from slaughter; you might  imagine their damp muzzles were dripping blood. You could count the  horses' ribs; they looked as if you could break them in half before  the quarters. But they, too, knew they were being cheered; they threw  their ears up and flung {p.063} all the weight left them into the  traces.    \"Through fire, water and earth, the Dundee column had come home  again.\"[3]    The undeniable error of placing an advanced detachment in Dundee had  thus been redeemed; at much material cost, it may be granted, but the  moral gain probably exceeded, and the gallant author of the mistake  paid for his error with his life. General Symons died in Dundee on the  day his column came in touch with the Ladysmith force.    In the ensuing week the Boers in largely superior numbers closed  rapidly down upon the now concentrated British, who on their part  strained every nerve to accumulate strength and resources, and to  secure time, by imposing caution and delay upon the enemy.    It was in an attempt of this kind that the disaster at Nicholson's Nek  was incurred. The enemy had appeared in great numerical strength upon  the hills, from three to five miles north of the town, and thence  round to the eastward, over a line of seven or eight miles. A  reconnaissance in force was planned for {p.064} Monday, October 30,  and in support of it, to secure the British left flank, a detachment  of a dozen companies of infantry with a mountain battery started at 11  P.M., Sunday, to march nearly due north, up the bed of a stream called  Bell's Spruit, to occupy the elevation known as Nicholson's Nek.  Advance along the broken, rock-strewn, and unfamiliar watercourse was  necessarily slow, but was unmolested until about two hours before  daybreak, when some boulders were rolled down from a neighbouring  height and fell among the mules of the battery, which was in the  middle of the column, preceded and followed by infantry. The terrified  creatures broke from their keepers, turned, and dashed in the darkness  through the rear of the division, where several shots were fired into  them by the startled soldiers, unable to see the character of the rush  they felt. Confusion necessarily ensued, and the panic spread to the  other ammunition animals, which stampeded. Order was with difficulty  restored, and the detachment, thus arrested, at daybreak found itself  still two miles short of its destination. It was not thought expedient  to {p.065} press on; and refuge, rather than position, was sought  upon a hill near by, which looked defensible, but upon climbing was  found to be commanded from several quarters. These were soon occupied  by the Boers, and after a resistance protracted to about 3 P.M., the  detachment was compelled to surrender. Something over a thousand men  were thus lost to the besieged, who could ill afford it. The  missing--mostly prisoners--amounted to 843. On the field 52 were found  dead, and 150 wounded were brought back to Ladysmith. Less than 100  escaped.                       [Footnote 3: \"From Cape Town to Ladysmith,\" p. 79.]    The rest of the British movement was successfully carried out, the  enemy retiring before them; but although all the troops were out,  except those absolutely needed for garrisoning the works, the enemy's  field bases--\"laagers\"--could not be reached. Their numbers and  dispositions so far made were observed; but the approaching  powerlessness of the British for decisive offensive action was also  shown. Upon returning to camp at 2 P.M., it was happily found that a  naval brigade from the cruiser \"Powerful,\" lying at Durban, {p.066}  had reached Ladysmith with long range and heavy guns. These were  quickly got into position and soon silenced a Boer 40-pounder, which  at daybreak had opened fire on the town from a hill between two and  three miles to the northward. A few hours later news came in of the  reverse at Nicholson's Nek.    The naval guns arrived in the nick of time, the very day that the  enemy got their first heavy piece at work, and but three days before  all communication with outside was intercepted. The closeness of the  shave emphasizes the military value of unremitting activity in doing,  and unremitting energy in retarding an opponent. At one end of the  line Talana Hill, Elandslaagte, Rietfontein; at the other, 200 miles  away, a naval division rushing guns ashore and to the railroad. The  result, a siege artillery opportunely mounted to keep the adversary at  distance.    \"The enemy's guns,\" telegraphed Sir George White, October 30, \"range  further than our field guns. I have now some naval guns, which have  temporarily silenced, and I hope {p.067} will permanently dominate,  the enemy's best guns, with which he has been bombarding the town at a  distance of over 6,000 yards.\" \"Our forces were seriously outnumbered  and our guns outranged\" (yesterday), wrote a correspondent in  Ladysmith, \"until the arrival of the naval brigade, who rendered  excellent service.\" \"The prompt assistance rendered by the Navy 190  miles inland has added immensely to the defensive strength of the  position, which now depends upon keeping down the enemy's artillery  fire. If the siege guns of the Boers can be controlled, the rifle fire  of a stout-hearted force ought to render a successful assault  impossible.\"    The naval guns were six--two 4.7 inch, and four long 12-pounders. They  were mounted on carriages hastily extemporised for the emergency by  Captain Percy Scott, of the Royal Navy, and, as they outranged the  army field guns by full 2,000 yards, they extended by at least double  that distance the diameter of the circle of investment imposed upon  the enemy.    On the 2nd of November telegraphic communication {p.068} between  Ladysmith and the outer world was broken, and the same day railroad  communication was intercepted; the last train out carrying General  French to take a cavalry command at Cape Town. The brief, exciting,  and brilliant prelude to the war was concluded, and a great and  controlling centre of national and military interest had been  established by the isolation of some 13,000 British in the midst of  foes whose numbers are not even yet accurately known, but of whose  great superiority in that respect there can be no doubt. For a hundred  and eighteen weary days the blockade lasted, until, on February 28,  1900, the advance of the relieving force entered the place.    Almost simultaneously with the beginning of the investment, on the  31st of October, General Sir Redvers Buller arrived from England at  Cape Town to take chief command of the British forces in South Africa.  The second period of the war now opened, before recounting which it  will be necessary to summarize the general situation at date, as  constituted by many preliminary occurrences in different, and {p.069}  even remote, quarters of the world. Up to the present, success had  seemed to lie with the Boers, but the appearance was only superficial.  Their plan had been well designed, but in execution it had failed; and  while the failure is to be laid in part to a certain tardiness and  lack of synchronism in their own movements, it was due yet more to the  well-judged, energetic, and brilliantly executed movements of Sir  George White and Sir Penn Symons, which utilised and completed the  dislocation in the enemy's action, and so insured the time necessary  for organising defence upon an adequately competent scale.    \"Sir George White's force,\" wrote Spencer Wilkinson, on the 18th  October, \"is the centre of gravity of the situation. If the Boers  cannot defeat it their case is hopeless; if they can crush it they may  have hopes of ultimate success.\"[4] The summary was true then, and is  now. In the preliminary trial of skill and strength the Boers had been  worsted.                       [Footnote 4: \"Lessons of the War,\" p. 13.]         NOTE.--The effective British force shut up in Ladysmith on       November 2 was 13,496, besides which there were 249 sick {p.070}       and wounded; total, 13,745. The Boer force in Natal is not       accurately known, but is roughly reckoned at double the British;       say 30,000. This estimate is probable, both from the extent of       their operations, and because they ought to have had at least so       many. It would be more to their discredit to have had fewer than       to fail with more. The non-military element in Ladysmith raised       the number of the besieged to about 21,000.          CHAPTER III {p.071}    THE COLONIES AND THE TRANSPORTS      In matters accessory to the War in South Africa, two stand  conspicuous, as worthy of note by such as interest themselves in  clearly comprehending those contemporary facts of which the import is  not merely local, but universal. As in all theatres of war, and in all  campaigns, there exist in South"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#8)"],[1,"  for ever. They were followers of Peter of Chelcic; they passed  his pamphlets in secret from hand to hand; they took down notes of  Rockycana's sermons; and now they resolved to practise what they heard.  If Peter had taught them nothing else, he had at least convinced them  all that the first duty of Christian men was to quit the Church of Rome.  Again and again they appealed to Rockycana to be their head, to act  up to his words, and to lead them out to the promised land. The great  orator hemmed and hawed, put them off with excuses, and told them, after  the manner of cowards, that they were too hasty and reckless. \"I know  you are right,\" said he, \"but if I joined your ranks I should be reviled  on every hand.\"[7] But these listeners were not to be cowed. The more  they studied Peter's writings, the more they lost faith in Rockycana.  As Rockycana refused to lead them, they left his church in a body, and  found a braver leader among themselves. His name was Gregory; he was  known as Gregory the Patriarch; and in due time, as we shall see, he  became the founder of the Church of the Brethren. He was already a  middle-aged man. He was the son of a Bohemian knight, and was nephew  to Rockycana himself. He had spent his youth in the Slaven cloister at  Prague as a bare-footed monk, had found the cloister not so moral as he  had expected, had left it in disgust, and was now well known in Bohemia  as a man of sterling character, pious and sensible, humble and strict,  active and spirited, a good writer and a good speaker. He was a personal  friend of Peter, had studied his works with care, and is said to have  been particularly fond of a little essay entitled \"The Image of the  Beast,\" which he had borrowed from a blacksmith in Wachovia. As time  went on he lost patience with Rockycana, came into touch with the little  societies at Wilenow and Divischau, visited Peter on his estate, and  gradually formed the plan of founding an independent society, and thus  doing himself what Rockycana was afraid to do. As soldiers desert a  cowardly general and rally round the standard of a brave one, so these  listeners in the old Thein Church fell away from halting Rockycana, and  rallied round Gregory the Patriarch. From all parts of Bohemia, from all  ranks of society, from all whom Peter's writings had touched, from all  who were disgusted with the Church of Rome, and who wished to see the  True Church of the Apostles bloom in purity and beauty again, from  all especially who desired the ministration of priests of moral  character--from all these was his little band recruited. How it all  happened we know not; but slowly the numbers swelled. At last the  terrible question arose: How and where must they live? The question  was one of life and death. Not always could they worship in secret; not  always be scattered in little groups. It was time, they said, to close  their ranks and form an army that should last. \"After us,\" Rockycana had  said in a sermon, \"shall a people come well-pleasing unto God and right  healthy for men; they shall follow the Scriptures, and the example of  Christ and the footsteps of the Apostles.\" And these stern men felt  called to the holy task.    In the year 1457, Uladislaus Postumus, King of Bohemia, died, and George  Podiebrad reigned in his stead; and about the same time it came to the  ears of Gregory the Patriarch that in the barony of Senftenberg, on the  north-east border of Bohemia, there lay a village that would serve as  a home for him and his trusty followers. And the village was called  Kunwald, and the old castle hard by was called Lititz. The village  was almost deserted, and only a few simple folk, of the same mind as  Gregory, lived there now. What better refuge could be found? Gregory  the Patriarch laid the scheme before his uncle Rockycana; Rockycana, who  sympathized with their views and wished to help them, brought the matter  before King George; the King, who owned the estate, gave his gracious  permission; and Gregory and his faithful friends wended their way to  Kunwald, and there began to form the first settlement of the Church of  the Brethren. And now many others from far and wide came to make Kunwald  their home. Some came from the Thein Church in Prague, some across the  Glatz Hills from Moravia, some from Wilenow, Divischau and Chelcic, some  from the Utraquist Church at Koeniggratz,[8] some, clothed and in their  right minds, from those queer folk, the Adamites, and some from little  Waldensian groups that lay dotted here and there about the land. There  were citizens from Prague and other cities. There were bachelors and  masters from the great University. There were peasants and nobles,  learned and simple, rich and poor, with their wives and children; and  thus did many, who longed to be pure and follow the Master and Him  alone, find a Bethany of Peace in the smiling little valley of Kunwald.    Here, then, in the valley of Kunwald, did these pioneers lay the  foundation stones of the Moravian Church {1457 or 1458.}.[9] They were  all of one heart and one mind. They honoured Christ alone as King;  they confessed His laws alone as binding. They were not driven from the  Church of Rome; they left of their own free will. They were men of deep  religious experience. As they mustered their forces in that quiet dale,  they knew that they were parting company from Church and State alike.  They had sought the guidance of God in prayer, and declared that their  prayers were answered. They had met to seek the truth of God, not from  priests, but from God Himself. \"As we knew not where to turn,\" they  wrote to Rockycana, \"we turned in prayer to God Himself, and besought  Him to reveal to us His gracious will in all things. We wanted to walk  in His ways; we wanted instruction in His wisdom; and in His mercy He  answered our prayers.\" They would rather, they said, spend weeks in gaol  than take the oath as councillors. They built cottages, tilled the land,  opened workshops, and passed their time in peace and quietness. For  a law and a testimony they had the Bible and the writings of Peter of  Chelcic. In Michael Bradacius, a Utraquist priest, they found a faithful  pastor. They made their own laws and appointed a body of twenty-eight  elders to enforce them. They divided themselves into three classes, the  Beginners, the Learners and the Perfect;[10] and the Perfect gave up their  private property for the good of the common cause. They had overseers to  care for the poor. They had priests to administer the sacraments, They  had godly laymen to teach the Scriptures. They had visitors to see to  the purity of family life. They were shut off from the madding crowd by  a narrow gorge, with the Glatz Mountains towering on the one side and  the hoary old castle of Lititz, a few miles off, on the other; and there  in that fruitful valley, where orchards smiled and gardens bloomed,  and neat little cottages peeped out from the woodland, they plied their  trades and read their Bibles, and kept themselves pure and unspotted  from the world under the eye of God Almighty.[11]  But it was not long before these Brethren had to show of what metal they  were made. With each other they were at peace, but in Bohemia the sea  still rolled from the storm. It is curious how people reasoned in those  days. As the Brethren used bread instead of wafer at the Holy Communion,  a rumour reached the ears of the King that they were dangerous  conspirators, and held secret meetings of a mysterious and unholy  nature. And King George held himself an orthodox King, and had sworn to  allow no heretics in his kingdom. As soon therefore, as he heard that  Gregory the Patriarch had come on a visit to Prague, and was actually  holding a meeting of University students in the New Town, he came down  upon them like a wolf on the fold, and gave orders to arrest them on the  spot. He was sure they were hatching a villainous plot of some kind. In  vain some friends sent warning to the students. They resolved, with a  few exceptions, to await their fate and stand to their guns. \"Come what  may,\" said they, in their fiery zeal, \"let the rack be our breakfast  and the funeral pile our dinner!\" The door of the room flew open. The  magistrate and his bailiffs appeared. \"All,\" said the magistrate, as  he stood at the threshold, \"who wish to live godly in Christ Jesus must  suffer persecution. Follow me to prison.\" They followed him, and were at  once stretched upon the rack. As soon as the students felt the pain of  torture their courage melted like April snow. After they had tasted the  breakfast they had no appetite for the dinner. They went in a body to  the Thein Church, mounted the pulpit one by one, pleaded guilty to the  charges brought against them, and confessed, before an admiring crowd,  their full belief in all the dogmas of the Holy Church of Rome. But for  Gregory the Patriarch, who was now growing old, the pain was too severe.  His wrists cracked; he swooned, and was thought to be dead, and in his  swoon he dreamed a dream which seemed to him like the dreams of the  prophets of old. He saw, in a lovely meadow, a tree laden with fruit;  the fruit was being plucked by birds; the flights of the birds were  guided by a youth of heavenly beauty, and the tree was guarded by three  men whose faces he seemed to know. What meant that dream to Gregory and  his Brethren? It was a vision of the good time coming. The tree was the  Church of the Brethren. The fruit was her Bible teaching. The birds were  her ministers and helpers. The youth of radiant beauty was the Divine  Master Himself. And the three men who stood on guard were the three men  who were afterwards chosen as the first three Elders of the Brethren's  Church.    While Gregory lay in his swoon, his old teacher, his uncle, his sometime  friend, John Rockycana, hearing that he was dying, came to see him.  His conscience was stricken, his heart bled,"]]]
