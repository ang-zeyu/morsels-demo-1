Then he thought how foolish it  was to wish for something he hadn't got and couldn't have.    \"'The thing to do,' said little Mr. Squirrel to himself, 'is to make the  most of what I have got. Now I am a pretty good jumper, but if I keep  jumping, perhaps I can learn to jump better than I do now.'    \"So every night Mr. Squirrel used to go off by himself, where he was  sure no one would see him, and practise jumping. He would climb an old  stump and then jump as far as he could. Then he would do it all over  again ever so many times, and after a little he found that he went  farther, quite a little farther, than when he began. Then one night he  made a discovery. He found that by spreading his arms and legs out just  as far as possible and making himself as flat as he could, he could go  almost twice as far as he had been able to go before, and he landed a  great deal easier. It was like sliding down on the air. It was great  fun, and pretty soon he was spending all his spare time doing it.    \"One moonlight night, Old Mother Nature happened along and sat down on a  log to watch him. Little Mr. Squirrel didn't see her, and when at last  she asked him what he was doing, he was so surprised and confused that  he could hardly find his tongue. At last he told her that he was trying  to learn to jump better that he might better take care of himself. The  idea pleased Old Mother Nature. You know she is always pleased when she  finds people trying to help themselves.    \"'That's a splendid idea,' said she. 'I'll help you. I'll make you the  greatest jumper in the Green Forest.'    \"Then she gave to little Mr. Squirrel something almost but not quite  like wings. Between his fore legs and hind legs on each side she  stretched a piece of skin that folded right down against his body when  he was walking or running so as to hardly show and wasn't in the way at  all.    \"'Now,' said she, 'climb that tall tree over yonder clear to the top and  then jump with all your might for that tree over there across that open  place.'    \"It was ten times as far as little Mr. Squirrel ever had jumped before,  and the tree was so tall that he felt sure that he would break his neck  when he struck the ground. He was afraid, very much afraid. But Old  Mother Nature had told him to do it. He knew that he ought to trust her.  So he climbed the tall tree. It was a frightful distance down to the  ground, and that other tree was so far away that it was foolish to even  think of reaching it.    \"'Jump!' commanded Old Mother Nature.    \"Little Mr. Squirrel gulped very hard, trying to swallow his fear. Then  he jumped with all his might, and just as he had taught himself to do,  spread himself out as flat as he could. Just imagine how surprised he  was and how tickled when he just coasted down on the air clear across  the open place and landed as lightly as a feather on the foot of that  distant tree! You see, the skin between his legs when he spread them out  had kept him from falling straight down. Of course if he hadn't jumped  with all his might, as Old Mother Nature had told him to, even though he  thought it wouldn't be of any use, he wouldn't have reached that other  tree.    \"He was so delighted that he wanted to do it right over again, but he  didn't forget his manners. He first thanked Old Mother Nature.    \"She smiled. 'See that you keep out of danger, for that is why I have  made you the greatest jumper in the Green Forest,' said she.    \"Little Mr. Squirrel did. People who, like Peter, did not use their  eyes, thought that he could fly, and he was called the Flying Squirrel.  He was the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Timmy whom you both  know.\"    \"And Timmy doesn't really fly at all, does he?\" asked Jimmy Skunk.    \"Certainly not. He jumps and slides on the air,\" replied Grandfather  Frog.    \"What did I tell you?\" cried Jimmy triumphantly to Peter.    \"Well, anyway, it's next thing to flying. I wish I could do it,\" replied  Peter.                                           IX                       HOW MR. WEASEL WAS MADE AN OUTCAST                                           IX                       HOW MR. WEASEL WAS MADE AN OUTCAST      Chatterer the Red Squirrel peered down from the edge of an old nest  built long ago in a big hemlock-tree in the Green Forest, and if you  could have looked into Chatterer's eyes, you would have seen there a  great fear. He looked this way; he looked that way. Little by little,  the fear left him, and when at last he saw Peter Rabbit coming his way,  he gave a little sigh of relief and ran down the tree. Peter saw him and  headed straight toward him to pass the time of day.    \"Peter,\" whispered Chatterer, as soon as Peter was near enough to hear,  \"have you seen Shadow the Weasel?\"    It was Peter's turn to look frightened, and he hastily glanced this way  and that way. \"No,\" he replied. \"Is he anywhere about here?\"    \"I saw him pass about five minutes ago, but he seemed to be in a hurry,  and I guess he has gone now,\" returned Chatterer, still whispering.    \"I hope so! My goodness, I hope so!\" exclaimed Peter, still looking this  way and that way uneasily.    \"I hate him!\" declared Chatterer fiercely.    \"So do I,\" replied Peter. \"I guess everybody does. It must be dreadful  to be hated by everybody. I don't believe he has got a single friend in  the wide, wide world, not even among his own relatives. I wonder why it  is he never tries to make any friends.\"    \"Here comes Jimmy Skunk. Let's ask him. He ought to know, for he is  Shadow's cousin,\" said Chatterer.    Jimmy came ambling up in his usual lazy way, for you know he never  hurries. It seemed to Chatterer and Peter that he was slower than usual.  But he got there at last.    \"Why is it, Jimmy Skunk, that your cousin, Shadow the Weasel, never  tries to make any friends?\" cried Chatterer, as soon as Jimmy was near  enough.    \"I've never asked him, but I suppose it's because he doesn't want them,\"  replied Jimmy.    \"But why?\" asked Peter.    \"I guess it's because he is an outcast,\" replied Jimmy.    \"What is an outcast,\" demanded Peter.    \"Why, somebody with whom nobody else will have anything to do, stupid,\"  replied Jimmy. \"I thought everybody knew that.\"    \"But how did it happen that he became an outcast in the first place?\"  persisted Peter.    \"He's always been an outcast, ever since he was born, and I suppose he  is used to it,\" declared Jimmy. \"His father was an outcast, and his  grandfather, and his great-grandfathers way back to the days when the  world was young.\"    \"Tell us about it. Do tell us about it!\" begged Peter.    Jimmy smiled good-naturedly. \"Well, seeing that I haven't anything else  to do just now, I will. Perhaps you fellows may learn something from the  story,\" said he. Then he settled himself comfortably with his back to an  old stump and began.    [Illustration: \"One day Mr. Rabbit surprised Mr. Weasel making a meal of  young mice.\" _Page_ 124.]        \"When old King Bear ruled in the forest long, long ago, and the  great-great-ever-so-great-grandfathers of all of us and of everybody  else lived in peace and happiness with each other, slim, trim, spry Mr.  Weasel lived with the rest. He was small, just as Shadow is now, and he  looked just the same as Shadow does now. He was on the best of terms  with all his neighbors, and no one had a word to say against him. In  fact, he was rather liked and had quite as many friends as anybody. But  all the time he had a mean disposition. He hid it from his neighbors,  but he had it just the same. Now mean dispositions are easily hidden  when everything is pleasant and there are no worries, and that is the  way it was then. No one suspected any one else of meanness, for with  plenty to eat and nothing to worry about, there was no cause for  meanness.    \"With his mean disposition, Mr. Weasel was also very crafty. Being  small and moving so swiftly, he was hard to keep track of. You know how  it is with Shadow--now you see him, and now you don't.\"    Chatterer and Peter nodded. They knew that it is because of this that he  is called Shadow.    \"Well,\" continued Jimmy, \"it didn't take him long to find that if he  were careful, he could go where he pleased, and no one would be the  wiser. They say that he used to practise dodging out of sight when he  saw any one coming, and after a while he got so that he could disappear  right under the very noses of his neighbors. Being so slim, he could go  where any of his four-footed neighbors could, and it wasn't long before  he knew all about every hole and nook and corner anywhere around. There  were no secrets that he didn't find out, and all the time no one  suspected him.    \"Of course hard times came to Mr. Weasel at last, just as to everybody  else, but they didn't worry him much. You see, he knew all about the  secret hiding-places in which some of his neighbors had stored away  food, so when he was hungry, all he had to do was to help himself. So  Mr. Weasel became a thief, and still no one suspected him. Now one bad  habit almost always leads to another. Mr. Weasel developed a great  fondness for eggs. Our whole family has always had rather a weakness  that way.\"    Jimmy grinned, for he knew that Peter and Chatterer knew that he himself  never could pass a fresh egg when he found it.    \"One day he found a nest in which were four little baby birds instead  of the eggs he had been expecting to find there and, having a mean  disposition, he flew into a rage and killed those four little birds.  Yes, Sir, that's what he did. He found the taste of young birds very  much to his liking, and he began to hunt for more. Then he discovered a  nest of young mice, and he found these quite as good as young birds.  Then came a great fear upon the littlest people, but not once did they  suspect Mr. Weasel. He was very crafty and went and came among them just  as always.

Snowflakes are falling      So gentle and slow,     Youngster says, 'Frying Pan,      What makes it snow?'     Frying Pan confident      Makes the reply --     'Shake 'em big flour bag      Up in the sky!'     'What! when there's miles of it!      Sur'ly that's brag.     Who is there strong enough      Shake such a bag?'     'What parson tellin' you,      Ole Mister Dodd,     Tell you in Sunday-school?      Big feller God!     He drive His bullock dray,      Then thunder go,     He shake His flour bag --      Tumble down snow!'          The Two Devines           It was shearing-time at the Myall Lake,      And there rose the sound thro' the livelong day     Of the constant clash that the shear-blades make      When the fastest shearers are making play,     But there wasn't a man in the shearers' lines     That could shear a sheep with the two Devines.       They had rung the sheds of the east and west,      Had beaten the cracks of the Walgett side,     And the Cooma shearers had giv'n them best --      When they saw them shear, they were satisfied.     From the southern slopes to the western pines     They were noted men, were the two Devines.       'Twas a wether flock that had come to hand,      Great struggling brutes, that the shearers shirk,     For the fleece was filled with the grass and sand,      And seventy sheep was a big day's work.     'At a pound a hundred it's dashed hard lines     To shear such sheep,' said the two Devines.       But the shearers knew that they'd make a cheque      When they came to deal with the station ewes;     They were bare of belly and bare of neck      With a fleece as light as a kangaroo's.     'We will show the boss how a shear-blade shines     When we reach those ewes,' said the two Devines.       But it chanced next day when the stunted pines      Were swayed and stirred with the dawn-wind's breath,     That a message came for the two Devines      That their father lay at the point of death.     So away at speed through the whispering pines     Down the bridle track rode the two Devines.       It was fifty miles to their father's hut,      And the dawn was bright when they rode away;     At the fall of night when the shed was shut      And the men had rest from the toilsome day,     To the shed once more through the dark'ning pines     On their weary steeds came the two Devines.       'Well, you're back right sudden,' the super. said;      'Is the old man dead and the funeral done?'     'Well, no, sir, he ain't not exactly dead,      But as good as dead,' said the eldest son --     'And we couldn't bear such a chance to lose,     So we came straight back to tackle the ewes.'           .   .   .   .   .       They are shearing ewes at the Myall Lake,      And the shed is merry the livelong day     With the clashing sound that the shear-blades make      When the fastest shearers are making play,     And a couple of 'hundred and ninety-nines'     Are the tallies made by the two Devines.          In the Droving Days           'Only a pound,' said the auctioneer,     'Only a pound; and I'm standing here     Selling this animal, gain or loss.     Only a pound for the drover's horse;     One of the sort that was never afraid,     One of the boys of the Old Brigade;     Thoroughly honest and game, I'll swear,     Only a little the worse for wear;     Plenty as bad to be seen in town,     Give me a bid and I'll knock him down;     Sold as he stands, and without recourse,     Give me a bid for the drover's horse.'       Loitering there in an aimless way     Somehow I noticed the poor old grey,     Weary and battered and screwed, of course,     Yet when I noticed the old grey horse,     The rough bush saddle, and single rein     Of the bridle laid on his tangled mane,     Straightway the crowd and the auctioneer     Seemed on a sudden to disappear,     Melted away in a kind of haze,     For my heart went back to the droving days.       Back to the road, and I crossed again     Over the miles of the saltbush plain --     The shining plain that is said to be     The dried-up bed of an inland sea,     Where the air so dry and so clear and bright     Refracts the sun with a wondrous light,     And out in the dim horizon makes     The deep blue gleam of the phantom lakes.       At dawn of day we would feel the breeze     That stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees,     And brought a breath of the fragrance rare     That comes and goes in that scented air;     For the trees and grass and the shrubs contain     A dry sweet scent on the saltbush plain.     For those that love it and understand,     The saltbush plain is a wonderland.     A wondrous country, where Nature's ways     Were revealed to me in the droving days.       We saw the fleet wild horses pass,     And the kangaroos through the Mitchell grass,     The emu ran with her frightened brood     All unmolested and unpursued.     But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub     When the dingo raced for his native scrub,     And he paid right dear for his stolen meals     With the drover's dogs at his wretched heels.     For we ran him down at a rattling pace,     While the packhorse joined in the stirring chase.     And a wild halloo at the kill we'd raise --     We were light of heart in the droving days.       'Twas a drover's horse, and my hand again     Made a move to close on a fancied rein.     For I felt the swing and the easy stride     Of the grand old horse that I used to ride     In drought or plenty, in good or ill,     That same old steed was my comrade still;     The old grey horse with his honest ways     Was a mate to me in the droving days.       When we kept our watch in the cold and damp,     If the cattle broke from the sleeping camp,     Over the flats and across the plain,     With my head bent down on his waving mane,     Through the boughs above and the stumps below     On the darkest night I could let him go     At a racing speed; he would choose his course,     And my life was safe with the old grey horse.     But man and horse had a favourite job,     When an outlaw broke from a station mob,     With a right good will was the stockwhip plied,     As the old horse raced at the straggler's side,     And the greenhide whip such a weal would raise,     We could use the whip in the droving days.           .   .   .   .   .       'Only a pound!' and was this the end --     Only a pound for the drover's friend.     The drover's friend that had seen his day,     And now was worthless, and cast away     With a broken knee and a broken heart     To be flogged and starved in a hawker's cart.     Well, I made a bid for a sense of shame     And the memories dear of the good old game.       'Thank you?  Guinea! and cheap at that!     Against you there in the curly hat!     Only a guinea, and one more chance,     Down he goes if there's no advance,     Third, and the last time, one! two! three!'     And the old grey horse was knocked down to me.     And now he's wandering, fat and sleek,     On the lucerne flats by the Homestead Creek;     I dare not ride him for fear he'd fall,     But he does a journey to beat them all,     For though he scarcely a trot can raise,     He can take me back to the droving days.          Lost           'He ought to be home,' said the old man, 'without there's something amiss.     He only went to the Two-mile -- he ought to be back by this.     He _WOULD_ ride the Reckless filly, he _WOULD_ have his wilful way;     And, here, he's not back at sundown -- and what will his mother say?       'He was always his mother's idol, since ever his father died;     And there isn't a horse on the station that he isn't game to ride.     But that Reckless mare is vicious, and if once she gets away     He hasn't got strength to hold her -- and what will his mother say?'       The old man walked to the sliprail, and peered up the dark'ning track,     And looked and longed for the rider that would never more come back;     And the mother came and clutched him, with sudden, spasmodic fright:     'What has become of my Willie? -- why isn't he home to-night?'       Away in the gloomy ranges, at the foot of an ironbark,     The bonnie, winsome laddie was lying stiff and stark;     For the Reckless mare had smashed him against a leaning limb,     And his comely face was battered, and his merry eyes were dim.       And the thoroughbred chestnut filly, the saddle beneath her flanks,     Was away like fire through the ranges to join the wild mob's ranks;     And a broken-hearted woman and an old man worn and grey     Were searching all night in the ranges till the sunrise brought the day.       And the mother kept feebly calling, with a hope that would not die,     'Willie! where are you, Willie?'  But how can the dead reply;     And hope died out with the daylight, and the darkness brought despair,     God pity the stricken mother, and answer the widow's prayer!       Though far and wide they sought him, they found not where he fell;     For the ranges held him precious, and guarded their treasure well.     The wattle blooms above him, and the blue bells blow close by,     And the brown bees buzz the secret, and the wild birds sing reply.       But the mother pined and faded, and cried, and took no rest,     And rode each day to the ranges on her hopeless, weary quest.     Seeking her loved one ever, she faded and pined away,     But with strength of her great affection she still sought every day.       'I know that sooner or later I shall find my boy,' she said.     But she came not home one evening, and they found her lying dead,     And stamped on the poor pale features, as the spirit homeward"]]]
