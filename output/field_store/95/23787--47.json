Notwithstanding the uninterrupted success of the British arms, Lord Bute  was still anxious for peace. And his views at this time were seconded by  the voice of the people, who loudly complained of the increased taxation  and the expenses and burdens consequent upon this protracted war.  Accordingly, having indirectly sounded some of the French cabinet, Bute  engaged the neutral King of Sardinia to propose that it should resume  negociations for peace. Both France and Spain, taught experience by  their reverses, were eager for such a consummation; and Louis XV. had no  sooner received the hint, than he acted upon it with all his heart and  soul. Notes were interchanged, and it was agreed that a minister  should be appointed on either side forthwith. In compliance with this  agreement, the Duke of Bedford went as plenipotentiary and ambassador  extraordinary to Paris, and the Duke de Nivernois came over to London in  the same capacity. Preliminaries for peace were signed at Fontainbleau,  on the third of November, by the ministers of Great Britain, France,  Spain, and Portugal; and the sanction of the British parliament only was  wanting to carry them into effect.    The terms of the preliminaries signed at Fontainbleau were as  follow:--France consented to restore Minorca; to evacuate Hanover,  Cleves, Wesel, Gueldres, the territories of the Landgrave of Hesse, the  Duke of Brunswick, and the Count de la Lippe Bucke-burg, and every place  taken from his Prussian majesty. France, also, renounced all pretensions  to Nova Scotia, and ceded the islands of Cape Breton and St. John, with  the entire province of Canada, including the islands in the Gulf and  River of St. Lawrence; that part of Louisiana which is situate east of  the Mississippi, and the tract between the Ohio and St. Lawrence, on  which French forts had been erected, and which had been the proximate  cause of the war. On her part Spain resigned East and West Florida, with  all pretensions to fish on the coast of Newfoundland; and conceded the  full right of cutting logwood in the Bay of Honduras. France and Spain  promised full restitution to Portugal, and the fortifications of Dunkirk  were to be demolished, according to the tenor of previous treaties. For  these advantages, England agreed to restore Pondicherry, in the East  Indies, Goree, in Africa, and Martinique, Guadaloupe, Mari-galante,  Desirade, and St. Lucie, in the West Indies, to France, together with  Belleisle, in Europe. To Spain she was to give up the Havannah, with all  other conquests in Cuba, The conquests England retained, beside those  specified in the preliminaries, were Senegal, in Africa, and St.  Vincent, Dominique, Tobago, Grenada, and the Grenadines, in the West  Indies. On the whole, England would evidently become a great gainer; but  the terms gave rise to great contention, and a struggle of party on the  meeting of Parliament.          THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT AND THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE.    Although the great body of the people of England desired peace,  yet there was a section of the community equally desirous for the  continuance of the war. The citizens of London had largely profited by  it; and during the negociations of last year they had instructed their  representatives to oppose any peace which did not reserve to England  all, or the greater part, of their conquests. This feeling was  heightened by the successes of the last campaign, and while the whole  glory of the war was assigned by them to Pitt, the very name of peace  was considered as a sacrifice of the national honour. Encouraged by  these feelings, Pitt organised a party in opposition to the cabinet, and  he was aided in this by many of the Whigs, who, irritated by the removal  of so many of their adherents from office, looked with jealousy upon the  actions of the favourite minister, Bute. The premier, likewise, was very  unpopular with the people, for although his views of peace coincided  with their own, yet he lacked the genius which could alone command  their admiration; and his cold, formal manners, and known lust of power,  subjected him to their scorn and contempt.    Parliament met on the 25th of November, and the preliminaries of peace  were then laid before both houses for their decision. In his opening  speech, his majesty remarked upon this subject:--\"It was impossible to  execute what this nation has so gloriously performed in all parts of the  world, without the loss of great numbers of men. When you consider this  loss, whether on the principles of policy or humanity, you will see one  of the many reasons which induced me to enter early into negociation,  so as to make considerable progress in it before the fate of many  operations was determined; and now, to hasten the conclusion of it, to  prevent the necessity of making preparations for another campaign. As by  this peace my territories are greatly augmented, and new sources opened  for trades and manufactures, it is my earnest desire that you would  consider of such methods, in the settlements of our new acquisitions, as  shall most effectually tend to the security of those countries, and  to the improvement of the commerce and navigation of Great Britain. I  cannot mention our acquisitions without earnestly recommending to your  care and attention my gallant subjects, by whose valour they were made.  We could never have carried on this extensive war without the greatest  union at home. You will find the same union peculiarly necessary in  order to make the best use of the great advantages acquired by the  peace, and to lay the foundation of that economy which we owe to  ourselves and to our posterity, and which can alone relieve this nation  from the heavy burdens brought on it by the necessities of this long and  expensive war.\"    There were points in this pacific speech of his majesty which were  perfectly unanswerable. Humanity, and the burdens of the country  demanded that the sword should be sheathed, and the demand was  eloquently seconded by the great advantages which England would secure  by the peace. Notwithstanding, opposition was not disarmed, and a fierce  war of words ensued. The motion for an address in the house of commons,  approving of the terms of the treaty, was moved by Mr. Fox, Pitt's  ancient rival, who still retained the lucrative place of paymaster of  the forces. Pitt followed on the opposite side. He came to the house,  suffering from gout and wrapped up in flannel; but, nevertheless,  supported by two members, in an elaborate argument of more than three  hours, he advanced every objection that could be urged against the  negociations. The whole tenor of the treaty was denounced by him as  unsound and impolitic, and as derogatory to the honour of England. He  came, he said, at the hazard of his life to the house that day, to lift  up his voice, his hand, and his arm against the preliminary articles of  a treaty which obscured all the glories of the war, surrendered up  the interests of the nation, and sacrificed the public faith by the  abandonment of long-tried and faithful allies. Fox, supported by George  Grenville, replied in a less eloquent; tone, but with more cogent  arguments, and the ministers obtained a large majority. In the house of  lords, Bute undertook the defence of the measure, and in his speech,  the clauses of which fell from his lips like so many minute-guns, he  detailed the rise and progress of the negociations at large, and set  forth the advantages which England would derive from the treaty in  the best manner his talents for oratory--which were very mean--would  permit. He concluded his speech with declaring, that he desired no other  epitaph to be inscribed on his tomb, than that he was the adviser of  such a peace. He was opposed by Lord Temple, and supported by the Earl  of Halifax; and notwithstanding all the arguments of the opposing peers,  the address was carried by a large majority. The treaty was therefore  signed, and commercial communications, which had been stopped during the  war, were reopened with France.    Pitt had declared in his speech, that the desertion of the King of  Prussia, England's most magnanimous ally, was insidious, base, and  treacherous. A glance at the preliminaries will suffice to prove that  Frederick's interests were not forgotten. Frederick, moreover, was now  in a condition to defend himself. At this very time, in fact, he had  induced all the princes and states in Germany to sign a declaration of  neutrality, which led first to a truce between Austria and Prussia,  then to a congress, and finally, in that congress, to a treaty of peace  between Austria, Prussia, Saxony, and Poland. This treaty was not signed  till the 15th of February, 1763, but its terms were agreed upon before  the close of the present year. Frederick retained Silesia, and all the  territories that belonged to him before the war, and the other powers  were compelled to rest satisfied with their legitimate possessions,  without the slightest reparation for the damages they had endured, and  the sums they had spent, during this dream of their ambition. Thus ended  this Seven Years' War--a war which had cost millions of lives, and in  which a large portion of Europe was devastated, and carnage was earned  into every quarter of the globe. England was a gainer by it, but her  acquisitions cost so much blood, and treasures, that it may fairly be  questioned whether her advantages were commensurate with the price she  paid for them.          THE RESIGNATION OF BUTE.    Notwithstanding the large majority ministers had obtained in both houses  of parliament on the subject of the newly-signed treaty, causes were at  work which soon effected their overthrow.

I often hear a sound    As if a stranger tried    To enter here, but found    The door made fast inside.

ARGUS        When wise Ulysses, from his native coast    Long kept by wars, and long by tempests tost,    Arrived at last--poor, old, despised, alone,    To all his friends, and e'en his queen, unknown,    Changed as he was, with age, and toils, and cares,    Furrowed his rev'rend face, and white his hairs,    In his own palace forced to ask his bread,    Scorned by those slaves his former bounty fed,    Forgot of all his own domestic crew,    His faithful dog his rightful master knew!      Unfed, unhoused, neglected, on the clay    Like an old servant, now cashiered, he lay;    And though ev'n then expiring on the plain,    Touched with resentment of ungrateful man,    And longing to behold his ancient lord again,    Him when he saw, he rose, and crawled to meet    ('Twas all he could), and fawned, and kissed his feet,    Seized with dumb joy; then falling by his side,    Owned his returning lord, looked up, and died.        ALEXANDER POPE.            CHAINED IN THE YARD        'Twas only a dog in a kennel      And little noise he made,    But it seemed to me as I heard it      I knew what that old dog said.      \"Another long month to get over;      Will nobody loosen my chain?    Just for a run 'round the meadow,      Then fasten me up again.      \"Give me my old life of freedom,      Give me a plunge and a swim,    A dash and a dive in the river,      A shake and a splash on the brim.\"      I patted his head and spoke kindly,      I thought that his case was hard,    Oh, give him a run in the open,      Your dog chained up in the yard!

WHY THE DOG'S NOSE IS COLD        \"What makes the dog's nose always cold?\"    I'll try to tell you, curls of gold,    If you will sit upon my knee    And very good and quiet be.      Well, years and years and years ago--    How many I don't really know--    There came a rain on sea and shore;    Its like was never seen before    Or since. It fell unceasing down    Till all the world began to drown.      But just before it down did pour,    An old, old man--his name was Noah--    Built him an ark, that he might save    His family from a watery grave;    And in it also he designed    To shelter two of every kind    Of beast. Well, dear, when it was done,    And heavy clouds obscured the sun,    The Noah folks to it quickly ran,    And then the animals began    To gravely march along in pairs.      The leopards, tigers, wolves and bears,    The deer, the hippopotamuses,    The rabbits, squirrels, elks, walruses,    The camels, goats, and cats, and donkeys,    The tall giraffes, the beavers, monkeys,    The rats, the big rhinoceroses,    The dromedaries and the horses,    The sheep, the mice, the kangaroos,    Hyenas, elephants, koodoos,    And many more--'twould take all day,    My dear, the very names to say--    And at the very, very end    Of the procession, by his friend    And master, faithful dog was seen.      The lifelong time he'd helping been    To drive the crowd of creatures in;    And now, with loud, exultant bark,    He gayly sprang aboard the bark.      Alas! So crowded was the space    He could not in it find a place;    So, patiently, he turned about,--    Stood half-way in, and half-way out,    And those extremely heavy showers    Descended through nine hundred hours    And more; and, darling, at their close    Most frozen was his honest nose;    And never could it lose again    The dampness of that dreadful rain.      And that is what, my curls of gold,    Made all the doggies' noses cold.        MARGARET EYTINGE.            DOG LANGUAGE        Our Towser is the finest dog that ever wore a collar,    We wouldn't sell him--no, indeed--not even for a dollar!    I understand his language now, 'cause honest, it appears    That dogs can talk, and say a lot, with just their tails and ears.      When I come home from school he meets me with a joyous bound,    And shakes that long tail sideways, down and up, and round and round.    Pa says he's going to hang a rug beside the door to see    If Towser will not beat it while he's busy greeting me.      Then when he sees me get my hat, but thinks he cannot go,    His ears get limp, his tail drops down, and he just walks off--slow;    Though if I say the magic words: \"Well, Towser, want to come?\"    Why, say! You'd know he answered \"Yes,\" although at speech he's dumb.        MARION HOVEY BRIGGS.            A DOG'S LOYALTY                            Many a good    And useful quality, and virtue, too.

She's a rum-lookin' bitch, that I own to, and there is a fierce look in her eyes,    But if any cove says as she's vicious, I sez in his teeth he lies.    Soh! Gently, old 'ooman; come here, now, and set by my side on the bed;    I wonder who'll have yer, my beauty, when him as you're all to 's dead.    There, stow yer palaver a minit; I knows as my end is nigh;    Is a cove to turn round on his dog, like, just 'cos he's goin' to die?      Oh, of course, I was sartin you'd say it. It's allus the same with you.    Give it us straight, now, guv'nor--what would you have me do?    Think of my soul? I do, sir. Think of my Saviour? Right!    Don't be afeard of the bitch, sir; she's not a-goin' to bite.    Tell me about my Saviour--tell me that tale agen,    How he prayed for the coves as killed him, and died for the worst of men.    It's a tale as I always liked, sir; and bound for the 'ternal shore,    I thinks it aloud to myself, sir, and I likes it more and more.      I've thumbed it out in the Bible, and I know it now by heart,    And it's put the steam in my boiler, and made me ready to start.    I ain't not afraid to die now; I've been a bit bad in my day,    But I know when I knock at them portals there's one as won't say me nay.    And it's thinkin' about that story, and all as he did for us,    As make me so fond o' my dawg, sir; especially now I'm wus;    For a-savin' o' folks who'd kill us is a beautiful act, the which    I never heard tell on o' no one, 'cept o' him and o' that there bitch.      'Twas five years ago come Chrismus, maybe you remember the row,    There was scares about hydryphoby--same as there be just now;    And the bobbies came down on us costers--came in a reggerlar wax,    And them as 'ud got no license was summerned to pay the tax.    But I had a friend among 'em, and he come in a friendly way,    And he sez, 'You must settle your dawg, Bill, unless you've a mind to pay.'    The missus was dyin' wi' fever--I'd made a mistake in my pitch,    I couldn't afford to keep her, so I sez, 'I'll drownd the bitch.'      I wasn't a-goin' to lose her, I warn't such a brute, you bet,    As to leave her to die by inches o' hunger, and cold, and wet;    I never said now't to the missus--we both on us liked her well--    But I takes her the follerin' Sunday down to the Grand Canell.    I gets her tight by the collar--the Lord forgive my sin!    And, kneelin' down on the towpath, I ducks the poor beast in.    She gave just a sudden whine like, then a look comes into her eyes    As 'ull last forever in mine, sir, up to the day I dies.      And a chill came over my heart then, and thinkin' I heard her moan,    I held her below the water, beating her skull with a stone.    You can see the mark of it now, sir--that place on the top of 'er 'ed--    And sudden she ceased to struggle, and I fancied as she was dead.    I shall never know how it happened, but goin' to lose my hold,    My knees slipped over the towpath, and into the stream I rolled;    Down like a log I went, sir, and my eyes were filled with mud,    And the water was tinged above me with a murdered creeter's blood.      I gave myself up for lost then, and I cursed in my wild despair,    And sudden I rose to the surfis, and a su'thing grabbed at my hair,    Grabbed at my hair and loosed it, and grabbed me agin by the throat,    And she was a-holdin' my 'ed up, and somehow I kep' afloat.    I can't tell yer 'ow she done it, for I never knowed no more    Till somebody seized my collar, and give me a lug ashore;    And my head was queer and dizzy, but I see as the bitch was weak,    And she lay on her side a-pantin', waitin' for me to speak.      What did I do with her, eh? You'd a-hardly need to ax,    But I sold my barrer a Monday, and paid the bloomin' tax.      That's right, Mr. Preacher, pat her--you ain't not afeared of her now!--    Dang this here tellin' of stories--look at the"]]]
