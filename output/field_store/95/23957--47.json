Would she be less a queen if she were not dependent upon  some man for her daily bread----\"    A sudden flash of something, she could not tell whether it was pain or  rebellion or despair, crossed Mrs. Bell's face, and Silvia hesitated and  then went on rather hurriedly, as if, knowing she had struck a false  note, she sought to distract the other woman's thought from it. \"I am  trying to demonstrate the glorious mission that belongs to woman when  she fills her predestined sphere of economic independence and political  freedom.\"    \"Political freedom will come first and easiest,\" said the woman slowly.  She raised her eyes, filled with trouble, and looked full into Silvia's.  \"The other is the greater boon, and will be harder to win. Some day I  may need to consult a lawyer; there is no one I would so gladly trust;  it is a personal matter and may adjust itself, if not----\"    \"If not, telephone to make sure that I am in, and I shall be glad to see  you at any time,\" answered Silvia.    There was the sound of a quick, firm step in the hall, and the bell  rang. Mrs. Bell opened the door and admitted Dr. Earl. After a few  questions and the exchange of greetings, he went over to the bedside of  his small patient. He found the child doing admirably, and glanced  hastily about the room, trying to make up his mind whether he might  offer any other assistance than that of a professional character. He  decided that he could not, and realized with a sense of pleasure and  relief that Miss Holland would be able to attend to such details with  more tact and skill than he could. Nor could he help the glow of  gratification that they should be associated in so vital a matter, one  that he felt swept away the petty conventionalities of society, and  placed them on a footing of understanding and common sympathy not to  have been acquired by months, or even years, of the ordinary social  amenities. After a few directions for the care of the small patient,  and a promise to look in the following day, he told Mrs. Bell how to  find him in case of any sudden need and took up his hat and stick.    \"Were you going, Dr. Earl? Can I set you down anywhere? My car is at the  door.\"    He bowed, and followed her out. \"We have an embarrassment of riches,\" he  said, \"for my car is also here.\" Then, rather boyishly, moved by an  impulse he would have found it hard to explain, he said, \"Suppose we  dismiss them both, and walk up through the Park?\"    She acquiesced, and a few moments later they were strolling up the  Avenue, rather silently, considering that each had many things to say.  As usual, it was the woman who broke the silence.    \"Tell me about all this. I never was more interested in anything in my  life,\" she said, looking up at him with a glance that carried the  subtlest flattery, and, while her query was vague, he understood and  made no attempt to evade it.    \"It is a long story,\" he said; \"have you time for it to-day? And it is  really no more remarkable than the effect you produced in your parade  yesterday, and I think the causes are the same. The world is full of  mystery, but before honest, earnest purpose of any kind the storehouses  of mystery will eventually open. The fact is, that the present  tremendous progressive movement in the world is spiritual and every  phase of it is interdependent upon every other element. The thoughtless  call these things 'fads.' In reality, each one of them marks a  crystallization of centuries of thought and hope and dream for the  advancement and elevation of the human race. The world, as usually  happens in spiritual matters, awakened to the importance of all of them  at the same time.\" He paused, as if realizing for the first time how  personal was the story for which she had asked. \"You will think me an  egregious egotist, Miss Holland, I fear.\"    \"No, whatever you may be, or I may think you, you need have no fears on  that score.\" She answered simply, directly. \"Please tell me--if you  think I deserve so great a confidence.\"    He bowed gravely; there was no hint of coquetry in her manner.    \"Directly after my graduation at Harvard, three years ago, I opened  offices in New York, intending to specialize in surgery, for I had  prepared for that, though I desired to obtain a general practice for a  while to put into effect and improve my theoretical knowledge. In a  misty way I soon realized that neither my own efforts nor those of my  colleagues were crowned with the success that should attend a profession  founded upon strictly scientific principles, as modern surgery is. The  chief cause of disturbance with me was that so many operations were  performed which subsequent developments showed might have been avoided,  but which at the time seemed imperative. I redoubled my studies of  _materia medica_, hoping to find a way by which this difficulty might be  obviated or overcome, and while my constant researches helped, I still  found much difficulty in arriving at accurate conclusions before  attempting an operation. I found nothing that satisfied me. I was also  greatly bothered and baffled by the large number of cases which the  surgeon encounters, controlled or dependent upon nervous conditions and  the futility of the drugs ordinarily given.    \"While in this mood a friend of mine called at my office one Wednesday  evening by appointment. He was the general manager of a large utility  company that has to do with the people of every section of the  civilized world, and a man of rare judgment, knowledge of the world, and  poise. We were on most intimate terms, and I had already told him  something of these perplexities. This evening, I had supposed that he  was coming to see me professionally, and I had made other engagements.  As soon as he stepped into my private office, he said: 'Doctor, cancel  every engagement you have for this evening. I need you very badly in  affairs of my own. You are to ask no questions, but do as I request and  send me your bill to-morrow.'    \"Of course I could not refuse him, so I arranged to go with him, and  then asked whether I should require surgical instruments or only a  medicine case. He replied that I would need neither, and I could gain  nothing from his manner, for he was very grave. At his suggestion we  walked, going up Fifth Avenue to the Park, and then across the Park to  the corner of 96th Street and Central Park West, where there stands a  great church. The rolling notes of the organ filled the quiet with an  impressiveness I had never felt before, and the congregation was singing  an old hymn with an earnestness and depth of feeling quite different  from most congregational singing. We entered and were shown to seats in  the balcony, in the front row, where we had an excellent view of most of  those below. 'You will find many of your acquaintances here,' he said,  and on looking around I was surprised at the great number of prominent  New York men and women in the audience.    \"After the preliminary proceedings those that desired to do so were  invited to tell their experiences in combating disease, or other adverse  conditions. What I heard was a revelation. This experience,  corroborating, as it did, my own observations, emphasized how little of  the field of suggestive and mental therapeutics the ordinary medical  practitioner really filled, and I determined to explore that field  before going any further with my practice. I thanked my friend for  taking me to this place, and within a month I decided to go abroad. I  visited the institutions of note in Europe, where suggestive  therapeutics are practiced, and then went to India, where I spent many  months. There I found the original source of suggestive, mental and  spiritual treatment.    \"If the Yogi of India could supplement his method of training the  subconscious mind with the knowledge which our regular physicians  possess, and could apply both with discriminating skill, we would have  the greatest human healing power ever known. The best I could hope for  was to apply as much of the wisdom of the Yogi and other cults in India  and Europe as I could master in the brief time at my disposal, and that  I am attempting to do. With all the perfection of system in training the  subconscious mind that characterizes a comparatively few of the  inhabitants of India, the millions are left without any appreciable  benefits therefrom, just as the millions here are left without the full  benefits of the special training of the few.    \"We are but touching the borderland of this mysterious realm of the  occult, the subconscious and the spiritual forces that have such an  important bearing upon all phases of human life, and which, when  intelligently applied to the child in school and the direction of the  individual in his career, promise so much for the elevation, longevity  and achievements of the human race.    \"The world is just waking up to the vast significance of the spiritual  teachings of Jesus Christ, and their bearing upon all phases and  activities of human life. When Christ told the Pharisees that 'the  kingdom of God is within you,' he carried the lesson, though little  understood then, and so fully comprehended now, that Christianity,  citizenship, government, health, happiness and progress are all  dependent upon the character of the ideals and purposes and daily life  of the individual.    \"When Christ told the lawyer that to 'love thy neighbor as thyself' was  one of the essentials of salvation, he laid the corner-stone for a pure  and honest democracy, without which underlying principle there can be no  lasting democratic government. We now know, in medicine, that much of  longevity and good health and power of recuperation depend upon the  ideals of the individual, and their inspiring influence.    \"It is too bad that with all our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#8)"],[1,"reducing the  subject to a few simple calligraphic strokes.      [14] The literati, or lettered class, were the aristocracy in what    was the most democratic of absolute monarchies. No matter how humble    his   origin, anyone of the male sex was eligible to compete in the    examinations which were based upon literary knowledge and memory of    the classics. Proficiency in handwriting was a natural result. The    successful candidate might aspire to any post in the empire, as    official positions were bestowed through literary merit. During three    days and two nights at the time of examination the candidate was not    allowed to leave his tiny box-like cell, lacking even space to lie    down. Cases of death during the examinations were not infrequent. The    examination halls in Peking are now destroyed and those in Nanking    with 20,000 cells are crumbling away.--TRANSLATOR.    It is difficult for a European to follow the thought of the Chinese  painters in these daring simplifications. Sometimes they are carried to  such an extreme as to leave us with a feeling of perplexity. Often however  they give rise to mighty conceptions and paintings whose essential  character impresses us as a unique product of genius. Calligraphic  painting reached its highest level during the Sung and Yuean periods. It  was so closely allied to painting that the Emperor Hui Tsung, who ascended  the throne in 1100, founded the Imperial Academy of Calligraphy and  Painting in the first year of his reign. Hui Tsung was himself a painter.  The books credit him with especial mastery in the representation of birds  of prey, eagles, falcons and hawks, which seems to be sufficient reason  for deliberately attributing to him every painting of a bird of prey, even  when there is evidence that it was painted two or three centuries later  than his time. Perhaps before long we shall find authentic paintings by  Hui Tsung. A painting belonging to the Musee Guimet, which comes from the  collection of Tuan Fang, is the one which by its annotations bears the  greatest guaranty of authenticity, but it is a representation of a figure  painting of the T'ang dynasty and gives us no information as to the manner  in which Hui Tsung painted eagles. However, certain paintings from his  collections have come down to us. Whether or not by the imperial hand they  proclaim a virile art, an instinct for the grandiose and a majestic  character which are the qualities of which the eagle is a symbol.    The foundation of the Academy of Calligraphy and Painting had results  quite other than those hoped for by its founder. It became imbued with the  evils of formalism. It was established in the imperial capital in court  surroundings, in other words, in an atmosphere from which true artists  depart with all possible speed. It suffered inevitably through the  influences of a taste, refined it is true, but which already inclined  toward mannerisms and preciosity. Conventions were established, subjects  became stereotyped, the taste for brilliant colors developed and, even  before the end of the Sung period, there was a marked division between  academic and national art. Pedantry and affectation began to take the  place of boldness and strength.    Doubtless this tendency would have developed still further but for a  series of disasters and the menace of a new dynasty looming on the horizon  of Central Asia, which was already resounding with the clash of Mongol  arms.          VI. THE YUeAN PERIOD--THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES      From the standpoint of civilization the Mongolian dynasty of Yuean brought  nothing to China. On the contrary, the foreign elements were absorbed by  the ancient culture for, in the final summing-up, the mind will always be  stronger than weapons. From the standpoint of painting, however, this  period has marked individuality.    The Sung period had been distinctly dominated by the ideals of Southern  China. Philosophical inspiration had proven too strong to permit the style  of the Northern School to assert absolute sway. In this we must make an  exception of Buddhist painting, which,--save in the work of a few chance  painters of religious subjects--continues the traditions of the T'ang  period, preserving the original character of its coloring. It is true that  there were masterpieces to the credit of the Northern School but it had by  no means kept to the style of vivid illumination which marked its  inception.[15] It had yielded to the influence of the Southern style,  was simplified by this contact and took on the austerity and proportion of  the South. It would seem as if the painters hastened to add their  testimony before the philosophy of the ancient sages should disappear.  They strove to give the world perfect images in which the great principles  of the universe could be felt vibrating. The only suitable medium for such  expression was the technique of the Southern School which they followed  with more or less fidelity.      [15] It should be borne in mind that the author uses the term    illumination in the sense of color applied within a distinct and    limiting outline. This is illustrated in the definitions of single and    double contour.--TRANSLATOR.      [Illustration: PLATE XIV. BAMBOOS IN MONOCHROME BY WU CHEN    Yuean Period. Musee Guimet.]    Southern China was at that time the scene of awakened faculties. Shaken to  its foundations by the mystic movement--both Taoist and Buddhist--of the  T'ang period, the Confucian doctrine had lost ground but had not yet  congealed into the rigid official code of a Chu Hsi. While heterodox  beliefs still prevailed, all were free to borrow their prophetic and  poetic meaning.    When the Mongols came into power, they only carried to completion the work  of conservation begun by the Sung emperors. In their contact with China  they resembled timid pupils quite as much as conquerors. Once emperor of  China, the Mongol Kublai Khan could not but remember his purely Chinese  education. Moreover it was quite the Tartar custom to extend their  conquests to administrative organization, by establishing a hierarchy of  functionaries. The conception of a supreme and autocratic State, paternal  in its absolutism, intervening even to the details of private life in  order to assure the happiness of the people,--this idea, dear to the  literary conservators of the Confucian School during the Sung period, was  also too similar to the Tartar ideal to be denied immediate adoption.  Heterodox doctrines were formally banished from schools. Rejected with  scorn as being corrupt and dangerous, there remained of these doctrines  only such residuum as might be found in the independent thought of  artists, who were more difficult to control. The magnificent movement of  the Sung period began to abate; it produced its last master pieces and  gradually waned, until under Ming rule it was to die out completely.    The Yuean epoch, therefore, appears in the light of a transition period  connecting the fifteenth century of Ming with the thirteenth century of  Sung. From the point of view which interests us, it did nothing but  complete a work which had been carried on with energy and success by  adherents in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It strove to reduce  China to a severely regulated State in which all great movements and  impulses should be under strict control. It succeeded. It succeeded so  well, indeed, that the Europeans who came to know China in the seventeenth  century and who rediscovered it so unnecessarily in the nineteenth  century, believed it to have been motionless for two thousand years. There  is no need to lay stress here upon the absurdity of this prevalent  opinion. It has been seen in the past and will be seen in modern times,  that the inner travail, the evolution and the diversity are by no means  arrested. Like the nations of Europe, China has had its evolution; the  causes were analagous, its destiny the same. This is especially felt in  the history of its painting. When the potent inspiration of the Southern  School began to wane, the style of the North took the upper hand for  obvious reasons.      [Illustration: PLATE XV. PAINTINGS OF THE YUeAN OR EARLY MING PERIOD    Style of the Northern School. Collection of R. Petrucci.]    Partially civilized barbarians occupied the highest places in the State.  They were the controlling party at the imperial court and had usurped the  place of the old society, refined, subtle and perhaps too studied, which  formed the environment of the last Sung emperors. Despite their naive  efforts and good will, these barbarians could not fathom an art so  austere, enlightened and balanced. They were utterly ignorant of such a  masterly conception of nature as was evoked in Chinese painting.  Monochrome to them was dull. They could admire on trust, but they could  not understand. On the other hand, the Northern style with its bold  assurance, strong coloring and drawing positive almost to the point of  seeming sculptural, was more akin to their mental outlook. There at least  they found something which recalled those rugs on which they appear to  have exhausted their artistic resources. In a word, they were more  accustomed to the Northern style and had brought with them from the  Northern regions their own artists, both Chinese and barbarian.    The Northern temperament, reflective, strong and positive, now began to  assume mastery over the bewildered reveries of the Southern nature. Things  are seen to change. Even the masters who continue the Sung tradition  infuse a somewhat more robust quality into their works, but, in so doing,  they lose a certain stirring depth which gave the work of their  predecessors such an exceptional character. Caught between these two  tendencies, Yuean painting takes on new traits, which are perhaps more  accessible to European mentality because they are more simple and direct.  These observations"]]]
