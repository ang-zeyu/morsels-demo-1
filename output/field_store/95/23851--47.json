There are also many other names  for winds derived from localities or from the squalls which sweep from  rivers or down mountains.    11. Then, too, there are the breezes of early morning; for the sun on  emerging from beneath the earth strikes humid air as he returns, and as  he goes climbing up the sky he spreads it out before him, extracting  breezes from the vapour that was there before the dawn. Those that still  blow on after sunrise are classed with Eurus, and hence appears to come  the Greek name [Greek: euros] as the child of the breezes, and the word  for \"to-morrow,\" [Greek: aurion], named from the early morning breezes.  Some people do indeed say that Eratosthenes could not have inferred the  true measure of the earth. Whether true or untrue, it cannot affect the  truth of what I have written on the fixing of the quarters from which  the different winds blow.    [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE WINDS (From the edition of Vitruvius by  Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]    12. If he was wrong, the only result will be that the individual winds  may blow, not with the scope expected from his measurement, but with  powers either more or less widely extended. For the readier  understanding of these topics, since I have treated them with brevity,  it has seemed best to me to give two figures, or, as the Greeks say,  [Greek: schemata], at the end of this book: one designed to show the  precise quarters from which the winds arise; the other, how by turning  the directions of the rows of houses and the streets away from their  full force, we may avoid unhealthy blasts. Let A be the centre of a  plane surface, and B the point to which the shadow of the gnomon reaches  in the morning. Taking A as the centre, open the compasses to the point  B, which marks the shadow, and describe a circle. Put the gnomon back  where it was before and wait for the shadow to lessen and grow again  until in the afternoon it is equal to its length in the morning,  touching the circumference at the point C. Then from the points B and C  describe with the compasses two arcs intersecting at D. Next draw a line  from the point of intersection D through the centre of the circle to the  circumference and call it E F. This line will show where the south and  north lie.    [Illustration]    13. Then find with the compasses a sixteenth part of the entire  circumference; then centre the compasses on the point E where the line  to the south touches the circumference, and set off the points G and H  to the right and left of E. Likewise on the north side, centre the  compasses on the circumference at the point F on the line to the north,  and set off the points I and K to the right and left; then draw lines  through the centre from G to K and from H to I. Thus the space from G to  H will belong to Auster and the south, and the space from I to K will be  that of Septentrio. The rest of the circumference is to be divided  equally into three parts on the right and three on the left, those to  the east at the points L and M, those to the west at the points N and  O. Finally, intersecting lines are to be drawn from M to O and from L  to N. Thus we shall have the circumference divided into eight equal  spaces for the winds. The figure being finished, we shall have at the  eight different divisions, beginning at the south, the letter G between  Eurus and Auster, H between Auster and Africus, N between Africus and  Favonius, O between Favonius and Caurus, K between Caurus and  Septentrio, I between Septentrio and Aquilo, L between Aquilo and  Solanus, and M between Solanus and Eurus. This done, apply a gnomon to  these eight divisions and thus fix the directions of the different  alleys.          CHAPTER VII    THE SITES FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS      1. Having laid out the alleys and determined the streets, we have next  to treat of the choice of building sites for temples, the forum, and all  other public places, with a view to general convenience and utility. If  the city is on the sea, we should choose ground close to the harbour as  the place where the forum is to be built; but if inland, in the middle  of the town. For the temples, the sites for those of the gods under  whose particular protection the state is thought to rest and for  Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, should be on the very highest point  commanding a view of the greater part of the city. Mercury should be in  the forum, or, like Isis and Serapis, in the emporium: Apollo and Father  Bacchus near the theatre: Hercules at the circus in communities which  have no gymnasia nor amphitheatres; Mars outside the city but at the  training ground, and so Venus, but at the harbour. It is moreover shown  by the Etruscan diviners in treatises on their science that the fanes of  Venus, Vulcan, and Mars should be situated outside the walls, in order  that the young men and married women may not become habituated in the  city to the temptations incident to the worship of Venus, and that  buildings may be free from the terror of fires through the religious  rites and sacrifices which call the power of Vulcan beyond the walls.  As for Mars, when that divinity is enshrined outside the walls, the  citizens will never take up arms against each other, and he will defend  the city from its enemies and save it from danger in war.    2. Ceres also should be outside the city in a place to which people need  never go except for the purpose of sacrifice. That place should be under  the protection of religion, purity, and good morals. Proper sites should  be set apart for the precincts of the other gods according to the nature  of the sacrifices offered to them.    The principle governing the actual construction of temples and their  symmetry I shall explain in my third and fourth books. In the second I  have thought it best to give an account of the materials used in  buildings with their good qualities and advantages, and then in the  succeeding books to describe and explain the proportions of buildings,  their arrangements, and the different forms of symmetry.          BOOK II          INTRODUCTION      1. Dinocrates, an architect who was full of confidence in his own ideas  and skill, set out from Macedonia, in the reign of Alexander, to go to  the army, being eager to win the approbation of the king. He took with  him from his country letters from relatives and friends to the principal  military men and officers of the court, in order to gain access to them  more readily. Being politely received by them, he asked to be presented  to Alexander as soon as possible. They promised, but were rather slow,  waiting for a suitable opportunity. So Dinocrates, thinking that they  were playing with him, had recourse to his own efforts. He was of very  lofty stature and pleasing countenance, finely formed, and extremely  dignified. Trusting, therefore, to these natural gifts, he undressed  himself in his inn, anointed his body with oil, set a chaplet of poplar  leaves on his head, draped his left shoulder with a lion's skin, and  holding a club in his right hand stalked forth to a place in front of  the tribunal where the king was administering justice.    2. His strange appearance made the people turn round, and this led  Alexander to look at him. In astonishment he gave orders to make way for  him to draw near, and asked who he was. \"Dinocrates,\" quoth he, \"a  Macedonian architect, who brings thee ideas and designs worthy of thy  renown. I have made a design for the shaping of Mount Athos into the  statue of a man, in whose left hand I have represented a very spacious  fortified city, and in his right a bowl to receive the water of all the  streams which are in that mountain, so that it may pour from the bowl  into the sea.\"    3. Alexander, delighted with the idea of his design, immediately  inquired whether there were any fields in the neighbourhood that could  maintain the city in corn. On finding that this was impossible without  transport from beyond the sea, \"Dinocrates,\" quoth he, \"I appreciate  your design as excellent in composition, and I am delighted with it, but  I apprehend that anybody who should found a city in that spot would be  censured for bad judgement. For as a newborn babe cannot be nourished  without the nurse's milk, nor conducted to the approaches that lead to  growth in life, so a city cannot thrive without fields and the fruits  thereof pouring into its walls, nor have a large population without  plenty of food, nor maintain its population without a supply of it.  Therefore, while thinking that your design is commendable, I consider  the site as not commendable; but I would have you stay with me, because  I mean to make use of your services.\"    4. From that time, Dinocrates did not leave the king, but followed him  into Egypt. There Alexander, observing a harbour rendered safe by  nature, an excellent centre for trade, cornfields throughout all Egypt,  and the great usefulness of the mighty river Nile, ordered him to build  the city of Alexandria, named after the king. This was how Dinocrates,  recommended only by his good looks and dignified carriage, came to be so  famous. But as for me, Emperor, nature has not given me stature, age has  marred my face, and my strength is impaired by ill health. Therefore,  since these advantages fail me, I shall win your approval, as I hope, by  the help of my knowledge and my writings.    5. In my first book, I have said what I had to say about the functions  of architecture and the scope of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#8)"],[1,"may  well be an attempt to prevent the spirit from lingering in the vicinity.  Similarly, even today, the orthodox Jew, in case of grave illness in his  family, changes the given name of the sufferer. To confuse the evil  spirit causing the disease?    Further survivals of totemism as found in the Old Testament are  illustrated by the worship of the bull and the serpent. Portable gilded  images of bulls were consecrated and Hosea protested against the worship  of the bull in the kingdom of Israel (Hos. VIII, 5; X, 5). The famous  golden calf of the Israelites, which was the object of Moses' anger, was  a totemic idol. The worship of the serpent was practiced by Moses  himself (Num. XXI, 9). A brazen serpent was worshiped in the temple of  Jerusalem, and was only destroyed by Hezekiah about 700 B.C. (2 Kings  XVIII, 4).    The ancient Hebrews, as well as their neighbors, were phallic  worshipers. To primitive people it is but a natural phase to have the  phallus become the exponent of creative power, and as such to be  worshiped. To these primitive minds there was nothing immoral in genuine  phallic worship. Signs of phallicism among the ancient Hebrews can be  clearly pointed out; the serpent was a phallic symbol. \"That the serpent  was the phallus is proved by the Bible itself. The Hebrew word used for  serpent is 'Nachash,' which is everywhere else translated in the Bible  in a phallic sense, as in Ezekiel XVI, 36, where it is rendered  'filthiness' in the sense of exposure, like the 'having thy Boseth  naked' of Micah.\" (_J. B. Hannay, \"Christianity, the Sources of its  Teaching and Symbolism.\"_) The ark itself was a feminine symbol, and  phallicism would explain why Moses made an ark and put in it a rod and  two stones. \"The Eduth, the Shechina, the Tsur, and the Yahveh were  identical; simply different names for the same thing, the phallus. They  occupied the female ark with which they formed the double sexed life  symbol. The Hebrew religion had thus a purely phallic basis, as was to  be expected from a ritual and symbolism derived from two extremely  phallic nations, Babylon and Egypt.\" (_J. B. Hannay, Ibid._) An  intelligent reading of Exodus XXXIV, 13, and 1 Kings XIV, 23 and 24,  will prove the above contention.    Once more our Martian guest is besieged by the Hebrew Zealot to examine  the divine revelation of his religion. This time the Martian notes, \"I,  Yahveh, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers  upon the children unto the third and fourth generations\" (Deut.), which  seems to him to savor of a cruel and monstrous being. He cannot perceive  of a just being favoring slavery (Ex. XI), or of a merciful father  ordering human sacrifice (Ex. XIII), (Lev. XXVII, 29), (Num. XIII, 3).  He is dumbfounded to find references to cannibalism (Lev. XXVI,  14-16-28; Deut. XXVIII, 53-58; Jer. XIX, 9; Ezek. V, 10; Kings VI,  26-29-33). A Benevolent Being, he reasons, would not sanction war and  destruction of the captured enemy, yet there are instances of this  (Deut. XXI, 10-14; Deut. XX, 13-14; Deut. VII, 1-2-16). The reading of  Numbers V, 11-29, and Deuteronomy XXII nauseated him. The Hebrew Zealot,  observing the utter disgust with which the reader was regarding his  revelation, is obliged to explain to the bewildered barbarian unbeliever  that the Old Testament is the foundation for all of our morals and that  without it we would have developed into a very shocking and immoral  race.    Since the visitor wishes to remain courteous he proceeds, but with a  great deal of hesitation, to further examine the revelation of God. At  this point he is assured that this work is read in most schools and  taught to small children. However, our guest is again disillusioned; for  no sooner does he arrive at Genesis, XII, 11-20, than he finds that  Abraham, good Abraham, the pure, the father of all Hebrews, makes of the  sacred relationship of marriage a means of personal gain and safety by  betraying his own wife. Now it is the Martian's turn to inquire of the  Hebrew whether the latter had ever read this story to his own daughter?  Or, the story of Abraham's affair with Hagar, his handmaiden? Was the  Hebrew's young daughter aware that Isaac, son of Abraham, was as ready  and willing to prostitute his wife for protection for himself as was his  father Abraham?    The Martian is puzzled by the word \"sporting\" in Genesis, XXVI, 8-11,  and is informed of its meaning. A few moments after reading Genesis XIX,  1-7, he informs his would-be converter that if Lot had lived in Mars and  had offered his daughters to appease the mob, the account of that  incident would never have found its way into any work on morals.  Moreover, he failed utterly to see how the account of Lot's daughters  getting him into a drunken state, followed by a statement such as, \"Thus  were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father,\" could ever  have any moral value.    The story of Jacob, Leah, and Rachel does not appeal to this infidel  Martian, since he still believes that integrity and faithfulness are  virtues. Yet, in his endeavor to respect the courtesy due to his host,  he reaches for pencil and pad, and notes the various moral lessons he  had derived thus far from the Old Testament. He wrote lust, incest,  infidelity, and prostitution; arriving at the story of Dinah, Genesis  XXXIV, 1-2, he wrote that in addition to those vices already listed,  rape should be given a prominent place. The stories of Joseph and  Potiphar's wife, Judah and Tamar, King David and his wives, the rape of  Tamar by her brother Ammon, did not impress the Martian as stories for  the delectation of children, since he was crude enough to hold that  anything which would shock the mind of a child, could not have any moral  value and would thus be automatically excluded from any religion. He,  therefore, returned the volume to the Hebrew with the remark that as an  adult he found the stories of De Maupassant and Balzac more interesting,  even though they belonged to the same genre.    Our guest now repaired to one of our golf courses where, during the  interval of a few hours, the fresh air, the sunshine, and exercise  dispelled the mental nausea which the reading of the Old Testament had  occasioned in him. Returning to his quarters, he is approached by one of  the Christian Brethren and the New Testament is placed in his hands with  these remarks, \"The Christian recognizes that in the Old Testament the  Jews have given to the Christian world its greatest heritage.\" The fact  that in exchange for this priceless heritage, the Christians have given  to the Jews a series of persecutions unequaled in the annals of human  warfare is explained by the quality of the Brotherhood of Man that  naturally manifests itself after a complete conversion to the Bible's  precepts. The Old Testament contains the first revelations of God; the  New Testament, the last revelations. Our Christian Brother \"forgets\" to  remind the visitor that the difference of opinion regarding these two  Testaments of God has caused more sorrow, bloodshed, harm, devilment,  misery, and devastation than any other single item in the life and  history of the human race.    The Martian is hard pressed to reconcile the fact that Mohammedanism six  hundred years after the appearance of Christianity triumphed over  Christianity in a great portion of the earth's surface; yet he is  informed that Christianity is _the_ religion of God, that Allah made the  Mohammedans, Jehovah the Jews, the Trinity the Christians, and the rest  of the believers were illegitimate children of the above gods, was the  only conclusion he could reach. In a few moments the myth of Christ  begins to unfold itself before his eyes in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark,  Luke, and John, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Apocalypse. He finds,  \"The so-called Messianic texts which are supposed to prefigure Jesus in  the Old Testament have all been either misunderstood or deliberately  misinterpreted. The most celebrated is that in Isaiah VII, 14, which  predicts that a virgin shall bear a son, Emmanuel, but the word, Al-mah,  which the Septuagint rendered \"virgin\" means in Hebrew a young woman,  and this passage merely deals with the approaching birth of a son to the  king or the prophet himself. This error of the Septuagint is one of the  sources of the legend relating to the virginal birth of Jesus. As early  as the second century A.D. the Jews perceived it and pointed it out to  the Greeks, but the Church knowingly persisted in the false reading, and  for over fifteen centuries she has clung to her error.\"    His attentive reading convinces him that not one of the Gospels is the  work of an eyewitness to the scenes recorded; a little side  investigation reveals that there were a great many writings called  Gospels, from which the Church finally adopted four, guaranteeing their  inspiration and absolute veracity, no doubt because they were in favor  in four very influential churches, Matthew at Jerusalem, Mark at Rome or  at Alexandria, Luke at Antioch, and John at Ephesus. Moreover, what the  Gospels tell him, he perceives is what different Christian communities  believed concerning Jesus between the years 70 and 100 A.D. In Matthew  XXVI, 39, Mark XIV, 35, and Luke XXII, 42, there are words such as those  Jesus is supposed to have uttered during the slumber of these very same  Apostles. This occurrence enlightens him as to what St. Augustine meant  when he wrote, \"I should not believe in the Gospel if I had not the  authority of the Church for so doing.\" If the documents are stuffed with  the authority of the Church, these Gospels cannot be utilized for a  history of the real life of Jesus.    A study of the Epistles of St. Paul reveals that St. Paul taught that  sin and death came into the world by Adam's fall. In spite of a diligent  search the Martian found no mention of this in the words ascribed to"]]]
