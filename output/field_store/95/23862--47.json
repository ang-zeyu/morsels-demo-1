In place of this, we find now something more than the  beginnings of a national-market and distinct traces of that of a  world-market. In the towns the change was even still more marked. Here  we have a sudden and hothouse-like development of the influence of  money. The guild-system, originally designed for associations of  craftsmen, for which the chief object was the man and the work, and  not the mere acquirement of profit, was changing its character. The  guilds were becoming close corporations of privileged capitalists,  while a commercial capitalism, as already indicated, was raising its  head in all the larger centres. In consequence of this state of  things, the rapid development of the towns and of commerce, national  and international, and the economic backwardness of the country-side,  a landless proletariat was being formed, which meant on the one hand  an enormous increase in mendicancy of all kinds, and on the other the  creation of a permanent class of only casually-employed persons, whom  the towns absorbed indeed, but for the most part with a new form of  citizenship involving only the bare right of residence within the  walls. Similar social phenomena were, of course, manifesting  themselves contemporaneously in other parts of Europe; but in Germany  the change was more sudden than elsewhere, and was complicated by  special political circumstances.    The political and military functions of that for the mediaeval polity  of Germany, so important class, the knighthood, or lower nobility, had  by this time become practically obsolete, mainly owing to the changed  conditions of warfare. But yet the class itself was numerous, and  still, nominally at least, possessed of most of its old privileges and  authority. The extent of its real power depended, however, upon the  absence or weakness of a central power, whether Imperial or  State-territorial. The attempt to reconstitute the centralized power  of the empire under Maximilian, of which the _Reichsregiment_ was the  outcome, had, as we have seen, not proved successful. Its means of  carrying into effect its own decisions were hopelessly inadequate. In  1523 it was already weakened, and became little more than a \"survival\"  after the Reichstag held at Nuernberg in 1524. Thus this body, which  had been called into existence at the instance of the most powerful  estates of the empire, was \"shelved\" with the practically unanimous  consent of those who had been instrumental in creating it.    But if the attempt at Imperial centralization had failed, the force of  circumstances tended partly for this very reason to favour  State-territorial centralization. The aim of all the territorial  magnates, the higher members of the Imperial system, was to  consolidate their own princely power within the territories owing them  allegiance. This desire played a not unimportant part in the  establishment of the Reformation in certain parts of the country--for  example, in Wuertemberg, and in the northern lands of East Prussia  which were subject to the Grand Master of the Teutonic knights. The  time was at hand for the transformation of the mediaeval feudal  territory, with its local jurisdictions and its ties of service, into  the modern bureaucratic state, with its centralized administration and  organized system of salaried functionaries subject to a central  authority.    The religious movement inaugurated by Luther met and was absorbed by  all these elements of change. It furnished them with a religious  _flag_, under cover of which they could work themselves out. This was  necessary in an age when the Christian theology was unquestioningly  accepted in one or another form by wellnigh all men, and hence entered  as a practical belief into their daily thoughts and lives. The  Lutheran Reformation, from its inception in 1517 down to the Peasants'  War of 1525, at once absorbed, and was absorbed by, all the  revolutionary elements of the time. Up to the last-mentioned date it  gathered revolutionary force year by year. But this was the turning  point.    With the crushing of the peasants' revolt and the decisively  anti-popular attitude taken up by Luther, the religious movement  associated with him ceased any longer to have a revolutionary  character. It henceforth became definitely subservient to the new  interests of the wealthy and privileged classes, and as such  completely severed itself from the more extreme popular reforming  sects.    Up to this time, though by no means always approved by Luther himself  or his immediate followers, and in some cases even combated by them,  the latter were nevertheless not looked upon with disfavour by large  numbers of the rank and file of those who regarded Martin Luther as  their leader.    Nothing could exceed the violence of language with which Luther  himself attacked all who stood in his way. Not only the  ecclesiastical, but also the secular heads of Christendom came in for  the coarsest abuse; \"swine\" and \"water-bladder\" are not the strongest  epithets employed. But this was not all; in his _Treatise on Temporal  Authority and how far it should be Obeyed_ (published in 1523), whilst  professedly maintaining the thesis that the secular authority is a  Divine ordinance, Luther none the less expressly justifies resistance  to all human authority where its mandates are contrary to \"the word of  God.\" At the same time, he denounces in his customary energetic  language the existing powers generally. \"Thou shouldst know,\" he says,  \"that since the beginning of the world a wise prince is truly a rare  bird, but a pious prince is still more rare.\" \"They\" (princes) \"are  mostly the greatest fools or the greatest rogues on earth; therefore  must we at all times expect from them the worst, and little good.\"  Farther on, he proceeds: \"The common man begetteth understanding, and  the plague of the princes worketh powerfully among the people and the  common man. He will not, he cannot, he purposeth not, longer to suffer  your tyranny and oppression. Dear princes and lords, know ye what to  do, for God will no longer endure it? The world is no more as of old  time, when ye hunted and drove the people as your quarry. But think ye  to carry on with much drawing of sword, look to it that one do not  come who shall bid ye sheath it, and that not in God's name!\"    Again, in a pamphlet published the following year, 1524, relative to  the Reichstag of that year, Luther proclaims that the judgment of God  already awaits \"the drunken and mad princes.\" He quotes the phrase:  \"Deposuit potentes de sede\" (Luke i. 52), and adds \"that is your case,  dear lords, even now when ye see it not!\" After an admonition to  subjects to refuse to go forth to war against the Turks, or to pay  taxes towards resisting them, who were ten times wiser and more godly  than German princes, the pamphlet concludes with the prayer: \"May God  deliver us from ye all, and of His grace give us other rulers!\"  Against such utterances as the above, the conventional exhortations to  Christian humility, non-resistance, and obedience to those in  authority, would naturally not weigh in a time of popular ferment. So,  until the momentous year 1525, it was not unnatural that,  notwithstanding his quarrel with Muenzer and the Zwickau enthusiasts,  and with others whom he deemed to be going \"too far,\" Luther should  have been regarded as in some sort the central figure of the  revolutionary movement, political and social, no less than religious.    But the great literary and agitatory forces during the period referred  to were of course either outside the Lutheran movement proper or at  most only on the fringe of it. A mass of broadsheets and pamphlets,  specimens of some of which have been given in a former volume (_German  Society at the Close of the Middle Ages_, pp. 114-28), poured from the  press during these years, all with the refrain that things had gone on  long enough, that the common man, be he peasant or townsman, could no  longer bear it. But even more than the revolutionary literature were  the wandering preachers effective in working up the agitation which  culminated in the Peasants' War of 1525. The latter comprised men of  all classes, from the impoverished knight, the poor priest, the  escaped monk, or the travelling scholar, to the peasant, the mercenary  soldier out of employment, the poor handicraftsman, of even the  beggar. Learned and simple, they wandered about from place to place,  in the market place of the town, in the common field of the village,  from one territory to another, preaching the gospel of discontent.  Their harangues were, as a rule, as much political as religious, and  the ground tone of them all was the social or economic misery of the  time, and the urgency of immediate action to bring about a change. As  in the literature, so in the discourses, Biblical phrases designed to  give force to the new teaching abounded. The more thorough-going of  these itinerant apostles openly aimed at nothing less than the  establishment of a new Christian Commonwealth, or, as they termed it,  \"the Kingdom of God on Earth.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [1] We are here, of course, dealing more especially with Germany; but  substantially the same course was followed in the development of  municipalities in other parts of Europe.

I was personally impressed by one piece of tapestry  which had been in the making for a period of four years and would  require at least one year longer to complete. It depicted the marriage  of Napoleon and Josephine. This piece is about thirty feet by twenty  feet in size, and contains forty thousand shades of color. It was not  for sale, and we were told it was to be held to take part in a  celebration of the Allied victory in the Champs Elysees. The French  people are so confident of victory that the windows facing the Arc de  Triomphe have already been engaged to view the event.    We noticed there in the textile factories old women winding yarn, many  of them eighty years of age, but still vigorous and hard at work. A  photograph of a group of young girls was taken by one of the  Commissioners and is reproduced in these pages.    A little incident occurred at the luncheon before mentioned which is  worthy of record.    I noticed a coarse looking American flag suspended in the dining room. I  made inquiry of the woman who waited upon us at the table and she said  that she had never seen an American flag, but had read about it and had  reproduced what she thought was a copy from memory. It was made from a  piece of awning containing stripes, with blue stars sewn in. This  waitress said she had worked at night on it and got as near as possible  to her idea of an American flag. While it was not a work of art, it was  a homely representation of the Stars and Stripes and a tribute from an  humble citizen of France to America.    In our wanderings about Aubusson we came across an old man who said he  was so old that he had forgotten his age. However, in a broken way, he  told of having taken part in the Franco-Prussian war, and remembered  having seen the great Napoleon. Inquiry made of some of the citizens  revealed the fact that his age was supposed to be upwards of one hundred  years.    We visited a very old church with the distinction of having two bells  which ring simultaneously.    As we left this historic place it was an inspiring sight. Nearly the  entirely populace was present and gave us any number of cheers as the  military automobiles took their departure.    At seven P. M. we arrived at Bourboule and had dinner at the Palace  Hotel. We met here Col. Cosby, military attache of the American Embassy  in Paris. This is a watering place and contains a very large  convalescent hospital where soldiers, largely officers, are sent to  finally recuperate before going back to the front. The waters contain  arsenic, are highly medicinal, and known the world over.    We saw at this place the adopted child of Helen Gould. We also met  another bright youth about eleven years of age, who spoke some English.  He asked one very pertinent question, \"Why don't you Americans send your  navy over here to help France?\"    We were served at dinner by an Amazon waitress. Without measuring her  stature, I should say that she was six feet, four inches in height and  formed in proportion. Nevertheless she was very alert and active on her  feet. She waited on the entire Commission without help, quickly and  efficiently.    The chief decoration was a large American flag in the center of the  table. This was made of flowers and was unique and beautiful. Bourboule  is in a mountainous country and early the next day we were taken to the  top of a mountain, a distance of nearly a mile, on what was termed the  \"Funicular Railroad\". We were served luncheon at the Hotel de Funicular,  on the top of the mountain, back of the town. The view from this  elevation was wonderful and worth the trip to France. When the war is  over this locality will no doubt be a leading watering place.    In the afternoon we motored to Clermont-Farrand. We stopped at Mont Dore  and at Royal to see the baths, which are noted for their cure for  asthmatic affections. We were given a reception at both places, and  waited upon by very handsome waitresses wearing most artistic hats. I  tried to secure one of these as a souvenir, but without avail, as I was  told they were made especially for this institution and were of a  special design.    On this journey we saw many interesting sights. Carts with donkeys  attached, resembled somewhat the jaunting car in Ireland. Wild flowers  were in great abundance and we stopped many times by the wayside to  purchase them from the little girls. We stopped at Salvador Rock and  listened to an echo which was remarkable; standing on the crest of the  rock, tones almost a whisper could be heard reverberating for some time.  The rock was surrounded by trees resembling very much the pine in  Arizona and the Lake Superior region.    Next we visited a fine old castle, Chateau Miral, and arrived at  Clermont-Farrand at seven P. M. Here we were given a banquet at the  Grand Hotel by the Chamber of Commerce. We met a number of prominent  people, among others Ferdinand Ferryrolles, who manages several hotels  at Monte Carlo. We also met Emmanuel Cheneau, Henri Roche, editor of the  Paris Temps, Etienne Morel and Leon Bernardaud.    We left Clermont-Farrand early on Monday, in military automobiles for  St. Etienne.          V.    THE BIRTHPLACE OF LAFAYETTE      The question of visiting the birthplace of the immortal Lafayette came  up at this time, and some of the members insisted on a trip to this  historic spot. The majority carried and we made a detour of nearly one  hundred miles to reach St. George's D'Aurac, near which stands the  stately Chateau Chavagnac, object of our reverent curiosity. At the time  of our visit it was owned by Mr. de Sahame, son of the niece of  Lafayette, bearing the title of Marquis of Lafayette, and residing at  Neuilly, near Paris. We were met by the mayor of the small village,  quite near, and the caretaker of the Chateau, which was in a very good  state of preservation, but not at that time occupied. The prefect of the  district appeared soon and the Commission presented to the ownership of  the Chateau two very beautiful flags, one an American and the other  French, together with a large bouquet of palms and roses. These flags  and the floral offering were placed in the bed where Lafayette was born.  Mr. Nichols, our Chairman, then made the following address:    In a large sense, this auspicious occasion is the most appropriate  event of our trip, because it brings us closer to that which has  been a constant bond of sympathy between the French and American  people. We are more than happy to stand here in the home of our  Washington's intimate friend, where he spent his days of peace, and  whither he retired when cares of state weighed too heavily upon  him. It is not hard to believe that here also was the birthplace of  his greatest thoughts, the beginnings of his noblest aspirations.    Lafayette, the apostle of liberty, came to struggling America at  the opportune time, and in ways that every school child at home  knows, cast his lot with ours in that perfect sympathy which  constituted Washington's greatest support. History's record,  complete as it is, cannot account for the countless things  Lafayette did for us, which many times perhaps changed the course  of events in our favor and brought us that freedom of thought, that  liberty of action, which he ever craved.    When we stop to reflect that it all began here, our souls may well  be moved beyond the mere expression of words. After a century and a  quarter we treasure Lafayette's memory and it grows with an  increasing realization of the merit of the assistance he rendered  us. Our two nations today are the embodiment of the principles he  stood for, perhaps was a great factor in inculcating in the minds  of our ancestors, to be transmitted by inheritance to us. We  rejoice that he lived; that a land like France gave him birth; that  the friendship he began continues to make the world better.    May we realize the dream ever present with him, to judge from his  actions, which speak more insistent than words, of a mutuality of  our national interests; that hand in hand the two great republics  may together work out their great destinies, together set an  example for the world worthy of its emulation, an example of a  fraternity of purpose and attempt which by its very strength will  compel the better things of life.    [Illustration: Lafayette's Deathbed, with Commission's Flag and  Flowers.]    Gentlemen: In reverence to the memory of our great compatriot, let  us devote a moment to silent contemplation of the great thoughts  that inspired the great deeds of our great brother, Lafayette.    There was a response by the prefect and the mayor of the nearby village.    This visit was an historical event. I had made up my mind, and so talked  with another member of the Commission, that it would be a fine thing to  purchase this property, endow it with a fund which would keep it always  open as a museum and present it to the French Government. Since our  return to America the property has been acquired by a group of prominent  American men and women, headed by Mrs. William Astor Chanler, for the  same purpose that some of the members of our Commission had in mind, a  most worthy project. This birthplace is known as The Chateau de  Chavagnac-Lafayette. It is the hope of the purchasers to make it \"A  French Mount Vernon\".    The Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette was born at the Chateau de Chavagnac,  in the French province of Auvergne, on September 6th, 1757. It is some  four hundred miles from Paris, in southern France. The crowning  architectural feature of this little settlement of some five hundred  souls, it stands, sentinel-like, among the sixty red-tiled roofs of the  village. The little church at which Lafayette worshipped is only a step  from the Chateau gates.    The original Chateau de Chavagnac dates from the fourteenth century. It  was destroyed by fire in 1701, but was very soon afterward rebuilt from  the"]]]
