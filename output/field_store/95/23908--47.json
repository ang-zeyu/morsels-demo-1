Thomasina led the way,  staring at Rhoda's locks with an amusement which the girl found it hard  to fathom.  She had brushed out the curling mane with even greater care  than usual, and was conscious that it was as tidy as nature had intended  it should be.  Then why stare and smile?  She could not understand, but  Thomasina only said enigmatically--    \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may!  Come on, Fuzzy!\" and led the way out  into the corridor.    Lines of girls were appearing on every side--along this corridor, along  that, down narrow nights of stairs, around unexpected corners, all  converging steadily on the central staircase.  It was like a game of  \"Follow my leader,\" and Rhoda could not but admire the ease and skill  with which \"Tom\" avoided collision, and marshalled her party to its own  table in the great dining-hall.  When every one was seated, and grace  said, the clatter of cups and saucers began, and Rhoda had her first  experience of a school meal.    Well! the tea was very welcome, and it certainly was hot, but somehow or  other it did not taste like the tea at home.  There was so much \"cup\"  about it--perhaps that was the explanation.  It was quite an effort to  get one's lips over the rim.  Thickness seemed to be the order of the  day when one looked from the china to the slices of bread and butter  piled in the many plates.  One such chunk would make a meal in itself,  thought Rhoda, nibbling fastidiously at the first slice, but whether  from the fatigue of the long journey or the stimulating effect of  companionship, her appetite seemed to be unusually keen, and when it was  finished she put out her hand to take a second slice.    Instantly Thomasina's voice rang out in warning.  \"Stop that, Fuzzy!  That's forbidden!\"  Rhoda stared at her in dignified displeasure.  \"My  name happens to be Rhoda Chester!\"    \"Congratulate you, I'm sure.  Couldn't be sweeter; but you mustn't break  rules, Rhoda Chester, all the same.  The rule in this school is that no  girl helps herself at meals, or asks for more, or pays any attention to  her own plate.\"    \"But if I am hungry?  If I _want_ more?  How am I to get it?\"    \"You must rely on the thoughtfulness and attention of your neighbours.  Each girl is supposed to look after those beside her, but if she forgets  you must starve in silence, knowing that you suffer in a good cause.  I  find myself that a slight nudge applied to the elbow just as the cup is  being carried to the mouth is a useful and judicious reminder...  Let me  press a piece of plum-cake upon you, Miss Chester!\"    She held out the plate of bread with her squarest smile, and Rhoda  smiled back with a curious sense of elation.  She questioned herself  curiously as to its cause, and made the surprising discovery that it was  because Thomasina had spoken to her, and showed some faint signs of  friendliness!    Tea over, there was another game of \"Follow my leader,\" to the top story  of the building this time, where all the length of a corridor was lined  by baggage, with the mysterious addition of a flat wicker clothes-basket  beside each trunk.  The house-mistress, Miss Everett, was flitting to  and fro, and explained to the bewildered new girls that as the cubicles  afforded no room for the accommodation boxes they must unpack upstairs,  and carry down their possessions to store in drawers and wardrobes.    For the next hour and a half, therefore, the curious scene was witnessed  of sixty pupils staggering downstairs in turns under the weight of heavy  baskets of clothes, and meeting with sundry adventures by the way.  Lazy  girls gave themselves the usual additional share of trouble by  overweighting their load and toppling it over on the floor; hasty girls  tripped on the stairs and collapsed in a heap, with a rain of boots  falling on their head and pins showering broadcast through the  banisters; careless girls took a rest to ease aching backs, then nipped  up the wrong basket and bore it away, to reappear ten minutes later,  puffing and injured, and receive indignant reproaches from the rightful  owners.    Rhoda worked with a will, undisturbed by any such interruptions.  It was  with the unconsciousness of habit that she shook out her silk-lined  skirts, on lifting them from the box, but the rustling sound could not  be mistaken, and instantly she was aware that the girls on either side  were mincing round in affected fashion, shaking out their own skirts,  and simpering meaningly in her direction.    At the first glance from her eyes they became statues of propriety, but  she felt their ridicule, and catching the giggles of laughter which  followed her retreat blushed over cheek and neck in an agony of  mortification.    After all, was it appropriate to bring fine clothes to school?  Where  the rules of the house were plain living and high thinking, was it not  better to dress accordingly?  Might not display savour of ignorance, of  lack of perception, of--oh, horrors!--of snobbishness itself?    The new dresses hung neglected on their pegs, and Rhoda put on a silk  blouse with her serge skirt, and walked down to supper in mental  sackcloth and ashes.    But here was a pleasant surprise!  The room was not grey any longer, but  flooded with rosy light from the pink-hued shades which covered the  electric burners.  The girls, too, were no longer clad in dark blue as  in a uniform, but shone forth in blouses of brilliant hues, pink, blue,  red, and white alternating gaily, with an occasional green or yellow to  add to the variety.  There was in the atmosphere an indefinable air of  relaxation, of rest after labour, which added tenfold to the brightness  of the scene.  What if on each plate there was only a morsel of fish,  not half enough to satisfy clamourous appetites, there was unlimited  bread and jam to follow, and if cocoa was not the drink of all others  which one would have chosen, it was at least wholesome and satisfying.  Rhoda ate and was thankful, and felt ready for bed even before the  summons came.  Several times during the day, when her feelings had  threatened to become too keen for endurance, but pride had forbidden  outward demonstration, she had cherished a determination to cry  comfortably in bed; but when the time came she was so sleepy, so  exhausted with excitement, the bed was so unexpectedly sympathetic, that  she forgot her resolution, and, snoodling down on the pillow, fell  swiftly and happily asleep.        CHAPTER SIX.    TOM'S RULE.    The next moment, as it seemed, there came the roll of a distant gong,  and instantly there burst into life a score of jangling bells, clanging  and tinkling over one's very head in a manner calculated to destroy the  strongest nerves.  Rhoda felt an agonised certainty that the Chase was  on fire, and springing up was confronted by the blue walls of her little  cubicle.  Memory came back then, and with a pang of regret she lay back  in bed, listening to the succession of groans, yawns, and sighs which  arose from every corner of the room.    They were so eloquent that one could almost _see_ the sleepers  stretching themselves in turn, blinking heavy lids, and rubbing  dishevelled locks like so many sleek, lazy kittens.  For a moment no one  spoke, then began a chorus of lamentations.    \"Seven o'clock!  It can't be true.  I haven't slept a wink all night!\"    \"I've been getting up at half-past eight all the holidays, and having a  cup of tea in bed before that.  It's killing going back to this!\"    \"Wait till the mornings are dark, and the water is frozen in the jugs;  that's the time it is really fun.  This is a mere trifle.\"    \"It's not a trifle at all.  I'm a growing girl, and need sleep.  If Miss  Bruce had any heart she would see it, and give me an excuse.\"    \"She'll give you a mark instead, if you are not quick.  Hurry up now!  No laggards!\" cried Thomasina's voice, in answer to which there came  still louder groans, and the creaking of bedsteads as one girl after  another rose to her feet.    Rhoda rose with the rest, and for ten minutes there was silence, broken  only by the splashing of water.  Then suddenly the air was filled with a  deep, melodious roll, at which, as at a signal, Thomasina appeared from  her lair--beautiful in a magenta dressing-jacket, and hair coiled in a  tight little knot at the top of her head--and opened wide the door of  the dormitory.  Rhoda, peering from between her curtains could see other  doors opening all the way down the corridor, and bare arms hastily  withdrawn from view, while all the time the music swelled into fuller  force, and pealed over the great, silent house like some majestic  wakening voice.    \"What is it?\" she queried breathlessly, and Thomasina answered from  behind her curtain:    \"The organ, of course.  The organ in the hall.  One of the music  mistresses plays a voluntary every morning ten minutes after we get up,  and the choir sings a hymn.  You will hear them presently.  Each house  takes it in turn to do choir duty.  It's the Greens this week.\"    As she spoke the first note of the hymn sounded, and the words rose  clearly on the air:--      \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,    Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.    Holy, holy, holy, Merciful and Mighty,    God in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!\"    The clear voices were softened by distance into almost angelic  sweetness, the treble rang true and sweet against the harmonious  background of alto; the organ sank to a flute-like softness.  It was an  unexpected and beautiful beginning to the day's work, and the tears  started to Rhoda's eyes as she listened, for she was of an emotional  nature, quick to respond to any outside influence.  She followed each  line of the hymn with devout attention, and when it was finished knelt  down beside her bed to offer a prayer, which was much longer and more  fervent than it would have been ten "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#8)"],[1,"his one irresistible temptation, _i.e._, a lively  spider; this he would seize and hold in his beak while he hopped about  the cage, clicking loudly with delight. After a time I began to let him  out for an hour or two, first releasing him when he was moulting and  could not fly very easily. He learned to go back to his cage of his own  accord, and was rewarded by always finding some favourite morsel there.  Thus, by slow degrees, he lost all fear, and attached himself to me with  a strength of affection that expressed itself in many endearing little  ways. When called by name he would always answer with a special chirp  and look up expectantly, either to receive something or to be let out.  His song was very similar to the English nightingale, extremely liquid  and melodious, with the same \"jug-jug,\" but more powerful and sustained.  On my return to the room after a short absence he would greet me with  delight, fluttering his outspread wings and singing his sweetest song,  looking intently at me, swaying his head from side to side, and whilst  this ecstasy of song lasted he would even refuse to notice his most  favourite food, as if he must express his joy before appetite could be  gratified. After a few years he seemed to adopt me as a kind of mate!  for as spring came round he endeavoured to construct a nest by stealing  little twigs out of the grate and flying with them to a chosen retreat  behind an ornamental scroll at the top of the looking-glass. He spent a  great deal of time fussing about this nest, which never came to  anything, but he very obligingly attended to my supposed wants by  picking up an occasional fly, or piece of sugar, and, hovering before me  on the wing, would endeavour to put it into my mouth; or, if he was in  his cage, would mince up a spider or caterpillar with water, and then,  with his beak full of the delicious compound, would call and chirp  unceasingly until I came near and \"made believe\" to taste it, and not  till then would he be content to enjoy it himself.    During an absence from home, Birdie once escaped out of doors, and was  seen on the roof of the house singing in high glee; the servants called  him, the cage was put out, but all to no purpose, he evidently meant to  have \"a real good time,\" and kept flying from one tree to another until  he was a quarter of a mile from home. A faithful servant kept him in  sight for three hours, by which time hunger made him return to our  garden, where he feasted on some raspberries, took a leisurely bath in a  tub of water, and at length flew in at a bedroom window, where he was  safely caged. I never knew a bird with so much intelligence, one might  almost say reasoning power. He was once very thirsty after being out of  his cage for many hours, and at luncheon he went to an empty silver  spoon and time after time pretended to drink, looking fixedly at me as  if he felt sure I should know what he meant, and waited quietly until I  put water into the spoon. Another curious trait was his sense of humour.  Whilst I was writing one day he went up to a rose, which was at the far  end of the table, and began pecking at the leaves. I told him not to do  it, when, to my surprise, he immediately ran the whole length of the  table and made a scolding noise up in my face, and then, just like a  naughty child, went back and did it again. He would sometimes try to  tease me away from my writing by taking hold of my pen and tugging at a  corner of the paper, and whenever the terrible operation of cutting his  claws had to be gone through, he quietly curled up his toes and held the  scissors with his beak, so that it needed two people to circumvent his  clever resistance. He had wonderfully acute vision, and would let me  know directly a hawk was in sight, though it might be but the merest  speck in the sky. He once had a narrow escape, for a sparrow-hawk made a  swoop at him in his cage just outside the drawing-room window, and had  no one been at hand would probably have dragged him through the bars.  Whenever he saw a jay or magpie, a jackdaw or cat, his clicking note  always told me of some enemy in sight. For many years Birdie was my  cherished pet, never was there a closer friendship. As I passed his cage  each night I put my hand in to stroke his feathers, and was always  greeted with a low, murmuring note of affection never heard in the  daytime.    It was with deep concern that I watched Birdie's declining strength;  there was no disease, only weakness, and at last appetite failed, but  even then he would take whatever I offered him and hold it in his beak  as if to show that even to the last he would try to please me as far as  he could, but he wanted nothing but the quiet rest which came at length,  and dear little Birdie is now only a cherished memory of true  friendship.          [Illustration: ZOeE, THE NUTHATCH.]    ZOeE, THE NUTHATCH.      A visit to a bird-dealer's shop always awakens a deep feeling of pity in  my mind as I look at the unhappy, flutter-little captives, and think of  the breezy hill-sides and pleasant lanes from which they came, to be  shut up in cages a few inches square, with but little light, a stifling  atmosphere, strange diet, and no means of washing their ruffled feathers  or stretching their wings in flight. Truly, they are in evil case, and  no wonder so many die off within a few days of their capture! In some  places they are better cared for than in others, but in most bird-shops  dirt and misery seem to prevail amongst the tenants of the cages.    One such place I have often visited for the sake of meeting with live  curios. The owner was a kind-hearted woman, and did not intentionally  ill-treat her live-stock; but the shop was very dark and dirty, and one  could but wonder how anything contrived to live in such close, stivy  air. On going in one day, I nearly walked over a large, pensive-looking  duckling which stood in the middle of the shop. His brother had been  considered suitable for the adornment of a table-lamp with a  looking-glass stand, on which a bright yellow duckling was placed, as if  swimming on water; this bird, having some darker markings, was of no use  for that purpose and had been allowed to live. He had a strange,  old-fashioned look, and gave one the impression that he was already  tired of life and felt bored. A lark on its little piece of turf,  fluttering and looking up for a glimpse of blue sky; a dejected robin,  with no tail to speak of, and sundry other sad-looking specimens met my  pitying gaze, and I suppose I had caught their sorrowful expression,  for I was startled by a sharp voice near me, saying, \"What's the  matter?\" I turned to reply, and found the inquiry was made by a grey  parrot, who introduced himself as \"Pretty Poll,\" and was ready to make  friends to any extent. But my attention had been caught by seeing what  looked like a nuthatch: only it was moping and ill, with eyes shut and  feathers ruffled. I asked about it, and was told it had some injury to  its foot, and was unsaleable, as the woman feared it would not live. I  made a bid for it, and it was accepted. I confess I was not sorry to  leave the stilling air of the shop and bring my new pet home. I fitted  up a large cage with pieces of wood and tree-bark, a pan for bathing,  sand, and fine gravel; a bone with a little meat upon it hung from the  roof of the cage, and other suitable food was placed in a tin. The poor  birdie was a pitiable object for some days; she ate now and then, but  remained for the most part quite still, with closed eyes, from morning  till night. Then she began to creep up and down the small tree-stem I  had placed in the cage. She took a bath and plumed herself, and in less  than a fortnight she became quite well and vigorous, and very amusing  in a variety of ways. Never was there a more active, busy little  creature.    Her characteristic was life, so she was named \"Zoee,\" and before long she  seemed to recognize her name, and would give an answering chirp. The  pieces of bark appeared to afford a never-failing interest. They were  examined and investigated in every crevice. Like a little woodpecker  hanging head downwards, Zoee would hammer at a nut fixed in the cracks of  the bark, and would hide away unfortunate mealworms not required for  immediate use.    Zoee regularly honeycombed the little tree-stem with her incessant  hammering, and in the numerous holes thus made she kept her supply of  food. No sooner was her tin filled with small pieces of raw meat than  she began stowing them all away for future use. She seemed to exercise a  good deal of thought about the matter; a morsel would be put in and out  of a hole half a dozen times before it was considered settled and  suitable, and then it had to be well rammed in and fixed, and off went  the busy little creature to fetch another piece, and so on, till all  was disposed of, and the tin left empty. Zoee was greatly exercised by a  half-opened Brazil nut: it was too large to fix into the bark, it would  not keep steady while she pecked at it, and yet there were good things  inside which must be obtained. I watched her various devices with great  amusement. She hung head downwards from the tree-stem and hammered at it  on the ground, but it shifted about, and she made no way; then she  carried it in her beak and tried fitting it into various places. I hope  she did not swear at it, but she seemed to think the thing was  possessed, for it was not like the ordinary nuts: she could manage them;  they would go into holes in the bark; this wouldn't fit anywhere, and  yet she could not give it up. At last, by a bright inspiration, she got  it fixed into a space between the tree-stem and the side of the cage.  Now she was in high glee, and all the household might have heard the  rapping that went on while she scooped out the inside and chipped off  pieces to be hidden carefully away in some secret place.    Zoee had a "]]]
