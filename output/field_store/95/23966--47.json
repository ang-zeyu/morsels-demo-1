As a consequence, he, of course, refrained  from any further attack. Since the vessel remained afloat, he had no  occasion to concern himself further with the boats which had been  launched.    \"It results from this that without a doubt that attack on the steamer  Nebraskan was not meant for the American flag, nor is it traceable to  any fault on the part of the commander of the German submarine, but is  to be considered an unfortunate accident.

This, said Sir A. Norman Hill,  Secretary of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association, speaking at  Liverpool yesterday, showed that the Germans had failed in their  attempt to blockade British ports.    On these 20,000 voyages the Germans had captured or destroyed only  twenty-nine ships, he continued. What did that represent? Ships which  had sailed in and out of Liverpool had completed in safety 998 out of  every 1,000 voyages upon which they started. That was a magnificent  record, he held, of perils faced and overcome.      FIRST WEEK WITH NO LOSS    _An Associated Press dispatch of July 22 from London remarked:_    So far as British vessels were concerned, the German submarines drew a  blank during the week ended yesterday. Not a single British merchant  ship or fishing craft was sunk.    It was the first week since the war began that some loss to British  shipping had not been occasioned by German cruisers, mines, or  submarines.    During the week 1,326 vessels of more than 300 tons each arrived at or  departed from ports of the United Kingdom.    The German war-zone decree went into effect on February 18. Since then  the weekly losses of ships and lives from torpedoes have been as  follows:    _Week Ending_    _Vessels._   _Lives._  February 25         11           9  March 4              1           0  March 11             7          38  March 18             6          13  March 25             7           2  April 1             13         165  April 8              8          13  April 15             4           0  April 22             3          10  April 29             3           0  May 6               24           5  May 13               2       1,260  May 20               7          13  May 27               7           7  June 3              19          32  June 10             36          21  June 17             19          19  June 24              3           1  July 1               9          29  July 8              15           2  July 15             12          13  July 22              2           0                     ---       -----  Total              218       1,652    Of the two vessels torpedoed in the week of July 22, the Russian  steamer Balwa was attacked on July 16. On the following day another  Russian steamer, the General Radetzky, was torpedoed. Both hailed from  Riga, and the crews of both were saved.      WARFARE MODIFIED?    _A record reported to have been compiled chiefly from British  Admiralty sources since the sinking of the Lusitania was published by  The New York American on July 13, showing that out of 122 ships sunk  by German submarines in the war zone, every passenger or sailor was  saved on all but 14. Following is The American's summary:_    Total number of ships definitely reported  sunk by German submarines  in sixty-four days, since the  Lusitania was torpedoed                       122    Number of ships on which any loss  of life occurred                               14    [Note: Some of these fatalities  occurred, according to British Admiralty  reports, either from explosion  of torpedoes or from upsetting  of lifeboats, or from gunfire of submarines  while the enemy ship was  trying to escape.]    Total loss of life on 122 ships, from  all causes                                    131      GERMAN ACCOUNTS    _In a Berlin dispatch of July 14, by wireless to Sayville, Long  Island, the following was given out by the Overseas News Agency:_    During the month of June twenty-nine British, three French, one  Belgian, and nine Russian merchantmen were sunk by German submarines.    The total loss of the Entente Allies by submarines, including fishing  steamers, which mostly were armed patrol boats, aggregated 125,000  tons.    The loss of human life was remarkably small, the submarines using  every precaution and giving ample warning and time for crews to leave  their ships if no resistance was attempted.    _The total of losses in ships of the Allies' merchant marine around  the English coast in the period between February 18 (the beginning of  the German submarine war zone) and May 18, as compiled from German  data, was published in the Frankfurter Zeitung of June 6. This  publication, the first issue from German quarters, contains also a  list of the various allied ships sunk, totaling 111, together with the  nationality and tonnage of each, and a charted map of the British  Isles showing where each ship was sunk._    _In describing the achievements of the German submarine against their  foes--the neutral ships sunk are not included--the Frankfurter  Zeitung's article says:_    In the period of three months since the 18th of February, a day  memorable for history, our submarines have inflicted on the enemy  merchant shipping, in the first place the English merchant marine, a  total loss of 111 ships with a displacement of 234,239 tons. The  figures may, perhaps, not seem especially large in comparison with the  gigantic number of merchant ships flying the flag of the enemy. But in  this method of warfare the percentage loss of ships of our opponent as  compared with his total does not count, but rather the fact that  through the regularity and inevitableness of the marine catastrophes  the enemy shipping shall be disturbed as poignantly as possible, and  that there should as a result of this disturbance appear in the  economic life of England phenomena similar to those which the English  plan of the isolation of Germany aims at without, however, having  succeeded in getting any nearer to its goal, owing to the inherent  strength and power of adaptation of German business.    The rise of prices now prevalent in England, and the paralyzing of  great branches of trade which could not occur in an England that  really ruled the sea, may be attributed in chief part to this war of  the submarines. The advantage of the insular position of England has  been greatly lessened, thanks to this excellent German weapon, even if  it cannot be completely eliminated. But if one compares with the total  voyages of the English merchant shipping the losses of the English  merchant marine, amounting to more than 100 ships in a period of  exactly ninety days, and a tonnage of 216,000 tons, (from the totals  mentioned above there must be deducted the shares of France and  Russia,) then we must consider only that part of the British merchant  marine that entered ports of the island kingdom in this period or left  them; and one must bear in mind further that a large number of those  ships is contained several times in the English statistics, since they  do coast service.    But as valuable booty for our submarines particularly those ships are  to be regarded that import any kinds of commodities to England. And  statistics will later be able to show on the basis of these figures  the great success of the German submarine warfare, as indicated by  figures.    A glance at the map that accompanies the list of losses suffices to  show that mine fields as little as great distances are factors of  decisive importance in the activities of our submarines. The closing  of the English Channel and of the North Channel (between Ireland and  Scotland) has not prevented our boats from penetrating wherever there  was booty. Even on the northwest coast of Scotland and out in the west  of Ireland the German submarines have carried on a successful hunt.  The numbers in the little circles on the map represent the successive  ships on the list.    _The Frankfurter Zeitung adds figures given by the British Admiralty  on the same subject. These, it says, total 130 merchant ships with a  registered tonnage of 457,000 tons, from the beginning of the war to  May 26. Added to these, it says, are 83 fishing vessels with a tonnage  of 13,585 tons, making a total of 213 ships with 470,585 tons. It  says:_    These figures, however, are certainly incomplete, inasmuch as up to  March 16 there had already been announced 145 ships with a total  tonnage of 500,000 as lost, and the figures published by us above,  based upon authentic material, concerning the victims of our  submarines in three months, contradict beyond any power of dispute the  euphemistic presentation of the British Admiralty. Even so, however,  the English list still shows that since the beginning of the submarine  warfare, although in that period there was little to speak of in the  way of activities of the German cruisers abroad, the damage done to  the English fleet has risen according to the confession of the  Admiralty itself. Since Feb. 18, that is to say, since scarcely more  than a quarter of a year, according to the English figures, no less  than 56 British merchant ships with a tonnage of 187,000 tons (that is  to say, more than 40 per cent. of the total number of merchant ships  designated as lost) have been sunk. But if instead of these English  figures the German compilation, which is indubitably correct, be  accepted, then the entire picture changes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#8)"],[1,"fruit a good fertilizer can  be produced.    The chemical examination of the cinders of the coffee bean shows that it  contains 65.25 per cent of potash, 12.53 per cent of phosphoric acid,  11.00 per cent of magnesia, 6.12 per cent of lime, and some traces of  sulphuric and salicylic acid, oxide of iron and chlorine.    An interesting study has been made by Dr. Dafert of the weight of the  various components of the coffee tree at different ages, from which it  appears that the proportion of potash increases progressively in the  organs as they are more and more distant from the roots. The contrary is  the case with lime and phosphoric acid, which preponderate generally in  the seeds.    With this knowledge a scientific cultivator can judge exactly how to  treat the exigencies of the different trees at different ages. Naturally,  the condition of the soil has to be taken into consideration in any case.  According to experiments made by Dr. Dafert each kilo of coffee beans has  extracted from the soil--potash 0.7880 gramme; phosphoric acid 0.4020  gramme; magnesia 0.3240 gramme; lime 0.1470 gramme.    These experiments apply merely to coffee grown in Brazil, and are no  doubt at variance with experiments on coffee grown elsewhere. Taking all  things into consideration, it has been proved by chemical analysis that  the Brazilian coffee comes as near as any in its components to what the  normal or perfect coffee should be.    The soil, the elevation of the land, the zone and the climate naturally  have considerable influence on the quality of the coffee. The _Coffea  Arabica_ seems to feel happy enough in a temperate zone and at elevations  from 1,500 to 2,300 ft. The States of Sao Paulo, Minas Geraes, Rio de  Janeiro and Espirito Santo fulfil most if not all these conditions.    [Illustration: Dr. Passos.]    The coffee trees can stand cold--if not of long duration--down to  freezing-point, as well as a fairly high temperature. Unlike the Liberia  coffee, they fare better on undulating or broken ground than on the flat.    Two distinct seasons--the dry and the rainy--each of about six months'  duration--such as are found in the above-mentioned States of Brazil, seem  perfectly to suit the growth of the coffee trees. The trees are in bloom  for three or four days some time during the months of September to  December. If the rains are not abundant when the trees are in blossom,  and during the maturing of the fruits, the latter do not develop  properly, especially those at the end of the branches, where the berries  become dry before their time or even do not form. If the rain comes too  long before the trees are in bloom it causes the blossoms to open before  their time and they are frequently spoiled by the cold which follows. The  coffee beans are collected in April, during the dry weather.    The coffee trees are very sensitive to winds, cold or hot, especially  when blowing continuously in the same direction, which causes the undue  fall of leaves and rupture of the bark at the neck of the roots. Wind,  indeed, is one of the most dangerous enemies of coffee trees, and it is  to obviate this danger that in many countries--but not in Brazil--a  protecting plantation in lines of other trees--generally useful fruit  trees--is adopted in order to screen the coffee trees from the prevailing  wind, as well as to give a further income from the fruit produced.    It has been proved that even from good trees below a certain altitude the  coffee is of inferior quality, while above that height the crop becomes  irregular. In zones fully exposed to the sun the quality is superior to  that of regions where the sun does not reach or only reaches for a short  portion of the day.    The _Coffea Arabica_ is not particularly exacting in the quality of the  soil, but the soil on which it flourishes best is that formed in great  part by decomposed vegetable matter--as, for instance, from ancient trees  mixed with volcanic earth, such as the famous red earth of the State of  Sao Paulo. Volcanic cinders also are said to be wonderful fertilizers for  the soil, and well adapted for the welfare of coffee trees.    One thing is undoubted, and that is that the State of Sao Paulo possesses  the ideal soil for coffee plantations. Analysis has shown that, curiously  enough, the soil of Sao Paulo is not in itself very rich. It has an  insufficient quantity of fertilizing substances, particularly of lime;  but it should not be forgotten that locality and climatic conditions must  be taken into serious consideration, and that we must not be misled by  the difference between the apparent and the real fertility of the soil.  What would be a poor soil in Europe may prove to be an excellent one in a  tropical country. So the famous \"red earth\" of Sao Paulo, which in a  drier climate would be sterile and unproductive, is there excellent  because of its extremely permeable, porous and powdery qualities.    The special terms used for naming the different kinds of earth suitable  for the cultivation of coffee are: _terra roxa_ (red earth), _massape_,  _salmorao_, _catanduva_, _terra de areia_ (sand earth), _picarra_ (stony  earth), and _pedreguelho_ (stony earth).    The _terra roxa_ is an argillaceous, ferruginous earth of diabasic  origin, occasionally mixed with sand. It contains salicylic acid, oxide  of iron, alumina, phosphoric acid, oxide of manganese, lime, magnesia,  potash and soda.    The _massape_, originally decomposed gneiss-granitic rock mixed with  clay, contains oxide of iron. Its occasional blackness is due to the  decomposed vegetable matter it embodies.    The _salmorao_ includes in its formation small stones indicating the  incomplete decomposition of the rock from which it originates.    The _catanduva_--which is of inferior quality--is composed of much  disintegrated vegetable matter and fine dust.    The names of the other kinds of earth well denote their quality.    One reason why coffee cultivation is so popular in Brazil is because of  the general belief that no trouble is required to look after the trees--a  very mistaken notion indeed. There is a marked difference between  plantations carefully looked after and those that are not. More than  usual care must be taken to select the seed for new plantations. The  young plants must get strong in a nursery and then be transplanted into  proper soil, the prudent distance between trees being generally from 9 to  12 ft. For the convenience of collecting the beans and keeping the soil  clean, a perfect alignment in all directions is necessary. The most  suitable month for planting coffee in Brazil, according to the authority  of Dr. Dafert, is the month of July.    Great care must be taken of the trees themselves and of the soil around  the trees, which must be kept clean and absolutely free from grass. The  capillary roots of the trees extending horizontally near the surface of  the soil are much affected by the presence of any other vegetation, and  by the collection of insects which this produces and harbours. Frost,  rain, and the heat of the sun naturally affect the trees more when the  soil is dirty than when kept clean. Many of the coffee estates suffer  considerably from insufficient labour. The effects of this are quickly  visible on the trees. Artificial fertilization is useful, even necessary  after a number of years, and so is careful pruning in order to keep the  trees healthy, strong and clean.    [Illustration: A Beautiful Waterfall at Theresopolis.]    [Illustration: Antonio Prado's Coffee Estate.]    Coffee trees have many natural enemies--chiefly vegetable and animal  parasites--which mostly attack the leaves. The _Ramularia Goeldiana_, a  parasite not unlike the _Cercospora Coffeicola_, is one of the worst, and  undoubtedly the chief offender in Brazil, although great is the number of  insects prejudicial to the trees. The most terrible of all, perhaps, are  the ants and termites, such as the _Termes opacus_, which attack and  destroy the roots of young trees. The _cupim_ (_Termes album_) or white  ant, and the _carregador_ or _Sauba_, a giant ant with which we shall get  fully acquainted later on our journey, are implacable enemies of all  plants. Also the _quen-quen_, another kind of ant. These ants are so  numerous that it is almost an impossibility to extirpate them. Various  ways are suggested for their destruction, but none are really effective.  Certain larvae, flies and cochinilla, owing to their sucking habits,  deposit on the leaves and branches a viscous sugary substance, which, on  account of the heat, causes fermentation known locally as _fumagina_.  This produces great damage. Birds pick and destroy the berries when ripe;  and caterpillars are responsible for the absolute devastation of many  coffee districts in the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo States. Other pests  of the _Heteroptera_ type attack the roots to such an extent as to cause  the death of the trees.    Among the diseases of the trees are the _Aphelencus Coffeae_ and the  _Loranthus brasiliensis_--the latter a terrible parasite which quickly  envelops the stem and branches of the tree and ends by killing it.    The collection of the berries is the busiest process in the fazendas, and  has to be performed with considerable care, for some of the berries are  already ripe and dried when others hidden under the branches have not yet  reached the required degree of maturity. An experienced hand can collect  from 400 to 450 litres of coffee berries per day. It takes an average of  100 litres of coffee berries to produce 15 kilos of prepared coffee beans  ready to be shipped. The crop is not the same every year. After one  plentiful crop there generally succeeds one year, sometimes two or three,  of poor--almost insignificant--collections, varying according to the care  that is taken of the trees and the soil.    When once the coffee has been collected and transported to the fazenda in"]]]
