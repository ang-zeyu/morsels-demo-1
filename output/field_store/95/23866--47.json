Nearly every day of snow they passed her  house. She always heard them talking, and usually she heard, across at  the corner, the click of the penny-in-the-slot machine, which no child  seemed able to pass without pulling. To-night, as she heard them coming,  Mary fumbled in her purse. Three, four, five pennies she found and ran  across the street and dropped them in the slot machine, and gained her  own door before the children came. She stood at her dark threshold, and  listened. She had not reckoned in vain. One of the children pushed down  on the rod, in the child's eternal hope of magic, and when magic came  and three, four, five chocolates dropped obediently in their hands, Mary  listened to what they said. It was not much, and it was not very  coherent, but it was wholly intelligible.    \"Look at!\" shrieked Bennet, who had made the magic.    \"_Did_ it?\" cried Gussie, and repeated the operation.    \"It--it--it never!\" said Tab Winslow, at the third.    \"Make it again--make it again!\" cried little Emily, and they did.    \"Gorry,\" observed Pep, in ecstasy.    When it would give no more, they divided with the other children and ran  on, their red mittens and mufflers flaming in the snow. Mary stood  staring after them for a moment, then she closed her door.    \"I wonder what made me do that,\" she thought.    In her dining room she mended the fire without taking off her hat. It  was curious, she reflected; here was this room looking the way it  looked, and away off there was the little fellow who had never seen the  room; and in a little while he would be calling this room home, and  looking for his books and his mittens, and knowing it better than any  other place in the world. And there was Jenny, with that bottom  drawerful, and pretty soon somebody that now was not, would be, and  would be wearing the drawerful and calling Jenny \"mother,\" and would  know her better than any one else in the world. Mary could not imagine  that little boy of Lily's getting used to her--Mary--and calling  her--well, what would he call her? She hadn't thought of that....    \"Bother,\" thought Mary Chavah, \"there's going to be forty nuisances  about it that I s'pose I haven't even thought of yet.\"    She stood by the window. She had not lighted the lamp, so the world  showed white, not black. Snow makes outdoors look big, she thought. But  it was big--what a long journey it was to Idaho. Suppose ... something  happened to the man he was to travel with. John Blood was only a boy; he  would probably put the child's name and her address in the little  traveler's pocket, and these would be lost. The child was hardly old  enough to remember what to do. He would go astray, and none of them  would ever know what had become of him ... and what would become of him?  She saw him and his bundle of clothes alone in the station in the  City....    She turned from the window and mechanically mended the fire again. She  drew down the window shade and went to the coat closet to hang away her  wraps. Then abruptly she took up her purse, counted out the money in the  firelight, and went out the door and down the street in the dusk, and  into the post office, which was also the telegraph office,--one which  the little town owed to Ebenezer Rule, and it a rival to the other  telegraph office at the station.    \"How much does it cost to send a telegram?\" she demanded. \"Idaho,\" she  answered the man's question, flushing at her omission.    While the man, Affer by name, laboriously looked it up,--covering  incredible little dirty figures with an incredibly big dirty  forefinger,--Mary stood staring at the list of names tacked below the  dog-eared Christmas Notice. She remembered that she had not yet signed  it herself. She asked for a pencil--causing confusion to the little  figures and delay to the big finger--and, while she waited, wrote her  name. \"A good, sensible move,\" she thought, as she signed.    When Affer gave her the rate, thrusting finger and figures jointly  beneath the bars,--solicitous of his own accuracy,--Mary filed her  message. It was to John Blood, and it read:----    \"Be sure you tie his tag on him good.\"          VII      Ebenezer Rule had meant to go to the City before cold weather came. He  had there a small and decent steam-warmed flat where he boiled his own  eggs and made his own coffee, read his newspapers and kept his counsel,  descending nightly to the ground-floor cafe to dine on ambiguous dishes  at tables of other bank swallows who nested in the same cliff. But as  the days went by, he found himself staying on in Old Trail Town, with  this excuse and that, offered by himself to himself. As, for example,  that in the factory there were old account books that he must go  through. And having put off this task from day to day and finding at  last nothing more to dally with, he set out one morning for the ancient  building down in that part of the village which was older than the rest  and was where his business was conducted when it was conducted.    It had snowed in the night, and Buff Miles, who drove the village  snowplow, was also driver of \"the 'bus.\" So on the morning after a  snowfall, the streets always lay buried thick until after the 8.10  Express came in; and since on the morning following a snowfall the 8.10  Express was always late, Old Trail Town lay locked in a kind of circular  argument, and everybody stayed indoors or stepped high through drifts.  The direct way to the factory was virtually untrodden, and Ebenezer made  a detour through the business street in search of some semblance of a  \"track.\"    The light of a Winter morning is not kind, only just. It is just to the  sky and discovers it to be dominant; to trees, and their lines are seen  to be alive, like leaves; to folk, and no disguise avails. Summer gives  complements and accessories to the good things in a human face. Winter  affords nothing save disclosure. In the uncompromising cleanness of that  wash of Winter light, Ebenezer Rule was himself, for anybody to see.  Looking like countless other men, lean, alert, preoccupied, his tall  figure stooped, his smooth, pale face like a photograph too much  retouched, this commonplace man took his place in the day almost as one  of its externals. With that glorious pioneer trio, mineral, vegetable  and animal; and with intellect, that worthy tool, he did his day's work.  His face was one that had never asked itself, say, of a Winter morning:  _What else?_ And the Winter light searched him pitilessly to find that  question somewhere in him.    Before the Simeon Buck North American Dry Goods Exchange, Simeon Buck  himself had just finished shoveling his walk, and stood wiping his snow  shovel with an end of his muffler. When he saw Ebenezer, he shook the  muffler at him, and then, over his left shoulder, jabbed the air with  his thumb.    \"Look at here,\" he said, his head reenforcing his gesture toward his  show window, \"look what I done this morning. Nice little touch--eh?\"    In the show window of the Exchange--Dry Goods Exchange was just the name  of it for the store carried everything--a hodgepodge of canned goods,  lace curtains, kitchen utensils, wax figures, and bird cages had been  ranged round a center table of golden oak. On the table stood a figure  that was as familiar to Old Trail Town as was its fire engine and its  sprinkling cart. Like these, appearing intermittently, the figure had  seized on the imagination of the children and grown in association until  it belonged to everybody, by sheer use and wont. It was a _papier-mache_  Santa Claus, three feet high, white-bearded, gray-gowned, with tall  pointed cap--rather the more sober Saint Nicholas of earlier days than  the rollicking, red-garbed Saint Nick of now. Only, whereas for years he  had graced the window of the Exchange, bearing over his shoulder a  little bough of green for a Christmas tree, this season he stood  treeless, and instead bore on his shoulder a United States flag. On a  placard below him Simeon had laboriously lettered:--        High Cost of Living      and too much fuss      Makes Folks want a      Sane Christmas      Me Too.   S. C.    \"Ain't that neat?\" said Simeon.    Ebenezer looked. \"What's the flag for?\" he inquired dryly.    \"Well,\" said Simeon, \"he had to carry something. I thought of a toy  gun--but that didn't seem real appropriate. A Japanese umbrella wasn't  exactly in season, seems though. A flag was about the only thing I could  think of to have him hold. A flag is always kind of tasty, don't you  think?\"    \"Oh, it's harmless,\" Ebenezer said, \"harmless.\"    \"No hustling business,\" Simeon pursued, \"can be contented with just  _not_ doing something. It ain't enough not to have no Christmas. You've  got to find something that'll express nothing, and express it forcible.  In business, a minus sign,\" said Simeon, \"is as good as a plus, if you  can keep it whirling round and round.\"    This Ebenezer mulled and chuckled over as he went on down the street. He  wondered what the Emporium would do to keep up with the Exchange. But in  the Emporium window there was nothing save the usual mill-end display  for the winter white goods sale.    Ebenezer opened the store door and put his head in.    \"Hey,\" he shouted at Abel, back at the desk, \"can't you keep up with  Simeon's window?\"    Abel came down the aisle between the lengths of white stuff plaited into  folds at either side. The fire had just been kindled in the stove, and  the air in the store was still frosty. Abel, in his overcoat, was  blowing on his fingers.    \"I ain't much of any heart to,\" said he, \"but the night before Christmas  I guess'll do about right for mine.\"    \"What'll you put up?\" Ebenezer asked, closing the door behind him.    \"Well, sir,\" said Abel, \"I ain't made up my mind full"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#8)"],[1,"ges,  another was sleeping. They were not ready and, caught unexpectedly,  were dispersed.    Austro-Hungarian prestige is severely wounded. The shameful treason  shows how dangerous is the Pan-Servian propaganda to the integrity of  the Austrian Empire, when corruption has reached even the officers  standing in high command.    The Austro-Hungarian General Staff, as we are informed, has already  taken those measures imposed by the situation. The Generals, Frank and  Potiorek, have been recalled and will be probably court-martialed. And  it seems that the \"brilliant\" Servian victories are the beginning of  the end of the \"Slav Belgium.\"      GREECE ACCLAIMS.    _The following editorial article, headed \"A New Marathon\" on the  Servian victory, appeared in the Greek newspaper Patris of Athens on  Dec. 3, (16, New Style,) 1914, expressing the views of the Hellenic  Government:_    The reoccupation of Belgrade by the Servians is one of those military  feats which amount to historical phenomena. The Servians not only  contributed the greatest feat of the European war, as far as results  are concerned, but won for themselves an immortal page in the world's  history.    Greece alone has to show an analogous achievement, although greater,  when she expelled the Persian invasion.    Only the achievements of Arhangelovatz, Ouzhitse, and Lazarevats can  compare in a certain degree to the brilliancy of Marathon and Plateae.  And the Servian achievement appears all the more Hellenic if analogies  are to be considered.    The Servians, until yesterday a little people, with an army almost  insignificant in face of the masses of the Austrian columns,  submissive in times of peace, in the face of the most oppressive  demands of Austrian diplomacy--considered like all the small peoples  to be living at the mercy of the great--when the hour of supreme  defense for altars and hearths struck, and in the face of an enemy  threatening to swallow their country, they arose, terrible in their  vengeance, and repeated the feat of the routing of Goliath by their  small but invincible power.    This was possible because their regiments were not moved by the hope  of effectively beating the enemy, which hope springs from the  consciousness of numerical superiority, but they were enlivened and  strengthened before death by the undying fire of freedom, national  pride, and the conviction that they were thrust into the most honored  struggle, after which there would not be left for them anything but to  live or die.    And the Austrians, who considered their campaign against Servia as  mere child's play; the Austrians with their German military  organization; the Austrians, who constitute one-sixth of the entire  European military power, started against Servia with the same logic,  the same haughtiness, the same bombastic prediction of the result of  the unequal war with which the Persian masses moved against  Greece....          Little Montenegro Speaks      _The following Montenegrin message to Italy appeared in La Gazetta del  Popolo of July 21, (Aug. 3,) 1914:_    This terrible European war, if one takes away from it the diplomatic  ornaments with which the Chancelleries are wont to decorate it, dates  from a century back. It is, let us hope, the final revolt of the  nations oppressed by the unjust work of the Congress of Vienna.    The nationalities of which the powers of the Triple Entente, and  especially Russia, have made themselves the champions have not  provoked this bloody struggle. It was imposed on them by the  reactionary spirit of the Germanic world, which desired to consolidate  its hegemony, based on the sufferings of the weak, impossible to  describe, and on the contempt of right, which was proclaimed as a  system of government.    The neutrality observed up to now by your august Italian country has  been a powerful assistance to the cause of right against the cause of  oppression.    We Serbs of Montenegro and Servia are now on the point of conquering  that national unity, which our poets, our thinkers, and our sovereigns  have sung, implored, and prepared, and, following the trail opened by  Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi, we put our confidence in Italy, this  mother of civilization, who by her smile embellishes the sun-kissed  Slav shores of the Adriatic.    Help us in conquering the place which is awaiting us at the altar of  justice! We firmly believe that Italy, when at the price of new  sacrifices she shall have all of her exiled sons united under her  glorious standard, will inaugurate a new era of friendly and intimate  connections with the young Slav world, who from her hands received so  many benefits and who in exchange offers her the collaboration of  young and enthusiastic people in the great task undertaken by our  protectors in the name of civilization and liberty.          Bulgaria's Attitude    Speech From the Throne    By Tsar Ferdinand I.      _The following speech by Tsar Ferdinand I. of Bulgaria was read at the  opening of the Bulgarian Parliament, called the Sobranje, on Oct. 15,  (28,) 1914, by the Prime Minister, Mr. Radoslavoff._    With the ending last year of a long and exhausting struggle which we  conducted with incomparable self-denial, the Bulgarian people and my  Government directed again their efforts toward the healing of the  wounds of the recent past and the remodeling of the national forces,  and likewise toward creating new resources and prosperity for the  country.    Our common peaceful activity was interrupted by the breaking out of  the greatest and most terrible of all wars that history has up to this  day recorded. In face of this mighty struggle of the European nations  my Government has deemed it its duty before the nation, and the course  imposed on it, to declare the neutrality of Bulgaria and to maintain  this attitude sternly and honestly according to international  obligations and the interests of the fatherland.    Thanks to this process, my Government maintains good and friendly  relations with all the great powers; has succeeded in giving to our  relations with our neighbors a color of greater confidence, so  necessary after the crisis of the last year, and in the midst of the  events that lie heavy today on the whole of Europe.    _A supplemental statement of the royal position was made by the  Bulgarian Premier, Mr. Radoslavoff, in the Sobranje at the sitting of  Nov. 12, (25,) 1914, which follows:_    With the proclamation of the state of siege, taken in accordance with  the decision of Parliament, as a measure of further security,  everything is moving along according to the laws and the Constitution  of the country. And the Government is endeavoring that the internal  administration may proceed in as orderly a way as possible.    You remember very well that on the 16th (29th) of July, when war was  declared by Austria-Hungary, I came here and told you that the  decision of the Government was to maintain strict neutrality.    One day before the closing of the extra session of Parliament I  repeated the declarations of the Government, that no matter what kind  of political combinations were formed around us the Government is  resolved to maintain absolute neutrality to the end.    It was with pleasure that I heard at that time the assurances of all  the party leaders that if I were to keep this attitude they would help  me maintain the absolute neutrality of Bulgaria.    I do not know why after a few days there have been published various  statements signed by the different party leaders.    Nothing in particular had been done on our side up to that time. There  was nothing irregular, but, notwithstanding all this, complaints have  been lodged against the Bulgarian Government that its neutrality was  one-sided, that the Government was favoring one group of the powers  while hostile to the other, that through Bulgaria arms and ammunition  were sent from a belligerent country [Germany] to a non-belligerent,  [Turkey,] and this moved the leaders of the parties to turn to the  nation and denounce the sincerity of your Government.    The silence of the nation and the attitude of the powers gave us full  justification for the fairness and loyalty with which we keep our  neutrality.    Two months ago the nation had witnessed a manifesto, signed by all the  party leaders with the exception of the narrow Socialists, which means  that the opposition has not been united on this question, as it is  said in the manifesto that all the opposition was united in a fear  lest the Government abandon its neutrality. In the manifesto addressed  to the Bulgarian nation the desire was expressed for the formation of  a Ministry in which all the political parties were to be represented.    But the silence of the nation has given ample proof of its confidence  in the present Ministry. The declaration of the Government on July 13  (26) holds today, as it held then. We are keeping the strict  neutrality of Bulgaria. Those that were supposed to have grievances  against us have no proofs to show our breach of neutrality. Every side  was satisfied with our assurances.    Notwithstanding the difficulties with which the path of the Government  is strewn today, I, supported by the majority of the Parliament, will  follow the same policy. Bulgaria has remained neutral, and up to now  she is in excellent relations with all neighboring countries.    Bulgaria is in most friendly relations with Rumania, Greece, and  Servia, which is at war. Bulgaria keeps the most sincere relations  with Turkey. Bulgaria remains neutral and loyal in her position. I  make the declaration so that the entire nation may be informed that  the present Government has assured the territorial integrity of  Bulgaria.    Our policy meets with the approval of all the great powers without  exception. If we ever are led by the force of circumstances to enter  some arrangement whereby Bulgaria will obtain something more in the  way of "]]]
