Leaves scattered, spirally arranged in rows, at  right angles to twig, or disposed in two ranks like the hemlock; 1/2-1  inch long, dark glossy green on the upper surface, beneath silvery  bluish-white, and traversed lengthwise by rows of minute dots, flat,  narrowly linear; apex blunt, in young trees and upon vigorous shoots,  often slightly but distinctly notched, or sometimes upon upper branches  with a sharp, rigid point; sessile; aromatic.    =Inflorescence.=--Early spring. Lateral or terminal on shoots of the  preceding season; sterile flowers oblong-cylindrical, 1/4 inch in  length; anthers yellow, red-tinged: fertile flowers on the upper side of  the twig, erect, cylindrical; cover-scales broad, much larger than the  purple ovuliferous scales, terminating in a long, recurved tip.    =Fruit.=--Cones along the upper side of the branchlets, erect or nearly  so in all stages of growth, purplish when young, 3-5 inches long, 1 inch  or more wide; puberulous; cover-scales at maturity much smaller than  ovuliferous scales, thin, obovate, serrulate, bristle-pointed;  ovuliferous scales thin, broad, rounded; edge minutely erose, serrulate  or entire; both kinds of scales falling from the axis at maturity; seeds  winged, purplish.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England, but best adapted to the  northern sections; grows rapidly in open or shaded situations,  especially where there is cool, moist, rich soil; easily transplanted;  suitable for immediate effects in forest plantations, but not desirable  for a permanent ornamental tree, as it loses the lower branches at an  early period. Nurserymen and collectors offer it in quantity at a low  price. Propagated from seed.    [Illustration: PLATE X.--Abies balsamea.]      1. Branch with flower-buds.    2.

Southern Labrador to Nova Scotia; west to Manitoba.    Maine,--throughout the state; most abundant in the central and northern  portions, forming extensive areas known as \"cedar swamps\"; sometimes  bordering a growth of black spruce at a lower level; New  Hampshire,--mostly confined to the upper part of Coos county,  disappearing at the White river narrows near Hanover; seen only in  isolated localities south of the White mountains; Vermont,--common in  swamps at levels below 1000 feet; Massachusetts,--Berkshire county;  occasional in the northern sections of the Connecticut river valley;  Rhode Island,--not reported; Connecticut,--East Hartford (J. N. Bishop).         South along the mountains to North Carolina and East Tennessee;       west to Minnesota.    =Habit.=--Ordinarily 25-50 feet high, with a trunk diameter of 1-2 feet,  in northern Maine occasionally 60-70 feet in height, with a diameter of  3-5 feet; trunk stout, more or less buttressed in old trees, tapering  rapidly, often divided, inclined or twisted, ramifying for the most part  near the ground, forming a dense head, rather small for the size of the  trunk; branches irregularly disposed and nearly horizontal, the lower  often much declined; branchlets many, the flat spray disposed in  fan-shaped planes at different angles; foliage bright, often  interspersed here and there with yellow, faded leaves.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk in old trees a dead ash-gray, striate with broad  and flat ridges, often conspicuously spirally twisted, shreddy at the  edge; young stems and large branches reddish-brown, more or less striate  and shreddy; branchlets ultimately smooth, shining, reddish-brown,  marked by raised scars; season's twigs invested with leaves.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Leaf-buds naked, minute. Leaves in opposite  pairs, 4-ranked, closely adherent to the branchlet and completely  covering it, keeled in the side pairs and flat in the others,  scale-like, ovate (in seedlings needle-shaped), obtuse or pointed at the  apex, glandular upon the back, exhaling when bruised a strong aromatic  odor.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Flowers terminal, dark reddish-brown;  sterile and fertile, usually on the same plant, rarely on separate  plants; anthers opposite; filaments short; ovuliferous scales opposite,  with slight projections near the base, usually 2-ovuled.    =Fruit.=--Cones, terminal on short branchlets, spreading or recurved,  about 1/2 inch long, reddish-brown, loose-scaled, opening to the base at  maturity; persistent through the first winter; scales 6-12, dry, oblong,  not shield-shaped, not pointed; margin entire or nearly so; seeds winged  all round.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England; adapts itself to all soils  and exposures, but prefers moist locations; grows slowly. Young trees  have a narrowly conical outline, which spreads out at the base with age;  retains its lower branches in open places, and is especially useful for  hedges or narrow evergreen screens; little affected by insects; often  disfigured, however, by dead branches and discolored leaves; is  transplanted readily, and can be obtained in any quantity from  nurserymen and collectors. The horticultural forms in cultivation range  from thick, low, spreading tufts, through very dwarf, round, oval or  conical forms, to tall, narrow, pyramidal varieties. Some have all the  foliage tinged bright yellow, cream, or white; others have variegated  foliage; another form has drooping branches. The bright summer foliage  turns to a brownish color in winter. It is propagated from the seed and  its horticultural forms from cuttings and layers.    [Illustration: PLATE XI.--Thuja occidentalis.]      1. Flowering branch with the preceding year's fruit.    2.

P._    WHITE CEDAR. CEDAR.    =Habitat and Range.=--In deep swamps and marshes, which it often fills  to the exclusion of other trees, mostly near the seacoast.         Cape Breton island and near Halifax, Nova Scotia, perhaps       introduced in both.    Maine,--reported from the southern part of York county; New  Hampshire,--limited to Rockingham county near the coast; Vermont,--no  station known; Massachusetts,--occasional in central and eastern  sections, very common in the southeast; Rhode Island,--common;  Connecticut,--occasional in peat swamps.         Southward, coast region to Florida and west to Mississippi.    =Habit.=--20-50 feet high and 1-2 feet in diameter at the ground,  reaching in the southern states an altitude of 90 and a diameter of 4  feet; trunk straight, tapering slowly, throwing out nearly horizontal,  slender branches, forming a narrow, conical head often of great elegance  and lightness; foliage light brownish-green; strong-scented; spray flat  in planes disposed at different angles; wood permanently aromatic.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk thick, reddish, fibrous, shreddy, separating into  thin scales, becoming more or less furrowed in old trees; branches  reddish-brown; fine scaled; branches after fall of leaves, in the third  or fourth year, smooth, purplish-brown; season's shoots at first  greenish.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Leaf-buds naked, minute. Leaves mostly  opposite, 4-ranked, adherent to the branchlet and completely covering  it; keeled in the side pairs and slightly convex in the others, dull  green, pointed at apex or triangular awl-shaped, mostly with a minute  roundish gland upon the back.    =Inflorescence.=--April. Flowers terminal, sterile and fertile, usually  on the same plant, rarely on separate plants, fertile on short  branchlets: sterile, globular or oblong, anthers opposite, filaments  shield-shaped: fertile, oblong or globular; ovuliferous scales opposite,  slightly spreading at top, dark reddish-brown.    =Fruit.=--Cones, variously placed, 1/2 inch in diameter, roundish,  purplish-brown, opening towards the center, never to the base; scales  shield-shaped, woody; seeds several under each scale, winged.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England, growing best in  the southern sections. Young trees are graceful and attractive, but soon  become thin and lose their lower branches; valued chiefly in landscape  planting for covering low and boggy places where other trees do not  succeed as well. Seldom for sale in nurseries, but easily procured from  collectors. Several unimportant horticultural forms are grown.    [Illustration: PLATE XII.--Cupressus thyoides.]      1.

George (descanting on the glories of the \"crush of the season\")--\"The  music--the champagne--the----\"    Montague--\"Ah! yes; and how did 'mine host' bear himself?\"    George--\"The host! (ruefully).  B'Jove!  I forgot to hunt him up!\"      Unfortunately, mine host had allowed his surroundings to belittle  himself.  Many a brilliant \"social event\" might properly be chronicled  under the head-line: \"Total Eclipse of the Host!\" so insignificant does  the man become when he carries his standards of social entertaining in  his pocket-book instead of in his brains.    However, one need not be very rich in order to make this same mistake.  It is made every time that social life ceases to be social, and becomes  merely a contest of rival displays.  This folly is observed in small  villages quite as often as in the metropolis.  In contrast, how  refreshing it is to cross the threshold of a refined and cultivated  home, and find awaiting us a cordial welcome and a genuine hospitality,  so true to its author's personality and environment that whether water  or wine be offered we know not, grateful that our host gives us his  best, whatever it is, and, best of all, gives himself.          AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS AND TEAS    Fashions in entertaining have changed within the memory of \"those now  living.\"  Once, large parties were given, hundreds of invitations were  issued, a house was crowded from veranda to attic, and the occasion was  one of the few notable social events of the season.  Then came the  fashion--partly for exclusiveness, partly for novelty, largely for  convenience--of giving during the season several small parties or  receptions, which in the aggregate might include all of one's visiting  list.  The disadvantage of this plan, as an exclusive method of solving  the problem of social entertaining, was that slights were liable to  occur, and were sure to be bitterly felt and resented.  Yet, what was a  hostess to do?  To go back to the old-time crowded party, superadding  the increased luxury of modern entertaining, would be to re-establish  an inconvenient and expensive fashion.  But some way must be devised to  bring one's friends together, in larger numbers, and with more prompt  and direct expression of hospitality and good fellowship than could be  conveyed by the slow and stately process of a series of dinners.    \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\"  Someone, probably having  reflected upon the easy social character of the English five o'clock  tea, solved the problem for the American hostess by instituting the  afternoon reception, which, somewhere between the hours of four and  six, summons a host of friends to cross one's threshold and meet  informally, chatting for a while over a sociable cup of tea, each group  giving place to others, none crowding, all at ease, every one the  recipient of a gracious welcome from the hostess, who by the  hospitality thus offered has tacitly placed each guest on her visiting  list for the season.    The afternoon reception is much the same affair, whether it be a tea  merely, or a _musicale_, or a literary occasion.  If merely a  reception, conversation and the desultory chat of society, the drifting  about and the greeting of friends, and incidentally the cup of tea and  its dainty accessories, fill a half-hour or so very pleasantly; and  though inconsequent so far as any plan or motive is concerned, such  meeting and mingling may have all the desired effect as a promoter of  social pleasure and harmony.    When a _musicale_ is given at these afternoon hours, usually it is in  honor of some brilliant amateur, a pianist or singer, or, if the  program is miscellaneous, a gifted elocutionist.  Or, it is an occasion  when some lion of the professional stage has been captured, either  socially or professionally, and the hostess gives to her less fortunate  friends an opportunity to see and hear at close range the celebrity  usually visible only through opera-glasses and beyond the foot-lights.  Or, some lady of well-known musical taste may be the patron of some  newly-arrived professor of music; and she invites her musical friends  to meet him, with the benevolent purpose to give him a profitable  introduction to a promising class of patrons.    When under any of these or similar conditions a formal program is  arranged, the hour is fixed, and is stated on the invitation card; as  \"Music at 4.\"  The guests should be prompt at the hour, so that no  interruption or confusion shall occur.  When the reception is merely  social, guests come and leave at any time within the hours specified on  the invitation card; as, \"Tea, 4 to 6.\"    When admitted to the house each one hands a card to the servant in  waiting.  The guest repairs to the dressing-room to lay aside outer  wraps, and attend to any detail of the toilet which wind or accident  may have disarranged.  Upon entering the parlor each guest is greeted  by the hostess, who stands near the door, surrounded by her aids.  If  her husband's name appears on the card of invitation, he, also, is in  the receiving group, contributing, in so far as a man humbly may, to  the success of the occasion.  The aids, besides assisting in receiving  the guests, are attentive to entertaining; and they see that no shy  person is overlooked in the invitation to partake of refreshments.    The tea is served in the same room when the guests are few, and in  another room of the suite if the reception is large.  Usually a single  table is set, with coffee or chocolate at one end, and tea at the  other, served by young ladies, friends of the hostess.  To be invited  to preside at the coffee urn, or to manipulate the swinging tea-kettle,  is accounted a high compliment.    Besides the tea, the refreshments, which are served from the table, may  be very thin slices of bread and butter, or wafers, or similar trifles;  but if the occasion approaches the nature of a formal reception, a more  elaborate preparation is made; _bouillon_, oysters, salads, ice-cream  and cakes, delicate rolls and bon-bons may be offered.  The gradations  by which the frugal tea passes into the superabundant supper are not  easily classified.  Each hostess will judge how much or how little  prominence to give to these provisions for the inner man.  Usually,  however, very simple refreshments, daintily served, are all that is  desirable, as the guests go home to their dinners.    If a guest is a comparative stranger to others present, she is at  liberty to address any one in a chatty, agreeable way, without  introduction.  Also, if any one observes another guest who seems to be  alone and neglected, it is a graceful and kind overture to open a  pleasant conversation.    One should not linger too long at an afternoon tea.  Three-quarters of  an hour is a happy medium.    Allied to the afternoon tea are various phases of informal daytime  entertaining.  For example, there is the \"shower\" for a bride-elect  (\"linen,\" \"culinary,\" or what you will).  A friend of the bride-to-be  invites a coterie of girl friends to meet the guest of honor, giving  each girl time to provide some beautiful or useful gift, the  presentations to be made with amusing ceremonies.    The \"thimble bee,\" a favorite diversion of the quiet matronly set, each  one bringing her own bit of needlework to while away an hour or so in  pleasant conversation.  One of the number may read aloud, with pauses  for comment at will.  The thimble bee is a modern version of the good  old-fashioned \"spend the afternoon and take tea.\"  Both the shower and  the thimble bee may be given in the forenoon, if preferred.          THE DINNER SERVICE    REQUISITES FOR THE DINING-TABLE    _Table-Linen, etc._--Table-cloths of white damask, double or single, as  fine as the owner's purse admits, are used for the dinner-table, with  large square white napkins to correspond.    The table should first be covered with a mat of double-faced cotton  flannel wide enough to fall six inches below the edge of the table, all  around.  This under mat greatly improves the appearance of the  table-cloth, which can be laid much more smoothly over this soft  foundation.  Besides, the mat protects the table from too close contact  with hot dishes.  Small table mats for the purpose of protecting the  cloth are not fashionable at present, though many careful housekeepers  retain them rather than risk injury to fine table linen.    Carving-cloths are used when carving is done at the table, but are not  needed when dinner is served _a la Russe_.    Napkin rings are discarded by many who hold that a napkin should be  used but once, and must be re-laundried before reappearing on the table.    Practically, such a fastidious use of table linen would exhaust most  linen supplies, and overcrowd the laundry.  The neat use of a napkin  renders this extreme nicety superfluous as a rule of home dining, Care  should certainly be taken to remove all soiled table linen.  Nothing is  more disgusting than a dirty napkin, but the snowy linen that comes  spotless through one using may, with propriety, be retained in the ring  to be used several times.  This, of course, refers to every-day dining  at home.  On formal occasions no napkin rings appear on the table; the  napkins are always fresh, and used for that time only.  At the close of  the dinner they are left carelessly on the table; not rolled or folded  in any orderly shape.    Small fringed napkins of different colors are used with a dessert of  fruits.  Fancy doylies of fine linen embroidered with silk are  sometimes brought in with the finger-bowls; but these are not for  utility, the dinner napkin doing service, while the embroidered \"fancy\"  adds a dainty bit of "]]]
