The factors of musical  scholarship, personal magnetism, _et cetera_, mentioned in preceding  pages, must still constitute the real foundation of conducting. But  granting the presence of these other factors of endowment and  preparation, one may often achieve a higher degree of success if one  has developed also a well-defined and easily-followed beat. It is for  this reason that the technique of time beating is worthy of some  degree of serious investigation and of a reasonable amount of time  spent in practice upon it.          CHAPTER IV    INTERPRETATION IN CONDUCTING    INTRODUCTORY      [Sidenote: THE CONDUCTOR AS INTERPRETER]    Interpretation from the standpoint of the conductor differs from  interpretation in singing and playing in that the conductor must  necessarily convey ideas or emotions to his audience through an  intermediary, _viz._, the orchestra or chorus. He furthermore labors  under the disadvantage of having to stand with his back (certainly the  least expressive part of man's physique) to the audience. The pianist,  singer, and violinist, on the other hand, face their audiences; and  because they themselves actually do the performing, are able to work  much more directly upon the minds and emotions of their hearers. For  this reason, interpretation must be studied by the conductor from a  twofold basis:         1. From the standpoint of the expressive rendition of music       in general.         2. From the standpoint of securing the expressive rendition       of music from a group of players or singers.    We shall devote this and the three following chapters to a discussion  of these two phases of interpretation.    [Sidenote: INTERPRETATION AND EXPRESSION]    The word _interpret_, as ordinarily used means \"to explain,\"--\"to  elucidate,\"--\"to make clear the meaning of,\" and this same definition  of the word applies to music as well, the conductor or performer  \"making clear\" to the audience the message given him by the composer.  It should be noted at once, however, that interpretation in music is  merely the process or means for securing the larger thing called  _expression_, and in discussing this larger thing, the activity of two  persons is always assumed; one is the composer, the other the  performer. Which of these two is the more important personage has been  for many decades a much mooted question among concert-goers.  Considered from an intellectual standpoint, there is no doubt whatever  concerning the supremacy of the composer; but when viewed in the light  of actual box office experience, on an evening when Caruso or some  other popular idol has been slated to appear, and cannot do so because  of indisposition, it would seem as if the performer were still as far  above the composer as he was in the days of eighteenth-century opera  in Italy.    It is the composer's function to write music of such a character that  when well performed it will occasion an emotional reaction on the part  of performer and listener. Granting this type of music, it is the  function of the performer or conductor to so interpret the music that  an appropriate emotional reaction will actually ensue. A recent writer  calls the performer a _messenger_ from the composer to the audience,  and states[8] that--         As a messenger is accountable to both sender and recipient       of his message, so is the interpretative artist in a       position of twofold trust and, therefore, of _twofold       responsibility_. The sender of his message--creative       genius--is behind him; before him sits an expectant and       confiding audience, the sovereign addressee. The       interpretative artist has, therefore, first to enter into       the _spirit_ of his message; to penetrate its ultimate       meaning; to read in, as well as between, the lines. And then       he has to train and develop his faculties of delivery, of       vital production, to such a degree as to enable him to fix       his message decisively, and with no danger of being       misunderstood, in the mind of his auditor.    [Footnote 8: Constantin von Sternberg, _Ethics and Esthetics of Piano  Playing_, p. 10.]    This conception of the conductor's task demands from him two things:         1. A careful, painstaking study of the work to be performed,       so as to become thoroughly familiar with its content and to       discover its true emotional significance.         2. Such display of emotion in his conducting as will arouse       a sympathetic response, first on the part of orchestra and       chorus, and then in turn in the audience.    [Sidenote: EMOTION IN INTERPRETATION]    Real interpretation, then, requires, on the part of the conductor,  just as in the case of the actor, a display of emotion. Coldness and  self-restraint will not suffice, for these represent merely the  intellectual aspect of the art, and music is primarily a language of  the emotions. This difference constitutes the dividing line between  performances that merely arouse our judicial comment \"That was  exceedingly well done\"; and those on the other hand that thrill us,  carry us off our feet, sweep us altogether out of our environment so  that for the moment we forget where we are, lose sight temporarily of  our petty cares and grievances, and are permitted to live for a little  while in an altogether different world--the world not of things and  ambitions and cares, but of ecstasy. Such performances and such an  attitude on the part of the listener are all too rare in these days of  smug intellectualism and hypersophistication, and we venture to assert  that this is at least partly due to the fact that many present-day  conductors are intellectual rather than emotional in their attitude.    It is this faculty of displaying emotion, of entirely submerging  himself in the work being performed, that gives the veteran choral  conductor Tomlins his phenomenal hold on chorus and audience. In a  performance of choral works recently directed by this conductor, the  listener was made to feel at one moment the joy of springtime, with  roses blooming and lovers wooing, as a light, tuneful chorus in waltz  movement was being performed; then in a trice, one was whisked over to  the heart of Russia, and made to see, as though they were actually  present, a gang of boatmen as they toiled along the bank of the Volga  with the tow-rope over their shoulders, tugging away at a barge which  moved slowly up from the distance, past a clump of trees, and then  gradually disappeared around a bend in the river; and in yet another  moment, one was thrilled through and through with religious fervor in  response to the grandeur and majestic stateliness of the Mendelssohn  Motet, _Judge Me, oh God_.    It was interpretation of this type too that gave the actor-singer  Wuellner such a tremendous hold upon his audiences a few years ago,  this artist achieving a veritable triumph by the tremendous sincerity  and vividness of his dramatic impersonations in singing German  _Lieder_, in spite of the fact that he possessed a voice of only  average quality.    It was an emotional response of this character that the Greek  philosophers must have been thinking of when they characterized drama  as a \"purge for the soul\"; and surely it must still be good for human  beings to forget themselves occasionally and to become merged in this  fashion in the wave of emotion felt by performer and fellow-listener  in response to the message of the composer.    It is emotion of this type also that the great composers have sought  to arouse through their noblest compositions. Handel is said to have  replied, when congratulated upon the excellence of the entertainment  afforded by the _Messiah_, \"I am sorry if I have only entertained  them; I hoped to do them good.\" An English writer, in quoting this  incident, adds:[9]         What Handel tried to do ... by wedding fine music to an       inspiring text, Beethoven succeeded in doing through       instruments alone ... for never have instruments--no matter       how pleasing they were in the past--been capable of stirring       the inmost feelings as they have done since the beginning of       the nineteenth century.    [Footnote 9: C.F.A. Williams, _The Rhythm of Modern Music_, p. 13.]    There is danger, of course, here as everywhere, that one may go too  far; and it is entirely conceivable that both soloist and conductor  might go to such extremes in their display of emotion that the music  would be entirely distorted, losing what is after all its main _raison  d'etre_, _viz._, the element of beauty. But there seems at present to  be no especial danger that such an event will occur; the tendency  seems rather to be toward overemphasizing intellectualism in music,  and toward turning our art into a science.[10] The thing that we  should like to convince the prospective conductor of is that real  interpretation--_i.e._, genuinely expressive musical performance--demands  an actual display of emotion on the part of the conductor if the ideal  sort of reaction is to be aroused in the audience.    [Footnote 10: This danger is especially insidious just now in our  college and high school courses in the _appreciation of music_.  Instructors in such courses are often so zealous in causing pupils to  understand the _machinery_ involved in the construction and rendition  of music that they sometimes forget to emphasize sufficiently the  product resulting from all this machinery, _viz._, _beauty_. The idea  of these courses is most excellent, and in time those in charge of  them will doubtless realize that the hearing of actual music in the  classroom is more valuable to students than learning a mass of facts  about it; and that if a choice were necessary between a course in  which there was opportunity for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#8)"],[1,"not ride down the poor man,  as many knights would do.    But Balin, with a cheery call, said: 'Old man, give me thy pack, and do  thou climb up and sit behind me. For it is late and lonely that such  poor old bones as thine should be abroad.'    The old man, either from fear of the two great knights in their black  armour, or from suspicion, mumbled out a few words and refused the  offer, while yet he would not budge from the narrow path.    'Well, then, tell us thy name, old man,' said Balin, laughing at his  obstinacy.    'At this time I will not tell you,' croaked the old fellow, stumbling  under his pack.    'I doubt that great pack hath many rich things that never owned thee  master,' said Balan with a laugh.    'It is full evil seen,' said Balin, 'that thou art a true honest man,  when thou wilt not tell thy name.'    'Be that as it may,' snarled the old man, 'but I know your name, my  lordlings, and why you ride this way.'    'By the faith of my body, but ye are some wizard if ye know that,' said  Balan mockingly.    'And who may we be?' asked Balin. 'And whither do we ride?'    'Ye are brothers, my Lords Balin and Balan,' answered the old man. 'And  ye ride to pull King Rience's beard. But that ye shall not do, unless  ye take my counsel.'    'Ah!' cried Balin, 'I know thee, Merlin! We would fain be ruled by thy  counsel, old magician.'    So it came about, with Merlin's aid, that Balin and Balan came upon  King Rience that night with but a small band of his knights, and with a  sudden attack out of the dark wood the two brothers seized the king and  slew many of his men that tried to save him. And when they had ridden  some way towards Camelot with the king, wounded and bound, between  them, Merlin vanished from beside them.    Then they rode to Camelot at the dawning, and delivered Rience to the  porter at the gate, to be led to King Arthur when he should sit in  hall, and the two knights rode away. So, by the capture of King Rience,  his host was put to naught, and the king paid his homage to King  Arthur, and swore on the sacred relics of the Abbey of Camelot to be  his true man while he should live.    At that time Balin could not meet with the felon knight, Sir Garlon,  who wrought evil by wizardry, and he and his brother went their  different ways seeking adventure. Sir Balin returned to King Arthur and  became one of his most valiant knights.    It happened on a day that King Arthur journeyed with his knights from  Camelot to London, and he lay in his pavilion in the heat of the day.  As he rested he heard the noise of a horse, and looking out of the flap  of his tent, he saw a strange knight passing, making great complaint  and sorrowing, and with him was a damsel.    'Abide, fair sir,' said Arthur, 'and tell me wherefore you are  troubled.'    'Ye may little amend it,' answered the knight, and passed on.    Later came Sir Balin and saluted the king, who told him of the strange  knight sorrowing as he rode, and the king bade him follow and bring  back the knight to him, 'for,' said he, 'the sorrows of that knight  were so piercing that I would fain know his grief.'    Sir Balin took horse and lance and rode many miles through the forest,  and by evening he came upon the knight and the lady.    'Sir knight,' said Balin, 'ye must come with me unto my lord, King  Arthur, for to tell him the cause of your sorrow.'    'That will I not,' answered the knight, 'for it would do me none  avail.'    'Sir, make ready,' replied Balin, 'for ye must needs go with me, or  else I will fight with you and take you by force.'    'No heart have I to fight, for all joy of life is dead with me,' said  the knight, 'but I am on a fierce quest, and ye must be my warrant if I  go with you that I be not kept from my quest.'    'I will gladly warrant you,' said Balin, and together with the lady  they turned back.    'I fear not to tell you my sorrow,' said the knight as they rode. 'I  but lately returned from fighting the pagans in the north, and when I  came to my father's hall, men told me that the lady that I loved most  tenderly had been robbed away by a villain knight. And as I sorrowed  and went forth to seek the knight to slay him, lo, there I saw my lady,  who had escaped unscathed from his evil hold. And much joy we made of  each other, for we loved each other tenderly. But even as we kissed,  there came an arrow through the air and pierced my dear lady to the  heart, so that she fell dead in my arms. And there was none to see who  shot the arrow, but men said it was the felon knight who had taken my  lady, and he had killed her by black magic. So now with this damsel, my  dear sister, who was her friend, do I go through the world seeking the  invisible knight. And when I find him, with God's help I will surely  slay him.'    The good knight Balin was much moved by the sad story.    'Ah!' said he, 'it is the same fell knight whose death I seek by this  good sword. And we will fare together, you and I, and take his evil  life when God leads us to him.'    Even as Sir Balin spoke, out of a dark glade by their side came a lance  hurtling, as if held in rest by an invisible rider, and while they  turned their heads at the sound of its hissing through the air, it  pierced the side of the sorrowing knight and stood deep in the wound.    'Alas!' cried the knight, falling from his horse, 'I am slain by the  traitorous and wizard knight. His punishment is not for me, sir knight,  but I charge you, seek him out and slay him for my sake, and for the  sake of my dead lady.'    'That will I do,' said Balin, sorrowing, 'and thereof I make a vow to  you and this damsel by my knighthood.'    When Balin had told all to his lord, King Arthur, the king made the  knight to be buried in a rich tomb, and on it engraved his sad story,  together with his name, Sir Herlew, and that of his lady love,  Gwenellen.    Balin and the damsel rode forward the next day and for many days, and  ever the lady bore the truncheon of the spear with her by which Sir  Herlew had been slain.    Then on a day they lodged at the house of a rich knight named Sir  Gwydion, an old grey gentleman, of a sad aspect. When night came, Sir  Balin lay sleeping in the hall beside the fire, and suddenly he awoke  at the sound of one sorrowing quietly near him. He rose up and went to  the pallet and saw it was his host, and he asked him why he mourned in  the dark.    'I will tell you,' said the old sad knight, 'and the telling will  comfort me. I was but late at a jousting, and there I jousted with a  knight that is brother to good King Pellam. And a full evil kinsman is  this knight of so good a king. I smote the evil man from his horse  twice, and he was full of rage that I, an old man, should overcome him.  Therefore by treachery he assailed my son, a young and untried knight,  and slew him. And I cannot avenge my dear son, for the evil man goeth  invisible. But I pray that I may meet him in a little while.'    'Is not his name Garlon?' asked Balin.    'Ye say right,' said Sir Gwydion.    'Ah, I know him,' replied Balin, 'and I had rather meet with him than  have all the gold of this realm.'    'That shall we both do,' said his host. 'For King Pellam, his brother,  king of the land of Holy Hallows, hath made a cry in all this country,  of a great feast that shall be in twenty days, and that evil knight,  your enemy and mine, shall we see there.'    On the morrow they rode all three towards the town of King Pellam, and  when they came within the country of Holy Hallows, Sir Balin saw how  fair and happy was the land and its joyful people. Their meadows were  rich with grass, the cattle were thriving and sleek, the trees were  loaded with fruit and the cornfields full with rich ripe corn.    'Why doth it seem,' asked Balin, 'that this country is the fairest and  happiest that ever I saw?'    'It is for this,' said Sir Gwydion, 'that in the Castle of Holy  Hallows, whither we wend, King Pellam hath some holy relics of a  passing marvellous power, and while he keepeth these his land is rich  and happy, and plagues cannot enter it nor murrain, nor can pestilence  waste the people.'    When they reached the castle they found a great throng of lords and  ladies, and because Sir Gwydion had no lady with him he could not sit  at the feast. But Balin was well received and brought to a chamber, and  they unarmed him. The squires brought him a festal robe to his  pleasure, but he would not suffer them to take his sword.    'Nay,' said he, 'it is my vow that never shall I and my sword be  parted, and that vow will I keep or depart as I came.'    So they suffered him to wear it under his robe, and he was set in the  hall with his lady beside him. Anon, when the meal was ended and the  mead horns were set, Sir Balin asked his neighbour whether there was a  knight at that court named Garlon.    'Yonder he goeth,' said the knight; 'he with that dark face and  piercing eye. He is the most marvellous knight that is now living, and  though King Pellam loveth him dearly, because he is his brother, yet he  suffers bitterly the evil magic of Sir Garlon. For that knight rideth  invisible, and slays so that none may know how they get their death.'    Sir Balin's heart rose at these words, and he trembled with his great  anger.    'Ah, well,' said the good knight. 'And that is he?'    He considered long within himself what he should do.    'If I slay him here in this crowded hall,' he said, 'I shall surely not  escape, and if I leave him now, peradventure I shall never meet with  him again, and much evil will he do if he be let to live.'    He could not remove his eyes from Sir Garlon where he walked between  the tables, proudly talking and laughing with those he knew, and making  soft speeches to ladies, though many showed fear of him, and crossed  their fingers while he spoke to them, to fend off the evil of his eyes.  Very soon Sir Garlon noticed the fixed, stern look of Sir Balin, "]]]
