As the  weeks went by, the shadows and the smell grew more and more  pronounced, and by the arrival of August had become so emphatic that  Lady Adela could not help thinking that they were both hostile and  aggressive.    About eight o'clock on the evening of the second Friday in the month,  Lady Adela was purposely alone in the basement of the house. The  servants especially irritated her; like the majority of present-day  domestics, products of the County Council schools, they were so  intensely supercilious and silly, and Lady Adela felt that their  presence in the house minimised her chances of seeing the ghost. No  apparition with the smallest amount of self-respect could risk coming  in contact with such inane creatures, so she sent them all out for a  motor drive, and, for once, rejoiced in the house to herself. A  curious proceeding for a lady! True! but then, Lady Adela was a lady,  and, being a lady, was not afraid of being thought anything else; and  so acted just as unconventionally as she chose. But stay a moment; she  was not alone in the house, for she had three of her dogs with  her--three beautiful boarhounds, trophies of her last trip to the  Baltic. With such colossal and perfectly trained companions Lady Adela  felt absolutely safe, and ready--as she acknowledged afterwards--to  face a whole army of spooks. She did not even shiver when the front  door of the basement closed, and she heard the sonorous birring of the  motor, drowning the giddy voices of the servants, grow fainter and  fainter until it finally ceased altogether.    When the last echoes of the vehicle had died away in the distance,  Lady Adela made a tour of the premises. The housekeeper's room pleased  her immensely--at least she persuaded herself it did. \"Why, it is  quite as nice as any of the rooms upstairs,\" she said aloud, as she  stood with her face to the failing sunbeams and rested her strong  white hand on the edge of the table. \"Quite as nice. Karl and Max,  come here!\"    But the boarhounds for once in their lives did not obey her with a  good grace. There was something in the room they did not like, and  they showed how strong was their resentment by slinking unwillingly  through the doorway.    \"I wonder why that is?\" Lady Adela mused; \"I have never known them do  it before.\" Then her eyes wandered round the walls, and struggled in  vain to reach the remoter angles of the room, which had suddenly grown  dark. She tried to assure herself that this was but the natural effect  of the departing daylight, and that, had she watched in other houses  at this particular time, she would have noticed the same thing. To  show how little she minded the gloom, she went up to the darkest  corner and prodded the walls with her riding-whip. She laughed--there  was nothing there, nothing whatsoever to be afraid of, only shadows.  With a careless shrug of her shoulders, she strutted into the  passage, and, whistling to Karl and Max who, contrary to their custom,  would not keep to heel, made another inspection of the kitchens. At  the top of the cellar steps she halted. The darkness had now set in  everywhere, and she argued that it would be foolish to venture into  such dungeon-like places without a light. She soon found one, and,  armed with candle and matches, began her descent. There were several  cellars, and they presented such a dismal, dark appearance, that she  instinctively drew her skirts tightly round her, and exchanged the  slender riding-whip for a poker. She whistled again to her dogs. They  did not answer, so she called them both by name angrily. But for some  reason (some quite unaccountable reason, she told herself) they would  not come.    She ransacked her mind to recall some popular operatic air, and  although she knew scores she could not remember one. Indeed, the only  air that filtered back to her was one she detested--a Vaudeville tune  she had heard three nights in succession, when she was staying with a  student friend in the Latin Quarter in Paris. She hummed it loudly,  however, and, holding the lighted candle high above her head, walked  down the steps. At the bottom she stood still and listened. From high  above her came noises which sounded like the rumbling of distant  thunder, but which, on analysis, proved to be the rattling of  window-frames. Reassured that she had no cause for alarm, Lady Adela  advanced. Something black scudded across the red-tiled floor, and she  made a dash at it with her poker. The concussion awoke countless  echoes in the cellars, and called into existence legions of other  black things that darted hither and thither in all directions. She  burst out laughing--they were only beetles! Facing her she now  perceived an inner cellar, which was far gloomier than the one in  which she stood. The ceiling was very low, and appeared to be crushed  down beneath the burden of a stupendous weight; and as she advanced  beneath it she half expected that it would \"cave in\" and bury her.    A few feet from the centre of this cellar she stopped; and, bending  down, examined the floor carefully. The tiles were unmistakably newer  here than elsewhere, and presented the appearance of having been put  in at no very distant date. The dampness of the atmosphere was  intense; a fact which struck Lady Adela as somewhat odd, since the  floor and walls looked singularly dry. To find out if this were the  case, she ran her fingers over the walls, and, on removing them, found  they showed no signs of moisture. Then she rapped the floor and walls,  and could discover no indications of hollowness. She sniffed the air,  and a great wave of something sweet and sickly half choked her. She  drew out her handkerchief and beat the air vigorously with it; but the  smell remained, and she could not in any way account for it. She  turned to leave the cellar, and the flame of her candle burned blue.  Then for the first time that evening--almost, indeed, for the first  time in her life--she felt afraid, so afraid that she made no attempt  to diagnose her fear; she understood the dogs' feelings now, and  caught herself wondering how much they knew.    She whistled to them again, not because she thought they would  respond,--she knew only too well they would not,--but because she  wanted company, even the company of her own voice; and she had some  faint hope, too, that whatever might be with her in the cellar, would  not so readily disclose itself if she made a noise. The one cellar was  passed, and she was nearly across the floor of the other when she  heard a crash. The candle dropped from her hand, and all the blood in  her body rushed to her heart. She could never have imagined it was so  terrible to be frightened. She tried to pull herself together and be  calm, but she was no longer mistress of her limbs. Her knees knocked  together and her hands shook. \"It was only the dogs,\" she feebly told  herself, \"I will call them\"; but when she opened her mouth, she found  her throat was paralysed--not a syllable would come. She knew, too,  that she had lied, and that the hounds could not have been responsible  for the noise. It was like nothing she had ever heard, nothing she  could imagine; and although she struggled hard against the idea, she  could not help associating the sound with the cause of the candle  burning blue, and the sweet, sickly smell. Incapable of moving a  step, she was forced to listen in breathless expectancy for a  recurrence of the crash. Her thoughts become ghastly. The inky sea of  darkness that hemmed her in on every side suggested every sort of  ghoulish possibility, and with each pulsation of her overstrained  heart her flesh crawled. Another sound--this time not a crash, nothing  half so loud or definite--drew her eyes in the direction of the steps.  An object was now standing at the top of them, and something lurid,  like the faint, phosphorescent glow of decay, emanated from all over  it; but _what_ it was, she could not for the life of her tell. It  might have been the figure of a man, or a woman, or a beast, or of  anything that was inexpressibly antagonistic and nasty. She would have  given her soul to have looked elsewhere, but her eyes were fixed--she  could neither turn nor shut them. For some seconds the shape remained  motionless, and then with a sly, subtle motion it lowered its head,  and came stealing stealthily down the stairs towards her. She followed  its approach like one in a hideous dream--her heart ready to burst,  her brain on the verge of madness. Another step, another, yet  another; till there were only three left between her and it; and she  was at length enabled to form some idea of what the thing was like.    It was short and squat, and appeared to be partly clad in a loose,  flowing garment, that was not long enough to conceal the glistening  extremities of its limbs. From its general contour and the tangled  mass of hair that fell about its neck and shoulders, Lady Adela  concluded it was the phantasm of a woman. Its head being kept bent,  she was unable to see the face in full, but every instant she expected  the revelation would take place, and with each separate movement of  the phantasm her suspense became more and more intolerable. At last it  stood on the floor of the cellar, a broad, ungainly, horribly ungainly  figure, that glided up to and past her into the far cellar. There it  halted, as nearly as she could judge on the new tiles, and remained  standing. As she gazed at it, too fascinated to remove her eyes, there  was a loud, reverberating crash, a hideous sound of wrenching and  tearing, and the whole of the ceiling of the inner chamber came down  with an appalling roar.

It was  outrageous that James should have been seen in public at all with  such a person. The man had a broken nose and talked through it.  He was saying in a loud voice that made everybody turn round  something about his left-scissors hook--whatever that may have  been. I discovered later that he was a low professional pugilist  from New York--a man named Spike Dillon, I think Captain Wroxton  said. And Jimmy was giving him lunch--at the _Carlton!_\"    Mr. Crocker said nothing. Constant practice had made him an adept  at saying nothing when his wife was talking.    \"James must be made to realise his responsibilities. I shall have  to speak to him. I was hearing only the other day of a most  deserving man, extremely rich and lavishly generous in his  contributions to the party funds, who was only given a  knighthood, simply because he had a son who had behaved in a  manner that could not possibly be overlooked. The present Court  is extraordinarily strict in its views. James cannot be too  careful. A certain amount of wildness in a young man is quite  proper in the best set, provided that he is wild in the right  company. Every one knows that young Lord Datchet was ejected from  the Empire Music-Hall on Boat-Race night every year during his  residence at Oxford University, but nobody minds. The family  treats it as a joke. But James has such low tastes. Professional  pugilists! I believe that many years ago it was not unfashionable  for young men in Society to be seen about with such persons, but  those days are over. I shall certainly speak to James. He cannot  afford to call attention to himself in any way. That  breach-of-promise case of his three years ago, is, I hope and  trust, forgotten, but the slightest slip on his part might start  the papers talking about it again, and that would be fatal. The  eventual successor to a title must be quite as careful as--\"    It was not, as has been hinted above, the usual practice of Mr.  Crocker to interrupt his wife when she was speaking, but he did  it now.    \"Say!\"    Mrs. Crocker frowned.    \"I wish, Bingley--and I have told you so often--that you would  not begin your sentences with the word 'Say'! It is such a  revolting Americanism. Suppose some day when you are addressing  the House of Lords you should make a slip like that! The papers  would never let you hear the end of it.\"    Mr. Crocker was swallowing convulsively, as if testing his larynx  with a view to speech. Like Saul of Tarsus, he had been stricken  dumb by the sudden bright light which his wife's words had caused  to flash upon him. Frequently during his sojourn in London he had  wondered just why Eugenia had settled there in preference to her  own country. It was not her wont to do things without an object,  yet until this moment he had been unable to fathom her motives.  Even now it seemed almost incredible. And yet what meaning would  her words have other than the monstrous one which had smitten him  as a blackjack?    \"Say--I mean, Eugenia--you don't want--you aren't trying--you  aren't working to--you haven't any idea of trying to get them to  make me a Lord, have you?\"    \"It is what I have been working for all these years!\"    \"But--but why? Why? That's what I want to know. Why?\"    Mrs. Crocker's fine eyes glittered.    \"I will tell you why, Bingley. Just before we were married I had  a talk with my sister Nesta. She was insufferably offensive. She  referred to you in terms which I shall never forgive. She affected  to look down on you, to think that I was marrying beneath me. So  I am going to make you an English peer and send Nesta a newspaper  clipping of the Birthday Honours with your name in it, if I have  to keep working till I die! Now you know!\"    Silence fell. Mr. Crocker drank cold coffee. His wife stared with  gleaming eyes into the glorious future.    \"Do you mean that I shall have to stop on here till they make me  a lord?\" said Mr. Crocker limply.    \"Yes.\"    \"Never go back to America?\"    \"Not till we have succeeded.\"    \"Oh Gee! Oh Gosh! Oh Hell!\" said Mr. Crocker, bursting the bonds  of years.    Mrs. Crocker though resolute, was not unkindly. She made  allowances for her husband's state of mind. She was willing to  permit even American expletives during the sinking-in process of  her great idea, much as a broad-minded cowboy might listen  indulgently to the squealing of a mustang during the branding  process. Docility and obedience would be demanded of him later,  but not till the first agony had abated. She spoke soothingly to  him.    \"I am glad we have had this talk, Bingley. It is best that you  should know. It will help you to realise your responsibilities.  And that brings me back to James. Thank goodness Lord Percy  Whipple is in town. He is about James' age, and from what Lady  Corstorphine tells me will be an ideal friend for him. You  understand who he is, of course? The second son of the Duke of  Devizes, the Premier's closest friend, the man who can  practically dictate the Birthday Honours. If James and Lord Percy  can only form a close friendship, our battle will be as good as  won. It will mean everything. Lady Corstorphine has promised to  arrange a meeting. In the meantime, I will speak to James and  warn him to be more careful.\"    Mr. Crocker had produced a stump of pencil from his pocket and  was writing on the table-cloth.        Lord Crocker      Lord Bingley Crocker      Lord Crocker of Crocker      The Marquis of Crocker      Baron Crocker      Bingley, first Viscount Crocker    He blanched as he read the frightful words. A sudden thought stung  him.    \"Eugenia!\"    \"Well?\"    \"What will the boys at the Lambs say?\"    \"I am not interested,\" replied his wife, \"in the boys at the  Lambs.\"    \"I thought you wouldn't be,\" said the future baron gloomily.        CHAPTER III    FAMILY JARS    It is a peculiarity of the human mind that, with whatever  apprehension it may be regarding the distant future, it must  return after a while to face the minor troubles of the future  that is immediate. The prospect of a visit to the dentist this  afternoon causes us to forget for the moment the prospect of  total ruin next year. Mr. Crocker, therefore, having tortured  himself for about a quarter of an hour with his meditations on  the subject of titles, was jerked back to a more imminent  calamity than the appearance of his name in the Birthday  Honours--the fact that in all probability he would be taken again  this morning to watch the continuation of that infernal  cricket-match, and would be compelled to spend the greater part  of to-day, as he had spent the greater part of yesterday, bored  to the verge of dissolution in the pavilion at Lord's.    One gleam of hope alone presented itself. Like baseball, this  pastime of cricket was apparently affected by rain, if there had  been enough of it. He had an idea that there had been a good deal  of rain in the night, but had there been sufficient to cause the  teams of Surrey and Kent to postpone the second instalment of  their serial struggle? He rose from the table and went out into  the hall. It was his purpose to sally out into Grosvenor Square  and examine the turf in its centre with the heel of his shoe, in  order to determine the stickiness or non-stickiness of the  wicket. He moved towards the front door, hoping for the best, and  just as he reached it the bell rang.    One of the bad habits of which his wife had cured Mr. Crocker in  the course of the years was the habit of going and answering  doors. He had been brought up in surroundings where every man was  his own door-keeper, and it had been among his hardest tasks to  learn the lesson that the perfect gentleman does not open doors  but waits for the appropriate menial to come along and do it for  him. He had succeeded at length in mastering this great truth,  and nowadays seldom offended. But this morning his mind was  clouded by his troubles, and instinct, allaying itself with  opportunity, was too much for him. His fingers had been on the  handle when the ring came, so he turned it.    At the top of the steps which connect the main entrance of  Drexdale House with the sidewalk three persons were standing. One  was a tall and formidably handsome woman in the early forties  whose appearance seemed somehow oddly familiar. The second was a  small, fat, blobby, bulging boy who was chewing something. The  third, lurking diffidently in the rear, was a little man of about  Mr. Crocker's own age, grey-haired and thin with brown eyes that  gazed meekly through rimless glasses.    Nobody could have been less obtrusive than this person, yet it was  he who gripped Mr. Crocker's attention and caused that home-sick  sufferer's heart to give an almost painful leap. For he was  clothed in one of those roomy suits with square shoulders which  to the seeing eye are as republican as the Stars and Stripes. His  blunt-toed yellow shoes sang gaily of home. And his hat was not  so much a hat as an effusive greeting from Gotham. A long time  had passed since Mr. Crocker had set eyes upon a biped so  exhilaratingly American, and rapture held him speechless, as one  who after long exile beholds some landmark of his childhood.    The female member of the party took advantage of his  dumbness--which, as she had not unnaturally mistaken him for the  butler, she took for a silent and respectful query as to her  business and wishes--to open the conversation.    \"Is Mrs. Crocker at home? Please tell her that Mrs. Pett wishes  to see her.\"    There was a rush and scurry in the corridors of Mr. Crocker's  brain, as about six different thoughts tried to squash  simultaneously into that main chamber where there is room for  only one at a time. He understood now why this woman's appearance  had seemed familiar. She was his wife's sister, and that same  Nesta who was some day to be pulverised by the sight of his name  in the Birthday Honours."]]]
