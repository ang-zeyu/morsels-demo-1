It follows that the statues of the gods dating from this early period,  however interesting they might be for the history of sculpture, would  not, even if we possessed many more of them than we do possess, throw  very much light upon the development of the ideas of the Greeks  concerning their deities. They would probably conform to a limited  number of clearly defined types. The most familiar of all, the standing  nude male figure, would, if beardless, usually represent Apollo, with a  bow or a branch of bay, or sometimes other attributes. A similar type,  bearded, would stand for Zeus or Posidon or Hermes, if provided with  thunderbolt or eagle, with trident or fish, or with a caduceus. Similar  figures might also be draped, and still represent gods; or, if female,  would serve for Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite, and sometimes for Athena, if  she was represented without her arms and aegis. Then, too, there was the  seated type, usually enveloped in full drapery, which might readily be  adapted to a statue of any of the chief gods. In all of these there is  no question of distinguishing the gods from one another in character and  individuality; apart from attributes, there is hardly any attempt to  distinguish gods from men.    Perhaps the earliest class of statues in which we find any attempt to  give artistic expression to superhuman power is that in which we see the  god in vigorous action, often striking with his characteristic weapon:  Zeus with his thunderbolt in his raised right hand, Posidon with his  trident, or Athena advancing rapidly with brandished spear and shield  advanced. But even these figures, apart from their divine attributes,  show no essential distinction from human combatants. It is a significant  fact that it is still a matter of dispute[6] whether one of the most  famous statues of the early fifth century, \"the Choiseul-Gouffier  Apollo,\" represents a god or an athlete. This is neither because the  Greeks at this time idealised their athletes nor because they humanised  their gods, but because they typified them both; that is to say, they  represented them by a type which was the most perfect rendering within  their power either of man or of an anthropomorphic deity. Here we have  the material form provided by means of which the ideals of the  succeeding period were to find their artistic expression--such a typical  or normal human form is, in fact, the logical expression of  anthropomorphism in its most literal sense--the making of gods after  man's image. But those who believed rather that man was made after God's  image would look to find in the prototype something more and higher than  can be seen in its earthly copy. This notion, even if not formulated by  philosophy until a later age, certainly underlies the idealistic art of  the fifth century.    [Footnote 6: Even if this dispute be regarded as now settled by weight  of evidence, the fact that such a dispute is possible retains its  significance.]          CHAPTER V    IDEALISM      The age which followed the great Persian Wars was the time of the  highest political, literary, and intellectual development in Greece. Nor  was it unfavourable to strength and depth of religious feeling among the  people. If the more thoughtful among them were inclined to doubt whether  some of the stories told about the gods were either probable or  edifying, these were the very men who, on the other hand, were most  capable of appreciating the higher and nobler conceptions of the gods  which we find in contemporary poets. And the great delivery from the  Persians not only gave the Greeks a confidence in themselves which  justly increased their national pride and thereby strengthened their  national ideals, but it also gave occasion to a confidence in the gods  and a gratitude to them which found expression in numerous buildings and  offerings. All this religious activity could not fail to have  considerable influence upon the common people; and in some cases, as at  Athens, there was the necessity of replacing the temples and statues  that had been destroyed or carried off by the Persian invader. At the  time when a demand occurred for new statues of the gods, the rapid  progress of the art of sculpture made it inevitable that these new  statues should not be mere reproductions or reminiscences of the ones  they replaced, but fresh and original conceptions, worthy of the  increased skill of the artist and of the nobler ideals of the people.  And by one of those coincidences which we meet so often both in the  history of art and in that of literature, just at the time when the  material conditions, the spirit of the people, and the rapid advance of  art gave the utmost scope for artistic creation, there arose the man of  transcendent genius to give full expression to the religious and  artistic aspirations of the time. The age of Pericles was also the age  of Phidias. It is true that there was an interval between the defeat of  the Persians and the period of highest attainment in Greece; and during  this interval many temples were built or rebuilt, and many statues were  set up as objects of worship or as dedications to the gods. Some of  these may have anticipated to a certain extent the work of Phidias;  several of them were of colossal size, like his chief masterpieces, and  thus, even from the technical point of view, may have prepared the way  before him; one, the Apollo by Calamis at Apollonia, was about  forty-five feet high, and so actually rivalled the Zeus and Athena of  Phidias in size. But of these statues we know little or nothing. As to  the two most famous works of Phidias himself, the Athena Parthenos  within the Parthenon at Athens and the Zeus at Olympia, we are better  informed, so far as elaborate descriptions and the somewhat rhetorical  appreciations of later writers are concerned; and we possess some extant  copies which tell us something of their pose and attributes. But any  notion we may form as to their true artistic and religious character  must be mainly dependent upon our imagination; and even for their  relation to the religious ideals of the people we are dependent for the  most part upon indirect evidence. Though the art of sculpture was so  closely bound up with the life of the people in Greece, we find very few  references to its greatest works; it is evident that the Athenians, for  example, took the greatest pride in the buildings that adorned their  Acropolis and in the sculptures they contained; yet when Pericles, as  reported by Thucydides, speaks of the statue of the Athena Parthenos, it  is only to reckon the gold of her drapery as part of the possible  resources of the state. We know that in the eyes of Pericles and of his  hearers the preciousness of the material was only an incident in the  artistic character of the work; but what is felt most deeply is often  the least spoken about. Later descriptions, such as that of Pausanias,  lay emphasis on the details and accessories of the statue, the  ornamentation of helmet and shield and sandals; they lay themselves open  to the stricture of Lucian on \"such as can neither see nor praise the  whole beauty of the Olympian Zeus, great and noble as it is, nor  describe it to others that do not know it, but admire the accurate work  and fine polish of his footstool and the good proportions of the basis,  enumerating all such details with the utmost care.\" At the same time  even such information as they give us is welcome, since it aids our  imagination to reconstruct the appearance of the whole. These great  chryselephantine statues were placed within the cella of a temple,  lighted only through the door and by some infiltration through the  marble roof, and their effect was calculated for these conditions. The  rich tone and subtle reflections of the ivory and the gold, mingled with  coloured inlays of enamel or precious stones, and tempered and  harmonised by a \"dim religious light,\" must have been most impressive;  and the grandeur of the figures was enhanced by their colossal size. But  in all this we are still dealing only with conditions and accessories,  not with the art itself and the religious ideals which it expressed.  These are perhaps easier for us to appreciate in the case of the Zeus  than of the Athena, though we are better provided with copies of the  latter. We are accustomed in our own religious art to the attempt to  express divinity in the form of a mature man of unspeakable majesty and  benignity. To the Greeks, indeed, the human figure of Zeus was not  merely an incarnation, but the actual form of the god himself; the god  was not thought of as having taken upon himself the sorrows and the  weaknesses of our mortal nature, but as sharing only its ideal  perfection. Yet that the effect was not altogether dissimilar is shown  by such a passage as that we find in Dion Chrysostom: \"A man whose soul  is utterly immersed in toil, who has suffered many disasters and  sorrows, and cannot even enjoy sweet sleep, even such an one, I think,  if he stood face to face with this statue, would forget all the dangers  and difficulties of this mortal life: such the vision you, Phidias, have  invented and devised, a sight 'to lull all pain and anger, and bring  forgetfulness of every sorrow.'\"    The same writer elsewhere puts into the mouth of Phidias an explanation  of how he had attempted to embody in his statue the current conception  of the god, and even the epithets that belonged to his worship. \"My  Zeus,\" says the sculptor, \"is peaceful and altogether gentle, as the  guardian of a Hellas free from factions and of one mind with itself.  Him, taking counsel with my art, and with the wise and noble Elean  state, I set up in his temple, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#8)"],[1,"well and drinking well, in a newly furnished house, having to keep a  servant and maintain our position in life, with expenses mounting and  not a penny coming in. It's absurd. We've got hundreds of hens (most  of them cocks, it's true, but I forgot they didn't lay), and getting  not even enough eggs for our own table. We must make some more  arrangements. Come on in and let us think the thing out.\"    But this speech was the outcome of a rare moment of pessimism. In his  brighter moods he continued to express unbounded faith in the hens,  and was willing to leave the thing to time.    Meanwhile, we were creating quite a small sensation in the  neighborhood. The interest of the natives was aroused at first by the  fact that nearly all of them received informal visits from our fowls,  which had strayed. Small boys would arrive in platoons, each bearing  his quota of stragglers. \"Be these your 'ens, zur?\" was the formula.  \"If they be, we've got twenty-fower mower in our yard. Could 'ee coom  over and fetch 'em?\"    However, after the hired retainer and I had completed our work with  the wire netting, desertions became less frequent. People poured in  from villages for miles around to look at the up-to-date chicken farm.  It was a pleasing and instructive spectacle to see Ukridge, in a pink  shirt without a collar, and very dirty flannel trousers, lecturing to  the intelligent natives on the breeding of fowls. They used to go away  with the dazed air of men who have heard strange matters, and Ukridge,  unexhausted, would turn to interview the next batch. I fancy we gave  Lyme Regis something to think about. Ukridge must have been in the  nature of a staggerer to the rustic mind.    It was now, as I have said, Thursday, the twenty-second of July, a  memorable date to me. A glorious, sunny morning, of the kind which  Nature provides occasionally, in an ebullition of benevolence. It is  at times such as this that we dream our dreams and compose our  masterpieces.    And a masterpiece I was, indeed, making. The new novel was growing  nobly. Striking scenes and freshets of scintillating dialogue rushed  through my mind. I had neglected my writing for the past week in favor  of the tending of fowls, but I was making up for lost time now.  Another uninterrupted quarter of an hour, and I firmly believe I  should have completed the framework of a novel that would have placed  me with the great, in that select band whose members have no Christian  names. Another quarter of an hour and posterity would have known me as  \"Garnet.\"    But it was not to be. I had just framed the most poignant, searching  conversation between my heroine and my hero, and was about to proceed,  flushed with great thoughts, to further triumphs, when a distant shout  brought me to earth.    \"Stop her! Catch her! Garnet!\"    I was in the paddock at the time. Coming toward me at her best pace  was a small hen. Behind the hen was Bob, doing, as usual, the thing  that he ought not to have done. Behind Bob--some way behind--was  Ukridge. It was his shout that I had heard.    \"After her, Garny, old horse!\" he repeated. \"A valuable bird. Must not  be lost.\"    When not in a catalepsy of literary composition, I am essentially the  man of action. I laid aside my novel for future reference, and, after  a fruitless lunge at the hen as it passed, joined Bob in the chase.    We passed out of the paddock in the following order: First, the hen,  as fresh as paint, and good for a five-mile spin; next, Bob, panting  but fit for anything; lastly, myself, determined, but mistrustful of  my powers of pedestrianism. In the distance Ukridge gesticulated and  shouted advice.    After the first field Bob gave up the chase, and sauntered off to  scratch at a rabbit hole. He seemed to think that he had done all that  could be expected of him in setting the thing going. His air suggested  that he knew the affair was in competent hands, and relied on me to do  the right thing.    The exertions of the past few days had left me in very fair condition,  but I could not help feeling that in competition with the hen I was  overmatched. Neither in speed nor in staying power was I its equal.  But I pounded along doggedly. Whenever I find myself fairly started on  any business I am reluctant to give it up. I began to set an  extravagant value on the capture of the small hen. All the abstract  desire for fame which had filled my mind five minutes before was  concentrated now on that one feat. In a calmer moment I might have  realized that one bird more or less would not make a great deal of  difference to the fortunes of the chicken farm, but now my power of  logical reasoning had left me. All our fortunes seemed to me to center  in the hen, now half a field in front of me.    We had been traveling downhill all this time, but at this point we  crossed the road and the ground began to rise. I was in that painful  condition which occurs when one has lost one's first wind and has not  yet got one's second. I was hotter than I had ever been in my life.    Whether the hen, too, was beginning to feel the effects of its run I  do not know, but it slowed down to a walk, and even began to peck in a  tentative manner at the grass. This assumption on its part that the  chase was at an end irritated me. I felt that I should not be worthy  of the name of Englishman if I allowed myself to be treated as a  cipher by a mere bird. It should realize yet that it was no light  matter to be pursued by J. Garnet, author of \"The Maneuvers of  Arthur,\" etc.    A judicious increase of pace brought me within a yard or two of my  quarry. But it darted from me with a startled exclamation and moved  off rapidly up the hill. I followed, distressed. The pace was proving  too much for me. The sun blazed down. It seemed to concentrate its  rays on my back, to the exclusion of the surrounding scenery, in much  the same way as the moon behaves to the heroine of a melodrama. A  student of the drama has put it on record that he has seen the moon  follow the heroine round the stage, and go off with her (left). The  sun was just as attentive to me.    We were on level ground now. The hen had again slowed to a walk, and I  was capable of no better pace. Very gradually I closed in on it. There  was a high boxwood hedge in front of us. Just as I came close enough  to stake my all on a single grab, the hen dived into this and  struggled through in the mysterious way in which birds do get through  hedges.    I was in the middle of the obstacle, very hot, tired, and dirty, when  from the other side I heard a sudden shout of \"Mark over! Bird to the  right!\" and the next moment I found myself emerging, with a black face  and tottering knees, on to the gravel path of a private garden.    Beyond the path was a croquet lawn, on which I perceived, as through a  glass darkly, three figures. The mist cleared from my eyes and I  recognized two of the trio.    One was my Irish fellow-traveler, the other was his daughter.    The third member of the party was a man, a stranger to me. By some  miracle of adroitness he had captured the hen, and was holding it,  protesting, in a workman-like manner behind the wings.          THE ENTENTE CORDIALE    VII      It has been well observed that there are moments and moments. The  present, as far as I was concerned, belonged to the more painful  variety.    Even to my exhausted mind it was plain that there was need here for  explanations. An Irishman's croquet lawn is his castle, and strangers  cannot plunge on to it unannounced through hedges without being  prepared to give reasons.    Unfortunately, speech was beyond me. I could have done many things at  that moment. I could have emptied a water butt, lain down and gone to  sleep, or melted ice with a touch of the finger. But I could not  speak. The conversation was opened by the other man, in whose  soothing hand the hen now lay, apparently resigned to its fate.    \"Come right in,\" he said pleasantly. \"Don't knock. Your bird, I  think?\"    I stood there panting. I must have presented a quaint appearance. My  hair was full of twigs and other foreign substances. My face was moist  and grimy. My mouth hung open. I wanted to sit down. My legs felt as  if they had ceased to belong to me.    \"I must apologize--\" I began, and ended the sentence with gasps.    Conversation languished. The elderly gentleman looked at me with what  seemed to me indignant surprise. His daughter looked through me. The  man regarded me with a friendly smile, as if I were some old crony  dropped in unexpectedly.    \"I'm afraid--\" I said, and stopped again.    \"Hard work, big-game hunting in this weather,\" said the man. \"Take a  long breath.\"    I took several and felt better.    \"I must apologize for this intrusion,\" I said successfully.  \"Unwarrantable\" would have rounded off the sentence nicely, but  instinct told me not to risk it. It would have been mere bravado to  have attempted unnecessary words of five syllables at that juncture.    I paused.    \"Say on,\" said the man with the hen encouragingly, \"I'm a human being  just like yourself.\"    \"The fact is,\" I said, \"I didn't--didn't know there was a private  garden beyond the hedge. If you will give me my hen--\"    \"It's hard to say good-by,\" said the man, stroking the bird's head  with the first finger of his disengaged hand. \"She and I are just  beginning to know and appreciate each other. However, if it must be--\"    He extended the hand which held the bird, and at this point a hitch  occurred. He did his part of the business--the letting go. It was in  my department--the taking hold--that the thing was bungled. The hen  slipped from my grasp like an eel, stood for a moment overcome by the  surprise of being at liberty once more, then fled and intrenched  itself in some bushes at the farther end of the lawn.    There are times when the most resolute man feels that he can battle no  longer with fate; when"]]]
