There are other beautiful  grottoes in the cliffs surrounding the island, the most remarkable being  the natural tunnel called the Green Grotto (Grotta Verde), under the  southern rocks, quite as splendid in color as the Grotta Azzurra  itself--a passage through the rocks, into which the boat glides (through  no hole, as in the case of the Grotta Azzurra) into water of the most  exquisite emerald. The late afternoon is the best time for visiting this  grotto. Occasionally a small steamer makes the round of the island,  stopping at the different caverns.    On landing at the Marina, a number of donkey women offer their services,  and it will be well to accept them, for the ascent of about one mile, to  the village of Capri is very hot and tiring. On the left we pass the  Church of St. Costanzo, a very curious building with apse, cupola, stone  pulpit, and several ancient marble pillars and other fragments taken  from the palaces of Tiberius.    The little town of Capri, overhung on one side by great purple rocks,  occupies a terrace on the high ridge between the two rocky promontories  of the island. Close above the piazza stands the many-domed ancient  church, like a mosque, and so many of the houses--sometimes of dazzling  whiteness, sometimes painted in gay colors--have their own little domes,  that the appearance is quite that of an oriental village, which is  enhanced by the palm-trees which flourish here and there. In the piazza  is a tablet to Major Hamill, who is buried in the church. He fell under  French bayonets, when the troops of Murat, landing at Orico, recaptured  the island, which had been taken from the French two years and a half  before (May, 1806) by Sir Sidney Smith.    Through a low wide arch in the piazza is the approach to the principal  hotels. There is a tiny English chapel. An ascent of half an hour by  stony donkey-paths leads from Capri to the ruins called the Villa  Tiberiana, on the west of the island, above a precipitous rock 700 feet  high, which still bears the name of Il Salto....    The visitor who lingers in Capri may interest himself in tracing out the  remains of all the twelve villas of Tiberius. A relief exhibiting  Tiberius riding a led donkey, as modern travelers do now, was found on  the island, and is now in the museum at Naples. Capri has a delightful  winter climate, and is most comfortable as a residence. The natives are  quite unlike the Neapolitans, pleasant and civil in their manners, and  full of courtesies to strangers. The women are frequently beautiful.          POMPEII[14]    BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY      We have been to see Pompeii, and are waiting now for the return of  spring weather, to visit, first, Paestum, and then the islands; after  which we shall return to Rome. I was astonished at the remains of this  city; I had no conception of anything so perfect yet remaining. My idea  of the mode of its destruction was this: First, an earthquake shattered  it, and unroofed almost all its temples, and split its columns; then a  rain of light small pumice-stones fell; then torrents of boiling water,  mixed with ashes, filled up all its crevices. A wide, flat hill, from  which the city was excavated, is now covered by thick woods, and you see  the tombs and the theaters, the temples and the houses, surrounded by  the uninhabited wilderness.    We entered the town from the side toward the sea, and first saw two  theaters; one more magnificent than the other, strewn with the ruins of  the white marble which formed their seats and cornices, wrought with  deep, bold sculpture. In the front, between the stage and the seats, is  the circular space, occasionally occupied by the chorus. The stage is  very narrow, but long, and divided from this space by a narrow enclosure  parallel to it, I suppose for the orchestra. On each side are the  consuls' boxes, and below, in the theater at Herculaneum, were found two  equestrian statues of admirable workmanship, occupying the same place  as the great bronze lamps did at Drury Lane. The smallest of the  theaters is said to have been comic, tho I should doubt. From both you  see, as you sit on the seats, a prospect of the most wonderful beauty.    You then pass through the ancient streets; they are very narrow, and the  houses rather small, but all constructed on an admirable plan,  especially for this climate. The rooms are built round a court, or  sometimes two, according to the extent of the house. In the midst is a  fountain, sometimes surrounded with a portico, supported on fluted  columns of white stucco; the floor is paved with mosaic, sometimes  wrought in imitation of vine leaves, sometimes in quaint figures, and  more or less beautiful, according to the rank of the inhabitant. There  were paintings on all, but most of them have been removed to decorate  the royal museums. Little winged figures, and small ornaments of  exquisite elegance, yet remain. There is an ideal life in the forms of  these paintings of an incomparable loveliness, tho most are evidently  the work of very inferior artists. It seems as if, from the atmosphere  of mental beauty which surrounded them, every human being caught a  splendor not his own.    In one house you see how the bed-rooms were managed; a small sofa was  built up, where the cushions were placed; two pictures, one representing  Diana and Endymion, the other Venus and Mars, decorate the chamber; and  a little niche, which contains the statue of a domestic god. The floor  is composed of a rich mosaic of the rarest marbles, agate, jasper, and  porphyry; it looks to the marble fountain and the snow-white columns,  whose entablatures strew the floor of the portico they supported. The  houses have only one story, and the apartments, tho not large, are very  lofty. A great advantage results from this, wholly unknown in our  cities.    The public buildings, whose ruins are now forests, as it were, of white  fluted columns, and which then supported entablatures, loaded with  sculptures, were seen on all sides over the roofs of the houses. This  was the excellence of the ancients. Their private expenses were  comparatively moderate; the dwelling of one of the chief senators of  Pompeii is elegant indeed, and adorned with most beautiful specimens of  art, but small. But their public buildings are everywhere marked by the  bold and grand designs of an unsparing magnificence. In the little town  of Pompeii (it contained about twenty thousand inhabitants), it is  wonderful to see the number and the grandeur of their public buildings.  Another advantage, too, is that, in the present case, the glorious  scenery around is not shut out, and that, unlike the inhabitants of the  Cimmerian ravines of modern cities, the ancient Pompeiians could  contemplate the clouds and the lamps of heaven; could see the moon rise  high behind Vesuvius, and the sun set in the sea, tremulous with an  atmosphere of golden vapor, between Inarime and Misenum.    We next saw the temples. Of the temples of Aesculapius little remains  but an altar of black stone, adorned with a cornice imitating the scales  of a serpent. His statue, in terra-cotta, was found in the cell. The  temple of Isis is more perfect. It is surrounded by a portico of fluted  columns, and in the area around it are two altars, and many ceppi for  statues; and a little chapel of white stucco, as hard as stone, of the  most exquisite proportion; its panels are adorned with figures in  bas-relief, slightly indicated, but of a workmanship the most delicate  and perfect that can be conceived.    They are Egyptian subjects, executed by a Greek artist, who has  harmonized all the unnatural extravagances of the original conception  into the supernatural loveliness of his country's genius. They scarcely  touch the ground with their feet, and their wind-uplifted robes seem in  the place of wings. The temple in the midst raised on a high platform,  and approached by steps, was decorated with exquisite paintings, some of  which we saw in the museum at Portici. It is small, of the same  materials as the chapel, with a pavement of mosaic, and fluted Ionic  columns of white stucco, so white that it dazzles you to look at it.    Thence through the other porticos and labyrinths of walls and columns  (for I can not hope to detail everything to you), we came to the Forum.  This is a large square, surrounded by lofty porticos of fluted columns,  some broken, some entire, their entablatures strewed under them. The  temple of Jupiter, of Venus, and another temple, the Tribunal, and the  Hall of Public Justice, with their forest of lofty columns, surround the  Forum. Two pedestals or altars of an enormous size (for, whether they  supported equestrian statues, or were the altars of the temple of Venus,  before which they stand, the guide could not tell), occupy the lower end  of the Forum. At the upper end, supported on an elevated platform,  stands the temple of Jupiter. Under the colonnade of its portico we sat  and pulled out our oranges, and figs, and bread, and medlars (sorry  fare, you will say), and rested to eat.    Here was a magnificent spectacle. Above and between the multitudinous  shafts of the sun-shining columns was seen the sea, reflecting the  purple heaven of noon above it, and supporting, as it were, on its line  the dark lofty mountains of Sorrento, of a blue inexpressibly deep, and  tinged toward their summits with streaks of new-fallen snow. Between was  one small green island. To the right was Capreae, Inarime, Prochyta, and  Misenum. Behind was the single summit of Vesuvius, rolling forth volumes  of thick white smoke, whose foam-like column was sometimes darted into  the clear dark sky, and fell in little streaks along the wind."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#8)"],[1,"there; and they would put it under the  altar and not touch it until they were really in want. So this was done,  and the little pot placed in safety.    But before long the cat was seized with a great wish to taste it.    \"Listen to me, little mouse,\" said he; \"I have been asked by my cousin  to stand god-father to a little son she has brought into the world; he  is white with brown spots; and they want to have the christening to-day,  so let me go to it, and you stay at home and keep house.\"    \"Oh yes, certainly,\" answered the mouse, \"pray go by all means; and when  you are feasting on all the good things, think of me; I should so like a  drop of the sweet red wine.\"    But there was not a word of truth in all this; the cat had no cousin,  and had not been asked to stand god-father: he went to the church,  straight up to the little pot, and licked the fat off the top; then he  took a walk over the roofs of the town, saw his acquaintances, stretched  himself in the sun, and licked his whiskers as often as he thought of  the little pot of fat; and then when it was evening he went home.    \"Here you are at last,\" said the mouse; \"I expect you have had a merry  time.\"    \"Oh, pretty well,\" answered the cat.    \"And what name did you give the child?\" asked the mouse.    \"Top-off,\" answered the cat, drily.    \"Top-off!\" cried the mouse, \"that is a singular and wonderful name! is  it common in your family?\"    \"What does it matter?\" said the cat; \"it's not any worse than  Crumb-picker, like your god-child.\"    A little time after this the cat was again seized with a longing.    \"Again I must ask you,\" said he to the mouse, \"to do me a favour, and  keep house alone for a day. I have been asked a second time to stand  god-father; and as the little one has a white ring round its neck, I  cannot well refuse.\"    So the kind little mouse consented, and the cat crept along by the town  wall until he reached the church, and going straight to the little pot  of fat, devoured half of it.    \"Nothing tastes so well as what one keeps to oneself,\" said he, feeling  quite content with his day's work. When he reached home, the mouse asked  what name had been given to the child.    \"Half-gone,\" answered the cat.    \"Half-gone!\" cried the mouse, \"I never heard such a name in my life!  I'll bet it's not to be found in the calendar.\"    Soon after that the cat's mouth began to water again for the fat.    \"Good things always come in threes,\" said he to the mouse; \"again I have  been asked to stand god-father, the little one is quite black with white  feet, and not any white hair on its body; such a thing does not happen  every day, so you will let me go, won't you?\"    \"Top-off, Half-gone,\" murmured the mouse, \"they are such curious names,  I cannot but wonder at them!\"    \"That's because you are always sitting at home,\" said the cat, \"in your  little grey frock and hairy tail, never seeing the world, and fancying  all sorts of things.\"    So the little mouse cleaned up the house and set it all in order.  Meanwhile the greedy cat went and made an end of the little pot of fat.    \"Now all is finished one's mind will be easy,\" said he, and came home in  the evening, quite sleek and comfortable. The mouse asked at once what  name had been given to the third child.    \"It won't please you any better than the others,\" answered the cat. \"It  is called All-gone.\"    \"All-gone!\" cried the mouse. \"What an unheard-of-name! I never met with  anything like it! All-gone! whatever can it mean?\" And shaking her head,  she curled herself round and went to sleep. After that the cat was not  again asked to stand god-father.    When the winter had come and there was nothing more to be had out of  doors, the mouse began to think of their store.    \"Come, cat,\" said she, \"we will fetch our pot of fat, how good it will  taste, to be sure!\"    \"Of course it will,\" said the cat, \"just as good as if you stuck your  tongue out of window!\"    So they set out, and when they reached the place, they found the pot,  but it was standing empty.    \"Oh, now I know what it all meant,\" cried the mouse, \"now I see what  sort of a partner you have been! Instead of standing god-father you have  devoured it all up; first Top-off, then Half-gone, then\"----    \"Will you hold your tongue!\" screamed the cat, \"another word, and I  devour you too!\"    And the poor little mouse, having \"All-gone\" on her tongue, out it came,  and the cat leaped upon her and made an end of her. And that is the way  of the world.          The WOLF and the SEVEN LITTLE GOATS.      THERE was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of  them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the  wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her.    \"Dear children,\" said she, \"I am going out into the wood; and while I am  gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get  inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often  disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and  black paws.\"    \"Dear mother,\" answered the kids, \"you need not be afraid, we will take  good care of ourselves.\" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on  her way with an easy mind.    It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and  crying out,    \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has  brought each of you something.\"    But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice.    \"We will not open the door,\" cried they; \"you are not our mother, she  has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be  the wolf.\"    Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate  it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the  house-door, and cried,    \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought  each of you something.\"    But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids  seeing this, cried out,    \"We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you  must be the wolf.\"    The wolf then ran to a baker.    \"Baker,\" said he, \"I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over  the place.\"    And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller.    \"Miller,\" said he, \"strew me some white meal over my paws.\" But the  miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one.    \"If you don't do it,\" cried the wolf, \"I'll eat you up!\"    And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows  what men are.    And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. \"Open,  children!\" cried he. \"Your dear mother has come home, and brought you  each something from the wood.\"    \"First show us your paws,\" said the kids, \"so that we may know if you  are really our mother or not.\"    And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they  were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door; and when he was  inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to  hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed,  the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the  cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But  the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other  he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case.  And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the  green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep.    Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a  sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and  stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the  bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called  to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name  of the youngest.    \"Here I am, mother,\" a little voice cried, \"here, in the clock-case.\"    And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten  all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear  children. At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the  youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they  saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook.  The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how  something inside his body was moving and struggling.    \"Dear me!\" thought she, \"can it be that my poor children that he  devoured for his evening meal are still alive?\" And she sent the little  kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then  she cut the wolf's body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than  out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then  one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well,  for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How  delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped  about like tailors at a wedding.    \"Now fetch some good hard stones,\" said the mother, \"and we will fill  his body with them, as he lies asleep.\"    And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the  mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser.    When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him  feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they  struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:        \"What is this I feel inside me      Knocking hard against my bones?      How should such a thing betide me!      They were kids, and now they're stones.\"    So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones  weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And  when the seven little kids saw it they came up running.    \"The wolf is dead,"]]]
