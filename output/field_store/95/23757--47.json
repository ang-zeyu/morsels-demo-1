And how cleverly they are folded up, like  little fans.    Who would imagine such delicate gauzy wings were folded away under the  hard, stiff roof wings.    The roof wings are called wing covers, because they cover up these  pretty inner wings.    The locust does not fly with the wing covers.    It spreads them out wide to get them out of the way.    It flies with the inner wings.    [Illustration]    How pretty the flying wings are when they are spread out!    See, over there goes a grasshopper whose flying wings are bright yellow.    And there goes another with red flying wings.    Some of the grasshoppers are almost as pretty as butterflies when they  are flying.    They show their gay inner wings only during flight.    As soon as the grasshopper comes to rest the inner wings close of  themselves.    The wing joints act like springs.    The grasshopper does not have to think about shutting up its wings.    [Illustration]    John says it has a spring in its wing covers too.    Open the wing cover.    There, it locks itself, as it were, and stays open without any effort on  the part of the grasshopper.    You see the grasshopper wants its wing covers to stay open and out of  the way of the inner wings when it flies.    So it just opens them, and there they are.    It moves the inner wings very fast indeed when it is flying. It would  not do at all for them to be fastened open.    If it did not move them, it could not fly. The wings fairly _whirr_,  they go so fast. They beat against the air, and thus the grasshopper is  pushed along through the air.    As soon as it is done flying it stops moving the wings, and they  instantly close of themselves.    [Illustration]    Then it unlocks the wing covers and they shut down over the inner wings.  They shut down very tightly. They overlap, as you can see, just below  where they are fastened to the insect's body. Thus they form a very good  roof.    [Illustration]    What wonderful wings the grasshopper has!    And there is something more to be said about them.    Some species of locusts use their wings as musical instruments. When  they wish to, they rub the upper end of the inner wings against the  upper end of the wing covers when they are flying.    This makes the crackling sound we sometimes hear when the locusts fly.    What is that, Mollie? You have caught a locust that has no wings at all?    Who can guess why?    Ah, yes, our wise John says he thinks it is because it is a young one.    What makes you think so, John?    I know, you remembered the larva of the dragon fly and of the May fly.    [Illustration]    Those larvae had no wings at first, but the wings grew, and finally at  the last moult they were full-sized.    When first hatched, the locust larva is like the full-grown locust,  only, of course, it is very small, and it has no wings at all.    It is a little dot of a thing with an enormous head.    Here are three clinging to a blade of grass.    Are they not funny little rascals!    The baby locust eats and grows and moults until, finally, the wings  begin to show as little pads at its sides.    [Illustration]    It is easy to find these half-grown grasshoppers in the middle of the  summer.    Here is one that little Nell has caught.    See its wing pads.    Mollie says they are rudimentary wings.    It continues to eat and grow and moult, and the little wings are moulted  off with the rest of the skin--for the wings of the insect are only  modified parts of the skin.    But there are new and larger wings underneath, and these grow and are  moulted off with the next skin, until, at last, the grasshopper is  full-grown, with full-grown wings.    It will not moult any more after that.    When full-grown, the females lay their eggs.    Where do you suppose they lay their eggs?    Some of them make a hole in the ground.    The end of the abdomen is very strong and sharp, and the locust can make  a hole with it quite easily.    When the hole is made, then the eggs are laid in it, and the locust  covers the opening to the hole with a sticky substance to keep out the  wet.    The eggs usually lie in the ground all winter.    [Illustration]    Just think of the locust eggs there are under our feet as we cross the  fields!    Millions and millions of little eggs are hidden in the ground.    Early in the next summer the little eggs hatch, and then tiny locusts  creep up out of the earth and go hopping about everywhere.    Most of the full-grown locusts die in the fall.    As you know, the young ones have no wings, and this is why there are so  few winged locusts early in the summer.    Some locusts make their holes in fence rails or in old stumps.    It is the locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers, that sometimes come in  swarms that darken the sun.    There is nothing the Western farmer dreads so much as a swarm of  locusts.    I have heard how the grasshoppers came in Kansas one year.    They appeared all of a sudden in countless millions.    They were piled up against the fences clear to the top.    They swarmed into the houses, and in places on the railroad track they  were piled so deep the trains could not run through them.    Think of a railway train being stopped by grasshoppers!    They stripped every leaf from the trees and left them as bare as in  winter.    They ate up every blade of grass.    But in the East they do not do so much damage, though they sometimes  cause the farmers serious loss. When summer comes we may listen to their  cheery din with pleasure.    I am sure we shall enjoy the merry sounds of the grasshoppers all the  more now that we know something about how they are made, and something  about the little fellow that makes them.    [Illustration]          THE LONGHORNED GRASSHOPPERS    [Illustration]      Probably it was the longhorned grasshoppers that Charlie saw so many of  in the meadow.    Look, next time, Charlie, and see if the swarms that start up before you  have not long, slender antennae.    See, here is one.    Its antennae are like threads, and they are longer than its body.    If you were to look at its tarsus, you would find it had four joints  instead of three.    Otherwise, the longhorned, or meadow grasshoppers are very much like the  locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers.    John says he thinks the meadow grasshoppers are more slender and  delicate in shape.    That is true, as a rule, though there are some species of the locusts  that are as slender as the longhorned grasshoppers.    But there is one thing about these longhorned fellows that will amuse  you.    Some of them have ears on their front legs!    It is not uncommon for insects to have hearing organs on their front  legs.    You know what an ear is. It is something to hear with. The hearing part  of our own ears is way inside, out of sight.    The outer part of the ear, that we can take hold of, is only a sort of  funnel to gather up the sound, and we could still hear if this part of  our ears were cut off.    Way back inside the ear is a little curtain, or eardrum, made of a thin  membrane.    When sounds enter the ear they cause the eardrum to tremble or vibrate,  and this excites the nerve of hearing that is behind the eardrum.    Now some grasshoppers have a little flat membrane on the tibia of each  front leg. It is an eardrum. Behind it is the nerve of hearing. When  sounds strike the eardrum it vibrates and excites the nerve of hearing.    [Illustration]    So you see the insects have _ears_, though they have no funnel-like  outsides to them.    So, after all, there isn't so _very_ much difference between the way the  grasshoppers hear, and the way we hear, although they do hear with their  legs.    Yes, Ned, it is about the same thing when they hear with sensitive spots  on their antennae.    The sounds strike the sensitive spots, which are tiny eardrums, and  cause the nerves that come to them to hear.    You see, after all, an ear is only a membrane able to vibrate when  sounds strike it and a nerve sensitive to those sounds.    It does not matter much where the ear is located. Our ears are on either  side of our head, and so are the ears of all the higher animals.    But the ears of the insects are more useful to them when on the antennae,  or the legs, or some have them on the abdomen. An ear is an ear wherever  it happens to be, and the insects hear well enough with theirs.    [Illustration]    In many species of the longhorned grasshoppers, the male has a curious  musical instrument on his wing covers, close to where they grow from the  body.    Little Mr. Grasshopper sings to his lady-love by rubbing the upper parts  of the wing covers together. You see the round places at _X_,--those are  the modified parts of the wing cover, by means of which he can make his  music.    What is that, May? Your grasshopper has a long sword at the end of its  body?    [Illustration]    Yes, that is its ovipositor. Ovipositor means \"egg-placer.\"    With this long, sharp ovipositor the grasshopper can roughen the bark of  twigs or make holes in the stems of plants or in the earth.    Then the eggs are guided down through the long ovipositor to the place  prepared for them, and fastened there by a gummy substance.    [Illustration]    Only the female grasshoppers have the long, sword-shaped ovipositor.    The ovipositor of the locust is not long and sword-like.    It is short, but it is strong and sharp, and you remember how the locust  uses it to dig with.    Yes, indeed, Mollie, there are a great many species of locusts and  grasshoppers, and some of them are very beautiful.    In hot countries they sometimes grow to an enormous size.    May is asking why they make molasses.    No, Ned, of course it isn't molasses. Children call it molasses because  it looks like it.    Now, May, where does it make its molasses?    In its mouth, you say, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#8)"],[1," the enemy, as a careful  inspection through our field-glasses showed.    Immediately in front of us were the buildings and kraals of  Stinkfontein, and there on the opposite bank of the river stood  Paardeberg. To the left and to the right of it were khaki-coloured  groups dotted everywhere about--General Cronje was hemmed in on all  sides, he and his burghers--a mere handful compared with the encircling  multitude.    What a spectacle we saw! All round the laager were the guns of the  English, belching forth death and destruction, while from within it at  every moment, as each successive shell tore up the ground, there rose a  cloud--a dark red cloud of dust.    It was necessary to act--but how?    We decided to make an immediate attack upon the nearest of Lord Roberts'  troops, those which were stationed in the vicinity of Stinkfontein, and  to seize some ridges which lay about two and a half miles south-east of  the laager.    Stinkfontein was about a thousand paces to the north of these ridges,  and perhaps a few hundred paces farther from where Cronje was stationed.    We rode towards the ridges, and when we were from twelve to fourteen  hundred paces from Stinkfontein, we saw that the place was occupied by a  strong force of British troops.    General Botha and I then arranged that he should storm the houses,  kraals and garden walls of Stinkfontein, whilst I charged the ridges.  And this we did, nothing daunted by the tremendous rifle fire which  burst upon us. Cronje's pitiable condition confronted us, and we had but  one thought--could we relieve him?    We succeeded in driving the English out of Stinkfontein, and took sixty  of them prisoners.    The enemy's fire played on us unceasingly, and notwithstanding the fact  that we occupied good positions, we lost two men, and had several of our  horses killed and wounded.    We remained there for two and a half days--from the 22nd to the 25th of  February--and then were forced to retire. While evacuating our  positions, three of my burghers were killed, seven wounded, and fourteen  taken prisoner.    But the reader will justly demand more details as to the surrender of  Cronje, an event which forms one of the most important chapters in the  history of the two Republics. I am able to give the following  particulars.    After we had captured the positions referred to above, I gave orders  that the Krupp and the Maxim-Nordenfeldt should be brought up. For with  our hurried advance, the oxen attached to the big guns, as well as some  of the burghers' horses, had become so fatigued, that the guns and a  number of the burghers had been left behind. The ridges were so thickly  strewn with boulders, that even on the arrival of the guns, it was  impossible to place them in position until we had first cleared a path  for them. I made up my mind to turn these boulders to account by using  them to build _schanzes_, for I knew that a tremendous bombardment would  be opened upon our poor Krupp and Maxim-Nordenfeldt as soon as they made  themselves heard.    During the night we built these _schanzes_, and before the sun rose the  following morning, the guns were placed in position.    By daybreak the English had crept up to within a short distance of our  lines. It was the Krupp and the Maxim-Nordenfeldt that gave our answer.    But we had to be very sparing of our ammunition, for it was almost  exhausted, and it would take at least five days to get a fresh supply  from Bloemfontein.    Our arrival on the previous day had made a way of escape for General  Cronje. It is true that he would have been obliged to leave everything  behind him, but he and his burghers would have got away in safety. The  British had retreated before our advance, thus opening a road between us  and the laager. That road was made yet wider by the fire from our guns.    But General Cronje would not move. Had he done so, his losses would not  have been heavy. His determination to remain in that ill-fated laager  cost him dearly.    The world will honour that great general and his brave burghers; and if  I presume to criticize his conduct on this occasion, it is only because  I believe that he ought to have sacrificed his own ideas for the good of  the nation, and that he should have not been courageous at the expense  of his country's independence, to which he was as fiercely attached as  I.    Some of the burghers in the laager made their escape, for, on the second  day, when our guns had cleared a wide path, Commandants Froneman and  Potgieter (of Wolmaranstadt), with twenty men, came galloping out of  the laager towards us.    Although we were only a few in number, the British had their work cut  out to dislodge us. First they tried their favourite strategy of a  flanking movement, sending out strong columns of cavalry, with heavy  guns to surround us. It was necessary to prevent the fulfilment of this  project. I, therefore, removed the Krupp and the Maxim-Nordenfeldt from  their positions, and divided our little force into three portions. I  ordered the first to remain in their position, the second was to proceed  with the Krupp round our left wing, while I despatched the third party  to hold back the left wing of the British. I had no wish to share  General Cronje's unenviable position.    We succeeded in checking the advance of the enemy's wings; and when he  saw that we were not to be outflanked he changed his tactics, and while  still retaining his wings where they were, in order to keep our men  occupied, he delivered at mid-day, on the 20th, an attack on our centre  with a strong force of infantry.    The result of this was that the British gained one of our positions,  that, namely, which was held by Veldtcornet Meyer, an officer under  Commandant Spruit. Meyer was entirely unable to beat off the attack,  and, at nightfall, was compelled to retire about two or three hundred  paces, to a little ridge, which he held effectively.    As the English took up the abandoned position, they raised a cheer, and  Commandant Spruit, who was ignorant of its meaning, and believed that  his men were still in possession, went there alone.    \"_Hoe gaat het?_\"[22] he called out.    \"Hands up!\" was the reply he received.    There was nothing left for the Commandant to do but to give himself up.  The soldiers led him over a ridge, and struck a light to discover his  identity. Finding papers in his pocket which showed that their prisoner  was an important personage, they raised cheer upon cheer.[23]    I heard them cheering, and thought that the enemy were about to attempt  another attack, and so gave orders that whatever happened our positions  must be held, for they were the key to General Cronje's escape. However,  no attack was delivered.    Nobody could have foreseen that two thousand infantry would give up the  attack on positions which they had so nearly captured, and we all  expected a sanguinary engagement on the following morning. We had made  up our minds to stand firm, for we knew that if General Cronje failed to  make his way out, it would be a real calamity to our great cause.    Fully expecting an attack, we remained all that night at our posts. Not  a man of us slept, but just before dawn we heard this order from the  English lines:    \"Fall in.\"    \"What can be the meaning of this?\" we ask one another.    Lying, sitting or standing, each of us is now at his post, and staring  out into the darkness, expecting an attack every moment. We hold our  breath and listen. Is there no sound of approaching footsteps? And now  the light increases. Is it possible? Yes, our eyes do not deceive us.  The enemy is gone.    Surprise and joy are on every face. One hears on all sides the  exclamation, \"If only Cronje would make the attempt now.\" It was the  morning of the 25th of February.    But the enemy were not to leave us alone for long. By nine o'clock they  were advancing upon us again, with both right and left wing reinforced.  I had only a few shots left for the Krupp, and thirty for the  Maxim-Nordenfeldt, and this last ammunition must now be expended on the  wings. One gun I despatched to the right, the other to the left, and the  English were checked in their advance. I had ordered the gunners, as  soon as they had fired their last round to bring their guns into safe  positions in the direction of Petrusberg. Very soon I observed that this  order was being executed, and thus learnt that the ammunition had run  out.    The burghers who, with their rifles, had attempted to hold back the  wings, now having no longer any support from the big guns, were unable  to stand their ground against the overpowering forces of the enemy, and  shortly after the guns were removed, I saw them retreat.    What was I to do? I was being bombarded incessantly, and since the  morning had been severely harassed by small-arm fire. All this, however,  I could have borne, but now the enemy began to surround me. It was a  hard thing to be thus forced to abandon the key to General Cronje's  escape.    In all haste I ordered my men to retire. They had seen throughout that  this was unavoidable, and had even said to me:    \"If we remain here, General, we shall be surrounded with General  Cronje.\"    All made good their retreat, with the exception of Veldtcornet Speller,  of Wepener, who, to my great regret, was taken prisoner there with  fourteen men. That occurred owing to my adjutant forgetting, in the  general confusion, to give them my orders to retreat. When Speller found  that he, with his fourteen men, was left behind, he defended himself, as  I heard later, with great valour, until at last he was captured by  overpowering numbers. It cost the English a good many dead and wounded  to get him out of his _schanzes_.    Although I had foreseen that our escape would be a very difficult and  lengthy business, I had not thought that we should have been in such  danger of being made prisoners.
