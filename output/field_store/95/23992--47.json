When the birds rose, Tahuti and his father let fly their  throw-sticks, and when a bird was knocked down, the cat, which had been  sitting quietly in the bow of the boat, dashed forward among the reeds  and secured the fluttering creature before it could escape.    [Illustration: PLATE 8.  \"AND THE GOOSE STOOD UP AND CACKLED.\"]    Altogether, it was great fun for the brother and sister, as well as for  the grown folks, and Tahuti and Sen-senb liked nothing so well as when  the gaily-painted little skiff was launched for a day on the marshes. I  think that, on the whole, they had a very bright and happy life in these  old days, and that, though they had not many of the advantages that you  have to-day, the boys and girls of three thousand years ago managed to  enjoy themselves in their own simple way quite as well as you do now.          CHAPTER VII    SOME FAIRY-TALES OF LONG AGO      The little brown boys and girls who lived in Egypt three thousand years  ago were just as fond as you are of hearing wonderful stories that begin  with \"Once upon a time;\" and I want in this chapter to tell you some of  the tales that Tahuti and Sen-senb used to listen to in the evening when  school was over and play was done--the oldest of all wonder-tales,  stories that were old and had long been forgotten, ages before The  Sleeping Beauty and Jack and the Beanstalk were first thought of.    One day, when King Khufu, the great King who built the biggest of the  Pyramids, had nothing else to do, he called his sons and his wise men  together, and said, \"Is there anyone among you who can tell me the tales  of the old magicians?\" Then the King's son, Prince Baufra, stood up and  said, \"Your Majesty, I can tell you of a wonder that happened in the  days of your father, King Seneferu. It fell on a day that the King grew  weary of everything, and sought through all his palace for something to  please him, but found nothing. Then he said to his officers, 'Bring to  me the magician Zazamankh.' And when the magician came, the King said to  him, 'O Zazamankh, I have sought through all my palace for some delight,  and I have found none.' Then said Zazamankh, 'Let thy Majesty go in thy  boat upon the lake of the palace, and let twenty beautiful girls be  brought to row thee, and let their oars be of ebony, inlaid with gold  and silver. And I myself will go with thee; and the sight of the  water-birds, and the fair shores, and the green grass will cheer thy  heart.' So the King and the wizard went down to the lake, and the twenty  maidens rowed them about in the King's pleasure-galley. Nine rowed on  this side, and nine on that, and the two fairest stood by the two  rudders at the stern, and set the rowing song, each for her own side.  And the King's heart grew glad and light, as the boat sped hither and  thither, and the oars flashed in the sunshine to the song of the rowers.    \"But as the boat turned, the top of the steering-oar struck the hair of  one of the maidens who steered, and knocked her coronet of turquoise  into the water; and she stopped her song, and all the rowers on her  side stopped rowing. Then his Majesty said, 'Why have you stopped  rowing, little one?' And the maiden answered, 'It is because my jewel of  turquoise has fallen into the water.' 'Row on,' said the King, 'and I  will give you another.' But the girl answered, 'I want my own one back,  as I had it before.' So King Seneferu called Zazamankh to come to him,  and said, 'Now, Zazamankh, I have done as you advised, and my heart is  light; but, behold, the coronet of this little one has fallen into the  water, and she has stopped singing, and spoiled the rowing of her side;  and she will not have a new jewel, but wants the old one back again.'    \"Then Zazamankh the wizard stood up in the King's boat, and spoke  wonderful words. And, lo! the water of one half of the lake rose up, and  heaped itself upon the top of the water of the other half, so that it  was twice as deep as it was before. And the King's bark rode upon the  top of the piled-up waters; but beyond it the bottom of the lake lay  bare, with the shells and pebbles shining in the sunlight. And there,  upon a broken shell, lay the little rower's coronet. Then Zazamankh  leaped down and picked it up, and brought it to the King. And he spake  wonderful words again, and the water sank down, and covered the whole  bed of the lake, as it had done at first. So his Majesty spent a joyful  day, and gave great rewards to the wizard Zazamankh.\"    When King Khufu heard that story, he praised the men of olden times. But  another of his sons, Prince Hordadef, stood up, and said, \"O King, that  is only a story of bygone days, and no one knows whether it is true or a  lie; but I will show thee a magician of to-day.\" \"Who is he, Hordadef?\"  said King Khufu. And Hordadef answered, \"His name is Dedi. He is a  hundred and ten years old, and every day he eats five hundred loaves of  bread, and a side of beef, and drinks a hundred jugs of beer. He knows  how to fasten on a head that has been cut off. He knows how to make a  lion of the desert follow him, and he knows the plan of the house of God  that you have wanted to know for so long.\"    Then King Khufu sent Prince Hordadef to bring Dedi to him, and he  brought Dedi back in the royal boat. The King came out, and sat in the  colonnade of the palace, and Dedi was led before him. Then said his  Majesty, \"Why have I never seen you before, Dedi?\" And Dedi answered,  \"Life, health, strength to your Majesty! A man can only come when he is  called.\" \"Is it true, Dedi, that you can fasten on a head which has been  cut off?\" \"Certainly I can, your Majesty.\" Then said the King, \"Let a  prisoner be brought from the prison, and let his head be struck off.\"  But Dedi said, \"Long life to your Majesty; do not try it on a man. Let  us try a bird or an animal.\"    So a goose was brought; its head was cut off; and the head was laid at  the east side of the hall, and the body at the west. Then Dedi rose, and  spoke wonderful words. And, behold! the body of the goose waddled to  meet the head, and the head came to meet the body. They joined together  before his Majesty's throne, and the goose stood up and cackled (Plate  8).    Then, when Dedi had joined to its body again the head that had been  struck off from an ox, and the ox followed him lowing, King Khufu said  to him, \"Is it true, O Dedi, that you know the plans of the house of  God?\" \"It is true, your Majesty; but it is not I who shall give them to  you.\" \"Who, then?\" said the King. \"It is the eldest of three sons who  shall be born to the lady Rud-didet, wife of the priest of Ra, the  Sun-God. And Ra has promised that these three sons shall reign over this  kingdom of thine.\" When King Khufu heard that word, his heart was  troubled; but Dedi said, \"Let not your Majesty's heart be troubled. Thy  son shall reign first, then thy son's son, and then one of these.\" So  the King commanded that Dedi should live in the house of Prince  Hordadef; and that every day there should be given to him a thousand  loaves, a hundred jugs of beer, an ox, and a hundred bunches of onions!    When the three sons of Rud-didet were born, Ra sent four goddesses to be  their godmothers. They came attired like travelling dancing-girls; and  one of the gods came with them, dressed like a porter. And when they had  nursed the three children awhile, Rud-didet's husband said to them, \"My  ladies, what wages shall I give you?\" So he gave them a bushel of  barley, and they went away with their wages. But when they had gone a  little way, Isis, the chief of them, said, \"Why have we not done a  wonder for these children?\" So they stopped, and made crowns, the red  crown and the white crown of Egypt, and hid them in the bushel of  barley, and sealed the sack, and put it in Rud-didet's store-chamber,  and went away again.    A fortnight later, when Rud-didet was going to brew the household beer,  there was no barley. And her maidservant said, \"There is a bushel, but  it was given to the dancing-girls, and lies in the store-room, sealed  with their seal.\" So the lady said to her maid, \"Go down and fetch it,  and we shall give them more when they need it.\" The maid went down, but  when she came to the store-room, lo! from within there came a sound of  singing and dancing, and all such music as should be heard in a King's  Court. So in fear she crept back to her mistress and told her, and  Rud-didet went down and heard the royal music, and she told her husband  when he came home at night, and their hearts were glad because their  sons were to be Kings.    But after a time the lady Rud-didet quarrelled with her maid, and gave  her a beating, as ladies sometimes did in those days; and the weeping  maid said to her fellow-servants, \"Shall she do this to me? She has  borne three Kings, and I will go and tell it to his Majesty, King  Khufu.\" So she stole away first to her uncle, and told him of her plot;  but he was angry because she wished to betray the children to King  Khufu, and he beat her with a scourge of flax. And as she went away by  the side of the river a great crocodile came out of the water, and  carried her off.... But here, alas! our story breaks off; the rest of  the book is lost, and we cannot tell whether King Khufu tried to kill  the three royal babies or not. Only we do know that the first three  Kings of the race which succeeded the race of Khufu bore the same names  as Rud-didet's three babies, and were called, like all the Kings of  Egypt after them, \"Sons of the Sun.\"    These, then, are absolutely the oldest fairy-stories in the world, and  if they do not seem very"]]]
