The female had in      her hand a fan formed of the tail feathers of a turkey. The      points of these feathers were curiously bound by a buckskin      string, well dressed, and were thus closely bound for about      one inch from the points. About three inches from the point      they were again bound, by another deer skin string, in such a      manner that the fan might be closed and expanded at pleasure.      * * *        The cave in which they were found, abounded in nitre,      copperas, alum, and salts. The whole of this covering, with      the baskets, was perfectly sound, without any marks of      decay.[51]        There was also a scoop net made of bark thread; a mockasin      made of the like materials; a mat of the same materials,      enveloping human bones, were found in saltpetre dirt, six      feet below the surface. The net and other things mouldered on      being exposed to the sun.[52]    In the year 1815 a remarkably interesting set of mortuary fabrics was  recovered from a saltpeter cave near Glasgow, Kentucky. A letter from  Samuel L. Mitchell, published by the American Antiquarian Society,  contains the following description of the condition of the human remains  and of the nature of its coverings:        The outer envelope of the body is a deer skin, probably dried      in the usual way, and perhaps softened before its      application, by rubbing. The next covering is a deer skin,      whose hair had been cut away by a sharp instrument,      resembling a hatter's knife. The remnant of the hair, and the      gashes in the skin, nearly resemble the sheared pelt of      beaver. The next wrapper of cloth is made of twine doubled      and twisted. But the thread does not appear to have been      formed by the wheel, nor the web by the loom. The warp and      filling seemed to have been crossed and knotted by an      operation like that of the fabricks of the northwest coast,      and of the Sandwich islands. * * * The innermost tegument is      a mantle of cloth like the preceding; but furnished with      large brown feathers, arranged and fastened with great art,      so as to be capable of guarding the living wearer from wet      and cold. The plumage is distinct and entire, and the whole      bears a near similitude to the feathery cloaks now worn by      the nations of the northwestern coast of America.[53]    The Bureau of Ethnology had the good fortune to secure recently a number  of representative pieces of burial fabrics of the classes mentioned in  the preceding extracts, and somewhat detailed descriptions of these will  sufficiently illustrate the art as practiced by the early inhabitants of  the middle portions of the country.    The relics which have come into the possession of the Bureau were  obtained in 1885 by Mr. A. J. McGill from a rock shelter on \"Clifty\" or  Cliff Creek, Morgan county, Tennessee. Mr. J. W. Emmert, through whom  they were procured, reports that they were found in a grave 31/2 feet  below the surface and in earth strongly charged with niter and perhaps  other preservative salts. The more pliable cloths, together with skeins  of vegetal fiber, a dog's skull, some bone tools, and portions of human  bones and hair, were rolled up in a large split-cane mat. The grave was  situated about as shown in the accompanying section (figure 4). A shelf  some 20 feet in width, with depressed floor, occurs about midway between  the creek bed and the slightly overhanging ledge above, the whole height  being estimated at 300 feet.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. III  MANTLE OR SKIRT OF LIGHT-COLORED STUFF.]    The mat, a very excellent piece of work, is 6 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 4  inches. By reference to plate II it will be seen that it is neatly and  artistically made and quite well preserved. The strands are from  one-third to three-sixteenths of an inch in width and are even on the  edges and smoothly dressed on the back. The hard, glistening outer  surface of the cane is light in color and the dressed surface is dark  naturally or artificially, and the weaving is so managed that a tasteful  border and a checkered effect are produced by alternately exposing the  light and dark sides. This piece probably very fairly represents the  split-cane work of the whole cane-producing region. A similar piece of  work from the gulf coast is illustrated in figure 12.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Section of cliff showing position of grave  shelter.]    Inclosed with the mat were three pieces of fabric of especial interest,  all pertaining, no doubt, to the costume of the person buried. The piece  of cloth shown in plate III probably served as a mantle or skirt and is  46 inches long by 24 wide. It is of coarse, pliable, yellowish-gray  stuff, woven in the twined style so common all over America. The fiber  was doubtless derived from the native hemp, and the strands are neatly  twisted and about the size of average wrapping cord. The warp strands,  24 inches in length, extend across the piece; and on the left margin, as  seen in the illustration, they are looped for the passage of a gathering  string, while on the left they have been cut to form a short fringe. The  opposing series (the woof strands) have been passed through with the  length of the cloth in pairs, which are twisted half around at each  intersection, inclosing the web strands in alternating pairs as shown in  detail in figure 5. These twined strands are placed three-eights of an  inch apart, the web being so close that the fabric is but slightly open.  The twined strands are carried back and forth in groups of four as shown  at the ends in the plate, and are knotted as illustrated in the figure.    A piece of fabric of much interest is presented in plate IV. It may be  an unfinished garment of the class shown in the preceding illustration,  but it is more likely a complete skirt, the narrow woven band with its  gathering string serving as a belt and the long fringe being the skirt.  The length at the gathered edge is 34 inches, and the pendant length is  20 inches. The material and the weaving are the same as in the piece of  cloth already described, although the work is somewhat coarser. A  detailed study of the border is given in figure 6, the vertical series  of threads being pulled apart to show more distinctly the manner of  combination.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Portion of mantle showing manner of weaving.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Analysis of the weaving of fringed skirt. Threads  natural size.]    The two pieces just described would seem to correspond pretty closely  with the garments formerly worn by women and girls of the lower  Mississippi country, as illustrated by Du Pratz in a plate facing page  310, volume II, of his Histoire de la Louisiane. His plate is reproduced  in figure 7. The following are translations of his descriptions of the  garments delineated:        The women in warm weather have only a half ell of limbourg,      with which they are covered; they fold this cloth around the      body and are well clothed from the waist to the knees; when      they have no limbourg they use in the same way a deer      skin.[54].        When the girls reach the age of eight or nine years they are      clothed from the waist to the ankles with a fringe of threads      of mulberry bark, fastened to a band    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. IV  FRINGED SKIRT.]        which is attached below the abdomen; there is also another      band above the abdomen which meets the first at the back;      between the two the body is covered in front by a network      which is held there by the bands, and at the back there are      merely two large cords, each having a tassel.[55]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Former costumes of woman and girl in Louisiana  (after Du Pratz).]    Of equal interest to the preceding is the badly frayed bag shown in  plate V. It is 20 inches in length and 13 inches in depth. The style of  weaving is the same as that of the two preceding examples; a peculiar  open effect is produced by the rotting out of certain strands of dark  color, which were arranged in pairs alternating with eight lighter  threads. The construction of the border or rim of this bag is quite  remarkable. As shown in figure 8, the upper ends of the vertical    strands are gathered in slightly twisted groups of four and carried up  free for about two inches, when they are brought together and plaited  with remarkable neatness into a string border. As if to convey to the  curious investigator of modern times a complete knowledge of their  weavers' art, the friends of the dead deposited with the body not only  the fabrics worn during life but a number of skeins of the fiber from  which the fabrics were probably made. This fiber has been identified as  that of the _Cannabis sativa_, or wild hemp. Two of the skeins are shown  in plate V.    The presence of these unworked materials makes it probable that the  individual burned was a female, for the distaff and the loom have been  and are universal emblems of the practical enslavement of that sex.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Border of bag.]    A small but very instructive group of burial fabrics is preserved in the  National Museum. These specimens were found with a desiccated body in  1877 in a cave 8 miles from Mammoth cave, Kentucky. They consist of a  number of bags and other articles woven in the usual styles of bast and  hemp. Nearly all of the articles are worn or fragmentary, but the fiber  is wonderfully preserved and the original colors are as fresh as if the  burial had taken place but yesterday. There are three wide-mouthed,  shallow bags, resembling the one from Tennessee illustrated in plate V.  The largest is 34 inches long when closed, and 15 inches deep. Both web  and woof are of bast.

She annoys the good Herr Kirtley.\" And he  would toddle out, slamming the door like a clap of thunder.    The family assumed a very self-conscious behavior when the lorn  maiden was mentioned, and were anxious Gard should know that, while  unfortunately she was their neighbor, she was not at all of their  stratum.    \"Poor girl!\" Gard mused. There were nearly half again as many women  as men in Saxony.    At last he came to know there seemed to be a mystery about Fraeulein  Elsa--something which was hidden from him. And a new and deeper  interest was summoned forth from within his breast. Occasionally at  table she was silent as a mile stone. Some days she did not appear  to his sight at all. And then, when he did see her, she evidently  wanted to avoid him. Very true it was that she often pored over the  little volume of Heine in her room without a word to anyone. But, of  a sudden, she would become frankly in evidence again--a floral and  quite superb girl, resolutely \"making good,\" as was her wont.    \"What is it?\" Gard wondered.    None of the family ever referred to it. Even in his intimate talks  with her mother, whom Gard now and then practiced his German upon as  she was plying her needle, nothing was divulged. There was no young  German coming to the house with regularity. Consequently, could it  be love difficulties? Yet something was wrong. It lent respect to  Elsa, threw enhancement about her.    Gard concluded that the roughness of the Bucher family life  mortified her. It was often well-nigh outlandish. How could she  have so ardently studied the beautiful in music and colors without  realizing this?    But he had not been long enough in Germany to be advised that  knowledge is not expected there to enter into the inner life. What  one is has little in common with what one knows or can dexterously  do. Study does not pass into character. The German, with all his  acquirements, does not look for moral or esthetic effect upon the  heart or soul.    German women esteem the strong fighter, the rugged accomplisher the  boisterous enthusiast, among their men. Whether these are atheistic,  immoral, boorish, cruel, are considerations of secondary importance.  The daughters marry them with little hesitation. Men are men,  supreme, to be adored. Women are to be tolerated, stepped on, sat  upon. Man is the master, woman is the willing servant.          CHAPTER IX    A JOURNALIST      Gard's experience in perfecting himself in German met with another  rebuff. Under the prompting of his parental friends in Villa Elsa he  concluded at length to attend a course of lectures given by a  celebrated professor who was, however, known to be of an  exceptionally cantankerous disposition. Kirtley had become aware of  the querulous restrictions and exactions attending the most peaceful  German activities and made sure of his ground at the class room,  whither he went one morning with encouraging expectations. He asked  the janitor if the hearings were free and public. They were.    It was the usual amphitheater and Gard entered to find only a few  regular students down in the front rows. He decided on a seat alone  in the center. Herr Professor, be-spectacled, soon clambered up on  the rostrum and squatted dumpily. Blear-eyed he scanned the place  and blurted out:    \"There is a stranger in the room. The lecture will not proceed until  he departs.\" Gard, having been assured by the janitor, could not  imagine that he himself was meant. The man of prodigious learning  shouted angrily, throwing out his arm toward Kirtley:    \"Must I repeat that there is a foreigner in the audience? I shall  not begin until his presence has been removed.\"    Gard went away, incensed. Surely, he swore to himself, Teuton  erudition acts so often like a mad bear ready to claw away at men  and things. He never attended another day lecture.    But he had to get on with his German. He decided to put an  advertisement for an instructor in the Dresden _Nachrichten_. At its  _bureau_ he ran counter to a lot of ifs and ands at the hands of a  surly young clerk. A German, naturally gruff, only needs a small  position to increase his acerbity. His newspapers display, likewise,  a disagreeable officiousness, being nearly always, to some extent,  bureaucratic organs. They are lords, not servants, of the public.  They do not appear to want your business, your money.    Gard's imperfect German balked him, too. After he had been back and  forth to the little window three or four times, trying to alter his  \"ad\" to suit the rasping individual whose face Gard could scarcely  catch a glimpse of by stooping down to the aperture, an American  stepped forward. He was a steel gray man of about sixty and was  inserting a notice. He said he was familiar with all the rigors of  such a proceeding, being a correspondent for the Chicago _Gazette_.    \"Perhaps I can help,\" volunteered Miles Anderson. \"After having had  scraps and fights about this sort of thing around this country for  seven years--though the Germans won't fight--I've finally got the  hang of it. You can save three or four words by a different jargon.  I can see you are an American because you take up more room about  this than necessary. German economy, you must remember.\"    Gard was glad to find a friend of his race. And after the  advertisement was disposed of, they repaired to a neighboring beer  hall to refresh and relieve their feelings. Anderson was  smooth-shaven, with piercing gray eyes under bushy eyebrows, his  head presenting the appearance of just having been in a barber's  chair. With the insistent curiosity of a practiced interviewer he  wanted to know why Kirtley had come to this godless land; where he  was hanging out; and all about the Buchers.    A bachelor, Anderson had become toughened by hotel and _pension_. He  thought Kirtley very fortunate in getting right into a family where  the veritable German bloom had not been rubbed off by foreigners, by  boarders. It would be a most fragrant experience. Here Kirtley would  see on the native heath the genuine German of the great middle class  that makes up the might of the nation.    \"Can you read German comfortably?\" asked Anderson. \"What do you make  of it? I've been studying it for seven years and sometimes it seems  as if I hadn't got much further than the verb to hate.\"    \"You can't give me any short cuts about it, then?\" laughed Gard.    \"Yes, I can--yes, I can. Here's a little compilation and analysis of  the irregular verbs,\" explained his new acquaintance, pulling a  green brochure from his pocket. \"Only costs a mark. You can get a  second-hand one at the book stalls by the Augustus bridge. I always  carry it with me and con it over and over. Good for the  pronunciation. If you get the irregular verbs of a language well fed  into your system, you've got the language by the windpipe.    \"Then buy _Simplicissimus_. You'll pick up a good deal from  that--the popular expressions, the phrases and exclamations that are  going. If you learn to use the exclamations, it makes you  interesting and well-liked. It gives the other fellow the chance to  do the talking. _Simplicissimus_ and that kind of thing are better  than the dry, stilted German classics--'Ekkehard,' 'Nathan der  Weise' and all that discarded stuff. But remember that _esprit_ was  not given the Germans, because it would hide their Boeotian  stupidity.\"    \"I haven't yet seen--I suppose I shall see\"--said Kirtley, \"why the  general American student like me is so persistently encouraged to  come to Germany. Why is it?\"    \"Because we are damn fools,\" heartily rejoined Anderson. \"The  Germans don't have education. They have instruction. The one makes  gentlemen. The other makes experts. It is hard for an expert to be a  gentleman. They don't have gentlemen in Germany. No such word in  their language. It is a nation of experts, but that's precisely the  reason it should be feared. Why, education would teach a German not  to slobber at his meals.    \"It is his strenuous ingrowing instruction that cultivates his  extreme national egotism until it has become like a boil. His racial  egoism helps obscure the obscure sunlight here in Germany and blinds  him. He has to wear spectacles. It is a natural cry, his cry for a  place in the sun.\"    \"Should I have gone to England or France?\" suggested Gard.    \"Yes. At any rate, not here. The German procedure roughens the fiber  and lowers the moral standards of the general student. Instruction  here is along mental and manual lines. The Teuton is meant to be a  specialist. He is competent but not refined.\"    The two compatriots gossiped along about this and that.    \"I'm having a devil of a time sleeping on my bed,\" confessed Gard.  \"You ought to know about German beds. How do you get on with them?\"    \"The German bed helps to give the German his bad disposition. I put  two beds side by side and sleep across the middle. That's one way to  fool the German bed. If I saw yours I might be able to suggest  something.\"    Anderson frankly expressed a desire to visit the Loschwitz home. So  on Gard's invitation they had lunch and went out to his suburb.          CHAPTER X    SPIES AND WAR      They took off the bed clothes, including the two huge feather  bolsters in the center.    \"These bolsters are for the gingerbread effect that the German likes  everywhere,\" explained the visitor. They examined the remaining  construction. It was narrow and short. It suggested a granite-like  base.    \"Rock of Ages!\" commented Anderson. \"As you can't ask for an  additional bed, all I can see is for you to swill beer and then you  don't care where you sleep. That's the way the Germans do.\"    The journalist appeared disappointed in not meeting any of the  family that first day. Frau was overwhelmed in kitchen duties and  not presentable.
