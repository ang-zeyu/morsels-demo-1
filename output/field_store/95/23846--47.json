[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#8)"],[1,"left my hands when I           received the _Journal of Hellenic Studies_ (XII. 2), containing           an article by Mr. Penrose, _On the Ancient Hecatompedon which           occupied the site of the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens_.           Mr. Penrose contends that the old Hekatompedon was a temple of           unusual length in proportion to its width, that it stood on the           site of the Parthenon, and was built 100 years or more before           the Persian invasion. He thinks, too, that the Doric           architectural members built into the Acropolis-wall, which are           referred by Dörpfeld to the archaic temple beside the           Erechtheion, belonged to the building on the site of the           Parthenon. He is led to these assumptions chiefly by masons'           marks on some of the stones of the sub-structure of the           Parthenon. He holds it \"as incontrovertible that the marks have           reference to the building on which they are found.\" The           distances between these marks offer certain numerical relations           which must, Mr. Penrose thinks, correspond to some of the           dimensions of the building to which the marks refer. \"If they           had reference to the Parthenon, they would have shown a number           of exact coincidences with the important sub-divisions of the           temple.\" Of these coincidences Mr. Penrose has found but three,           which he considers fortuitous. As accessory arguments he           adduces the condition of the filling in to the south of the  Page 17  Parthenon, and the absence of old architectural material in the           sub-structure of the Parthenon, _etc_. He seems, however, to           rest his case chiefly upon the masons' marks.             I cannot even attempt to discuss this new theory in detail, but           would mention one or two things which seem to tell against Mr.           Penrose's view. The inscription published by Lolling mentions           an [Greek: oikema tamieion]  and [Greek: oikemata] as parts of the           Hekatompedon, and such apartments evidently existed in the           temple beside the Erechtheion. Mr. Penrose assumes that the           temple beside the Erechtheion antedates his Hekatompedon,           without regard to the fact that the use of the stone employed           in the outer foundations of the archaic temple points to a much           later period. The archaic temple was (at least approximately)           100 feet long, which makes it seem almost impossible that a new           temple should be built on the Acropolis and called the           Hundred-foot-temple (Hekatompedon). I cannot avoid attaching           more importance to these considerations than to the arguments           advanced by Mr. Penrose. It may be, however, that answers to           these and other objections will be found.             If Mr. Penrose's theory is correct, it is evident that the old           Hekatompedon must have ceased to exist before the building of           the Parthenon. Whether the archaic temple excavated in 1886           continued to exist or not is, then, another matter. My main           contention (that there is no good reason for assuming the           continued existence through the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.           of the archaic temple) is not affected by Mr. Penrose's theory,           and I leave my arguments, such as they are, for the           consideration alike of those who do and who do not agree with           Mr. Penrose. Much of my article will appear irrelevant to the           former class, but, as Mr. Penrose's views may not be at once           generally accepted, it is as well to leave the discussion of           previous theories as it was before the appearance of Mr.           Penrose's article.             H. N. F.               NOTE.--For a discussion of Mr. Penrose's theories and           conclusions, see now (Nov. 1892), Dörpfeld, _Ath. Mitth.,_           XVII, pp. 158, ff.    Page 18               NOTES ON THE SUBJECTS OF GREEK TEMPLE           SCULPTURES.               The following compilation is intended to present in compact           form the evidence at present available on this question: How           far did the Greeks choose, for the sculptured decorations of a           temple, subjects connected with the principal divinity or           divinities worshiped in that temple? We have omitted some           examples of sculpture in very exceptional situations, _e.g._,           the sculptured drums of the sixth century and fourth century           temples of Artemis at Ephesos. Acroteria have also been           omitted. But we have attempted to include every Greek temple           known to have had pediment-figures or sculptured metopes or           frieze, and have thus, for the sake of completeness, registered           some examples which are valueless for the main question. The           groups from Delos, attributed on their first discovery to the           pediments of the Apollon-temple, have been proved by           Furtwängler to have been acroteria (_Arch, Zeitung_, 1882, p.           336 ff.) It does not appear that Lebas had any good grounds for           attributing to a temple the relief found by him at Rhamnus           (_Voyage archéologique Monuments figurés_, No. 19,) and now in           Munich. The frieze from Priene representing a gigantomachy was           not a part of the temple there (Wolters, _Jahrbuch des           deutschen arch. Instituts_, I, pp. 56, ff.) The Poseidon and           Amphitrite frieze in Munich (Brunn, _Beschreibung der           Glyptothek_, No. 115) has been, by some, taken for a piece of           temple decoration, but is too doubtful an example to be           catalogued. The statement of Pausanias (II. 11. 8) about the           pediment-sculptures ([Greek: ta en tois aetois]) of the           Asklepieion at Titane is hopelessly inadequate and perhaps           inaccurate.             The order of arrangement in the following table is roughly           chronological, absolute precision being impossible. Ionic  Page 19  temples are designated by a prefixed asterisk, the one           Corinthian by a dagger. The others are Doric, and, in the ease           of these, \"Sculptures of the Exterior Frieze\" refers, of           course, to sculptured metopes.             It has not been our purpose to discuss at length the           conclusions to be drawn from this evidence. Briefly, the           results may be summarized as follows:             The principal sculpture (_i.e._, sculpture of the principal           pediment, or, in the absence of pediment-sculpture, the frieze           in the most important situation) included the figure of the           temple divinity, generally in central position, in the           following numbers: [A] 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 26. If 12,           14 and 32 had no pediment-sculptures, they should be added;           probably also 33 and 34. In 30 the subject of the           pediment-sculpture, if correctly divined by Conze, was, at any           rate, closely related to the temple-divinities.             [Footnote A: In counting the Aigina temple we commit           deliberately a _circulus in probando_.]             The principal sculpture apparently did not include or           especially refer to the temple-divinity in the following: 20,           24, 25. Practice would seem to have become somewhat relaxed           after about 425 B.C. The very singular temple of Assos, (No.           5), though earlier, should perhaps be added.             The temple-divinity was represented in the western pediments of           7, 13 and perhaps of 20, but not of that in 9, 11, 24 (?) or           25.             The subjects of sculptured metopes and friezes were largely or           wholly without obvious relation to the temple-divinity in the           following: 1, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 1.9, 23, 29, 32.

Despite its abundant  natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.  Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the  population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to  the economy, contributing about 50% to GDP. Notwithstanding the  signing of a peace accord in November 1994, sporadic violence  continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are  reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the  country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich  resources-gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,  arable land, and large oil deposits-Angola will need to implement the  peace agreement and reform government policies. Despite the high  inflation and political difficulties, total output grew an estimated  9% in 1996, largely due to increased oil production and higher oil  prices.
