Luckily our water-skin is full, and the  horses have drunk well; but I fear what the morning will show.\"    All night we could hear the buck moving about and passing through there  must have been thousands of them. All night, too, the roaring  continued, culminating shortly before daybreak with the most terrific  uproar in the direction of the pool it was possible to imagine.    There the lions seemed to be making a combined attack, and judging by  the sounds they were also fighting among themselves. As soon as it was  daylight we hurried anxiously in that direction, keeping our rifles  ready, although, as a rule, lions are little to be feared by daylight,  unless disturbed at their meal. They were even more numerous than we  had imagined, for huge dun-colored forms slunk off in all directions  through the bush as we neared the water. \"Water!\" did I say? There was  no water now, for Inyati's fears had been well-founded. The little pool  had been trampled into black mud by countless gemsbok, and the various  half-eaten carcasses strewn about showed that the lions had taken heavy  toll of them.    Not without cost to themselves, however; for there in the centre of  what had been the pool lay a huge lion, dead, transfixed and impaled  upon the long, sharp, straight horns of the magnificent gemsbok bull,  that lay, with broken neck, almost hidden beneath the lion's formidable  bulk.    \"Wow!\" said Inyati; \"I have heard of the like before. He was a strong  bull, that old one, and held his horns straight to meet the lion's  spring. And, as I feared, master, the water is gone.\"    It was obvious that nothing could be done with the black mud before us,  for where it still remained moist it was full of blood and filth; and a  decision thus forced upon us, we but waited till the power of the sun  had somewhat abated before striking once more into the desert, due  east. Our horses were rested and refreshed, and we pushed on throughout  the night, till just before dawn we stumbled through a small patch of  t'samma, and immediately decided to give our horses the benefit of  them. Unfortunately, daylight showed the patch to be but a tiny one,  where an arbitrary shower had fallen at the right season, and it barely  sufficed for the day.    And so for days we pushed on incessantly, often going many miles out of  our course to visit one of the many pans we now came across frequently,  but failing in every case to find enough water to even replenish our  water-skin. T'samma we found occasionally, sufficient, at any rate, to  keep us and our animals alive, but barely; and the horrible anxiety of  constant fear of a death by thirst had began to tell upon me badly. Not  so Inyati, who, thirsty or satisfied, was always cheerful, always  optimistic that we should eventually find a way through to his country  of many diamonds and many wives! Many a weary trek that had landed us  waterless and still further involved in the vast wilderness of dunes,  had seen me sink despondent on the sand, caring but little whether I  ever tried to struggle farther; to be roused from my lethargy by the  cheery whimsicalities of this Micawber of the desert.    He would bring out the blue diamond and pretend to consult it as an  oracle, and it would always promise him wonderful things! Sometimes for  game was now scarce it would be a fat buck for breakfast; sometimes a  vast plain of t'samma, or a big pool of water; and his prophecies  always ended in unlimited diamonds and unlimited wives! And cheered by  this nonsense, I would shake off the fit of despondency, and struggle  on; though as time went on I often thought of Van der Decken, the  \"Flying Dutchman,\" and his endless effort to weather the Cape of  Storms.    For our endless zigzagging in search of the wherewithal to live, though  it had brought us to the very heart of the vast desert, had taken us  far from the true direction of what we were in search of, nor could all  our efforts find us a way through.    The moon was with us now again, and we trekked at night, seldom riding,  but plodding doggedly through the endless succession of dunes, with the  spiritless horses strung out behind us. Their hooves were splayed to an  enormous size through this incessant trekking through the sand; yet,  though broken and enfeebled, they had become more inured to the  conditions, and the few t'samma, or tubers dug from the sand for them,  sufficed to keep them alive.    I had ceased to take account of the time, but there came a day when we  came upon a tract where rain had fallen in abundance some time before.  For from an absolutely barren dune, we suddenly looked down upon a  thick garden of beautiful flowers; tall, and like a slender foxglove in  appearance, they filled the wide hollows between the dunes in all  directions. They were of endless variety in color, white, mauve, and an  endless gamut of pinks, down to the deepest purple; and a more  beautiful sight it would be impossible to imagine. But thickly as they  grew for mile after mile, there was nothing else, no t'samma or any  other refreshing plant or fruit, and the hungry horses would not look  at them. I noticed, too, that Inyati seemed none too pleased at finding  this gorgeous garden, and climbed dune after dune to peer in all  directions as the sun rose on the morning we found it.    \"We must cross it quickly, or go round,\" he said, as I stood beside him  on the top of a high dune. \"It is a poison flower, and makes one sleep  and to sleep among it is to die. But I see no way round!\" Far on the  horizon we could see the clouds rising from a pan in the right  direction.    \"We must go on,\" said Inyati, \"and cross this belt of poison flower by  day, when it will harm us but little; to be among it after sundown is  to sleep and to sleep among it is to die.\"    I had heard of this poison flower before, but had never heard of its  being found in such abundance as to be a danger to life. It looked too  beautiful to be harmful, and its perfume was but faint. But Inyati knew  it well, and I could see that he was anxious, as after a short rest we  trekked on through the never-ending stretches of gorgeous coloring,  through them, as through a cornfield. And soon I found that even now in  the glaring sunshine when they were considered innocuous, their perfume  had a peculiar effect upon me, and long before we had half crossed to  the pan I was seized with an overpowering desire to sleep. I nodded as  I stumbled along nothing seemed to matter why should we worry to go  farther, why not lie down and rest, and sleep?    I must have stumbled and fallen, drugged with the insidious poison of  the faint perfume, for I came to myself lying upon the ground among the  flowers, and with Inyati shaking me violently and shouting in my ear. I  was drunk with sleep, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he  induced me to mount the only horse still capable of carrying me. We  were parched with thirst, and our plight was perhaps worse than it had  ever been, for all around stretched the fatal flowers, and it might  well be that we could not clear them before night fell, and their  poison became overpowering in its strength. On the horse, my head  cleared somewhat, probably because I was higher from the ground, where  the perfume hung heavily, although I could not rid myself of the  drowsiness. At midday we were forced to halt for a rest forced, too, to  take it in the glaring sun, on the top of a bare dune, for we dare not  even cover ourselves with a bundle of the plants for fear of the  poison. An hour or two we sat and grilled, and then forced ourselves  onward once more, for the pan was still distant, and we feared we  should not reach it before dark which would mean we would never reach  it at all! But struggle as we would, we could make but little progress,  and it was with mortal fear that I beheld the sun sink, and saw from a  high dune that there was fully a mile of thick flowers between us and  the pan, where dark bush and big trees showed plainly, and where the  flowers ended abruptly.    \"Let us stay here,\" I urged Inyati, \"surely we are safe here on the top  of the dune?\" for we were fully fifty feet above the sea of flowers.    \"No, master, no!\" he answered emphatically; \"if it were twice the  height we should die before the night is out. Push through we must,  even if we leave all our pack here and return for it tomorrow; and the  horses must come too, or we shall lose them. Nothing could live here  through the night.\" Hastily, as he spoke, he threw off the horses'  already light loads, leaving everything but his beloved \"little gun\" on  the top of the dune, and dragging the halter of the leading beast, he  started down the slope. Instantly on entering the dense growth I felt  the effect of the scent, which was now, although the sun had barely  disappeared, ten times stronger than it had been in the sunlight. No  faint sweetness now, but an overpowering scent similar to that of the  well-known \"moon-lilies\" but infinitely stronger, and stupefying to a  degree. Before fifty yards were traversed my head was spinning, and I  was staggering like a drunken man. I remember Inyati half dragging me  on to the horse again and feeling him lashing me to girth and saddle,  remember his hoarse shouts to the horse and myself becoming fainter,  remember dimly that the sjambok he flogged the horse with fell  frequently across my back and legs, but nothing could keep me from the  overwhelming desire to sleep And then all was a blank.         CHAPTER V I LOSE INYATI         Water! Delicious cold water, being dashed in my face and trickling  down my parched throat, brought me again to my senses. I lay, sore and  bruised and with throbbing head and limbs, beside some tall reeds,  between which water glittered in the light of the rising moon.    Inyati bent over me and he uttered an exclamation of joy as I opened my  eyes.    \"Master! master! I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#8)"],[1,"often complain and to  the cause of many variations otherwise unaccountable, and it suggests  particular caution as to the first male employed in the coupling of  animals, a matter which has often been deemed of little consequence in  regard to cattle, inasmuch as fewer heifers' first calves are reared,  than of such as are borne subsequently.    Another faint ray of light touching the causes of variation is  afforded us by the fact that the qualities of offspring are not only  dependent on the habitual conditions of the parents, but also upon any  peculiar condition existing at the time of sexual congress. For  instance, the offspring of parents ordinarily healthy and temperate,  but begotten in a fit of intoxication, would be likely to suffer  permanently, both physically and mentally, from the condition which  the parents had temporarily brought upon themselves. On the other  hand, offspring begotten of parents in an unusually healthy and active  condition of body and mind, would likely be unusually endowed both  mentally and physically. The Arabs in breeding horses take advantage  of this fact, for before intercourse, both sire and dam are actively  exercised, not to weariness, but sufficiently to induce the most  vigorous condition possible. Of this, too, we have proof in the  phenomenon sometimes observed by breeders, that a strong mental  impression made upon the female by a particular male, will give the  offspring a resemblance to him, even though she have no sexual  intercourse with him. Of this, Mr. Boswell in his prize essay  published in 1828, gives a remarkable instance. He says that Mr.  Mustard of Angus, one of the most intelligent breeders he had ever met  with, told him that one of his cows chanced to come into season while  pasturing on a field bounded by that of one of his neighbors, out of  which field an ox jumped and went with the cow until she was brought  home to the bull. The ox was white, with black spots, and horned. Mr.  Mustard had not a horned beast in his possession, nor one with any  white on it. Nevertheless, the produce of the following spring was a  black and white calf with horns.    The case of Jacob is often quoted in support of this view, and  although many believe some miraculous agency to have been exerted in  his case, and though he could say with truth, \"God hath taken away the  cattle of your father and given them to me,\" it seems, on the whole,  more probable, inasmuch as supernatural agency may never be presumed,  except where we know, or have good reason to believe, that natural  causes are insufficient, that God \"gave\" them, as he now gives to  some, riches or honors; that is to say, by virtue of the operation of  natural laws. If all who keep cattle would exercise a tithe of the  patriarch's shrewdness and sagacity in improving their stock, we  should see fewer ill-favored kine than at present.    The possibility of some effect being produced by a strong impression  at the time of conception, is not to be confounded with the popular  error that \"marks\" upon an infant[14] are due to a transient, although  strong impression upon the imagination of the mother at any period of  gestation, which is unsupported by facts and absurd; but there are  facts sufficient upon record to prove that _habitual_ mental  condition, and especially at an early stage of pregnancy, _may_ have  the effect to produce some bodily deformity, and should induce great  caution.

[11] The late M.A. Cuming, V.S., of New Brunswick, once remarked to the  writer, that it might be due to the fact that the nerves of the uterus,  which before the first impregnation were in a rudimentary state, were  developed under a specific influence from the semen of the first male,  and that they might retain so much of a peculiar style of development  as to impress upon future progeny by other males the likeness of the  first.    [12] Edinburgh Journal Medical Science, 1849.    [13] A very striking fact may be related in this connection, which  while it may or may not have a practical bearing on the breeding of  domestic animals, shows forcibly how mysterious are some of the laws of  reproduction. It is stated by the celebrated traveler, Count de  Strzelecki, in his Physical Description of New South Wales and Van  Dieman's Land. \"Whenever,\" he says, \"a fruitful intercourse has taken  place between an aboriginal woman and an European male, that aboriginal  woman is forever after incapable of being impregnated by a male of her  own nation, although she may again be fertile with a European.\" The  Count, whose means and powers of observation are of the highest  possible order, affirms that \"hundreds of instances of this  extraordinary fact are on record in the writer's memoranda all  recurring invariably under the same circumstances, all tending to prove  that the sterility of the female, which is relative only to one and not  to the other male is not accidental, but follows laws as cogent though  as mysterious as the rest of those connected with generation.\" The  Count's statement is endorsed by Dr. Maunsell of Dublin, Dr. Carmichael  of Edinburgh, and the late Prof. Goodsir, who say they have learned  from independent sources that as regards Australia, Strzelecki's  statement is unquestionable and must be regarded as the expression of a  law of nature. The law does not extend to the negro race, the fertility  of the negro female not being apparently impaired by previous fruitful  intercourse with a European male.    In reply to an inquiry made whether he had ever noticed exceptional  cases, the Count says: \"It has not come under my cognizance to see or  hear of a native female which having a child with a European had  afterwards any offspring with a male of her own race.\"    The Count's statement is suggestive as to the disappearance of the  aborigines of some countries. This has often been the subject of severe  comment and is generally ascribed to the rum and diseases introduced by  the white man. It would now appear that other influences have also been  operative.    [14] Carpenter's Physiology, new edition, page 783.          CHAPTER IV.    ATAVISM, OR ANCESTRAL INFLUENCE.      It may not be easy to say whether this phenomenon is more connected  with the law of similarity, or with that of variation. Youatt, in his  work on cattle published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful  Knowledge, inclines to the former. He speaks of it as showing the  universality of the application of the axiom that \"like produces  like\"--that when this \"may not seem to hold good, it is often because  the lost resemblance to generations gone by is strongly revived.\" The  phenomenon, or law, as it is sometimes called, of atavism,[15] or  ancestral influence, is one of considerable practical importance, and  well deserves careful attention by the breeder of farm stock.    Every one is aware that it is nothing unusual for a child to resemble  its grandfather or grandmother or some ancestor still farther back,  more than it does either its own father or mother. The fact is too  familiar to require the citing of examples. We find the same  occurrence among our domestic animals, and oftener in proportion as  the breeds are crossed or mixed up. Among our common stock of neat  cattle, (_natives_, as they are often called,) originating as they  have done from animals brought from England, Scotland, Denmark, France  and Spain, each possessing different characteristics of form, color  and use; and bred, as our common stock has usually been,  indiscriminately together, with no special point in view, no attempt  to obtain any particular type or form, or to secure adaptation for any  particular purpose, we have very frequent opportunities of witnessing  the results of the operation of this law of hereditary transmission.  So common indeed is its occurrence, that the remark is often made,  that however good a cow may be, there is no telling beforehand what  sort of a calf she may have.    The fact is sufficiently obvious that certain peculiarities often lie  dormant for a generation or two and then reappear in subsequent  progeny. Stockmen often speak of it as \"breeding back,\" or \"crying  back.\" The cause of this phenomenon we may not fully understand. A  late writer says, \"it is to be explained on the supposition that the  qualities were transmitted by the grandfather to the father in whom  they were _masked_ by the presence of some antagonistic or controlling  influence, and were thence transmitted to the son in whom the  antagonistic influence being withdrawn they manifest themselves.\" A  French writer on Physiology says, if there is not inheritance of  paternal characteristics, there is at least an _aptitude_ to inherit  them, a disposition to reproduce them; and there is always a  transmission of this aptitude to some new descendants, among whom  these traits will manifest themselves sooner or later.[16] Mr. Singer,  let us say, has a remarkable aptitude for music; but the influence of  Mrs. Singer is such that their children inheriting her imperfect ear,  manifest no musical talent whatever. These children however have  inherited the disposition of the father in spite of its  non-manifestation; and if, "]]]
