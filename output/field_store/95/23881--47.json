Arthur Young, in the height of the agitations of the  Constituent Assembly, found himself at Moulins, the capital of the  Bourbonnais, and on the great post-road to Italy. He went to the best  coffee-house in the town, and found as many as twenty tables spread for  company, but as for a newspaper, he says he might as well have asked for  an elephant. In the capital of a great province, the seat of an  intendant, at a moment like that, with a National Assembly voting a  revolution, and not a newspaper to tell the people whether Fayette,  Mirabeau, or Lewis XVI. were on the throne! Could such a people as this,  he cries, ever have made a revolution or become free? 'Never in a  thousand centuries: the enlightened mob of Paris have done the whole.'  And that was the plain truth. What was involved in such a truth, we  shall see presently.    Robespierre had now risen to be one of the foremost men in France. To  borrow the figure of an older chief of French faction, from trifling  among the violins in the orchestra, he had ascended to the stage itself,  and had a right to perform leading parts. Disqualified for sitting in  the Assembly, he wielded greater power than ever in the Club. The  Constituent had been full of his enemies. 'Alone with my own soul,' he  once cried to the Jacobins, 'how could I have borne struggles that were  beyond any human strength, if I had not raised my spirit to God?' This  isolation marked him with a kind of theocratic distinction. These  communings with the unseen powers gave a certain indefinable prerogative  to a man, even among the children of the century of Voltaire. Condorcet,  the youngest of the intimates and disciples of Voltaire, of D'Alembert,  of Turgot, was the first to sound bitter warning that Robespierre was at  heart a priest. The suggestion was more than a gibe. Robespierre had the  typic sacerdotal temperament, its sense of personal importance, its thin  unction, its private leanings to the stake and the cord; and he had one  of those deplorable natures that seem as if they had never in their  lives known the careless joys of a springtime. By and by, from mere  priest he developed into the deadlier carnivore, the Inquisitor.    The absence of advantages of bodily presence has never been fatal to the  pretensions of the pontiff. Robespierre was only a couple of inches  above five feet in height, but the Grand Monarch himself was hardly  more. His eyes were small and weak, and he usually wore spectacles; his  face was pitted by the marks of small-pox; his complexion was dull and  sometimes livid; the tones of his voice were dry and shrill; and he  spoke with the vulgar accent of his province. Such is the accepted  tradition, and there is no reason to dissent from it. It is fair,  however, to remember that Robespierre's enemies had command of his  historic reputation at its source, and this is always a great advantage  for faction, if not for truth. So Robespierre's voice and person may  have been maligned, just as Aristophanes may have been a calumniator  when he accused Cleon of having an intolerably loud voice and smelling  of the tanyard. What is certain is that Robespierre was a master of  effective oratory adapted for a violent popular audience, to impress, to  persuade, and to command. The Convention would have yawned, if it had  not trembled under him, but the Jacobin Club never found him tedious.  Robespierre's style had no richness either of feeling or of phrase; no  fervid originality, no happy violences. If we turn from a page of  Rousseau to a page of Robespierre, we feel that the disciple has none of  the thrilling sonorousness of the master; the glow and the ardour have  become metallic; the long-drawn plangency is parodied by shrill notes of  splenetic complaint. The rhythm has no broad wings; the phrases have no  quality of radiance; the oratorical glimpses never lift the spirit into  new worlds. We are never conscious of those great pulses of strong  emotion that shake and vibrate through the nobly-measured periods of  Cicero or Bossuet or Burke. Robespierre could not rival the vivid and  highly-coloured declamation of Vergniaud; his speeches were never heated  with the ardent passion that poured like a torrent of fire through some  of the orations of Isnard; nor, above all, had he any mastery of that  dialect of the Titans, by which Danton convulsed an audience with fear,  with amazement, or with the spirit of defiant endeavour. The absence of  these intenser qualities did not make Robespierre's speeches less  effective for their own purpose. On the contrary, when the air has  become torrid, and passionate utterance is cheap, then severity in form  is very likely to pass for good sense in substance. That Robespierre had  decent fluency, copiousness, and finish, need hardly be said. The French  have an artistic sense; they have never accepted our own whimsical  doctrine, that a man's politics must be sagacious, if his speaking is  only clumsy enough. Robespierre more than once showed himself ready with  a forcible reply on critical occasions: this only makes him an  illustration the more of the good oratorical rule, that he is most  likely to come well out of the emergency of an improvisation, who is  usually most careful to prepare. Robespierre was as solicitous about the  correctness of his speech, as he was about the neatness of his clothes;  he no more grudged the pains given to the polishing of his discourses  than he grudged the time given every day to the powdering of his hair.    Nothing was more remarkable than his dexterity in presenting his case.  James Mill used to point out to his son among other skilful arts of  Demosthenes, these two: first, that he said everything important to his  purpose at the exact moment when he had brought the minds of his hearers  into the state most fitted to receive it; second, that he insinuated  gradually and indirectly into their minds ideas which would have roused  opposition if they had been expressed more directly. Mr. Mill once  called the attention of the present writer to exactly the same kind of  rhetorical skill in the speeches of Robespierre. The reader may do well  to turn, for excellent specimens of this, to the speech of January 11,  1792, against the war, or that of May 1794 against atheism. The logic is  stringent, but the premises are arbitrary. Robespierre is as one who  should iterate indisputable propositions of abstract geometry and  mechanics, while men are craving an architect who shall bridge the gulf  of waters. Exuberance of high words no longer conceals the sterility of  his ideas and the shallowness of his method. We should say of his  speeches, as of so much of the speaking and writing of the time, that it  is transparent and smooth, but there is none of that quality which the  critics of painting call Texture.    His listeners, however, in the old refectory of the Convent of the  Jacobins took little heed of these things; the matter was too absorbing,  the issue too vital. A hundred years before, the hunted Covenanters of  the Western Lowlands, with Claverhouse's dragoons a few miles off,  exulted in the endless exhortations and expositions of their hill  preachers: they relished nothing so keenly as three hours of  Mucklewrath, followed by three hours more of Peter Poundtext. We now  find the jargon of the Mucklewraths and the Poundtexts of the Solemn  League and Covenant, dead as it is, still not devoid of the picturesque  and the impressive. If we cannot say the same of the great preacher of  the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the reason is partly that time has  not yet softened the tones, and partly that there is no one in all the  world with whom it is so difficult to sympathise, as with the narrower  fanatics of our own particular faith.    We have still to mark the trait that above everything else gave to  Robespierre the trust and confidence of Paris. As men listened to him,  they had full faith in the integrity of the speaker. And Robespierre in  one way deserved this confidence. He was eminently the possessor of a  conscience. When the strain of circumstance in the last few months of  his life pressed him towards wrong, at least before doing wrong he was  forced to lie to his own conscience. This is a kind of honesty, as the  world goes. In the Salon of 1791 an artist exhibited Robespierre's  portrait, simply inscribing it, _The Incorruptible_. Throngs passed  before it every day, and ratified the honourable designation by eager  murmurs of approval. The democratic journals were loud in panegyric on  the unsleeping sentinel of liberty. They loved to speak of him as the  modern Fabricius, and delighted to recall the words of Pyrrhus, that it  is easier to turn the sun from its course, than to turn Fabricius from  the path of honour. Patriotic parents eagerly besought him to be sponsor  for their children. Ladies of wealth, including at least one  countrywoman of our own, vainly entreated him to accept their purses,  for women are quick to recognise the temperament of the priest, and  recognising they adore. A rich widow of Nantes besought him with  pertinacious tenderness to accept not only her purse but her hand.  Mirabeau's sister hailed him as an eagle floating through the blue  heavens.    Robespierre's life was frugal and simple, as must always be seemly in  the spokesman of the dumb multitude whose lives are very hard. He had a  single room in the house of Duplay, at the extreme west end of the long  Rue Saint Honore, half a mile from the Jacobin Club, and less than that  from the Riding School of the Tuileries, where the Constituent and  Legislative Assemblies held session. His room, which served him for  bed-chamber as well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1," back.\"    [Illustration]    His wife wept bitterly at the thought of leaving their children to  perish in the forest; but she, too, thought it better than to see them  die before her eyes. So she consented to her husband's plan.    But all this time Tom Thumb had been awake, and he had overheard all  the conversation. He lay awake a long while thinking what to do. Then,  slipping quietly out of bed, he ran down to the river and filled his  pocket with small white pebbles from the river's brink.    In the morning the parents called the children, and, after giving them a  crust of bread, they all set out for the wood. Tom Thumb did not say a  word to his brothers of what he had overheard; but, lingering behind, he  dropped the pebbles from his pocket one by one, as they walked, so that  he should be able to find his way home. When they reached a very thick  part of the forest, the father and mother told the children to wait  while they went a little farther to cut wood, but as soon as they were  out of sight they turned and went home by another way.    When darkness fell, the children began to realize that they were  deserted, and they began to cry loudly. Tom Thumb, however, did not cry.    \"Do not weep, my brothers,\" he said encouragingly. \"Only wait until the  moon rises, and we shall soon be able to find our way home.\"    When at length the moon rose, it shone down upon the white pebbles  which Tom Thumb had scattered; and, following this path, the children  soon reached their father's house.    But at first they were afraid to go in, and waited outside the door to  hear what their parents were talking about.    [Illustration]    Now, it happened that when the father and mother reached home, they  found a rich gentleman had sent them ten crowns, in payment for work  which had been done long before. The wife went out at once and bought  bread and meat, and she and her husband sat down to make a hearty meal.  But the mother could not forget her little ones; and at last she cried  to her husband:    \"Alas! where are our poor children? How they would have enjoyed this  good feast!\"    The children, listening at the door, heard this and cried out, \"Here we  are, mother; here we are!\" and, overjoyed, the mother flew to let them  in and kissed them all round.    Their parents were delighted to have their little ones with them again;  but soon the ten crowns were spent, and they found themselves as badly  off as before. Once more they agreed to leave the children in the  forest, and once again Tom Thumb overheard them. This time he did not  trouble himself very much; he thought it would be easy for him to do as  he had done before. He got up very early the next morning to go and get  the pebbles; but, to his dismay, he found the house door securely  locked. Then, indeed, he did not know what to do, and for a little while  he was in great distress. However, at breakfast the mother gave each of  the children a slice of bread, and Tom Thumb thought he would manage to  make his piece of bread do as well as the pebbles, by breaking it up and  dropping the crumbs as he went.    This time the father and mother took the children still deeper and  farther into the wood, and then, slipping away, left them alone.    Tom Thumb consoled his brothers as before; but when he came to look for  the crumbs of bread, not one of them was left. The birds had eaten them  all up, and the poor children were lost in the forest, with no possible  means of finding their way home.    [Illustration]    Tom Thumb did not lose courage. He climbed to the top of a high tree and  looked round to see if there was any way of getting help. In the  distance he saw a light burning, and, coming down from the tree, he led  his brothers toward the house from which it came.    When they knocked at the door, it was opened by a pleasant-looking  woman, and Tom Thumb told her they were poor children who had lost their  road, and begged her to give them a night's shelter.    \"Alas, my poor children!\" said the woman, \"you do not know where you  have come to. This is the house of an ogre who eats up little boys and  girls.\"    \"But, madam,\" replied Tom Thumb, \"what shall we do? If we go back to the  forest we are certain to be torn to pieces by the wolves. We had better,  I think, stay and be eaten by the ogre.\"    The ogre's wife had pity on the little things, and she thought she would  be able to hide them from her husband for one night. She took them in,  gave them food, and let them warm themselves by the fire.    Very soon there came a loud knocking at the door. It was the ogre come  home. His wife hid the children under the bed, and then hurried to let  her husband in.    No sooner had the ogre entered than he began to sniff this way and  that. \"I smell flesh,\" he said, looking round the room.    \"It must be the calf which has just been killed,\" said his wife.    \"I smell child's flesh, I tell you!\" cried the ogre, and he suddenly  made a dive under the bed, and drew out the children one by one.    [Illustration]    \"Oh, ho, madam!\" said he; \"so you thought to cheat me, did you? But,  really, this is very lucky! I have invited three ogres to dinner  to-morrow; these brats will make a nice dish.\"    He fetched a huge knife and began sharpening it, while the poor boys  fell on their knees and begged for mercy. But their prayers and  entreaties were useless. The ogre seized one of the children and was  just about to kill him, when his wife said--    \"What in the world makes you take the trouble of killing them to-night?  Why don't you leave them till the morning? There will be plenty of time,  and they will be much fresher.\"    \"That is very true,\" said the ogre, throwing down the knife. \"Give them  a good supper, so that they may not get lean, and send them to bed.\"    [Illustration]    Now, the ogre had seven young daughters, who were all about the same age  as Tom Thumb and his brothers. These young ogresses all slept together  in one large bed, and every one of them had a crown of gold on her head.  There was another bed of the same size in the room, and in this the  ogre's wife, having provided them all with nightcaps, put the seven  little boys.    [Illustration]    But Tom Thumb was afraid that the ogre might change his mind in the  night, and kill him and his brothers while they were asleep. So he crept  softly out of bed, took off his brothers' nightcaps and his own, and  stole over to the bed where the young ogresses lay. He drew off their  crowns very gently, and put the nightcaps on their heads instead. Then  he put the crowns on his brothers' heads and his own, and got into bed  again.    [Illustration]    In the middle of the night the ogre woke up, and began to be sorry that  he had put off killing the boys until the morning.    \"Never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day,\" he said; and,  jumping out of bed, he got his knife and walked stealthily to the room  where the boys were. He walked up to the bed, and they were all asleep  except Tom Thumb, who, however, kept his eyes fast shut, and did not  show that he was awake. The ogre touched their heads, one after another,  and feeling the crowns of gold, he said to himself:    \"What a mistake I was going to make!\" He then went to bed where his own  daughters were sleeping, and, feeling the nightcaps, he said:    \"Oh, ho, here you are, my lads!\" and in a moment he had killed them all.  He then went back to his own room to sleep till morning.    [Illustration]    As soon as Tom Thumb heard him snoring, he roused his brothers, and told  them to dress quickly and follow him. He led them downstairs and out of  the house; and then, stealing on tiptoe through the garden, they jumped  down from the wall into the road and ran swiftly away.    In the morning, when the ogre found what a dreadful thing he had done,  he was terribly shocked.    \"Fetch me my seven-league boots,\" he cried to his wife. \"I will go and  catch those young vipers. They shall pay for this piece of work!\" And,  drawing on the magic boots, the ogre set out.    [Illustration]    He went striding over the country, stepping from mountain to mountain,  and crossing rivers as if they had been streams. The poor children  watched him coming in fear and trembling. They had found the way to  their father's home, and had very nearly reached it when they saw the  ogre racing after them.    Tom Thumb thought for a moment what was to be done. Then he saw a hollow  place under a large rock.    \"Get in there,\" he said to his brothers.    When they were all in he crept in himself, but kept his eyes fixed on  the ogre, to see what he would do.    [Illustration]    The ogre, seeing nothing of the children, sat down to rest himself on  the very rock under which the poor boys were hiding. He was tired with  his journey, and soon fell fast asleep, and began to snore so loudly  that the little fellows were terrified. Tom Thumb told his brothers to  creep out softly and run home; which they did. Then he crept up to the  ogre, pulled off the seven-league boots very gently and put them on his  own feet, for being fairy boots they could fit themselves to any foot,  however small.    As soon as Tom Thumb had put on the ogre's seven-league boots, he took  ten steps to the Palace, which was seventy miles off, and asked to see  the King. He offered to carry news to the King's army, which was then a  long way off; and so useful was he with his magic boots, that in a short  time he had made money enough to keep himself, his father, his mother  and his six brothers without the trouble of working for the rest of  their lives.    And now let us see what has become of the wicked ogre, whom we left  sleeping on the rock.    When he awoke he missed his seven-league boots, and set off for home  very angry.    On his way he had to cross a bog; and, forgetting that he was no longer  wearing his magic boots, he tried to cross it with one stride. But,  instead, he put"]]]
