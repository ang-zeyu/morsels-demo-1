Grandmammy had indeed gone, and was now far away, \"clean\" out of  sight. I need not tell all that happened now. Almost heart-broken at the  discovery, I fell upon the ground, and{38} wept a boy's bitter tears,  refusing to be comforted. My brother and sisters came around me, and  said, \"Don't cry,\" and gave me peaches and pears, but I flung them away,  and refused all their kindly advances. I had never been deceived before;  and I felt not only grieved at parting--as I supposed forever--with my  grandmother, but indignant that a trick had been played upon me in a  matter so serious.    It was now late in the afternoon. The day had been an exciting and  wearisome one, and I knew not how or where, but I suppose I sobbed  myself to sleep. There is a healing in the angel wing of sleep, even for  the slave-boy; and its balm was never more welcome to any wounded soul  than it was to mine, the first night I spent at the domicile of old  master. The reader may be surprised that I narrate so minutely an  incident apparently so trivial, and which must have occurred when I was  not more than seven years old; but as I wish to give a faithful history  of my experience in slavery, I cannot withhold a circumstance which, at  the time, affected me so deeply. Besides, this was, in fact, my first  introduction to the realities of slavery.          CHAPTER III. _Parentage_    MY FATHER SHROUDED IN MYSTERY--MY MOTHER--HER PERSONAL  APPEARANCE--INTERFERENCE OF SLAVERY WITH THE NATURAL AFFECTIONS OF  MOTHER AND CHILDREN--SITUATION OF MY MOTHER--HER NIGHTLY VISITS TO HER  BOY--STRIKING INCIDENT--HER DEATH--HER PLACE OF BURIAL.      If the reader will now be kind enough to allow me time to grow bigger,  and afford me an opportunity for my experience to become greater, I will  tell him something, by-and-by, of slave life, as I saw, felt, and heard  it, on Col. Edward Lloyd's plantation, and at the house of old master,  where I had now, despite of myself, most suddenly, but not unexpectedly,  been dropped. Meanwhile, I will redeem my promise to say something more  of my dear mother.    I say nothing of _father_, for he is shrouded in a mystery I have never  been able to penetrate. Slavery does away with fathers, as it does away  with families. Slavery has no use for either fathers or families, and  its laws do not recognize their existence in the social arrangements  of the plantation. When they _do_ exist, they are not the outgrowths of  slavery, but are antagonistic to that system. The order of civilization  is reversed here. The name of the child is not expected to be that of  its father, and his condition does not necessarily affect that of the  child. He may be the slave of Mr. Tilgman; and his child, when born, may  be the slave of Mr. Gross. He may be a _freeman;_ and yet his child  may be a _chattel_. He may be white, glorying in the purity of his  Anglo-Saxon{40} blood; and his child may be ranked with the blackest  slaves. Indeed, he _may_ be, and often _is_, master and father to the  same child. He can be father without being a husband, and may sell his  child without incurring reproach, if the child be by a woman in whose  veins courses one thirty-second part of African blood. My father was a  white man, or nearly white. It was sometimes whispered that my master  was my father.    But to return, or rather, to begin. My knowledge of my mother is very  scanty, but very distinct. Her personal appearance and bearing  are ineffaceably stamped upon my memory. She was tall, and finely  proportioned; of deep black, glossy complexion; had regular features,  and, among the other slaves, was remarkably sedate in her manners. There  is in _Prichard's Natural History of Man_, the head of a figure--on page  157--the features of which so resemble those of my mother, that I  often recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose others  experience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones.    Yet I cannot say that I was very deeply attached to my mother; certainly  not so deeply as I should have been had our relations in childhood been  different. We were separated, according to the common custom, when I  was but an infant, and, of course, before I knew my mother from any one  else.    The germs of affection with which the Almighty, in his wisdom and mercy,  arms the hopeless infant against the ills and vicissitudes of his lot,  had been directed in their growth toward that loving old grandmother,  whose gentle hand and kind deportment it was in the first effort of my  infantile understanding to comprehend and appreciate. Accordingly,  the tenderest affection which a beneficent Father allows, as a partial  compensation to the mother for the pains and lacerations of her heart,  incident to the maternal relation, was, in my case, diverted from its  true and natural object, by the envious, greedy, and treacherous hand of  slavery. The slave-mother can be spared long enough from{41 MY MOTHER}  the field to endure all the bitterness of a mother's anguish, when it  adds another name to a master's ledger, but _not_ long enough to receive  the joyous reward afforded by the intelligent smiles of her child. I  never think of this terrible interference of slavery with my infantile  affections, and its diverting them from their natural course, without  feelings to which I can give no adequate expression.    I do not remember to have seen my mother at my grandmother's at  any time. I remember her only in her visits to me at Col. Lloyd's  plantation, and in the kitchen of my old master. Her visits to me there  were few in number, brief in duration, and mostly made in the night.  The pains she took, and the toil she endured, to see me, tells me that  a true mother's heart was hers, and that slavery had difficulty in  paralyzing it with unmotherly indifference.    My mother was hired out to a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles  from old master's, and, being a field hand, she seldom had leisure, by  day, for the performance of the journey. The nights and the distance  were both obstacles to her visits. She was obliged to walk, unless  chance flung into her way an opportunity to ride; and the latter was  sometimes her good luck. But she always had to walk one way or the  other. It was a greater luxury than slavery could afford, to allow a  black slave-mother a horse or a mule, upon which to travel twenty-four  miles, when she could walk the distance. Besides, it is deemed a foolish  whim for a slave-mother to manifest concern to see her children, and,  in one point of view, the case is made out--she can do nothing for them.  She has no control over them; the master is even more than the mother,  in all matters touching the fate of her child. Why, then, should  she give herself any concern? She has no responsibility. Such is the  reasoning, and such the practice. The iron rule of the plantation,  always passionately and violently enforced in that neighborhood, makes  flogging the penalty of{42} failing to be in the field before sunrise in  the morning, unless special permission be given to the absenting slave.  \"I went to see my child,\" is no excuse to the ear or heart of the  overseer.    One of the visits of my mother to me, while at Col. Lloyd's, I remember  very vividly, as affording a bright gleam of a mother's love, and the  earnestness of a mother's care.    \"I had on that day offended \"Aunt Katy,\" (called \"Aunt\" by way of  respect,) the cook of old master's establishment. I do not now remember  the nature of my offense in this instance, for my offenses were numerous  in that quarter, greatly depending, however, upon the mood of Aunt Katy,  as to their heinousness; but she had adopted, that day, her favorite  mode of punishing me, namely, making me go without food all day--that  is, from after breakfast. The first hour or two after dinner, I  succeeded pretty well in keeping up my spirits; but though I made  an excellent stand against the foe, and fought bravely during the  afternoon, I knew I must be conquered at last, unless I got the  accustomed reenforcement of a slice of corn bread, at sundown. Sundown  came, but _no bread_, and, in its stead, their came the threat, with a  scowl well suited to its terrible import, that she \"meant to _starve  the life out of me!\"_ Brandishing her knife, she chopped off the heavy  slices for the other children, and put the loaf away, muttering, all the  while, her savage designs upon myself. Against this disappointment, for  I was expecting that her heart would relent at last, I made an extra  effort to maintain my dignity; but when I saw all the other children  around me with merry and satisfied faces, I could stand it no longer. I  went out behind the house, and cried like a fine fellow! When tired of  this, I returned to the kitchen, sat by the fire, and brooded over my  hard lot. I was too hungry to sleep. While I sat in the corner, I caught  sight of an ear of Indian corn on an upper shelf of the kitchen. I  watched my chance, and got it, and, shelling off a few grains, I put  it back again. The grains in my hand, I quickly put in some ashes,  and covered them with embers, to roast them. All this I{43} did  at the risk of getting a brutual thumping, for Aunt Katy could beat, as  well as starve me. My corn was not long in roasting, and, with my keen  appetite, it did not matter even if the grains were not exactly done. I  eagerly pulled them out, and placed them on my stool, in a clever little  pile. Just as I began to help myself to my very dry meal, in came my  dear mother. And now, dear reader, a scene occurred which was altogether  worth beholding, and to me it was instructive as well as interesting.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#8)"],[1,"hurt.    Tarzan, following a natural impulse to aid his ally, leaped forward to  enter the dispute only to be checked by a grunted admonition from  Om-at. \"Back!\" he said. \"This fight is mine, alone.\"    The ape-man understood and stepped aside.    \"It is a gund-bar,\" explained Ta-den, \"a chief-battle. This fellow must  be Es-sat, the chief. If Om-at kills him without assistance Om-at may  become chief.\"    Tarzan smiled. It was the law of his own jungle--the law of the tribe  of Kerchak, the bull ape--the ancient law of primitive man that needed  but the refining influences of civilization to introduce the hired  dagger and the poison cup. Then his attention was drawn to the outer  edge of the vestibule. Above it appeared the shaggy face of one of  Es-sat's warriors. Tarzan sprang to intercept the man; but Ta-den was  there ahead of him.  \"Back!\" cried the Ho-don to the newcomer. \"It is  gund-bar.\" The fellow looked scrutinizingly at the two fighters, then  turned his face downward toward his fellows. \"Back!\" he cried, \"it is  gund-bar between Es-sat and Om-at.\" Then he looked back at Ta-den and  Tarzan. \"Who are you?\" he asked.    \"We are Om-at's friends,\" replied Ta-den.    The fellow nodded. \"We will attend to you later,\" he said and  disappeared below the edge of the recess.    The battle upon the ledge continued with unabated ferocity, Tarzan and  Ta-den having difficulty in keeping out of the way of the contestants  who tore and beat at each other with hands and feet and lashing tails.  Es-sat was unarmed--Pan-at-lee had seen to that--but at Om-at's side  swung a sheathed knife which he made no effort to draw. That would have  been contrary to their savage and primitive code for the chief-battle  must be fought with nature's weapons.    Sometimes they separated for an instant only to rush upon each other  again with all the ferocity and nearly the strength of mad bulls.  Presently one of them tripped the other but in that viselike embrace  one could not fall alone--Es-sat dragged Om-at with him, toppling upon  the brink of the niche. Even Tarzan held his breath. There they surged  to and fro perilously for a moment and then the inevitable  happened--the two, locked in murderous embrace, rolled over the edge  and disappeared from the ape-man's view.    Tarzan voiced a suppressed sigh for he had liked Om-at and then, with  Ta-den, approached the edge and looked over. Far below, in the dim  light of the coming dawn, two inert forms should be lying stark in  death; but, to Tarzan's amazement, such was far from the sight that met  his eyes. Instead, there were the two figures still vibrant with life  and still battling only a few feet below him. Clinging always to the  pegs with two holds--a hand and a foot, or a foot and a tail, they  seemed as much at home upon the perpendicular wall as upon the level  surface of the vestibule; but now their tactics were slightly altered,  for each seemed particularly bent upon dislodging his antagonist from  his holds and precipitating him to certain death below. It was soon  evident that Om-at, younger and with greater powers of endurance than  Es-sat, was gaining an advantage. Now was the chief almost wholly on  the defensive. Holding him by the cross belt with one mighty hand Om-at  was forcing his foeman straight out from the cliff, and with the other  hand and one foot was rapidly breaking first one of Es-sat's holds and  then another, alternating his efforts, or rather punctuating them, with  vicious blows to the pit of his adversary's stomach. Rapidly was Es-sat  weakening and with the knowledge of impending death there came, as  there comes to every coward and bully under similar circumstances, a  crumbling of the veneer of bravado which had long masqueraded as  courage and with it crumbled his code of ethics. Now was Es-sat no  longer chief of Kor-ul-JA--instead he was a whimpering craven battling  for life.  Clutching at Om-at, clutching at the nearest pegs he sought  any support that would save him from that awful fall, and as he strove  to push aside the hand of death, whose cold fingers he already felt  upon his heart, his tail sought Om-at's side and the handle of the  knife that hung there.    Tarzan saw and even as Es-sat drew the blade from its sheath he dropped  catlike to the pegs beside the battling men. Es-sat's tail had drawn  back for the cowardly fatal thrust. Now many others saw the perfidious  act and a great cry of rage and disgust arose from savage throats; but  as the blade sped toward its goal, the ape-man seized the hairy member  that wielded it, and at the same instant Om-at thrust the body of  Es-sat from him with such force that its weakened holds were broken and  it hurtled downward, a brief meteor of screaming fear, to death.        4    Tarzan-jad-guru    As Tarzan and Om-at clambered back to the vestibule of Pan-at-lee's  cave and took their stand beside Ta-den in readiness for whatever  eventuality might follow the death of Es-sat, the sun that topped the  eastern hills touched also the figure of a sleeper upon a distant,  thorn-covered steppe awakening him to another day of tireless tracking  along a faint and rapidly disappearing spoor.    For a time silence reigned in the Kor-ul-JA. The tribesmen waited,  looking now down upon the dead thing that had been their chief, now at  one another, and now at Om-at and the two who stood upon his either  side. Presently Om-at spoke. \"I am Om-at,\" he cried. \"Who will say that  Om-at is not gund of Kor-ul-JA?\"    He waited for a taker of his challenge. One or two of the larger young  bucks fidgeted restlessly and eyed him; but there was no reply.    \"Then Om-at is gund,\" he said with finality. \"Now tell me, where are  Pan-at-lee, her father, and her brothers?\"    An old warrior spoke. \"Pan-at-lee should be in her cave. Who should  know that better than you who are there now? Her father and her  brothers were sent to watch Kor-ul-lul; but neither of these questions  arouse any tumult in our breasts. There is one that does: Can Om-at be  chief of Kor-ul-JA and yet stand at bay against his own people with a  Ho-don and that terrible man at his side--that terrible man who has no  tail? Hand the strangers over to your people to be slain as is the way  of the Waz-don and then may Om-at be gund.\"    Neither Tarzan nor Ta-den spoke then, they but stood watching Om-at and  waiting for his decision, the ghost of a smile upon the lips of the  ape-man. Ta-den, at least, knew that the old warrior had spoken the  truth--the Waz-don entertain no strangers and take no prisoners of an  alien race.    Then spoke Om-at. \"Always there is change,\" he said. \"Even the old  hills of Pal-ul-don appear never twice alike--the brilliant sun, a  passing cloud, the moon, a mist, the changing seasons, the sharp  clearness following a storm; these things bring each a new change in  our hills. From birth to death, day by day, there is constant change in  each of us. Change, then, is one of Jad-ben-Otho's laws.    \"And now I, Om-at, your gund, bring another change. Strangers who are  brave men and good friends shall no longer be slain by the Waz-don of  Kor-ul-JA!\"    There were growls and murmurings and a restless moving among the  warriors as each eyed the others to see who would take the initiative  against Om-at, the iconoclast.    \"Cease your mutterings,\" admonished the new gund. \"I am your chief. My  word is your law. You had no part in making me chief.  Some of you  helped Es-sat to drive me from the cave of my ancestors; the rest of  you permitted it. I owe you nothing. Only these two, whom you would  have me kill, were loyal to me. I am gund and if there be any who  doubts it let him speak--he cannot die younger.\"    Tarzan was pleased. Here was a man after his own heart. He admired the  fearlessness of Om-at's challenge and he was a sufficiently good judge  of men to know that he had listened to no idle bluff--Om-at would back  up his words to the death, if necessary, and the chances were that he  would not be the one to die. Evidently the majority of the  Kor-ul-jaians entertained the same conviction.    \"I will make you a good gund,\" said Om-at, seeing that no one appeared  inclined to dispute his rights. \"Your wives and daughters will be  safe--they were not safe while Es-sat ruled.  Go now to your crops and  your hunting. I leave to search for Pan-at-lee. Ab-on will be gund  while I am away--look to him for guidance and to me for an accounting  when I return--and may Jad-ben-Otho smile upon you.\"    He turned toward Tarzan and the Ho-don. \"And you, my friends,\" he said,  \"are free to go among my people; the cave of my ancestors is yours, do  what you will.\"    \"I,\" said Tarzan, \"will go with Om-at to search for Pan-at-lee.\"    \"And I,\" said Ta-den.    Om-at smiled. \"Good!\" he exclaimed. \"And when we have found her we  shall go together upon Tarzan's business and Ta-den's. Where first  shall we search?\" He turned toward his warriors. \"Who knows where she  may be?\"    None knew other than that Pan-at-lee had gone to her cave with the  others the previous evening--there was no clew, no suggestion as to her  whereabouts.    \"Show me where she sleeps,\" said Tarzan; \"let me see something that  belongs to her--an article of her apparel--then, doubtless, I can help  you.\"    Two young warriors climbed closer to the ledge upon which Om-at stood.  They were In-sad and O-dan. It was the latter who spoke.    \"Gund of Kor-ul-JA,\" he said, \"we would go with you to search for  Pan-at-lee.\"    It was the first acknowledgment of Om-at's chieftainship and  immediately following it the tenseness that had prevailed seemed to  relax--the warriors spoke aloud instead of in whispers, and the women  appeared from the mouths of caves as with the passing of a sudden  storm. In-sad and O-dan had taken the lead and now all seemed glad to  follow. Some came to talk with Om-at and to look more closely at  Tarzan; others, heads of caves,"]]]
