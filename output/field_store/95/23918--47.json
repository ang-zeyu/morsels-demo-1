Surely not.\"  He started up and,  disregarding both hunger and fatigue, travelled forward, assured that  relief was at hand.    In a short time he overtook the two shepherds who had come with him from  Koomah.  They were greatly surprised to see him, observing that they  never doubted that the Foulahs had murdered him.  In their company he  arrived at Sibidooloo, the frontier town of the kingdom of Manding.  The  chief man in the place, called Mansa, received him most kindly, and when  Park related how he had been robbed of his horse and apparel, he  observed, with an indignant air, \"Sit down.  You shall have everything  restored to you--I have sworn it.\"  He at once gave directions to his  people to search for the robbers.  Park was conducted into a hut, where  he was provided with food, and a crowd of people assembled, all of whom  commiserated his misfortunes and vented imprecations against the  Foulahs.    As there was a great scarcity of provisions in the place, Park, after  spending two days there, begged Mansa to allow him to depart.  He gave  him permission to do so, provided he would remain at a town called Wanda  for a few days, until he received some account of his horse and goods.    He took his departure accordingly on the morning of the 28th, and  reached Wanda about noon of the 30th.    The head man of the place, who was a Mahommedan, acted not only as chief  magistrate, but as schoolmaster.  He kept his school in an open shed,  where the traveller was desired to take up his lodgings.  Park was very  anxious for his clothes, as those he had on were completely worn-out,  his shirt being like a piece of muslin and dirty in the extreme.    He here spent nine days suffering much from fever.  On the 6th two  people arrived from Sibidooloo, bringing his horse and clothes, but his  pocket compass, greatly to his vexation, was broken to pieces.    Every day he observed several women come to the house to receive a  certain quantity of corn.  Knowing how valuable this article was at the  present juncture, he enquired of his host whether he maintained these  poor women from pure bounty or expected a return when the harvest should  be gathered in.    \"Observe that boy,\" said he, pointing to a fine child about five years  of age.  \"His mother has sold him to me for forty days' provisions for  herself and the rest of her family.  I have bought another boy in the  same manner.\"    Sick as he was, Park thought it necessary to take his leave of his  hospitable landlord, to whom he presented his horse as the only  recompense he could make, desiring him to convey his saddle and bridle  as a present to Mansa of Sibidooloo.  As he was about to set out, his  host begged him to accept his spear as a token of remembrance and a  leather bag to contain his clothes.  Having converted his half-boots  into sandals, he travelled with more ease.    Although the people were suffering great distress from the failure of  the crops, he was in general most hospitably treated.  His landlord at  Kinyeto, observing that he had hurt his ankle, insisted on his remaining  several days till he could walk with the help of a staff.    Notwithstanding suffering from fever and exposed to constant rain, he  continued his journey, narrowly escaping being detained at the town of  Mansia by the inhospitable chief, who insisted on being paid for the  small amount of food he had provided.    On September 16th he reached the town of Kamalia.  He was here conducted  to the house of a Bushreen, Kafa Taura.  He was collecting a caravan of  slaves to convey to the European settlements on the Gambia, as soon as  the rains should be over.  He found Kafa seated in his house surrounded  by several _slatees_ who proposed joining the caravan.  He was reading  to them from an Arabic book, and enquired if his guest understood it.  On being answered in the negative, he desired one of the _slatees_ to  fetch a curious little book which had been brought from the west  country.  It proved to be a book of Common Prayer, and Kafa expressed  great joy on hearing that Park could read it, for some of the _slatees_,  observing the colour of his skin, now become yellow from sickness,  suspected that he was an Arab in disguise.  Kafa, however, had now no  doubt concerning him, and kindly promised him every assistance in his  power.    Park was here laid up completely by fever, but Kafa, who had provided a  quiet hut for his accomodation, advised him to remain within it,  assuring him that if he did not walk out in the wet he would soon be  well.    He passed five weeks in a gloomy and solitary manner, seldom visited by  any person except his benevolent landlord, who came daily to enquire  about his health.    When the rains became less frequent the country began to grow dry and  the fever left him, but in so debilitated condition that it was with  difficulty he could crawl with his mat to the shade of a tamarind tree  at a short distance, there to enjoy the refreshing smell of the  corn-fields.  The benevolent and simple manners of the negroes, and the  perusal of Kafa's little volume greatly contributed to his restoration.    In the beginning of December, Kafa began to make arrangements for his  journey, and to complete the purchase of his slaves.    As he had to be absent about his affairs for a month, Park was left  during the time to the care of a good old Bushreen, who acted as  schoolmaster to the younger people of Kamalia.    The long-wished-for day of the departure of the caravan, the 19th of  April, at length arrived, and the irons being removed from the slaves,  the _slatees_ assembled at the door of Kafa's house, where the bundles  were all tied up, and everyone had his load assigned him.    Kafa had twenty-seven slaves for sale, but eight others afterwards  joined them, making in all thirty-five.  The schoolmaster who was on his  return to Woradoo, the place of his nativity, took with him eight of his  scholars.  Altogether, the come numbered seventy-three persons.    The caravan was followed for about half a mile by most of the  inhabitants of Kamalia; and when they had arrived at the top of a hill,  from whence they had a view of the town, they were all ordered to sit  down--those belonging to the coffle with their faces towards the west,  and the townspeople with theirs towards Kamalia.  The schoolmaster, with  two of the principal _slatees_, having taken their places between the  two parties, pronounced a solemn prayer, after which they walked three  times round the coffle, making impressions in the ground with the ends  of their spears, and muttering something by way of a charm.  When this  ceremony was ended, all the people belonging to the coffle sprang up  and, without taking a formal farewell of their friends, set forward.    Another ceremony was performed when the party stopped to dine on the  road.  Before commencing the meal, when each person was seated with  their quotas arranged before him in small gourd shells, the schoolmaster  offered up a short prayer that God and the holy prophet might preserve  them from robbers and all bad people, that their provisions might never  fail nor their limbs become fatigued.    After stopping at the town of Kenytakooro till the 22nd of April, the  coffle commenced the journey through the Jallonka wilderness.  The  country was very beautiful and abounded with birds and deer; but so  anxious were they to push on, that they made fully thirty miles that  day.  Fatigued as they were, they were frequently disturbed in the night  by the howling of wild beasts and the bites of ants.    On setting out in the morning Nealee, one of Kafa's female slaves  refused to drink the gruel offered her.  The country was extremely wild  and rocky, and Park began to fear that he should be unable to keep up  with the party.  Others, however, suffered more than he did.  The poor  female slave began to lag behind; and, complaining dreadfully of pains  in her legs, her load was taken from her and given to another, and she  was ordered to keep in front of the coffle.    As the party were resting near a rivulet a hive of bees was discovered  in a hollow tree, and some of the people were proceeding to obtain the  honey, when an enormous swarm flew out, and, attacking every one, made  them fly in every direction.  Park being the first to take alarm, was  the only person who escaped with impunity.  The slaves had, however,  left their bundles behind them, and to obtain them it was necessary to  set the grass on fire to the east of the hive, when the wind driving the  flames along, the men pushed through the smoke and recovered their  bundles.  They also brought with them poor Nealee, whom they found lying  by the rivulet stung in the most dreadful manner.  On her refusing to  proceed further, she was cruelly beaten with a whip, when, suddenly  starting up, she walked for four or five hours; she then made an attempt  to run away, but, from weakness, fell to the ground.  Though unable to  rise, the whip was a second time applied, when Kafa ordered that she  should be placed on an ass.  Unable to sit on it, she was carried  afterwards on a litter by two slaves.    The unfortunate slaves, who had travelled all day in the hot sun with  loads on their heads, were dreadfully fatigued; and some of them began  to snap their fingers--a sure sign, among negroes, of desperation.  They  were, therefore, put in irons, and kept apart from each other.  Next day  poor Nealee was again placed on the ass; but unable to hold herself on,  frequently fell to the ground.  At length the cry arose  of--\"_Kang-tegi_!\"  (\"Cut her throat!\") As Park did not wish to see this  horrible operation performed, he went on ahead; but soon afterwards he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21400"],[0,"Style in Singing (#8)"],[1,"were written. Those who  accuse artists of introducing changes, of not performing the music as  the composer wrote it, should be quite sure as to what the composer  really did write, since many changes are made both before and after  the work is printed. They should also be certain that these changes  are not such as the composer may have, or would have, sanctioned,  seeing that by their use his meaning is more clearly expressed.    At the _Concerts Spirituels_, given at the Church of the Sorbonne,  Paris, may be heard very excellent performances of Oratorio by ancient  and modern composers, from Handel and Bach to Claude Debussy; though I  do not know whether or no _l'Enfant prodigue_ (The Prodigal Son), by  Debussy, is properly styled an oratorio, seeing that it was recently  given in London on the stage as an opera. These performances at the  Sorbonne are marked by a reverential attention to detail; the  soloists, chorus and orchestra being very competent, and the  conductor--M. Paul de Saunieres--a musician of ability and experience.  In spite of these great advantages, however, the works of several of  the old classic composers suffer somewhat, by certain authentic  traditions and conventions being either unknown or ignored. To cite  only one instance out of many: At the Sorbonne, the opening bars of  the second movement of the Recit. in _The Messiah_, \"Comfort ye my  people,\" etc., are performed as printed:    [Music: The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness]    This music is written in the Italian \"manner,\" consequently its  performance should be in conformity with the usages and conventions  which obtained when the work was composed. One of these, as I have  pointed out, was the substitution of one note for another in certain  places; another, that in declamatory recitative, or _recitativo  parlante_, the chord in the orchestra should come _after_ the voice  (\"_dopo la parola_\"). These words appear in many scores of the Italian  operas, even of the present day. But when they do not, the musical  director is supposed to be familiar with the custom. The following,  therefore, is the authentic mode of performing the passage in  question:    [Music: The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness]    Apart from these defects in the rendering of the ancient classics, it  would be unjust not to acknowledge the great artistic merit and value  of the performances, given--as Oratorio should be--in the church. To  hear _l'Enfance du Christ_ (Berlioz) as performed at the Sorbonne,  with its particular facilities for obtaining the _ppp_ effects of the  distant or receding angelic chorus, is to be impressed to a degree  impossible of attainment in the concert-room.    Let those purists who resent any \"tampering\"--as they term it--with  the composers' music listen to the following phrase, sung as it is  printed in the ordinary editions:    [Music: the first-fruits _of_ them that sleep.]    Then let them hear it given according to the authentic and accepted  tradition, and say which of the two versions most faithfully  interprets the composer's meaning.    [Music: the first-fruits of _them_ that sleep.]           *       *       *       *       *    Let us now consider alterations which do not appear in the printed  editions, and yet may have been made or sanctioned by the composer.    In comparison with painting and sculpture, music and the literature of  the theatre are not self-sufficing arts. They require an interpreter.  Before a dramatic work can exist completely, scenery, and actors to  give it voice and gesture, are necessary; before music can be anything  more than hieroglyphics, the signs must be transmuted into sound by  singers or instrumentalists. Wagner embodied this truth in his  pathetic reference to _Lohengrin_: \"When ill, miserable and  despairing, I sat brooding over my fate, my eye fell on the score of  my _Lohengrin_, which I had totally forgotten. Suddenly I felt  something like compassion lest the music might never sound from off  the death-pale paper.\" In other words, _Lohengrin_, though finished in  every detail, was merely potential music. To make it anything more,  the aid of singers and orchestra are essential.    Composers and dramatic authors, in fact, _create_ their art-works; but  it is their interpreters--actors, singers, instrumentalists--who  _animate_ them, who breathe life into them. One of the inevitable  consequences is, that the composer's ideal can never be fully  attained.    But changes in performance from the printed text of a composition are  frequently the work of the composer himself. If really an artist, he  is rarely perfectly satisfied with his completed work. The difference  between his ideal and his materialization of it, is a source of  anguish for him. The journey made by a vision of art from the brain  that conceives it to the hand that imprisons it in marble, or depicts  it in colour, or pens it in words or music, is a long one. And much  grace or power, beauty or grandeur, is inevitably lost on the way.  This is the explanation of the disappointment of all true artists with  their creations. This is the origin of their endless strivings to  perfect their works; the first embodiment is not a perfect  interpretation of the artist's inspiration, and further reflection  has revealed to him an improvement. The process is endless.        _A man's reach should exceed his grasp,          Or what is Heaven for?_    If one wishes to surprise genius labouring to give birth to  perfection, one should consult the later editions of Victor Hugo's  works and note the countless emendations he made after their first  publication--here a more fitting word substituted, there a line  recast, elsewhere an entire verse added, or excised, or remodelled.    This work of incessant revision is not restricted to poets. Composers  of genius are also inveterate strivers after perfection, are  continually occupied in polishing and revising their music. And not  all the modifications they make, or sanction, are recorded in the  printed versions. For many are the outcome of after-thoughts, of ideas  suggested during the process of what I have called transmuting musical  hieroglyphics into sound. Such modifications, usually decided upon in  the course of a rehearsal--I am now considering particularly operatic  works--are frequently jotted down, a mere scanty memorandum, on the  singer's part or the conductor's score. But they are the work of the  composer, or have received his approval, and, although not noted in  the printed editions of his compositions, are transmitted orally from  conductor to conductor, singer to singer, master to pupil. And thus a  tradition is perpetuated.    But the question of changes goes even further.    Prior to the advent of Wagner, the singer was allowed great license  in operatic works. This license was principally manifested in a  two-fold form. The first is called _pointage_ (French), _puntatura_  (Italian), and means the changing of the notes or contour of a musical  phrase; the second is termed _changements_ or _variantes_ (Fr.),  _abbellimenti_ or _fioriture_ (It.), and refers to the interpolation  and addition of ornaments, _i.e._, embellishments and cadenzas.           *       *       *       *       *    POINTAGE    This, as I have said, is the technical term given to the modification  or rearrangement of the notes of a phrase, so as to bring it within  the natural capabilities of the artist singing the role. A few  illustrations will make the nature of _pointage_ clear.    In Rossini's _Guillaume Tell_, although it is written in a different  style from his former works, whence less necessity for interpolations  and modifications, occurs the following terrible passage for the  principal baritone:    [Music: Mais je connais le poids des fers, mais je connais le poids  des fers.]    Every vocalist knows the difficulty experienced in singing very high  tones to different syllables, each requiring a different conformation  of the buccal cavity. The passage quoted--expressing Tell's bitterness  at the recollection of his past sufferings in prison, \"Well I know the  weight of galling chain\"--has to be declaimed with great energy. So  far as the relative value of the notes is concerned, it is entirely  _ad libitum_, the rhythmical figure in the orchestra having ceased one  half-bar before. It is said that Dabadie, a _basso cantante_ rather  than baritone, to whom was entrusted the role of Tell on the first  production of the work at the Opera, Paris, on August 3, 1829, finding  it impossible to sing the phrase as written, had recourse to a  professor. He advised the _pointage_ given later. This change became  traditional, and has since been followed, except, it is said, in the  case of Massol, who succeeded Dabadie. He, being possessed of a very  sonorous voice of exceptional compass, was able to give the phrase as  written. This change, or _pointage_, must have been heard by Rossini,  and so must have been tacitly approved by him. This is the change made  by Dabadie:    [Music: Mais je connais le poids des fers, mais je connais le poids  des fers.]    In Italian lyric theatres, _pointage_ becomes necessary in many French  operas, owing to the prevalent custom of allotting to contraltos  certain roles written for soprano and known as \"dugazon roles\" (from  Madame Dugazon, who created the type). The parts of Siebel in _Faust_  (Gounod), Urbain in _Les Huguenots_, Stephane in _Romeo et Juliette_  (Gounod), are all written for soprano, and when sung in Italian  require not only transposition of the principal airs, but the use of  _pointage_ in passages where transposition is impossible owing, for  instance, to the participation of other characters in the scene. Thus  the air sung by the page Urbain (_Les Huguenots_) on his entrance is  sung in the French theatres as written by Meyerbeer, _i.e._, in _B_  flat. In theatres where the Italian version is"]]]
