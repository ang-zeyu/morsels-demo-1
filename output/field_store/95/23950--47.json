It is in the form of a  culverin--a long slender cannon of the period--standing upright. From  the muzzle rises a marble cross supporting the figure of Christ on one  side, and that of the Virgin on the other. It was erected by Charles  d'Anisson, prior of the French Antonians, to commemorate the  absolution given by Clement VIII. to Henry IV. of France and Navarre,  on September 17 of the year 1595. The monument has a remarkable  history. Although apparently erected by private enterprise, the kings  of France regarded it as an insult of the Curia, an official boast of  their submission to the Pope; and they lost no opportunity of showing  their dissatisfaction in consequence. Louis XIV. found an occasion for  revenge. The gendarmes who had escorted his ambassador, the duc de  Crequi, to Rome, had a street brawl with the Pope's Corsican  body-guards; and although it was doubtful which side was to blame,  Louis obliged Pope Alexander VII. to raise a pyramid on the spot where  the affray had taken place, with the following humiliating  inscription:--    \"In denunciation of the murderous attack committed by the Corsican  soldiers against his Excellency the duc de Crequi, Pope Alexander VII.  declares their nation deprived forever of the privilege of serving  under the flag of the Church. This monument was erected May 21, 1664,  according to the agreement made at Pisa.\"    The revenge could not have been more complete; so bitter was it that  Alexander VII. drew a violent protest against it, to be read and  published only after his death. His successor, Clement IX., a favorite  with Louis XIV., obtained leave that the pyramid should be demolished,  which was done in June, 1668, with the consent of the French  ambassador, the duc de Chaulnes. Whether by stipulation or by the good  will of the Pope, the inscription of the column of Henry IV. was made  to disappear at the same time. We have found it concealed in a remote  corner of the convent of S. Antonio.[25] The column itself, and the  canopy which sheltered it, fell to the ground on Thursday, February  15, 1744; and when Benedict XIV. restored the monument in the  following year, he severed forever its connection with these  remarkable historical events, by dedicating it DEIPARAE VIRGINI. Having  been dismantled in 1875, during the construction of the Esquiline  quarter, it was reerected in 1880, not far from its original place, on  the east side of S. Maria Maggiore,--not without opposition, because  there are always men who think they can obliterate history by  suppressing monuments which bear testimony to it.    One of the characteristics of ancient sanctuaries, by which the weary  pilgrim was provided with bathing accommodations, is also to be found  in the old churches of Rome. We are told in the \"Liber Pontificalis\"  that Pope Symmachus (498-514), while building the basilica of S.  Pancrazio, on the Via Aurelia, _fecit in eadem balneum_, \"provided it  with a bath.\" Another was erected by the same Pope near the apse of  S. Paolo fuori le Mura, the supply of water of which was originally  derived from a spring; later from wheels, or noriahs, established on  the banks of the Tiber. Notices were written on the walls of these  bathing apartments, warning laymen and priests to observe the  strictest rules of modesty. One of these inscriptions, from the baths  annexed to the churches of SS. Sylvester and Martin, is preserved in  section II. of the Christian epigraphic museum of the Lateran. It ends  with the distich:--    NON NOSTRIS NOCET OFFICIIS NEC CULPA LABACRI  QUOD SIBIMET GENERAT LUBRICA VITA MALUM EST,--    \"There is no harm in seeking strength and purity of body in baths; it  is not water but our own bad actions that make us sin.\" These verses  are not so good as their moral; but inscriptions like this prove that  the abandonment of such useful institutions must be attributed not to  the undue severity of Christian morality, but to the ruin of the  aqueducts by which fountains and baths were fed. However, even in the  darkest period of the Middle Ages we find the traditional \"kantharos,\"  or basin, in the centre of the quadri-porticoes or courts by which the  basilicas were entered. Such is the vase in the court of S. Caecilia,  represented on the next page, and that in front of S. Cosimato in  Trastevere; and such is the famous _calix marmoreus_, which formerly  stood near the church of SS. Apostoli, mentioned in the Bull of John  III. (A. D. 570), by which the boundary line of that parish was  determined. This historical monument, a prominent landmark in the  topography of mediaeval Rome, was removed to the Baths of Diocletian at  the beginning of last year.    In many of our churches visitors may have noticed one or more round  black stones, weighing from ten to a hundred pounds, which, according  to tradition, were tied to the necks of martyrs when they were thrown  into wells, lakes, or rivers. To the student these stones tell a  different tale. They prove that the classic institution of the  _ponderaria_ (sets of weights and measures) migrated from temples to  churches, after the closing of the former, A. D. 393.    [Illustration: Kantharos in the Court of St. Caecilia.]    As the _amphora_ was the standard measure of capacity for wine, the  _metreta_ for oil, the _modius_ for grain, so the _libra_ was the  standard measure of weight.[26] To insure honesty in trade they were  examined periodically by order of the aediles; those found _iniquae_  (short) were broken, and their owners sentenced to banishment in  remote islands. In A. D. 167, Junius Rusticus, prefect of the city,  ordered a general inspection to be made in Rome and in the provinces;  weights and measures found to be legal were marked or stamped with the  legend \"[Verified] by the authority of Q. Junius Rusticus, prefect of  the city.\" These weights of Rusticus are discovered in hundreds in  Roman excavations.[27]    The original standards were kept in the Temple of Jupiter on the  Capitol, and used only on extraordinary occasions. Official duplicates  were deposited in other temples, like those of Castor and Pollux, Mars  Ultor, Ops, and others, and kept at the disposal of the public, whence  their name of _pondera publica_. Barracks and market-places were also  furnished with them. The most important discovery connected with this  branch of Roman administration was made at Tivoli in 1883, when three  _mensae ponderariae_, almost perfect, were found in the portico or  peribolos of the Temple of Hercules, adjoining the cathedral of S.  Lorenzo. This wing of the portico is divided into compartments by  means of projecting pilasters, and each recess is occupied by a marble  table resting on \"trapezophoroi\" richly ornamented with symbols of  Hercules and Bacchus, like the club and the thyrsus. Along the edge of  two of the tables runs the inscription, \"Made at the expense of Marcus  Varenus Diphilus, president of the college of Hercules,\" while the  third was erected at the expense of his wife Varena. The tables are  perforated by holes of conical shape, varying in diameter from 200 to  380 millimetres. Brass measures of capacity were fastened into each  hole, for use by buyers and sellers. They were used in a very  ingenious way, both as dry and liquid measures. The person who had  bought, for instance, half a modius of beans, or twenty-four  _sextarii_ of wine, and wanted to ascertain whether he had been  cheated in his bargain, would fill the receptacle to the proper line,  then open the valve or spicket below, and transfer the tested contents  again to his sack or flask.    The institution was accepted by the Church, and _ponderaria_ were set  up in the principal basilicas. The best set which has come down to us  is that of S. Maria in Trastevere, but there is hardly a church  without a \"stone\" weighing from five or ten to a hundred pounds. The  popular superstition by which these practical objects were transformed  into relics of martyrdoms is very old. Topographers and pilgrims of  the seventh century speak of a stone exhibited in the chapel of SS.  Abundius and Irenaeus, under the portico of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura,  \"which, in their ignorance, pilgrims touch and lift.\" They mention  also another weight, exhibited in the church of S. Stephen, near S.  Paul's, which they believed to be one of the stones with which the  martyr was killed.    In 1864 a _schola_ (a memorial and banqueting hall) was discovered in  the burial grounds adjoining the praetorian camp, which had been used  by members of a corporation called the _sodalium serrensium_, that is,  of the citizens of Serrae, a city of Samothrake, I believe. Among the  objects pertaining to the hall and its customers were two measures for  wine, a _sextarium_, and a _hemina_, marked with the monogram of  Christ and the name of the donor.[28] They are now exhibited in the  _sala dei bronzi_ of the Capitoline museum.    The hall of the citizens of Serrae, discovered in 1864, belongs to a  class of monuments very common in the suburbs of Rome. They were  called _cellae, memoriae, exedrae_, and _scholae_, and were used by  relatives and friends of the persons buried under or near them, in the  performance of expiatory ceremonies or for commemorative banquets, for  which purpose all the necessaries, from the table-service to the  festal garments, were kept on the spot, in cabinets entrusted to the  care of a watchman. This practice--save the expiatory offerings--was  adopted by the Christians. The _agapai_, or love-feasts, before  degenerating into those excesses and superstitions so strongly  denounced by the Fathers of the Church, were celebrated over or near  the tombs of martyrs and confessors, the treasury of the local  congregation supplying food and drink, as well as the banqueting  robes.

The  values of _l_, _b_ are computed from ([alpha][delta]) with the help of  tables in preparation at the Lund Observatory, or from the original to  plate I at the end, allowing the conversion of the equatorial  coordinates into galactic ones. The values of [pi] are generally taken  from the table of KAPTEYN and WEERSMA mentioned in the previous chapter.  The values of [mu] are obtained from B. P. C., those of the radial  velocity (_W_) from the card catalogue in Lund already described.    There are in all, in the sky, 20 stars having an apparent magnitude  brighter than 1m.5. The brightest of them is _Sirius_, which, owing to  its brilliancy and position, is visible to the whole civilized world. It  has a spectrum of the type A0 and hence a colour-index nearly equal to  0.0 (observations in Harvard give _c_ = +0.06). Its apparent magnitude  is -1m.6, nearly the same as that of Mars in his opposition. Its  absolute magnitude is -0m.3, _i.e._, fainter than the apparent  magnitude, from which we may conclude that it has a distance from us  smaller than one siriometer. We find, indeed, from the eighth column  that _r_ = 0.5 sir. The proper motion of Sirius is 1\".32 per year, which  is rather large but still not among the largest proper motions as will  be seen below. From the 11th column we find that Sirius is moving  towards us with a velocity of 1.6 sir./st. (= 7.6 km./sec.), a rather  small velocity. The third column shows that its right ascension is 6h  40m and its declination -16 deg.. It lies in the square GD_7 and its  galactic coordinates are seen in the 5th and 6th columns.    The next brightest star is _Canopus_ or [alpha] Carinae at the south sky.  If we might place absolute confidence in the value of _M_ (= -8.2) in  the 12th column this star would be, in reality, a much more imposing  apparition than Sirius itself. Remembering that the apparent magnitude  of the moon, according to Sec.6, amounts to -11.6, we should find that  Canopus, if placed at a distance from us equal to that of Sirius (_r_ =  0.5 sir.), would shine with a lustre equal to no less than a quarter of  that of the moon. It is not altogether astonishing that a fanciful  astronomer should have thought Canopus to be actually the central star  in the whole stellar system. We find, however, from column 8 that its  supposed distance is not less that 30 sir. We have already pointed out  that distances greater than 4 sir., when computed from annual  parallaxes, must generally be considered as rather uncertain. As the  value of _M_ is intimately dependent on that of _r_ we must consider  speculations based on this value to be very vague. Another reason for a  doubt about a great value for the real luminosity of this star is found  from its type of spectrum which, according to the last column, is F0, a  type which, as will be seen, is seldom found among giant stars. A better  support for a large distance could on the other hand be found from the  small proper motion of this star. Sirius and Canopus are the only stars  in the sky having a negative value of the apparent visual magnitude.    Space will not permit us to go through this list star for star. We may  be satisfied with some general remarks.    In the fourth column is the galactic square. We call to mind that all  these squares have the same area, and that there is therefore the same  probability _a priori_ of finding a star in one of the squares as in  another. The squares GC and GD lie along the galactic equator (the Milky  Way). We find now from column 4 that of the 20 stars here considered  there are no less than 15 in the galactic equator squares and only 5  outside, instead of 10 in the galactic squares and 10 outside, as would  have been expected. The number of objects is, indeed, too small to allow  us to draw any cosmological conclusions from this distribution, but we  shall find in the following many similar instances regarding objects  that are principally accumulated along the Milky Way and are scanty at  the galactic poles. We shall find that in these cases we may _generally_  conclude from such a partition that we then have to do with objects  _situated far from the sun_, while objects that are uniformly  distributed on the sky lie relatively near us. It is easy to understand  that this conclusion is a consequence of the supposition, confirmed by  all star counts, that the stellar system extends much farther into space  along the Milky Way than in the direction of its poles.    If we could permit ourselves to draw conclusions from the small material  here under consideration, we should hence have reason to believe that  the bright stars lie relatively far from us. In other words we should  conclude that the bright stars seem to be bright to us not because of  their proximity but because of their large intrinsic luminosity. Column  8 really tends in this direction. Certainly the distances are not in  this case colossal, but they are nevertheless sufficient to show, in  some degree, this uneven partition of the bright stars on the sky. The  mean distance of these stars is as large as 7.5 sir. Only [alpha]  Centauri, Sirius, Procyon and Altair lie at a distance smaller than one  siriometer. Of the other stars there are two that lie as far as 30  siriometers from our system. These are the two giants Canopus and Rigel.  Even if, as has already been said, the distances of these stars may be  considered as rather uncertain, we must regard them as being rather  large.    As column 8 shows that these stars are rather far from us, so we find  from column 12, that their absolute luminosity is rather large. The mean  absolute magnitude is, indeed, -2m.1. We shall find that only the  greatest and most luminous stars in the stellar system have a negative  value of the absolute magnitude.    The mean value of the proper motions of the bright stars amounts to  0\".56 per year and may be considered as rather great. We shall, indeed,  find that the mean proper motion of the stars down to the 6th magnitude  scarcely amounts to a tenth part of this value. On the other hand we  find from the table that the high value of this mean is chiefly due to  the influence of four of the stars which have a large proper motion,  namely Sirius, Arcturus, [alpha] Centauri and Procyon. The other stars  have a proper motion smaller than 1\" per year and for half the number of  stars the proper motion amounts to approximately 0\".05, indicating their  relatively great distance.    That the absolute velocity of these stars is, indeed, rather small may  be found from column 10, giving their radial velocity, which in the mean  amounts to only three siriometers per stellar year. From the discussion  below of the radial velocities of the stars we shall find that this is a  rather small figure. This fact is intimately bound up with the general  law in statistical mechanics, to which we return later, that stars with  large masses generally have a small velocity. We thus find in the radial  velocities fresh evidence, independent of the distance, that these  bright stars are giants among the stars in our stellar system.    We find all the principal spectral types represented among the bright  stars. To the helium stars (B) belong Rigel, Achernar, [beta] Centauri,  Spica, Regulus and [beta] Crucis. To the Sirius type (A) belong Sirius,  Vega, Altair, Fomalhaut and Deneb. To the Calcium type (F) Canopus and  Procyon. To the sun type (G) Capella and [alpha] Centauri. To the K-type  belong Arcturus, Aldebaran and Pollux and to the M-type the two red  stars Betelgeuze and Antares. Using the spectral indices as an  expression for the spectral types we find that the mean spectral index  of these stars is +1.1 corresponding to the spectral type F1.      31. _Stars with the greatest proper motion._ In table 3 I have collected  the stars having a proper motion greater than 3\" per year. The  designations are the same as in the preceding table, except that the  names of the stars are here taken from different catalogues.    In the astronomical literature of the last century we find the star 1830  Groombridge designed as that which possesses the greatest known proper  motion. It is now distanced by two other stars C. P.
