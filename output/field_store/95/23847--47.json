Thus the lines were distinctly drawn and the warfare between  contending principles was joined. Those who fondly dreamed of a  permanently united and solid Protestantism to withstand its powerful  antagonist were destined to speedy and inevitable disappointment. There  have been many to deplore that so soon after the protest of Augsburg was  set forth as embodying the common belief of Protestants new parties  should have arisen protesting against the protest. The ordinance of the  Lord's Supper, instituted as a sacrament of universal Christian  fellowship, became (as so often before and since) the center of  contention and the badge of mutual alienation. It was on this point that  Zwingli and the Swiss parted from Luther and the Lutherans; on the same  point, in the next generation of Reformers, John Calvin, attempting to  mediate between the two contending parties, became the founder of still  a third party, strong not only in the lucid and logical doctrinal  statements in which it delighted, but also in the possession of a  definite scheme of republican church government which became as  distinctive of the Calvinistic or \"Reformed\" churches as their doctrine  of the Supper. It was at a later epoch still that those insoluble  questions which press most inexorably for consideration when theological  thought and study are most serious and earnest--the questions that  concern the divine sovereignty in its relation to human freedom and  responsibility--arose in the Catholic Church to divide Jesuit from  Dominican and Franciscan, and in the Reformed churches to divide the  Arminians from the disciples of Gomar and Turretin. All these divisions  among the European Christians of the seventeenth century were to have  their important bearing on the planting of the Christian church in  America.    In view of the destined predominance of English influence in the  seaboard colonies of America, the history of the divisions of the  Christian people of England is of preeminent importance to the  beginnings of the American church. The curiously diverse elements that  entered into the English Reformation, and the violent vicissitudes that  marked the course of it, were all represented in the parties existing  among English Christians at the period of the planting of the colonies.    The political and dynastic character of the movements that detached the  English hierarchy from the Roman see had for one inevitable result to  leaven the English church as a lump with the leaven of Herod. That  considerable part of the clergy and people that moved to and fro,  without so much as the resistance of any very formidable _vis inertiae_,  with the change of the monarch or of the monarch's caprice, might leave  the student of the history of those times in doubt as to whether they  belonged to the kingdom of heaven or to the kingdom of this world. But,  however severe the judgment that any may pass upon the character and  motives of Henry VIII. and of the councilors of Edward, there will  hardly be any seriously to question that the movements directed by these  men soon came to be infused with more serious and spiritual influences.  The Lollardy of Wycliffe and his fellows in the fourteenth century had  been severely repressed and driven into \"occult conventicles,\" but had  not been extinguished; the Bible in English, many times retouched after  Wycliffe's days, and perfected by the refugees at Geneva from the Marian  persecutions, had become a common household book; and those exiles  themselves, returning from the various centers of fervid religious  thought and feeling in Holland and Germany and Switzerland, had brought  with them an augmented spiritual faith, as well as intensified and  sharply defined convictions on the questions of theology and church  order that were debated by the scholars of the Continent. It was  impossible that the diverse and antagonist elements thus assembled  should not work on one another with violent reactions. By the beginning  of the seventeenth century not less than four categories would suffice  to classify the people of England according to their religious  differences. First, there were those who still continued to adhere to  the Roman see. Secondly, those who, either from conviction or from  expediency or from indifference, were content with the state church of  England in the shape in which Elizabeth and her parliaments had left it;  this class naturally included the general multitude of Englishmen,  religious, irreligious, and non-religious. Thirdly, there were those  who, not refusing their adhesion to the national church as by law  established, nevertheless earnestly desired to see it more completely  purified from doctrinal errors and practical corruptions, and who  qualified their conformity to it accordingly. Fourthly, there were the  few who distinctly repudiated the national church as a false church,  coming out from her as from Babylon, determined upon \"reformation  without tarrying for any.\" Finally, following upon these, more radical,  not to say more logical, than the rest, came a fifth party, the  followers of George Fox. Not one of these five parties but has valid  claims, both in its principles and in its membership, on the respect of  history; not one but can point to its saints and martyrs; not one but  was destined to play a quite separate and distinct and highly important  part in the planting of the church of Christ in America. They are  designated, for convenience' sake, as the Catholics, the Conformists,  the Puritans or Reformists, the Separatists (of whom were the Pilgrims),  and the Quakers.    Such a Christendom was it, so disorganized, divided, and subdivided into  parties and sects, which was to furnish the materials for the peopling  of the new continent with a Christian population. It would seem that the  same \"somewhat not ourselves,\" which had defeated in succession the  plans of two mighty nations to subject the New World to a single  hierarchy, had also provided that no one form or organization of  Christianity should be exclusive or even dominant in the occupation of  the American soil. From one point of view the American colonies will  present a sorry aspect. Schism, mutual alienation, antagonism,  competition, are uncongenial to the spirit of the gospel, which seeks  \"that they all may be one.\" And yet the history of the church has  demonstrated by many a sad example that this offense \"must needs come.\"  No widely extended organization of church discipline in exclusive  occupation of any country has ever long avoided the intolerable  mischiefs attendant on spiritual despotism. It was a shock to the hopes  and the generous sentiments of those who had looked to see one undivided  body of a reformed church erected over against the medieval church,  from the corruptions of which they had revolted, when they saw  Protestantism go asunder into the several churches of the Lutheran and  the Reformed confessions; there are many even now to deplore it as a  disastrous set-back to the progress of the kingdom of Christ. But in the  calmness of our long retrospect it is easy for us to recognize that  whatever jurisdiction should have been established over an undivided  Protestant church would inevitably have proved itself, in no long time,  just such a yoke as neither the men of that time nor their fathers had  been able to bear. Fifteen centuries of church history have not been  wasted if thereby the Christian people have learned that the pursuit of  Christian unity through administrative or corporate or diplomatic union  is following the wrong road, and that the one Holy Catholic Church is  not the corporation of saints, but their communion.    The new experiment of church life that was initiated in the colonization  of America is still in progress. The new States were to be planted not  only with diverse companies from the Old World, but with all the  definitely organized sects by which the map of Christendom was at that  time variegated, to which should be added others of native origin.  Notwithstanding successive \"booms\" now of one and then of another, it  was soon to become obvious to all that no one of these mutually jealous  sects was to have any exclusive predominance, even over narrow precincts  of territory. The old-world state churches, which under the rule, _cujus  regio ejus religio_, had been supreme and exclusive each in its  jurisdiction, were to find themselves side by side and mingled through  the community on equal terms with those over whom in the old country  they had domineered as dissenters, or whom perhaps they had even  persecuted as heretics or as Antichrist. Thus placed, they were to be  trained by the discipline of divine Providence and by the grace of the  Holy Spirit from persecution to toleration, from toleration to mutual  respect, and to cooeperation in matters of common concern in the  advancement of the kingdom of Christ. What further remains to be tried  is the question whether, if not the sects, then the Christian hearts in  each sect, can be brought to take the final step from mutual respect to  mutual love, \"that we henceforth, speaking truth in love, may grow up in  all things into him, which is the head, even Christ; from whom all the  body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint  supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part,  shall make the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in  love.\" Unless we must submit to those philosophers who forbid us to find  in history the evidences of final cause and providential design, we may  surely look upon this as a worthy possible solution of the mystery of  Providence in the planting of the church in America in almost its  ultimate stage of schism--that it is the purpose of its Head, out of the  mutual attrition of the sects, their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#8)"],[1,"to S. Nicholas and S. Giles, S. Gregory and S. Benedict. Over  the site of the latter may still be seen remains of fresco painting. The  altars in the south transept were dedicated--one to S. Faith and S.  Thomas the Apostle, one to our Lady of Bolton and the other to our Lady  of Houghall. The north transept is closed by a large window, which is  the work of Prior Fossor, probably about the year 1362. The window is of  six lights, and the head contains late geometrical tracery. The  architectural feature of this window, especially for its date, is the  transom which crosses the mullions, and which is not visible from the  exterior. Below the transom is a second inner set of mullions supporting  a small gallery, by means of which access may be had to the triforium.  In the year 1512 the window was repaired by Prior Castell, who filled it  with stained glass containing large figures, among others of S.  Augustine, S. Ambrose, S. Gregory, and S. Jerome. From this circumstance  the window became known as the window of the Four Doctors of the Church.  Prior Castell also contrived to introduce a figure of himself kneeling  at the feet of the Virgin. The large window at the end of the south  transept, also named from the glass it contained, the _Te Deum_ window,  is in the Perpendicular style, and is of six lights. It may possibly  have been the work of Prior Wessington, 1416 to 1446. Along the sill of  this window also access may be had to the triforium.    [Illustration: The Transepts, looking North.]    Both the north-west and south-west corners of the transepts contain  stairways, opening at their various levels on to the triforium,  clerestory, and the space between the vaulting and the roof. That in the  south transept also gives access to the central tower and belfry, an  ascent of which, if the day be clear, will repay the visitor for his  fatiguing climb of three hundred and forty steps by the magnificent view  spread at his feet. The transepts were no doubt the earliest part of the  building to be vaulted; that of the northern arm being plain is probably  the earlier, while that of the south arm, though of similar character,  has zig-zag ornaments. Several of the priors of Durham were buried in  the transepts, the first, Prior Fossor, 1364, and the last, Robert  Ebchester, who died in 1484.    On the piers of the transepts projecting brackets may be noticed. These  are of Perpendicular date, and originally carried statues.    The crossing, or space between the four piers supporting the central  tower, gives us a fine view of the interior of the lantern.    The #Tower# is carried on four large clustered Norman piers with  semi-circular arches. Over the arches, and seventy-seven feet above the  floor of the church, is the lower stage of the lantern, round which is a  gallery with an open pierced parapet. It rests on corbels, each  alternate one being carved with a grotesque head. The walls are panelled  up to the base of the great windows,--each panel having two cinquefoiled  arches under a crocketed canopy and final; while between them are small  buttresses, also panelled, and ending in a finial which reaches the same  height as the canopy. Over the panelling is a string course ornamented  with that characteristic ornament of the Perpendicular period, the Tudor  flower, and above this on each face two tall windows near together. Each  window has two lights, and is divided by a transom. The roof of the  lantern is groined, with fine bosses at the intersections of the ribs.  The whole seen from below has a very fine effect, and must be very  different in appearance from the original Norman structure. The whole of  the lantern was refaced, and the statues which had been removed from  their niches were replaced, some thirty years ago, by the Dean and  Chapter of Durham.    [Illustration: Corbel in Choir.]    The #Norman East End.#--The original form of the Norman east end has  long been the subject of discussion and conjecture. It was practically  safe to assume that the choir ended in an apse, though whether the  aisles were also apsidal, or continued round a great apse as an  ambulatory, was a debatable point. This question has now been finally  settled.    [Illustration: The Choir, looking East.] During some operations  necessitating the opening of the floor, in January 1895, certain  indications were found which led the diocesan architect, Mr C.H. Fowler,  and Canon Greenwell to continue the excavation. The result was the  discovery that Carileph's church certainly possessed three apses--a  large one terminating the choir, and smaller ones the aisles. The apses  of the aisles were square externally, and apsidal internally. The great  apse consisted of five bays, one on either side next to the choir,  forming an oblong between the choir and the springing line of the curve  of the apse, over which would be the great sanctuary arch. The  remainder, or apse proper, was divided into three bays by engaged  clustered shafts, similar to those of the choir and nave. It was  surrounded by a wall arcade of the same character as that of the rest of  the church. The base of one of the shafts of the arcade was found in  position. An extremely interesting point in this discovery is the fact  that the levels are the same as those of the nave and choir. The  foundations are on the rock at the same depth, and the aisle walls and  apse walls are in the same line. The external square line of the aisle  apses is in line with the springing of the choir apse. The foundations  of the apse to the north aisle have been thoroughly excavated, and there  is every reason to believe that that on the south side of the church  entirely corresponds. The width of the north aisle apse from north to  south is nine feet eight inches. There can be little doubt, judging from  the remainder of Carileph's work, that all three apses were covered with  stone vaults, though of precisely what character can only be a matter of  conjecture. The cracking, previously spoken of, which led to this part  of the church being taken down and the new eastern transept being  erected, cannot have arisen from any subsidence of the foundations. It,  in all probability, was the result of the thrust of the apse vaults on  to walls which were insufficiently buttressed. The marks on some of the  stones found during this excavation, and the shape of others, seem to  point to the conclusion that here we have the earliest part of the  church, and that Carileph used up in his foundations much of the stone  of Aldhun's White Church.    Of the two usual eastern endings to Norman churches--viz. those with  three apses, and those having the aisle carried round as an  ambulatory--the latter is far more common in England, and the former on  the Continent. There are two other notable instances of the three  apsidal arrangement in England: S. Albans, 1077, which is earlier than  Durham; and Peterboro', 1117, which is later than, and was probably  modelled on, Durham. There are many examples of ambulatories--the White  Tower Church (London), Winchester, Gloucester, Worcester, and Norwich  being among them.    [Illustration: Corbel in Choir.]    The apses of Durham are of considerable depth from east to west, the  oblong bay previously mentioned, which is fourteen feet wide in that  direction, adding greatly to this effect. The width of the foundations  is fourteen feet, and the width of the wall has been seven feet. The  diameter of the choir apse from north to south was about thirty-two  feet.    [Illustration: Plan of Norman East End.]    These discoveries are specially interesting, completing as they do the  whole chain, and leading us with very little imagination to see in its  original condition what must have been, and may even now claim to be,  the most noble example of Norman architecture in our country.    [Illustration: Triforium of Nave and Choir.]    [Illustration: Capital in the Nine Altars Chapel.]    The #Nine Altars Chapel.#--Leaving the consideration of what once  occupied the site of the east end of Durham, we will turn our attention  to the beautiful erection which now stands there, the eastern transept,  or, as it is named from the altars of the saints it once contained  beneath its windows, the Chapel of the Nine Altars. It is approached  from the aisles by steps, the floor level being lower than that of the  church proper. It is altogether a remarkable and interesting structure.  With its lightness and loftiness contrasting grandly with the massive  Norman nave and choir, its clustered columns of polished marble  alternating with stone, its fine bold sculpture, its splendid vaulted  roof and rich arcading, it forms a perfect example of the Early English  style. Though regular and symmetrical in general design, the detail  shows great variety, and even irregularity, a quality so often present  in old work, and so much to its advantage. In general character it may  be compared with that at Fountains Abbey, which was built during the  same time.    [Illustration: Capital in the Nine Altars Chapel.]    The circumstances leading to its erection have been already referred to.  The Norman apses having been partly removed, owing to their dangerous  condition, the \"New Work,\" as it was always called, was commenced in the  year 1242. The eastern wall, with its rose and nine lancet windows, is  the earliest part of the chapel, the north and south walls being later.  The joining and blending of the work with the Norman of Carileph's choir  had evidently been accomplished when the chapel was almost completed.  The eastern wall is of three bays, each bay having three lofty lancet  windows. The bays are not of equal width, the centre one being regulated  by the width of the nave of the church, and narrower than the north and  south bays.    [Illustration: Sections of Hood and Arch Mouldings.]    A very beautiful arcade runs completely round the walls. It is of"]]]
