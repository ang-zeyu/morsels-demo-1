[Illustration:    THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.    _By Fouquet._    (Musee Conde, Chantilly.)]    The Reformation marks a change in the character of Christmas poetry in  England and the larger part of Germany, and, instead of following its  development under Protestantism, it will be well to break off and turn  awhile to countries where Catholic tradition remained unbroken. We shall  come back later to Post-Reformation England and Protestant Germany.    In French{1} there is little or no Christmas poetry, religious in  character, before the fifteenth century; the earlier carols that have  come down to us are songs rather of feasting and worldly rejoicing than  of sacred things. The true _Noel_ begins to appear in fifteenth-century  manuscripts, but it was not till the following century that it attained  its fullest vogue and was spread all over the country by the printing  presses. Such _Noels_ seem to have been written by clerks or recognized  poets, either for old airs or for specially composed music. \"To a great  extent,\" says Mr. Gregory Smith, \"they anticipate the spirit which  stimulated the Reformers to turn the popular and often obscene songs into  good and godly ballads.\"{2}    Some of the early _Noels_ are not unlike the English carols of the  period, and are often half in Latin, half in French. Here are a few such  \"macaronic\" verses:--       \"Celebrons la naissance      _Nostri Salvatoris_, |56|      Qui fait la complaisance      _Dei sui Patris_.      Cet enfant tout aimable,      _In nocte media_,      Est ne dans une etable,      _De casta Maria_.           *       *       *       *       *        Mille esprits angeliques,      _Juncti pastoribus_,      Chantent dans leur musique,      _Puer vobis natus_,      Au Dieu par qui nous sommes,      _Gloria in excelsis_,      Et la paix soit aux hommes      _Bonae voluntatis_.           *       *       *       *       *        Qu'on ne soit insensible!      _Adeamus omnes_      A Dieu rendu passible,      _Propter nos mortales_,      Et tous, de compagnie,      _Deprecemur eum_      Qu'a la fin de la vie,      _Det regnum beatum_.\"{3}    The sixteenth century is the most interesting _Noel_ period; we find then  a conflict of tendencies, a conflict between Gallic realism and broad  humour and the love of refined language due to the study of the ancient  classics. There are many anonymous pieces of this time, but three  important _Noelistes_ stand out by name: Lucas le Moigne, Cure of Saint  Georges, Puy-la-Garde, near Poitiers; Jean Daniel, called \"Maitre Mitou,\"  a priest-organist at Nantes; and Nicholas Denisot of Le Mans, whose  _Noels_ appeared posthumously under the pseudonym of \"Comte d'Alsinoys.\"    Lucas le Moigne represents the _esprit gaulois_, the spirit that is often  called \"Rabelaisian,\" though it is only one side of the genius of  Rabelais. The good Cure was a contemporary of |57| the author of  \"Pantagruel.\" His \"Chansons de Noels nouvaulx\" was published in 1520, and  contains carols in very varied styles, some naive and pious, others  hardly quotable at the present day. One of his best-known pieces is a  dialogue between the Virgin and the singers of the carol: Mary is asked  and answers questions about the wondrous happenings of her life. Here are  four verses about the Nativity:--       \"Or nous dites, Marie,      Les neuf mois accomplis,      Naquit le fruit de vie,      Comme l'Ange avoit dit?      --Oui, sans nulle peine      Et sans oppression,      Naquit de tout le monde      La vraie Redemption.          Or nous dites, Marie,      Du lieu imperial,      Fut-ce en chambre paree,      Ou en Palais royal?      --En une pauvre etable      Ouverte a l'environ      Ou n'avait feu, ni flambe      Ni latte, ni chevron.          Or nous dites, Marie,      Qui vous vint visiter;      Les bourgeois de la ville      Vous ont-ils confortee?      --Oncque, homme ni femme      N'en eut compassion,      Non plus que d'un esclave      D'etrange region.           *       *       *       *       *          Or nous dites, Marie,      Des pauvres pastoureaux      Qui gardaient es montagnes      Leurs brebis & aigneaux. |58|      --Ceux-la m'ont visitee      Par grande affection;      Moult me fut agreable      Leur visitation.\"{4}    The influence of the \"Pleiade,\" with its care for form, its respect for  classical models, its enrichment of the French tongue with new Latin  words, is shown by Jean Daniel, who also owes something to the poets of  the late fifteenth century. Two stanzas may be quoted from him:--           \"C'est ung tres grant mystere          Qu'ung roy de si hault pris          Vient naistre en lieu austere,          En si meschant pourpris:      Le Roy de tous les bons espritz,          C'est Jesus nostre frere,      Le Roy de tous les bons espritz,          Duquel sommes apris.        Saluons le doulx Jesuchrist,          Notre Dieu, notre frere,      Saluons le doulx Jesuchrist,          Chantons Noel d'esprit!           *       *       *       *       *            En luy faisant priere,          Soyons de son party,          Qu'en sa haulte emperiere          Ayons lieu de party;      Comme il nous a droict apparty,          Jesus nostre bon frere,      Comme il nous a droict apparty          Au celeste convy.      Saluons, etc.          Amen. Noel.\"{5}    As for Denisot, I may give two charming verses from one of his  pastorals:--       \"Suz, Bergiez, en campaigne,      Laissez la vos troppeaux, |59|      Avant qu'on s'accompaigne,      Enflez vos chalumeaux.           *       *       *       *       *        Enflez vos cornemuses,      Dansez ensemblement,      Et vos doucettes muses,      Accollez doucement.\"{6}    One result of the Italian influences which came over France in the  sixteenth century was a fondness for diminutives. Introduced into carols,  these have sometimes a very graceful effect:--       \"Entre le boeuf & le bouvet,          Noel nouvellet,      Voulust Jesus nostre maistre,      En un petit hostelet,          Noel nouvellet,      En ce pauvre monde naistre,          O Noel nouvellet!        Ne couche, ne bercelet,          Noel nouvellet,      Ne trouverent en cette estre,      Fors ung petit drappelet,          Noel nouvellet,      Pour envelopper le maistre,          O Noel nouvellet!\"{7}    These diminutives are found again, though fewer, in a particularly  delightful carol:--          \"Laissez paitre vos bestes      Pastoureaux, par monts et par vaux;        Laissez paitre vos bestes,        Et allons chanter Nau.        J'ai oui chanter le rossignol,      Qui chantoit un chant si nouveau,        Si haut, si beau,        Si resonneau, |60|          Il m'y rompoit la tete,      Tant il chantoit et flageoloit:        Adonc pris ma houlette        Pour aller voir Naulet.        Laissez paitre, etc.\"{8}    The singer goes on to tell how he went with his fellow-shepherds and  shepherdesses to Bethlehem:--       \"Nous dimes tous une chanson      Les autres en vinrent au son,          Chacun prenant          Son compagnon:        Je prendrai Guillemette,      Margot tu prendras gros Guillot;        Qui prendra Peronelle?        Ce sera Talebot.        Laissez paitre, etc.        Ne chantons plus, nous tardons trop,      Pensons d'aller courir le trot.          Viens-tu, Margot?--          J'attends Guillot.--        J'ai rompu ma courette,      Il faut ramancher mon sabot.--        Or, tiens cette aiguillette,        Elle y servira trop.        Laissez paitre, etc.           *       *       *       *       *        Nous courumes de grand' roideur      Pour voir notre doux Redempteur          Et Createur          Et Formateur,        Qui etait tendre d'aage      Et sans linceux en grand besoin,        Il gisait en la creche        Sur un botteau de foin.        Laissez paitre, etc. |61|        Sa mere avecque lui etait:      Et Joseph si lui eclairait,          Point ne semblait          Au beau fillet,        Il n'etait point son pere;      Je l'apercus bien au cameau (_visage_)        Il semblait a sa mere,        Encore est-il plus beau.        Laissez paitre, etc.\"    This is but one of a large class of French _Noels_ which make the  Nativity more real, more present, by representing the singer as one of a  company of worshippers going to adore the Child. Often these are  shepherds, but sometimes they are simply the inhabitants of a parish, a  town, a countryside, or a province, bearing presents of their own produce  to the little Jesus and His parents. Barrels of wine, fish, fowls,  sucking-pigs, pastry, milk, fruit, firewood, birds in a cage--such are  their homely gifts. Often there is a strongly satiric note: the  peculiarities and weaknesses of individuals are hit off; the reputation  of a place is suggested, a village whose people are famous for their  stinginess offers cider that is half rain-water; elsewhere the  inhabitants are so given to law-suits that they can hardly find time to  go to Bethlehem.    Such _Noels_ with their vivid local colour, are valuable pictures of the  manners of their time. They are, unfortunately, too long for quotation  here, but any reader who cares to follow up the subject will find some  interesting specimens in a little collection of French carols that can be  bought for ten _centimes_.{9} They are of various dates; some probably  were written as late as the eighteenth century. In that century, and  indeed in the seventeenth, the best Christmas verses are those of a  provincial and rustic character,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#8)"],[1,"yron colour when she is  in her Perige or neerest to us, therefore shee hath not any light of her  owne. Nor may we thinke that the earths shadow can cloud the proper  light of the Moone from appearing, or take away any thing from her  inherent brightnesse, for this were to thinke a shadow to be a body, an  opinion altogether mis-becomming a Philosopher, as _Tycho_ grants in the  fore-cited place,      _Nec umbra terrae corporeum quid est, aut densa aliqua substantia,    aut lunae lumen obtenebrare possit, atque id visui nostro praeripere,    sed est quaedam privatio luminis solaris, ob interpositum opacum    corpus terrae._    Nor is the earths shadow any corporall thing, or thicke substance, that  it can cloud the Moones brightnesse, or take it away from our sight, but  it is a meere privation of the Suns light, by reason of the  interposition of the earths opacous body.      [Sidenote 1: Reinhold _comment. in Purb. Theor. pag. 164._]    2. If shee had any light of her owne then that would in it selfe be,  either such a ruddy brightnesse as appeares in the eclipses, or else  such a leaden duskish light as wee see in the darker parts of her body,  when shee is a little past the conjunction. (That it must be one of  these may follow from the opposite arguments) but it is neither of  these, therefore she hath none of her owne.    1. 'Tis not such a ruddy light as appeares in eclipses, for then why can  wee not see the like rednesse, when wee may discerne the obscurer parts  of the Moone?    You will say, perhaps, that then the neerenesse of that greater light,  takes away that appearance.    I reply, this cannot be, for then why does Mars shine with his wonted  rednesse, when he is neere the Moone? or why cannot her greater  brightnesse make him appeare white as the other Planets? nor can there  be any reason given why that greater light should represent her body  under a false colour.    2. 'Tis not such a duskish leaden light, as we see in the darker part of  her body, when shee is about a sextile Aspect distant from the Sunne,  for then why does shee appeare red in the eclipses, since the more shade  cannot choose such variety, for 'tis the nature of darknesse by its  opposition, rather to make things appeare of a more white and cleare  brightnesse then they are in themselves, or if it be the shade, yet  those parts of the Moone are then in the shade of her body, and  therefore in reason should have the like rednesse. Since then neither of  these lights are hers, it followes that she hath none of her owne. Nor  is this a singular opinion, but it hath had many learned patrons, such  was _Macrobius_,[1] who being for this quoted of _Rhodiginus_, he calls  him _vir reconditissimae scientiae_,[2] a man who knew more than ordinary  Philosophers, thus commending the opinion in the credit of the Authour.  To him assents the Venerable _Bede_, upon whom the glosse hath this  comparison.[3] As the Looking-glasse represents not any image within it  selfe, unlesse it receive some from without; so the Moone hath not any  light, but what is bestowed by the Sun. To these agreed _Albertus  Magnus_, _Scaliger_, _Maeslin_, and more especially _Mulapertius_,[4]  whose words are more pat to the purpose then others, and therefore I  shall set them downe as you may finde them in his Preface to his  Treatise concerning the _Austriaca sydera_;      _Luna, Venus, & Mercurius, terrestris & humidae sunt substantiae    ideoque de suo non lucere, sicut nec terra._    The Moone, _Venus_, and _Mercurie_ (saith he) are of an earthly and  moyst substance, and therefore have no more light of their owne, then  the earth hath. Nay, some there are who thinke that all the other  Starres doe receive that light, whereby they appeare visible to us from  the Sunne, so _Ptolomie_, _Isidore Hispalensis_, _Albertus Magnus_ and  _Bede_, much more then must the Moone shine with a borrowed light.[5]      [Sidenote 1: _Somn. Scip. l. 1. c. 20._]      [Sidenote 2: _Lect. antiq. l. 1. c. 15._]      [Sidenote 3: _In lib. de natur. rerum._]      [Sidenote 4: _De 4r. Coaevis. Q. 4ª. Art. 21._    _Exercit. 62._    _1. Epitome. Astron. lib. 4. p. 2._]      [Sidenote 5: _Originum l. 3. c. 60._    _De Coelo. l. 2._    _De ratione tempor. c. 4._]    But enough of this. I have now sufficiently shewed what at the first I  promised, that this light is not proper to the Moone. It remaines in the  next place, that I tell you the true reason of it. And here, I thinke  'tis probable that the light which appeares in the Moone at the eclipses  is nothing else but the second species of the Sunnes rayes which passe  through the shadow unto her body: and from a mixture of this second  light with the shadow, arises that rednesse which at such times appeares  unto us. I may call it _Lumen crepusculum_, the _Aurora_ of the Moone,  or such a kinde of blushing light, that the Sunne causes when he is  neere his rising, when he bestowes some small light upon the thicker  vapours. Thus wee see commonly the Sunne being in the Horizon, and the  reflexion growing weake, how his beames make the waters appeare very  red.    The Moabites in _Iehorams_ time when they rose early in the morning, and  beheld the waters a farre off, mistooke them for blood.[1]      _Et causa hujus est, quia radius solaris in aurora contrahit quandam    rubedinem, propter vapores combustos manentes circa superficiem    terrae, per quos radii transeunt, & ideo cum repercutiantur in aqua    ad oculos nostros, trahunt secum eundem ruborem, & faciunt apparere    locum aquarum, in quo est repercussio esse rubrum_,    saith _Tostatus_.[2] The reason is, because of his rayes, which being in  the lower vapours, those doe convey an imperfect mixed light upon the  waters. Thus the Moone being in the earths shadow, and the Sunne beames  which are round about it, not being able to come directly unto her body,  yet some second raies there are, which passing through the shadow, make  her appeare in that ruddy colour: So that she must appeare brightest,  when shee is eclipsed, being in her Apoge, of greatest distance from us,  because then the cone of the earths shadow is lesse, and the refraction  is made through a narrower medium. So on the contrary, she must be  represented under a more darke and obscure forme when she is eclipsed,  being in her Perige, or neerest to the earth, because then she is  involved in a greater shadow, or bigger part of the cone, and so the  refraction passing through a greater medium, the light must needes be  weaker which doth proceed from it. If you aske now what the reason may  be of that light which we discerne in the darker part of the new Moone:  I answer, 'tis reflected from our earth which returnes as great a  brightnesse to that Planet, as it receives from it. This I shall have  occasion to prove afterward.      [Sidenote 1: 2 King. 3. 22.]      [Sidenote 2: _2ª. Quaest. in hoc cap._]    I have now done with these propositions which were set downe to cleare  the passage, and confirme the suppositions implied in the opinion, I  shall in the next place proceed to a more direct treating of the chiefe  matter in hand.          Proposition 6.    _That there is a world in the Moone, hath beene the direct opinion of    many ancient, with some moderne Mathematicians, and may probably be    deduced from the tenents of others._      Since this opinion may be suspected of singularity, I shall therefore  first confirme it by sufficient authority of divers authours, both  ancient and moderne, that so I may the better cleare it from the  prejudice either of an upstart fancy, or an absolute errour. This is by  some attributed to _Orpheus_, one of the most ancient Greeke Poets, who  speaking of the Moone, saies thus, +he poll' ourea echei, poll' astea,  polla melathra+,[1] That it hath many mountaines and cities, and houses  in it. To him assented _Xenophanes_, _Anaxagoras_, _Democritus_, and  _Heraclitus_,[2] all who thought it to have firme solid ground, like to  our earth,[3] containing in it many large fields, champion grounds, and  divers inhabitants, unto these agreed _Pythagoras_, who thought that our  earth was but one of the Planets which moved round about the Sunne,[4]  (as _Aristotle_ relates it of him) and the _Pythagoreans_ in generall  did affirme, that the Moone also was terrestriall, that she was  inhabited as this lower world. That those living creatures & plants  which are in her, exceed any of the like kind with us in the same  proportion, as their daies are longer than ours: _viz._ by 15 times.  This _Pythagoras_[5] was esteemed by all, of a most divine wit, as  appeares especially by his valuation amongst the _Romans_ who being  comanded by the Oracle to erect a statue to the wisest _Grecian_, the  Senate determined[6] _Pythagoras_ to be meant, preferring him in their  judgements before the divine _Socrates_, whom their Gods pronounc'd the  wisest. Some think him a _Iew_ by birth, but most agree that hee was  much conversant amongst the learneder sort, & Priests of that Nation,  by whom he was informed of many secrets, and perhaps, this opinion,  which he vented afterwards in _Greece_, where he was much opposed by  _Aristotle_ in some worded disputations, but never confuted by any solid  reason.      [Sidenote 1: _Plut. de plac. phil. l. 2. c. 13._]      [Sidenote 2: _Ibid. c. 25._]      [Sidenote 3: _Diog.

Hist. l. 34. cap. 6._]    To this opinion of _Pythagoras_ did _Plato_ also assent, when hee  considered that there was the like eclipse made by the earth, and this,  that it had no light of its owne, that it was so full of spots. And  therefore wee may often reade in him and his followers,[1] of an  _aetherea terra_, and _lunares populi_, an aethereall earth, and  inhabiters in the Moone; but afterwards this was mixed with many"]]]
