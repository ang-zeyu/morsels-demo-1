And for everyone it is now easy to travel to any land, to  associate and exchange views with its peoples, and to become familiar,  through publications, with the conditions, the religious beliefs and the  thoughts of all men. In like manner all the members of the human family,  whether peoples or governments, cities or villages, have become  increasingly interdependent. For none is self-sufficiency any longer  possible, inasmuch as political ties unite all peoples and nations, and  the bonds of trade and industry, of agriculture and education, are being  strengthened every day. Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day be  achieved. Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this  wondrous age, this glorious century. Of this past ages have been deprived,  for this century--the century of light--hath been endowed with unique and  unprecedented glory, power and illumination. Hence the miraculous  unfolding of a fresh marvel every day. Eventually it will be seen how  bright its candles will burn in the assemblage of man.    Behold how its light is now dawning upon the world's darkened horizon. The  first candle is unity in the political realm, the early glimmerings of  which can now be discerned. The second candle is unity of thought in world  undertakings, the consummation of which will erelong be witnessed. The  third candle is unity in freedom which will surely come to pass. The  fourth candle is unity in religion which is the corner-stone of the  foundation itself, and which, by the power of God, will be revealed in all  its splendour. The fifth candle is the unity of nations--a unity which in  this century will be securely established, causing all the peoples of the  world to regard themselves as citizens of one common fatherland. The sixth  candle is unity of races, making of all that dwell on earth peoples and  kindreds of one race. The seventh candle is unity of language, i.e., the  choice of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and  converse. Each and every one of these will inevitably come to pass,  inasmuch as the power of the Kingdom of God will aid and assist in their  realization.            16: O YE ILLUMINED LOVED ONES AND YE HANDMAIDS OF THE ...      O ye illumined loved ones and ye handmaids of the Merciful! At a time when  the sombre night of ignorance, of neglect of the divine world, of being  veiled from God, had overspread the earth, a bright morning dawned and a  rising light lit up the eastern sky. Then rose the Sun of Truth and the  splendours of the Kingdom were shed over east and west. Those who had eyes  to see rejoiced at the glad tidings and cried out: 'O blessed, blessed are  we!', and they witnessed the inner reality of all things, and uncovered  the mysteries of the Kingdom. Delivered then from their fancies and their  doubts, they beheld the light of truth, and so exhilarated did they become  from draining the chalice of God's love, that they utterly forgot the  world and their own selves. Dancing for joy they hastened to the place of  their own martyrdom and there, where men die for love, they flung away  their heads and hearts.    But those with unseeing eyes were astonished at this tumult, and they  cried, 'Where is the light?' and again, 'We see no light! We see no rising  sun! Here is no truth. This is but fantasy and nothing more.' Bat-like  they fled into the underground dark, and there, to their way of thinking,  they found a measure of security and peace.    This, however, is but the beginning of the dawn, and the heat of the  rising Orb of Truth is not yet at the fullness of its power. Once the sun  hath mounted to high noon, its fires will burn so hot as to stir even the  creeping things beneath the earth; and although it is not for them to  behold the light, yet will they all be set in frenzied motion by the  impact of the heat.    Wherefore, O ye beloved of God, offer up thanks that ye have, in the day  of the dawning, turned your faces unto the Light of the World and beheld  its splendours. Ye have received a share of the light of truth, ye have  enjoyed a portion of those blessings that endure forever; and therefore,  as a returning of thanks for this bounty, rest ye not for a moment, sit ye  not silent, carry to men's ears the glad tidings of the Kingdom, spread  far and wide the Word of God.    Act in accordance with the counsels of the Lord: that is, rise up in such  wise, and with such qualities, as to endow the body of this world with a  living soul, and to bring this young child, humanity, to the stage of  adulthood. So far as ye are able, ignite a candle of love in every  meeting, and with tenderness rejoice and cheer ye every heart. Care for  the stranger as for one of your own; show to alien souls the same loving  kindness ye bestow upon your faithful friends. Should any come to blows  with you, seek to be friends with him; should any stab you to the heart,  be ye a healing salve unto his sores; should any taunt and mock at you,  meet him with love. Should any heap his blame upon you, praise ye him;  should he offer you a deadly poison, give him the choicest honey in  exchange; and should he threaten your life, grant him a remedy that will  heal him evermore. Should he be pain itself, be ye his medicine; should he  be thorns, be ye his roses and sweet herbs. Perchance such ways and words  from you will make this darksome world turn bright at last; will make this  dusty earth turn heavenly, this devilish prison place become a royal  palace of the Lord--so that war and strife will pass and be no more, and  love and trust will pitch their tents on the summits of the world. Such is  the essence of God's admonitions; such in sum are the teachings for the  Dispensation of Baha.            17: O YE WHO ARE THE CHOSEN ONES OF THE ABHA KINGDOM! ...      O ye who are the chosen ones of the Abha Kingdom! Praise ye the Lord of  Hosts for He, riding upon the clouds, hath come down to this world out of  the heaven of the invisible realm, so that East and West were lit by the  glory of the Sun of Truth, and the call of the Kingdom was raised, and the  heralds of the realm above, with melodies of the Concourse on high, sang  out the glad tidings of the Coming. Then the whole world of being did  quiver for joy, and still the people, even as the Messiah saith, slept on:  for the day of the Manifestation, when the Lord of Hosts descended, found  them wrapped in the slumber of unknowing. As He saith in the Gospel, My  coming is even as when the thief is in the house, and the goodman of the  house watcheth not.    From amongst all mankind hath He chosen you, and your eyes have been  opened to the light of guidance and your ears attuned to the music of the  Company above; and blessed by abounding grace, your hearts and souls have  been born into new life. Thank ye and praise ye God that the hand of  infinite bestowals hath set upon your heads this gem-studded crown, this  crown whose lustrous jewels will forever flash and sparkle down all the  reaches of time.    To thank Him for this, make ye a mighty effort, and choose for yourselves  a noble goal. Through the power of faith, obey ye the teachings of God,  and let all your actions conform to His laws. Read ye The Hidden Words,  ponder the inner meanings thereof, act in accord therewith. Read, with  close attention, the Tablets of Tarazat (Ornaments), Kalimat (Words of  Paradise), Tajalliyyat (Effulgences), I_sh_raqat (Splendours), and  Bi_sh_arat (Glad Tidings), and rise up as ye are bidden in the heavenly  teachings. Thus may each one of you be even as a candle casting its light,  the centre of attraction wherever people come together; and from you, as  from a bed of flowers, may sweet scents be shed.    Raise ye a clamour like unto a roaring sea; like a prodigal cloud, rain  down the grace of heaven. Lift up your voices and sing out the songs of  the Abha Realm. Quench ye the fires of war, lift high the banners of  peace, work for the oneness of humankind and remember that religion is the  channel of love unto all peoples. Be ye aware that the children of men are  sheep of God and He their loving Shepherd, that He careth tenderly for all  His sheep and maketh them to feed in His own green pastures of grace and  giveth them to drink from the wellspring of life. Such is the way of the  Lord. Such are His bestowals. Such, from among His teachings, is His  precept of the oneness of mankind.    The portals of His blessings are opened wide and His signs are published  abroad and the glory of truth is blazing forth; inexhaustible are the  blessings. Know ye the value of this time. Strive ye with all your hearts,  raise up your voices and shout, until this dark world be filled with  light, and this narrow place of shadows be widened out, and this dust heap  of a fleeting moment be changed into a mirror for the eternal gardens of  heaven, and this globe of earth receive its portion of celestial grace.    Then will aggression crumble away, and all that maketh for disunity be  destroyed, and the structure of oneness be raised--that the Blessed Tree  may cast its shade over east and west, and the Tabernacle of the  singleness of man be set up on the high summits, and flags that betoken  love and fellowship flutter from their staffs around the world until the  sea of truth lift high its waves, and earth bring forth the roses and  sweet herbs of blessings without end, and become from pole to pole the  Abha Paradise.    These are the counsels of 'Abdu'l-Baha. It is my hope that out of the  bestowals of the Lord of Hosts ye will become the spiritual essence and  the very radiance of humankind, binding the hearts of all with bonds of  love; that through the power of the Word of God ye will bring to life the  dead now buried in the graves of their sensual desires; that ye will, with  the rays "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#8)"],[1,"last? meaning, when will be the dawn of the  Manifestation? Then he answered, \"Two thousand and three hundred days;  then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" Briefly, the purport of this  passage is that he appoints two thousand three hundred years, for in the  text of the Bible each day is a year. Then from the date of the issuing of  the edict of Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem until the day of the birth of  Christ there are 456 years, and from the birth of Christ until the day of  the manifestation of the Bab there are 1844 years. When you add 456 years  to this number it makes 2300 years. That is to say, the fulfillment of the  vision of Daniel took place in the year A.D. 1844, and this is the year of  the Bab's manifestation according to the actual text of the Book of  Daniel. Consider how clearly he determines the year of manifestation;  there could be no clearer prophecy for a manifestation than this.    In Matthew, chapter 24, verse 3, Christ clearly says that what Daniel  meant by this prophecy was the date of the manifestation, and this is the  verse: \"As He sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto Him  privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be  the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?\" One of the  explanations He gave them in reply was this (v. 15): \"When ye therefore  shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet,  stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand).\" In this  answer He referred them to the eighth chapter of the Book of Daniel,  saying that everyone who reads it will understand that it is this time  that is spoken of. Consider how clearly the manifestation of the Bab is  spoken of in the Old Testament and in the Gospel.    To conclude, let us now explain the date of the manifestation of  Baha'u'llah from the Bible. The date of Baha'u'llah is calculated  according to lunar years from the mission and the Hejira of Muhammad; for  in the religion of Muhammad the lunar year is in use, as also it is the  lunar year which is employed concerning all commands of worship.    In Daniel, chapter 12, verse 6, it is said: \"And one said to the man  clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall  it be to the end of these wonders? And I heard the man clothed in linen,  which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and  his left hand unto heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever that it  shall be for a time, times, and a half; and that when He shall have  accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things  shall be finished.\"(34)    As I have already explained the signification of one day, it is not  necessary to explain it further; but we will say briefly that each day of  the Father counts as a year, and in each year there are twelve months.  Thus three years and a half make forty-two months, and forty-two months  are twelve hundred and sixty days. The Bab, the precursor of Baha'u'llah,  appeared in the year 1260 from the Hejira of Muhammad, by the reckoning of  Islam.    Afterward, in verse 11, it is said: \"And from the time that the daily  sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolation  be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed  is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and  thirty days.\"(35)    The beginning of this lunar reckoning is from the day of the proclamation  of the prophethood of Muhammad in the country of Hijaz; and that was three  years after His mission, because in the beginning the prophethood of  Muhammad was kept secret, and no one knew it save _Kh_adijah and Ibn  Nawfal.(36) After three years it was announced. And Baha'u'llah, in the  year 1290 from the proclamation of the mission of Muhammad, caused His  manifestation to be known.(37)          11: COMMENTARY ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN      In the beginning of the eleventh chapter of the Revelation of St. John it  is said:    \"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood,  saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that  worship therein.    \"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not;  for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread  under foot forty and two months.\"    This reed is a Perfect Man Who is likened to a reed, and the manner of its  likeness is this: when the interior of a reed is empty and free from all  matter, it will produce beautiful melodies; and as the sound and melodies  do not come from the reed, but from the flute player who blows upon it, so  the sanctified heart of that blessed Being is free and emptied from all  save God, pure and exempt from the attachments of all human conditions,  and is the companion of the Divine Spirit. Whatever He utters is not from  Himself, but from the real flute player, and it is a divine inspiration.  That is why He is likened to a reed; and that reed is like a rod--that is  to say, it is the helper of every impotent one, and the support of human  beings. It is the rod of the Divine Shepherd by which He guards His flock  and leads them about the pastures of the Kingdom.    Then it is said: \"The angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of  God, and the altar, and them that worship therein\"--that is to say, compare  and measure: measuring is the discovery of proportion. Thus the angel  said: compare the temple of God and the altar and them that are praying  therein--that is to say, investigate what is their true condition and  discover in what degree and state they are, and what conditions,  perfections, behavior and attributes they possess; and make yourself  cognizant of the mysteries of those holy souls who dwell in the Holy of  Holies in purity and sanctity.    \"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not;  for it is given unto the Gentiles.\"    In the beginning of the seventh century after Christ, when Jerusalem was  conquered, the Holy of Holies was outwardly preserved--that is to say, the  house which Solomon built; but outside the Holy of Holies the outer court  was taken and given to the Gentiles. \"And the holy city shall they tread  under foot forty and two months\"--that is to say, the Gentiles shall govern  and control Jerusalem forty and two months, signifying twelve hundred and  sixty days; and as each day signifies a year, by this reckoning it becomes  twelve hundred and sixty years, which is the duration of the cycle of the  Qur'an. For in the texts of the Holy Book, each day is a year; as it is  said in the fourth chapter of Ezekiel, verse 6: \"Thou shalt bear the  iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day  for a year.\"    This prophesies the duration of the Dispensation of Islam when Jerusalem  was trodden under foot, which means that it lost its glory--but the Holy of  Holies was preserved, guarded and respected--until the year 1260. This  twelve hundred and sixty years is a prophecy of the manifestation of the  Bab, the \"Gate\" of Baha'u'llah, which took place in the year 1260 of the  Hejira of Muhammad, and as the period of twelve hundred and sixty years  has expired, Jerusalem, the Holy City, is now beginning to become  prosperous, populous and flourishing. Anyone who saw Jerusalem sixty years  ago, and who sees it now, will recognize how populous and flourishing it  has become, and how it is again honored.    This is the outward meaning of these verses of the Revelation of St. John;  but they have another explanation and a symbolic sense, which is as  follows: the Law of God is divided into two parts. One is the fundamental  basis which comprises all spiritual things--that is to say, it refers to  the spiritual virtues and divine qualities; this does not change nor  alter: it is the Holy of Holies, which is the essence of the Law of Adam,  Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Bab, and Baha'u'llah, and  which lasts and is established in all the prophetic cycles. It will never  be abrogated, for it is spiritual and not material truth; it is faith,  knowledge, certitude, justice, piety, righteousness, trustworthiness, love  of God, benevolence, purity, detachment, humility, meekness, patience and  constancy. It shows mercy to the poor, defends the oppressed, gives to the  wretched and uplifts the fallen.    These divine qualities, these eternal commandments, will never be  abolished; nay, they will last and remain established for ever and ever.  These virtues of humanity will be renewed in each of the different cycles;  for at the end of every cycle the spiritual Law of God--that is to say, the  human virtues--disappears, and only the form subsists.    Thus among the Jews, at the end of the cycle of Moses, which coincides  with the Christian manifestation, the Law of God disappeared, only a form  without spirit remaining. The Holy of Holies departed from among them, but  the outer court of Jerusalem--which is the expression used for the form of  the religion--fell into the hands of the Gentiles. In the same way, the  fundamental principles of the religion of Christ, which are the greatest  virtues of humanity, have disappeared; and its form has remained in the  hands of the clergy and the priests. Likewise, the foundation of the  religion of Muhammad has disappeared, but its form remains in the hands of  the official 'ulama.    These foundations of the Religion of God, which are spiritual and which  are the virtues of humanity, cannot be abrogated; they are irremovable and  eternal, and are renewed in the cycle of every Prophet.    The second part of the Religion of God, which refers to the material  world, and which comprises fasting, prayer, forms of worship, marriage and  divorce, the abolition of slavery, legal processes, transactions,  indemnities for murder, violence, theft and injuries--this"]]]
