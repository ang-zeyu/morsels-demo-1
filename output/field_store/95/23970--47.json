[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#8)"],[1,"good story was often told about the alleged \"Bolo Spy Dog  Patrols\" first discovered when the British officer led his Royal Scots,  most of them raw Russian recruits, to the front posts at 445 to  reinforce \"M\" Co. \"Old Ruble\" had been a familiar sight to the  Americans. At this time he had picked up a couple of cur buddies, and  was staying with the Americans at the front, having perpetual pass good  at any part of the four-square outpost. But the British officer reported  him to the American officer as a sure-enough trained Bolshevik patrol  dog and threatened to shoot him. And at four o'clock the next morning  they did fire at the dogs and started up the nervous Red Guards into  machine gun fire from their not distant trench line and brought everyone  out to man our lines for defense. And the heavy enemy shelling cut up  Scots (Russians) as well as Americans.    Here the fall advance on the Archangel-Vologda Railway ended. We were a  few versts north of Emtsa, but \"mnoga, mnoga versts,\" many versts,  distant from Vologda, the objective picked by General Poole for this  handful of men. Emtsa was a railroad repair shop village. We wanted it.  General Ironside who relieved Poole, however, had issued a general order  to hold up further advances on all the fronts. So we dug in. Winter  would soon be on, anyway.    The Red Guards, however, meant to punish us for the capture of this  position. He thoroughly and savagely shelled the position repeatedly and  the British artillery moved up as the Yankee engineers restored the  destroyed railroad track and duelled daily with the very efficient Red  artillery. We have to admit that with his knowledge of the area the Red  artillery officer had the best of the strategy and the shooting. He had  the most guns too.    Major Nichols was heard to remark the day after he had been through the  severe six gun barrage of the Reds who poured their wrath on the  Americans at 445 before they could but more than get slight shrapnel  shelters made, and had suffered four casualties, and the Royal Scots had  lost a fine Scotch lieutenant and two Russian soldiers. \"This shelling  of course would be small peanuts to the French and British soldiers who  were on the Western Front, but to us Americans fresh from the fields and  city offices and shops of Michigan it is a little hell.\" And so the  digging was good at 445 during the last of October and the first of  November while Major Nichols with \"M\" and \"I\" and French and American  machine gun sections held this front.    On the fourth of November \"I\" Company supported by the French machine  gunners sustained a terrific attack by the Reds in powerful force,  repulsed them finally after several hours, with great losses, and gained  from General Ironside a telegram of congratulations. \"I\" Co. lost one  killed, one missing, two wounded, one of which was Lieut. Reese. After  that big attack the enemy left us in possession and we began to fear  winter as much as we did the enemy. The only event that broke the  routine of patrols and artillery duels was the accidental bombing by our  Allied airplane of our position instead of the half-mile distant enemy  trenches, one of the two 112-lb. bombs taking the life of Floyd Sickles,  \"M\" Company's barber and wounding another soldier.    Amusing things also are recalled. The American medical officer at the  front line one morning looked at a French soldier who seemed to be  coming down with a heavy cold and generously doped him up with hot water  and whiskey. Next morning the whole machine gun section of French were  on sick call. But Collins was wise, and perhaps his bottle was empty.    One day a big, husky Yank in \"I\" Company was brokenly \"parlevooing\" with  a little French gunner, who was seen to leap excitedly into the air and  drape himself about the doughboy's neck exclaiming with joy, \"My son, my  son, my dear sister's son.\" This is the truth. And he took the Yank over  to his dugout for a celebration of this strange family meeting, filled  him up with sour wine, and his pockets with pictures of dancing girls.    Of course we were to learn to our discomfort and peril that winter was  the time chosen by Trotsky for his counter-offensive against the Allied  forces in the North. Of that winter campaign we shall tell in later  chapters. We leave the Americans now on the railroad associated with  their French comrades and 310th Engineers building blockhouses for  defense and quarters to keep warm.        III    RIVER PUSH FOR KOTLAS    First Battalion Hurries Up The River--We Take Chamova--The Lay Of The  River Land--Battling For Seltso--Retire To Yakovlevskoe--That Most  Wonderful Smoke--Incidents Of The March--Sudden Shift To Shenkursk  Area--The Battalion Splits--Again At Seltso--Bolos Attack--Edvyinson A  Hero.    That dismal, gloomy day--September 6, 1915--the first battalion, under  Lt.-Col. James Corbley, spent on board transport, watching the third  battalion disembark and getting on board the freight cars that were to  carry them down to the Railroad Front. Each man on board was aching to  set foot on dry land once more and would gladly have marched to any  front in order to avoid the dull monotony aboard ship, with nothing of  interest to view but the gleaming spires of the cathedrals or the cold,  gray northern sky, but there is an end to all such trials, and late that  evening we received word that our battalion was to embark on several  river barges to proceed up the Dvina River.    The following day all hands turned to bright and early and from early  dawn until late that afternoon every man that was able to stand, and  some that were not, were busily engaged in making up packs, issuing  ammunition and loading up the barges. By six o'clock that evening they  had marched on board the barges--some of the men in the first stages of  \"flu\" had to be assisted on board with their packs. These barges, as we  afterward learned, were a good example of the Russian idea of sanitation  and cleanliness. They had been previously used for hauling coal, cattle,  produce, flax, and a thousand-and-one other things, and in their years  of usage had accumulated an unbelievable amount of filth and dirt. In  addition to all this, they were leaky, and the lower holds, where  hundreds of men had to sleep that week, were cold, dismal and damp.  Small wonder that our little force was daily decreased by sickness and  death. After five days of this slow, monotonous means of travel, we  finally arrived at the town of Beresnik, which afterward became the base  for the river column troops.    The following day \"A\" Company, 339th Infantry, under Capt. Otto Odjard,  took over the defense of the village in order to relieve a detachment of  Royal Scots who were occupying the town. All that day we saw and heard  the dull roar of the artillery further up the river, where the Royal  Scots, accompanied by a gunboat, were attempting to drive the enemy  before them. Meeting with considerable opposition in the vicinity of  Chamova, a village about fifty versts from Beresnik, a rush call was  sent in for American reinforcements.    The first battalion of the 339th Infantry left Beresnik about September  15th under command of Major Corbley, and started up the Dvina. The first  incident worthy of record occurred at Chamova. As advance company we  arrived about 1:00 a. m. at Chamova, which was garrisoned by a small  force of Scots. We put out our outposts in the brush which surrounded  the town, and shortly afterward, about 5:00 a. m., we were alarmed by  the sound of musketry near the river bank. We deployed and advanced to  what seemed to be a small party from a gunboat. They had killed two  Scots who had mistaken them for a supply boat from Beresnik and gone to  meet them empty-handed. The Bolo had regained his boat after a little  firing between him and the second platoon which was at the upper end of  the village. We were trying to locate oars for the clumsy Russian  barzhaks on the bank, intending to cross to the island where the gunboat  was moored and do a little navy work, when the British monitor hove into  sight around a bend about three miles down stream, and opened fire on  the gunboat. The first shot was a little long, the second a little  short, and the third was a clean hit amid ship which set the gunboat on  fire. John Bolo in the meantime took a hasty departure by way of the  island. We were immensely disappointed by the advent of the monitor, as  the gunboat would have been very handy in navigating the Russian roads.    This Monitor, by the way, was much feared by the Russians, but was very  temperamental, and if it was sadly needed, as it was later at Toulgas  when we were badly outranged, it reposed calmly at Beresnik. When the  Monitor first made its advent on the Dvina she steamed into Beresnik,  and her commander inquired loftily, \"Where are the bloody Bolsheviks,  and which is the way to Kotlas?\" Upon being informed she steamed boldly  up the Dvina on the road to Kotlas, found the Bolo, who promptly slapped  a shell into their internal workings, killing several men and putting  the Monitor temporarily hors de combat. After that the Monitor was very  prudent and displayed no especial longing to visit Kotlas.    In order to better comprehend the situation and terrain of the river  forces, a few words regarding the two rivers and their surroundings will  not be without interest. This region is composed of vast tundras or  marshes and the balance of the entire province is covered with almost  impenetrable forests of pine and evergreen of different varieties. The  tundras or marshes are very treacherous, for the traveler marching along  on what appears to be a rough strip of solid ground, suddenly may feel  the same give way and he is precipitated into a bath of ice cold muddy  water. Great areas of these tundras are nothing more than a thickly  woven matting of grasses and weeds overgrowing creeks or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#8)"],[1," would  forever remain in a fallen state, and as to hope of eternal progression  would be inevitably lost.[64] The mortal probation is provided as an  opportunity for advancement; but so great are the difficulties and the  dangers, so strong is the influence of evil in the world, and so weak is  man in resistance thereto, that without the aid of a power above that of  humanity no soul would find its way back to God from whom it came. The  need of a Redeemer lies in the inability of man to raise himself from  the temporal to the spiritual plane, from the lower kingdom to the  higher. In this conception we are not without analogies in the natural  world. We recognize a fundamental distinction between inanimate and  living matter, between the inorganic and the organic, between the  lifeless mineral on the one hand and the living plant or animal on the  other. Within the limitations of its order the dead mineral grows by  accretion of substance, and may attain a relatively perfect condition of  structure and form as is seen in the crystal. But mineral matter, though  acted upon favorably by the forces of nature--light, heat, electric  energy and others--can never become a living organism; nor can the dead  elements, through any process of chemical combination dissociated from  life, enter into the tissues of the plant as essential parts thereof.  But the plant, which is of a higher order, sends its rootlets into the  earth, spreads its leaves in the atmosphere, and through these organs  absorbs the solutions of the soil, inspires the gases of the air, and  from such lifeless materials weaves the tissue of its wondrous  structure. No mineral particle, no dead chemical substance has ever been  made a constituent of organic tissue except through the agency of life.  We may, perhaps with profit, carry the analogy a step farther. The plant  is unable to advance its own tissue to the animal plane. Though it be  the recognized order of nature that the \"animal kingdom\" is dependent  upon the \"vegetable kingdom\" for its sustenance, the substance of the  plant may become part of the animal organism only as the latter reaches  down from its higher plane and by its own vital action incorporates the  vegetable compounds with itself. In turn, animal matter can never  become, even transitorily, part of a human body, except as the living  man assimilates it, and by the vital processes of his own existence  lifts, for the time being, the substance of the animal that supplied him  food to the higher plane of his own existence. The comparison herein  employed is admittedly defective if carried beyond reasonable limits of  application; for the raising of mineral matter to the plane of the  plant, vegetable tissue to the level of the animal, and the elevation of  either to the human plane, is but a temporary change; with the  dissolution of the higher tissues the material thereof falls again to  the level of the inanimate and the dead. But, as a means of illustration  the analogy may not be wholly without value.    So, for the advancement of man from his present fallen and relatively  degenerate state to the higher condition of spiritual life, a power  above his own must cooperate. Through the operation of the laws  obtaining in the higher kingdom man may be reached and lifted; himself  he cannot save by his own unaided effort.[65] A Redeemer and Savior of  mankind is beyond all question essential to the realization of the plan  of the Eternal Father, \"to bring to pass the immortality and eternal  life of man\";[66] and that Redeemer and Savior is Jesus the Christ,  beside whom there is and can be none other.      NOTES TO CHAPTER 3.    1. God's Foreknowledge Not a Determining Cause.--\"Respecting the  foreknowledge of God, let it not be said that divine omniscience is of  itself a determining cause whereby events are inevitably brought to  pass. A mortal father, who knows the weaknesses and frailties of his  son, may by reason of that knowledge sorrowfully predict the calamities  and sufferings awaiting his wayward boy. He may foresee in that son's  future a forfeiture of blessings that could have been won, loss of  position, self-respect, reputation and honor; even the dark shadows of a  felon's cell and the night of a drunkard's grave may appear in the  saddening visions of that fond father's soul; yet, convinced by  experience of the impossibility of bringing about that son's reform, he  foresees the dread developments of the future, and he finds but sorrow  and anguish in his knowledge. Can it be said that the father's  foreknowledge is a cause of the son's sinful life? The son, perchance,  has reached his maturity; he is the master of his own destiny; a free  agent unto himself. The father is powerless to control by force or to  direct by arbitrary command; and, while he would gladly make any effort  or sacrifice to save his son from the fate impending, he fears for what  seems to be an awful certainty. But surely that thoughtful, prayerful,  loving parent does not, because of his knowledge, contribute to the  son's waywardness. To reason otherwise would be to say that a neglectful  father, who takes not the trouble to study the nature and character of  his son, who shuts his eyes to sinful tendencies, and rests in careless  indifference as to the probable future, will by his very heartlessness  be benefitting his child, because his lack of forethought cannot operate  as a contributory cause to dereliction.    \"Our Heavenly Father has a full knowledge of the nature and disposition  of each of His children, a knowledge gained by long observation and  experience in the past eternity of our primeval childhood; a knowledge  compared with which that gained by earthly parents through mortal  experience with their children is infinitesimally small. By reason of  that surpassing knowledge, God reads the future of child and children,  of men individually and of men collectively as communities and nations;  He knows what each will do under given conditions, and sees the end from  the beginning. His foreknowledge is based on intelligence and reason. He  foresees the future as a state which naturally and surely will be; not  as one which must be because He has arbitrarily willed that it shall  be.\"--From the author's _Great Apostasy_, pp. 19, 20.    2. Man Free to Choose for Himself.--\"The Father of souls has endowed His  children with the divine birthright of free agency; He does not and will  not control them by arbitrary force; He impels no man toward sin; He  compels none to righteousness. Unto man has been given freedom to act  for himself; and, associated with this independence, is the fact of  strict responsibility and the assurance of individual accountability. In  the judgment with which we shall be judged, all the conditions and  circumstances of our lives shall be considered. The inborn tendencies  due to heredity, the effect of environment whether conducive to good or  evil, the wholesome teachings of youth, or the absence of good  instruction--these and all other contributory elements must be taken  into account in the rendering of a just verdict as to the soul's guilt  or innocence. Nevertheless, the divine wisdom makes plain what will be  the result with given conditions operating on known natures and  dispositions of men, while every individual is free to choose good or  evil within the limits of the many conditions existing and  operative.\"--_Great Apostasy_, p. 21; see also _Articles of Faith_,  iii:1, 2.    3. The Fall a Process of Physical Degeneracy.--A modern revelation given  to the Church in 1833 (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 89), prescribes rules for  right living, particularly as regards the uses of stimulants, narcotics,  and foods unsuited to the body. Concerning the physical causes by which  the fall was brought about, and the close relation between those causes  and current violations of the Word of Wisdom embodied in the revelation  referred to above, the following is in point. \"This, [the Word of  Wisdom] like other revelations that have come in the present  dispensation, is not wholly new. It is as old as the human race. The  principle of the Word of Wisdom was revealed unto Adam. All the  essentials of the Word of Wisdom were made known unto him in his  immortal state, before he had taken into his body those things that made  of it a thing of earth. He was warned against that very practise. He was  not told to treat his body as something to be tortured. He was not told  to look upon it as the fakir of India has come to look upon his body, or  professes to look upon it, as a thing to be utterly contemned; but he  was told that he must not take into that body certain things which were  there at hand. He was warned that, if he did, his body would lose the  power which it then held of living for ever, and that he would become  subject to death. It was pointed out to him, as it has been pointed out  to you, that there are many good fruits to be plucked, to be eaten, to  be enjoyed. We believe in enjoying good food. We think that these good  things are given us of God. We believe in getting all the enjoyment out  of eating that we can; and, therefore, we should avoid gluttony, and we  should avoid extremes in all our habits of eating; and as was told unto  Adam, so is it told unto us: Touch not these things; for in the day that  thou doest it thy life shall be shortened and thou shalt die.    \"Here let me say that therein consisted the fall--the eating of things  unfit, the taking into the body of the things that made of that body a  thing of earth: and I take this occasion to raise my voice against the  false interpretation of scripture, which has been adopted by certain  people, and is current in their minds, and is referred to in a hushed  and half-secret way, that the fall of man consisted in some offense  against the laws of chastity and of virtue. Such a doctrine is an  abomination. What right have we to turn the"]]]
