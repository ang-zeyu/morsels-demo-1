He's too fine a gentleman to wash in  the kitchen.\"    \"What did you tell him?\"    Mrs. Bickford repeated her remark.    \"Good for you, mother! We'll take down his pride a little.\"    \"Is he goin' to work in them fine clo'es he brought with him?\"    \"He didn't bring any others.\"    \"He'll spile 'em, and not have anything to wear to meetin'.\"    \"Haven't we got a pair of overalls in the house--one that the last boy  used?\"    \"Yes; I'll get 'em right away.\"    \"They'll be good for him to wear.\"    Before Kit got into bed, the door of his chamber was unceremoniously  opened, and Mrs. Bickford walked in, carrying a faded pair of overalls.    \"You can put these on in the mornin',\" she said. \"They'll keep your  clo'es clean. They may be a mite long for you, but you can turn up the  legs at the bottom.\"    She left the room without waiting for an answer.    Kit surveyed the overalls with amusement.    \"I wonder how I should look in them,\" he said to himself.    He drew them over his trousers, and regarded his figure as well as he  could in the little seven by nine glass that hung on the wall.    \"There is Kit, the young blacksmith!\" he said with a smile. \"On the  whole, I don't think it improves my appearance. I'll take them off, and  leave them for the next boy.\"    \"What did the boy say, mother?\" asked Mr. Bickford, upon his wife's  return.    \"He just took 'em; he didn't say anything.\"    \"I s'pose he's never worn overalls before,\" said the blacksmith. \"What  do you think he told me on the way over?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"He said he wasn't goin' to work for me at all. He didn't like the  blacksmith's trade.\"    \"Well, of all things!\"    \"I just told him he hadn't no choice in the matter, that me and his  uncle had arranged matters, and that I should hold him to the  contract.\"    \"I'm afraid he'll be dainty about his vittles. He didn't eat much  dinner.\"    \"Wait till he gets to work, mother. I guess he'll have appetite enough.  I mean he shall earn his board, at any rate.\"    \"I hope we won't have no trouble with him, Aaron.\"    \"You needn't be afraid, mother.\"    \"Somehow, Aaron, you never did manage to keep boys very long,\" said Mrs.  Bickford, dubiously.    \"Because their folks were weak, and allowed 'em to have their own way.  It'll be different with this boy.\"    \"What makes you think so?\"    \"Because his uncle is anxious to get rid of him. He told me the boy,  till lately, had imagined he was goin' to have property. He's supported  him out of charity, dressin' him like a gentleman, sendin' him to  school, and spendin' a pile of money on him. Now he thinks it about time  to quit, and have the boy learn a trade. Of course the boy'll complain,  and try to beg off, but it won't be no use. Stephen Watson won't make no  account of what he says. He keeps a horse himself, and has promised to  have him shod at my shop.\"    \"Well, it may be for the best; I hope so.\"    Aaron Bickford felt a good deal of confidence in himself. He understood  very well that Kit was averse to working in his shop, but he meant to  make him do it.    \"I'd like to see the boy I can't master,\" he said to himself,  complacently. \"Years hence, when the boy has a forge of his own, he'll  thank me for perseverin' with him. There's money to be made in the  business. Why, when I began I wasn't worth a hundred dollars, and I  owed for my anvil. Now I own this house and shop, and I've got a tidy  sum in the bank.\"    This was true. But it must be added that the result was largely due to  the pinching economy which both he and his wife had practiced.    When Mr. Bickford woke up the next morning it was half-past five  o'clock.    \"Strange how I came to oversleep,\" he said. \"I guess I must have been  more tuckered out than I supposed. Well, the boy's had a longer nap than  I meant he should. However, it's only for one mornin'.\"    Mr. Bickford did not linger over his toilet. Five minutes was rather an  overstatement of the time.    He went to Kit's chamber, and, opening the door, went in as  unceremoniously as his wife had done the night before.    A surprise awaited him.    There was no one in the bed.    \"What! has the boy got up a'ready?\" he asked himself, in a bewildered  way. \"He's better at gettin' up than I expected.\"    Looking about him, he discovered on a chair by the bedside the overalls,  and upon them a note and a silver dollar.    \"What's all that mean?\" he asked himself.    Looking closer he saw that the note was directed to him. Beginning to  suspect that something was wrong, he opened it.    This was what the note contained:         MR. BICKFORD--I leave you a dollar to pay for my food and lodging.       I do not care to become a blacksmith. Good by.                                                         KIT WATSON.    \"I'll have him back!\" exclaimed Aaron Bickford, an angry look appearing  on his face. \"He ain't goin' to get the best of me.\"    Mr. Bickford harnessed up his horse, and started after the fugitive. But  in what direction should he drive? He was not long at fault. He met a  milkman who had seen two boys starting out on the Grafton road, and so  informed him.    \"I guess they're bound for the circus,\" he said.    \"Like as not,\" returned the blacksmith.    But he had a long chase of it. It was not until he was within half a  mile of the circus tents that he descried the two boys, trudging along,  Kit with his valise in his hand. Hearing the sound of wheels, the boys  looked back, and in some dismay recognized their pursuer.    The blacksmith stood up in his wagon, and pointing his long whip at Kit,  cried out, \"Stop where you are, Kit Watson, or I'll give you the worst  thrashing you ever had!\"          CHAPTER XI.    KIT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.      If Aaron Bickford expected to frighten Kit by his threat, he was  destined to find himself badly mistaken.    Kit was startled at first, not having anticipated that the blacksmith  would get upon his track so soon. But he was a boy of spirit, and had no  thought of surrender. Mr. Bickford halted his horse, and Kit faced him.    \"Didn't you find my note?\" he asked.    \"Yes, I did.\"    \"Then you know that I don't care to work for you.\"    \"What's that got to do with it? Your uncle and me have settled that you  shall.\"    \"Then you'll have to unsettle it. I have a right to choose my own  occupation, and I don't intend to become a blacksmith. Even if I did, I  should choose some one else as my teacher.\"    \"None of your impudence, young man! You'll have a long account to settle  with me, I warn you of that.\"    \"I had but one account to settle--for my board and lodging--and I've  attended to that. Good morning, Mr. Bickford.\"    Kit turned and began to continue his journey.    \"Hallo! Stop, I tell you!\" shouted the blacksmith.    \"Have you got any more to say? If so, I'll listen.\"    \"What more I have to say, I shall say with a horsewhip!\" retorted  Bickford, grimly, preparing to descend from his wagon.    \"Come, William, we must run for it,\" said Kit. \"Are you good at  running?\"    \"Try me!\" was the laconic reply.    By the time Aaron Bickford was out of his wagon, the boys had increased  the distance between them by several rods.    \"Oho, so that's your game, is it?\" said the blacksmith. \"If I don't  overhaul them, my name isn't Aaron Bickford.\"    Kit was a good runner--quite as good as his pursuer--but he had one  serious disadvantage. His valise was heavy, and materially affected his  speed. He had carried it several miles, and though he had shifted it  from one hand to the other, both arms were now tired.    \"Let me take it, Kit,\" said his companion, who was now on intimate terms  with him.    \"It'll be just as heavy for you as for me.\"    \"Never mind! He isn't after me.\"    \"Well, if you don't mind carrying it a little while.\"    The advantage of the change was soon apparent. Kit increased his speed,  and William, whose arms were not tired, was not materially retarded by  his burden.    \"If I had no valise I would climb a tree,\" said Kit, while running. \"I  don't believe Mr. Bickford is good at climbing.\"    \"We haven't got far to go to reach the circus tents,\" returned William.    But though the boys held out well, Aaron Bickford gradually gained upon  them. Many years at the anvil had given him plenty of wind and  endurance. Besides, he was entirely fresh, not having taken a long walk  already, as the boys had done.    \"You'd better give up!\" he cried out, in the tone of one who was sure of  victory. \"It takes more than a boy like you to get the best of Aaron  Bickford.\"    It did indeed seem as if the boys must surrender. Within a few rods  Bickford would be even with them.    Kit came to a sudden determination.    \"Jump over the fence!\" he cried.    There was a rail fence skirting one side of the road.    No sooner said than done. Both boys clambered over the fence, and with  that barrier between them faced the angry blacksmith.    \"Well, I've got you!\" he cried, panting.    \"Have you? I don't see it,\" answered Kit.    \"You might as well give up fust as last.\"    \"Suppose we discuss matters a little, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, calmly.  \"What right have you to pursue me?\"    \"What right? Your uncle's given me the charge of you.\"    \"That is something he had no right to do.\"    \"Why not? Ain't he your guardian?\"    \"No.\"    \"Who is, then?\"    \"I have no guardian but myself.\"    \"That's a likely story. I can't listen to no such foolish talk.\"    Aaron Bickford felt that it was time to move upon the enemy's  entrenchments, and, putting one leg on the lower rail, he proceeded to  climb over the fence.    But the boys had anticipated this move, and were prepared for it. By the  time the blacksmith was inside the field, the boys, who were  considerably lighter and more active, had crossed to the reverse side.    \"Here we are again, Mr. Bickford,\" said William Morris.    The blacksmith frowned.    \"Don't you be impudent,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#8)"],[1," remember, we were reading _la Nuit d'Octobre_; she interrupted  me, to ask for something more serious! I tried then to explain to her  that there is nothing in the world more serious than poetry, which is  the very essence of life, floating above it like a glory of light,  in the % vibrations of which words and thoughts are elevated and  transfigured. Oh! what a disdainful smile passed over her pretty mouth  and what condescension in her glance! As though a child or a madman had  spoken to her.    What have I not thus wasted of strength and useless eloquence! Nothing  was of any use. I stumbled perpetually against what she called good  sense, reason, that eternal excuse of dried up hearts and narrow minds.  And it was not only poetry that bored her. Before our marriage, I had  believed her to be a musician. She seemed to understand the pieces  she played, aided by the underlinings of her teacher. Scarcely was she  married when she closed her piano, and gave up her music.    [Illustration: p099-110]    Can there be anything more melancholy than this abandonment by the young  wife of all that had pleased in the young girl? The reply given, the  part ended, the actress quits her costume. It was all done with a view  to marriage; a surface of petty accomplishments, of pretty smiles, and  fleeting elegance. With her the change was instantaneous. At first I  hoped that the taste I could not give her, an artistic intelligence and  love of the beautiful, would come to her in spite of herself, through  the medium of this wonderful Paris, with its unconscious refining  influence on eyes and mind. But what can be done with a woman who does  not know how to open a book, to look at a picture, who is always bored  and refuses to see anything? I soon understood that I must resign myself  to have by my side nothing but a housewife, active and economical,  indeed very economical. According to Proudhon, a woman, nothing more. I  could have shaped my course accordingly; so many artists are in the same  plight! But this modest role was not enough for her.    Little by little, slyly, silently, she managed to get rid of all my  friends. We had not made any difference in our talk because of * her  presence. We talked as we always had done in the past, but she never  understood the irony or the fantasy of our artistic exaggerations, of  our wild axioms, or paradoxes, in which-an idea is travestied only to  figure more brilliantly. It only irritated and puzzled her. Seated in  a quiet corner of the drawing-room, she listened and said nothing,  planning all the while how she should eliminate one by one those who  so much shocked her. Notwithstanding the seeming friendliness of the  welcome, there could already be felt in my rooms that thin current  of cold air, which warns that the door is open and that it is time to  leave.    My friends once gone, she replaced them by her own. I found myself  surrounded by an absurd set of worthies, strangers to art, who hated  poetry and scorned it because \"it made no money.\" On purpose the names  of fashionable writers who manufacture plays and novels by the dozen  were cited before me, with the remark: \"So and so makes a great deal of  money!\"    Make money! this is the all-important point for these creatures, and  I had the pain of seeing my wife think with them. In this fatal  atmosphere, her provincial habits, her mean and narrow views were made  still more odious by an incredible stinginess.    Fifteen thousand francs (six hundred pounds) a year! It seemed to me  that with this income we could live without fear of the morrow. Not  at all! She was always grumbling, talking of economy, reform, good  investments. As she overpowered me with these dull details, I felt all  desire and taste for work ebb away from me. Sometimes she came to  my table and scornfully turned over the scattered half-written  pages:--\"Only that!\" she would say, counting the hours lost upon the  insignificant little lines. Ah I if I had listened to her, my glorious  title of poet, which it has taken me so many years to win, would be now  dragged through the black mire of sensational literature. And when  I think that to this selfsame woman I had at first opened my heart,  confided all my dreams; and when I think that the contempt she now  shows me because I do not make money dates from the first days of our  marriage; I am indeed ashamed, both of myself and of her.    I make no money! That explains everything, the reproach of her glance,  her admiration for fruitful commonplaces, culminating in the steps she  took but lately to obtain for me I don't know what post in a government  office.    At this, however, I resisted. No defence remains to me but this, a force  of inertia, which yields to no assault, to no persuasion. She may speak  for hours, freeze me with her chilliest smile, my thought ever escapes  her, will always escape her. And we have come to this! Married and  condemned to live together, leagues of distance separate us; and we are  both too weary, too utterly discouraged, to care to make one step that  might draw us together. It is horrible!    [Illustration: p108-119]    [Illustration: p111-122]          ASSAULT WITH VIOLENCE.      MR. PETITBRY, Chamber Counsel.    _To Madame Nina de B., at her Aunt's house, in Moulins_.    Madame, conformably to the wishes of Madame your aunt, I have looked  into the matter in question. I have noted down one by one all the  different points and submitted your grievances to the most scrupulous  investigation. Well, on my soul and conscience, I do not find the  fruit ripe enough, or to speak plainly, I do not consider that you have  sufficient grounds to justify your petition for a judicial separation.  Let us not forget that the French law is a very downright kind of thing,  totally devoid of delicate feeling for nice distinctions. It recognizes  only acts, serious, brutal acts, and unfortunately it is these acts  we lack. Most assuredly I have been deeply touched while reading the  account of the first year of your married life, so very painful to you.  You have paid dearly for the glory of marrying a famous artist, one of  those men in whom fame and adulation develop monstrous egotism, and who  under penalty of shattering the frail and timid life that would attach  itself to theirs, must live alone. Ah! madame, since the commencement of  my career, how many wretched wives have I not beheld in the same cruel  position as yourself! Artists who live only by and for the public, carry  nothing home to their hearth but fatigue from glory, or the melancholy  of their disappointments. An ill-regulated existence, without compass  or rudder, subversive ideas contrary to all social conventionality,  contempt of family life and its happiness, cerebral excitement sought  for in the abuse of tobacco and strong drink, without mentioning  anything else, this constitutes the terrible artistic element from which  your dear Aunt is desirous of withdrawing you; but I must repeat, that  while I fully comprehend her anxiety, nay her remorse even at having  consented to such a marriage, I cannot see that matters have reached a  point calculated to warrant your petition.    I have, however, set down the outlines of a judicial memorandum, in  which your principal grievances are grouped and skilfully brought into  prominence. Here are the principal divisions of the work:    1 deg.. _Insulting conduct of Monsieur towards Madame's family_.--Refusal  to receive our Aunt from Moulins, who brought us up, and is tenderly  attached to us.--Nicknames such as _Tata Bobosse_, Fairy Carabossa,  and others, bestowed on that venerable old maid, whose back is slightly  bent.--Jests and quips, drawings in pen and pencil of the aforesaid and  her infirmity.    2 deg.. _Unsociableness_.--Refusal to see Ma-dame's friends, to make wedding  calls, to send cards, to answer invitations, etc.    3 deg.. _Wanton extravagance_.--Money lent without acknowledgment to all  kinds of Bohemians.--Open house and free quarters, turning the house  into an inn.--Constant subscriptions for statues, tombs, and productions  of unfortunate fellow artists.--Starting an artistic and literary  magazine!!!    4 deg.. _Insulting conduct to Madame_.--Having said out loud when alluding  to us: \"What a fool!\"    5 deg.. _Cruelty and violence_.--Excessive brutality on the part of  Monsieur.--Rage on the slightest pretext.--Breakage of china and  furniture.--Scandalous rows, offensive expressions.      All this, as you see, dear Madame, constitutes a somewhat respectable  amount of evidence, but is not however sufficient. We lack assault with  violence. Ah! if we had only an assault with violence, a tiny little  assault before witnesses, our case would be grand! But now that you have  put a hundred and fifty miles between your husband and yourself we can  scarcely hope for an incident of this kind. I say \"hope\" because in the  present state of affairs, a brutal act on the part of this man would be  the most fortunate thing that could befall you.    I remain, Madame, awaiting your commands, your devoted and obedient  servant,    Petitbry.    PS.--Violence before witnesses, of course!    [Illustration: p115-126]      _To Monsieur Petitbry, in Paris_.    What, Sir! have we come to such a pass as this! Is this what your laws  have made of antique French chivalry! So then, when a misunderstanding  is often sufficient to separate two hearts for ever, your law courts  require acts of violence to justify such a separation. Is it not  scandalous, unjust, barbarous, outrageous? To think that in order to  regain her freedom, my poor darling will be obliged to run her neck  into the halter, to abandon herself to all the fury of that monster,  to excite it even. But no matter, our mind is made up. An assault with  personal violence is necessary. Well! we will have it. No later than  to-morrow, Nina will return to Paris, How will she be received?
