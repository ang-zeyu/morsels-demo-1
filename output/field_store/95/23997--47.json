I am thus far of your minde (sayes _Carneades_) that the  _Aristotelians_ might with probability deduce a much greater number of  compound Bodies from the mixture of their four Elements, than  according to their present _Hypothesis_ they can, if instead of vainly  attempting to deduce the variety and properties of all mixt Bodies  from the Combinations and Temperaments of the four Elements, as they  are (among them) endowd with the four first Qualities, they had  endeavoured to do it by the Bulk and Figure of the smallest parts of  those supposed Elements. For from these more Catholick and Fruitfull  Accidents of the Elementary matter may spring a great variety of  Textures, upon whose Account a multitude of compound Bodies may very  much differ from one another. And what I now observe touching the four  Peripatetick Elements, may be also applyed, _mutatis mutandis_, (as  they speak) to the Chymical Principles. But (to take notice of that by  the by) both the one and the other, must, I fear, call in to their  assistance something that is not Elementary, to excite or regulate the  motion of the parts of the matter, and dispose them after the manner  requisite to the Constitution of particular Concretes. For that  otherwise they are like to give us but a very imperfect account of the  Origine of very many mixt Bodies, It would, I think, be no hard matter  to perswade you, if it would not spend time, and were no Digression,  to examine, what they are wont to alledge of the Origine of the  Textures and Qualities of mixt Bodies, from a certain substantial  Form, whose Origination they leave more obscure than what it is  assum'd to explicate.    But to proceed to a new Proposition.    [Sidenote: Propos. III.]    _I shall not peremptorily deny, that from most of such mixt Bodies as  partake either of Animal or Vegetable Nature, there may by the Help of  the Fire, be actually obtain'd a determinate number (whether Three,  Four or Five, or fewer or more) of Substances, worthy of differing  Denominations._    Of the Experiments that induce me to make this Concession, I am like  to have occasion enough to mention several in the prosecution of my  Discourse. And therefore, that I may not hereafter be oblig'd to  trouble You and my self with needless Repetitions, I shall now only  desire you to take notice of such Experiments, when they shall be  mention'd, and in your thoughts referre them hither.    To these three Concessions I have but this Fourth to add, That    [Sidenote: Propos. IV.]    _It may likewise be granted, that those distinct Substances, which  Concretes generally either afford or are made up of, may without very  much Inconvenience be call'd the Elements or Principles of them._    When I said, _without very much Inconvenience_, I had in my Thoughts  that sober Admonition of _Galen_, _Cum de re constat, de verbis non  est Litigandum_. And therefore also I scruple not to say _Elements_ or  _Principles_, partly because the Chymists are wont to call the  Ingredients of mixt Bodies, _Principles_, as the _Aristotelians_ name  them _Elements_; I would here exclude neither. And, partly, because it  seems doubtfull whether the same Ingredients may not be call'd  _Principles_? as not being compounded of any more primary Bodies: and  _Elements_, in regard that all mix'd Bodies are compounded of them.  But I thought it requisite to limit my Concession by premising the  words, _very much_, to the word _Inconvenience_, because that though  the Inconvenience of calling the distinct Substances, mention'd in the  Proposition _Elements_ or _Principles_, be not very great, yet that  it is an Impropriety of Speech, and consequently in a matter of this  moment not to be altogether overlook'd, You will perhaps think, as  well as I, by that time you shall have heard the following part of my  Discourse, by which you will best discern what Construction to put  upon the former Propositions, and how far they may be look'd upon, as  things that I concede as true, and how far as things I only represent  as specious enough to be fit to be consider'd.    And now _Eleutherius_ (continues _Carneades_) I must resume the person  of a Sceptick, and as such, propose some part of what may be either  dislik't, or at least doubted of in the common _Hypothesis_ of the  Chymists: which if I examine with a little the more freedom, I hope I  need not desire you (a Person to whom I have the Happinesse of being  so well known) to look upon it as something more suitable to the  Employment whereto the Company has, for this Meeting, doom'd me; then  either to my Humour or my Custom.    Now though I might present you many things against the Vulgar Chymical  Opinion of the three Principles, and the Experiments wont to be  alledg'd as Demonstrations of it, yet those I shall at present offer  you may be conveniently enough comprehended in four Capital  Considerations; touching all which I shall only premise this in  general, That since it is not my present Task so much to assert an  _Hypothesis_ of my own, as to give an Account wherefore I suspect the  Truth of that of the Chymists, it ought not to be expected that all my  Objections should be of the most cogent sort, since it is reason  enough to Doubt of a propos'd Opinion, that there appears no cogent  Reason for it.    To come then to the Objections themselves; I consider in the first  place, That notwithstanding what common Chymists have prov'd or  taught, it may reasonably enough be Doubted, how far, and in what  sence, Fire ought to be esteem'd the genuine and universal Instrument  of analyzing mixt Bodies.    This Doubt, you may remember, was formerly mention'd, but so  transiently discours'd of, that it will now be fit to insist upon it;  And manifest that it was not so inconsiderately propos'd as our  Adversaries then imagin'd.    But, before I enter any farther into this Disquisition, I cannot but  here take notice, that it were to be wish'd, our Chymists had clearly  inform'd us what kinde of Division of Bodies by Fire must determine  the number of the Elements: For it is nothing near so easy as many  seem to think, to determine distinctly the Effects of Heat, as I could  easily manifest, if I had leasure to shew you how much the Operations  of Fire may be diversify'd by Circumstances. But not wholly to pass by  a matter of this Importance, I will first take notice to you, that  _Guajacum_ (for Instance) burnt with an open Fire in a Chimney, is  sequestred into Ashes and Soot, whereas the same Wood distill'd in a  Retort does yield far other Heterogeneities, (to use the _Helmontian_  expression) and is resolv'd into Oyl, Spirit, Vinager, Water and  Charcoal; the last of which to be reduc'd into Ashes, requires the  being farther calcin'd then it can be in a close Vessel: Besides  having kindled Amber, and held a clean Silver Spoon, or some other  Concave and smooth Vessel over the Smoak of its Flame, I observ'd the  Soot into which that Fume condens'd, to be very differing from any  thing that I had observ'd to proceed from the steam of Amber purposely  (for that is not usual) distilled _per se_ in close Vessels. Thus  having, for Tryals sake, kindled Camphire, and catcht the Smoak that  copiously ascended out of the Flame, it condens'd into a Black and  unctuous Soot, which would not have been guess'd by the Smell or other  Properties to have proceeded from Camphire: whereas having (as I shall  otherwhere more fully declare) expos'd a quantity of that Fugitive  Concrete to a gentle heat in a close Glass-Vessel, it sublim'd up  without seeming to have lost any thing of its whiteness, or its  Nature, both which it retain'd, though afterwards I so encreased the  Fire as to bring it to Fusion. And, besides Camphire, there are divers  other Bodies (that I elsewhere name) in which the heat in close  Vessels is not wont to make any separation of Heterogeneities, but  only a comminution of Parts, those that rise first being Homogeneal  with the others, though subdivided into smaller Particles: whence  Sublimations have been stiled, _The Pestles of the Chymists_. But not  here to mention what I elsewhere take notice of, concerning common  Brimstone once or twice sublim'd, that expos'd to a moderate Fire in  Subliming-Pots, it rises all into dry, and almost tastless, Flowers;  Whereas being expos'd to a naked Fire it affords store of a Saline and  Fretting Liquor: Not to mention this, I say, I will further observe to  you, that as it is considerable in the _Analysis_ of mixt Bodies,  whether the Fire act on them when they are expos'd to the open Air, or  shut up in close Vessels, so is the degree of Fire by which the  _Analysis_ is attempted of no small moment. For a milde _Balneum_ will  sever unfermented Blood (for Instance) but into Phlegme and _Caput  mortuum_, the later whereof (which I have sometimes had) hard,  brittle, and of divers Colours, (transparent almost like  Tortoise-shell) press'd by a good Fire in a Retort yields a Spirit, an  Oyl or two, and a volatile Salt, besides a [Errata: another] _Caput  mortuum_. It may be also pertinent to our present Designe, to take  notice of what happens in the making and distilling of Sope; for by  one degree of Fire the Salt, the Water and the Oyl or Grease, whereof  that factitious Concrete is made up, being boyl'd up together are  easily brought to mingle and incorporate into one Mass; but by another  and further degree of Heat the same Mass may be again divided into an  oleagenous, an aqueous, a Saline, and an Earthy part. And so we may  observe that impure Silver and Lead being expos'd together to a  moderate Fire, will thereby be colliquated into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#8)"],[1,"moment.    Besides the books he had at hand, he borrowed all he could get, often  walking many miles for a book, until, as he once told a friend, he \"read  through every book he had ever heard of in that country, for a circuit  of fifty miles\"--quite a circulating library!      \"THE BEGINNING OF LOVE\"    \"The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\" It must have been about  this time that the lad had the following experience, which he himself  related to a legal friend, with his chair tilted back and his knees  \"cocked up\" in the manner described by Cousin John Hanks:    \"Did you ever write out a story in your mind? I did when I was little  codger. One day a wagon with a lady and two girls and a man broke down  near us, and while they were fixing up, they cooked in our kitchen. The  woman had books and read us stories, and they were the first of the kind  I ever heard. I took a great fancy to one of the girls; and when they  were gone I thought of her a good deal, and one day, when I was sitting  out in the sun by the house, I wrote out a story in my mind.    \"I thought I took my father's horse and followed the wagon, and finally  I found it, and they were surprised to see me.    \"I talked with the girl and persuaded her to elope with me; and that  night I put her on my horse and we started off across the prairie. After  several hours we came to a camp; and when we rode up we found it was one  we had left a few hours before and went in.    \"The next night we tried again, and the same thing happened--the horse  came back to the same place; and then we concluded we ought not to  elope. I stayed until I had persuaded her father that he ought to give  her to me.    \"I always meant to write that story out and publish it, and I began  once; but I concluded it was not much of a story.    \"But I think that was the beginning of love with me.\"      HOW ABE CAME TO OWN WEEMS'S \"LIFE OF WASHINGTON\"    Abe's chief delight, if permitted to do so, was to lie in the shade of  some inviting tree and read. He liked to lie on his stomach before the  fire at night, and often read as long as this flickering light lasted.  He sometimes took a book to bed to read as soon as the morning light  began to come through the chinks between the logs beside his bed. He  once placed a book between the logs to have it handy in the morning, and  a storm came up and soaked it with dirty water from the \"mud-daubed\"  mortar, plastered between the logs of the cabin.    The book happened to be Weems's \"Life of Washington.\" Abe was in a sad  dilemma. What could he say to the owner of the book, which he had  borrowed from the meanest man in the neighborhood, Josiah Crawford, who  was so unpopular that he went by the nickname of \"Old Blue Nose\"?    The only course was to show the angry owner his precious volume, warped  and stained as it was, and offer to do anything he could to repay him.    \"Abe,\" said \"Old Blue Nose,\" with bloodcurdling friendliness, \"bein' as  it's you, Abe, I won't be hard on you. You jest come over and pull  fodder for me, and the book is yours.\"    \"All right,\" said Abe, his deep-set eyes twinkling in spite of himself  at the thought of owning the story of the life of the greatest of  heroes, \"how much fodder?\"    \"Wal,\" said old Josiah, \"that book's worth seventy-five cents, at least.  You kin earn twenty-five cents a day--that will make three days. You  come and pull all you can in three days and you may have the book.\"    That was an exorbitant price, even if the book were new, but Abe was at  the old man's mercy. He realized this, and made the best of a bad  bargain. He cheerfully did the work for a man who was mean enough to  take advantage of his misfortune. He comforted himself with the thought  that he would be the owner of the precious \"Life of Washington.\" Long  afterward, in a speech before the New Jersey Legislature, on his way to  Washington to be inaugurated, like Washington, as President of the  United States, he referred to this strange book.      \"THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH\"    One morning, on his way to work, with an ax on his shoulder, his  stepsister, Matilda Johnston, though forbidden by her mother to follow  Abe, crept after him, and with a cat-like spring landed between his  shoulders and pressed her sharp knees into the small of his back.    Taken unawares, Abe staggered backward and ax and girl fell to the  ground together. The sharp implement cut her ankle badly, and  mischievous Matilda shrieked with fright and pain when she saw the blood  gushing from the wound. Young Lincoln tore a sleeve from his shirt to  bandage the gash and bound up the ankle as well as he could. Then he  tried to teach the still sobbing girl a lesson.    \"'Tilda,\" he said gently, \"I'm surprised. Why did you disobey mother?\"    Matilda only wept silently, and the lad went on, \"What are you going to  tell mother about it?\"    \"Tell her I did it with the ax,\" sobbed the young girl. \"That will be  the truth, too.\"    \"Yes,\" said Abe severely, \"that's the truth, but not _all_ the truth.  You just tell the whole truth, 'Tilda, and trust mother for the rest.\"    Matilda went limping home and told her mother the whole story, and the  good woman was so sorry for her that, as the girl told Abe that evening,  \"she didn't even scold me.\"      \"BOUNDING A THOUGHT--NORTH, SOUTH, EAST AND WEST\"    Abe sometimes heard things in the simple conversation of friends that  disturbed him because they seemed beyond his comprehension. He said of  this:    \"I remember how, when a child, I used to get irritated when any one  talked to me in a way I couldn't understand.    \"I do not think I ever got angry with anything else in my life; but that  always disturbed my temper--and has ever since.    \"I can remember going to my little bedroom, after hearing the neighbors  talk of an evening with my father, and spending no small part of the  night walking up and down, trying to make out what was the exact  meaning of some of their, to me, dark sayings.    \"I could not sleep, although I tried to, when I got on such a hunt for  an idea; and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied until I  had repeated it over and over, and had put in language plain enough, as  I thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend.    \"This was a kind of a passion with me, and it has stuck by me; for I am  never easy now when I am bounding a thought, till I have bounded it  east, and bounded it west, and bounded it north, and bounded it south.\"      HIGH PRAISE FROM HIS STEPMOTHER    Not long before her death, Mr. Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, called  upon Mrs. Sarah Lincoln to collect material for a \"Life of Lincoln\" he  was preparing to write. This was the best of all the things she related  of her illustrious stepson:    \"I can say what scarcely one mother in a thousand can say, Abe never  gave me a cross word or look, and never refused, in fact or appearance,  to do anything I asked him. His mind and mine seemed to run together.    \"I had a son, John, who was raised with Abe. Both were good boys, but I  must say, both now being dead, that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or  expect to see.\"    \"Charity begins at home\"--and so do truth and honesty. Abraham Lincoln  could not have become so popular all over the world on account of his  honest kindheartedness if he had not been loyal, obedient and loving  toward those at home. Popularity, also, \"begins at home.\" A mean,  disagreeable, dishonest boy may become a king, because he was \"to the  manner born.\" But only a good, kind, honest man, considerate of others,  can be elected President of the United States.          CHAPTER VII    ABE AND THE NEIGHBORS      \"PREACHING\" AGAINST CRUELTY TO ANIMALS    Nat Grigsby stated once that writing compositions was not required by  Schoolmaster Crawford, but \"Abe took it up on his own account,\" and his  first essay was against cruelty to animals.    The boys of the neighborhood made a practice of catching terrapins and  laying live coals on their backs. Abe caught a group of them at this  cruel sport one day, and rushed to the relief of the helpless turtle.  Snatching the shingle that one of the boys was using to handle the  coals, he brushed them off the turtle's shell, and with angry tears in  his eyes, proceeded to use it on one of the offenders, while he called  the rest a lot of cowards.    One day his stepbrother, John Johnston, according to his sister Matilda,  \"caught a terrapin, brought it to the place where Abe was 'preaching,'  threw it against a tree and crushed its shell.\" Abe then preached  against cruelty to animals, contending that \"an ant's life is as sweet  to it as ours is to us.\"      ROUGHLY DISCIPLINED FOR BEING \"FORWARD\"    Abe was compelled to leave school on the slightest pretext to work for  the neighbors. He was so big and strong--attaining his full height at  seventeen--that his services were more in demand than those of his  stepbrother, John Johnston, or of Cousin Dennis. Abe was called lazy  because the neighbors shared the idea of Thomas Lincoln, that his  reading and studying were only a pretext for shirking. Yet he was never  so idle as either Dennis Hanks or John Johnston, who were permitted to  go hunting or fishing with Tom Lincoln, while Abe stayed out of school  to do the work that one of the three older men should have done.    Abe's father was kinder in many ways to his stepchildren than he was to  his own son. This may have been due to the fact that he did not wish to  be thought \"partial\" to his own child. No doubt Abe was \"forward.\" He  liked to take part in any discussion, and sometimes he broke into the  conversation when his opinion had not been asked. Besides, he got into  arguments with his fellow-laborers, and wasted the time belonging to his  employer.    One day, according to Dennis, they were all working together in the  field, when a man rode up on horseback and asked a question. Abe was the  first to mount the"]]]
