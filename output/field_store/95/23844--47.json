Yet this little set of \"artistic\" habits all arise from most  logical causes and have become habits from their fitness to the  personality of their owner and their special value in enabling that  singer to do his best work by their aid. For instance, a singer will  know from trials and experience just the proper position of the tongue  and larynx to produce most effectively a certain note on the scale, yet  he will have come by this knowledge not by theory and reasoning, but  simply oft repeated attempts, and the knowledge he has come by will be  valuable to him only, for somebody else would produce the same note  equally well, but in quite a different way.    So one may see that there are actually as many methods as there are  singers, and any particular method, even if accurately set forth, might  be useless to the person who tried it. This is what I really would reply  to anyone putting this question to me--that my own particular way of  singing, if I have any, is, after all, peculiarly suited to me only, as  I have above described.    However, there are many interesting and valuable things to be said about  the voice in a general way.    Speaking first of the classification of voices, many young singers are  put much in doubt and dilemma because they are unable to determine what  sort of voice they really possess, whether soprano, mezzo or contralto.  Of course, it is easy enough to distinguish between the extremes of  these, between a \"real\" tenor and a low bass, but the difference between  a high baritone and tenor is rather more difficult to discern, and a  young man studying has often been at great disadvantage by imagining,  for instance, that he had a tenor voice and trying constantly to sing  music too high for him, since he in reality had only a high baritone.    In the course of development a voice very often increases its range and  changes its quality sufficiently to pass from a baritone to a tenor, and  it is sometimes a problem to place it during the transition process.  Perhaps the surest way to determine the real character of a voice is to  see on what notes words can be most easily pronounced. For the average  tenor the notes up to A above middle C, for the baritone, D above middle  C, and for the bass up to middle C itself, can be pronounced on the  best.    One should never try to change the tessitura, or natural character of  the voice. A voice will become higher just when it should by the  development due to rational work and never by forcing it. Nothing is  easier than to force a voice upward or downward, but to cause it to  \"recede,\" as it were, in either direction, is another matter. A  baritone who tries to increase his upper range by main strength will  surely in time lose his best lower notes, and a light tenor who attempts  to force out notes lower than his range will never be able to sing  legitimate tenor roles, and after two or three years may not be able to  sing at all.    It may be well to speak now of a very important point in singing--what  is called the \"attack\" of the tone. In general this may be described as  the relative position of the throat and tongue and the quality of voice  as the tone is begun. The most serious fault of many singers is that  they attack the tone either from the chest or the throat. Even with  robust health the finest voice cannot resist this. This is the reason  one sees so many artists who have made a brilliant debut disappear from  sight very soon or wind up later on a mediocre career. Singers who use  their voices properly should be at the height of their talents at  forty-five and keep their voices in full strength and virility up to at  least fifty. At this latter age, or close after it, it would seem well  to have earned the right to close one's career.    A great artist ought to have the dignity to say farewell to his public  when still in full possession of his powers and never let the world  apprise him of his falling off.    To have the attack true and pure one must consciously try to open the  throat not only in front, but from behind, for the throat is the door  through which the voice must pass, and if it is not sufficiently open it  is useless to attempt to get out a full, round one; also the throat is  the outlet and inlet for the breath, and if it is closed the voice will  seek other channels or return quenched within.    It must not be imagined that to open the mouth wide will do the same  for the throat. If one is well versed in the art, one can open the  throat perfectly without a perceptible opening of the mouth, merely by  the power of respiration.    It is necessary to open the sides of the mouth, at the same time  dropping the chin well, to obtain good throat opening. In taking higher  notes, of course, one must open the mouth a little wider, but for the  most part the position of the mouth is that assumed when smiling. It is  a good idea to practice opening the throat before a mirror and try to  see the palate, as when you show your throat to a doctor.    In pronouncing the sound \"ah\" one must always attack it in the back part  of the throat, taking care, however, before uttering the syllable, to  have the throat well open; otherwise what is called \"stroke of the  glottis\" occurs and the tone formed is hard and disagreeable. If you  ever hear this stroke of glottis on the attack, you may know that the  singer did not attack far enough back in the throat.    The tone once launched, one must think how it may be properly sustained,  and this is where the art of breathing is most concerned. The lungs, in  the first place, should be thoroughly filled. A tone begun with only  half filled lungs loses half its authority and is very apt to be false  in pitch. To take a full breath properly, the chest must be raised at  the same moment the abdomen sinks in. Then with the gradual expulsion of  the breath a contrary movement takes place. The diaphragm and elastic  tissue surrounding and containing the stomach and vital organs and the  muscles surrounding, by practice acquire great strength and assist  considerably in this process of respiration and are vital factors in  the matter of controlling the supply which supports the tone. The  diaphragm is really like a pair of bellows and serves exactly the same  purpose. It is this ability to take in an adequate supply of breath and  to retain it until required that makes or, by contrary, mars all  singing. A singer with a perfect sense of pitch and all the good  intentions possible will often sing off the key and bring forth a tone  with no vitality to it, distressing to hear, simply for lack of breath  control.    This art of respiration once acquired, the student has gone a  considerable step on the road to Parnassus.    To practice deep breathing effectively it is an excellent plan to  breathe through the nose, which aids in keeping the confined breath from  escaping too soon. The nose also warms and filters the air, making it  much more agreeable to the lungs than if taken directly through the  mouth. In the practice of slow breathing make sure that the lungs are as  nearly emptied as possible on the expulsion of the breath before  beginning a new inspiration, as this gives extra impetus to the fresh  supply of air and strengthens all the breathing muscles.    If this is not done, moreover, the effect is like two people trying to  get in and out of the same narrow door at the same time.    The voice is naturally divided into three registers--the chest, medium  and head. In a man's voice of lower quality this last is known as  \"falsetto,\" but in the case of a tenor he may use a tone which in sound  is almost falsetto, but is really a mezza voce, or half voice. This  latter legitimately belongs to a man's compass; a falsetto does not. The  most important register is the medium, particularly of tenors, for this  includes the greater part of the tenor's voice and can be utilized even  to the top of his range if rightly produced.    In the matter of taking high notes one should remember that their purity  and ease of production depend very much on the way the preceding notes  leading up to them are sung. Beginning in the lower register and  attacking the ascending notes well back, a balance must be maintained  all the way up, so that the highest note receives the benefit and  support of the original position of the throat, and there is no danger,  consequently, of the throat closing and pinching the quality of the top  notes.    Singers, especially tenors, are very apt to throw the head forward in  producing the high notes, and consequently get that throaty, strained  voice which is so disagreeable. To avoid this one should try to keep the  supply of breath down as far toward the abdomen as possible, thus  maintaining the upper passages to the head quite free for the emission  of the voice. Remember also to sing within yourself, as it were--to feel  the tones all through your being; otherwise your singing will possess no  sentiment, emotion or authority. It is the failure to accomplish this  which has produced so many soulless artists--singers endowed with  magnificent voices, capable of surmounting every technical difficulty,  but devoid of that charm of intonation which is so vital to success on  the operatic stage.          Faults to be Corrected      I have previously mentioned mezza voce and will now say a word on this  subject, for the artistic use of the \"half voice\" is a very valuable  adjunct in all singing. It may be defined simply as the natural voice  produced softly, but with an extra strength of breath. It is this  breathy quality, however--which one must be careful never to exaggerate  or the tone will not carry--that gives that velvety effect to the tone  that is so delightful.    Mezza voce is just a concentration of the full voice, and it requires,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#8)"],[1,"ation; but at the period when the frame is just  beginning to set, and when the Medical Board has reported that recovery  is improbable, I would suggest that the Irregular offspring be  painlessly and mercifully consumed.          Section 8.  Of the Ancient Practice of Painting        If my Readers have followed me with any attention up to this point,  they will not be surprised to hear that life is somewhat dull in  Flatland.  I do not, of course, mean that there are not battles,  conspiracies, tumults, factions, and all those other phenomena which  are supposed to make History interesting; nor would I deny that the  strange mixture of the problems of life and the problems of  Mathematics, continually inducing conjecture and giving the opportunity  of immediate verification, imparts to our existence a zest which you in  Spaceland can hardly comprehend.  I speak now from the aesthetic and  artistic point of view when I say that life with us is dull;  aesthetically and artistically, very dull indeed.    How can it be otherwise, when all one's prospect, all one's landscapes,  historical pieces, portraits, flowers, still life, are nothing but a  single line, with no varieties except degrees of brightness and  obscurity?    It was not always thus.  Colour, if Tradition speaks the truth, once  for the space of half a dozen centuries or more, threw a transient  splendour over the lives of our ancestors in the remotest ages.  Some  private individual--a Pentagon whose name is variously reported--having  casually discovered the constituents of the simpler colours and a  rudimentary method of painting, is said to have begun decorating first  his house, then his slaves, then his Father, his Sons, and Grandsons,  lastly himself.  The convenience as well as the beauty of the results  commended themselves to all.  Wherever Chromatistes,--for by that name  the most trustworthy authorities concur in calling him,--turned his  variegated frame, there he at once excited attention, and attracted  respect.  No one now needed to \"feel\" him; no one mistook his front for  his back; all his movements were readily ascertained by his neighbours  without the slightest strain on their powers of calculation; no one  jostled him, or failed to make way for him; his voice was saved the  labour of that exhausting utterance by which we colourless Squares and  Pentagons are often forced to proclaim our individuality when we move  amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles.    The fashion spread like wildfire.  Before a week was over, every Square  and Triangle in the district had copied the example of Chromatistes,  and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out.  A  month or two found even the Dodecagons infected with the innovation.  A  year had not elapsed before the habit had spread to all but the very  highest of the Nobility.  Needless to say, the custom soon made its way  from the district of Chromatistes to surrounding regions; and within  two generations no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women  and the Priests.    Here Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier, and to plead against  extending the innovation to these two classes.  Many-sidedness was  almost essential as a pretext for the Innovators.  \"Distinction of  sides is intended by Nature to imply distinction of colours\"--such was  the sophism which in those days flew from mouth to mouth, converting  whole towns at a time to the new culture.  But manifestly to our  Priests and Women this adage did not apply.  The latter had only one  side, and therefore--plurally and pedantically speaking--NO SIDES.  The  former--if at least they would assert their claim to be really and  truly Circles, and not mere high-class Polygons with an infinitely  large number of infinitesimally small sides--were in the habit of  boasting (what Women confessed and deplored) that they also had no  sides, being blessed with a perimeter of one line, or, in other words,  a Circumference.  Hence it came to pass that these two Classes could  see no force in the so-called axiom about \"Distinction of Sides  implying Distinction of Colour\"; and when all others had succumbed to  the fascinations of corporal decoration, the Priests and the Women  alone still remained pure from the pollution of paint.    Immoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific--call them by what names  you will--yet, from an aesthetic point of view, those ancient days of  the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland--a  childhood, alas, that never ripened into manhood, nor even reached the  blossom of youth.  To live was then in itself a delight, because living  implied seeing.  Even at a small party, the company was a pleasure to  behold; the richly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre  are said to have more than once proved too distracting for our greatest  teachers and actors; but most ravishing of all is said to have been the  unspeakable magnificence of a military review.    The sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly  facing about, and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for the  orange and purple of the two sides including their acute angle; the  militia of the Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red, white, and  blue; the mauve, ultra-marine, gamboge, and burnt umber of the Square  artillerymen rapidly rotating near their vermilion guns; the dashing  and flashing of the five-coloured and six-coloured Pentagons and  Hexagons careering across the field in their offices of surgeons,  geometricians and aides-de-camp--all these may well have been  sufficient to render credible the famous story how an illustrious  Circle, overcome by the artistic beauty of the forces under his  command, threw aside his marshal's baton and his royal crown,  exclaiming that he henceforth exchanged them for the artist's pencil.  How great and glorious the sensuous development of these days must have  been is in part indicated by the very language and vocabulary of the  period.  The commonest utterances of the commonest citizens in the time  of the Colour Revolt seem to have been suffused with a richer tinge of  word or thought; and to that era we are even now indebted for our  finest poetry and for whatever rhythm still remains in the more  scientific utterance of these modern days.          Section 9.  Of the Universal Colour Bill        But meanwhile the intellectual Arts were fast decaying.    The Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was no longer  practised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other  kindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous, and fell into  disrespect and neglect even at our University.  The inferior Art of  Feeling speedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools.  Then the Isosceles classes, asserting that the Specimens were no longer  used nor needed, and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the  Criminal classes to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous  and more insolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden  which had formerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once  taming their brutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers.    Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to  assert--and with increasing truth--that there was no great difference  between them and the very highest class of Polygons, now that they were  raised to an equality with the latter, and enabled to grapple with all  the difficulties and solve all the problems of life, whether Statical  or Kinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition.  Not content  with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling, they  began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all \"monopolizing and  aristocratic Arts\" and the consequent abolition of all endowments for  the studies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling.  Soon, they  began to insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was a second Nature, had  destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow  in the same path, and that henceforth all individuals and all classes  should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.    Finding the higher Orders wavering and undecided, the leaders of the  Revolution advanced still further in their requirements, and at last  demanded that all classes alike, the Priests and the Women not  excepted, should do homage to Colour by submitting to be painted.  When  it was objected that Priests and Women had no sides, they retorted that  Nature and Expediency concurred in dictating that the front half of  every human being (that is to say, the half containing his eye and  mouth) should be distinguishable from his hinder half.  They therefore  brought before a general and extraordinary Assembly of all the States  of Flatland a Bill proposing that in every Woman the half containing  the eye and mouth should be coloured red, and the other half green.  The Priests were to be painted in the same way, red being applied to  that semicircle in which the eye and mouth formed the middle point;  while the other or hinder semicircle was to be coloured green.    There was no little cunning in this proposal, which indeed emanated not  from any Isosceles--for no being so degraded would have had angularity  enough to appreciate, much less to devise, such a model of  state-craft--but from an Irregular Circle who, instead of being  destroyed in his childhood, was reserved by a foolish indulgence to  bring desolation on his country and destruction on myriads of his  followers.    On the one hand the proposition was calculated to bring the Women in  all classes over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation.  For by  assigning to the Women the same two colours as were assigned to the  Priests, the Revolutionists thereby ensured that, in certain positions,  every Woman would appear like a Priest, and be treated with  corresponding respect and"]]]
