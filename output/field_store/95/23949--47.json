His overwrought nerves being temporarily relieved by the  cachinnation, he regained for a few minutes some measure of composure  and sanity. With the return of reason came a returning sense of  injustice and oppression. He made a brief but ineffectual attempt to  argue the matter with the Chief Justice, who informed him that the facts  had been dealt with by the jury, and that he could be permitted to speak  only on questions of law. The sentence of the Court was then pronounced.  It was to the effect that the prisoner must quit the Province within  twenty-four hours. He was reminded of the risk he would run in the event  of his presuming to disobey, or to return to Upper Canada after his  departure therefrom. He would be liable, according to the words of the  Act of 1804, to suffer death as a felon, without benefit of clergy. The  Chief Justice finally proceeded to read him a severe lecture upon his  past course since his arrival in Canada, and furthermore to give him  some excellent advice. He informed him that in this country the law is  supreme; that no man can be permitted to run counter to it with  impunity; that those who administer the law should be no respecters of  persons; that justice is even-handed, and metes out impartially to the  poor man and the rich. He advised him to turn his great abilities to  practical account, whereby he would no doubt win happiness and  distinction. \"Perhaps,\" says George Eliot, \"some of the most terrible  irony of the human lot is to hear a deep truth uttered by lips that have  no right to it.\" Poor Gourlay was conscious of some feeling of this sort  when he heard such truths proclaimed from such lips. To his  morbidly-sensitive nature, such irony seemed an aggravation of all he  had endured. To think that, after such experiences as had fallen to his  share, a Family Compact judge should gravely inform him that in Upper  Canada the administrators of the law should be no respecters of persons!  that justice is even-handed! To think that such an one should presume to  advise him to become practical, with a view to wealth and happiness! It  was like the adulterous woman who, on eloping with her paramour, wrote  to her husband enjoining him to be virtuous if he would be happy. The  incongruity struck the prisoner so forcibly that for a moment he was on  the verge of another explosion of sardonic laughter. Before leaving the  dock he made one last attempt to draw attention to the treatment he had  sustained while in prison. By way of heightening the effect of his  narration, he informed the Court that his letters had been suppressed by  the sheriff:[18] that while his enemies had been allowed to fill the  newspapers with lying diatribes against him, and to prejudice the public  mind in view of his impending trial, his own letters to the Niagara  _Spectator_ had been rigidly withheld from the light of day, and this  by official interference. Chief Justice Powell put the cap-sheaf upon  the pinnacle of absurdity by informing him that if he chose he might  prosecute the sheriff. Prosecute the sheriff! when he had just been  sentenced by the Chief Justice himself to leave the Province within  twenty-four hours, and when he was liable to the last penalty of the law  in case of his return to prosecute!    The trial was ended, and--blissful thought!--for the ensuing twenty-four  hours he was free to come and go whithersoever he would. He was taken in  charge by his friends the Hamiltons, and spent the night in their house  at Queenston. Next day--Saturday, the 21st of August--he obeyed the  mandate of the law, and shook from his feet the parched dust of Upper  Canadian soil. His mental condition was far from satisfactory, but he  would brook no interference with his actions, even from his best  friends. The feeling uppermost in his bosom was a delicious sense of  being at large, with no one to shut the cell door upon him, or otherwise  to control his actions. He felt like one recalled to life. The unhappy  man was well aware that his brain was weak, but he also knew that he was  not what is ordinarily understood as insane. Like Baldassarre, he  carried within him that piteous stamp of sanity, the clear consciousness  of shattered faculties. His feebleness was as patent to himself as to  others. He knew that he was the mere wreck of what he had once been, and  he knew further that his mental and bodily ruin was due to the triumph  of tyranny and injustice. Still, he was, for the moment, happy. There  was sunshine in his heart, and gladness in his eye. Having crossed the  Niagara river, he knew that he was beyond the material grasp of those  whose baneful shadow was nevertheless destined to darken the rest of his  life. \"I thanked God,\" he writes, several years afterwards, \"as I set my  first foot on the American shore, that I trod on a land of freedom. The  flow of animal spirits carried me along for more than two miles in  triumphant disgust. It carried me beyond my strength, till, staggering  by the side of the road, I sunk down, almost lifeless, among the bushes,  and awoke from my dream to a state of sensibility and horror past all  power of description. If at my trial, and so long after it, I was  callous to feeling; if I was blind to objects around me, and regardless  of consequences, the scenes I had passed through were now too visible:  my senses were too keen; my feelings too acute. Before, all was frozen  and rigid; now, extreme relaxation resigned me to the torture of a  distracted mind, feeble, doubting, and irresolute. In fact, my nervous  system had undergone a most violent change; and, to this hour, the  effects are permanent: to this hour, with every effort and every  appliance, my natural tone of health and vigour cannot be regained.\"[19]    One of the bitterest reflections which forced itself upon him was that  he, a man of unimpeachable loyalty, had been banished--\"flung out like a  spoilt jelly,\"[20] under a statute which had been passed to guard  against the machinations of aliens and traitors. \"Banishment\" was to him  a word replete with repulsive and disgraceful associations. He liked it  no better than did the sweet rose of the Capulets.       \"Banished: that one word--_banished_.           *       *       *       *       *       There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,     In that word's death.\"           *       *       *       *       *    On the 27th of August, precisely a week after the trial above described,  a high and mighty English nobleman who was for the time domiciled in  Canada underwent a more terrible experience than ever fell to the lot of  Robert Gourlay. He was travelling at the time through a part of the  county of Carleton, and while wandering through the woods, attended by  several companions, he found himself exceedingly unwell. His spirits  were depressed, and he was dominated by what seemed an unaccountable  dread of water. His valet had noticed that for a day or two previously  he had shrunk from performing his customary ablutions, and had cleaned  his hands and face by the application of a damp towel. On approaching  within a few yards of a forest stream he was seized by violent spasms.  By a desperate resolution he forced himself to take his seat in a canoe  which had been provided, but the little craft had not proceeded many  yards ere he was seized by a fresh paroxysm, and in a frenzied tone  ordered the boatman to land him on the nearest bank. The order was  promptly obeyed, and he had no sooner escaped from the boat than he ran  frantically into the depths of the wood. He was pursued and overtaken by  his companions, who found him foaming at the mouth and raving mad. They  secured him until the paroxysm had spent itself, when they conveyed him  to a neighbouring shanty. The sufferer, at his own request, was soon  after removed to an adjoining barn, where he said he should be more  comfortable than in the shanty, as it was _further from the water_.  Throughout the rest of the day and ensuing night he was subject to  repeated returns of the paroxysms, during which he suffered untold  agonies. It was evident to himself and those about him that he was  afflicted by the most terrible of all maladies to which humanity is  subject--hydrophobia. He had been bitten by a tame fox a few weeks  before, and the deadly rabies had ever since been rankling in his  system. He realized that he must die, and the instincts of his race--he  was a remote by-blow of royalty--taught him to make an ending in a  manner becoming a gentleman. Towards evening he consented to be taken  back to the shanty, where a bed had been prepared for him. Except while  the paroxysms were upon him, he was perfectly calm and collected, and  gave his last sad directions to a friend who stood by his side. About  eight o'clock on the morning of the 28th the death-agony came upon him,  and his excruciating tortures were at an end.    Thus passed away Charles Gordon Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond, Earl of  March and Baron Settrington in the peerage of England; Duke of Lennox,  Earl of Darnley and Baron Methuen in the peerage of Scotland; Duc  d'Aubigny in France, Governor-General of Canada, lord of Halnaker,  Goodwood and West Hampnett. There was, as has been above hinted, a bar  sinister in his escutcheon, for he was descended from King Charles the  Second and the fair and frail Frenchwoman Louise Renee de Querouaille,  who was commonly known among Englishmen of her day as Madam Carwell.  This lady, who was probably the least bad of the unlicensed prostitutes  of Charles's seraglio at Whitehall, was for her many virtues created  Duchess of Portsmouth. Her descendants, like those of Nell Gwynn and the  rest of that frail sisterhood, are reckoned among the great ones of the  earth.

You are aware that I have long delayed an article on       Criminal Trials for the 'Westminster Review.' I have now set about       it seriously, and am resolved not to stir until it is finished,       which I hope may be on Saturday. I have likewise some things to       finish for Chambers before I go, and then I think I shall be able       to enjoy a few days of a stravaig.... I got a slight interruption       last night; just as the twilight came on, Alex. Smith came in. Now       I had been living like a hermit for some time, and though he has       been more than a fortnight returned I had not seen Smith for ten       days. The matter was irresistible. We set to and got very jolly       together. He complained of having low spirits, but they were soon       elevated, and before he went away he was leaping over the chairs,       and very anxious to leap out at the window. I received on Monday       the enclosed letter from Miss H. to you, and wrote by way of answer       that I should send it to Aberdeen intimating my intended visit. By       the way, a circumstance of some consequence occurs to me at this       moment. If you remain for three weeks in Aberdeen and then leave       it, you will do so just about a fortnight (I think) before the       Circuit. Might it not be as well to remain until that period, when       I might attend the Circuit and bring you back? I do not know at       this moment the day of the Circuit, but the newspapers will inform       you.         \"You may tell Robertson [the before mentioned 'Joseph'] that his       clothes may rot where they are until he chooses to write to me       himself about them. I suppose James will write you a household       statement some time or other soon. If you wish to amuse yourself       with reading the lives I wrote in the last number of the       Biography,[10] they are Archbishop Hamilton, Sir William Hamilton,       Dr Robert Henry, Edward Henryson, J. Bonaventura Hepburn, Roger       Hog, John Holybush, and Henry Home of Kames.... The gooseberries       appear to dwindle as they ripen. I am afraid few will remain for       you, but you will find a sufficient number where you are. I intend       to _walk_ to Dunkeld, and to take two days. Al. Smith may come a       bit with us.... All my little stock of news is exhausted. Pray       remember me to my grand-aunt, Mrs Brown, and my aunts; and I am, my       dear mother, your affectionate son,         \"JOHN HILL BURTON.\"         [Footnote 10: The Cyclopaedia of Universal Biography.]    This letter describes the beginning of the life of literary labour  which John Hill Burton's was to the end. He would not have liked to see  it described as labour. He even disliked the word work as applied to his  own pursuits, and he did indeed work as easily as most men play. He was  unconscious of his own powers of mental application: his mind worked  with as much ease as his lungs breathed. The great bulk of his earlier  writings must be quite irrecoverable now. He wrote school-books,  specially a set of historical abridgments for the use of schools, under  the name of Dr White; he also compiled much of the information in Oliver  and Boyd's 'Almanac,' and almost all the letterpress of Billings's  'Ecclesiastical and Baronial Antiquities.'    Dr Burton's whole resources at this time were derived from his pen. He  has described this mode of life as a somewhat anxious but by no means  unhappy one. The anxiety lay in that in which all sorts of business  share--the finding work, looking for employment. The employment once  found was agreeable to him. He rapidly acquired a power of mastering  almost any subject on which he had to write, though he always looked  forward with hope to the time, which eventually came, when he might live  securely on a fixed income, free to write from the fulness of his mind  and not from outward pressure.    The house in Howard Place was carefully managed by his mother. On a life  spent entirely in town proving unsuitable to her health, Dr Burton took  for her a little cottage at Brunstane, which served as country quarters  for the family for several years.    In 1844 Dr Burton married Isabella Lauder, daughter of Captain Lauder of  Flatfield, in Perthshire. He then occupied a house in Scotland Street,  and his mother and sister left him to reside in the little cottage  called Liberton Bank. There his beloved and revered mother died, in  1848. His sister still lives in the cottage with a little flock of young  relatives which her kindness has gathered around her.    Dr Burton's first appearance in independent authorship was in 1846, when  he published his 'Life and Correspondence of David Hume.' This work at  once gained for him a recognised position among men of letters.    In 1847 he published a volume containing the Lives of Simon Lord Lovat  and Duncan Forbes of Culloden. This is an eminently readable work, as  are all his minor productions. Literary persons did not consider its  merits quite equal to the promise given in its predecessor. During these  years much of the spare time left by the need of frequent publication  was filled by the task of editing Mr Jeremy Bentham's literary remains,  to which Dr Burton was joint editor along with Dr (afterwards Sir John),  Bowring. He published, as a precursor to the greater work, one styled  'Benthamiana; an Introduction to the Works of Jeremy Bentham.'    In 1849 he wrote for Messrs Chambers a little book entitled 'Political  and Social Economy: Its Practical Application.' May the writer here be  permitted to state that she considers this small and little-noticed work  the best of all her husband's productions? Though the subject is usually  considered particularly dry, there is an ease, rapidity, firmness, and  completeness in this little book, which carries the reader on in spite  of himself or his prejudices.    The book was first published in two small paper-covered volumes. The  writer by chance got possession of the first, which ended without even a  full stop; she, then a young girl of not particularly studious habits,  having read it, its arguments so filled her mind, that she could not  rest till, out of her not over-abundant pocket-money, she had purchased  the other volume. The author was then unknown to her. He was afterwards  gratified by hearing this testimony to the value of a work which he  himself did not esteem so highly as his others. It may not be counted  impertinent to repeat it here, for this reason, that the little book in  question was intended as a popular treatise, not addressed to the  learned, but to the unlearned. It fulfils to perfection the idea of what  such a treatise should be. There is in the style not the slightest  approach to condescension, or that writing down to the meaner capacity  which must always offend an adult student; while the first principles of  the science discussed are stated with such lucidity, that his capacity  must be mean indeed who cannot grasp them, and they are illustrated by  statistics which will remain always interesting, even to the best  informed. Probably the particular charm of the book arises from its  having been written _currente calamo_. The information had been all  previously stored in the author's mind before he ever thought of writing  it. When he began to write, it poured forth without effort or any  reference to authorities. The book was written in some marvellously  short time,--the writer fears now to say how short. It was counted in  days. It would have been quite contrary to Dr Burton's principles to  boast of rapidity of composition. His greater works are monuments of  industry. Dr Burton's information on economic subjects had probably been  acquired during his studies and correspondence about the abolition of  the Corn Laws. He was interim editor of the 'Scotsman' at an early  period of the Corn-Law agitation, and during his editorship committed  the journal to Anti-Corn-Law principles. He was at that time in  correspondence with Mr Cobden, whom he visited in Lancashire, and who  tried to induce him to remove to that part of the world for the purpose  of editing an Anti-Corn-Law newspaper.    Mrs Burton was fond of society, and her husband had not then become  positively averse to it. His acquaintance in Edinburgh gradually  increased. It included Lord Jeffrey and his family, Lord Murray, who  remained a fast friend during his life, and all the remaining members of  the old Edinburgh circle.    About the year 1848, the writer first saw Dr Burton, accompanied by his  wife, as guests at one of those late evening parties given by Mrs  Jeffrey during the last years of her husband's life--a very faint  reflection of the earlier hospitalities of Craigcrook and Moray Place.    In 1848 Dr Burton left Scotland Street for a house in Royal Crescent,  better suited for occasional reception than the other. But in 1849 the  heaviest blow of his life fell on him in the loss of his wife. His five  married years had been a period of perfect domestic happiness. He found  himself left with three infant daughters; their guide and his gone from  him. He has described his sufferings at this time to the writer as fully  realising to him the common phrase, \"a broken heart.\" As each day  passed, and each night returned, he rose and lay down with the feeling  that his heart was broken. He of course shunned all society, and never  again recovered any real zest for it. He sometimes thought of imitating  his grandfather under like circumstances with a difference--he thought  of flying, not to London, but to the backwoods of America, or some place  where he should never see a white face, and becoming a \"wild man,\" a  savage--a personage of whom he always believed himself to share many of  the"]]]
