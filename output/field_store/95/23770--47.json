She caught him by both jowls and tugged him forward.    \"Let him be!\" urged Vic.    \"He's got to come!\"    And come he did, step by halting step, while she hauled him, and now  the snarling hoarse intakes of breath filled the room. Once she moved  a little to one side and Vic caught the glint of two eyes, red-stained,  which were fixed undeviatingly upon her face. Mixed with Vic's alarm  at the great fighting beast was a peculiar uneasiness, for there was  something uncanny in the determination, the fearlessness of this infant.  When she stepped away the wolf-dog stood trembling visibly but his eyes  were still not upon the man he hated or feared to approach but upon the  child's face.    \"Can you pat him now?\" she asked, not for an instant turning to Gregg.    \"No, but it's close enough,\" he assured her. \"I don't want him any  closer.\"    \"He's got to come.\" She stamped. \"Bart, you come here!\"    He flinched forward, an inch. \"Bart!\" Her hands were clenched and her  little body quivered with resolution; the snake-like head came to the  very edge of the bed.    \"Now pat him!\" she commanded.    By very unpleasant degrees, Vic stretched his hand towards that growling  menace.    \"He'll take my arm off,\" he complained. Shame kept him from utterly  refusing the risk.    \"He won't bite you one bit,\" declared the child. \"But I'll hold his nose  if you're afraid.\" And instantly she clasped the pointed muzzle between  her hands.    Even when Vic's hand hovered above his head Bart had no eye for him,  could not divert his gaze from the face of the child. Once, twice  and again, delicately as one might handle bubbles, Gregg touched that  scarred forehead.    \"I made him come, didn't I?\" she cried in triumph, and turned a tense  little face towards Vic, but the instant her eyes moved the wolf-dog  leaped away half the width of the room, and stood shivering, more  devilish than ever. She stamped again.    \"Bad, bad, bad Bart,\" she said angrily. \"Shall I make him come again?\"    \"Leave him be,\" muttered Vic, closing his eyes. \"Leave him be where he  is. I don't want him.\"    \"Oh,\" she said, \"it's hard to make him do things, sometimes. But Daddy  Dan can make him do anything.\"    \"Humph!\" grunted Vic. He was remembering how, at the master's order,  Bart had crouched at his feet in the wood, an unchained murderer  hungrily waiting for an excuse to kill. There was something very odd  about the people of this house; and it would be a long time before he  rid himself of the impression of the cold, steady eyes which had flashed  up to him a moment before out of that baby face.    \"Joan!\" called a voice from beyond, and the soft fiber of it made Vic  certain that it belonged to the rider of the black stallion. The little  girl ran a step towards the door, and then stopped and shrank back  against the bed.    \"If you're afraid your Dad'll find you here,\" said Vic, \"just you run  along.\"    She was nervously twisting her hands in her dress.    \"Daddy Dan'll know,\" she whispered without turning. \"And--and--he won't  let me be afraid---even of him!\"    A small hand slipped up, fumbled a bit, found the thumb of Vic Gregg,  and closed softly over it. With this to steady her, she waited, facing  the door.        Chapter VIII. Discipline    A light step crossed the outer room, with something peculiar in its  lightness, as if the heel were not touching the floor, with the effect  of the padded fall of the feet of some great cat; there was both  softness and the sense of weight. First the wolf-dog pricked his ears  and turned towards the door, the pudgy fist closed convulsively over  Vic's thumb, and then his rescuer stood in the entrance.    \"Hello, partner,\" called Vic. \"I got company, you see. The door blew  open and I asked your little girl in.\"    \"I told you not to come here,\" said the other. Vic felt the child  tremble, but there was no burst of excuses.    \"She didn't want to come,\" he urged. \"But I kep' on askin' her.\"    The emotionless eye of \"Daddy Dan\" held upon Joan. \"I told you not to  come,\" he said. Joan swallowed in mute agony, and the wolf-dog slipped  to the side of the master and licked his hand as though in dumb  intercession. The blood ran coldly in the veins of Gregg, as if he saw a  fist raised to strike the little girl.    \"You go out.\"    She went swiftly, at that, sidled past her father with her eyes lifted,  fascinated, and so out the door where she paused an instant to flash  back a wistful appeal. Nothing but silence, and then her feet pattering  off into the outer room.    \"Maybe you better go keep her company, Bart,\" said the father, and at  this sign of relenting Vic felt his tensed muscles relaxing; the wolf  whined softly and glided through the door.    \"You feeling better?\"    \"Like a hoss off green feed. I been lyin' here drinkin' up the  sunshine.\"    The other stood beside the open window and there he canted his head, his  glance far off and intent.    \"D'you hear?\" he asked, turning sharply.    There was a fierce eagerness in his face.    \"Hear what?\"    \"It's spring,\" he murmured, without answering more directly than this,  and Vic felt that the other had changed again, grown understandable.  Nevertheless, the shock of that sudden alteration at the window kept  him watching his host with breathless interest. Whatever it was that the  strange fellow heard, a light had gleamed in his eyes for a moment. As  he sauntered back towards the bed just a trace of it lingered about him,  a hint of sternness.    \"Spring?\" answered Gregg. \"Yep, I smelled spring a few days back and I  started out to find some action. You can see for yourself that I found  it, partner.\" He stirred, uneasily, but it was necessary that the story  should be told lest it reach the ears of this man from another source.  It was one thing to shelter a fugitive from justice whose crime was  unknown, perhaps trifling, but it might be quite another story if this  gentle, singular man learned that his guest was a new-made murderer.  Better that he should learn the tale now and form his prejudices in  favor of Gregg. \"I'll tell you the whole story,\" he began.    But the other shrugged his shoulders.    \"You leave the story be,\" he said, and there was something in the quiet  firmness of his manner which made it impossible for Vic to continue.  \"You're here and you're hurt and you need a pile of rest. That's about  enough story for me.\"    Vic put himself swiftly in the place of the other. Suppose that he and  Betty Neal should have a cabin off in the mountains like this, how would  they receive a wounded fugitive from justice? As unquestioningly as  this? In a surge of gratitude he looked mistily towards his host.    \"Stranger,\" he said, \"you're white. Damned white. That's all. My name's  Vic Gregg and I come from--\"    \"Thanks,\" cut in the other. \"I'm glad to know your name but in case  anybody might be askin' me I wouldn't care to know where you come from.\"  He smiled. \"I'm Dan Barry.\"    It had to be a left-handed shake on the part of Vic, a thing of which  he often thought in the days that followed, but now he sent his memory  hunting.    \"Seems like I've heard your name before,\" he murmured. \"I dunno where.  Were you ever around Alder, Barry?\"    \"No.\" His manner suggested that the topic might as well be closed. He  reached over and dropped his hand lightly on the forehead of Vic. A  tingling current flowed from it into the brain of the wounded man. \"Your  blood's still a bit hot,\" he added. \"Lie quiet and don't even think.  You're safe here. They ain't a thing goin' to get at you. Not a thing.  You'll stay till you get ready to leave. S'long. I'll see that you get  something to eat.\"    He went out with that unusual, padding step which Vic had noticed before  and closed the door softly behind him. In spite of that barrier Gregg  could hear the noises from the next room quite clearly, as some one  brought in wood and dropped it on a stone hearth, rattling. He fell  into a pleasant doze, just stretching his body now and then to enjoy the  coolness of the sheets, the delicious sense of being cared for and the  returning strength in his muscles. Through that haze he heard voices,  presently, which called him back to wakefulness.    \"That ought to be good for him. Take it in, Kate.\"    \"I shall. Dan, what has Joan done?\"    \"She went in there. I told her to leave him alone.\"    \"But she says he asked her to come in--said he would take the blame.\"    \"I told her not to go.\"    \"Poor baby! She's outside, now, weeping her eyes out on Bart's shoulder  and he's trying to comfort her.\"    It was purer English than Vic was accustomed to hear even from his  schoolmistress, but more than the words, the voice surprised him, the  low, controlled voice of a woman of gentle blood. He turned his head and  looked out the window, baffled. Far above, shooting out of sight,  went the slope of a mountain, a cliff shining in the slant sun of the  afternoon here, a tumbled slide of rocks and debris there, and over the  shoulder of this mountain he saw white-headed monsters stepping back in  range beyond range. Why should a girl of refinement choose the isolation  of such a place as this for her home? It was not the only strange thing  about this household, however, and he would dismiss conjectures until he  was once more on his feet.    She was saying: \"Won't you speak to her now?\"    A little pause. Then: \"No, not until evenin'.\"    \"Please, Dan.\"    \"She's got to learn.\"    A little exclamation of unhappiness and then the door moved open; Vic  found himself looking up to the face with the golden hair which he  remembered out of his nightmare. She nodded to him cheerily.    \"I'm so happy that you're better,\" she said. \"Dan says that the fever is  nearly gone.\" She rested a large tray she carried on the foot of the bed  and Vic discovered, to his great content, that it was not hard to meet  her eyes. Usually girls embarrassed him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#8)"],[1,"and Italy; Bulgaria, Greece, and Balkan Turkey were debatable  regions wherein the diplomats of the rival nations secured temporary  victories by devious methods.    The Balkans have fierce hatreds and have been the site of sudden  historic wars. At the time of the declaration of the World War, the  Balkan nations were living under the provisions of the Treaty of  Bucharest, dated August 10, 1913. Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and  Montenegro were signers, and Turkey acquiesced in its provisions.      [Illustration: PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST, 1913. (Map showing  the Adriatic on the West, the Black Sea on the East, Roumania on the  North and Crete on the South. Cross hatching show land allocations  among Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, Bulgaria and Roumania.)]      The assassination at Sarajevo had sent a convulsive shudder throughout  the Balkans. The reason lay in the century-old antagonism between the  Slav and the Teuton. Serbia, Montenegro and Russia had never forgiven  Austria for seizing Bosnia and Herzegovina and making these Slavic  people subjects of the Austrian crown. Bulgaria, Roumania and Turkey  remained cold at the news of the assassination. German diplomacy was in  the ascendant at these courts and the prospect of war with Germany as  their great ally presented no terrors for them. The sympathies of the  people of Greece were with Serbia, but the Grecian Court, because the  Queen of Greece was the only sister of the German Kaiser, was whole  heartedly with Austria. Perhaps at the first the Roumanians were most  nearly neutral. They believed strongly that each of the small nations of  the Balkan region as well as all of the small nations that had been  absorbed but had not been digested by Austria, should cut itself from  the leading strings held by the large European powers. There was a  distinct undercurrent, for a federation resembling that of the United  States of America between these peoples. This was expressed most clearly  by M. Jonesco, leader of the Liberal party of Roumania and generally  recognized as the ablest statesman of middle Europe. He declared:    \"I always believed, and still believe, that the Balkan States cannot  secure their future otherwise than by a close understanding among  themselves, whether this understanding shall or shall not take the form  of a federation. No one of the Balkan States is strong enough to resist  the pressure from one or another of the European powers.    \"For this reason I am deeply grieved to see in the Balkan coalition of  1912 Roumania not invited. If Roumania had taken part in the first one,  we should not have had the second. I did all that was in my power and  succeeded in preventing the war between Roumania and the Balkan League  in the winter of 1912-13.    \"I risked my popularity, and I do not feel sorry for it. I employed all  my efforts to prevent the second Balkan war, which, as is well known,  was profitable to us. I repeatedly told the Bulgarians that they ought  not to enter it because in that case we would enter it too. But I was  not successful in my efforts.    \"During the second Balkan war I did all in my power to end it as quickly  as possible. At the conference at Bucharest I made efforts, as Mr.  Pashich and Mr. Venizelos know very well, to secure for beaten Bulgaria  the best terms. My object was to obtain a new coalition of all the  Balkan States, including Roumania. Had I succeeded in this the situation  would be much better. No reasonable man will deny that the Balkan States  are neutralizing each other at the present time, which in itself makes  the whole situation all the more miserable.    \"In October, 1913, when I succeeded in facilitating the conclusion of  peace between Greece and Turkey, I was pursuing the same object of the  Balkan coalition. On my return from Athens I endeavored, though without  success, to put the Greco-Turkish relations on a basis of friendship,  being convinced that the well-understood interest of both countries lies  not only in friendly relations, but even in an alliance between them.    \"The dissensions that exist between the Balkan States can be settled in  a friendly way without war. The best moment for this would be after the  general war, when the map of Europe will be remade. The Balkan country  which would start war against another Balkan country would commit, not  only a crime against her own future, but an act of folly as well.    \"The destiny and future of the Balkan States, and of all the small  European peoples as well, will not be regulated by fratricidal wars,  but, with this great European struggle, the real object of which is to  settle the question whether Europe shall enter an era of justice, and  therefore happiness for the small peoples, or whether we will face a  period of oppression more or less gilt-edged. And as I always believed  that wisdom and truth will triumph in the end, I want to believe, too,  that, in spite of the pessimistic news reaching me from the different  sides of the Balkan countries, there will be no war among them in order  to justify those who do not believe in the vitality of the small  peoples.\"    The conference at Rome, April 10, 1918, to settle outstanding questions  between the Italians and the Slavs of the Adriatic, drew attention to  those Slavonic peoples in Europe who were under non-Slavonic rule. At  the beginning of the war there were three great Slavonic groups in  Europe: First, the Russians with the Little Russians, speaking languages  not more different than the dialect of Yorkshire is from the dialect of  Devonshire; second, a central group, including the Poles, the Czechs or  Bohemians, the Moravians, and Slovaks, this group thus being separated  under the four crowns of Russia, Germany, Austria and Hungary; the  third, the southern group, included the Sclavonians, the Croatians, the  Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, the Slavs, generally called  Slovenes, in the western part of Austria, down to Goritzia, and also the  two independent kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia.    Like the central group, this southern group of Slavs was divided under  four crowns, Hungary, Austria, Montenegro, and Serbia; but, in spite of  the fact that half belong to the Western and half to the Eastern Church,  they are all essentially the same people, though with considerable  infusion of non-Slavonic blood, there being a good deal of Turkish blood  in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The languages, however, are practically  identical, formed largely of pure Slavonic materials, and, curiously,  much more closely connected with the eastern Slav group--Russia and  Little Russia--than with the central group, Polish and Bohemian. A  Russian of Moscow will find it much easier to understand a Slovene from  Goritzia than a Pole from Warsaw. The Ruthenians in southern Galicia and  Bukowina, are identical in race and speech with the Little Russians of  Ukrainia.    Of the central group, the Poles have generally inclined to Austria,  which has always supported the Polish landlords of Galicia against the  Ruthenian peasantry; while the Czechs have been not so much  anti-Austrian as anti-German. Indeed, the Hapsburg rulers have again and  again played these Slavs off against their German subjects. It was the  Southern Slav question as affecting Serbia and Austria, that gave the  pretext for the present war. The central Slav question affecting the  destiny of the Poles--was a bone of contention between Austria and  Germany. It is the custom to call the Southern Slavs \"Jugoslavs\" from  the Slav word Yugo, \"south,\" but as this is a concession to German  transliteration, many prefer to write the word \"Yugoslav,\" which  represents its pronunciation. The South Slav question was created by the  incursions of three Asiatic peoples--Huns, Magyars, Turks--who broke up  the originally continuous Slav territory that ran from the White Sea to  the confines of Greece and the Adriatic.

This    illustrates the early trench warfare before the development of the    elaborate concrete-protected structures the Germans later devised.    They can be seen wearing the famous spiked helmets which were later    replaced by steel ones.      This was the complex of nationalities, the ferment of races existing in  1914. Out of the hatreds engendered by the domination over the  liberty-loving Slavic peoples by an arrogant Teutonic minority grew the  assassinations at Sarajevo. These crimes were the expression of hatred  not for the heir apparent of Austria but for the Hapsburg and their  Germanic associates.    By a twist of the wheel of fate, the same Slavic peoples whose  determination to rid themselves of the Teutonic yoke, started the war,  also bore rather more than their share in the swift-moving events that  decided and closed the war.    Russia, the dying giant among the great nations, championed the Slavic  peoples at the beginning of the war. It entered the conflict in aid of  little Serbia, but at the end Russia bowed to Germany in the infamous"]]]
