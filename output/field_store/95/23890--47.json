All I wish to impress on you by way of introduction is that the  results of the Science of Language, which, without the aid of  Sanskrit, would never have been obtained, form an essential element of  what we call a liberal, that is an historical education--an education  which will enable a man to do what the French call _s'orienter_, that  is, \"to find his East,\" \"his true East,\" and thus to determine his  real place in the world; to know, in fact, the port whence man  started, the course he has followed, and the port toward which he has  to steer.    We all come from the East--all that we value most has come to us from  the East, and in going to the East, not only those who have received a  special Oriental training, but everybody who has enjoyed the  advantages of a liberal, that is, of a truly historical education,  ought to feel that he is going to his \"old home,\" full of memories, if  only he can read them. Instead of feeling your hearts sink within you,  when next year you approach the shores of India, I wish that every one  of you could feel what Sir William Jones felt, when, just one hundred  years ago, he came to the end of his long voyage from England, and saw  the shores of India rising on the horizon. At that time, young men  going to the wonderland of India were not ashamed of dreaming dreams  and seeing visions; and this was the dream dreamed and the vision seen  by Sir William Jones, then simple Mr. Jones:        \"When I was at sea last August (that is in August, 1783), on      my last voyage to this country (India) I had long and      ardently desired to visit, I found one evening, on inspecting      the observations of the day, that _India_ lay before us,      _Persia_ on our left, while a breeze from _Arabia_ blew      nearly on our stern. A situation so pleasing in itself and to      me so new, could not fail to awaken a train of reflections in      a mind which had early been accustomed to contemplate with      delight the eventful histories and agreeable fictions of this      Eastern world. It gave me inexpressible pleasure to find      myself in the midst of so noble an amphitheatre, almost      encircled by the vast regions of Asia, which has ever been      esteemed the nurse of sciences, the inventress of delightful      and useful arts, the scene of glorious actions, fertile in      the productions of human genius, and infinitely diversified      in the forms of religion and government, in the laws,      manners, customs, and languages, as well as in the features      and complexions of men. I could not help remarking how      important and extensive a field was yet unexplored, and how      many solid advantages unimproved.\"    India wants more such dreamers as that young Mr. Jones, standing alone  on the deck of his vessel and watching the sun diving into the  sea--with the memories of England behind and the hopes of India before  him, feeling the presence of Persia and its ancient monarchs, and  breathing the breezes of Arabia and its glowing poetry. Such dreamers  know how to make their dreams come true, and how to change their  visions into realities.    And as it was a hundred years ago, so it is now; or at least, so it  may be now. There are many bright dreams to be dreamed about India,  and many bright deeds to be done in India, if only you will do them.  Though many great and glorious conquests have been made in the history  and literature of the East, since the days when Sir William Jones[16]  landed at Calcutta, depend upon it, no young Alexander here need  despair because there are no kingdoms left for him to conquer on the  ancient shores of the Indus and the Ganges.

TRUTHFUL CHARACTER OF THE HINDUS.      In my first Lecture I endeavored to remove the prejudice that  everything in India is strange, and so different from the intellectual  life which we are accustomed to in England, that the twenty or  twenty-five years which a civil servant has to spend in the East seem  often to him a kind of exile that he must bear as well as he can, but  that severs him completely from all those higher pursuits by which  life is made enjoyable at home. This need not be so and ought not to  be so, if only it is clearly seen how almost every one of the higher  interests that make life worth living here in England, may find as  ample scope in India as in England.    To-day I shall have to grapple with another prejudice which is even  more mischievous, because it forms a kind of icy barrier between the  Hindus and their rulers, and makes anything like a feeling of true  fellowship between the two utterly impossible.    That prejudice consists in looking upon our stay in India as a kind of  _moral_ exile, and in regarding the Hindus as an inferior race,  totally different from ourselves in their moral character, and, more  particularly in what forms the very foundation of the English  character, respect for truth.    I believe there is nothing more disheartening to any high-minded young  man than the idea that he will have to spend his life among human  beings whom he can never respect or love--natives, as they are called,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#8)"],[1,"still less than that of oxygen.    Pure hydrogen produces no injurious results when inhaled. Of course one  could not live in an atmosphere of the gas, since oxygen is essential to  respiration.    ~Chemical properties.~ At ordinary temperatures hydrogen is not an active  element. A mixture of hydrogen and chlorine, however, will combine with  explosive violence at ordinary temperature if exposed to the sunlight.  The union can be brought about also by heating. The product formed in  either case is hydrochloric acid. Under suitable conditions hydrogen  combines with nitrogen to form ammonia, and with sulphur to form the  foul-smelling gas, hydrogen sulphide. The affinity of hydrogen for  oxygen is so great that a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen or hydrogen  and air explodes with great violence when heated to the kindling  temperature (about 612 deg.). Nevertheless under proper conditions hydrogen  may be made to burn quietly in either oxygen or air. The resulting  hydrogen flame is almost colorless and is very hot. The combustion of  the hydrogen is, of course, due to its union with oxygen. The product of  the combustion is therefore a compound of hydrogen and oxygen. That this  compound is water may be shown easily by experiment.    [Illustration Fig. 12]         ~Directions for burning hydrogen in air.~ The combustion of       hydrogen in air may be carried out safely as follows: The       hydrogen is generated in the bottle A (Fig. 12), is dried by       conducting it through the tube X, filled with some substance       (generally calcium chloride) which has a great attraction for       moisture, and escapes through the tube T, the end of which is       drawn out to a jet. The hydrogen first liberated mixes with the       air contained in the generator. If a flame is brought near the       jet before this mixture has all escaped, a violent and very       dangerous explosion results, since the entire apparatus is       filled with the explosive mixture. On the other hand, if the       flame is not applied until all the air has been expelled, the       hydrogen is ignited and burns quietly, since only the small       amount of it which escapes from the jet can come in contact       with the oxygen of the air at any one time. By holding a cold,       dry bell jar or bottle over the flame, in the manner shown in       the figure, the steam formed by the combustion of the hydrogen       is condensed, the water collecting in drops on the sides of the       jar.    ~Precautions.~ In order to avoid danger it is absolutely necessary to  prove that the hydrogen is free from air before igniting it. This can be  done by testing small amounts of the escaping gas. A convenient and safe  method of doing this is to fill a test tube with the gas by inverting it  over the jet. The hydrogen, on account of its lightness, collects in the  tube, displacing the air. After holding it over the jet for a few  moments in order that it may be filled with the gas, the tube is gently  brought, mouth downward, to the flame of a burner placed not nearer than  an arm's length from the jet. If the hydrogen is mixed with air a slight  explosion occurs, but if pure it burns quietly in the tube. The  operation is repeated until the gas burns quietly, when the tube is  quickly brought back over the jet for an instant, whereby the escaping  hydrogen is ignited by the flame in the tube.    [Illustration. Fig. 13]    ~A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is explosive.~ That a mixture of  hydrogen and air is explosive may be shown safely as follows: A cork  through which passes a short glass tube about 1 cm. in diameter is  fitted air-tight into the tubule of a bell jar of 2 l. or 3 l. capacity.  (A thick glass bottle with bottom removed may be used.) The tube is  closed with a small rubber stopper and the bell jar filled with  hydrogen, the gas being collected over water. When entirely filled with  the gas the jar is removed from the water and supported by blocks of  wood in order to leave the bottom of the jar open, as shown in Fig. 13.  The stopper is now removed from the tube in the cork, and the hydrogen,  which on account of its lightness escapes from the tube, is at once  lighted. As the hydrogen escapes, the air flows in at the bottom of the  jar and mixes with the remaining portion of the hydrogen, so that a  mixture of the two soon forms, and a loud explosion results. The  explosion is not dangerous, since the bottom of the jar is open, thus  leaving room for the expansion of the hot gas.    Since air is only one fifth oxygen, the remainder being inert gases, it  may readily be inferred that a mixture of hydrogen with pure oxygen  would be far more explosive than a mixture of hydrogen with air. Such  mixtures should not be made except in small quantities and by  experienced workers.    ~Hydrogen does not support combustion.~ While hydrogen is readily  combustible, it is not a supporter of combustion. In other words,  substances will not burn in it. This may be shown by bringing a lighted  candle supported by a stiff wire into a bottle or cylinder of the pure  gas, as shown in Fig. 14. The hydrogen is ignited by the flame of the  candle and burns at the mouth of the bottle, where it comes in contact  with the oxygen in the air. When the candle is thrust up into the gas,  its flame is extinguished on account of the absence of oxygen. If slowly  withdrawn, the candle is relighted as it passes through the layer of  burning hydrogen.    [Illustration: Fig. 14]    [Illustration: Fig. 15]    ~Reduction.~ On account of its great affinity for oxygen, hydrogen has the  power of abstracting it from many of its compounds. Thus, if a stream of  hydrogen, dried by passing through the tube B (Fig. 15), filled with  calcium chloride, is conducted through the tube C containing some  copper oxide, heated to a moderate temperature, the hydrogen abstracts  the oxygen from the copper oxide. The change may be represented as  follows:         hydrogen + {copper}                 {hydrogen}                  {oxygen}(copper oxide) = {oxygen  }(water) + copper    The water formed collects in the cold portions of the tube C near its  end. In this experiment the copper oxide is said to undergo reduction.  _Reduction may therefore be defined as the process of withdrawing oxygen  from a compound._    ~Relation of reduction to oxidation.~ At the same time that the copper  oxide is reduced it is clear that the hydrogen is oxidized, for it  combines with the oxygen given up by the copper oxide. The two processes  are therefore very closely related, and it usually happens that when one  substance is oxidized some other substance is reduced. That substance  which gives up its oxygen is called an _oxidizing agent_, while the  substance which unites with the oxygen is called a _reducing agent_.    ~The oxyhydrogen blowpipe.~ This is a form of apparatus used for burning  hydrogen in pure oxygen. As has been previously stated, the flame  produced by the combustion of hydrogen in the air is very hot. It is  evident that if pure oxygen is substituted for air, the temperature  reached will be much higher, since there are no inert gases to absorb  the heat. The oxyhydrogen blowpipe, used to effect this combination,  consists of a small tube placed within a larger one, as shown in Fig.  16.    [Illustration: Fig. 16]    The hydrogen, stored under pressure, generally in steel cylinders, is  first passed through the outer tube and ignited at the open end of the  tube. The oxygen from a similar cylinder is then conducted through the  inner tube, and mixes with the hydrogen at the end of the tube. In order  to produce the maximum heat, the hydrogen and oxygen must be admitted to  the blowpipe in the exact proportion in which they combine, viz., 2  volumes of hydrogen to 1 of oxygen, or by weight, 1 part of hydrogen to  7.94 parts of oxygen. The intensity of the heat may be shown by bringing  into the flame pieces of metal such as iron wire or zinc. These burn  with great brilliancy. Even platinum, having a melting point of 1779 deg.,  may be melted by the heat of the flame.    While the oxyhydrogen flame is intensely hot, it is almost non-luminous.  If directed against some infusible substance like ordinary lime (calcium  oxide), the heat is so intense that the lime becomes incandescent and  glows with a brilliant light. This is sometimes used as a source of  light, under the name of _Drummond_ or _lime light_.    [Illustration: Fig. 17]    ~The blast lamp.~ A similar form of apparatus is commonly used in the  laboratory as a source of heat under the name _blast lamp_ (Fig. 17).  This differs from the oxyhydrogen blowpipe only in the size of the  tubes. In place of the hydrogen and oxygen the more accessible coal gas  and air are respectively used. The former is composed largely of a  mixture of free hydrogen and gaseous compounds of carbon and hydrogen.  While the temperature of the flame is not so high as that of the  oxyhydrogen blowpipe, it nevertheless suffices for most chemical  operations carried out in the laboratory.    ~Uses of hydrogen.~ On account of its cost, hydrogen is but little used  for commercial purposes. It is sometimes used as a material for the  inflation of balloons, but usually the much cheaper coal gas is  substituted for it. Even hot air is often used when the duration of  ascension is very short. It has been used also as a source of heat and  light in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe. Where the electric current is  available, however, this form of apparatus has been displaced almost  entirely by the electric light and electric furnace, which are much more  economical and more powerful sources of light and heat.      EXERCISES    1. Will a definite weight of iron decompose an unlimited weight of  steam?    2. Why is oxygen passed through the inner tube of the oxyhydrogen  blowpipe rather than the outer?    3. In Fig. 14, will the flame remain at the mouth of the tube? "]]]
