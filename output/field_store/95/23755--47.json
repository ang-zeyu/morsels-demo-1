Here they were put ashore, with their  hands tied, and so left. They were released by the Berbers, and after  their reappearance in Spain, a \"street at the foot of the hot bath in  Lisbon,\" concludes Edrisi, \"took the name of Street of the Wanderers.\"    On the other extremity of the Moslem world, on the south-east coast of  Africa, there was more real progress. By Edrisi's day that important  addition of Arabic travellers and merchants to the geographical  knowledge of the world, by the remarkable trade-ventures of the  Emosaids, had been already made.    It had taken long in the making.    [Illustration: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO EDRISI. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    About A.D. 742, ten years after the battle of Tours, the Emosaid family,  descended from Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Mahomet, tried to make  Said, their clan-chieftain, Ali's great-grandson, Caliph at Damascus.  The attempt was foiled, and the whole tribe fled, sailed down the Red  Sea and African coast, and established themselves as traders in the Sea  of India. First of all, Socotra seems to have been their mart and  capital, but before the end of the tenth century they had founded  merchant colonies at Melinda, Mombasa, and Mozambique, which, in their  turn, led to settlements on the opposite coasts of Asia. Thus the trade  of the Indian Ocean was secured for Islam, the first Moslem settlements  arose in Malabar, and when the Portuguese broke into this _mare  clausum_, in 1497-8, they found a belt of \"Moorish\" coast towns, from  Magadoxo to Quiloa, controlling both the Indian and the inland African  trades, as Ibn Batuta had found in 1330.    By Edrisi's day, moreover, the steady persistence and self-evident  results of Arabic overland exploration had become recognised by a sort  of \"Traveller's Doctorate.\" It was not enough for the highest knowledge  to study the Koran, and the Sunna, and the Greek philosophers at home;  for a perfect education, a man must have travelled at least through the  length and breadth of Islam. All the successors of Edrisi, in the  twelfth and thirteenth centuries, shew this mingling of science and  religion, of practical and speculative energy.    Tradition still governed Moslem thought, but there had come into being a  sort of half-acknowledged appendix to tradition, made up of real  observations on men and things. And in these observations, geographical  interest was the main factor.    The Life of Al Heravy of Herat (1173-1215), the \"Doctor Ubiquitus\" of  Islam in the age of the Crusades, gives us a picture of another  Massoudy. The friend of the Emperor Manuel Comnenus, the \"first man  among Christians,\" Heravy seems able in his own person to break down the  partition wall of religious feud by the common interest of science. In  1192 he was offered the patronage of the Crusading princes, and Richard  Coeur de Lion begged for the favour of an interview, and begged in  vain. Heravy, who had been on one of his exploring journeys, angrily  refused to see the King whose men had broken his quiet and wasted his  time. Before his death, he had run over the world (men said) from China  to the Pyrenees and from Abyssinia to the Danube, \"scribbling his name  on every wall,\" and his survey of the Eastern Empire was the single  matter in which Turks and \"Romans\" made common cause,--for Greeks and  Latins at Byzantium alike read Heravy, like a Christian doctor. Another  example of the same catholic spirit is \"Yacout the Roman,\"[16] whose  _Dictionary_, finished in the earlier half of the thirteenth century,  was a summary of geographical advance since Edrisi, like the similar  work of Ibn Said, of the same period.    [Footnote 16: Yacout \"the ruby,\" originally a Greek slave, who made a  brave but fruitless attempt to change his name into Yacoub or Jacob,  became one of the greatest of Arab encyclopaedists, was checked by the  hordes of Genghiz-Khan in his exploration of Central Asia, and died  1229.]    But as a matter of fact, the balance both of knowledge and power was now  shifting from Islam to Christendom. The most daring and successful  travellers after the rise of the Mongols were the Venetian Marco Polo  and the Friar Preachers who revived Chinese Christianity (1270-1350);  Madeira and the Canaries (off Moslem Africa) were finally rediscovered  not by Arabic enterprise, but by the Italian Malocello in 1270, by the  English Macham in the reign of our Edward III., and by Portuguese ships  under Genoese captains in 1341; in 1291 the Vivaldi ventured beyond Cape  Bojador, where no Moor had ever been, except by force of storm, as in  the doubtful story of Ibn Fatimah, who \"first saw the White Headland,\"  Cape Blanco, between Cape Bojador and Cape Verde.    In the fourteenth century the map of Edrisi was superseded by the new  Italian plans and coast-charts, or Portolani. As the Moslem world fell  into political disorder, its science declined. \"Judicial astrology\"  seemed gaining a stronger and stronger hold over Islam, and the  irruption of the Turks gradually resulted in the ruin of all the higher  Moslem culture. Superstition and barbarism shared the honour and the  spoils of this victory.    But two great names close the five hundred years of Arab learning.    1. Ibn Batuta (_c._ 1330), who made himself as much at home in China as  in his native Morocco, is the last of Mohammedan travellers of real  importance. Though we have only abridgments of his work left to us,  Colonel Yule is well within his rights in his deliberate judgment, \"that  it must rank at least as one of the four chief guide books of the  Middle Ages,\" along with the _Book of Ser Marco Polo_ and the journals  of the two Friar-travellers, Friar Odoric and Friar William de  Rubruquis.    2. With _Abulfeda_ the Eastern school of Moslem geography comes to an  end, as the Western does with Ibn Batuta. In the early years of the  fourteenth century he rewrote the \"story and description of the Land of  Islam,\" with a completeness quite encyclopaedic. But his work has all the  failings of a compilation, however careful, in that, or any, age. It is  based upon information, not upon inspection; it is in no sense original.  As it began in imitation, so it ended. If it rejects Ptolemy, it is only  to follow Strabo or someone else; on all the mathematical and  astronomical data its doctrine is according to the Alexandrians of  twelve hundred years before, and this last _precis_ of the science of a  great race and a great religion can only be understood in the light of  its model--in Greek geography.          CHAPTER I.    EARLY CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS.    CIRCA 333-867.      The special interest of the life and work of Henry the Navigator  (1394-1460) lies in the relation it bears to the general expansion  of Europe and Christendom--an expansion that had been slowly gathering  strength since the eleventh century. But even before the tide had  turned in the age of Hildebrand and the First Crusade, even from the  time that Constantine founded the Christian Empire of Rome, the Christian  Capital on the Bosphorus, and the State Church of the Western  World,--pilgrimage, trade, conquest, and colonisation had been  successively calling out the energies of the moving races, \"the motor  muscles\" of Europe. It is through the \"generous Henry, Prince of  Portugal,\" that this activity is brought to its third and triumphant  stage--to the time of Columbus and Da Gama and Magellan,--but it is only  by tracing the earlier progress of that outward movement, which has made  Europe the ruling civilisation of the world, that we can fairly grasp  the import of that transition in which Henry is the hero.    More than any other single man he is the author of the discovering  movement of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries,--and by  this movement India has been conquered, America repeopled, the world  made clear, and the civilisation which the Roman Empire left behind has  conquered or utterly overshadowed every one of its old rivals and  superiors--Islam, India, China, Tartary.    But before the fifteenth century, before the birth of Prince Henry,  Christendom, Greek and Latin, was at best only one of the greater  civilising and conquering forces struggling for mastery; before the age  of the Crusades, before the eleventh century, it was plainly weaker than  the Moslem powers; it seemed unable to fight against Slav or  Scandinavian Heathendom; it was only saved by distance from becoming a  province of China; India, the world's great prize, was cut off from it  by the Arabs. Even before the rise of Islam, under Constantine or  Theodosius or Justinian, the Church-State of the Byzantine Caesars,  though then ruling in almost every province of Trajan's empire, was in a  splendid but sure decline from the exhaustion of the southern races. Our  story then begins naturally with the worst time and climbs up for a  thousand years, from the Heathen and Mohammedan conquests of the fifth  and seventh centuries, to the reversal of that judgment, of those  conquests, in the fifteenth. The expansion of Europe is going on all  this time, but at our beginning, in the years before and after Pope  Gregory the Great, even the legacy of Greece and Rome, in wide knowledge  of the world and practical exploring energy, seemed to have passed from  sight.    And in the decline of the old Empire, while Constantine and Justinian  are said to receive and exchange embassies with the Court of China,  there is no real extension of geographical knowledge or outlook.  Christian enterprise in this field is mainly one of pilgrimage, and the  pilgrims only cease to be important when the Northmen, first Heathen,  then Christian, begin to lead, in a very different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#8)"],[1," dogs, squirrels and  rabbits, canary birds and parrots--but never any that I loved more than  I did old Jack; and to this day I am ashamed of the deception I  practiced upon him in the matter of the oats, when trying to catch him.  I don't wonder he resented the trick, and played one on me in return.    But I am transgressing the rule I laid down for myself in the outset of  these stories--not to prate much about my own pets. According to this  rule, I ought to have touched much more lightly upon the life and times  of old Jack.    A correspondent of the Providence (R. I.) Journal, gives an account of a  horse in his neighborhood that was remarkably fond of music. \"A  physician,\" he says, \"called daily to visit a patient opposite to my  place of residence. We had a piano in the room on the street, on which a  young lady daily practiced for several hours in the morning. The weather  was warm, and the windows were open, and the moment the horse caught the  sound of the piano, he would deliberately wheel about, cross the street,  place himself as near the window as possible, and there, with ears and  eyes dilating, would he quietly stand and listen till his owner came for  him. This was his daily practice. Sometimes the young lady would stop  playing when the doctor drove up. The horse would then remain quietly in  his place; but the first stroke of a key would arrest his attention, and  half a dozen notes would invariably call him across the street. I  witnessed the effect several times.\"    There was a show-bill printed during the reign of Queen Anne, a copy of  which is still to be seen in one of the public libraries in England, to  the following effect: \"To be seen, at the Ship, upon Great Tower Hill,  the finest taught horse in the world. He fetches and carries like a  spaniel dog. If you hide a glove, a handkerchief, a door key, a pewter  spoon, or so small a thing as a silver twopence, he will seek about the  room till he has found it, and then he will bring it to his master.  He will also tell the number of spots on a card, and leap through a  hoop; with a variety of other curious performances.\"    [Illustration: ALEXANDER TAMING BUCEPHALUS.]    The story of Alexander the Great, and his favorite horse Bucephalus,  doubtless most of my readers have heard before. Bucephalus was a  war-horse of a very high spirit, which had been sent to Philip,  Alexander's father, when the latter was a boy. This horse was taken out  into one of the parks connected with the palace, and the king and many  of his courtiers went to see him. The horse pranced about so furiously,  that every body was afraid of him. He seemed perfectly unmanageable. No  one was willing to risk his life by mounting such an unruly animal.  Philip, instead of being thankful for the present, was inclined to be in  ill humor about it. In the mean time, the boy Alexander stood quietly  by, watching all the motions of the horse, and seeming to be studying  his character. Philip had decided that the horse was useless, and had  given orders to have him sent back to Thessaly, where he came from.  Alexander did not much like the idea of losing so fine an animal, and  begged his father to allow him to mount the horse. Philip at first  refused, thinking the risk was too great. But he finally consented,  after his son had urged him a great while. So Alexander went up to the  horse, and took hold of his bridle. He patted him upon the neck, and  soothed him with his voice, showing him, at the same time, by his easy  and unconcerned manner, that he was not in the least afraid of him.  Bucephalus was calmed and subdued by the presence of Alexander. He  allowed himself to be caressed. Alexander turned his head in such a  direction as to prevent his seeing his own shadow, which had before  appeared to frighten him. Then he threw off his cloak, and sprang upon  the back of the horse, and let him go as fast as he pleased. The animal  flew across the plain, at the top of his speed, while the king and his  courtiers looked on, at first with extreme fear, but afterward with the  greatest admiration and pleasure. When Bucephalus had got tired of  running, he was easily reined in, and Alexander returned to the king,  who praised him very highly, and told him that he deserved a larger  kingdom than Macedon. Alexander had a larger kingdom, some years  after--a great deal larger one--though that is a part of another story.    Bucephalus became the favorite horse of Alexander, and was very  tractable and docile, though full of life and spirit. He would kneel  upon his fore legs, at the command of his master, in order that he might  mount more easily. A great many anecdotes are related of the feats of  Bucephalus, as a war-horse. He was never willing to have any one ride  him but Alexander. When the horse died, Alexander mourned for him a  great deal. He had him buried with great solemnity, and built a small  city upon the spot of his interment, which he named, in honor of his  favorite, Bucephalia.    An odd sort of an old mare, called by her master Nancy, used to go by my  father's house, when I was a child. She was the bearer of Peter  Packer--Uncle Peter, as he was sometimes called by the good people in  our neighborhood--and he was the bearer of the weekly newspaper, and  was, withal, quite as odd as his mare. As long as I can remember, Uncle  Peter went his weekly rounds, and for aught I know, he is going to this  day. No storm, or tempest, or snow-bank, could detain him, that is, not  longer than a day or two, in his mission. He was a very punctual man--in  other words, he always paced leisurely along, some time or another.  Speaking of pacing, reminds me that the mare aforesaid belonged to that  particular class and order called _pacers_, from their peculiar gait. I  should think, too, that the mare was not altogether unlike the  celebrated animal on which Don Quixote rode in pursuit of wind-mills,  and things of that sort. But she had one peculiarity which is not set  down in the description of Rozinante, to wit: the faculty of diagonal or  oblique locomotion. This mare of Uncle Peter's went forward something  after the fashion of a crab, and a little like a ship with the wind  abeam, as the sailors would say. It was a standing topic of dispute  among us school-boys, whether the animal went head foremost or not. But  that did not matter much, practically, it is true, so that she always  made her circuit; and that she did, as I have said before. Sometimes she  was a day or two later than usual. But that seldom occurred except in  the summer season; and when it did happen, it was on this wise: she had  a most passionate love for the study of practical botany; and not being  allowed, when at home, to pursue her favorite science as often as she  wished, owing partly to a want of specimens, and partly to her master's  desire to educate her in the more solid branches--he was a great  advocate for the solid branches--she frequently took the liberty to  divest herself of her bridle, when standing at the door of her master's  customers, and to pace away in search of the dear flowers. Oh, she was a  devoted student of botany! so much so, that her desire to obtain  botanical specimens did sometimes interfere a good deal with her  other literary and scientific engagements. She used to do very nearly as  she chose. Uncle Peter seldom crossed her in her inclinations. If she  was pacing along the highway, and felt a little thirsty, she never  hesitated to stop, whether her master invited her to do so or not, at a  brook or a watering-trough. Uncle Peter used to say, that he never tried  to prevent these liberties but once, and he had occasion to repent  bitterly of that. A thunder-storm was coming on, and he was in a hurry  to get to the next house. But the mare was determined, before she went  any further, to stop at a stream of water and drink. He set out to have  his way--Nancy set out to have hers. The result was, that Peter was  obliged to yield. But that was not the worst of it. The old mare was so  much vexed because her master disputed her will, that while she was  standing in the brook, she threw up her hind feet and let him fall over  her head into the water. That gentle correction cured Uncle Peter. She  had her own way after the ducking.    [Illustration: UNCLE PETER AND HIS OLD MARE.]    Horses have been known to cherish a strong attachment for each other. In  one of the British wars called the peninsular war, two horses, who had  long been associated together, assisting in dragging the same piece of  artillery, became so much attached to each other as to be inseparable  companions. At length one of them was killed in battle. After the  engagement was over, the other horse was attended to, as usual, and his  food was brought to him. But he refused to eat, and was constantly  turning his head to look for his former companion, sometimes neighing,  as if to call her. All the attention which was bestowed upon him was of  no avail. Though surrounded by other horses, he took no notice of them,  but was continually mourning for his lost friend. Shortly after he died,  having refused to taste any food from the day his companion was killed.    An old Shetland pony was so much attached to a little boy, his master,  that he would place his fore feet in the hands of the boy, like a dog,  thrust his head under his arm, to court his caresses, and join with him  and a little dog in their noisy rompings. The same animal daily carried  his master to school. He would even walk alone from the stable to the  school-house, to bring the boy home, and sometimes he would wait hours  for him, having come much too early.    But I have occupied the reader's attention long enough with stories of  the horse, interesting and noble as this animal is. I must, however,  before I pass to another subject, recite a touching ballad, from one of  our sweetest bards.    [Illustration: THE OLD HORSE'S"]]]
