[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#8)"],[1,"also must stand very high;  but since there is a limit to this, we are often compelled to make the  larynx take a lower position.    [Illustration: Correct. Incorrect.]    The correct position of the tongue, preparatory to singing, is gained  by saying the vowel sound _aou_, as if about to yawn.    The tongue must not scrape around upward with its tip. As soon as the  tip has been employed in the pronunciation of the consonants _l_, _n_,  _s_, _t_, and _z_, in which its service is very short and sharp, it  must return to its former position, and keep to it.    It is best to watch the movements of the tongue in the mirror until we  have formed the correct habit permanently. The more elastic the tongue  is in preparing the form for the breath to pass through, the stiller  will it appear, the stiller will it feel to us. It is well, however,  for a considerable time to watch in a mirror all functions of the  organs that can be seen; the expression of the face, the position of  the mouth, and the movement of the lips.          SECTION XI    THE SENSATIONS OF THE PALATE      The sensations of the palate are best made clear to us by raising the  softest part behind the nose. This part is situated very far back. Try  touching it carefully with the finger. This little part is of  immeasurable importance to the singer. By raising it the entire  resonance of the head cavities is brought into play--consequently the  head tones are produced. When it is raised, the pillars of the fauces  are lowered. In its normal position it allows the pillars to be  distended and to close the head cavities off from the throat, in order  to produce the chest tones; that is, to permit the breath to make  fullest use of the palatal resonance. As soon as the soft palate is  lowered under the nose, it makes a point of resonance for the middle  range of voice, by permitting the overtones to resound at the same  time in the nose. (See plate, middle range.)    [Illustration: Red lines denote middle range of soprano, contralto,  and tenor.    In the German names of the notes, _h_ represents _b_ in the English.]    [Illustration: Red line denotes peak, or softest point of the palate.]    Thus the palate performs the whole work so far as concerns the  different resonances, which can be united and separated by it, but  must _always work together in close relation, always bound together in  all tones, in all kinds of voices_.    The lowest chest tones of the bass, the highest head tones of the  soprano, are thus the two poles between which the entire gamut of all  voices can be formed. From this it can be perceived that with a  certain degree of skill and willingness to work, every voice will be  capable of great extension.          SECTION XII    THE SENSATION OF THE RESONANCE OF THE HEAD CAVITIES      The sensation of the resonance of the head cavities is perceived  chiefly by those who are unaccustomed to using the head tones. The  resonance against the occipital walls of the head cavities when the  head tones are employed, at first causes a very marked irritation of  the nerves of the head and ear. But this disappears as soon as the  singer gets accustomed to it. The head tones can be used and directed  by the breath only with a clear head. The least depression such as  comes with headaches, megrim, or moodiness may have the worst effect,  or even make their use quite impossible. This feeling of oppression is  lost after regular, conscious practice, by which all unnecessary and  disturbing pressure is avoided. In singing very high head tones I have  a feeling as if they lay high above the head, as if I were setting  them off into the air. (See plate.)    Here, too, is the explanation of singing _in the neck_. The breath, in  all high tones which are much mixed with head tones or use them  entirely, passes very far back, directly from the throat into the  cavities of the head, and thereby, and through the oblique position of  the larynx, gives rise to the sensations just described. A singer who  inhales and exhales carefully, that is, with knowledge of the  physiological processes, will always have a certain feeling of  pleasure, an attenuation in the throat as if it were stretching itself  upward. The bulging out of veins in the neck, that can so often be  seen in singers, is as wrong as the swelling up of the neck, looks  very ugly, and is not without danger from congestion.    With rapid scales and trills one has the feeling of great firmness of  the throat muscles, as well as of a certain stiffness of the larynx.  (See \"Trills.\") An unsteady movement of the latter, this way and that,  would be disadvantageous to the trill, to rapid scales, as well as to  the cantilena. For this reason, because the changing movements of the  organs must go on quite imperceptibly and inaudibly, it must be more  like a shifting than a movement. In rapid scales the lowest tone must  be \"placed\" with a view to the production of the highest, and in  descending, the greatest care must be exercised that the tone shall  not tumble over each other single, but shall produce the sensation of  closely connected sounds, through being bound to the high tone  position and pressed toward the nose.    In this all the participating vocal organs must be able to keep up a  muscular contraction, often very rigid: a thing that is to be achieved  only gradually through long years of careful and regular study.  Excessive practice is of no use in this--only regular and  intelligent practice; and success comes only in course of time.    [Illustration: Red line denotes vocal sensation of soprano and tenor.]    Never should the muscular contractions become convulsive and produce  pressure which the muscles cannot endure for a long time. They must  respond to all necessary demands upon their strength, yet remain  elastic in order that, easily relaxing or again contracting, they may  promptly adapt themselves to every nuance in tone and accent desired  by the singer.    A singer can become and continue to be master of his voice and means  of expression only as long as he practises daily correct vocal  gymnastics. In this way alone can he obtain unconditional mastery over  his muscles, and, through them, of the finest controlling apparatus,  of the beauty of his voice, as well as of the art of song as a whole.    Training the muscles of the vocal organs so that their power to  contract and relax to all desired degrees of strength, throughout the  entire gamut of the voice, is always at command, makes the master  singer.    As I have already said, the idea of \"singing forward\" leads very many  singers to force the breath from the mouth without permitting it to  make full use of the resonating surfaces that it needs, yet it streams  forth from the larynx really very far back in the throat, and the  straighter it rises in a column behind the tongue, the better it is  for the tone. The tongue must furnish the surrounding form for this,  for which reason it must not lie flat in the mouth. (See plate, the  tongue.)    The whirling currents of tone circling around their focal point (the  attack) find a cup-shaped resonating cavity when they reach the front  of the mouth and the lips, which, through their extremely potent  auxiliary movements, infuse life and color into the tone and the word.  Of equal importance are the unimpeded activity of the whirling  currents of sound and their complete filling of the resonating  spaces in the back of the throat, the pillars of the fauces, and the  head cavities in which the vocalized breath must be kept soaring above  the larynx and _soaring undisturbed_.    In the lowest range of the voice the entire palate from the front  teeth to the rear wall of the throat must be thus filled. (See plate.)    [Illustration: Red lines denote division of the breath in the palatal  resonance: lower range of male and female voices.]    With higher tones the palate is lowered, the nostrils are inflated,  and above the hard palate a passage is formed for the overtones. (See  plate.)    [Illustration: Red lines denote division of the breath in the middle  range and higher middle range.]    This air which soars above must, however, not be in the least  compressed; the higher the tone, the less pressure should there be;  for here, too, whirling currents are formed, which must be neither  interrupted nor destroyed. The breath must be carried along on the  wall of the throat without compression, in order to accomplish its  work. (See plate, high tones.)    [Illustration: Resonance of the cavity of the forehead.    Red lines denote division of the breath in the resonance of the head  cavities, high range.]    Singing forward, then, does not mean pressing the whole of the  _breath_ or the tone forward, but only part of it; that is, in the  middle register, finding a resonating focus in front, caused by the  lowering of the front of the palate. This permits a free course only  to that part of the breath which is used up by the whirling currents  in the resonant throat form, and serves to propagate the outer waves,  and carry them farther through space.          SECTION XIII    SINGING COVERED      We sing covered as soon as the soft palate is lowered toward the nose  (that is, in the middle register), and the resonance and attack are  transferred thither so that the breath can flow over the soft palate  through the nose.    This special function of the palate, too, should be carefully prepared  for in the tones that precede it, and mingled with them, in order not  to be heard so markedly as it often is. In men's voices this is much  more plainly audible than in women's; but both turn it to account  equally on different tones. This often produces a new register that  should not be produced. This belongs to the chapter on registers.    [Music illustration]    The tone is concentrated on the front of the palate instead of being  spread over all of it--but this must not be done too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#8)"],[1,"matter clear. The  organ has many so-called registers, as the _vox humana_, _flute_,  _oboe_, etc. These differ in the character of tone produced, because  of the size and shape of the different sets of pipes and the material,  wood or metal, of which they are made. But each similarly constructed  set of pipes forms only one register, and the pitch of the set varies  from low to high without any abrupt change in quality. All the tones  are produced by the same methods and means, the bellows, the vibrator,  and the pipe. In length and diameter, the pipe is proper to the tone  produced: a short pipe of small diameter for the high tones, and a  long, wide pipe for the bass tones.    The short vibrations of the high tones are perceived by the ear as  affecting the air only, while the tones of the lowest bass pipes  shake the solid foundations as well as the superstructure. So with the  human voice. The coarser tissues cannot answer to the short vibrations  of the upper tones, because they cannot move so quickly, while they  can, and do, respond to the vibrations of the low tones. This may  cause some difference in degree, but not in kind. With all tones  focused alike, the low tones of the human organ may be regarded as  head tones plus the vibrations of the coarser tissues.    It has been said of registers that they are \"acoustic illusions which  disappear in the perfectly trained voice.\" As soon as the singer has  learned to use his voice normally all these defective changes  disappear.      TWO CASES    The following incident illustrates the fact that registers are an  artificial creation: A young lady who had been a patient of the author  since her childhood studied elocution in a metropolitan city, and to  improve her voice took vocal music lessons of a teacher of more than  local repute. He found no end of trouble in teaching her to \"blend the  registers,\" and she had utterly failed to acquire the art. One summer  she came back for professional services and told her troubles. During  the few weeks of her stay she followed the author's suggestions, and  was fully convinced of their correctness and efficiency. Upon  returning to her lessons, she followed, without any explanations, the  method that had been outlined for her. Her success in \"blending the  registers\" was a surprise to her teacher who heartily congratulated  her upon what she had accomplished during the summer.    Another case is that of a young lady who was under the author's  direction as to vocal culture from childhood. As early as four years  of age she was taught by the use of a few exercises to focus the voice  in the nose and head, and to recognize the head vibrations by a light  touch of the finger. When about seven years old, she took ten lessons  of a teacher on the same lines, and at fifteen years of age took  another brief course. In the meantime she had only the practice  obtained by singing with the pupils in the schools she attended.  Later, of her own volition, she sang more, and carefully applied the  principles she had been taught, with the result that her voice  compassed nearly two octaves, evenly and smoothly, with no break or  change of focus or quality, or other intimation of \"register,\" and she  developed a speaking voice of more than ordinary quality and  resonance.    It has also been my lot to aid in the development of the voices of  many patients after a surgical operation for cleft palate. Success has  proven the correctness and efficacy of the principles set forth in  these pages.    A majority of the more than fifty authors whose works I have examined  have laid great stress on the distinction between head and chest  tones, open and closed tones, pure and impure tones, have warned  against the nasal tone, and have constantly advocated a natural tone.  That there is no essential difference between a head tone and a chest  tone has already been discussed and, it would seem, conclusively  proven. Any tone, closed or open, is pure and musical if properly  focused and delivered, and the singer is at liberty to use either upon  any note of the scale if it will serve better to express the sentiment  he wishes to convey to the hearer. The cooing of the love song, the  cry of alarm for help, and the shout of the military charge require  very different qualities of voice to express the feelings, yet each  may be musical and will be so if properly delivered.          CHAPTER VI    RESONANCE IN GENERAL      The intimate relationship existing between voice culture and the  science of acoustics was formerly slightly perceived. The teaching of  singing, as an art, then rested altogether on an empirical basis, and  the acoustics of singing had not received the attention of scientists.    With the publication in 1863 of Helmholtz's great work[4] a new era  began, although singer and scientist yet continue to look upon each  other with suspicion. Teachers of the voice, casting about for a  scientific basis for their work, were greatly impressed with  Helmholtz's revelations in regard to vocal resonance--the fact that  tones are modified in quality as well as increased in power by the  resonance of the air in the cavities of pharynx and head.    [Footnote 4: _Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische  Grundlage fuer die Theorie der Musik._ (The Sensations of Tone as a  Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music.)]    Writing in 1886, Edmund J. Meyer speaks of the importance of a \"study  of the influence of the different resonance cavities as the voice is  colored by one or the other, and the tuning each to each and each to  all\"; yet, he adds, \"the subject is seldom heard of outside of books.\"    The basic importance of resonance in the use of the voice is still too  little recognized, though obvious enough in the construction of  musical instruments. With the exception of a few instruments of  percussion, all musical instruments possess three elements,--a  _motor_, a _vibrator_, and a _resonator_. The violin has the moving  bow for a motor, the strings for a vibrator, and the hollow body for a  resonator. The French horn has the lungs of the performer for a motor,  the lips for a vibrator, and the gradually enlarging tube, terminating  in the flaring bell, for a resonator. In the pianoforte the  hammer-stroke, the strings, and the sounding-board perform the  corresponding offices. Though improvements in other parts of the piano  have done much to increase the volume of the tone, yet in the radical  change of form, size, and other physical qualities of the  sounding-board consists the evolution of the modern pianoforte from  the primitive clavichord.    In all these instruments the quality and power of the tone depend upon  the presence of these three elements,--the perfection of their  construction, their proper relation as to size and position, and the  perfect adaptation of each part. A split sounding-board spoils the  pianoforte, the indented bell destroys the sweet tone of the French  horn, and a cracked fiddle is the synonym for pandemonium itself.    The quality and power of resonance is well illustrated by a  tuning-fork, which, if set in vibration, can, unaided, scarcely be  heard by the person holding it. But if rested on a table, or a plate  of glass, or, better still, on the bridge of a violin, its tones may  be distinctly heard throughout a large hall.    The vibrating violin string when detached from the body of this  instrument, although attuned to pitch, gives absolutely no musical  sound; the lips of the player placed on the mouthpiece detached from  the tube and bell of the brass instrument produce only a splutter; and  a pianoforte without a sounding-board is nil. The air column in the  tube of the French horn, and the sounding-board of the pianoforte  develop the vibrations caused by the lips and strings into musical  tones pleasing to the ear. The tuning-fork alone can scarcely be  heard, while the induced vibrations it sets up through properly  adjusted resonance may be audible far away.    The vocal cords alone cannot make music any more than can the lips of  the cornet player apart from his instrument. _The tone produced by the  vibrations alone of the two very small vocal bands must, in the nature  of things, be very feeble._    Ninety-and-nine persons if asked the question, what produces tone in  the human-voice, would reply, \"the vibrations of the vocal cords,\"  and stop there, as if that were all; whereas the answer is very  incomplete--not even half an answer.    A great deal of the irrational and injurious \"teaching\" of singing  that prevails everywhere, and of the controversy that befogs the  subject, is due to the widely prevalent notion that the little vocal  cords are the principal cause of tone, whereas they are in themselves  insignificant as sound producers.    =It is the vibrations of the air in the resonance chambers of the human  instrument, together with the induced vibrations of the instrument  itself, which give tone its sonority, its reach, its color, and  emotional power.=    That this is not an empirical statement but a scientific fact, a few  simple experiments will demonstrate.    Tone, in the musical sense, is the result of rapid periodic vibration.  The pitch of tone depends upon the _number_ of vibrations in a given  period; the loudness of tone depends upon the _amplitude_ of the  vibrations; the quality of tone depends upon the _form_ of the  vibrations; and the form of the vibrations depends upon the  _resonator_.    The fact that pure white light is a compound of all the tints of the  rainbow into which it may be resolved by the prism is well known, but  the analogous fact that a pure musical tone is a compound of tones of  different rates of vibration, tones of different pitch, is not so much  a matter of common knowledge, and not so obvious.    Analysis shows that a musical tone consists of a fundamental note and  a series of overtones.[5] The ear is quite"]]]
