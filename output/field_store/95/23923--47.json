It  is rather heavy, of hard finish and is used for jackets and winter  suits. To this list of woolen goods may be added the crape cloth with  crinkled, rough surface, nun's veiling, flannel which is woven in a  variety of ways, broadcloth, wool canvas, and poplins. This list  includes only a few of the fabrics manufactured, but these are always to  be found on the market, are always good in color and are the best of all  wool textiles for wear.    [Sidenote: Mohair]    [Sidenote: Alpaca]    Mohair is a material made from the hair of the angora goat, woven with  silk, wool, worsted, or cotton warp. It is a dust-shedding material,  does not shrink, and bears hard wear well. Alpaca, on account of its  softness, elasticity, and exemption from shaggy defects, combines  admirably with cotton in the manufacture of fine goods, which attains  almost the glossy brightness of silk. The yarn is used for weaving  alpaca linings and light coatings for warm climates.      SILKS    Many silks can be washed without injury to the fibers, but they cannot  be boiled without destroying the luster. Silks may be had in various  widths and endless variety of weaves. Many are reversible.    [Sidenote: Loading Silk]    Silks are adulterated with cotton and ramie fibers. The chemicals used  in \"loading\" or \"dynamiting\" to give the weight lost by cleaning or  removing the gum from the raw silk give to the cheaper grades the  stiff, harsh feeling and cause the splitting and cracking of the silk,  hence the quality of the fiber should be considered when selecting a  silk, not the weight. Taffeta is often heavily loaded.    Foulard and surah are twilled silks. Corded silks are woven with a cord  running from selvage to selvage. To this class belong the grosgrains,  Ottoman, faille Francaise--a silk resembling grosgrain, but softer and  brighter. Irish poplins and bengalines have wool for the filling instead  of silk.    [Sidenote: Wash Silks]    Great improvement has been made in the manufacture of wash silks. They  are fine in color and have a glossy surface. Pongee is a beautiful,  durable silk in different shades of natural color. It is woven in  different widths. This silk is especially valuable for underwear. The  first cost is greater, but it outwears muslin or linen. It is also used  for children's garments and for outside wraps. For many purposes, no  better textile can be found.    Crepe de Chine is an incomparable textile possessing as much softness as  strength. It is always supple, never creases, launders well, and comes  in the most beautiful soft shades as well as in black and dark colors.    Satin is distinguished by its glossy, lustrous surface, obtained in the  weaving.    [Sidenote: Piled Fabrics]    Piled fabrics are rich, thick materials made of silk, wool, mohair, and  cotton, comprising the velvets, velveteens, plushes, corduroys, and  wilton and velvet carpets. The soft, raised pile is first woven in  loops--Brussels carpet is a good example--and the loops are cut. The  back of the goods is plain.    [Sidenote: Velvet]    Velvet has always and justly been regarded as the most beautiful of  textiles. No matter how fashions change in regard to other materials,  velvet never loses its vogue. For robes and cloaks, for mantles and  jackets, for hats and bonnets, for trimming and decoration, velvet has  been popular for a greater period than the life of any living mortal,  but never before has it been so cheap, so varied and so beautiful as it  is now. One can in the passing throng of pedestrians on any crowded  street see the use and abuse of this noble material. There is scarcely  an article of dress into whose composition it does not enter and it is  worn upon all occasions. Many things have brought about this result. The  tendency of fashion is towards the decorative and picturesque and in  these qualities velvet excels all other fabrics. Silk waste and thread  are cheaper than ever before so that velvet costs much less than  formerly. The men behind the looms have evolved more designs and  novelties in the making of velvet than has ever been known and colors  beautiful in themselves are seemingly enhanced when applied to velvet.    [Sidenote: Velveteen]    All that has been said in favor of velvet applies equally as well to the  best velveteen,--in fact it is a textile of even greater value and  beauty than velvet. The best grades are not cheap, but they wear better  than silk velvet, are fine and silky, excellent in color and sheen,  launder well, and do not press-mark as does silk velvet. Velveteen takes  the dye so beautifully and finishes so well that it has taken rank with  our best standard fabrics. It is made entirely of cotton. It varies in  width but is always wider than velvet.    [Sidenote: Widths of Fabrics]    A knowledge of the various widths of textiles is important in buying.  Transparent fabrics are usually wider than heavier goods made of the  same fiber. Muslin is wider than calico or ordinary print, and thin silk  fabrics such as mull and chiffon are wider than velvet.    In wool dress goods various distinct widths are known as single--thirty  and thirty-six inches--double fold (forty-five and fifty-four inches),  etc. Silk, velvet, and velveteen are single width. The velvet ranges  from eighteen to twenty-four inches in width and velveteen twenty-seven.  Bodice linings vary from thirty-five to thirty-eight inches; skirt  linings come in both single and double fold.    Household linen including bedding varies in width from one yard to two  and one-fourth and two and one-half yards for sheeting and from  thirty-eight to fifty-four inches for pillow case muslin.    Table linen is woven in both square and circular cloths of various  sizes, and napkins vary in width from the small sizes to a yard square.    No fixed widths can be given for any textile as width often changes with  the weave.      NAMES OF FABRICS    Textiles usually take their names from the country, city, port, or  province from whence they originated; from the names of the makers; and  methods of weaving, dyeing, ornamentation, etc. The fixing of  localities, methods, etc., is oftentimes guesswork. The textiles of  to-day bearing the same name as those of the middle ages have nothing in  common. Buckram was originally made in and called from Bokkara. In the  middle ages it was costly, fine, and beautiful, used for church  vestments, veils for covering lecterns, cathedral flags, and in the 16th  century for the lining of velvet gowns. The coarse, heavy, plain-woven  linen or cotton material known as buckram today is used for stiffening,  etc.    [Sidenote: Fustian]    Fustian, a kind of corduroy or velveteen, was originally woven at Fustat  on the Nile. The warp was stout linen, the woof of cotton so twilled and  cut that it gave a low thick pile. Chaucer's knight in the fourteenth  century wore fustian. In the fifteenth century Naples was famous for the  weaving of fustians.    A cloth made in France at a town called Mustrevilliers was known as  \"mustyrd devells.\"    [Sidenote: Damask]    China is supposed to be the first country to weave patterned silks.  India, Persia, Syria, and Byzantine Greece followed. Those were known as  \"diaspron\" or diaper, a name given them at Constantinople. In the  twelfth century, the city of Damascus, long famed for her beautiful  textiles, outstripped all other places for beauty of design and gave the  Damascen or damask, so we have in modern times all fabrics whether of  silk, cotton, wool, or linen, curiously woven and designed, known as  damask, and diaper, which means pattern, is almost forgotten, or only a  part of the elaborate design on damask. Bandekin, a costly cloth, took  its name from Bagdad. Dorneck an inferior damask woven of silk, wool,  linen, thread and gold, was made in Flanders at the city of Dorneck.    [Sidenote: Muslin]    From the Asiatic city Mosul came the muslin used then as it is now  throughout the world. So skilled were its weavers that the threads were  of hair-like fineness. This was known as the invisible muslin, the  weaving of which has become a lost art. To this beautiful cloth were  given many fanciful and poetic names. It was woven with strips of gold  and silver.    [Sidenote: Calico]    Calico derives its name from the city of Calicut in India. The city is  scarcely known to-day; it was the first Indian city visited by  Europeans.    In the thirteenth century Arras was famous for its areste or tapestry,  \"the noblest of the weaving arts\"; in it there is nothing mechanical.  Mechanical weaving repeats the pattern on the cloth within comparatively  narrow limits and the number of colors is in most cases limited to four  or five.    Silks and cottons are distinguished through their colors and shades.  Tarsus was a purple silk. Other cities gave their name to various  shades, according as they were dyed at Antioch, Alexandria, or at  Naples. Watered or moire silk takes its name from the finish.    From \"canabis,\" the Latin name for hemp or flax, we have the word  \"canvas\" to mean any texture woven of hempen thread.    To this list of fabrics might be added many others of cotton, linen,  wool, and silk with new names, closely resembling the old materials,  having greater or less merit.    The following lists of fabrics and terms may be helpful for reference:         Art linen--With round, hard twisted threads.         \"Albert cloth\"--Named for England's prince, is a reversible       all-wool material each side of different colors and so finished       that no lining is required. It is used chiefly for overcoats and       better known as \"golf cloth,\" \"plaid back,\" etc.         Armure--A cloth woven in miniature imitation of feudal metal armor       plates, heraldic devices, diamonds, birdseye, and seeded effects.         Astrakhan--A woolen or silk material with a long and closely "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2157"],[0,"Female Suffrage: A Letter to the Christian Women of America (#8)"],[1,"country there are many individuals,  especially among women, to whom social life practically bears that  meaning. Public worship itself is a social act, the highest of all,  blending in one the spirit of the two great commandments--the love of  God and the love of man. And whatever of social action or social  enjoyment is not inconsistent with those two great commandments becomes  the Christian's heritage, makes a part, more or less important, of his  education, enters into the great stream of the better civilization. And  it is here that we reach what may be called the more public duties of  woman. From all duties entirely public she is now, or she may be if she  choose, relieved by man. These more public duties of hers are still but  the outgrowth of her home life, and more or less closely interwoven  with it. They are very important, never to be neglected with impunity.  The really unsocial woman is in great danger of becoming also  un-christian. Every friend crossing the threshold brings social life  into the home. The genial smile, the kindly greeting, the cheering  word, all these and a thousand other gracious impulses, are, of course,  but the first instinctive movements of the social feeling. And from  these we move onward over a vast field of action, to the very farthest  point reached by the higher charities of Christianity. There can be no  doubt that the charm, the grace, and the happy cheerfulness of society  are chiefly due to women; and it is also true that the whole unwritten  common-law of society is, in a great measure, under their control. The  world is constantly encroaching here, enervating and corrupting social  life. To oppose wisely, skillfully, and effectually these treacherous  encroachments, these alluring temptations, is one of the most difficult  tasks possible. To contribute her full share toward purifying and  brightening the social atmosphere about her, in accordance with the  spirit of true Christian civilization, such is one great and essential  part of woman's work in life. It is a work more especially her own.  Man, without his helpmeet, can do but little here. His faculties are  absorbed by other tasks, not more important, but more engrossing and  essentially different. The finer tact, the more graceful manner, the  quicker wit, the more tender conscience, are all needed here. Every  woman in the country has her own share of this work to do. Each  individual woman is responsible for the right use of all her own social  influences, whether for good or for evil.    To keep up the standard of female purity becomes emphatically one of  the most stringent duties of every Christian woman. For her own sake,  for the sake of all she loves, for the sake of her country, for the  service of Christ and His Church, she is bound to uphold this standard  at a high point--a point entirely above suspicion. This task is of  importance incalculable. But, owing to the frivolity of some women, and  the very loose ideas of many men, it is no easy task. Undoubtedly, the  very great majority of women are born modest at heart. Their nature is  by many degrees less coarse than that of man. And their conscience is  more tender. But there is one temptation to which they too often yield.  With them the great dangers are vanity and the thirst for admiration,  which often become a sort of diseased excitement--what drinking or  gambling is to men. Here is the weak point. Yielding chiefly to this  temptation, scores of women are falling every day. Vanity leads them to  wear the extravagant, the flashy, the immodest, the unhealthy dress, to  dance the immodest dance, to adopt the alluring manner, to carry  flirting to extremes. Vanity leads them, in short, to forget true  self-respect, to enjoy the very doubtful compliment of a miserably  cheap admiration. They become impatient of the least appearance of  neglect or indifference, they become eager in pursuit of attention,  while men always attribute that pursuit to motives of the coarsest  kind. It is generally vanity alone which leads a married woman to  receive the first disgraceful flattery of dissolute men. Probably nine  out of ten of those American women who have trifled with honor and  reputation, whose names are spoken with the sneer of contempt, have  been led on, step by step, in the path of sin by vanity as the chief  motive. Where one woman falls from low and coarse passions, a hundred  fall from sheer levity and the love of admiration.    To counteract this fatal influence young women must be taught to  respect themselves, to be on their guard against vanity and its  enticements, to cherish personal modesty in every way. The married  woman who is quietly working by example or by precept among the young  girls nearest to her, seeking to cherish and foster among them this  vital principle of pure personal modesty in dress, in language, in  reading, in tone of voice, in countenance, in manner--the natural  outward expression of true modesty of heart--is doing far more for her  country than if she were to mount the rostrum to-morrow and make a  political speech eloquent as any of Webster's.    Sensible women may always have a good measure of political influence of  the right sort, if they choose. And it is in one sense a duty on their  part to claim this influence, and to exert it, but always in the true  womanly way. The influence of good sense, of a sound judgment, of good  feeling may always he theirs. Let us see that we preserve this  influence, and that we use it wisely. But let us cherish our happy  immunities as women by keeping aloof from all public personal action in  the political field. There is much higher work for us to do. Our time,  our thoughts, our efforts may be given to labors far more important  than any mere temporary electing, or law-making, passed today, annulled  to-morrow, in obedience to the fickle spirit of party politics.      THAT WORK IS TO PROMOTE BY ALL WORTHY MEANS THE MORAL CIVILIZATION OF  THE COUNTRY.    Toward this work legislation, the mere enacting of laws, can do but  little. We have all heard of the shrewd mind who considered the songs  of a people as more important than their laws. The moral condition of a  nation is subject to many different influences--of these the statute  book is but one, and that not the most important. No mere skeleton of  political constitution can, of itself, produce moral health and  strength. It is the living heart within which does the work. And over  that heart women have very great influence. The home is the cradle of  the nation. A sound home education is the most important of all moral  influences. In the very powerful influences which affection gives them  over the home, by teaching childhood, by guiding youth, over the men of  their family, women have noble means for working good, not only to  their own households, not only to the social circle about them, but to  the nation at large. All these influences they can bring into action  far more effectually by adhering closely to that position which is not  only natural to them, but also plainly allotted to them by the revealed  Word of God. In no position of their own devising can they do that work  half so well.    Political and social corruption are clearly the great evils to be  dreaded for our country. We have already gone far enough in the path of  universal manhood suffrage to feel convinced that no mere enlargement  of the suffrage has power to save us from those evils. During half a  century we have been moving nearer and nearer to a suffrage all but  universal, and we have, during the same period, been growing more  corrupt. The undisguised frauds at elections, the open accusations of  bribery in legislative assemblies, the accusations of corruption  connected with still higher offices--of these we read daily in the  public prints. And these accusations are not disproved. They are  generally believed. It is clear, therefore, that something more  effectual than universal manhood suffrage is needed to stem the  torrent. And it is simply ridiculous to suppose that womanhood suffrage  can effect the same task. Who can believe that where men, in their own  natural field, have partially failed to preserve a healthful political  atmosphere, an honest political practice, that women, so much less  experienced, physically so much more feeble, so excitable, so liable to  be misled by fancy, by feeling, are likely, in a position foreign to  their nature, not only to stand upright themselves, but, like Atlas of  old, to bear the weight of the whole political world on their  shoulders--like Hercules, to cleanse the Augean stables of the  political coursers--to do, in short, all that man has failed to do? No;  it is, alas! only too clear that something more than the ballot-box,  whether in male or female hands, is needed here. And it is the same in  social life. The public prints, under a free press, must always hold up  a tolerably faithful mirror to the society about them. The picture it  displays is no better in social life than in political life. We say the  mirror is tolerably faithful, since there are heights of virtue and  depths of sin alike unreflected by the daily press. The very purest and  the very foulest elements of earthly existence are left out of the  picture. But the general view can scarcely fail to be tolerably  correct. Take, then, the sketch of social life as it appears in some  half dozen of the most popular prints from week to week. You will be  sure to find the better features grievously blended with others  fearfully distorted by evil. There are blots black as pitch in that  picture. There are forms, more fiend-like than human, photographed on  those sheets of paper. Crimes of worse than brutal violence, savage  cruelty, crimes of treachery and cowardly cunning and conspiracy,  breach of trust, tyrannical extortion, groveling intemperance,  sensuality gross and shameless--the heart sickens at the"]]]
