Saints are men who have freed themselves from the world of matter and who  have overcome sin. They live in the world but are not of it, their  thoughts being continually in the world of the spirit. Their lives are  spent in holiness, and their deeds show forth love, justice and godliness.  They are illumined from on high; they are as bright and shining lamps in  the dark places of the earth. These are the saints of God. The apostles,  who were the disciples of Jesus Christ, were just as other men are; they,  like their fellows, were attracted by the things of the world, and each  thought only of his own advantage. They knew little of justice, nor were  the Divine perfections found in their midst. But when they followed Christ  and believed in Him, their ignorance gave place to understanding, cruelty  was changed to justice, falsehood to truth, darkness into light. They had  been worldly, they became spiritual and divine. They had been children of  darkness, they became sons of God, they became saints! Strive therefore to  follow in their steps, leaving all worldly things behind, and striving to  attain to the Spiritual Kingdom.    Pray to God that He may strengthen you in divine virtue, so that you may  be as angels in the world, and beacons of light to disclose the mysteries  of the Kingdom to those with understanding hearts.    God sent His Prophets into the world to teach and enlighten man, to  explain to him the mystery of the Power of the Holy Spirit, to enable him  to reflect the light, and so in his turn, to be the source of guidance to  others. The Heavenly Books, the Bible, the Qur'an, and the other Holy  Writings have been given by God as guides into the paths of Divine virtue,  love, justice and peace.    Therefore I say unto you that ye should strive to follow the counsels of  these Blessed Books, and so order your lives that ye may, following the  examples set before you, become yourselves the saints of the Most High!          MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL PROGRESS      November 2nd    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    How beautiful the weather is today, the sky is clear, the sun shines, and  the heart of man is made glad thereby!    Such bright and beautiful weather gives new life and strength to man, and  if he has been sick, he feels once more in his heart the joyous hope of  health renewed. All these gifts of nature concern the physical side of  man, for it is only his body that can receive material benefits.    If a man is successful in his business, art, or profession he is thereby  enabled to increase his physical wellbeing and to give his body the amount  of ease and comfort in which it delights. All around us today we see how  man surrounds himself with every modern convenience and luxury, and denies  nothing to the physical and material side of his nature. But, take heed,  lest in thinking too earnestly of the things of the body you forget the  things of the soul: for material advantages do not elevate the spirit of a  man. Perfection in worldly things is a joy to the body of a man but in no  wise does it glorify his soul.    It may be that a man who has every material benefit, and who lives  surrounded by all the greatest comfort modern civilization can give him,  is denied the all important gift of the Holy Spirit.    It is indeed a good and praiseworthy thing to progress materially, but in  so doing, let us not neglect the more important spiritual progress, and  close our eyes to the Divine light shining in our midst.    Only by improving spiritually as well as materially can we make any real  progress, and become perfect beings. It was in order to bring this  spiritual life and light into the world that all the great Teachers have  appeared. They came so that the Sun of Truth might be manifested, and  shine in the hearts of men, and that through its wondrous power men might  attain unto Everlasting Light.    When the Lord Christ came He spread the light of the Holy Spirit on all  around Him, and His disciples and all who received His illumination became  enlightened, spiritual beings.    It was to manifest this light that Baha'u'llah was born, and came into the  world. He taught Eternal Truth to men, and shed the rays of Divine Light  in all lands.    Alas! behold how man disregards this Light. He still goes on his way of  darkness, and disunity, and quarrels and fierce war are still rife.    He uses material progress to gratify his lust for war, and he makes  destructive implements and appliances to destroy his brother man.    But let us rather exert ourselves for the attainment of spiritual  advantages, for this is the only way of true progress, that which cometh  from God and is alone Godly.    I pray for you one and all that you may receive the Bounties of the Holy  Spirit; so will you become in truth enlightened, and progress ever onward  and upward to the Kingdom of God. Then shall your hearts be prepared to  receive the glad tidings, your eyes shall be opened and you will see the  Glory of God; your ears shall be unstopped and you will hear the call of  the Kingdom, and with tongue made eloquent shall you call men to the  realization of the Divine Power and Love of God!          THE EVOLUTION OF MATTER AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL      November 3rd    Paris is becoming very cold, so cold that I shall soon be obliged to go  away, but the warmth of your love still keeps me here. God willing, I hope  to stay among you yet a little while; bodily cold and heat cannot affect  the spirit, for it is warmed by the fire of the Love of God. When we  understand this, we begin to understand something of our life in the world  to come.    God, in His Bounty, has given us a foretaste here, has given us certain  proofs of the difference that exists between body, soul and spirit.    We see that cold, heat, suffering, etc, only concern the body, they do not  touch the spirit.    How often do we see a man, poor, sick, miserably clad, and with no means  of support, yet spiritually strong. Whatever his body has to suffer, his  spirit is free and well! Again, how often do we see a rich man, physically  strong and healthy, but with a soul sick unto death.    It is quite apparent to the seeing mind that a man's spirit is something  very different from his physical body.    The spirit is changeless, indestructible. The progress and development of  the soul, the joy and sorrow of the soul, are independent of the physical  body.    If we are caused joy or pain by a friend, if a love prove true or false,  it is the soul that is affected. If our dear ones are far from us--it is  the soul that grieves, and the grief or trouble of the soul may react on  the body.    Thus, when the spirit is fed with holy virtues, then is the body joyous;  if the soul falls into sin, the body is in torment!    When we find truth, constancy, fidelity, and love, we are happy; but if we  meet with lying, faithlessness, and deceit, we are miserable.    These are all things pertaining to the soul, and are not bodily ills.  Thus, it is apparent that the soul, even as the body, has its own  individuality. But if the body undergoes a change, the spirit need not be  touched. When you break a glass on which the sun shines, the glass is  broken, but the sun still shines! If a cage containing a bird is  destroyed, the bird is unharmed! If a lamp is broken, the flame can still  burn bright!    The same thing applies to the spirit of man. Though death destroy his  body, it has no power over his spirit--this is eternal, everlasting, both  birthless and deathless.    As to the soul of man after death, it remains in the degree of purity to  which it has evolved during life in the physical body, and after it is  freed from the body it remains plunged in the ocean of God's Mercy.    From the moment the soul leaves the body and arrives in the Heavenly  World, its evolution is spiritual, and that evolution is: The approaching  unto God.    In the physical creation, evolution is from one degree of perfection to  another. The mineral passes with its mineral perfections to the vegetable;  the vegetable, with its perfections, passes to the animal world, and so on  to that of humanity. This world is full of seeming contradictions; in each  of these kingdoms (mineral, vegetable and animal) life exists in its  degree; though when compared to the life in a man, the earth appears to be  dead, yet she, too, lives and has a life of her own. In this world things  live and die, and live again in other forms of life, but in the world of  the spirit it is quite otherwise.    The soul does not evolve from degree to degree as a law--it only evolves  nearer to God, by the Mercy and Bounty of God.    It is my earnest prayer that we may all be in the Kingdom of God, and near  Him.          THE SPIRITUAL MEETINGS IN PARIS      November 4th    All over Europe today one hears of meetings and assemblies, and societies  of all kinds are formed. There are those interested in commerce, science,  and politics, and many others. All these are for material service, their  desire being for the progress and enlightenment of the world of matter.  But rarely does a breath from the spirit world breathe upon them. They  seem unconscious of the Divine Voice, careless concerning the things of  God. But this meeting in Paris is a truly spiritual one. The Divine Breath  is poured forth in your midst, the light of the Kingdom is shining in all  hearts. The Divine love of God is a power among you, and with souls  athirst, ye receive the glad tidings of great joy.    You are all met here with one accord, heart drawn to heart, souls  overflowing with Divine love, working and longing for the unity of the  world.    Verily this assembly is a spiritual one! It is like unto a beautiful  perfumed garden! On it the Heavenly Sun sheds the golden rays, and the  warmth thereof penetrates and gladdens each waiting heart. The love of  Christ, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#8)"],[1," are variegated,  it is most pleasing and wonderful. The difference in adornment of color  and capacity of reflection among the flowers gives the garden its beauty  and charm. Therefore, although we are of different individualities,  different in ideas and of various fragrances, let us strive like flowers  of the same divine garden to live together in harmony. Even though each  soul has its own individual perfume and color, all are reflecting the same  light, all contributing fragrance to the same breeze which blows through  the garden, all continuing to grow in complete harmony and accord. Become  as waves of one sea, trees of one forest, growing in the utmost love,  agreement and unity.    If you attain to such a capacity of love and unity, the Blessed Perfection  will shower infinite graces of the spiritual Kingdom upon you, guide,  protect and preserve you under the shadow of His Word, increase your  happiness in this world and uphold you through all difficulties.  Therefore, it is my hope that day by day you will become more and more  effulgent in the horizon of heaven, advance nearer and nearer toward the  Kingdom of Abha, attain greater and greater bounties of the Blessed  Perfection. I am joyful, for I perceive the evidences of great love among  you. I go to Chicago, and when I return I hope that love will have become  infinite. Then will it be an eternal joy to me and the friends in the  Orient.          18 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Marshall L. Emery  273 West Ninetieth Street, New York      Notes by Miss Dixon    Tonight I wish to tell you something of the history of the Baha'i  Revelation.    The Blessed Perfection, Baha'u'llah, belonged to the nobility of Persia.  From earliest childhood He was distinguished among His relatives and  friends. They said, \"This child has extraordinary power.\" In wisdom,  intelligence and as a source of new knowledge, He was advanced beyond His  age and superior to His surroundings. All who knew Him were astonished at  His precocity. It was usual for them to say, \"Such a child will not live,\"  for it is commonly believed that precocious children do not reach  maturity. During the period of youth the Blessed Perfection did not enter  school. He was not willing to be taught. This fact is well established  among the Persians of Tihran. Nevertheless, He was capable of solving the  difficult problems of all who came to Him. In whatever meeting, scientific  assembly or theological discussion He was found, He became the authority  of explanation upon intricate and abstruse questions presented.    Until His father passed away, Baha'u'llah did not seek position or  political station notwithstanding His connection with the government. This  occasioned surprise and comment. It was frequently said, \"How is it that a  young man of such keen intelligence and subtle perception does not seek  lucrative appointments? As a matter of fact, every position is open to  him.\" This is an historical statement fully attested by the people of  Persia.    He was most generous, giving abundantly to the poor. None who came to Him  were turned away. The doors of His house were open to all. He always had  many guests. This unbounded generosity was conducive to greater  astonishment from the fact that He sought neither position nor prominence.  In commenting upon this His friends said He would become impoverished, for  His expenses were many and His wealth becoming more and more limited. \"Why  is he not thinking of his own affairs?\" they inquired of each other; but  some who were wise declared, \"This personage is connected with another  world; he has something sublime within him that is not evident now; the  day is coming when it will be manifested.\" In truth, the Blessed  Perfection was a refuge for every weak one, a shelter for every fearing  one, kind to every indigent one, lenient and loving to all creatures.    He became well-known in regard to these qualities before the Bab appeared.  Then Baha'u'llah declared the Bab's mission to be true and promulgated His  teachings. The Bab announced that the greater Manifestation would take  place after Him and called the Promised One \"Him Whom God shall make  manifest,\" saying that nine years later the reality of His own mission  would become apparent. In His writings He stated that in the ninth year  this expected One would be known; in the ninth year they would attain to  all glory and felicity; in the ninth year they would advance rapidly.  Between Baha'u'llah and the Bab there was communication privately. The Bab  wrote a letter containing three hundred and sixty derivatives of the root  Baha. The Bab was martyred in Tabriz; and Baha'u'llah, exiled into 'Iraq  in 1852, announced Himself in Ba_gh_dad. For the Persian government had  decided that as long as He remained in Persia the peace of the country  would be disturbed; therefore, He was exiled in the expectation that  Persia would become quiet. His banishment, however, produced the opposite  effect. New tumult arose, and the mention of His greatness and influence  spread everywhere throughout the country. The proclamation of His  manifestation and mission was made in Ba_gh_dad. He called His friends  together there and spoke to them of God.    At one point He left the city and went alone into the mountains of  Kurdistan, where He made His abode in caves and grottoes. A part of this  time He lived in the city of Sulaymaniyyih. Two years passed during which  neither His friends nor family knew just where He was.    Although Baha'u'llah was solitary, secluded and unknown in His retirement,  the report spread throughout Kurdistan that this was a most remarkable and  learned Personage, gifted with a wonderful power of attraction. In a short  time Kurdistan was magnetized with His love. During this period  Baha'u'llah lived in poverty. His garments were those of the poor and  needy. His food was that of the indigent and lowly. An atmosphere of  majesty haloed Him as the sun at midday. Everywhere He was greatly revered  and beloved.    After two years He returned to Ba_gh_dad. Friends He had known in  Sulaymaniyyih came to visit Him. They found Him in His accustomed  environment of ease and affluence and were astonished at the appointments  of One Who had lived in seclusion under such frugal conditions in  Kurdistan.    The Persian government believed the banishment of the Blessed Perfection  from Persia would be the extermination of His Cause in that country. These  rulers now realized that it spread more rapidly. His prestige increased;  His teachings became more widely circulated. The chiefs of Persia then  used their influence to have Baha'u'llah exiled from Ba_gh_dad. He was  summoned to Constantinople by the Turkish authorities. While in  Constantinople He ignored every restriction, especially the hostility of  ministers of state and clergy. The official representatives of Persia  again brought their influence to bear upon the Turkish authorities and  succeeded in having Baha'u'llah banished from Constantinople to  Adrianople, the object being to keep Him as far away as possible from  Persia and render His communication with that country more difficult.  Nevertheless, the Cause still spread and strengthened.    Finally, they consulted together and said, \"We have banished Baha'u'llah  from place to place, but each time he is exiled his cause is more widely  extended, his proclamation increases in power, and day by day his lamp is  becoming brighter. This is due to the fact that we have exiled him to  large cities and populous centers. Therefore, we will send him to a penal  colony as a prisoner so that all may know he is the associate of  murderers, robbers and criminals; in a short time he and his followers  will perish.\" The Sultan of Turkey then banished Him to the prison of Akka  in Syria.    When Baha'u'llah arrived at Akka, through the power of God He was able to  hoist His banner. His light at first had been a star; now it became a  mighty sun, and the illumination of His Cause expanded from the East to  the West. Inside prison walls He wrote Epistles to all the kings and  rulers of nations, summoning them to arbitration and universal peace. Some  of the kings received His words with disdain and contempt. One of these  was the Sultan of the Ottoman kingdom. Napoleon III of France did not  reply. A second Epistle was addressed to him. It stated, \"I have written  you an Epistle before this, summoning you to the Cause of God, but you are  of the heedless. You have proclaimed that you were the defender of the  oppressed; now it hath become evident that you are not. Nor are you kind  to your own suffering and oppressed people. Your actions are contrary to  your own interests, and your kingly pride must fall. Because of your  arrogance God shortly will destroy your sovereignty. France will flee away  from you, and you will be overwhelmed by a great conquest. There will be  lamentation and mourning, women bemoaning the loss of their sons.\" This  arraignment of Napoleon III was published and spread.    Read it and consider: one prisoner, single and solitary, without assistant  or defender, a foreigner and stranger imprisoned in the fortress of Akka,  writing such letters to the Emperor of France and Sultan of Turkey.  Reflect upon this: how Baha'u'llah upraised the standard of His Cause in  prison. Refer to history. It is without parallel. No such thing has  happened before that time nor since--a prisoner and an exile advancing His  Cause and spreading His teachings broadcast so that eventually He became  powerful enough to conquer the very king who banished Him.    His Cause spread more and more. The Blessed Perfection was a prisoner  twenty-five years. During all this time He was subjected to the  indignities and revilement of the people. He was persecuted, mocked and  put in chains. In Persia His properties were pillaged and His possessions  confiscated. First, there was banishment"]]]
