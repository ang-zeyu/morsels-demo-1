[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#8)"],[1," he  had the roll in his hand; in two minutes he was speeding to the office  of the Company, for there was a fat tip in view. There he learned that  Arnaux had made the two hundred and ten miles in fog, over sea, in four  hours and forty minutes, and within one hour the needful help had set  out for the unfortunate steamer.    Two hundred and ten miles in fog over sea in four hours and forty  minutes! This was a noble record. It was duly inscribed in the rolls of  the Homing Club. Arnaux was held while the secretary, with rubber stamp  and indelible ink, printed on a snowy primary of his right wing the  record of the feat, with the date and reference number.    Starback, the second bird, never was heard of again. No doubt he  perished at sea.    Blue Corner-box came back on the tug.      III    That was Arnaux's first public record; but others came fast, and  several curious scenes were enacted in that old pigeon-loft with Arnaux  as the central figure. One day a carriage drove up to the stable; a  white-haired gentleman got out, climbed the dusty stairs, and sat all  morning in the loft with Billy. Peering from his gold-rimmed glasses,  first at a lot of papers, next across the roofs of the city, waiting,  watching, for what? News from a little place not forty miles away--news  of greatest weight to him, tidings that would make or break him,  tidings that must reach him before it could be telegraphed: a telegram  meant at least an hour's delay at each end. What was faster than that  for forty miles? In those days there was but one thing--a high-class  Homer. Money would count for nothing if he could win. The best, the  very best at any price he must have, and Arnaux, with seven indelible  records on his pinions, was the chosen messenger. An hour went by,  another, and a third was begun, when with whistle of wings, the blue  meteor flashed into the loft. Billy slammed the door and caught him.  Deftly he snipped the threads and handed the roll to the banker. The  old man turned deathly pale, fumbled it open, then his color came back.  \"Thank God!\" he gasped, and then went speeding to his Board meeting,  master of the situation. Little Arnaux had saved him.    The banker wanted to buy the Homer, feeling in a vague way that he  ought to honor and cherish him; but Billy was very clear about it.  \"What's the good? You can't buy a Homer's heart. You could keep him a  prisoner, that's all; but nothing on earth could make him forsake the  old loft where he was hatched.\" So Arnaux stayed at 211 West Nineteenth  Street. But the banker did not forget.    There is in our country a class of miscreants who think a flying Pigeon  is fair game, because it is probably far from home, or they shoot him  because it is hard to fix the crime. Many a noble Homer, speeding with  a life or death message, has been shot down by one of these wretches  and remorselessly made into a pot-pie. Arnaux's brother Arnolf, with  three fine records on his wings, was thus murdered in the act of  bearing a hasty summons for the doctor. As he fell dying at the  gunner's feet, his superb wings spread out displayed his list of  victories. The silver badge on his leg was there, and the gunner was  smitten with remorse. He had the message sent on; he returned the dead  bird to the Homing Club, saying that he \"found it.\" The owner came to  see him; the gunner broke down under cross-examination, and was forced  to admit that he himself had shot the Homer, but did so in behalf of a  poor sick neighbor who craved a pigeon-pie.    There were tears in the wrath of the pigeon-man. \"My bird, my beautiful  Arnolf, twenty times has he brought vital messages, three times has he  made records, twice has he saved human lives, and you'd shoot him for a  pot-pie. I could punish you under the law, but I have no heart for such  a poor revenge. I only ask you this, if ever again you have a sick  neighbor who wants a pigeon-pie, come, we'll freely supply him with  pie-breed squabs; but if you have a trace of manhood about you, you  will never, never again shoot, or allow others to shoot, our noble and  priceless messengers.\"    This took place while the banker was in touch with the loft, while his  heart was warm for the Pigeons. He was a man of influence, and the  Pigeon Protective legislation at Albany was the immediate fruit of  Arnaux's exploit.      IV    Billy had never liked the Corner-box Blue (2600 C); notwithstanding the  fact that he still continued in the ranks of the Silver Badge, Billy  believed he was poor stuff. The steamer incident seemed to prove him  coward; he certainly was a bully.    One morning when Billy went in there was a row, two Pigeons, a large  and a small, alternately clinching and sparring all over the floor,  feathers flying, dust and commotion everywhere. As soon as they were  separated Billy found that the little one was Arnaux and the big one  was the Corner-box Blue. Arnaux had made a good fight, but was  overmatched, for the Big Blue was half as heavy again.    Soon it was very clear what they had fought over--a pretty little lady  Pigeon of the bluest Homing blood. The Big Blue cock had kept up a  state of bad feeling by his bullying, but it was the Little Lady that  had made them close in mortal combat. Billy had no authority to wring  the Big Blue's neck, but he interfered as far as he could in behalf of  his favorite Arnaux.    Pigeon marriages are arranged somewhat like those of mankind.  Propinquity is the first thing: force the pair together for a time and  let nature take its course. So Billy locked Arnaux and the Little Lady  up together in a separate apartment for two weeks, and to make doubly  sure he locked Big Blue up with an Available Lady in another apartment  for two weeks.    Things turned out just as was expected. The Little Lady surrendered to  Arnaux and the Available Lady to the Big Blue. Two nests were begun and  everything shaped for a \"lived happily ever after.\" But the Big Blue  was very big and handsome. He could blow out his crop and strut in the  sun and make rainbows all round his neck in a way that might turn the  heart of the staidest Homerine.    Arnaux, though sturdily built, was small and except for his brilliant  eyes, not especially good-looking. Moreover, he was often away on  important business, and the Big Blue had nothing to do but stay around  the loft and display his unlettered wings.    It is the custom of moralists to point to the lower animals, and  especially to the Pigeon, for examples of love and constancy, and  properly so, but, alas there are exceptions. Vice is not by any means  limited to the human race.    Arnaux's wife had been deeply impressed with the Big Blue, at the  outset, and at length while her spouse was absent the dreadful thing  took place.    Arnaux returned from Boston one day to find that the Big Blue, while he  retained his own Available Lady in the corner-box, had also annexed the  box and wife that belonged to himself, and a desperate battle followed.  The only spectators were the two wives, but they maintained an  indifferent aloofness. Arnaux fought with his famous wings, but they  were none the better weapons because they now bore twenty records. His  beak and feet were small, as became his blood, and his stout little  heart could not make up for his lack of weight. The battle went against  him. His wife sat unconcernedly in the nest, as though it were not her  affair, and Arnaux might have been killed but for the timely arrival of  Billy. He was angry enough to wring the Blue bird's neck, but the bully  escaped from the loft in time. Billy took tender care of Arnaux for a  few days. At the end of a week he was well again, and in ten days he  was once more on the road. Meanwhile he had evidently forgiven his  faithless wife, for, without any apparent feeling, he took up his  nesting as before. That month he made two new records. He brought a  message ten miles in eight minutes, and he came from Boston in four  hours. Every moment of the way he had been impelled by the  master-passion of home-love. But it was a poor home-coming if his wife  figured at all in his thoughts, for he found her again flirting with  the Big Blue cock. Tired as he was, the duel was renewed, and again  would have been to a finish but for Billy's interference. He separated  the fighters, then shut the Blue cock up in a coop, determined to get  rid of him in some way. Meanwhile the \"Any Age Sweepstakes\" handicap  from Chicago to New York was on, a race of nine hundred miles. Arnaux  had been entered six months before. His forfeit-money was up, and  notwithstanding his domestic complications, his friends felt that he  must not fail to appear.    The birds were sent by train to Chicago, to be liberated at intervals  there according to their handicap, and last of the start was Arnaux.  They lost no time, and outside of Chicago several of these prime Flyers  joined by common impulse into a racing flock that went through air on  the same invisible track. A Homer may make a straight line when  following his general sense of direction, but when following a familiar  back track he sticks to the well-remembered landmarks. Most of the  birds had been trained by way of Columbus and Buffalo. Arnaux knew the  Columbus route, but also he knew that by Detroit, and after leaving  Lake Michigan, he took the straight line for Detroit. Thus he caught up  on his handicap and had the advantage of many miles. Detroit, Buffalo,  Rochester, with their familiar towers and chimneys, faded behind him,  and Syracuse was near at hand. It was now late afternoon; six hundred  miles in twelve hours he had flown and was undoubtedly leading the  race; but the usual thirst of the Flyer had attacked him. Skimming over  the city roofs, he saw a loft of Pigeons, and descending from his high  course in two or three great circles, he followed the ingoing Birds to  the loft and drank greedily at the water-trough, as he had often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#8)"],[1,"himself to be amused with their loud merriment, and their  evolutions in the water. They often renewed their visits, and rather  contributed to his safety, by assisting in the pursuit of white robbers:  and even when they inflicted dreadful outrages on many others, provoked  by extraordinary mal-treatment, they still preserved their kindness for  this amiable man, until they were finally removed to Flinders' Island.    These incidents were not uncommon:--the cross lights, which seem to  exhibit variously the character of a race, but in reality identify the  family of man. To judge of a people, during a season of extraordinary  excitement, must tend to erroneous conclusions: thus, when we turn to  contemporary writings, we are amazed at the ferocity of expression--the  sweeping and sanguinary appeals, by which they are disfigured; but this  astonishment is corrected, when we examine the incidents they record,  and recollect how little qualified men are to reason, when they are  doomed to suffer. So with the native: the delirium of rage, and the  taste for blood, had been produced by causes of long operation; and he  appeared to be a fiend full of mischief and spite, marked out by his  crimes for utter extinction.[12]    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 7: The ruffians who maltreated them were, indeed, punished  with 25 lashes!]    [Footnote 8: Whether from policy or humanity, Michael Howe formed an  exception.

This was  requisite, as the judge's address was utterly unintelligible.]    [Footnote 10: \"The natives are tenacious of their hunting grounds, as  the settlers are of their farms, and are displeased when they find  houses upon them.

The extent of their consumption, might be inferred from the increase  after their exit. To preserve their crops, some settlers were obliged to  employ hunters.

The violence of the natives seemed to require some extraordinary means  for its repression, and (in November, 1826) it was resolved to capture  the leaders, by the usual methods of arrest. The magistrates were  authorised, by the Governor, when danger was feared, to drive them to a  safe distance by force: to repress their attempts at disturbance, by  treating them as rioters; to seize those charged with felonies, whether  known by marks or by names, or by the denomination of their tribe; and  any person was authorised to raise the neighbourhood, on witnessing the  commission of a crime. This notice was renewed the following year, and  the military stationed in the interior, were instructed to render such  assistance as might be necessary, for its practical application.    But these measures were not attended with much success, and in April,  1828, the natives were forbidden to enter the settled districts of the  colony. They were permitted to pass through them, when on their passage  to the shore, provided their chiefs guaranteed their quietness, and  possessed a pass under the hand and seal of the Governor. A line, drawn  from Piper's River to St. Patrick's Head, separated the regions allotted  to them on that side; another, included Tasman's Peninsula; a third,  southward of Mount Wellington to the ocean; and the fourth, from the  Huon, by Western Bluff, south-west to the sea. Thus the proclamation cut  out the centre of the island: a square at the north-west,  belonged to the Van Diemen's Land Company, and others; southward, from  Ben Lomond, including most of the rivers, plains, and lagoons. Into  these, they were forbidden to intrude. There remained, the forests  of the south-west; the western coasts, where the skies for ever weep;  and the barren shores of the north-east. To drive them on these regions   was the duty of the forces, and their employment for years. The natives   returned regularly with the season, like birds of passage--avenging  the losses of their last retreat: they retired at the usual  time--diminished, but unsubdued.    In looking at these orders and proclamations, it is impossible to regard  them in any other light than as plans of military operation. That the  natives would surrender to a warrant or a challenge; that they would  remain in remote regions, from which they had always been accustomed to  come forth; that their chiefs had power to enforce the mandates of the  Governor, or that they would preserve an official document, they could  neither read nor understand--these were contingencies which, though  desirable, were certainly not probable. The precise and legal language  of the instruments, provoked much ridicule, and might justify a smile.  They were chiefly dictated by a gentleman, whose mental aberration led  to his removal from office. It is, however, difficult to suggest more  explicit forms, and the announcement of the plans of government was a  proper preliminary to their execution.    It was the desire of the Governor, earnestly expressed, to protect the  settlers, and yet to mitigate their resentment. The use of arms was  forbidden, while other means were untried, and rewards were offered to  any person who might venture into communication with the natives, to  explain the objects of the government. They were invited to seek redress  of their grievances; and pictures were suspended in the wood, in which  the white man was represented shooting the native, and the Governor  hanging the white.    These remedies were, however, ineffectual; and in November, 1828, the  settled districts were placed under the protection of martial law. Nine  parties, under Messrs. G. Robertson, Batman, and Jorgenson, consisting  of seven persons each, and assisted by the military when requisite, were  employed to enforce the proclamation. Mr. Anstey, the magistrate,  directed the operations in the centre of the island, and volunteers not  unfrequently joined in the repulsion or pursuit of this unhappy people.    The celebrated chief, Eumarrah, was captured by Mr. Gilbert Robertson,  in the Eastern Marshes, in 1828. This euphonius name, which so interests  the ear, it is said, was a corruption or improvement of the name of a  colonist, Hugh Murray, and adopted by the savage. A strong party,  consisting of military and constables, surrounded the hut, in which this  chief and others were sheltered. Five furious dogs rush towards Mr.  Robertson, the foremost of the party: having fired off his piece, and  seized a lad scrambling away, by him he was directed to a sheet of bark,  under which Eumarrah was concealed. While prostrate, a shot was fired at  him, which inflicted a flesh wound, and the musket of a soldier was  broken by beating him. Such is Robertson's indignant account of his  capture. With the chief, three others, Jack, Dolly, and Jemmy, were  taken: the portrait of the last has rather an innocent expression, and  has been honored with publication. This party, removed first to  Richmond, and then to Hobart Town, soon appeared reconciled to their  captivity: all, but Eumarrah. He was pensive and reserved, and, for a  time, resented his bondage. It is said, the outrages he had committed,  would have forfeited his life, had not his captor earnestly maintained  that he was a prisoner of war; and that to put him to death, would be to  equal his crimes.    The expeditions were attended with the same general incidents, and it  would be tedious to multiply examples. The number of prisoners was  lamentably disproportioned to the many that perished. To identify a  particular offender was impossible, nor was it of much importance, since  the natives now were animated by one spirit. The amazing agility with  which they moved; their magical powers of self concealment; their  destitution of dress, the greasing of their skin, and the vigilance of  their watch-dogs, rendered it nearly impossible to seize them in open  day.    An alarm would be given, that the blacks were approaching, and a party,  commissioned to repress them, would immediately advance; often  blundering and incautious, shouting, smoking, and straggling about;  carelessly firing their pieces, and affording abundant information of  their approach. Thus, after a fatiguing march, the natives, whom they  were sent out to meet, would be observed in their rear, having already  committed the premeditated depredation. Not that it was easy to elude  their observation, if they were conscious of pursuit, and it was nearly  impossible to overtake them.    Mr. Gilbert Robertson, after capturing Eumarrah, was twelve months"]]]
