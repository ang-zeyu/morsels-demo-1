His  official duties in connection with the maintainance of the Dutch  prisoners also became so heavy that the charges came to L1,000 a week.  The Savoy Hospital was filled with them, and a privy seal grant of  L20,000 was made to carry on the work; but the expenses increasing  reached L7,000 a week, and Evelyn had hard work to get money from the  treasury. Harassed with anxieties of this sort, he frequently went 'to  ye Royal Society to refreshe among ye philosophers' where he found  solace in serving along with Dryden, Waller, and others on a Committee  for the improvement of the English language.    In the following year the dreadful plague broke out, when he and one  other Commissioner were left to deal with the task of providing for the  sick and wounded prisoners. From 1,000 deaths in a week in the middle of  July, the mortality increased to near 10,000 by the beginning of  September, so he sent his wife and family to his brother at Wotton, and  remained at work, 'being resolved to stay at my house myselfe; and to  looke after my charge, trusting in the providence and goodnesse of God.'  Prisoners poured in in larger numbers than he could receive and guard in  fit places, and he was continually forced to importune for money lest  the prisoners should starve. It was then, perhaps, that Evelyn was  thrown most in contact with his intimate friend Pepys, for both of them  remained steadfast when others had fled. And they had their reward in  coming safely through their trial of faithfulness to official duty. 'Now  blessed be God,' he writes on 31 Dec. 1665, 'for his extraordinary  mercies and preservation of me this yeare, when thousands and ten  thousands perish'd and were swept away on each side of me.'    This hard work was a source of loss to Evelyn, as from time to time he  advanced monies of his own to supply provisions for the needy committed  to his care: and subsequent petitions for reinbursement were only  partially successful. But he was rewarded by the sunny warmth of that  royal favour which cost nothing, because when the King returned from  Oxford to Hampton Court and Evelyn went to wait upon his Majesty there  at the end of January, 1666, he duly records how 'he ran towards me, and  in a most gracious manner gave me his hand to kisse, with many thanks  for my care and faithfulnesse in his service in a time of such greate  danger, when every body fled their employments.' Poor Evelyn seems to  have been rather easily duped in this sort of way. 'Then the Duke (of  Albemarle) came towards me and embrac'd me with much kindnesse, telling  me if he had thought my danger would have been so greate, he would not  have suffer'd his Majesty to employ me in that station.' And so on,  'after which I got home, not being very well in health.' It certainly  was such ridiculously insincere treatment that it might well have caused  immediate sickening in one of robust health.    It was, forsooth, only in very minor matters that Evelyn profited by the  royal favour or by his courtiership. In April, 1666, Charles informed  him that he must now be sworn for a Justice of the Peace, ('the office  in the world I had most industriously avoided, in regard of the  perpetual trouble thereoff in these numerous parishes'), and he only  escaped this infliction by humbly desiring to be excused from fresh  duties inconsistent with the other service he was engaged in. So excused  he was, by royal favour, for which he 'rendered his Majesty many  thanks.' And on that same day he declined re-election to the Council of  the Royal Society for the following year on 'earnest suite' of other  affairs; for he had to be consistent in such different matters that  would have engaged a portion of his time.    Besides his work in connection with prisoners and the Mint he was  shortly afterwards nominated one of the Commissioners for regulating the  farming and making of saltpetre and gunpowder throughout Britain, an  appointment which was all the more appropriate from the fact that his  grandfather, George Evelyn of Long Ditton and Wotton (1530-1603), had  been the first to introduce the manufacture of gunpowder into England,  when he established mills on both of his properties. He was also  appointed one of the three Surveyors of the repairs of St. Paul's  Cathedral, 'and to consider of a model for the new building, or, if it  might be, repairing of the steeple, which was most decay'd.'    With hands and head fully occupied with business affairs he found time  for other work of a useful nature, while still having plenty of leisure  for social duties and enjoyments. In this respect he forms a good  example of the well-known truth that it is always the busiest men who  can spare most time for matters lying outside of their special grooves  of work. Thus in September, 1665, he drew up a scheme for erecting an  infirmary at Chatham, in which he was supported by his friend Pepys,  then a high official in the Navy Department and like himself a shrewd  man of business and method, and therefore finding time for other than  purely routine official work; while in August, 1666, he entreated the  Lord Chancellor 'to visite the Hospital of the Savoy, and reduce it  (after ye greate abuse that had been continu'd) to its original  institution for ye benefit of the poore, which he promis'd to do.'    But nothing came from either of these schemes, for on 2nd. Sept. 'this  fatal night about ten, began the deplorable fire neere Fish Streete in  London.' It raged by day and by night,--'(if I may call that night which  was light as day for 10 miles round about, after a dreadful manner).'  Nothing could be done to stay its progress, and the citizens were  awe-stricken and paralyzed by fear. 'The conflagration was so universal,  and the people so astonish'd, that from the beginning, I know not by  what despondency or fate, they hardly stirr'd to quench it, so that  there was nothing heard or seene but crying out and lamentation, running  about like distracted creatures without at all attempting to save even  their goods; such a strange consternation there was upon them, so as it  burned both in breadth and length, the churches, publics halls,  Exchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments, leaping after a  prodigious manner, from house to house and streete to streete, at great  distances one from ye other; for ye heate with a long set of faire and  warm weather had even ignited the aire and prepar'd the materials to  conceive the fire, which devour'd after an incredible manner houses,  furniture, and every thing. Here we saw the Thames cover'd with goods  floating, all the barges and boats laden with what some had time and  courage to save, as, on ye other, ye carts etc., carrying out to the  fields, which for many miles were strew'd with moveables of all sorts,  and tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get  away. Oh the miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as happly the  world had not seene since the foundation of it, nor be outdon till the  universal conflagration thereof. All the skie was of a fiery aspect,  like the top of a burning oven, and the light seene above 40 miles round  about for many nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like,  who now saw above 10,000 houses all in one flame; the noise and cracking  and thunder of the impetuous flames, ye shreiking of women and children,  the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses, and churches, was like  an hideous storme, and the aire all about so hot and inflam'd that at  the last one was not able to approach it, so that they were forc'd to  stand and let ye flames burn on, which they did for neere two miles in  lengh and one in breadh. The clowds also of smoke were dismall and  reach'd upon computation neer 50 miles in length. Thus I left it this  afternoone burning, a resemblance of Sodom, or the last day. It forcibly  call'd to my mind that passage--_non enim hic habemus stabilem  civitatem_: the ruines resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but  is no more! Thus I returned.'    For days the conflagration raged, although the whole situation might  probably have been saved if the advice of seamen, then as now amongst  the bravest and most practical of Britain's sons, had been followed.  When the court suburb of Whitehall began to be threatened,--'but oh, the  confusion there was then at the Court!'--the gentlemen, 'who hitherto  had stood as men intoxicated, with their hands acrosse,.... began to  consider that nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing up of so  many houses as might make a wider gap than any had yet been made by the  ordinary method of pulling them downe with engines; this some stout  seamen propros'd early enough to have sav'd neere ye whole citty, but  this some tenacious and avaritious men, aldermen, etc., would not  permitt, because their houses must have been of the first.' At length,  however, the fire died out, the houseless citizens finding refuge in  tents and miserable huts and hovels hastily erected about St. George's  fields and Moorfields as far as Highgate. But Evelyn's abode had  remained untouched. From reviewing the now poverty-striken people 'in  this calamitous condition I return'd with a sad heart to my house,  blessing and adoring the distinguishing mercy of God to me and mine, who  in the midst of all this ruine was like Lot, in my little Zoar, safe  and sound.'    The plague and the fire were held to be the visitation of God's anger,  and Evelyn evidently thought the heavy punishment richly merited. 'Oct.  10th. This day was order'd a generall fast thro' the Nation, to humble  us on ye late dreadfull conflagration, added to the plague and warr, the  most dismall judgments that could be inflicted, but whiche indeed we  highly deserv'd for our prodigious ingratitude, burning lusts, dissolute  Court, profane and abominable lives, under such dispensations of God's  continu'd favour in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#8)"],[1," suppliant. The  virgin made a sign to him to fear nothing. Her tranquil gaze said--    \"I follow you, Ulysses, and bow to necessity--because I wish to die.  Daughter of Priam, and sister of Hector, my couch, which was once worthy  of Kings, shall never receive a foreign master. Freely do I quit the  light of day.\"    Hecuba, lying motionless in the dust, suddenly rose and enfolded her  daughter in a last despairing embrace. Polyxena gently, but resolutely,  removed the old arms which held her. She seemed to say--    \"Do not expose yourself, mother, to the fury of your master. Do not wait  until he drags you ignominiously on the ground in tearing me from your  arms. Better, O well-beloved mother, to give me your wrinkled hand, and  bend your hollow cheeks to my lips.\"    The face of Thais looked beautiful in its grief. The crowd felt grateful  to her for showing them the forms and passions of life endowed with  superhuman grace, and Paphnutius pardoned her present splendour on  account of her coming humility, and glorified himself in advance for the  saint he was about to give to heaven.    The drama neared its end. Hecuba fell as though dead, and Polyxena, led  by Ulysses, advanced towards the tomb, which was surrounded by the  chief warriors. A dirge was sung as she mounted the funeral pile, on the  summit of which the son of Achilles poured out libations from a gold  cup to the manes of the hero. When the sacrificing priests stretched out  their arms to seize her, she made a sign that she wished to die free and  unbound, as befitted the daughter of so many kings. Then, tearing aside  her robe, she bared her bosom to the blow. Pyrrhus, turning away his  head, plunged his sword into her heart, and by a skilful trick, the  blood gushed forth over the dazzling white breast of the virgin, who,  with head thrown back, and her eyes swimming in the horrors of death,  fell with grace and modesty.    Whilst the warriors enshrouded the victim with a veil, and covered her  with lilies and anemones, terrified screams and groans rent the air, and  Paphnutius, rising from his seat, prophesied in a loud voice.    \"Gentiles? vile worshippers of demons! And you Arians more infamous than  the idolaters!--learn! That which you have just seen is an image and a  symbol. There is a mystic meaning in this fable, and very soon the woman  you see there will be offered, a willing and happy sacrifice, to the  risen God.\"    But already the crowd was surging in dark waves towards the exits. The  Abbot of Antinoe, escaping from the astonished Dorion, gained the door,  still prophesying.    An hour later he knocked at the door of the house of Thais.    The actress then lived in the rich Racotis quarter, near the tomb of  Alexander, in a house surrounded by shady gardens, in which a brook,  bordered with poplars, flowed amidst artificial rocks. An old black  slave woman, loaded with rings, opened the door, and asked what he  wanted.    \"I wish to see Thais,\" he replied. \"God is my witness that I came here  for no other purpose.\"    As he wore a rich tunic, and spoke in an imperious manner, the slave  allowed him to enter.    \"You will find Thais,\" she said, \"in the Grotto of Nymphs.\"          PART THE SECOND -- THE PAPYRUS    Thais was born of free, but poor, parents, who were idolaters. When she  was a very little girl, her father kept, at Alexandria, near the Gate  of the Moon, an inn, which was frequented by sailors. She still  retained some vivid, but disconnected, memories of her early youth. She  remembered her father, seated at the corner of the hearth with his legs  crossed--tall, formidable, and quiet, like one of those old Pharaohs who  are celebrated in the ballads sung by blind men at the street corners.  She remembered also her thin, wretched mother, wandering like a hungry  cat about the house, which she filled with the tones of her sharp  voice, and the glitter of her phosphorescent eyes. They said in the  neighbourhood that she was a witch, and changed into an owl at night,  and flew to see her lovers. It was a lie. Thais knew well, having often  watched her, that her mother practised no magic arts, but that she was  eaten up with avarice, and counted all night the gains of the day. The  idle father and the greedy mother let the child live as best it could,  like one of the fowls in the poultry-yard. She became very clever in  extracting, one by one, the oboli from the belt of some drunken sailor,  and in amusing the drinkers with artless songs and obscene words, the  meaning of which she did not know. She passed from knee to knee, in a  room reeking with the odours of fermented drinks and resiny wine-skins;  then, her cheeks sticky with beer and pricked by rough beards, she  escaped, clutching the oboli in her little hand, and ran to buy  honey-cakes from an old woman who crouched behind her baskets under the  Gate of the Moon. Every day the same scenes were repeated, the  sailors relating their perilous adventures, then playing at dice or  knuckle-bones, and blaspheming the gods, amid their shouting for the  best beer of Cilicia.    Every night the child was awakened by the quarrels of the drunkards.  Oyster-shells would fly across the tables, cutting the heads of those  they hit, and the uproar was terrible. Sometimes she saw, by the light  of the smoky lamps, the knives glitter, and the blood flow.    It humiliated her to think that the only person who showed her any human  kindness in her young days was the mild and gentle Ahmes. Ahmes, the  house-slave, a Nubian blacker than the pot he gravely skimmed, was as  good as a long night's sleep. Often he would take Thais on his knee,  and tell her old tales about underground treasure-houses constructed for  avaricious kings, who put to death the masons and architects. There  were also tales about clever thieves who married kings' daughters, and  courtesans who built pyramids. Little Thais loved Ahmes like a father,  like a mother, like a nurse, and like a dog. She followed the slave into  the cellar when he went to fill the amphorae, and into the poultry-yard  amongst the scraggy and ragged fowls, all beak, claws, and feathers, who  flew swifter than eagles before the knife of the black cook. Often at  night, on the straw, instead of sleeping, he built for Thais little  water-mills, and ships no bigger than his hand, with all their rigging.    He had been badly treated by his masters; one of his ears was torn,  and his body covered with scars. Yet his features always wore an air of  joyous peace. And no one ever asked him whence he drew the consolation  in his soul, and the peace in his heart. He was as simple as a child.  As he performed his heavy tasks, he sang, in a harsh voice, hymns which  made the child tremble and dream. He murmured, in a gravely joyous  tone--         \"Tell us, Mary, what thou hast seen where thou hast been?       I saw the shroud and the linen cloths, and the angels       seated on the tomb.       And I saw the glory of the Risen One.\"    She asked him--    \"Father, why do you sing about angels seated on a tomb?\"    And he replied--    \"Little light of my eyes, I sing of the angels because Jesus, our Lord,  is risen to heaven.\"    Ahmes was a Christian. He had been baptised, and was known as Theodore  at the meetings of the faithful, to which he went secretly during the  hours allowed him for sleep.    At that time the Church was suffering the severest trials. By order of  the Emperor, the churches had been thrown down, the holy books burned,  the sacred vessels and candlesticks melted. The Christians had been  deprived of all their honours, and expected nothing but death. Terror  reigned over all the community at Alexandria, and the prisons were  crammed with victims. It was whispered with horror amongst the faithful,  that in Syria, in Arabia, in Mesopotamia, in Cappadocia, in all the  empire, bishops and virgins had been flogged, tortured, crucified or  thrown to wild beasts. Then Anthony, already celebrated for his visions  and his solitary life, a prophet, and the head of all the Egyptian  believers, descended like an eagle from his desert rock on the city of  Alexandria, and, flying from church to church, fired the whole community  with his holy ardour. Invisible to the pagans, he was present at the  same time at all the meetings of Christians, endowing all with the  spirit of strength and prudence by which he was animated. Slaves, in  particular, were persecuted with singular severity. Many of them, seized  with fright, denied the faith. Others, and by far the greater number,  fled to the desert, hoping to live there, either as hermits or robbers.  Ahmes, however, frequented the meetings as usual, visited the prisoners,  buried the martyrs, and joyfully professed the religion of Christ. The  great Anthony, who saw his unshaken zeal, before he returned into the  desert, pressed the black slave in his arms, and gave him the kiss of  peace.    When Thais was seven years old, Ahmes began to talk to her of God.    \"The good Lord God,\" he said, \"lived in heaven like a Pharaoh, under  the tents of His harem, and under the trees of His gardens. He was the  Ancient of Ancients, and older than the world; and He had but one Son,  the Prince Jesus, whom He loved with all His heart, and who surpassed in  beauty the virgins and the angels. And the good Lord God said to Prince  Jesus--    \"'Leave My harem and My palace, and My date trees and My running  waters. Descend to earth for the welfare of men. There Thou shalt  be like a little child, and Thou shalt live poor amongst the poor.  Suffering shall be Thy daily bread, and Thou shalt weep so profusely  that Thy tears shall form rivers, in which the tired slave shall bathe  with delight. Go, My Son!'    \"Prince Jesus obeyed the good Lord, and He came down to earth, to a  place named Bethlehem of Judaea. And He walked in fields, amidst the  flowering anemones, saying to His companion--    \"'Blessed are"]]]
