When he rose, at a short distance from the shark, he was again  prepared for a rush on the part of his enemy; but the great fish  had now had enough of it. He was still striking the water, but his  movements were becoming slower, for he was weakened by the loss of  blood from the stabs he had received from below, and from the  arrows, many of which were now buried to the goose quill in him. In  a minute or two he gradually turned on one side, and floated, with  his white belly in the air.    A shout broke from the crew of the Swanne, and also of the Pacha,  who had been attracted to the side by the cries. When he saw that  the battle was over, and that the enemy had been vanquished without  loss of life, or hurt to any, Ned speedily seized one of the ropes,  and climbed up the side of the ship; where he was, you may be sure,  received with great cheering, and shouts of joy and approval.    \"You are a fine lad,\" Captain John Drake said, \"and your name of  Otter has indeed been well bestowed. You have saved the life of  your comrade; and I know that my old friend, Mr. Frank Tressilis,  his father, will feel indebted indeed to you, when he comes to  learn how gallantly you risked your life to preserve that of his  son.\"    Ned said that he saw no credit in the action, and that he was  mightily glad to have had an opportunity of learning to do that  which the negroes thought nothing of; for that it shamed him to  think that these heathens would venture their lives boldly against  sharks, while he, an English boy, although a good swimmer, and not,  he hoped, wanting in courage, was yet afraid to encounter these  fierce brutes.    This incident acted, as might be expected, as a fresh bond between  the boys; and as it also secured for Ned the cordial goodwill of  the sailors, they were, in future, free from any persecution at the  hands of Master Taunton, or of his fellows.          Chapter 4: An Unsuccessful Attack.        It should have been said, in its proper place, that upon the day  after the arrival of the Pacha and Swanne in Pheasant Bay, a barque  named the Isle of Wight, commanded by James Rause, with thirty men  on board, many of whom had sailed with Captain Drake upon his  previous voyages, came into the port; and there was great greeting  between the crews of the various ships. Captain Rause brought with  him a Spanish caravel, captured the day before; and a shallop also,  which he had taken at Cape Blanco. This was a welcome reinforcement,  for the crews of the two ships were but small for the purpose which  they had in hand, especially as it would be necessary to leave a  party to take charge of the vessels. Captain Drake made some proposals  to Captain Rause, which the latter accepted, and it was arranged that  he and his crew would be, for a time, under the command of Captain Drake.    When the division of the crews was made, it was decided that James  Rause should remain in command of the four ships at Pheasant Bay;  and that Captain Drake, with fifty-three of his own men and twenty  of Rause's, should start in the three pinnaces and the shallop for  Nombre de Dios.    The first point at which they stopped was the Isle of Pines, on the  22nd July. Here they put in to water the boats and, as the crews  had been cramped from their stay therein, Captain Drake decided to  give them a day on shore. Ned and Reuben Gale were of the party,  the other two being, to their great discontent, left behind in the  ship.    After the barriques had been filled with water, the fires lit for  cooking, and the labors of the day over, Ned and Reuben started for  a ramble in the island, which was of a goodly extent. When they had  proceeded some distance in the wood, picking fruit as they went,  and looking at the butterflies and bright birds, they were suddenly  seized and thrown upon the ground by some men, who sprang out from  the underwood through which they had passed. They were too  surprised at this sudden attack to utter even a cry; and, being  safely gagged and bound, they were lifted by their captors, and  carried away into the interior of the island.    After an hour's passage they were put down in the heart of a thick  grove of trees and, looking round, saw they were surrounded by a  large number of natives. One of these, a person evidently in  authority, spoke to them in a language which they did not  understand. They shook their heads, and after several times  attempting to make them comprehend, Ned caught the words Espanolos.    To this he vehemently shook his head in denial, which caused quite  an excitement among his hearers. One of the latter then said  \"English,\" to which Ned and his companion nodded.    The news evidently filled the natives with great joy. The bands  were taken off the boys, and the Indians endeavored, by gestures,  to express the sorrow that they felt for having carried them off.  It was clear that they had taken them for Spaniards, and that they  had been watched as they wandered inland, and captured for the  purpose of learning the objects and force of the expedition. Now,  however, that their captors understood that the ships were English,  with great signs of pleasure they started with them for the  seashore.    It had already darkened when they arrived there, and the crews of  the boats jumped hastily to their feet, at the sight of so many  persons approaching. Ned, however, called to them just as they were  about to betake themselves to their arms, and shouted that the  natives were perfectly friendly, and well disposed. Captain Drake  himself now advanced, and entered into conversation with the leader  of the natives, in Spanish. It seemed that they had met before, and  that many, indeed, of the natives were acquainted with his person.  These were a party of Simeroons, as they were then called; i.e.,  of natives who had been made slaves by the Spaniards, and who had  now fled. They afterwards came to be called Cameroons, and are  mostly so spoken of in the books of English buccaneers. These men  were greatly pleased at the arrival of Captain Drake and his boats,  for their own had been destroyed, and they feared taking to the sea  in such as they could build.    After much talk, Captain Drake arranged to put them on shore, so  that they would go on to the Isthmus of Darien, where there were  more of them in the forests; and they promised to prepare these to  assist Captain Drake, when he should come there. The natives, some  thirty in number, were soon packed in the boats, and were ready to  cross to the mainland; and the party then going forward, entered  the port of Nombre de Dios at three in the morning.    As they sailed in, being yet a good way from the city, they came  upon a barque of some 60 tons. It was all unprepared for attack,  and the boats got alongside, and the crews climbed on to the deck  before their presence was discovered, or dreamt of. No resistance  whatever was offered by the Spaniards against the English. All  were, indeed, asleep below.    A search was made, and it was found that the ship was laden with  Canary wine, a circumstance which gave great pleasure to the  English, who looked forward to a long bout of good drinking. While  they were searching the ship, they had paid but little attention to  the Spanish crew. Presently, however, they heard the sound of oars  at some little distance from the ship.    \"What is that?\" said Captain Drake.    Ned ran to the stern of the vessel.    \"I think, sir,\" he said, \"that one or two of the Spaniards have got  off, with their boat. I saw it towing to the stern, when we  boarded.\"    Captain Drake leant over the side, and at once gave orders to one  of the boats whose crew had not boarded the vessel, and was lying  alongside, to pursue; and to strain every nerve to catch the boat,  before she came near the town. The sailors leapt to the oars, and  pulled with a will, for they knew as well as their captain how  serious a matter it would be, were the town alarmed; and indeed,  that all their toil and pains would be thrown away, as it was only  by surprise that so small a handful of men could possibly expect to  take a large and important town like Nombre de Dios.    Fortunately the boat overtook the fugitives before they were within  hailing distance of the town, and rapidly towed them back to the  ship. All then took their places in the pinnaces, and pushed off  without further delay. It was not yet light, and steered by one who  knew the town well, they rowed up alongside a battery, which  defended it, without the alarm being given. As they climbed up over  the wall the sentry fired his piece, and the artillerymen, who,  there having been some rumors of the arrival of Drake's fleet in  those waters, were sleeping by the side of their guns, sprang to  their feet and fled, as the English leapt down into the battery.  There were six large guns in the place, and many small, and  bombards.    \"Now, my lads,\" Captain Drake said, \"you must lose no time. In five  minutes, yonder artillerymen will have alarmed the whole town, and  we must be there before the Spaniards have managed to get their  sleepy eyes open.    \"Advance in three parties, and meet in the marketplace. It is good  that we should make as much show as possible. There can be no more  concealment and, therefore, we must endeavor to make the Spaniards  believe that we are a far stronger force than, in truth, we are.\"    It was not until the three parties met in the marketplace that any  real resistance on the part of the Spaniards began, although  windows had been opened, and shots fired here and there. The alarm  bells were now ringing, shouts and screams were heard through the  town, and the whole population was becoming fairly aroused. As they  entered the marketplace, however, a heavy fire "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#8)"],[1,"carpets have to be swept, washed, and beaten at  least once a week.    Now when the King, the Chancellor, and the Chamberlain failed to return,  the people took the hunter out of his prison and made him king, because  he was the richest and most powerful of them all.    As for the treasure of the treasure castle, it is still there, packed in  the linen sacks, lying just inside the great door.    Perhaps some day you may find it. If you do, don't be greedy, and don't  go up to the turret chamber.             PRINCE SNEEZE    [Illustration: In a cave filled with icicles, a small dog and a giant  are looking into an open chest.]      Once upon a time a king and a queen gave a magnificent party in honor of  the christening of their new-born son, Prince Rolandor. To this party  the royal parents took good care to invite every single fairy in  Fairyland, for they knew very well the unhappy consequences of  forgetting to invite fairies to christenings. When all the invitations  had been sent out, the Queen went down to the kitchen to superintend the  cooking of the master-dainty of the feast, a huge strawberry-tart.    The morning on which the grand ceremony was to take place arrived. At  half-past ten the Court Astrologer, who was master of ceremonies, gave  the order to form in line; and at ten minutes to eleven the splendid  procession started for the church. The road was lined with the King's  vassals shouting, \"Hurrah, hurrah!\" Countless little elves with gauzy  wings watched from the branches of the trees; and the great cathedral  bells went clang, bang, clang, as merrily as could be.    Just behind the royal body-guard came the King's gold-and-diamond coach  shining in the sunlight of June, with the King and the Queen in it on  one side and the Court Astrologer and the fairy Titania, prospective  godparents of the little Prince, on the other. The Prince himself,  swathed in a wonderful silk mantle edged with pearls and turquoises,  slept in the Astrologer's arms.    The procession entered the church, where the venerable Lord Archbishop,  surrounded by a magnificent choir, was awaiting its coming. A hush went  over the great assembly as the parents and the godparents advanced to  the flower-decked font, and the silence lasted until His Eminence had  sprinkled the Prince and given him the name of Rolandor. Then the bells  rang again, the organ roared so that the windows shook in their  casements, and the choristers sang like birds on a summer afternoon.    The christening over, the procession went back to the castle, past the  waiting rows of bystanders, not one of whom had changed his place or  gone away, so superb had been the spectacle.    The christening banquet was laid in the great hall of the castle, and,  thanks to the Court Astrologer, things went off beautifully. It was the  only large banquet ever known in the history of the world where courses  were served all at one time, and while one person was finishing an ice,  another was not beginning with the soup. Nor was the menu mixed, which  happens so frequently to-day that you are apt to have soup, ice, cake,  roast, soup, and a roast again. No, from soup to ice the banquet was a  huge success; but, alas, disaster came with the strawberry-tart.    As the Queen was chatting with the Lord Chancellor of the Enchanted  Islands, she happened to notice--for like a good hostess she had been  keeping an eye to the comfort of her guests--that nobody on the  right-hand side of the hall had been served with strawberry-tart. Almost  at the same moment, the chief cook, looking rather pale and worried,  bustled through the throng and whispered in her ear, \"Your Majesty, the  strawberry-tart has given out!\"    The Queen turned pale. At length she managed to ask in a weak voice,  \"Have you plenty of other pastries?\"    \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" replied the cook.    \"Then let them be served at once.\"    The cook withdrew, and the Queen, though somewhat shaken, took up the  conversation again. Ten minutes passed, and she was beginning to forget  her start, when a voice, rising clear and rasping over the hubbub of the  hall, said suddenly, \"Where's my piece of strawberry-tart?\"    Everybody turned toward the speaker, an elderly fairy from the Kingdom  of the Black Mountains, named Malvolia. She stood up in her place, her  arms akimbo, glowering at her plate, on which an attendant had just  deposited a small chocolate eclair.    \"Where's my piece of strawberry-tart?\" she repeated.    The Queen rose. \"I am very sorry, Madam Malvolia,\" said she in her  sweetest voice, \"but the strawberry-tart has given out.\"    \"Hoity-toity,\" answered Malvolia rudely; \"you mean that you only baked  enough for your own personal friends.\"    At this several guests cried, \"Sh! Sh!\" and the King began to look  worried.    \"We will send for some at once,\" announced His Majesty.    \"Oh yes,--strawberry-tart baked by the Queen's own hands for her own  dear friends,\" said Malvolia sneeringly; \"but for me, a fairy of age and  distinction, an ordinary, low baker's eclair. The Kingdom of the Black  Mountains has been deliberately insulted in my person!\"    \"No, no, no, no!\" cried the King and the Queen. \"We assure you, madam,  that it was a simple mischance.\"    \"Pish and tush!\" replied Malvolia, who, like a great many people,  secretly enjoyed feeling herself aggrieved. \"I consider the affair an  affront, a deliberate affront. And you shall pay dear for this  humiliation,\" she screamed, quickly losing control of her temper. \"Every  time the Prince sneezes something shall change until--\"    At this very moment, alas, a northeast wind blew gustily through the  open windows of the hall, shaking the tapestries from the walls, and  carrying away the last of Malvolia's sentence. The angry fairy turned  herself into a great black raven and flew, cawing hoarsely, over the  heads of the banqueters and out of the window with the wind.    A baby's cry was heard, and the King and the Queen rushed panic-stricken  to where their little son lay in his cradle on a raised platform at the  head of the hall. The little Prince's fat, pink face was twisted into  dreadful lines; he opened his mouth wide several times and half closed  it again; then, opening it wider than ever, he sneezed a terrible  sneeze.    There came a loud clap of thunder. When the confusion was over, the  Court Astrologer was found to have turned into an eight-day clock, with  a sun, moon, and stars arrangement, a planetary indicator, and a  calendar calculated for two thousand years. The banquet ended rather  gloomily, although the gifts of the other fairies, such as health,  wealth, and beauty, managed to make everyone a little more cheerful.    When the guests were gone, the King and Queen sent for Doctor Pill, the  court physician, to consult him in regard to the measures which ought to  be taken to prevent the Prince's sneezing. As for the poor Court  Astrologer, he was hung up in the sacristy of the cathedral, and every  eight days his wife wound him up, with tears.    \"What shall we do, doctor?\" asked the King rather mournfully.    \"The Prince must be preserved from the things which cause sneezing,\"  said the doctor sagely.    \"Such as draughts?\" suggested the King.    \"Draughts, head-colds, snuff, and pepper,\" answered the leech. \"Let his  little highness be put into a special suite of rooms; admit no person to  them until he has been examined for head-cold, and has put on germ-proof  garments; and as his little highness grows older, forbid the use of  pepper in his food. Better still, if Your Majesty has a castle in the  mountains, let the Prince be taken there for the sake of the purer air.\"    \"There is the tower on the Golden Mountain,\" said the King.    At this the Queen began to weep again, for she, quite naturally, did not  wish to part with her child.    \"But, my dear, we can't have him sneezing, and things changing all the  time,\" said the King.    \"I beg Your Majesty to consider the danger of a head-cold,\" put in the  doctor.    \"Yes, think of the danger of a head-cold,\" echoed the King, who saw  clearer than the Queen the chaos that might result if the Prince was  attacked by a prolonged fit of sneezing. \"People with head-colds may  sneeze ten or fifteen times a day.\"    \"Or fifty,\" said the doctor.    \"Or fifty,\" echoed the King again, shaking his head, for he was torn  between paternal love and kingly duty. \"Imagine fifty enchantments in a  day! By eventide the whole kingdom would be upset, undone, and the  people plotting a revolution.\"    \"The tower on the Golden Mountain is in a fine healthful locality,\" said  the doctor, \"and the Prince could be brought up as happily there as in  the palace.\"    So at length the Queen consented. In a few days the little Prince, who  had not sneezed a second time, was removed to the tower on the Golden  Mountain. His room, designed by Doctor Pill, was completely protected  from draughts, and every breath of air that entered it was  tri-bi-sterilized. Mrs. Pill, who had been a hospital nurse, took care  of him. Three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, his  royal parents rode out to the tower, and after putting on germ-proof  garments, were admitted to the nursery of their infant son.    And so the years went by. Nobody was found able to break Malvolia's  spell, and the clue to its undoing had been carried away by the wind.  Malvolia herself had disappeared.    The Prince became a handsome little boy. Accomplished teachers taught  him history, music, drawing, dancing, and all the other things that a  prince ought to know. But of real life he knew almost nothing at all.    His most faithful friend during these lonely years was a French poodle,  who spoke both French and English exceedingly well. Of course, he had a  marked canine accent, rather growling his g's and howling the aw's and  the ow's, but his words were well chosen and his vocabulary extensive.  Never was seen a more"]]]
