Similar  signs appear on the body of the serpent in many places, as in  Tro-Cortesianus 30a (Pl. 11, fig. 1).    We have already noted that the serpent, god B, and water are frequently  shown together, so the serpent also appears associated with water and  rain, when no figure of god B is present. From this connection, it can  be argued that there is some relation between the serpent and the coming  of the rains. These facts would give strength to the theory that god B  is to be identified as a rain god. In Dresden 33a, 35a, god B is seated  on the open jaws of a serpent, while the body of the reptile encloses a  blue field evidently signifying water. The number nineteen appears on  this blue color. It will be noted that there are nineteen spots on the  serpents in Pl. 11, figs. 1, 2. In Tro-Cortesianus 3a-6a, corresponding  scenes seem to be shown. The body of the serpent encloses water, and  here the number eighteen appears in each case. God B occurs always in  front of the serpent and his head appears as the head of the reptile in  the first instance. In Dresden 35a, 36a, the head of god B is pictured  as the head of the serpent in the midst of the water. In Dresden 37b  (Pl. 10, fig. 8), B is holding a snake in the water.    Water appears in connection with the serpent and god B in many places in  the Tro-Cortesianus. In 9, god B is pictured pouring water from a jar, a  common method of showing the idea of rain in the codices. In 12b, B  again is shown perhaps representing a frog, and behind him a serpent.  The reptiles in 13b-18b, are all associated with the idea of rain, the  turtle and frog also appearing in this section. In 30a (Pl. 11, fig. 1),  god B and a female figure are both pouring water from a jar, as they  stand on the body of a serpent. In 32a, the black god (L) is seen in the  rain, and a serpent is near, while in 32b and 33b (Pl. 9, fig. 1), the  serpent forms the belt of god L, and a female figure and water are seen  in both cases. The blue color of the snake and of god B in 31b (Pl. 11,  fig. 2) may also suggest water.    God B also occurs in connection with the serpent in Dresden 42a (Pl. 8,  fig. 14), where the god is seated on the reptile, in Tro-Cortesianus,  10b, where the head of the same god is the head of the snake, and in  Tro-Cortesianus 19a, where god B again and god A are each seated on the  open jaws of a serpent.    The astronomical role of the serpent is noted in Dresden 56b, 57b (Pl.  10, fig. 3), Tro-Cortesianus 5b, 12b, 15b, and 67b, where the snake is  shown in connection with a line of constellation signs, the _kin_ or sun  sign prominent in most of the drawings. In the \"battle of the  constellations\" in Dresden 60, the serpent appears forming a sort of  altar, the seat of a figure which is supported by another figure. A  serpent head also appears at the foot of the latter figure.    That the serpent appears associated with the idea of time seems clear  from the fact of the long number series in Dresden 61, 62 (Pl. 10, fig.  7), and 69, which are shown in the spaces made by the winding of the  serpents' bodies. In Tro-Cortesianus 13a-16a, four large reptiles appear  in connection with the lines of day signs.    The study of the serpent used as a head-dress is interesting. As noted  previously, quite a different kind of snake seems to be represented when  used in this connection. Two other points come out in this  investigation, namely, that it is only with female figures that the  serpent is employed as a head-dress, and in far the greater number of  cases the women are shown, either in the act of offering something, or  of pouring water from a jar. The usual type of serpent head-dress is  seen in Dresden 9c (Pl. 8, fig. 11), 15b (Pl. 8, fig. 12), 18a (Pl. 8,  fig. 13), 22b (Pl. 8, fig. 10), and 23b (Pl. 8, fig. 8). In the first  case, the offering is a jicara or gourd of some sacred drink  (_balt[vs]e_?), in the second and third examples, the dish is clearly  shown, but the offering is unidentifiable, in the fourth case, maize (a  _Kan_ sign), and in the last, a fish resting on a dish. In Dresden 20a  (Pl. 8, fig. 15), a woman with serpent head-dress is seen associated  with the Moan-headed figure, possibly in the act of offering it as a  sacrifice.    In Dresden 39b (Pl. 8, fig. 7), 43b (Pl. 8, fig. 9), and 70, a similar  serpent head-dress is shown on a female figure in the act of pouring  water from a jar. In Tro-Cortesianus, the serpent head-dresses differ in  type only, and in two out of the four cases where they appear, water is  shown flowing from the breasts (30b) of the female figure or from the  mouth (32b). The woman thus represented in connection with the water is  god I, the water goddess of Schellhas. She is, as he notes (1904, p. 31)  usually the figure of an old woman. \"Evidently, we have here the  personification of water in its quality of destroyer, a goddess of  floods and cloud-bursts.\" We are not at all sure that we have here a  distinct god as similar female figures with serpent head-dresses occur  frequently in the Dresden Codex with no suggestion of water. The failure  to find any distinct glyph for this goddess seems to strengthen the view  of not considering her as a separate deity. Finally, in our  consideration of head-dresses, the serpent is to be seen in  Tro-Cortesianus 79c on the head of the first woman who is weaving.  Possibly, a conventionalized serpent forms the head covering of the  second figure who is represented as dead.    The serpent in Dresden 26c-28c (Pl. 10, fig. 1) coiled around the altar  which rises from a _Tun_ sign is not easily explained. In 25c, the altar  is replaced by god B and in the former cases, the reptiles may stand for  this god with whom they are often associated.[316-*] The serpent seems  closely connected with the idea of offerings as the body of a snake is  shown in several instances as the support of the jar containing the  various gifts in Tro-Cortesianus 34a, 34b, 35a, 35b, 36a, 36b, and  possibly 52c (Pl. 9, fig. 3).    Finally the serpent is to be noted in a number of miscellaneous  connections:--in Dresden 36b (Pl. 19, fig. 11), as being attacked by a  black vulture,[317-*] in Tro-Cortesianus 40b (Pl. 9, fig. 4) a  rattlesnake is biting the foot of one of the hunters, and in  Tro-Cortesianus 66b, where the serpent has a human head and arm coming  from its open jaws. This is a very frequent method of representing the  serpent in the Maya stone carvings. In Tro-Cortesianus 60c, 100d (Pl. 9,  fig. 8), twice, 106a, and 111b, the rattlesnake is shown as a sprinkler  for the holy water in the hand (in the first, second and fourth  examples) of god D. Landa (1864, p. 150)[317-[+]] describes in the  ceremony of the baptism of children, that the leader of the rite wore on  his head a kind of mitre embroidered with plumage in some manner and in  his hand a small holy-water sprinkler of wood, carved skillfully, of  which the filaments were the tails of serpents, similar to serpents with  rattles.    In spite of the importance of the serpent in the manuscripts and stone  carvings, it never seems to appear as a separate deity. With one  exception, no glyph is to be found representing this reptile as is the  case with many of the animals. Tro-Cortesianus 106c (Pl. 9, fig. 7) is  this exception showing the rattles of a snake which are found in the  line of glyphs above two of the bees. No serpent appears in the picture.    The Nahuatl day, _Couatl_, has the signification serpent, as suggested  before, in discussing the meaning of the name _Quetzalcoatl_ or  _Quetzalcouatl_. This day sign occurs throughout the Mexican  manuscripts as the head of a serpent (Pl. 8, figs. 4, 6; Pl. 9, fig. 2;  Pl. 10, figs. 2, 4-6).    IGUANA. Of the lizards represented, the iguana (Maya _hu_) is the most  striking, and is readily identified on account of the prominent spines  along the back. As noted by Stempell, there are two or three species of  large lizards in Central America commonly called iguana, and it is  probable that the one here considered is the _Ctenosaura acanthura_ of  Yucatan or _Iguana tuberculata_ of South and Central America.    In the manuscripts the iguana is almost exclusively represented as an  offering (Pl. 12, figs. 1-6). It is usually found on top of the _Kan_  sign, meaning maize or bread,[318-*] and this, in turn, resting in a  bowl (Pl. 12, figs. 3, 4, 6). Landa (1864, p. 230)[318-[+]] gives a  pleasing confirmation of this offering of an iguana with bread. It is  possible that the object shown in Tro-Cortesianus 12b (Pl. 12, fig. 13)  may be the conventionalized representation of this lizard. It must be  admitted that this interpretation is very doubtful. The triangular  points suggest the lizard, but the pointed character of the sign as a  whole in no way resembles the back of this reptile. It is found  associated with three _Kan_ signs. In Cakchiquel, a dialect of the Maya  stock, _K'an_, according to Guzman and Brinton (1893, p. 24) is the name  applied to the female of the iguana or the lizard, and this is believed  to be the original sense of the Maya term. It may also be noted that the  Nahua day sign _Cuetzpalin_, meaning lizard, is the one which  corresponds with the Maya day _Kan_. Pl. 12, figs. 10, 12, 14, show  representations of the day corresponding to _Cuetzpalin_ in the Aubin  and Nuttall codices. These show a stout spineless species with a short  thick tail and may be the Gila monster (_Heloderma horridum_), a large  and somewhat poisonous species having much these proportions.    Further offerings are shown in Pl. 12, figs. 7, 8. These seem to be the  heads and forefeet of lizards, but, from the shape of the head, perhaps  not of iguanas.    In Stela D of Copan, the _Uinal_ period glyph seems to be represented by  a spineless lizard covered with scales (Pl. 12, fig. 9). Frog-like  characteristics also appear. This stone monument is remarkable from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#8)"],[1," the eastern side into a small lake.  I passed  along the western side of the lake, where the ground was easier, and when  I had got about half way I expected that I should see the plains which I  had already seen from the opposite mountains; but it was not to be so,  for the clouds rolled up to the very summit of the pass, though they did  not overlip it on to the side from which I had come.  I therefore soon  found myself enshrouded by a cold thin vapour, which prevented my seeing  more than a very few yards in front of me.  Then I came upon a large  patch of old snow, in which I could distinctly trace the half-melted  tracks of goats--and in one place, as it seemed to me, there had been a  dog following them.  Had I lighted upon a land of shepherds?  The ground,  where not covered with snow, was so poor and stony, and there was so  little herbage, that I could see no sign of a path or regular  sheep-track.  But I could not help feeling rather uneasy as I wondered  what sort of a reception I might meet with if I were to come suddenly  upon inhabitants.  I was thinking of this, and proceeding cautiously  through the mist, when I began to fancy that I saw some objects darker  than the cloud looming in front of me.  A few steps brought me nearer,  and a shudder of unutterable horror ran through me when I saw a circle of  gigantic forms, many times higher than myself, upstanding grim and grey  through the veil of cloud before me.    I suppose I must have fainted, for I found myself some time afterwards  sitting upon the ground, sick and deadly cold.  There were the figures,  quite still and silent, seen vaguely through the thick gloom, but in  human shape indisputably.    A sudden thought occurred to me, which would have doubtless struck me at  once had I not been prepossessed with forebodings at the time that I  first saw the figures, and had not the cloud concealed them from me--I  mean that they were not living beings, but statues.  I determined that I  would count fifty slowly, and was sure that the objects were not alive if  during that time I could detect no sign of motion.    How thankful was I when I came to the end of my fifty and there had been  no movement!    I counted a second time--but again all was still.    I then advanced timidly forward, and in another moment I saw that my  surmise was correct.  I had come upon a sort of Stonehenge of rude and  barbaric figures, seated as Chowbok had sat when I questioned him in the  wool-shed, and with the same superhumanly malevolent expression upon  their faces.  They had been all seated, but two had fallen.  They were  barbarous--neither Egyptian, nor Assyrian, nor Japanese--different from  any of these, and yet akin to all.  They were six or seven times larger  than life, of great antiquity, worn and lichen grown.  They were ten in  number.  There was snow upon their heads and wherever snow could lodge.  Each statue had been built of four or five enormous blocks, but how these  had been raised and put together is known to those alone who raised them.  Each was terrible after a different kind.  One was raging furiously, as  in pain and great despair; another was lean and cadaverous with famine;  another cruel and idiotic, but with the silliest simper that can be  conceived--this one had fallen, and looked exquisitely ludicrous in his  fall--the mouths of all were more or less open, and as I looked at them  from behind, I saw that their heads had been hollowed.    I was sick and shivering with cold.  Solitude had unmanned me already,  and I was utterly unfit to have come upon such an assembly of fiends in  such a dreadful wilderness and without preparation.  I would have given  everything I had in the world to have been back at my master's station;  but that was not to be thought of: my head was failing, and I felt sure  that I could never get back alive.    Then came a gust of howling wind, accompanied with a moan from one of the  statues above me.  I clasped my hands in fear.  I felt like a rat caught  in a trap, as though I would have turned and bitten at whatever thing was  nearest me.  The wildness of the wind increased, the moans grew shriller,  coming from several statues, and swelling into a chorus.  I almost  immediately knew what it was, but the sound was so unearthly that this  was but little consolation.  The inhuman beings into whose hearts the  Evil One had put it to conceive these statues, had made their heads into  a sort of organ-pipe, so that their mouths should catch the wind and  sound with its blowing.  It was horrible.  However brave a man might be,  he could never stand such a concert, from such lips, and in such a place.  I heaped every invective upon them that my tongue could utter as I rushed  away from them into the mist, and even after I had lost sight of them,  and turning my head round could see nothing but the storm-wraiths driving  behind me, I heard their ghostly chanting, and felt as though one of them  would rush after me and grip me in his hand and throttle me.    I may say here that, since my return to England, I heard a friend playing  some chords upon the organ which put me very forcibly in mind of the  Erewhonian statues (for Erewhon is the name of the country upon which I  was now entering).  They rose most vividly to my recollection the moment  my friend began.  They are as follows, and are by the greatest of all  musicians:--{2}    [Music score which cannot be reproduced]          CHAPTER VI: INTO EREWHON      And now I found myself on a narrow path which followed a small  watercourse.  I was too glad to have an easy track for my flight, to lay  hold of the full significance of its existence.  The thought, however,  soon presented itself to me that I must be in an inhabited country, but  one which was yet unknown.  What, then, was to be my fate at the hands of  its inhabitants?  Should I be taken and offered up as a burnt-offering to  those hideous guardians of the pass?  It might be so.  I shuddered at the  thought, yet the horrors of solitude had now fairly possessed me; and so  dazed was I, and chilled, and woebegone, that I could lay hold of no idea  firmly amid the crowd of fancies that kept wandering in upon my brain.    I hurried onward--down, down, down.  More streams came in; then there was  a bridge, a few pine logs thrown over the water; but they gave me  comfort, for savages do not make bridges.  Then I had a treat such as I  can never convey on paper--a moment, perhaps, the most striking and  unexpected in my whole life--the one I think that, with some three or  four exceptions, I would most gladly have again, were I able to recall  it.  I got below the level of the clouds, into a burst of brilliant  evening sunshine, I was facing the north-west, and the sun was full upon  me.  Oh, how its light cheered me!  But what I saw!  It was such an  expanse as was revealed to Moses when he stood upon the summit of Mount  Sinai, and beheld that promised land which it was not to be his to enter.  The beautiful sunset sky was crimson and gold; blue, silver, and purple;  exquisite and tranquillising; fading away therein were plains, on which I  could see many a town and city, with buildings that had lofty steeples  and rounded domes.  Nearer beneath me lay ridge behind ridge, outline  behind outline, sunlight behind shadow, and shadow behind sunlight, gully  and serrated ravine.  I saw large pine forests, and the glitter of a  noble river winding its way upon the plains; also many villages and  hamlets, some of them quite near at hand; and it was on these that I  pondered most.  I sank upon the ground at the foot of a large tree and  thought what I had best do; but I could not collect myself.  I was quite  tired out; and presently, feeling warmed by the sun, and quieted, I fell  off into a profound sleep.    I was awoke by the sound of tinkling bells, and looking up, I saw four or  five goats feeding near me.  As soon as I moved, the creatures turned  their heads towards me with an expression of infinite wonder.  They did  not run away, but stood stock still, and looked at me from every side, as  I at them.  Then came the sound of chattering and laughter, and there  approached two lovely girls, of about seventeen or eighteen years old,  dressed each in a sort of linen gaberdine, with a girdle round the waist.  They saw me.  I sat quite still and looked at them, dazzled with their  extreme beauty.  For a moment they looked at me and at each other in  great amazement; then they gave a little frightened cry and ran off as  hard as they could.    \"So that's that,\" said I to myself, as I watched them scampering.  I knew  that I had better stay where I was and meet my fate, whatever it was to  be, and even if there were a better course, I had no strength left to  take it.  I must come into contact with the inhabitants sooner or later,  and it might as well be sooner.  Better not to seem afraid of them, as I  should do by running away and being caught with a hue and cry to-morrow  or next day.  So I remained quite still and waited.  In about an hour I  heard distant voices talking excitedly, and in a few minutes I saw the  two girls bringing up a party of six or seven men, well armed with bows  and arrows and pikes.  There was nothing for it, so I remained sitting  quite still, even after they had seen me, until they came close up.  Then  we all had a good look at one another.    Both the girls and the men were very dark in colour, but not more so than  the South Italians or Spaniards.  The men wore no trousers, but were  dressed nearly the same as the Arabs whom I have seen in Algeria.  They  were of the most magnificent presence, being no less strong and handsome  than the women were beautiful; and not only this, but their expression  was courteous and benign.  I think they would have killed me at once if I  had made the slightest show of violence; but they gave me no impression  of their being likely to hurt me so"]]]
