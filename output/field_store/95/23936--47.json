Dacier then read the proposals for the three medals for the       three American general officers; after they had been thoroughly       discussed, Messrs.

And in the medal       of Gates, on the side of the head, instead of _Duci provido_ to       substitute _Duci strenuo_.                                              Friday, November 25, 1785.

The discussion was laid over, according to custom, until next       week.

Mardi 10 fevrier 1789.           -       -       -       -       -         Monsieur Dacier a mis, au commencement de la seance, sous les       yeux de l'Academie, le travail de Messieurs les commissaires       relativement aux medailles qu'ils etaient charges de rediger.         Sur la demande de Monsieur Jefferson, ministre des Etats-Unis de       l'Amerique, on a corrige ainsi l'exergue de la medaille       anciennement composee pour le general Morgan:         FUGATIS CAPTIS AUT CAESIS AD COWPENS HOSTIBUS, 17 JAN. 1781.           _Medaille pour le general Wayne._         _Type_: L'Amerique, reconnaissable a son ecusson, tient de la       main gauche, elevee, une couronne murale, et donne, de la droite,       une couronne de lauriers au general incline devant elle.         _Legende_: N.

Dacier then announced that Mr. Jefferson, Minister of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21894"],[0,"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall; or, The Struggles of the Young Cadets (#8)"],[1,"youth with a mass of wavy, black hair  overhanging his forehead, and wearing a small cap well back on his  head, strode forward towards them. Behind him came the fat youth,  struggling with a suitcase and puffing audibly.    \"Hello, you Rover boys!\" sang out the son of Songbird Powell,  cheerfully. \"I thought you might be on this train.\"    \"Glad to see you, Spouter. How are you?\" returned Jack, grasping his  hand cordially. \"Got a little friend with you, I see.\"    \"Exactly! My chum, Will Hendry. Fatty, these are the Rover boys. This  is Jack, this is Fred, and these two little innocent lambs are the  twins, Andy and Randy.\"    \"Glad to know you,\" came from all, and a general handshaking followed.    It was found that the new arrivals had two seats at the other end of  the parlor car; but there were other seats vacant near the Rover boys,  and an exchange for these was quickly made through the Pullman  conductor.    \"Say! they don't make you pay extra fare, do they?\" queried Andy, as he  looked at Fatty Hendry doing his best to squeeze into one of the  chairs.    \"Not yet. But I don't know what I'm coming to,\" puffed the stout youth.  \"Seems to me I'm taking on about a pound a day,\" he added, dolefully.    \"Maybe you eat too much,\" suggested Randy, \"Why don't you cut down on  your victuals?\"    \"Eat too much!\" puffed Will Hendry. \"I don't eat half as much as some  of you slim fellows. Why, Spouter here eats twice as much as I do!\"    \"Yes. But see the exercise I take,\" answered Dick Powell. \"I walk at  least five miles to your one. And I spend lots of time in the gym,  too--something that you cut out entirely.\"    \"Well, what would I be doing in the gym?\" demanded the fat youth. \"If I  got up on the rings or the bars, I'd pull the whole blamed business  down to the ground,\" and at this remark there was a general snicker.    Spouter Powell explained that he had been visiting Will Hendry, who  lived in the town where the two had boarded the train. He had been at  Colby Hall ever since its opening, and he had much to tell about the  school and those who attended it.    \"Oh, I'm sure you'll like it,\" declared Spouter, growing eloquent.  \"It's so delightfully situated on a hill overlooking the river, and is  surrounded by stately trees and a well-kept campus. The scene from the  front is exceedingly picturesque, while to the back the woods stretch  out for many miles. Soon, when the frost touches the leaves, the hues  and colors will be magnificent. The sparkle of the sunlight glinting  across the water----\"    \"Wow! Spouter is off again!\" puffed Fatty Hendry. \"I told you to be  careful,\" he pleaded.    \"I was only acquainting them with the beauties of Colby Hall,\"  remonstrated Spouter. \"When one comes to contemplate nature, it's  necessary to understand what real harmony----\"    \"Exactly, exactly! Just so!\" burst out Andy. \"We understand what you  mean, Spouter. But please remember the scenery is there--it won't  move--and we'll have lots of time to look at it.\"    \"Tell us about the boys who go there--and the teachers,\" broke in  Randy.    \"Yes. The teachers especially,\" added Fred.    \"Is there any hard-hearted fellow--like that Josiah Crabtree our folks  tell about?\"    \"We've got one fellow there--Professor Asa Lemm--that nobody likes,\"  answered Spouter. \"He's a language teacher. They say he was once quite  well off, and he constantly laments the loss of his wealth.\"    \"And being poor now, he tries to take it out on every pupil who comes  under him,\" finished Fatty Hendry. \"Oh, Asa is a lemon, believe me!\"    \"Well, you know what lemons grow for,\" commented Andy, mischievously.  \"They are raised to be squeezed.\"    \"And maybe we'll have to squeeze Mr. Asa Lemm--the lemon,\" added his  twin.    \"Then all the other profs are perfectly good fellows?\" questioned Jack.    \"Oh, yes! Captain Dale, our military instructor, is one of the nicest  men I ever met, and so are Professors Grawson and Brice. The others  don't seem to cut much ice one way or the other.\"    \"Tell us something about the cadets.\"    \"Any bullies there?\" queried Fred.    \"Yes; we've got one bully all right enough,\" answered Spouter.  \"Slogwell Brown is his name, but everybody calls him Slugger. He's from  the country, but he thinks he knows it all and is very overbearing.  You've got to keep your eye open for Slugger or you'll get into trouble  sure.\"    \"Thanks. I suppose we'd better give Mr. Slugger Brown a wide berth,\"  remarked Fred, dryly.    \"I don't think I'll let him ride over me,\" answered Jack, determinedly.    \"Then, there is Walter Baxter. He isn't a half bad sort, although he's  pretty hot-tempered. He had a room directly opposite Ned Lowe, who  plays the mandolin and is quite a singer. About sixty of the old  scholars are coming back, and then there will be quite a bunch of new  fellows--not less than twenty, I've been told.\"    \"Gif Garrison wrote to us and spoke about football,\" went on Jack. \"I  suppose they have some pretty good games up there?\"    \"Sure. We always have our regular eleven and a scrub eleven, and,  besides that, we have two or three games with rival schools. Gif was at  the head of the football eleven last season, and I suppose he'll be at  the head this year, although Slugger Brown would like that place.\"    So the talk ran on, the Rover boys gaining quite a little information  concerning the school to which they were bound. Then the porter came  through the car announcing the first call for lunch.    \"Say! let's go and have something to eat,\" cried Will Hendry,  struggling to his feet.    \"I thought you were going on a diet,\" remarked Andy, mischievously.    \"Sure. But I'm going to have something just the same,\" answered the fat  boy. \"Come on if you are going to the dining car. If you wait too long,  you won't be able to get a seat.\"    \"My! I shouldn't think he'd want anything to eat for a month,\"  whispered Fred to Spouter.    \"Don't you believe a word of what Fatty says about cutting down on his  food,\" returned the other in a low voice. \"He eats just as much as  anyone. That's what makes him so fat.\"    Possessed of the full appetites of growing boys, the Rovers were not  loth to follow the fat youth and Spouter into the dining car, which, to  their surprise, was almost full.    \"We'll have to have a table for four and another table for two,\"  remarked Jack to the head waiter. \"Do you think you can find that many  places?\"    \"Come this way,\" was the reply; and the party of six started for the  other end of the dining car. They were about to take the seats assigned  to them by the head waiter, when a very fussy man, accompanied by  another man, pushed forward to crowd in at one of the vacant tables.    \"Say! that's pretty cheeky,\" declared Randy. \"Now I don't know where we  are going to sit.\"    \"I'll fix you up on the other side of the car,\" said the head waiter.  The appearance of the boys had rather pleased him, while he did not  like the actions of the fussy man and his companion at all.    Spouter and his fat chum were behind the Rovers, so they did not see  the face of the fussy individual who had deprived the lads of one of  the seats. They sat down on the other side of the aisle, and the Rover  boys spread themselves around as best they could.    Fred and Jack had just sat down and Randy was doing likewise, when one  of the waiters came through the swaying car carrying a tray filled with  eatables. Suddenly the car gave an extra lurch, and Andy was thrown up  against the waiter in such a manner that the tray tilted from the  colored man's hand, and an instant later the contents of a large  platter containing a broiled steak with some French-fried potatoes was  deposited over the neck and shoulders of the fussy man in the seat near  by.    [Illustration: THE TRAY TILTED FROM THE COLORED MAN'S HAND.  _Page_ 64]    \"Oh!\" roared the man, starting up in great anger. \"What do you mean by  this? What do you mean, I say?\" he shrilled.    At the sound of this voice, Spouter Powell and Fatty Hendry looked up  in sudden wonder. Then, as some of the Rover boys commenced to laugh  over the mishap, Spouter clutched Jack by the arm.    \"That man is Professor Asa Lemm!\" he whispered.          CHAPTER VII    A SCENE IN THE DINING CAR      \"You don't mean it!\" gasped Jack. \"The lemon of a professor we were  just talking about?\"    \"That's it!\"    \"Then I'm afraid Andy has gotten himself into trouble right at the  start.\"    \"It wasn't his fault. It was the lurching of the train did it,\" put in  Fred.    \"Just the same, I'd hate to be in your cousin's shoes,\" was Fatty  Hendry's comment.    In the meanwhile the waiter, by a lightning-like move, had managed to  save the broiled steak from slipping to the floor of the dining car. He  now had it on the platter, but the French-fried potatoes were scattered  in all directions.    \"What do you mean, I say?\" repeated Professor Asa Lemm in a loud, harsh  voice.    \"Scuse it, boss,\" answered the waiter humbly. \"'Twas the swingin' o' de  car what done it. Besides, one o' dem passengers knocked agin my arm.\"    \"I think it was that boy's fault quite as much as the waiter's,\" came  from the man who was accompanying Professor Lemm.    \"I couldn't help it,\" answered Andy. \"The car gave such a sudden lurch  that I was almost thrown off my feet.\"    \"We'll fix this all up, sir,\" broke in the head waiter, coming to the  front. \"Take that steak back to the kitchen and bring some more  potatoes,\" he added to the waiter. \"I am glad to say it hasn't mussed  you up very much;\" and he handed the professor a fingerbowl full of  water and an extra napkin.    A number of passengers had witnessed the accident and were smiling  broadly. Spouter and Fatty Hendry were also on a broad grin, but their  faces took on a sudden sober look when they found Asa Lemm's gaze  directed toward them.    \"Ha! so you are here,\" was the teacher's comment. \"What business have  you to laugh?\"    \"Excuse me, "]]]
