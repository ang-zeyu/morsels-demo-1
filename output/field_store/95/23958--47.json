He fled with  the company's money to Italy, and actually got himself captured by sham  brigands in his own pay, so as to explain both the disappearance of  the money and the disappearance of himself. That demand for ransom was  really taken seriously by most of the police. But for years he's been  doing things as good as that, quite as good as that. He will be a  serious loss to his family.\"    Muscari was leading away the unhappy daughter, who held hard to him, as  she did for many a year after. But even in that tragic wreck he could  not help having a smile and a hand of half-mocking friendship for the  indefensible Ezza Montano. \"And where are you going next?\" he asked him  over his shoulder.    \"Birmingham,\" answered the actor, puffing a cigarette. \"Didn't I tell  you I was a Futurist? I really do believe in those things if I believe  in anything. Change, bustle and new things every morning. I am going to  Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Huddersfield, Glasgow, Chicago--in  short, to enlightened, energetic, civilized society!\"    \"In short,\" said Muscari, \"to the real Paradise of Thieves.\"            THREE -- The Duel of Dr Hirsch      M. MAURICE BRUN and M. Armand Armagnac were crossing the sunlit Champs  Elysee with a kind of vivacious respectability. They were both short,  brisk and bold. They both had black beards that did not seem to belong  to their faces, after the strange French fashion which makes real hair  look like artificial. M. Brun had a dark wedge of beard apparently  affixed under his lower lip. M. Armagnac, by way of a change, had two  beards; one sticking out from each corner of his emphatic chin. They  were both young. They were both atheists, with a depressing fixity of  outlook but great mobility of exposition. They were both pupils of the  great Dr Hirsch, scientist, publicist and moralist.    M. Brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common expression  \"Adieu\" should be obliterated from all the French classics, and a slight  fine imposed for its use in private life. \"Then,\" he said, \"the very  name of your imagined God will have echoed for the last time in the ear  of man.\" M. Armagnac specialized rather in a resistance to militarism,  and wished the chorus of the Marseillaise altered from \"Aux armes,  citoyens\" to \"Aux greves, citoyens\". But his antimilitarism was of a  peculiar and Gallic sort. An eminent and very wealthy English Quaker,  who had come to see him to arrange for the disarmament of the whole  planet, was rather distressed by Armagnac's proposal that (by way of  beginning) the soldiers should shoot their officers.    And indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most from  their leader and father in philosophy. Dr Hirsch, though born in France  and covered with the most triumphant favours of French education, was  temperamentally of another type--mild, dreamy, humane; and, despite his  sceptical system, not devoid of transcendentalism. He was, in short,  more like a German than a Frenchman; and much as they admired him,  something in the subconsciousness of these Gauls was irritated at his  pleading for peace in so peaceful a manner. To their party throughout  Europe, however, Paul Hirsch was a saint of science. His large and  daring cosmic theories advertised his austere life and innocent, if  somewhat frigid, morality; he held something of the position of Darwin  doubled with the position of Tolstoy. But he was neither an anarchist  nor an antipatriot; his views on disarmament were moderate and  evolutionary--the Republican Government put considerable confidence in  him as to various chemical improvements. He had lately even discovered  a noiseless explosive, the secret of which the Government was carefully  guarding.    His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee--a street which in  that strong summer seemed almost as full of foliage as the park itself;  a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine, interrupted only in one place  where a large cafe ran out into the street. Almost opposite to this  were the white and green blinds of the great scientist's house, an iron  balcony, also painted green, running along in front of the first-floor  windows. Beneath this was the entrance into a kind of court, gay with  shrubs and tiles, into which the two Frenchmen passed in animated talk.    The door was opened to them by the doctor's old servant, Simon, who  might very well have passed for a doctor himself, having a strict suit  of black, spectacles, grey hair, and a confidential manner. In fact, he  was a far more presentable man of science than his master, Dr Hirsch,  who was a forked radish of a fellow, with just enough bulb of a head to  make his body insignificant. With all the gravity of a great physician  handling a prescription, Simon handed a letter to M. Armagnac. That  gentleman ripped it up with a racial impatience, and rapidly read the  following:    I cannot come down to speak to you. There is a man in this house whom I  refuse to meet. He is a Chauvinist officer, Dubosc. He is sitting on the  stairs. He has been kicking the furniture about in all the other rooms;  I have locked myself in my study, opposite that cafe. If you love me,  go over to the cafe and wait at one of the tables outside. I will try  to send him over to you. I want you to answer him and deal with him. I  cannot meet him myself. I cannot: I will not.    There is going to be another Dreyfus case.    P. HIRSCH        M. Armagnac looked at M. Brun. M. Brun borrowed the letter, read it, and  looked at M. Armagnac. Then both betook themselves briskly to one of the  little tables under the chestnuts opposite, where they procured two tall  glasses of horrible green absinthe, which they could drink apparently in  any weather and at any time. Otherwise the cafe seemed empty, except  for one soldier drinking coffee at one table, and at another a large man  drinking a small syrup and a priest drinking nothing.    Maurice Brun cleared his throat and said: \"Of course we must help the  master in every way, but--\"    There was an abrupt silence, and Armagnac said: \"He may have excellent  reasons for not meeting the man himself, but--\"    Before either could complete a sentence, it was evident that the invader  had been expelled from the house opposite. The shrubs under the archway  swayed and burst apart, as that unwelcome guest was shot out of them  like a cannon-ball.    He was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat, a  figure that had indeed something generally Tyrolean about it. The man's  shoulders were big and broad, but his legs were neat and active in  knee-breeches and knitted stockings. His face was brown like a nut; he  had very bright and restless brown eyes; his dark hair was brushed  back stiffly in front and cropped close behind, outlining a square and  powerful skull; and he had a huge black moustache like the horns of a  bison. Such a substantial head is generally based on a bull neck; but  this was hidden by a big coloured scarf, swathed round up the man's ears  and falling in front inside his jacket like a sort of fancy waistcoat.  It was a scarf of strong dead colours, dark red and old gold and purple,  probably of Oriental fabrication. Altogether the man had something a  shade barbaric about him; more like a Hungarian squire than an ordinary  French officer. His French, however, was obviously that of a native;  and his French patriotism was so impulsive as to be slightly absurd.  His first act when he burst out of the archway was to call in a clarion  voice down the street: \"Are there any Frenchmen here?\" as if he were  calling for Christians in Mecca.    Armagnac and Brun instantly stood up; but they were too late. Men  were already running from the street corners; there was a small but  ever-clustering crowd. With the prompt French instinct for the politics  of the street, the man with the black moustache had already run across  to a corner of the cafe, sprung on one of the tables, and seizing a  branch of chestnut to steady himself, shouted as Camille Desmoulins once  shouted when he scattered the oak-leaves among the populace.    \"Frenchmen!\" he volleyed; \"I cannot speak! God help me, that is why I  am speaking! The fellows in their filthy parliaments who learn to  speak also learn to be silent--silent as that spy cowering in the house  opposite! Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door! Silent as he  is now, though he hears my voice across this street and shakes where he  sits! Oh, they can be silent eloquently--the politicians! But the time  has come when we that cannot speak must speak. You are betrayed to the  Prussians. Betrayed at this moment. Betrayed by that man. I am Jules  Dubosc, Colonel of Artillery, Belfort. We caught a German spy in the  Vosges yesterday, and a paper was found on him--a paper I hold in my  hand. Oh, they tried to hush it up; but I took it direct to the man who  wrote it--the man in that house! It is in his hand. It is signed with  his initials. It is a direction for finding the secret of this new  Noiseless Powder. Hirsch invented it; Hirsch wrote this note about it.  This note is in German, and was found in a German's pocket. 'Tell the  man the formula for powder is in grey envelope in first drawer to the  left of Secretary's desk, War Office, in red ink. He must be careful.  P.H.'\"    He rattled short sentences like a quick-firing gun, but he was plainly  the sort of man who is either mad or right. The mass of the crowd  was Nationalist, and already in threatening uproar; and a minority of  equally angry Intellectuals, led by Armagnac and Brun, only made the  majority more militant.    \"If this is a military secret,\" shouted Brun, \"why do you yell about it  in the street?\"    \"I will tell you why I do!\" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd. \"I  went to this man in straight and civil style. If he had any explanation  it could have been given in complete confidence. He refuses"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States. Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,". Let him do his best, and I will do mine.\"    The envoy returned to his craft, and made his report. The next day  hostilities opened. Wheeling his ships into line before the  fortifications, Phipps opened a heavy fire upon the city. From the  frowning ramparts on the heights, Frontenac's cannon answered in kind.  Fiercely the contest raged until nightfall, and vast was the  consumption of gunpowder; but damage done on either side was but  little. All night the belligerents rested on their arms; but, at  daybreak, the roar of the cannonade recommenced.    The gunners of the opposing forces were now upon their mettle, and the  gunnery was much better than the day before. A shot from the shore cut  the flagstaff of the admiral's ship, and the cross of St. George fell  into the river. Straightway a canoe put out from the shore, and with  swift, strong paddle-strokes was guided in chase of the floating  trophy. The fire of the fleet was quickly concentrated upon the  adventurous canoeists. Cannon-balls and rifle-bullets cut the water  about them; but their frail craft survived the leaden tempest, and  they captured the trophy, and bore it off in triumph.    Phipps felt that the incident was an unfavorable omen, and would  discourage his men. He cast about in his mind for a means of  retaliation. Far over the roofs of the city rose a tapering spire,  that of the cathedral in the Upper Town. On this spire, the devout  Catholics of the French city had hung a picture of the Holy Family as  an invocation of Divine aid. Through his spy-glass, Phipps could see  that some strange object hung from the steeple, and, suspecting its  character, commanded the gunners to try to knock it down. For hours  the Puritans wasted their ammunition in this vain target-practice, but  to no avail. The picture still hung on high; and the devout Frenchmen  ascribed its escape to a miracle, although its destruction would have  been more miraculous still.    It did not take long to convince Phipps that in this contest his fleet  was getting badly worsted, and he soon withdrew his vessels to a place  of safety. The flag-ship had been fairly riddled with shot; and her  rigging was so badly cut, that she could only get out of range of the  enemy's guns by cutting her cables, and drifting away with the  current. Her example was soon followed by the remaining vessels.    Sorely crestfallen, Phipps abandoned the fight, and prepared to return  to Boston. His voyage thither was stormy; and three or four of his  vessels never were heard of, having been dashed to pieces by the  waves, or cast away upon the iron-bound coast of Nova Scotia or Maine.  His expedition was the most costly in lives and in treasure ever  undertaken by a single colony, and, despite its failure, forms the  most notable incident in the naval annals of the colonies prior to the  Revolution.    The French colonies continued to be a fruitful source of war and  turmoil. Many were the joint military and naval expeditions fitted out  against them by the British colonies. Quebec, Louisbourg, and Port  Royal were all threatened; and the two latter were captured by  colonial expeditions. From a naval point of view, these expeditions  were but trifling. They are of some importance, however, in that they  gave the colonists an opportunity to try their prowess on the ocean;  and in this irregular service were bred some sailors who fought right  valiantly for the rebellious colonies against the king, and others who  did no less valiant service under the royal banner.          CHAPTER III.         OPENING OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. -- THE AFFAIR OF THE       SCHOONER \"ST. JOHN.\" -- THE PRESS-GANG AND ITS WORK. -- THE       SLOOP \"LIBERTY.\" -- DESTRUCTION OF THE \"GASPEE.\" -- THE       BOSTON TEA-PARTY.      It is unnecessary to enter into an account of the causes that led up  to the revolt of the American Colonies against the oppression of King  George and his subservient Parliament. The story of the Stamp Act, the  indignation of the Colonies, their futile attempts to convince  Parliament of the injustice of the measure, the stern measures adopted  by the British to put down the rising insubordination, the Boston  Massacre, and the battles at Concord and Lexington are familiar to  every American boy. But not every young American knows that almost the  first act of open resistance to the authority of the king took place  on the water, and was to some extent a naval action.    The revenue laws, enacted by the English Parliament as a means of  extorting money from the Colonies, were very obnoxious to the people  of America. Particularly did the colonists of Rhode Island protest  against them, and seldom lost an opportunity to evade the payment of  the taxes.    Between Providence and Newport, illicit trade flourished; and the  waters of Narragansett Bay were dotted with the sail of small craft  carrying cargoes on which no duties had ever been paid. In order to  stop this nefarious traffic, armed vessels were stationed in the Bay,  with orders to chase and search all craft suspected of smuggling. The  presence of these vessels gave great offence to the colonists, and the  inflexible manner in which the naval officers discharged their duty  caused more than one open defiance of the authority of King George.    The first serious trouble to grow out of the presence of the British  cruisers in the bay was the affair of the schooner \"St. John.\" This  vessel was engaged in patrolling the waters of the bay in search of  smugglers. While so engaged, her commander, Lieut. Hill, learned that  a brig had discharged a suspicious cargo at night near Howland's  Ferry. Running down to that point to investigate, the king's officers  found the cargo to consist of smuggled goods; and, leaving a few men  in charge, the cruiser hastily put out to sea in pursuit of the  smuggler. The swift sailing schooner soon overtook the brig, and the  latter was taken in to Newport as a prize. Although this affair  occurred early in 1764, the sturdy colonists even then had little  liking for the officers of the king. The sailors of the \"St. John,\"  careless of the evident dislike of the citizens of the town, swaggered  about the streets, boasting of their capture, and making merry at the  expense of the Yankees. Two or three fights between sailors and  townspeople so stirred up the landsmen, that they determined to  destroy the \"St. John,\" and had actually fitted up an armed sloop for  that purpose, when a second man-of-war appeared in the harbor and put  a final stopper to the project. Though thus balked of their revenge,  the townspeople showed their hatred for the king's navy by seizing a  battery, and firing several shots at the two armed vessels, but  without effect.    During the same year, the little town of Newport again gave evidence  of the growth of the revolutionary spirit. This time the good old  British custom of procuring sailors for the king's ships by a system  of kidnapping, commonly known as impressment, was the cause of the  outbreak. For some months the British man-of-war \"Maidstone\" lay in  the harbor of Newport, idly tugging at her anchors. It was a period of  peace, and her officers had nothing to occupy their attention.  Therefore they devoted themselves to increasing the crew of the vessel  by means of raids upon the taverns along the water-front of the city.    The seafaring men of Newport knew little peace while the \"Maidstone\"  was in port. The king's service was the dread of every sailor; and,  with the press-gang nightly walking the streets, no sailor could feel  secure. All knew the life led by the sailors on the king's ships.  Those were the days when the cat-o'-nine-tails flourished, and the  command of a beardless bit of a midshipmen was enough to send a poor  fellow to the gratings, to have his back cut to pieces by the  merciless lash. The Yankee sailors had little liking for this phase of  sea-life, and they gave the men-of-war a wide berth.    Often it happened, however, that a party of jolly mariners sitting  over their pipes and grog in the snug parlor of some seashore tavern,  spinning yarns of the service they had seen on the gun-decks of his  Majesty's ships, or of shipwreck and adventure in the merchant  service, would start up and listen in affright, as the measured tramp  of a body of men came up the street. Then came the heavy blow on the  door.    \"Open in the king's name,\" shouts a gruff voice outside; and the  entrapped sailors, overturning the lights, spring for doors and  windows, in vain attempts to escape the fate in store for them. The  press-gang seldom returned to the ship empty handed, and the luckless  tar who once fell into their clutches was wise to accept his capture  good-naturedly; for the bos'n's cat was the remedy commonly prescribed  for sulkiness.    As long as the \"Maidstone\" lay in the harbor of Newport, raids such as  this were of common occurrence. The people of the city grumbled a  little; but it was the king's will, and none dared oppose it. The  wives and sweethearts of the kidnapped sailors shed many a bitter tear  over the disappearance of their husbands and lovers; but what were the  tears of women to King George? And so the press-gang of the  \"Maidstone\" might have continued to enjoy unopposed the stirring sport  of hunting men like beasts, had the leaders not committed one  atrocious act of inhumanity that roused the long-suffering people to  resistance.    One breezy afternoon, a stanch brig, under full sail, came up the bay,  and entered the harbor of Newport. Her sides were weather-beaten, and  her dingy sails and patched cordage showed that she had just completed  her long voyage. Her crew, a fine set of bronzed and hardy sailors,  were gathered on her forecastle, eagerly regarding the cluster of  cottages that made up the little town of Newport. In those cottages  were many loved ones, wives, mothers, and sweethearts, whom the brave  fellows"]]]
