Thus Europe saw, in the first transaction of this reign, the genius and  capacity of the queen and her ministers. She discerned at a distance  the danger which threatened her; and instantly took vigorous measures  to prevent it. Making all possible advantages of her situation, she  proceeded with celerity to a decision; and was not diverted by any  offers, negotiations, or remonstrances of the French court. She stopped  not till she had brought the matter to a final issue; and had converted  that very power, to which her enemies trusted for her destruction, into  her firmest support and security. By exacting no improper conditions  from the Scottish malecontents, even during their greatest distresses,  she established an entire confidence with them; and having cemented  the union by all the ties of gratitude, interest, and religion, she now  possessed an influence over them beyond what remained even with their  native sovereign. The regard which she acquired by this dexterous and  spirited conduct, gave her every where, abroad as well as at home, more  authority than had attended her sister, though supported by all the  power of the Spanish monarchy.[*]    The subsequent measures of the Scottish reformers tended still more  to cement their union with England. Being now entirely masters of the  kingdom, they made no further ceremony or scruple in fully effecting  their purpose. In the treaty of Edinburgh, it had been agreed, that a  parliament or convention should soon be assembled; and the leaders of  the congregation, not waiting till the queen of Scots should ratify  that treaty, thought themselves fully entitled, without the sovereign's  authority, immediately to summon a parliament. The reformers presented  a petition to this assembly, in which they were not contented with  desiring the establishment of their doctrine, they also applied for  the punishment of the Catholics, whom they called vassals to the Roman  harlot; and they asserted, that among all the rabble of the clergy--such  is their expression--there was not one lawful minister; but that they  were all of them thieves and murderers; yea, rebels and traitors to  civil authority, and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any reformed  commonwealth.[**] The parliament seem to have been actuated by the same  spirit of rage and persecution. After ratifying a confession of faith  agreeable to the new doctrines, they passed a statute against the mass,  and not only abolished it in all the churches, but enacted, that whoever  any where either officiated in it, or was present at it, should be  chastised, for the first offence, with confiscation of goods and  corporal punishment, at the discretion of the magistrate; for the  second, with banishment; and for the third, with loss of life.[***]         * Forbes, vol. i. p. 354, 372. Jebb, vol. ii. p. 452.         ** Knox, p. 237. 238.         *** Knox, p. 254.    A law was also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in Scotland:  the Presbyterian form of discipline was settled, leaving only at first  some shadow of authority to certain ecclesiastics, whom they called  superintendents. The prelates of the ancient faith appeared, in order to  complain of great injustice committed on them by the invasion of their  property, but the parliament took no notice of them; till at last these  ecclesiastics, tired with fruitless attendance, departed the town. They  were then cited to appear; and as nobody presented himself, it was voted  by the parliament, that the ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied, and  found no reason of complaint.    Sir James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was sent over to France to  obtain the ratification of these acts; but was very ill received by  Mary, who denied the validity of a parliament summoned without the  royal consent; and she refused her sanction to those statutes. But the  Protestants gave themselves little concern about their queen's refusal.  They immediately put the statutes in execution; they abolished the  mass; they settled their ministers; they committed every where furious  devastations on the monasteries, and even on the churches, which they  thought profaned by idolatry; and deeming the property of the clergy  lawful prize, they took possession, without ceremony, of the far greater  part of the ecclesiastical revenues. Their new preachers, who had  authority sufficient to incite them to war and insurrection, could not  restrain their rapacity; and fanaticism concurring with avarice, an  incurable wound was given to the papal authority in that country. The  Protestant nobility and gentry, united by the consciousness of such  unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their new possessions, well acquainted  with the imperious character of the house of Guise, saw no safety for  themselves but in the protection of England; and they despatched Morton,  Glencarne, and Lidington, to express their sincere gratitude to the  queen for her past favors, and represent to her the necessity of  continuing them.    Elizabeth, on her part, had equal reason to maintain a union with  the Scottish Protestants; and soon found that the house of Guise,  notwithstanding their former disappointments, had not laid aside the  design of contesting her title, and subverting her authority. Francis  and Mary, whose counsels were wholly directed by them, refused to  ratify the treaty of Edinburgh and showed no disposition to give her  any satisfaction for that mortal affront which they had put upon her, by  their openly assuming the title and arms of England. She was sensible  of the danger attending such pretensions; and it was with pleasure she  heard of the violent factions which prevailed in the French government,  and of the opposition which had arisen against the measures of the duke  of Guise. That ambitious prince, supported by his four brothers, the  cardinal of Lorraine, the duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the  grand prior, men no less ambitious than himself, had engrossed all the  authority of the crown; and as he was possessed of every quality which  could command the esteem or seduce the affections of men, there appeared  no end of his acquisitions and pretensions. The constable, Montmorency,  who had long balanced his credit, was deprived of all power: the princes  of the blood, the king of Navarre, and his brother, the prince of Conde,  were entirely excluded from offices and favor: the queen mother herself,  Catharine de Medicis, found her influence every day declining; and  as Francis, a young prince, infirm both in mind and body, was wholly  governed by his consort, who knew no law but the pleasure of her uncles,  men despaired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that  aspiring family. It was the contests of religion which first inspired  the French with courage openly to oppose their unlimited authority.    The theological disputes, first started in the north of Germany, next  in Switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had long  ago penetrated into France; and as they were assisted by the general  discontent against the court and church of Rome, and by the zealous  spirit of the age, the proselytes to the new religion were secretly  increasing in every province. Henry II., in imitation of his father,  Francis, had opposed the progress of the reformers; and though a prince  addicted to pleasure and society, he was transported by a vehemence,  as well as bigotry, which had little place in the conduct of his  predecessor. Rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent  of the Protestant party; and a point of honor seemed to have arisen,  whether the one sect could exercise, or the other suffer, most  barbarity. The death of Henry put some stop to the persecutions; and the  people, who had admired the constancy of the new preachers, now heard  with favor their doctrines and arguments. But the cardinal of Lorraine,  as well as his brothers, who were possessed of the legal authority,  thought it their interest to support the established religion; and when  they revived the execution of the penal statutes, they necessarily drove  the malecontent princes and nobles to embrace the protection of the new  religion. The king of Navarre, a man of mild dispositions, but of a weak  character, and the prince of Conde, who possessed many great qualities,  having declared themselves in favor of the Protestants, that sect  acquired new force from their countenance; and the admiral, Coligny,  with his brother Andelot, no longer scrupled to make open profession of  their communion. The integrity of the admiral, who was believed sincere  in his attachment to the new doctrine, and his great reputation both  for valor and conduct, for the arts of peace as well as of war  brought credit to the reformers; and after a frustrated attempt of the  malecontents to seize the king's person at Amboise of which Elizabeth  had probably some intelligence,[*] every place was full of distraction,  and matters hastened to an open rupture between the parties. But the  house of Guise, though these factions had obliged them to remit their  efforts in Scotland, and had been one chief cause of Elizabeth's  success, were determined not to relinquish their authority in France,  or yield to the violence of their enemies. They found an opportunity  of seizing the king of Navarre and the prince of Conde; they threw  the former into prison; they obtained a sentence of death against the  latter; and they were proceeding to put the sentence in execution, when  the king's sudden death saved the noble prisoner, and interrupted the  prosperity of the duke of Guise. The queen mother was appointed regent  to her son Charles IX., now in his minority: the king of Navarre was  named lieutenant-general of the kingdom:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#8)"],[1,"London, and strongly solicited  Charles to embrace the protection of these distressed religionists. He  represented, that after the inhabitants of Rochelle had been repressed  by the combined squadrons of England and Holland, after peace was  concluded with the French king under Charles's mediation, the ambitious  cardinal was still meditating the destruction of the Hugonots: that  preparations were silently making in every province of France for the  suppression of their religion; that forts were erected in order to  bridle Rochelle, the most considerable bulwark of the Protestants; that  the reformed in France cast their eyes on Charles as the head of their  faith, and considered him as a prince engaged by interest, as well as  inclination, to support them; that so long as their party subsisted,  Charles might rely on their attachment as much as on that of his own  subjects; but if their liberties were once ravished from them, the power  of France, freed from this impediment, would soon become formidable to  England, and to all the neighboring nations.    Though Charles probably bore but small favor to the Hugonots, who so  much resembled the Puritans in discipline and worship, in religion  and politics, he yet allowed himself to be gained by these arguments,  enforced by the solicitations of Buckingham. A fleet of a hundred sail,  and an army of seven thousand men, were fitted out for the invasion of  France, and both of them intrusted to the command of the duke, who  was altogether unacquainted both with land and sea service. The fleet  appeared before Rochelle; but so ill concerted were Buckingham's  measures, that the inhabitants of that city shut their gates and refused  to admit allies of whose coming they were not previously informed.[*]  All his military operations showed equal incapacity and inexperience.  Instead of attacking Oleron, a fertile island, and defenceless, he bent  his course to the Isle of Rhe, which was well garrisoned and fortified:  having landed his men, though with some loss, he followed not the blow,  but allowed Toiras, the French governor, five days' respite, during  which St. Martin was victualled and provided for a siege.[**]         * Rushworth, vol i. p. 426.         ** Whitlocke, p. 8. Sir Philip Warwick, p. 25.    He left behind him the small fort of Prie, which could at first have  made no manner of resistance: though resolved to starve St. Martin, he  guarded the sea negligently, and allowed provisions and ammunition to  be thrown into it: despairing to reduce it by famine, he attacked it  without having made any breach, and rashly threw away the lives of  the soldiers: having found that a French army had stolen over in small  divisions, and had landed at Prie, the fort which he had at first  overlooked, he began to think of a retreat; but made it so unskilfully,  that it was equivalent to a total rout; he was the last of the army that  embarked; and he returned to England, having lost two thirds of his  land forces; totally discredited both as an admiral and a general; and  bringing no praise with him, but the vulgar one of courage and personal  bravery.    The duke of Rohan, who had taken arms as soon as Buckingham appeared  upon the coast, discovered the dangerous spirit of the sect, without  being able to do any mischief; the inhabitants of Rochelle, who had at  last been induced to join the English, hastened the vengeance of their  master, exhausted their provisions in supplying their allies, and were  threatened with an immediate siege. Such were the fruits of Buckingham's  expedition against France.            CHAPTER LI.          CHARLES I.    {1628.} There was reason to apprehend some disorder or insurrection  from the discontents which prevailed among the people in England.  Their liberties, they believed, were ravished from them; illegal taxes  extorted; their commerce which had met with a severe check from the  Spanish, was totally annihilated by the French war; those military  honors transmitted to them from their ancestors, had received a grievous  stain by two unsuccessful and ill-conducted expeditions; scarce an  illustrious family but mourned, from the last of them, the loss of a  son or brother; greater calamities were dreaded from the war with these  powerful monarchies, concurring with the internal disorders under which  the nation labored. And these ills were ascribed, not to the refractory  disposition of the two former parliaments, to which they were partly  owing, but solely to Charles's obstinacy in adhering to the counsels of  Buckingham, a man nowise entitled by his birth, age, services, or merit,  to that unlimited confidence reposed in him. To be sacrificed to the  interest, policy, and ambition of the great, is so much the common lot  of the people, that they may appear unreasonable who would pretend to  complain of it: but to be the victim of the frivolous gallantry of a  favorite, and of his boyish caprices, seemed the object of peculiar  indignation.    In this situation, it may be imagined the king and the duke dreaded,  above all things, the assembling of a parliament; but so little  foresight had they possessed in their enterprising schemes, that  they found themselves under an absolute necessity of embracing that  expedient. The money levied, or rather extorted, under color of  prerogative, had come in very slowly, and had left such ill humor in the  nation, that it appeared dangerous to renew the experiment. The absolute  necessity of supply, it was hoped, would engage the commons to forget  all past injuries; and, having experienced the ill effects of former  obstinacy, they would probably assemble with a resolution of making some  reasonable compliances. The more to soften them, it was concerted,  by Sir Robert Cotton's advice,[*] that Buckingham should be the first  person that proposed in council the calling of a new parliament.  Having laid in this stock of merit, he expected that all his former  misdemeanors would be overlooked and forgiven; and that, instead of a  tyrant and oppressor, he should be regarded as the first patriot in the  nation.    The views of the popular leaders were much more judicious and profound.  When the commons assembled, they appeared to be men of the same  independent spirit with their predecessors, and possessed of such  riches, that their property was computed to surpass three times that  of the house of peers;[**] they were deputed by boroughs and counties,  inflamed all of them by the late violations of liberty; many of the  members themselves had been cast into prison, and had suffered by the  measures of the court; yet, notwithstanding these circumstances, which  might prompt them to embrace violent resolutions, they entered upon  business with perfect temper and decorum. They considered that the king,  disgusted at these popular assemblies, and little prepossessed in favor  of their privileges, wanted but a fair pretence for breaking with them,  and would seize the first opportunity offered by any incident, or any  undutiful behavior of the members. He fairly told them in his first  speech, that, \"If they should not do their duties in contributing to the  necessities of the state, he must, in discharge of his conscience, use  those other means which God had put into his hands, in order to save  that which the follies of some particular men may otherwise put in  danger. Take not this for a threatening,\" added the king, \"for I scorn  to threaten any but my equals; but as an admonition from him who,  by nature and duty, has most care of your preservation and  prosperity.\"[***] The lord keeper, by the king's direction, subjoined,  \"This way of parliamentary supplies as his majesty told you, he hath  chosen, not as the only way, but as the fittest; not because he is  destitute of others, but because it is most agreeable to the goodness  of his own most gracious disposition, and to the desire and weal of his  people. If this be deferred, necessity and the sword of the enemy make  way for the others. Remember his majesty's admonition. I say, remember  it.\"[****]         * Franklyn, p. 230.         ** Sanderson, p. 106. Walker, p. 339         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 477. Franklyn, p. 233.         **** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 479. Franklyn, p. 234    From these avowed maxims, the commons foresaw that, if the least handle  were afforded, the king would immediately dissolve them, and would  thenceforward deem himself justified for violating, in a manner still  more open, all the ancient forms of the constitution. No remedy could  then be looked for but from insurrections and civil war, of which the  issue would be extremely uncertain, and which must, in all events,  prove calamitous to the nation. To correct the late disorders in the  administration required some new laws, which would, no doubt, appear  harsh to a prince so enamored of his prerogative; and it was requisite  to temper, by the decency and moderation of their debates, the rigor  which must necessarily attend their determinations. Nothing can give us  a higher idea of the capacity of those men who now guided the commons,  and of the great authority which they had acquired, than the forming and  executing of so judicious and so difficult a plan of operations.    The decency, however, which the popular leaders had prescribed to  themselves, and recommended to others, hindered them not from making the  loudest and most vigorous complaints against the grievances under which  the nation had lately labored. Sir Francis Seymour said, \"This is the  great council of the kingdom; and here with certainty, if not here only,  his majesty may see, as in a true glass, the state of the kingdom. We  are called hither by his writs, in order to give him faithful counsel;  such as may stand with his honor: and this we must do without flattery.  We are also sent hither by the people, in order to deliver their just  grievances: and this we must do without"]]]
