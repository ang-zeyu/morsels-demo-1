FIRST REQUIREMENTS FOR DESIGNING.--First, then, let us see what is  necessary to do when you intend to set about making an article. Suppose  we fix our minds upon a table as the article selected. Three things are  necessary to know: First, the use to which it is to be put; second, the  dimensions; and, third, the material required.    Assuming it to be the ordinary table, and the dimensions fixed, we may  conclude to use soft pine, birch or poplar, because of ease in working.  There are no regulation dimensions for tables, except as to height,  which is generally uniform, and usually 30 inches. As to the length and  width, you will be governed by the place where it is to be used.    If the table top is to have dimensions, say, of 36\" x 48\", you may lay  out the framework six inches less each way, thus giving you a top  overhang of three inches, which is the usual practice.    CONVENTIONAL STYLES.--Now, if you wish to depart from the conventional  style of making a table you may make variations in the design. For  instance, the Chippendale style means slender legs and thin top. It  involves some fanciful designs in the curved outlines of the top, and in  the crook of the legs. Or if, on the other hand, the Mission type is  preferred, the overhang of the top is very narrow; the legs are straight  and heavy, and of even size from top to bottom; and the table top is  thick and nearly as broad as it is long. Such furniture has the  appearance of massiveness; it is easily made and most serviceable.    MISSION STYLE.--The Mission style of architecture also lends itself to  the making of chairs and other articles of furniture. A chair is,  probably, the most difficult piece of household furniture to make,  because strength is required. In this type soft wood may be used, as the  large legs and back pieces are easily provided with mortises and tenons,  affording great rigidity when completed. In designing, therefore, you  may see how the material itself becomes an important factor.    CABINETS.--In the making of cabinets, sideboards, dressers and like  articles, the ingenious boy will find a wonderful field for designing  ability, because in these articles fancy alone dictates the sizes and  the dimensions of the parts. Not so with chairs and tables. The  imagination plays an important part even in the making of drawers, to  say nothing of placing them with an eye to convenience and artistic  effect.    HARMONY OF PARTS.--But one thing should be observed in the making of  furniture, namely, harmony between the parts. For instance, a table  with thin legs and a thick top gives the appearance of a top-heavy  structure; or the wrong use of two different styles is bad from an  artistic standpoint; moreover, it is the height of refined education if,  in the use of contrasting woods, they are properly blended to form a  harmonious whole.    HARMONIZING WOOD.--Imagine a chiffonier with the base of dark wood, like  walnut, and the top of pine or maple, or a like light-colored wood. On  the other hand, both walnut and maple, for instance, may be used in the  same article, if they are interspersed throughout the entire article.  The body may be made of dark wood and trimmed throughout with a light  wood to produce a fine effect.          CHAPTER V    HOW WORK IS LAID OUT      CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF WORK.--A concrete example of doing any work is more  valuable than an abstract statement. For this purpose I shall direct the  building of a common table with a drawer in it and show how the work is  done in detail.    For convenience let us adopt the Mission style, with a top 36\" x 42\" and  the height 30\". The legs should be 2\" x 2\" and the top 1\", dressed. The  material should be of hard wood with natural finish, or, what is better  still, a soft wood, like birch, which may be stained a dark brown, as  the Mission style is more effective in dark than in light woods.    [Illustration: _Fig. 27._]    FRAMEWORK.--As we now know the sizes, the first thing is to build the  framework. The legs should be dressed square and smoothed down with the  fore plane to make them perfectly straight. Now, lay out two mortises at  the upper end of each leg. Follow the illustrations to see how this is  done.    LAYING OUT THE LEGS.--Fig. 27 shows a leg with square cross marks (A) at  each end. These marks indicate the finished length of the leg. You will  also see crosses on two sides. These indicate what is called the \"work  sides.\" The work sides are selected because they are the finest surfaces  on the leg.    [Illustration: _Fig. 28._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 29._]    THE LENGTH OF THE MORTISES.--Then take a small try square (Fig. 28) and  add two cross lines (B, C) on each of the inner surfaces, the second  line (B) one-half inch from the finish line (A), and the other line (C)  seven inches down from the line (A). The side facing boards, hereafter  described, are seven inches wide.    When this has been done for all the legs, prepare your gage (Fig. 29) to  make the mortise scribe, and, for convenience in illustrating, the leg  is reversed. If the facing boards are 1\" thick, and the tenons are  intended to be 1/2\" thick, the first scribe line (E) should be 1/2\" from  the work side, because the shoulder on the facing board projects out  1/4\", and the outer surface of the facing board should not be flush with  the outer surface of the leg. The second gage line (F) should be 1\" from  the work side.    [Illustration: _Fig. 30._]    THE MORTISES.--When the mortises have been made they will appear as  shown in the enlarged cross section of the leg (Fig. 30), the total  depth of each mortise being 1-1/2\". The depth of this mortise determines  for us the length of the tenons on the facing boards.    THE FACING BOARDS.--These boards are each 1 inch thick and 7 inches  wide. As the top of the table is 42 inches long, and we must provide an  overhang, say of 2 inches, we will first take off 4 inches for the  overhang and 4 inches for the legs, so that the length of two of the  facing boards, from shoulder to shoulder, must be 34 inches; and the  other two facing boards 28 inches. Then, as we must add 1-1/2 inches for  each tenon, two of the boards will be 37 inches long and two of them 31  inches long.    [Illustration: _Fig. 31._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 32._]    The illustration (Fig. 31) shows a board marked with the cross lines (B)  at each end for the end of the tenons, or the extreme ends of the  boards.    THE TENONS.--Do not neglect first to select the work side and the  working edge of the board. The outer surface and the upper edges are the  sides to work from. The cheekpiece (A) of the gage must always rest  against the working side.    The cross marks (B, C) should be made with the point of a sharp knife,  and before the small back saw is used on the cross-cuts the lines (B),  which indicate the shoulders, should be scored with a sharp knife, as  shown in Fig. 33. This furnishes a guide for the saw, and makes a neat  finish for the shoulder.    [Illustration: _Fig. 33._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 34._]    [Illusstration _Fig. 35._]    TOOLS USED.--The back saw is used for cutting the tenon, and the end of  the board appears as shown in the enlarged Fig. 34. Two things are now  necessary to complete the tenons. On the upper or work edge of each  board use the gage to mark off a half-inch slice, and then cut away the  flat side of the tenon at the end, on its inner surface, so it will  appear as shown in Fig. 35.    [Illustration: _Fig. 36._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 37._]    CHAMFERED TENONS.--The object of these chamfered or beveled tenons is to  permit the ends to approach each other closely within the mortise, as  shown in the assembled parts (Fig. 36).    THE FRAME ASSEMBLED.--The frame is now ready to assemble, but before  doing so a drawer opening and supports should be made. The ends of the  supports may be mortised into the side pieces or secured by means of  gains.    Mortises and tenons are better.    THE DRAWER SUPPORTS.--Take one of the side-facing boards (Fig. 37) and  cut a rectangular opening in it. This opening should be 4 inches wide  and 18 inches long, so placed that there is 1 inch of stock at the upper  margin and 2 inches of stock at the lower margin of the board. At each  lower corner make a mortise (A), so that one side of the mortise is on a  line with the margin of the opening, and so that it extends a half inch  past the vertical margin of the opening.    [Illustration: _Fig. 38._]    You can easily cut a gain (B) in a strip, or, as in Fig. 38, you may use  two strips, one (C) an inch wide and a half inch thick, and on this nail  a strip (D) along one margin. This forms the guide and rest for the  drawer.    At the upper margin of the opening is a rebate or gain (E) at each  corner, extending down to the top line of the drawer opening, into which  are fitted the ends of the upper cross guides.    THE TABLE FRAME.--When the entire table frame is assembled it will have  the appearance shown in Fig. 39, and it is now ready for the top.    THE TOP.--The top should be made of three boards, either tongued and  grooved, or doweled and glued together. In order to give a massive  appearance, and also to prevent the end grain of the boards from being  exposed, beveled strips may be used to encase the edges. These marginal  cleats are 3/4 inch thick and 2 inches wide, and joined by beveled ends  at the corners, as shown in Fig. 40.    [Illustration: _Fig. 39._]    THE DRAWER.--The drawer (Fig. 41) shown in cross section, has its front  (A) provided with an overlapping flange (B).    It is not our object in this chapter to show how each particular article  is made, but simply to point out the underlying principles, and to  illustrate how the fastening elements, the tenons and mortises, are  formed, so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20769"],[0,"A Field Book of the Stars (#8)"],[1,"lustration: MUSCA]          METEORIC SHOWERS.

Brilliant displays were seen in 1872 and 1885.    The Leonids are characterized by their exceedingly swift flight. They  are of a greenish or bluish tint and leave behind them a vivid and  persistent train. In most years the display is not especially  noteworthy. Once in thirty-three years they afford an exhibition grand  beyond description as in 1833 and 1866.          THE CONSTELLATIONS OF WINTER.    [Illustration: Map showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40[deg]  N. at 9 o'clock, January first.]          TAURUS (t[^a]'-rus)--THE BULL. (Face Southwest.)      LOCATION.--Taurus contains the well-known and unmistakable group the  Pleiades, on the right shoulder of the Bull. A \"V\" shaped group known  as the Hyades is just to the southeast of the Pleiades, in the face of  the Bull, forming one of the most beautiful objects in the sky.    The brightest star in Taurus is Aldebaran, a ruddy-hued star known as  \"The Follower.\" It is at the beginning of the \"V\" in the Hyades, and  is at the apex of a triangle formed by Capella, in Auriga, and [a]  Persei, and equally distant from them both.    The star [b] called Nath, is peculiarly white, and is common to Taurus  and Auriga. It represents the tip of one of the Bull's horns, and the  right foot of the Charioteer. The Pleiades are mentioned in Chinese  annals in 2357 B.C. On a photograph of the group over 2000 stars have  been counted.    The ecliptic passes a little south of a point midway between the two  horns, where a scattered and broken stream of minute stars can be  seen.    Note two pretty pairs in the Hyades, one south of Aldebaran, the other  northwest of it.    There are rich clusters below the tip of the horn over Orion's head.    Taurus was an important object of worship by the Druids.    Aldebaran is near one eye of the Bull, and used to be called \"The  Bull's Eye.\" An occultation of it by the moon, which not infrequently  occurs, is a striking phenomenon.    The Eskimos regard the Pleiades as a team of dogs in pursuit of a  bear. The group is receding from us at the rate of thirteen miles a  second and has a common eastward motion of about ten seconds a  century.    [Illustration: TAURUS]          ORION ([)o]-r[=i]'-on)--THE GIANT HUNTER. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--Orion is considered the finest constellation in the  heavens. A line drawn from Nath to [z] Tauri (the tips of the Bull's  horns), and extended 15[deg], strikes the brilliant Betelgeuze in Orion,  known as the martial star. It forms the northeast corner of a  conspicuous parallelogram. The splendid first-magnitude star Rigel is  diagonally opposite Betelgeuze, and the girdle and sword of the Hunter  lie within the parallelogram, a very striking group. The former is  represented by three bright stars in a line 3[deg] long known as the  \"Three Stars,\" because there are no other stars in the heavens that  exactly resemble them in position and brightness.    In the sword there is the most remarkable nebula in the heavens. It  may be seen with an opera-glass and in a telescope it is a wonderful  sight. Bellatrix is called the Amazon star. Note the contrasting  colours of [a] and [b].    About 9[deg] west of Bellatrix are eight stars in a curved line running  north and south. These point out the Lion's skin held in the Hunter's  left hand.    Below [l] there are two stars forming a triangle with it. Flammarion  calls this region the California of the sky.    The celestial equator passes nearly through [d].    Orion was worshipped in China during the one thousand years before our  era, and was known to the Chinese as the \"White Tiger.\"    The Eskimos see in the Belt stars the three steps cut by some  celestial Eskimo in a steep snow bank to enable him to reach the top.    [Illustration: ORION]          LEPUS (l[=e]'-pus)--THE HARE. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--Lepus crouches under Orion's feet. Four stars in the  constellation form an irregular and conspicuous quadrilateral.    [g] is a beautiful double of a greenish hue.    Four or five degrees south of Rigel are four faint stars which are in  the ear of the hare. They can be seen on a clear night with the naked  eye.    The curved line of three stars [th], [[^e]], and [z], are in the back of  the hare.    Lepus is about 18[deg] west of Canis Major, and, by reason of the earth's  motion, the Great Dog seems to be pursuing the Hare around the  heavens.    The first-magnitude stars that are visible in the winter season in  this latitude present a fine contrast in color. Even the untrained eye  can see a decided difference between the bluish white color of the  brilliant Sirius, the Dog star that the Belt stars point south to, and  Rigel, and the ruddy Betelgeuze. Procyon has a yellowish tinge and  resembles the condition of our sun, while Betelgeuze is surrounded by  heavy metallic vapors and is thought to be approaching extinction.    R marks the location of \"Hind's crimson star,\" a famous variable.    [Illustration: LEPUS]          COLUMBA NOACHI (co-lum'-b[:a] n[=o]-[:a]'-ki)--NOAH'S DOVE. (Face South.)
