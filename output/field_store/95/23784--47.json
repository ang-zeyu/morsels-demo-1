Paris, p. 498. See further, p. 578. M. West. p. 348.         ** M. Paris, p. 518, 558, 568. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 293.           *** M. Paris, p. 568.    \"It is true,\" replied the king, \"I have been somewhat faulty in this  particular: I obtruded you, my lord of Canterbury, upon your see; I was  obliged to employ both entreaties and menaces, my lord of Winchester,  to have, you elected; my proceedings, I confess, were very irregular,  my lords of Salisbury and Carlisle, when I raised you from the lowest  stations to your present dignities; I am determined henceforth to  correct these abuses; and it will also become you, in order to make a  thorough reformation, to resign your present benefices; and try to enter  again in a more regular and canonical manner.\"[*] The bishops, surprised  at these unexpected sarcasms, replied, that the question was not at  present how to correct past errors, but to avoid them for the future.  The king promised redress both of ecclesiastical and civil grievances;  and the parliament in return agreed to grant him a supply, a tenth  of the ecclesiastical benefices, and a scutage of three marks on  each knight's fee: but as they had experienced his frequent breach of  promise, they required that he should ratify the Great Charter in  a manner still more authentic and more solemn than any which he had  hitherto employed. All the prelates and abbots were assembled: they held  burning tapers in their hands: the Great Charter was read before them:  they denounced the sentence of excommunication against every one who  should thenceforth violate that fundamental law: they threw their tapers  on the ground, and exclaimed, \"May the soul of every one who incurs this  sentence so stink and corrupt in hell!\" The king bore a part in this  ceremony, and subjoined, \"So help me God, I will keep all these articles  inviolate, as I am a man, as I am a Christian, as I am a knight, and as  I am a king crowned and anointed.\"[**] Yet was the tremendous ceremony  no sooner finished, than his favorites, abusing his weakness, made  him return to the same arbitrary and irregular administration; and the  reasonable expectations of his people were thus perpetually eluded and  disappointed.[***]         * M. Paris, p. 579.         ** Ibid. p. 580. Ann. Burt. p. 323. Ann. Waverl. p. 210. W       Heming. p. 571. M. West. p. 353.         *** M.

This nobleman was a younger son of that Simon de  Mountfort who had conducted with such valor and renown the crusade  against the Albigenses, and who, though he tarnished his famous exploits  by cruelty and ambition, had left a name very precious to all the bigots  of that age, particularly to the ecclesiastics. A large inheritance  in England fell by succession to this family; but as the elder brother  enjoyed still more opulent possessions in France, and could not perform  fealty to two masters, he transferred his right to Simon, his younger  brother, who came over to England, did homage for his lands, and  was raised to the dignity of earl of Leicester. In the year 1238, he  espoused Eleanor, dowager of William, earl of Pembroke, and sister to  the king;[*] but the marriage of this princess with a subject and a  foreigner, though contracted with Henry's consent, was loudly complained  of by the earl of Cornwall and all the barons of England; and Leicester  was supported against their violence by the king's favor and authority  alone.[**] But he had no sooner established himself in his possessions  and dignities, than he acquired, by insinuation and address, a strong  interest with the nation, and gained equally the affections of all  orders of men. He lost, however, the friendship of Henry from the usual  levity and fickleness of that prince; he was banished the court; he was  recalled; he was intrusted with the command of Guienne,[***] where he  did good service and acquired honor; he was again disgraced by the king,  and his banishment from court seemed now final and irrevocable. Henry  called him traiter to his face; Leicester gave him the lie, and told  him that, if he were not his sovereign, he would soon make him repent  of that insult. Yet was this quarrel accommodated, either from the good  nature or timidity of the king, and Leicester was again admitted into  some degree of favor and authority. But as this nobleman was become too  great to preserve an entire complaisance to Henry's humors, and to  act in subserviency to his other minions, he found more advantage in  cultivating his interest with the public, and in inflaming the general  discontents which prevailed against the administration. He filled every  place with complaints against the infringement of the Great Charter, the  acts of violence committed on the people, the combination between the  pope and the king in their tyranny and extortions, Henry's neglect of  his native subjects and barons; and though himself a foreigner, he was  more loud than any in representing the indignity of submitting to the  dominion of foreigners.         * M. Paris, p. 314.         ** Ibid, p. 315.         *** Rymer, vol. i. p. 459, 513.    By his hypocritical pretensions to devotion he gained the favor of the  zealots and clergy: by his seeming concern for public good he acquired  the affections of the public: and besides the private friendships which  he had cultivated with the barons, his animosity against the favorites  created a union of interests between him and that powerful order.    A recent quarrel which broke out between Leicester and William de  Valence, Henry's half brother and chief favorite, brought matters to  extremity,[*] and determined the former to give full scope to his bold  and unbounded ambition, which the laws and the king's authority had  hitherto with difficulty restrained. He secretly called a meeting of  the most considerable barons, particularly Humphrey de Bohun, high  constable, Roger Bigod, earl mareschal, and the earls of Warwick and  Glocester; men who by their family and possessions stood in the first  rank of the English nobility. He represented to this company the  necessity of reforming the state, and of putting the execution of the  laws into other hands than those which had hitherto appeared, from  repeated experience, so unfit for the charge with which they were  intrusted. He exaggerated the oppressions exercised against the lower  orders of the state, the violations of the barons' privileges, the  continued depredations made on the clergy; and in order to aggravate the  enormity of this conduct, he appealed to the Great Charter, which Henry  had so often ratified, and which was calculated to prevent forever the  return of those intolerable grievances. He magnified the generosity of  their ancestors, who, at a great expense of blood, had extorted that  famous concession from the crown; but lamented their own degeneracy,  who allowed so important an advantage, once obtained, to be wrested from  them by a weak prince and by insolent strangers. And he insisted that  the king's word, after so many submissions and fruitless promises on his  part, could no longer be relied on; and that nothing but his absolute  inability to violate national privileges could henceforth insure the  regular observance of them.         * M. Paris, p. 649.    These topics, which were founded in truth, and suited so well the  sentiments of the company, had the desired effect, and the barons  embraced a resolution of redressing the public grievances, by taking  into their own hands the administration of government. Henry having  summoned a parliament, in expectation of receiving supplies for his  Sicilian project, the barons appeared in the hall, clad in complete  armor, and with their swords by their side: the king, on his entry,  struck with the unusual appearance, asked them what was their purpose,  and whether they pretended to make him their prisoner.[*] Roger Bigod  replied in the name of the rest, that he was not their prisoner, but  their sovereign; that they even intended to grant him large supplies,  in order to fix his son on the throne of Sicily; that they only expected  some return for this expense and service; and that, as he had frequently  made submissions to the parliament, had acknowledged his past errors,  and had still allowed himself to be carried into the same path, which  gave them such just reason of complaint, he must now yield to more  strict regulations, and confer authority on those who were able and  willing to redress the national grievances. Henry, partly allured by the  hopes of supply, partly intimidated by the union and martial appearance  of the barons, agreed to their demand, and promised to summon another  parliament at Oxford, in order to digest the new plan of government, and  to elect the persons who were to be intrusted with the chief authority.    This parliament, which the royalists, and even the nation, from  experience of the confusions that attended its measures, afterwards  denominated the \"mad parliament,\" met on the day appointed; and as all  the barons brought along with them their military vassals, and appeared  with an armed force, the king, who had taken no precautions against  them, was in reality a prisoner in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#8)"],[1,"he succeeded in the attempt. The rebels were dissipated; John  Achamber was taken prisoner, and afterwards executed with some of his  accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled to the duchess of Burgundy, who gave  him protection; the greater number of the rebels received a pardon.    Henry had probably expected, when he obtained this grant from  parliament, that he should be able to terminate the affair of Brittany  by negotiation, and that he might thereby fill his coffers with the  money levied by the imposition. But as the distresses of the Bretons  still multiplied, and became every day more urgent, he found himself  under the necessity of taking more vigorous measures, in order to  support them. On the death of the duke, the French had revived some  antiquated claims to the dominion of the duchy; and as the duke of  Orleans was now captive in France, their former pretence for hostilities  could no longer serve as a cover to their ambition. The king resolved  therefore to engage as auxiliary to Brittany; and to consult the  interests, as well as desires of his people, by opposing himself to  the progress of the French power. Besides entering into a league with  Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which were distant resources,  he levied a body of troops, to the number of six thousand men, with an  intention of transporting them into Brittany.    {1489.} Still anxious, however, for the repayment of his expenses, he  concluded a treaty with the young duchess, by which she engaged to  deliver into his hands two seaport towns, there to remain till she  should entirely refund the charges of the armament.[*]         * Du Tillet, Recueil des Traites.    Though he engaged for the service of these troops during the space of  ten months only, yet was the duchess obliged, by the necessity of her  affairs, to submit to such rigid conditions, imposed by any ally so  much concerned in interest to protect her. The forces arrived under the  command of Lord Willoughby of Broke; and made the Bretons, during some  time, masters of the field. The French retired into their garrisons;  and expected by dilatory measures to waste the fire of the English, and  disgust them with the enterprise. The scheme was well laid, and met with  success. Lord Broke found such discord and confusion in the counsels of  Brittany, that no measures could be concerted for any undertaking; no  supply obtained; no provisions, carriages, artillery, or military stores  procured. The whole court was rent into factions: no one minister had  acquired the ascendant: and whatever project was formed by one, was  sure to be traversed by another. The English, disconcerted in every  enterprise by these animosities and uncertain counsels, returned home  as soon as the time of their service was elapsed, leaving only a small  garrison in those towns which had been consigned into their hands.  During their stay in Brittany, they had only contributed still further  to waste the country; and by their departure, they left it entirely at  the mercy of the enemy. So feeble was the succor which Henry in this  important conjuncture afforded his ally, whom the invasion of a foreign  enemy, concurring with domestic dissensions, had reduced to the utmost  distress.    The great object of the domestic dissensions in Brittany was the  disposal of the young duchess in marriage. The mareschal Rieux, favored  by Henry, seconded the suit of the lord D'Albret, who led some forces to  her assistance. The chancellor Montauban, observing the aversion of the  duchess to this suitor, insisted that a petty prince, such as  D'Albret, was unable to support Anne in her present extremities; and  he recommended some more powerful alliance, particularly that of  Maximilian, king of the Romans.    {1490.} This party at last prevailed; the marriage with Maximilian was  celebrated by proxy; and the duchess thenceforth assumed the title of  queen of the Romans. But this magnificent appellation was all she  gained by her marriage. Maximilian, destitute of troops and money, and  embarrassed with the continual revolts of the Flemings, could send  no succor to his distressed consort; while D'Albret, enraged at the  preference given to his rival, deserted her cause, and received the  French into Nantz, the most important place in the duchy both for  strength and riches.    The French court now began to change their scheme with regard to the  subjection of Brittany. Charles had formerly been affianced to Margaret,  daughter of Maximilian; who, though too young for the consummation of  her marriage, had been sent to Paris to be educated, and at this time  bore the title of queen of France. Besides the rich dowry which she  brought the king, she was, after her brother Philip, then in early  youth, heir to all the dominions of the house of Burgundy; and seemed in  many respects the most proper match that could be chosen for the young  monarch. These circumstances had so blinded both Maximilian and Henry,  that they never suspected any other intentions in the French court; nor  were they able to discover that engagements, seemingly so advantageous  and so solemnly entered into, could be infringed and set aside. But  Charles began to perceive that the conquest of Brittany, in opposition  to the natives, and to all the great powers of Christendom, would prove  a difficult enterprise; and that even if he should overrun the country  and make himself master of the fortresses, it would be impossible for  him long to retain possession of them. The marriage alone of the duchess  could fully reannex that fief to the crown; and the present and certain  enjoyment of so considerable a territory, seemed preferable to the  prospect of inheriting the dominions of the house of Burgundy; a  prospect which became every day more distant and precarious. Above all,  the marriage of Maximilian and Anne appeared destructive to the grandeur  and even security of the French monarchy; while that prince, possessing  Flanders on the one hand, and Brittany on the other, might thus, from  both quarters, make inroads into the heart of the country. The only  remedy for these evils was therefore concluded to be the dissolution of  the two marriages, which had been celebrated, but not consummated; and  the espousal of the duchess of Brittany by the king of France.    It was necessary that this expedient, which had not been foreseen by any  court in Europe, and which they were all so much interested to oppose,  should be kept a profound secret, and should be discovered to the  world only by the full execution of it. The measures of the French  ministry in the conduct of this delicate enterprise were wise and  political. While they pressed Brittany with all the rigors of war, they  secretly gained the count of Dunois, who possessed great authority with  the Bretons; and having also engaged in their interests the prince of  Orange, cousin-german to the duchess, they gave him his liberty, and  sent him into Brittany. These partisans, supported by other emissaries  of France, prepared the minds of men for the great revolution projected,  and displayed, though still with many precautions, all the advantages  of a union with the French monarchy. They represented to the barons  of Brittany, that their country, harassed during so many years with  perpetual war, had need of some repose, and of a solid and lasting peace  with the only power that was formidable to them: that their alliance  with Maximilian was not able to afford them even present protection;  and, by closely uniting them to a power which was rival to the greatness  of France, fixed them in perpetual enmity with that potent monarchy:  that their vicinity exposed them first to the inroads of the enemy; and  the happiest event which, in such a situation, could befall them, would  be to attain a peace, though by a final subjection to France, and by the  loss of that liberty transmitted to them from their ancestors: and that  any other expedient, compatible with the honor of the state and their  duty to their sovereign, was preferable to a scene of such disorder and  devastation.    These suggestions had influence with the Bretons: but the chief  difficulty lay in surmounting the prejudices of the young duchess  herself. That princess had imbibed a strong prepossession against the  French nation, particularly against Charles, the author of all the  calamities which, from her earliest infancy, had befallen her family.  She had also fixed her affections on Maximilian; and as she now deemed  him her husband, she could not, she thought, without incurring the  greatest guilt, and violating the most solemn engagements, contract a  marriage with any other person.    {1491.} In order to overcome her obstinacy, Charles gave the duke of  Orleans his liberty; who, though formerly a suitor to the duchess, was  now contented to ingratiate himself with the king, by employing in his  favor all the interest which he still possessed in Brittany. Mareschal  Rieux and Chancellor Montauban were reconciled by his mediation; and  these rival ministers now concurred with the prince of Orange and the  count of Dunois, in pressing the conclusion of a marriage with Charles.  By their suggestion, Charles advanced with a powerful army, and invested  Rennes, at that time the residence of the duchess; who, assailed on all  hands, and finding none to support her in her inflexibility, at last  opened the gates of the city, and agreed to espouse the king of France,  She was married at Langey, in Touraine; conducted to St. Denis, where  she was crowned; thence made her entry into Paris, amidst the joyful  acclamations of the people, who regarded this marriage as the most  prosperous event that could have befallen the monarchy.    The triumph and success of Charles was the most sensible mortification  to the king of the Romans. He had lost a considerable territory, which  he thought he had acquired, and an accomplished"]]]
