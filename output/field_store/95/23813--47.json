The Cheroos and Kharwars, Parheyas, Kisans, Bhuikers, Boyars,  Nagbansis, Kaurs, Mars, Bhunyiars, Bendkars form another great group  apart from the Kolarians and Dravidians, and approximating more to  the Indian variety of the Japetic class.    Then there are the extremely low types which one has no hesitation  in assigning to the lowest form of the Polynesian group, such as the  Andamanese, the jungle tree-men of Chittagong, Tipperah, and the  vast forests stretching towards Sambhulpur.    On these I would now more particularly dwell as points of comparison  with the rest of the animal kingdom. I have taken but a superficial  view of the varieties of the higher types of the human race in India,  for the subject, if thoroughly entered into, would require a volume  of no ordinary dimensions; and those who wish to pursue the study  further should read an able paper by Sir George Campbell in the  'Journal of the Asiatic Society' for June 1866 (vol. xxxv. Part II.),  Colonel Dalton's 'Ethnology of Bengal,' the Rev. S. Hislop's  'Memoranda,' and the 'Report of the Central Provinces Ethnological  Committee.' There is as yet, however, very little reliable  information regarding the wilder forms of humanity inhabiting dense  forests, where, enjoying apparently complete immunity from the  deadly malaria that proves fatal to all others, they live a life but  a few degrees removed from the Quadrumana.    I have in my book on the Seonee District described the little colonies  in the heart of the Bison jungles. Clusters of huts imbedded in  tangled masses of foliage, surrounded by an atmosphere reeking with  the effluvia of decaying vegetation, where, unheedful of the great  outer world beyond their sylvan limits, the Gonds pass year after  year of uneventful lives.    In some of these hamlets I was looked upon with positive awe, as being  the first white man the _Baigas_ had seen. But these simple savages  rank high in the scale compared with some others, of whom we have  as yet but imperfect descriptions.    Some years ago Mr. Piddington communicated to the Asiatic Society  an account of some \"Monkey-men\" he came across on the borders of the  Palamow jungle. He was in the habit of employing the aboriginal  tribes to work for him, and on one occasion a party of his men found  in the jungle a man and woman in a state of starvation, and brought  them in. They were both very short in stature, with disproportionately  long arms, which in the man were covered with a reddish-brown hair.  They looked almost more like baboons than human beings, and their  language was unintelligible, except that words here and there  resembled those in one of the Kolarian dialects. By signs, and by the  help of these words, one of the Dhangars managed to make out that they  lived in the depths of the forest, but had to fly from their people on  account of a blood feud. Mr. Piddington was anxious to send them down  to Calcutta, but before he could do so, they decamped one night, and  fled again to their native wilds. Those jungles are, I believe, still  in a great measure unexplored; and, if some day they are opened out,  it is to be hoped that the \"Monkey-men\" will be again discovered.[1]    [Footnote 1: There has been lately exhibited in London a child from  Borneo which has several points in common with the monkey--hairy face  and arms, the hair on the fore-arm being reversed, as in the apes.]    The lowest type with which we are familiar is the Andamanese, and  the wilder sort of these will hardly bear comparison with even the  degraded Australian or African Bosjesman, and approximate in  debasement to the Fuegians.    The Andamanese are small in stature--the men averaging about five  feet, the women less. They are very dark, I may say black, but here  the resemblance to the Negro ceases. They have not the thick lips  and flat nose, nor the peculiar heel of the Negro. In habit they are  in small degree above the brutes, architecture and agriculture being  unknown. The only arts they are masters of are limited to the  manufacture of weapons, such as spears, bows and arrows, and canoes.  They wear no kind of dress, but, when flies and mosquitoes are  troublesome, plaster themselves with mud. The women are fond of  painting themselves with red ochre, which they lay thickly over their  heads, after scraping off the hair with a flint-knife. They swim and  dive like ducks, and run up trees like monkeys. Though affectionate  to their children, they are ruthless to the stranger, killing every  one who happens to be cast away on their inhospitable shores. They  have been accused of cannibalism, but this is open to doubt. The  bodies of those they have killed have been found dreadfully mutilated,  almost pounded to a jelly, but no portion had been removed.[2]    [Footnote 2: Since the above was written there has been published  in the 'Journal of the Anthropological Institute,' vol. xii., a most  interesting and exhaustive paper on these people by Mr. E. H. Man,  F.R.G.S., giving them credit for much intelligence.]    In the above description I speak of the savage Andamanese in his wild  state, and not of the specimens to be seen at Port Blair, who have  become in an infinitesimal degree civilised--that is to say, to the  extent of holding intercourse with foreigners, making some slight  additions to their argillaceous dress-suits, and understanding the  principles of exchange and barter--though as regards this last a  friend informs me that they have no notion of a token currency, but  only understand the _argumentum ad hominem_ in the shape of  comestibles, so that your bargains, to be effectual, must be made  within reach of a cookshop or grocery. The same friend tells me he  learnt at Port Blair that there were marriage restrictions on which  great stress was laid. This may be the case on the South Island; there  is much testimony on the other side as regards the more savage  Andamanese.    The forest tribes of Chittagong are much higher in the scale than  the Andamanese, but they are nevertheless savages of a low type.  Captain Lewin says: \"The men wear scarcely any clothing, and the  petticoat of the women is scanty, reaching only to the knee; they  worship the terrene elements, and have vague and undefined ideas of  some divine power which overshadows all. They were born and they die  for ends to them as incomputable as the path of a cannon-shot fired  into the darkness. They are cruel, and attach but little value to  life. Reverence or respect are emotions unknown to them, they salute  neither their chiefs nor their elders, neither have they any  expression conveying thanks.\" There is, however, much that is  interesting in these wild people, and to those who wish to know more  I recommend Captain Lewin's account of 'The Hill Tracts of Chittagong.'          ORDER QUADRUMANA.      The monkeys of the Indian Peninsula are restricted to a few groups,  of which the principal one is that of the _Semnopitheci_. These  monkeys are distinguished not only by their peculiar black faces,  with a ridge of long stiff black hair projecting forwards over the  eyebrows, thin slim bodies and long tails, but by the absence of cheek  pouches, and the possession of a peculiar sacculated stomach, which,  as figured in Cuvier, resembles a bunch of grapes. Jerdon says of  this group that, out of five species found on the continent there  is only one spread through all the plains of Central and Northern  India, and one through the Himalayas, whilst there are three  well-marked species in the extreme south of the Peninsula; but then  he omits at least four species inhabiting Chittagong, Tenasserim,  Arracan, which also belong to the continent of India, though perhaps  not to the actual Peninsula. Sir Emerson Tennent, in his 'Natural  History of Ceylon,' also mentions and figures three species, of which  two are not included in Jerdon's 'Mammals,' though incidentally  spoken of. I propose to add the Ceylon Mammalia to the Indian, and  therefore shall allude to these further on.    The next group of Indian monkeys is that of the Macaques or Magots,  or Monkey Baboons of India, the _Lal Bundar_ of the natives. They  have simple stomachs and cheek pouches, which last, I dare say, most  of us have noticed who have happened to give two plantains in  succession to one of them.    Although numerically the _Langurs_ or Entellus Monkeys form the most  important group of the Quadrumana in India, yet the Gibbons (which  are not included by Jerdon) rank highest in the scale, though the  species are restricted to but three--_Hylobates hooluck_, _H. lar_  and _H. syndactylus_. They are superior in formation (that is taking  man as the highest development of the form, to which some people take  objection, though to my way of thinking there is not much to choose  between the highest type of monkey and the lowest of humanity, if  we would but look facts straight in the face), and they are also  vastly superior in intellect to either the _Langurs_ or the  _Macaques_, though inferior perhaps to the Ourangs.      _GENUS HYLOBATES--THE GIBBONS_,    Which, with the long arms of the Ourangs and the receding forehead  of the Chimpanzee, possess the callosities of the true monkeys, but  differ from them in having neither tail nor cheek pouches. They are  true bipeds on the ground, applying the sole of the foot flatly, not,  as Cuvier and others have remarked of the Ourangs, with the outer  edge of the sole only, but flat down, as Blyth, who first mentions  it, noticed it, with the thumb or big toe widely separated.      NO. 1. HYLOBATES HOOLUCK.  _The White-fronted Gibbon_.    NATIVE NAMES.--_Hooluck_, _Hookoo_.    HABITAT.--Garo and Khasia Hills, Valley of Assam, and Arracan.

THE ASSEMBLY      Being deployed: 1. Assemble, 2. MARCH.    The men move toward the corporal and form in their proper places.    If the corporal continues to advance, the men move in double time, form,  and follow him.    The assembly while marching to the rear is not executed.         Note. It will be better for the beginner to let the remainder of       this chapter go for awhile. Your instructor will explain all of the       following points in a way that will be easier for you than for you       to try to work them out alone. They will come up in the first       month's work and will be explained and shown as you go along. As       you become more proficient we advise you, then, to take up the       remainder of the chapter.    If standing: KNEEL.    Half face to the right; carry the right toe about 1 foot to the left  rear of the left heel; kneel on the right knee, sitting as nearly as  possible on the right heel; left forearm across left thigh; piece  remains in position of order arms, right hand grasping it above the  lower hand.    If standing or kneeling: LIE DOWN.    Kneel, but with right knee against left heel; carry back the left foot  and lie flat on the belly, inclining body about 35 degrees to the  right; piece horizontal, barrel up, muzzle off the ground and pointed to  the front; elbows on the ground; left hand at the balance, right hand  grasping the small of the stock opposite the neck. This is the position  of order arms, lying down.    If kneeling or lying down: RISE.    If kneeling, stand up, faced to the front, on the ground marked by the  left heel.    If lying down, raise body on both knees; stand up, faced to the front,  on the ground marked by the knees.    If lying down: KNEEL.    Raise the body on both knees; take the position of kneel.    In double rank, the positions of kneeling and lying down are ordinarily  used only for the better utilization of cover.    When deployed as skirmishers, a sitting position may be taken in lieu of  the kneeling position.        LOADINGS AND FIRINGS      The commands for loading and firing are the same whether standing,  kneeling, or lying down. The firings are always executed at a halt.    When kneeling or lying down in double rank, the rear rank does not load,  aim, or fire.    The instruction in firing will be preceded by a command for loading.    Loadings are executed in line and skirmish line only.    Pieces, having been ordered loaded, are kept loaded without command  until the command unload, or inspection arms, fresh clips being  inserted when the magazine is exhausted.    The aiming point or target is carefully pointed out. This may be done  before or after announcing the sight setting. Both are indicated before  giving the command for firing, but may be omitted when the target  appears suddenly and is unmistakable; in such case battle sight is used  if no sight setting is announced.    The target or aiming point having been designated and the sight setting  announced, such designation or announcement need not be repeated until a  change of either or both is necessary.    Troops are trained to continue their fire upon the aiming point or  target designated, and at the sight setting announced, until a change is  ordered.    If the men are not already in the position of load, that position is  taken at the announcement of the sight setting; if the announcement is  omitted, the position is taken at the first command for firing.    When deployed, the use of the sling as an aid to accurate firing is  discretionary with each man.        TO LOAD      Being in line or skirmish line at halt: 1. With dummy (blank or ball)  cartridges, 2. LOAD.    At the command load each front-rank man or skirmisher faces half right  and carries the right foot to the right, about 1 foot, to such position  as will insure the greatest firmness and steadiness of the body;  raises, or lowers, the piece and drops it into the left hand at the  balance, left thumb extended along the stock, muzzle at the height of  the breast, and turns the cut-off up. With the right hand, he turns and  draws the bolt back, takes a loaded clip and inserts the end in the clip  slots, places the thumb on the powder space of the top cartridge, the  fingers extending around the piece and tips resting on the magazine  floor plate; forces the cartridges into the magazine by pressing down  with the thumb; without removing the clip, thrusts the bolt home,  turning down the handle; turns the safety lock to the \"safe\" and carries  the hand to the small of the stock. Each rear rank man moves to the  right front, takes a similar position opposite the interval to the right  of his front rank man, muzzle of the piece extending beyond the front  rank, and loads.    A skirmish line may load while moving, the pieces being held as neatly  as practicable in the position of load.    If kneeling or sitting, the position of the piece is similar; if  kneeling, the left forearm rests on the left thigh; if sitting the  elbows are supported by the knees; if lying down, the left hand steadies  and supports the piece at the balance, the toe of the butt resting on  the ground, the muzzle off the ground.        STACK AND TAKE ARMS      The subject of stack and take arms is less important than the rest of  this chapter. It is difficult to be learned from a book. Your company  commander will explain it to you. It is given here to serve as a  reference.    Being in line at a halt: STACK ARMS.    Each even number of the front rank grasps his piece with the left hand  at the upper band and rests the butt between his feet, barrel to the  front, muzzle inclined slightly to the front and opposite the center of  the interval on his right, the thumb and forefinger raising the stacking  swivel; each even number of the rear rank then passes his piece, barrel  to the rear, to his file leader, who grasps it between the bands with  his right hand and throws the butt about two feet in advance of that of  his own piece and opposite the right of the interval, the right hand  slipping to the upper band, the thumb and forefinger raising the  stacking swivel, which he engages with that of his own piece; each odd  number of the front rank raises his piece with the right hand, carries  it well forward, barrel to the front; the left hand, guiding the  stacking swivel, engages the lower hook of the swivel of his own piece  with the free hook of that of the even number of the rear rank; he then  turns the barrel outward into the angle formed by the other two pieces  and lowers the butt to the ground, to the right of and against the toe  of his right shoe.    The stacks made, the loose pieces are laid on them by the even numbers  of the front rank.    When each man has finished handling pieces, he takes the position of the  soldier.    Being in line behind the stacks: TAKE ARMS.    The loose pieces are returned by the even numbers of the front rank;  each even number of the front rank grasps his own piece with the left  hand, the piece of his rear-rank man with his right hand, grasping both  between the bands; each odd number of the front rank grasps his piece in  the same way with the right hand, disengages it by raising the butt from  the ground and then, turning the piece to the right, detaches it from  the stack; each even number of the front rank disengages and detaches  his piece by turning it to the left, and then passes the piece of his  rear-rank man to him, and all resume the order.    Should any squad have Nos. 2 and 3 blank files, No. 1 rear rank takes  the place of No. 2 rear rank in making and breaking the stack; the  stacks made or broken, he resumes his post.    Pieces not used in making the stack are termed loose pieces.    Pieces are never stacked with the bayonet fixed.          CHAPTER V    SCHOOL OF THE COMPANY    Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations      The company in line is formed in double rank with the men arranged, as  far as practicable, according to height from right to left, the tallest  on the right.    The original division into squads is effected by the command: Count off.  The squads, successively from the right, count off as in the School of  the Squad, corporals placing themselves as No. 4 of the front rank.    At the formation of the company the platoons or squads are numbered  consecutively from right to left, and these designations do not change.    For convenience in giving commands and for reference, the designations,  right, center, left, when in line, and leading, center, rear, when  in column, are applied to platoons or squads. These designations,  right, center, left, when in line, and leading, center, rear, when  in column, are applied to the actual right, left, center, head, or rear,  in whatever direction the company may be facing. The center squad is  the middle or right middle squad of the company. If there are an even  number of squads in the company, for instance eight, the center squad  would be the fourth.    The designation \"So-and-so's\" squad or platoon may also be used.    [Illustration: This is exactly the same as the photograph. It  shows the correct position of every man in the company. man for man.]    During battle, these assignments are not changed; vacancies are filled  by non-commissioned officers of the platoon, or by the nearest available  officers or non-commissioned officers arriving with reinforcing troops.        CLOSE ORDER      In column of squads, each rank preserves the alignment toward the side  of the guide.    Men in the line of file closers do not execute loadings and firings.        TO FORM THE COMPANY      At the sounding of the assembly the first sergeant takes position 6  paces in front of where the center of the company is to be, faces it,  draws saber, and commands: Fall in.    The right guide of the company places himself, facing to the front,  where the right of the company is to rest, and at such point that the  center of the company"]]]
