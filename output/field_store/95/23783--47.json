No amount of bribery  will secure a meal in less than two hours. Ten years ago there was not a  posada in the country; now there is entertainment for man and beast at  Guayaquil, Guaranda, Mocha, Ambato, Tacunga, Machachi, and Quito.  Riobamba has a billiard saloon, but no inn.    Leaving Ambato, we breakfasted at Cunchebamba, an Indian village of half  a dozen straw huts. Thence the road for a long distance winds through  vast deposits of volcanic _debris_, the only sign of vegetation being  hedges of aloe and cactus. Arid hills and dreary plains, covered with  plutonic rocks and pumice dust, tell us we are approaching the most  terrible volcano on the earth. Crossing the sources of the Pastassa, we  entered Latacunga,[16] situated on a beautiful plain at the foot of  Cotopaxi, seven hundred feet higher than Ambato. Its average temperature  is 59 deg.. The population, chiefly Indians, numbers about fifteen thousand.  It is the dullest city in Ecuador, without the show of enterprise or  business. Not even grass grows in the streets--the usual sign of life in  the Spanish towns. It is also one of the filthiest; and though it has  been many times thoroughly shaken by earthquakes, and buried under  showers of volcanic dust, it is still the paradise of fleas, which have  survived every revolution. Ida Pfeiffer says that, after a night's rest  in Latacunga, she awoke with her skin marked all over with red spots, as  if from an eruptive disease. We can certify that we have been tattoed  without the night's rest. The town has a most stupid and forlorn aspect.  Half of it is in ruins. It was four times destroyed between 1698 and  1797. In 1756 the Jesuit church was thrown down, though its walls were  five feet thick. The houses are of one story, and built of pumice,  widely different from the palaces and temples which are said to have  stood here in the palmy days of the Incas. Cotopaxi stands threateningly  near, and its rumbling thunder is the source of constant alarm.    [Footnote 16: This is shortened in parlance to Tacunga. The full name,  according to La Condamine, is _Llacta-cunga_, _llacta_ meaning country,  and _cunga_, neck.]    From Latacunga to Quito there is a very fine carriage road, the result  of one man's administration--Senor G. Garcia Moreno. For many miles it  passes over an uncultivated plateau, strewn with volcanic fragments. The  farms are confined to the slopes of the Cordilleras, and, as every where  else, the tumbling haciendas indicate the increasing poverty of the  owner. Superstition and indolence go hand in hand. On a great rock  rising out of the sandy plain they show a print of the foot of St.  Bartholomew, who alighted here on a visit--surely to the volcanoes, as  it was long before the red man had found this valley. Abreast of  Cotopaxi the road cuts through high hills of fine pumice  inter-stratified with black earth, and rapidly ascends till it reaches  Tiupullo, eleven thousand five hundred feet above the sea. This high  ridge,[17] stretching across the valley from Cotopaxi to Iliniza, is a  part of the great water-shed of the continent--the waters on the  southern slope flowing through the Pastassa and Amazon to the Atlantic,  those on the north finding their way to the Pacific by the Rio  Esmeraldas. At this bleak place we breakfasted on punch and guinea-pig.    [Footnote 17: Sometimes called _Chisinche_.]    As soon as we began to descend, the glittering cone of Cotopaxi, and the  gloomy plain it has so often devastated, passed out of view, and before  us was a green valley exceedingly rich and well cultivated, girt by a  wall of mountains, the towers of which were the peaks of Corazon and  Ruminagui. Loathsome lepers by the wayside alone disturbed the pleasing  impression. Three hours more of travel brought us to the straggling  village of Machachi, standing in the centre of the beautiful plain, at  an altitude of nine thousand nine hundred feet. Nature designed this  spot for a home of plenty and comfort, but the habitations of the  wretched proprietors are windowless adobe hovels, thatched with dried  grass, and notorious for their filth.    We must needs make one more ascent, for the ridge of Tambillo hides the  goal of our journey. The moment we reached the summit, views  unparalleled in the Andes or any where else met our astonished vision  whithersoever we looked. Far away to the south stretched the two  Cordilleras, till they were lost in the mist which enshrouded Chimborazo  and Tunguragua. Turning to the north, we beheld the city of Quito at our  feet, and Pichincha and Antisana standing like gallant sentinels on  either side of the proud capital. Beautiful were the towering mountains,  and almost as delightful now are the memories of that hour. A broad,  well-traveled road, gentlemen on horseback clad in rich ponchos, droves  of Indians bowed under their heavy burdens, and long lines of laden  donkeys hurrying to and fro, indicate our approach to a great city.  Winding with the road through green pastures and fields of ripening  grain, and crossing the Machangara by an elegant bridge, we enter the  city of the Incas.          CHAPTER III.         Early History of Quito.--Its Splendor under the Incas.--Crushed by       Spain.--Dying now.--Situation.--Altitude.--Streets.--Buildings.      Quito is better known than Ecuador. Its primeval history, however, is  lost in obscurity. In the language of Prescott, \"the mists of fable have  settled as darkly round its history as round that of any nation, ancient  or modern, in the Old World.\" Founded, nobody knows when, by the kings  of the Quitus, it was conquered about the year 1000 by a more civilized  race, the Cara nation, who added to it by conquest and alliance. The  fame of the region excited the cupidity of the Incas of Peru, and during  the reign of Cacha (1475), Huayna-Capac the Great moved his army from  Cuzco, and by the celebrated battle of Hatuntaqui, in which Cacha was  killed, Quito was added to the realm of the Incas. Huayna-Capac made  Quito his residence, and reigned there thirty-eight years--the most  brilliant epoch in the annals of the city. At his death his kingdom was  divided, one son, Atahuallpa,[18] reigning in Quito, and Huascar at  Cuzco. Civil war ensued, in which the latter was defeated, and  Atahuallpa was chosen Inca of the whole empire, 1532. During this war  Pizarro arrived at Tumbez. Every body knows what followed. Strangled at  Caxamarca, the body of Atahuallpa was carried to Quito, the city of his  birth, in compliance with his dying wish, and buried there with imposing  obsequies. Refounded by Benalcazar in 1534, Quito was created an  imperial city by Charles V. seven years later. It formed part of Peru  till 1710; then of Santa Fe till 1722; and again of Peru till its  independence. The power of Spain in South America was destroyed at the  battle of Ayacucho, Dec. 9, 1824. In 1830 Venezuela separated from  Colombia, and Ecuador followed the same year. The first Congress was  held in Riobamba; but Quito has ever since been the political focus. The  first president was General Flores.    [Footnote 18: The son of his Quito love. The name was first written  _Atauhuallpa_, meaning fortunate in war; after the fratricide, he was  called _Atahuallpa_, or game-cock. He was the Boabdil of this occidental  Granada. He is called traitor by Peruvian writers, and is not admitted  by them into the list of their Incas.]    Under the diadem of the Incas, Quito assumed a magnificence which it  never saw before and has not displayed since. It was the worthy  metropolis of a vast empire stretching from the equator to the desert of  Atacama, and walled in by the grandest group of mountains in the world.  On this lofty site, which amid the Alps would be buried in an avalanche  of snow, but within the tropics enjoys an eternal spring, palaces more  beautiful than the Alhambra were erected, glittering with the gold and  emerald of the Andes. But all this splendor passed away with the sceptre  of Atahuallpa. Where the pavilion of the Inca stood is now a gloomy  convent, and a wheat-field takes the place of the Temple of the Sun.    The colonial history of this favored spot is as lifeless as the history  of Sahara. Not a single event occurred of which even Spain can be proud;  not a monument was raised which reflects any credit upon the mother  country. Every thing was prescribed by law, and all law emanated from a  tribunal five thousand miles distant. There was no relation of private  life with which the government did not interfere: what the colonist  should plant and what trade he should follow; where he should buy and  where he should sell; how much he should import and export; and where  and when he should marry, were regulated by the \"Council of the Indies\"  and the Inquisition. In the words of a native writer, \"The great  majority of the people knew nothing of sciences, events, or men. Their  religion consisted of outward observances, and an imperfect knowledge of  the papal bulls; their morality, in asceticism and devotion to their  king; their philosophy, in the subtleties of Aristotle; their history,  in the history of the mother country; their geography, in the maps of  Spanish America and of Spain; their press, in what sufficed to print  bill-heads and blank forms; their commerce, in an insignificant coasting  trade; their ambition and highest aspirations, in titles of nobility;  their amusements, in bull-fights. The arrival of a mail was an event of  great moment, and with ringing of bells was received the _cajon de  Espana_ which announced the health of the sovereigns. Thus, while Europe  was passing through the stormy times of Louis XIV.; while the  philosophical writings of the illustrious men of those times found their  way into the remotest corners of the globe; while the English colonies  of North America conquered their independence; while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19211"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part A.

Britt. p. 324,325.]    Hengist, however, notwithstanding their opposition, still maintained his  ground in Britain and in order to divide the forces and attention of the  natives he called over a new tribe of Saxons, under the command of his  brother Octa, and of Ebissa, the son of Octa; and he settled them in  Northumberland. He himself remained in the southern parts of the island,  and laid the foundation of their kingdom of Kent, comprehending the  county of that name Middlesex, Essex, and part of Surrey. He fixed his  royal seat at Canterbury, where he governed about forty years, and he  died in or near the year 488, leaving his new-acquired dominions to his  posterity.    The success of Hengist excited the avidity of the other northern  Germans; and at different times, and under different leaders, they  flocked over in multitudes to the invasion of mis island. These  conquerors were chiefly composed of three tribes, the Saxons, Angles,  and Jutes,[*] who all passed under the common appellation, sometimes,  of _Saxons_, sometimes of _Angles_; and speaking the same  language, and being governed by the same institutions, they were  naturally led, from these causes, as well as from their common interest,  to unite themselves against the ancient inhabitants. The resistance,  however, though unequal, was still maintained by the Britons; but became  every day more feeble; and their calamities admitted of few intervals,  till they were driven into Cornwall and Wales, and received protection  from the remote situation or inaccessible mountains of those countries.    The first Saxon state, after that of Kent, which was established in  Britain, was the kingdom of South Saxony. In the year 477,[**] AElla,  a Saxon chief, brought over an army from Germany; and, landing on  the southern coast, proceeded to take possession of the neighboring  territory. The Britons, now armed, did not tamely abandon their  possessions; nor were they expelled till defeated in many battles  by their war-like invaders. The most memorable action, mentioned by  historians, is that of Mearcredes Burn;[***] where, though the Saxons  seem to have obtained the victory, they suffered so considerable a loss,  as somewhat retarded the progress of their conquests.         [* Bede, lib. i. cap. 15. Ethelwerd, p. 833, edit.       Camdeni. Chron. Sax. p. 12. Alured. Beverl. p. 78. The       inhabitants of Kent and the Isle of Wight were Jutes. Essex,       Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex, and all the southern counties to       Cornwall, were peopled by Saxons: Mercis mud other parts of       the kingdom were inhabited by Angles.]         [** Chron. Sax. p.14. Alured Beverl. p. 81.]         [*** Chron. Sax. A. D. 485. Flor. Wigron]    But AElla, reenforced by fresh numbers of his countrymen, again took the  field against the Britons; and laid siege to Ancired Ceaster, which was  defended by the garrison and inhabitants with desperate valor.[*] The  Saxons, enraged by this resistance, and by the fatigues and dangers  which they had sustained, redoubled their efforts against the place;  and, when masters of it, put all their enemies to the sword without  distinction. This decisive advantage secured the conquests of AElla, who  assumed the name of king, and extended his dominion over Sussex and a  great part of Surrey He was stopped in his progress to the east by the  kingdom of Kent; in that to the west by another tribe of Saxons, who had  taken possession of that territory.    These Saxons, from the situation of the country in which they settled,  were called the _West Saxons_, and landed in the year 495, under  the command of Cerdic, and of his son Kenric.[**] The Britons were, by  past experience, so much on their guard, and so well prepared to receive  the enemy, that they gave battle to Cerdic the very day of his landing;  and, though vanquished, still defended, for some time, their liberties  against the invaders. None of the other tribes of Saxons met with such  vigorous resistance, or exerted such valor and perseverance in pushing  their conquests. Cerdic was even obliged to call for the assistance of  his countrymen from the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex, as well as from  Germany, and he was thence joined by a fresh army under the command  of Porte, and of his sons Bleda and Megla.[***] Strengthened by these  succors, he fought, in the year 508, a desperate battle with the  Britons, commanded by Nazan Leod, who was victorious in the beginning of  the action, and routed the wing in which Cerdic himself commanded. But  Kenric, who had prevailed in the other wing, brought timely assistance  to his father, and restored the battle, which ended in a complete  victory gained by the Saxons.[****] Nazan Leod perished, with  five thousand of his army; but left the Britons more weakened than  discouraged by his death. The war still continued, though the success  was commonly on the side of the Saxons, whose short swords and manner  of fighting gave them great advantage over the missile weapons of the  Britons.         [* H. Hunting, lib. ii.]         [** W. Malms, lib. i. cap. I, p. 12. Chron. Sax. p.       15.]         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 17.]         [**** H. Hunting, lib ii. Ethelwerd, lib. i. Chron.       Sax. p. 17.]    Cerdic was not wanting to in good fortune; and in order to extend  his conquests, he laid siege to Mount Badon or Banesdowne, near Bath,  whither the most obstinate of the discomfited Britons had retired. The  southern Britons, in this extremity, applied for assistance to Arthur,  prince of the Silures, whose heroic valor now sustained the declining  fate of his country.[*] This is that Arthur so much celebrated in the  songs of Thaliessin, and the other British bards, and whose military  achievements have been blended with so many fables, as even to give  occasion for entertaining a doubt of his real existence. But poets,  though they disfigure the most certain history by their fictions, ana  use strange liberties with truth where they are the sole historians, as  among the Britons, have commonly some foundation for their wildest  exaggerations. Certain it is, that the siege of Badon was raised by the  Britons in the year 520; and the Saxons were there discomfited in a  great battle.[**] This misfortune stopped the progress of Cerdic; but  was not sufficient to wrest from him the conquests which he had already  made. He and his son Kenric, who succeeded him, established the kingdom  of the West Saxons, or of Wessex, over the counties of Hants, Dorset,  Wilts, Berks, and the Isle of Wight, and left their new-acquired  dominions to their posterity. Cerdic died in 534, Kenric in 560.      While the Saxons made this progress in the south, their countrymen were  not less active in other quarters. In the year 527, a great tribe of  adventurers, under several leaders, landed on the east coast of Britain;  and after fighting many battles, of which history has preserved no  particular account, they established three new kingdoms in this island.  Uffa assumed the title of king of the East Angles in 575; Crida, that of  Mercia in 585;[***] and Erkenwin, that of East Saxony, or Essex, nearly  about the same time; but the year is uncertain. This latter kingdom was  dismembered from that of Kent, and comprehended Essex, Middlesex,  and part of Hertfordshire; that of the East Angles, the counties of  Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk: Mercia was extended over all the middle  counties from the banks of the Severn to the frontiers of these two  kingdoms.         [* H. Hunting, lib. ii.]         [** Gildas, Chron. Sax. H. Hunting, lib. ii.]         [*** M. West. H. Hunting, lib. ii.]    The Saxons, soon after the landing of Hengist, had been planted in  Northumberland; but as they met with an obstinate resistance, and made  but small progress in subduing the inhabitants, their affairs were in  so unsettled a condition, that none of their princes for a long time  assumed the appellation of king. At last, in 547,[*] Ida, a Saxon prince  of great valor,[**] who claimed a descent, as did all the other princes  of that nation, from Woden, brought over a reenforcement from Germany,  and enabled the Northumbrians to carry on their conquests over the  Britons. He entirely subdued the county now called Northumberland,  the bishopric of Durham, as well as some of the south-east counties of  Scotland; and he assumed the crown under the title of king of Bernicia.  Nearly about the same time, AElla, another Saxon prince, having conquered  Lancashire and the greater part of Yorkshire, received the appellation  of king of Deiri.[***] These two kingdoms were united in the person of  Ethelfrid, grandson of Ida, who married Acca, the daughter of AElla; and  expelling her brother Edwin, established one of the most powerful of the  Saxon kingdoms, by the title of Northumberland. How far his dominions  extended into the country now called Scotland is uncertain: but it  cannot be doubted, that all the lowlands, especially the east coast of  that country, were peopled in a great measure from Germany; though the  expeditions, made by the several Saxon adventurers, have escaped the  records of history. The language spoken in those countries, which is  purely Saxon, is a stronger proof of this event than can be opposed by  the imperfect, or rather fabulous annals, which are obtruded on us by  the Scottish historians.
