Caste deities.      Among the special deities of the Ahirs is Kharak Deo, who is always  located at the _khirkha_, or place of assembly of the cattle, on  going to and returning from pasture. He appears to be the spirit or  god of the _khirkha_. He is represented by a platform with an image  of a horse on it, and when cattle fall ill the owners offer flour  and butter to him. These are taken by the Ahirs in charge, and it is  thought that the cattle will get well. Matar Deo is the god of the  pen or enclosure for cattle made in the jungle. Three days after the  Diwali festival the Rawats sacrifice one or more goats to him, cutting  off their heads. They throw the heads into the air, and the cattle,  smelling the blood, run together and toss them with their horns as  they do when they scent a tiger. The men then say that the animals  are possessed by Matar Deo. Guraya Deo is a deity who lives in the  cattle-stalls in the village and is worshipped once a year. A man  holds an egg in his hand, and walks round the stall pouring liquid  over the egg all the way, so as to make a line round it. The egg is  then buried beneath the shrine of the god, the rite being probably  meant to ensure his aid for the protection of the cattle from disease  in their stalls. A favourite saint of the Ahirs is Haridas Baba. He  was a Jogi, and could separate his soul from his body at pleasure. On  one occasion he had gone in spirit to Benares, leaving his body  in the house of one of his disciples, who was an Ahir. When he did  not return, and the people heard that a dead body was lying there,  they came and insisted that it should be burnt. When he came back  and found that his body was burnt, he entered into a man and spoke  through him, telling the people what had happened. In atonement for  their unfortunate mistake they promised to worship him.        14. Other deities.      The Mahakul Ahirs of Jashpur have three deities, whom they call Mahadeo  or Siva, Sahadeo, one of the five Pandava brothers, and the goddess  Lakshmi. They say that the buffalo is Mahadeo, the cow Sahadeo,  and the rice Lakshmi. This also appears to be an instance of the  personification of animals and the corn into anthropomorphic deities.        15. The Diwali festival.      The principal festival of the Ahirs is the Diwali, falling about the  beginning of November, which is also the time when the autumn crops  ripen. All classes observe this feast by illuminating their houses  with many small saucer-lamps and letting off crackers and fireworks,  and they generally gamble with money to bring them good luck during  the coming year. The Ahirs make a mound of earth, which is called  Govardhan, that is the mountain in Mathura which Krishna held upside  down on his finger for seven days and nights, so that all the people  might gather under it and be protected from the devastating storms of  rain sent by Indra. After dancing round the mound they drive their  cattle over it and make them trample it to pieces. At this time a  festival called Marhai is held, at which much liquor is drunk and  all classes disport themselves. In Damoh on this day the Ahirs go to  the standing-place for village cattle, and after worshipping the god,  frighten the cattle by waving leaves of the basil-plant at them, and  then put on fantastic dresses, decorating themselves with cowries,  and go round the village, singing and dancing. Elsewhere at the time  of the Marhai they dance round a pole with peacock feathers tied to the  top, and sometimes wear peacock feathers themselves, as well as aprons  sewn all over with cowries. It is said that Krishna and Balaram used  to wear peacock feathers when they danced in the jungles of Mathura,  but this rite has probably some connection with the worship of the  peacock. This bird might be venerated by the Ahirs as one of the  prominent denizens of the jungle. In Raipur they tie a white cock  to the top of the pole and dance round it. In Mandla, Khila Mutha,  the god of the threshing-floor, is worshipped at this time, with  offerings of a fowl and a goat. They also perform the rite of _jagana_  or waking him up. They tie branches of a small shrub to a stick and  pour milk over the stone which is his emblem, and sing, 'Wake up,  Khila Mutha, this is the night of Amawas' (the new moon). Then they  go to the cattle-shed and wake up the cattle, crying, 'Poraiya,  god of the door, watchman of the window, open the door, Nand Gowal  is coming.' Then they drive out the cattle and chase them with the  branches tied to their sticks as far as their grazing-ground. Nand  Gowal was the foster-father of Krishna, and is now said to signify a  man who has a lakh (100,000) of cows. This custom of frightening the  cattle and making them run is called _dhor jagana_ or _bichkana_, that  is, to wake up or terrify the cattle. Its meaning is obscure, but it is  said to preserve the cattle from disease during the year. In Raipur the  women make an image of a parrot in clay at the Diwali and place it on  a pole and go round to the different houses, singing and dancing round  the pole, and receiving presents of rice and money. They praise the  parrot as the bird who carries messages from a lover to his mistress,  and as living on the mountains and among the green verdure, and sing:    \"Oh, parrot, where shall we sow _gondla_ grass and where shall we  sow rice?    \"We will sow _gondla_ in a pond and rice in the field.    \"With what shall we cut _gondla_ grass, and with what shall we  cut rice?    \"We shall cut _gondla_ with an axe and rice with a sickle.\"    It is probable that the parrot is revered as a spirit of the forest,  and also perhaps because it is destructive to the corn. The parrot  is not, so far as is known, associated with any god, but the Hindus  do not kill it. In Bilaspur an ear of rice is put into the parrot's  mouth, and it is said there that the object of the rite is to prevent  the parrots from preying on the corn.        16. Omens.      On the night of the full moon of Jesth (May) the Ahirs stay awake  all night, and if the moon is covered with clouds they think that  the rains will be good. If a cow's horns are not firmly fixed in  the head and seem to shake slightly, it is called Maini, and such an  animal is considered to be lucky. If a bullock sits down with three  legs under him and the fourth stretched out in front it is a very  good omen, and it is thought that his master's cattle will increase  and multiply. When a buffalo-calf is born they cover it at once with  a black cloth and remove it from the mother's sight, as they think  that if she saw the calf and it then died her milk would dry up. The  calf is fed by hand. Cow-calves, on the other hand, are usually left  with the mother, and many people allow them to take all the milk,  as they think it a sin to deprive them of it.        17. Social customs.      The Ahirs will eat the flesh of goats and chickens, and most of them  consume liquor freely. The Kaonra Ahirs of Mandla eat pork, and the  Rawats of Chhattisgarh are said not to object to field-mice and rats,  even when caught in the houses. The Kaonra Ahirs are also said not to  consider a woman impure during the period of menstruation. Nevertheless  the Ahirs enjoy a good social status, owing to their relations with  the sacred cow. As remarked by Eha: \"His family having been connected  for many generations with the sacred animal he enjoys a certain  consciousness of moral respectability, like a man whose uncles are  deans or canons.\" [27] All castes will take water from the hands of  an Ahir, and in Chhattisgarh and the Uriya country the Rawats and  Gahras, as the Ahir caste is known respectively in these localities,  are the only caste from whom Brahmans and all other Hindus will take  water. On this account, and because of their comparative purity,  they are largely employed as personal servants. In Chhattisgarh the  ordinary Rawats will clean the cooking-vessels even of Muhammadans,  but the Thethwar or pure Rawats refuse this menial work. In Mandla,  when a man is to be brought back into caste after a serious offence,  such as getting vermin in a wound, he is made to stand in the middle  of a stream, while some elderly relative pours water over him. He  then addresses the members of the caste _panchayat_ or committee,  who are standing on the bank, saying to them, 'Will you leave me in  the mud or will you take me out?' Then they tell him to come out,  and he has to give a feast. At this a member of the Meliha sept first  eats food and puts some into the offender's mouth, thus taking the  latter's sin upon himself. The offender then addresses the _panchayat_  saying, 'Rajas of the Panch, eat.' Then the _panchayat_ and all the  caste take food with him and he is readmitted. In Nandgaon State the  head of the caste _panchayat_ is known as Thethwar, the title of the  highest subcaste, and is appointed by the Raja, to whom he makes a  present. In Jashpur, among the Mahakul Ahirs, when an offender is put  out of caste he has on readmission to make an offering of Rs. 1-4 to  Balaji, the tutelary deity of the State. These Mahakuls desire to be  considered superior to ordinary Ahirs, and their social rules are hence  very strict. A man is put out of caste if a dog, fowl or pig touches  his water or cooking-pots, or if he touches a fowl. In the latter  case he is obliged to make an offering of a fowl to the local god,  and eight days are allowed for procuring it. A man is also put out of  caste for beating his father. In Mandla, Ahirs commonly have the title  of Patel or headman of a village, probably because in former times,  when the country consisted almost entirely of forest and grass land,  they were accustomed to hold large areas on contract for grazing.        18.
