That a narrow and brutal nationalism, which the post-war  theory of self-determination has served to reinforce, has been chiefly  responsible for the policy of high and prohibitive tariffs, so injurious  to the healthy flow of international trade and to the mechanism of  international finance, is a fact which few would venture to dispute.    It would be idle, however, to contend that the war, with all the losses it  involved, the passions it aroused and the grievances it left behind, has  solely been responsible for the unprecedented confusion into which almost  every section of the civilized world is plunged at present. Is it not a  fact--and this is the central idea I desire to emphasize--that the  fundamental cause of this world unrest is attributable, not so much to the  consequences of what must sooner or later come to be regarded as a  transitory dislocation in the affairs of a continually changing world, but  rather to the failure of those into whose hands the immediate destinies of  peoples and nations have been committed, to adjust their system of  economic and political institutions to the imperative needs of a rapidly  evolving age? Are not these intermittent crises that convulse present-day  society due primarily to the lamentable inability of the world's  recognized leaders to read aright the signs of the times, to rid  themselves once for all of their preconceived ideas and fettering creeds,  and to reshape the machinery of their respective governments according to  those standards that are implicit in Baha'u'llah's supreme declaration of  the Oneness of Mankind--the chief and distinguishing feature of the Faith  He proclaimed? For the principle of the Oneness of Mankind, the  cornerstone of Baha'u'llah's world-embracing dominion, implies nothing  more nor less than the enforcement of His scheme for the unification of  the world--the scheme to which we have already referred. \"In every  Dispensation,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"the light of Divine Guidance has been  focussed upon one central theme.... In this wondrous Revelation, this  glorious century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the  distinguishing feature of His Law is the consciousness of the Oneness of  Mankind.\"    How pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human institutions  who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are striving to adjust  national processes, suited to the ancient days of self-contained nations,  to an age which must either achieve the unity of the world, as adumbrated  by Baha'u'llah, or perish. At so critical an hour in the history of  civilization it behooves the leaders of all the nations of the world,  great and small, whether in the East or in the West, whether victors or  vanquished, to give heed to the clarion call of Baha'u'llah and,  thoroughly imbued with a sense of world solidarity, the sine qua non of  loyalty to His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety the one  remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed for an ailing  humanity. Let them discard, once for all, every preconceived idea, every  national prejudice, and give heed to the sublime counsel of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  the authorized Expounder of His teachings. You can best serve your  country, was 'Abdu'l-Baha's rejoinder to a high official in the service of  the federal government of the United States of America, who had questioned  Him as to the best manner in which he could promote the interests of his  government and people, if you strive, in your capacity as a citizen of the  world, to assist in the eventual application of the principle of  federalism underlying the government of your own country to the  relationships now existing between the peoples and nations of the world.    In The Secret of Divine Civilization (The Mysterious Forces of  Civilization), 'Abdu'l-Baha's outstanding contribution to the future  reorganization of the world, we read the following:    \"True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart of the  world whenever a certain number of its distinguished and high-minded  sovereigns--the shining exemplars of devotion and determination--shall, for  the good and happiness of all mankind, arise, with firm resolve and clear  vision, to establish the Cause of Universal Peace. They must make the  Cause of Peace the object of general consultation, and seek by every means  in their power to establish a Union of the nations of the world. They must  conclude a binding treaty and establish a covenant, the provisions of  which shall be sound, inviolable and definite. They must proclaim it to  all the world and obtain for it the sanction of all the human race. This  supreme and noble undertaking--the real source of the peace and well-being  of all the world--should be regarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth.  All the forces of humanity must be mobilized to ensure the stability and  permanence of this Most Great Covenant. In this all-embracing Pact the  limits and frontiers of each and every nation should be clearly fixed, the  principles underlying the relations of governments towards one another  definitely laid down, and all international agreements and obligations  ascertained. In like manner, the size of the armaments of every government  should be strictly limited, for if the preparations for war and the  military forces of any nation should be allowed to increase, they will  arouse the suspicion of others. The fundamental principle underlying this  solemn Pact should be so fixed that if any government later violate any  one of its provisions, all the governments on earth should arise to reduce  it to utter submission, nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with  every power at its disposal, to destroy that government. Should this  greatest of all remedies be applied to the sick body of the world, it will  assuredly recover from its ills and will remain eternally safe and  secure.\"    \"A few,\" He further adds, \"unaware of the power latent in human endeavor,  consider this matter as highly impracticable, nay even beyond the scope of  man's utmost efforts. Such is not the case, however. On the contrary,  thanks to the unfailing grace of God, the loving-kindness of His favored  ones, the unrivaled endeavors of wise and capable souls, and the thoughts  and ideas of the peerless leaders of this age, nothing whatsoever can be  regarded as unattainable. Endeavor, ceaseless endeavor, is required.  Nothing short of an indomitable determination can possibly achieve it.  Many a cause which past ages have regarded as purely visionary, yet in  this day has become most easy and practicable. Why should this most great  and lofty Cause--the day-star of the firmament of true civilization and the  cause of the glory, the advancement, the well-being and the success of all  humanity--be regarded as impossible of achievement? Surely the day will  come when its beauteous light shall shed illumination upon the assemblage  of man.\"          Seven Lights of Unity      In one of His Tablets 'Abdu'l-Baha, elucidating further His noble theme,  reveals the following:    \"In cycles gone by, though harmony was established, yet, owing to the  absence of means, the unity of all mankind could not have been achieved.  Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the peoples of one and  the same continent association and interchange of thought were well nigh  impossible. Consequently intercourse, understanding and unity amongst all  the peoples and kindreds of the earth were unattainable. In this day,  however, means of communication have multiplied, and the five continents  of the earth have virtually merged into one.... In like manner all the  members of the human family, whether peoples or governments, cities or  villages, have become increasingly interdependent. For none is  self-sufficiency any longer possible, inasmuch as political ties unite all  peoples and nations, and the bonds of trade and industry, of agriculture  and education, are being strengthened every day. Hence the unity of all  mankind can in this day be achieved. Verily this is none other but one of  the wonders of this wondrous age, this glorious century. Of this past ages  have been deprived, for this century--the century of light--has been endowed  with unique and unprecedented glory, power and illumination. Hence the  miraculous unfolding of a fresh marvel every day. Eventually it will be  seen how bright its candles will burn in the assemblage of man.    \"Behold how its light is now dawning upon the world's darkened horizon.  The first candle is unity in the political realm, the early glimmerings of  which can now be discerned. The second candle is unity of thought in world  undertakings, the consummation of which will ere long be witnessed. The  third candle is unity in freedom which will surely come to pass. The  fourth candle is unity in religion which is the corner-stone of the  foundation itself, and which, by the power of God, will be revealed in all  its splendor. The fifth candle is the unity of nations--a unity which in  this century will be securely established, causing all the peoples of the  world to regard themselves as citizens of one common fatherland. The sixth  candle is unity of races, making of all that dwell on earth peoples and  kindreds of one race. The seventh candle is unity of language, i.e., the  choice of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and  converse. Each and every one of these will inevitably come to pass,  inasmuch as the power of the Kingdom of God will aid and assist in their  realization.\"          A World Super-State      Over sixty years ago, in His Tablet to Queen Victoria, Baha'u'llah,  addressing \"the concourse of the rulers of the earth,\" revealed the  following:    \"Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which  profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof.... Regard the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#8)"],[1,"'llah, therefore, they made him  notorious and famous on the tongues of friends and foes, and wrote  letters, ostensibly at his dictation, to the Bab. And since secret  correspondences were in process the Bab highly approved of this scheme. So  Mirza Yahya was concealed and hidden while mention of him was on the  tongues and in the mouths of men. And this mighty plan was of wondrous  efficacy, for Baha'u'llah, though He was known and seen, remained safe and  secure, and this veil was the cause that no one outside [the sect]  fathomed the matter or fell into the idea of molestation, until  Baha'u'llah quitted Tihran at the permission of the King and was permitted  to withdraw to the Supreme Shrines.    When He reached Ba_gh_dad and the crescent moon of the month of Muharram  of the year [A.H. one thousand two hundred and] sixty-nine (which was  termed in the books of the Bab \"the year of 'after a while'\" and wherein  He had promised the disclosure of the true nature of His religion and its  mysteries) shone forth from the horizon of the world, this covert secret,  as is related, became apparent amongst all within and without [the  society]. Baha'u'llah with mighty steadfastness became a target for the  arrows of all amongst mankind, while Mirza Yahya in disguise passed his  time, now in the environs and vicinity of Ba_gh_dad engaged for better  concealment in various trades, now in Ba_gh_dad itself in the garb of the  Arabs.    Now Baha'u'llah so acted that the hearts of this sect were drawn towards  Him, while most of the inhabitants of 'Iraq were reduced to silence and  speechlessness, some being amazed and others angered. After remaining  there for one year He withdrew His hand from all things, abandoned  relatives and connections, and, without the knowledge of His followers,  quitted 'Iraq alone and solitary, without companion, supporter, associate,  or comrade. For nigh upon two years He dwelt in Turkish Kurdistan,  generally in a place named Sar-Galu, situated in the mountains, and far  removed from human habitations. Sometimes on rare occasions He used to  frequent Sulaymaniyyih. Ere long had elapsed the most eminent doctors of  those regions got some inkling of His circumstances and conditions, and  conversed with Him on the solution of certain difficult questions  connected with the most abstruse points of theology. Having witnessed on  His part ample signs and satisfactory explanations they observed towards  Him the utmost respectfulness and deference. In consequence of this He  acquired a great fame and wonderful reputation in those regions, and  fragmentary accounts of Him were circulated in all quarters and  directions, to wit that a stranger, a Persian, had appeared in the  district of Sulaymaniyyih (which hath been, from of old, the place whence  the most expert doctors of the Sunnites have arisen), and that the people  of that country had loosed their tongues in praise of Him. From the rumor  thus heard it was known that that Person was none other than Baha'u'llah.  Several persons, therefore, hastened thither, and began to entreat and  implore, and the urgent entreaty of all brought about His return.    Now although this sect had not been affected with quaking or consternation  at these grievous events, such as the slaughter of their Chief and the  rest, but did rather increase and multiply; still, since the Bab was but  beginning to lay the foundations when He was slain, therefore was this  community ignorant concerning its proper conduct, action, behavior, and  duty, their sole guiding principle being love for the Bab. This ignorance  was the reason that in some parts disturbances occurred; for, experiencing  violent molestation, they unclosed their hands in self-defense. But after  His return Baha'u'llah made such strenuous efforts in educating, teaching,  training, regulating, and reconstructing this community that in a short  while all these troubles and mischiefs were quenched, and the utmost  tranquility and repose reigned in men's hearts; so that, according to what  hath been heard, it became clear and obvious even to statesmen that the  fundamental intentions and ideas of this sect were things spiritual, and  such as are connected with pure hearts; that their true and essential  principles were to reform the morals and beautify the conduct of the human  race, and that with things material they had absolutely no concern.    When these principles, then, were established in the hearts of this sect  they so acted in all lands that they became celebrated amongst statesmen  for gentleness of spirit, steadfastness of heart, right intent, good  deeds, and excellence of conduct. For this people are most well-disposed  towards obedience and submissiveness, and, on receiving such instruction,  they conformed their conduct and behavior thereto. Formerly exception was  taken to the words, deeds, demeanor, morals, and conduct of this sect: now  objection is made in Persia to their tenets and spiritual state. Now this  is beyond the power of man, that he should be able by interference or  objection to change the heart and conscience, or meddle with the  convictions of anyone. For in the realm of conscience naught but the ray  of God's light can command, and on the throne of the heart none but the  pervading power of the King of Kings should rule. Thus it is that one can  arrest and suspend [the action of] every faculty except thought and  reflection; for a man cannot even by his own volition withhold himself  from reflection or thought, nor keep back his musings and imaginings.    At all events the undeniable truth is this, that for nigh upon thirty-five  years no action opposed to the government or prejudicial to the nation has  emanated from this sect or been witnessed [on their part], and that during  this long period, notwithstanding the fact that their numbers and strength  are double what they were formerly, no sound has arisen from any place,  except that every now and then learned doctors and eminent scholars  (really for the extension of this report through the world and the  awakening of men) sentence some few to death. For such interference is not  destruction but edification when thou regardest the truth, which will not  thereby become quenched and forgotten, but rather stimulated and  advertised.    I will at least relate one short anecdote of what actually took place. A  certain person violently molested and grievously injured a certain Babi.  The victim unclosed his hand in retaliation and arose to take vengeance,  unsheathing his weapon against the aggressor. Becoming the object of  censure and reprimand of this sect, however, he took refuge in flight.          [Pages 41-60]      When he reached Hamadan his character became known, and, as he was of the  clerical class, the doctors vehemently pursued him, handed him over to the  government, and ordered chastisement to be inflicted. By chance there fell  out from the fold of his collar a document written by Baha'u'llah, the  subject of which was reproof of attempts at retaliation, censure and  reprobation of the search after vengeance, and prohibition from following  after lusts. Amongst other matters they found these expressions contained  in it: \"Verily God is quit of the seditious,\" and likewise: \"If ye be  slain it is better for you than that ye should slay. And when ye are  tormented have recourse to the controllers of affairs and the refuge of  the people; and if ye be neglected then entrust your affairs to the  Jealous Lord. This is the mark of the sincere, and the characteristic of  the assured.\" When the governor became cognizant of this writing he  addressed that person saying, \"By the decree of that Chief whom you  yourself obey correction is necessary and punishment and chastisement  obligatory.\" \"If,\" replied that person, \"you will carry out all His  precepts I shall have the utmost pleasure in [submitting to] punishment  and death.\" The governor smiled and let the man go.    So Baha'u'llah made the utmost efforts to educate [His people] and incite  [them] to morality, the acquisition of the sciences and arts of all  countries, kindly dealing with all the nations of the earth, desire for  the welfare of all peoples, sociability, concord, obedience,  submissiveness, instruction of [their] children, production of what is  needful for the human race, and inauguration of true happiness for  mankind; and He continually kept sending tracts of admonition to all  parts, whereby a wonderful effect was produced. Some of these epistles  have, after extreme search and inquiry, been examined, and some portions  of them shall now be set down in writing.    All these epistles consisted of [exhortations to] purity of morals,  encouragement to good conduct, reprobation of certain individuals, and  complaints of the seditious. Amongst others this sentence was recorded:    \"My captivity is not My abasement: by My life, it is indeed a glory unto  Me! But the abasement is the action of My friends who connect themselves  with Us and follow the devil in their actions. Amongst them is he who  taketh lust and turneth aside from what is commanded; and amongst them is  he who followeth the truth in right guidance. As for those who commit sin  and cling to the world they are assuredly not of the people of Baha.\"    So again: \"Well it is with him who is adorned with the decoration of  manners and morals: verily he is of those who help their Lord with clear  perspicuous action.\"    \"He is God, exalted is His state, wisdom and utterance. The True One  (glorious is His glory) for the showing forth of the gems of ideals from  the mine of man, hath, in every age, sent a Trusted One. The primary  foundation of the faith of God and the religion of God is this, that they  should not make diverse sects and various paths the cause and reason of  hatred. These principles and laws and firm sure roads appear from one  dawning-place and shine from one dayspring,"]]]
