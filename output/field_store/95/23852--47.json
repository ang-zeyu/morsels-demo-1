[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#8)"],[1,"of that portion of my  report which I submitted to you this morning--acting upon information  supplied by Miss Helen Cumberly?\"    \"Yes, yes, Inspector, I have read it--but, by the way, I do not know  Miss Cumberly.\"    \"Miss Cumberly,\" explained the detective, \"is the daughter of Dr.  Cumberly, the Harley Street physician. She lives with her father in  the flat above that of Mr. Leroux. She saw the body by accident--and  recognized it as that of a lady who had been named to her at the last  Arts Ball.\"    \"Ah!\" said Debnam, \"yes--I see--at the Arts Ball, Inspector. This is a  mysterious and a very ghastly case.\"    \"It is indeed, sir,\" agreed Dunbar. \"Can you throw any light upon the  presence of Mrs. Vernon at Mr. Leroux's flat on the very night of her  husband's death?\"    \"I can--and I cannot,\" answered the solicitor, leaning back in the  chair and again adjusting his pince-nez, in the manner of a man having  important matters--and gloomy, very gloomy, matters--to communicate.    \"Good!\" said the inspector, and prepared to listen.    \"You see,\" continued Debnam, \"the late Mrs. Vernon was not actually  residing with her husband at the date of his death.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Ostensibly\"--the solicitor shook a lean forefinger at his  vis-a-vis--\"ostensibly, Inspector, she was visiting her sister in  Scotland.\"    Inspector Dunbar sat up very straight, his brows drawn down over the  tawny eyes.    \"These visits were of frequent occurrence, and usually of about a  week's duration. Mr. Vernon, my late client, a man--I'll not deny it--of  inconstant affections (you understand me, Inspector?), did not greatly  concern himself with his wife's movements. She belonged to a smart  Bohemian set, and--to use a popular figure of speech--burnt the candle  at both ends; late dances, night clubs, bridge parties, and other  feverish pursuits, possibly taken up as a result of the--shall I say  cooling?--of her husband's affections\"...    \"There was another woman in the case?\"    \"I fear so, Inspector; in fact, I am sure of it: but to return to Mrs.  Vernon. My client provided her with ample funds; and I, myself, have  expressed to him astonishment respecting her expenditures in Scotland. I  understand that her sister was in comparatively poor circumstances,  and I went so far as to point out to Mr. Vernon that one hundred  pounds was--shall I say an excessive?--outlay upon a week's sojourn in  Auchterander, Perth.\"    \"A hundred pounds!\"    \"One hundred pounds!\"    \"Was it queried by Mr. Vernon?\"    \"Not at all.\"    \"Was Mr. Vernon personally acquainted with this sister in Perth?\"    \"He was not, Inspector. Mrs. Vernon, at the time of her marriage, did  not enjoy that social status to which my late client elevated her. For  many years she held no open communication with any member of her  family, but latterly, as I have explained, she acquired the habit of  recuperating--recuperating from the effects of her febrile pleasures--at  this obscure place in Scotland. And Mr. Vernon, his interest in  her movements having considerably--shall I say abated?--offered no  objection: even suffered it gladly, counting the cost but little  against\"...    \"Freedom?\" suggested Dunbar, scribbling in his notebook.    \"Rather crudely expressed, perhaps,\" said the solicitor, peering  over the top of his glasses, \"but you have the idea. I come now to my  client's awakening. Four days ago, he learned the truth; he learned that  he was being deceived!\"    \"Deceived!\"    \"Mrs. Vernon, thoroughly exhausted with irregular living, announced  that she was about to resort once more to the healing breezes of the  heather-land\"--Mr. Debnam was thoroughly warming to his discourse and  thoroughly enjoying his own dusty phrases.    \"Interrupting you for a moment,\" said the inspector, \"at what intervals  did these visits take place?\"    \"At remarkably regular intervals, Inspector: something like six times a  year.\"    \"For how long had Mrs. Vernon made a custom of these visits?\"    \"Roughly, for two years.\"    \"Thank you. Will you go on, sir?\"    \"She requested Mr. Vernon, then, on the last occasion to give her a  check for eighty pounds; and this he did, unquestioningly. On Thursday,  the second of September, she left for Scotland\"...    \"Did she take her maid?\"    \"Her maid always received a holiday on these occasions; Mrs. Vernon  wired her respecting the date of her return.\"    \"Did any one actually see her off?\"    \"No, not that I am aware of, Inspector.\"    \"To put the whole thing quite bluntly, Mr. Debnam,\" said Dunbar, fixing  his tawny eyes upon the solicitor, \"Mr. Vernon was thoroughly glad to  get rid of her for a week?\"    Mr. Debnam shifted uneasily in his chair; the truculent directness of  the detective was unpleasing to his tortuous mind. However:--    \"I fear you have hit upon the truth,\" he confessed, \"and I must admit  that we have no legal evidence of her leaving for Scotland on this, or  on any other occasion. Letters were received from Perth, and letters  sent to Auchterander from London were answered. But the truth, the  painful truth came to light, unexpectedly, dramatically, on Monday  last\"...    \"Four days ago?\"    \"Exactly; three days before the death of my client.\" Mr. Debnam wagged  his finger at the inspector again. \"I maintain,\" he said, \"that this  painful discovery, which I am about to mention, precipitated my client's  end; although it is a fact that there was--hereditary heart trouble.  But I admit that his neglect of his wife (to give it no harsher name)  contributed to the catastrophe.\"    He paused to give dramatic point to the revelation.    \"Walking homeward at a late hour on Monday evening from a flat in  Victoria Street--the flat of--shall I employ the term a particular  friend?--Mr. Vernon was horrified--horrified beyond measure, to  perceive, in a large and well-appointed car--a limousine--his wife!\"...    \"The inside lights of the car were on, then?\"    \"No; but the light from a street lamp shone directly into the car. A  temporary block in the traffic compelled the driver of the car, whom my  client described to me as an Asiatic--to pull up for a moment. There,  within a few yards of her husband, Mrs. Vernon reclined in the car--or  rather in the arms of a male companion!\"    \"What!\"    \"Positively!\" Mr. Debnam was sedately enjoying himself. \"Positively, my  dear Inspector, in the arms of a man of extremely dark complexion. Mr.  Vernon was unable to perceive more than this, for the man had his back  toward him. But the light shone fully upon the face of Mrs. Vernon, who  appeared pale and exhausted. She wore a conspicuous motor-coat of civet  fur, and it was this which first attracted Mr. Vernon's attention. The  blow was a very severe one to a man in my client's state of health; and  although I cannot claim that his own conscience was clear, this open  violation of the marriage vows outraged the husband--outraged him. In  fact he was so perturbed, that he stood there shaking, quivering,  unable to speak or act, and the car drove away before he had recovered  sufficient presence of mind to note the number.\"    \"In which direction did the car proceed?\"    \"Toward Victoria Station.\"    \"Any other particulars?\"    \"Not regarding the car, its driver, or its occupants; but early on the  following morning, Mr. Vernon, very much shaken, called upon me and  instructed me to despatch an agent to Perth immediately. My agent's  report reached me at practically the same time as the news of my  client's death\"...    \"And his report was?\"...    \"His report, Inspector, telegraphic, of course, was this: that no sister  of Mrs. Vernon resided at the address; that the place was a cottage  occupied by a certain Mrs. Fry and her husband; that the husband was of  no occupation, and had no visible means of support\"--he ticked off the  points on the long forefinger--\"that the Frys lived better than any  of their neighbors; and--most important of all--that Mrs. Fry's maiden  name, which my agent discovered by recourse to the parish register of  marriages--was Ann Fairchild.\"    \"What of that?\"    \"Ann Fairchild was a former maid of Mrs. Vernon!\"    \"In short, it amounts to this, then: Mrs. Vernon, during these various  absences, never went to Scotland at all? It was a conspiracy?\"    \"Exactly--exactly, Inspector! I wired instructing my agent to extort  from the woman, Fry, the address to which she forwarded letters received  by her for Mrs. Vernon. The lady's death, news of which will now have  reached him, will no doubt be a lever, enabling my representative to  obtain the desired information.\"    \"When do you expect to hear from him?\"    \"At any moment. Failing a full confession by the Frys, you will of  course know how to act, Inspector?\"    \"Damme!\" cried Dunbar, \"can your man be relied upon to watch them? They  mustn't slip away! Shall I instruct Perth to arrest the couple?\"    \"I wired my agent this morning, Inspector, to communicate with the local  police respecting the Frys.\"    Inspector Dunbar tapped his small, widely-separated teeth with the end  of his fountain-pen.    \"I have had one priceless witness slip through my fingers,\" he muttered.  \"I'll hand in my resignation if the Frys go!\"    \"To whom do you refer?\"    Inspector Dunbar rose.    \"It is a point with which I need not trouble you, sir,\" he said. \"It was  not included in the extract of report sent to you. This is going to be  the biggest case of my professional career, or my name is not Robert  Dunbar!\"    Closing his notebook, he thrust it into his pocket, and replaced his  fountain-pen in the little leather wallet.    \"Of course,\" said the solicitor, rising in turn, and adjusting the  troublesome pince-nez, \"there was some intrigue with Leroux? So much is  evident.\"    \"You will be thinking that, eh?\"    \"My dear Inspector\"--Mr. Debnam, the wily, was seeking information--\"my  dear Inspector, Leroux's own wife was absent in Paris--quite a safe  distance; and Mrs."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#8)"],[1,"e; but cease this strain;       It is too sad. It cuts me to the heart,       And wakes a sorrow without bounds--such grief       I bear for him, my lord, of whom I think       Continually; whose glory is abroad       Through Hellas and through Argos, everywhere.'           \"And then Telemachus, the prudent, spake--       Why, O my mother! canst thou not endure       That thus the well graced poet should delight       His hearers with a theme to which his mind       Is inly moved? The bards deserve no blame;       Jove is the cause, for he at will inspires       The lay that each must sing.'\"    Later than the Homeric rhapsodists, the Hesiodic poems were composed  and sung similarly by wandering minstrels, who, although wandering,  were not on that account lowly esteemed. There were regular schools,  or more properly guilds, of rhapsodists, into which only those were  admitted as masters who were able to treat the current topics with the  light and inspiring touch of real poetry, and only those taken as  apprentices who evinced proper talent and promise. The training of  these schools was long, partly spent in acquiring technique of  treating subjects and the mastery of the lyre, and partly in  memorizing the Homeric and Hesiodic hymns. It is supposed that these  poems were transmitted for more than three centuries orally in this  way, before having been reduced to writing.    In Hesiod's poem of \"The Shield of Hercules\" (Bank's translation,  365), the general idea of the Greek festive processions is  illustrated:         \"There men in dances and in festive joys       Held revelry. Some on the smooth-wheeled car       A virgin bride conducted; then burst forth       Aloud the marriage song; and far and wide       Long splendors flash'd from many a quivering torch       Borne in the hands of slaves. Gay blooming girls       Preceded, and the dancers followed blithe:       These, with shrill pipe indenting the soft lip,       Breath'd melody, while broken echoes thrill'd       Around them; to the lyre with flying touch       Those led the love-enkindled dance. A group       Of youths was elsewhere imaged, to the flute       Disporting; some in dances, and in song;       In laughter others. To the minstrel's flute       So pass'd they on; and the whole city seem'd       As fill'd with pomps, with dances, and with feasts.\"    So again in the same poem (274) there is a scene of a minstrel contest  among the immortal gods themselves, described by the poet from one of  the scenes upon the shield of Hercules.         \"And the tuneful choir appear'd       Of heaven's immortals; in the midst, the son       Of Jove and of Latona sweetly rang       Upon his golden harp; th' Olympian mount,       Dwelling of gods, thrill'd back the broken sound.       And there were seen th' assembly of the gods       Listening; encircled with beatitude;       And in sweet contest with Apollo there       The virgins of Pieria raised the strain       Preluding; and they seemed as though they sang       With clear, sonorous voices.\"    As early as 750 B.C. we find the famous rhapsodist, Terpander,  summoned to Sparta to sing patriotic songs, in the hope of preventing  a secession of this rather unruly state. He accomplished his mission,  a circumstance creditable alike to the talent of the poet-minstrel and  the high estimation in which the class was held.    The application of music to patriotic purposes was no novelty.  Plutarch, in his \"Life of Lycurgus,\" says that \"Thales was famed for  his wisdom and his political abilities; he was withal a lyric poet  who, under cover of exercising his art, performed as great things as  the most excellent lawgivers. For his odes were so many persuasions to  obedience and unanimity, and as by means of numbers they had great  grace and power, they softened insensibly the manners of the audience,  drew them off from the animosities which then prevailed, and united  them in zeal for excellence and virtue.\" Again, of the subject matter  of the Spartan songs, he says: \"Their songs had a spirit which could  arouse the soul and impel to an enthusiastic action. The language was  plain and manly; the subject serious and moral. For they consisted  chiefly of praises of heroes who had died for Sparta, or else of  expressions of detestation for such wretches as had declined the  glorious privilege.\"    About this time the art of choral song began to be much cultivated in  Greece, particularly in connection with the cult of certain  divinities, especially Dionysos and Apollo. By the term choral song we  are not to understand anything resembling our singing of a chorus in  parts. There was no part-singing in Greece, but merely a singing, or  rather chanting, of national and patriotic songs in unison,  accompanied by the cithara, the national instrument.    Plato speaks of the imitative and semi-dramatic character of the  choral dance (\"Laws,\" II, 655): \"Choric movements are imitations of  manners occurring in various actions, chances, characters--each  particular is imitated, and those to whom the words, the song or the  dances are suited, either by nature or habit, or both, cannot help  feeling pleasure in them and calling them beautiful.\"    About 500 B.C. a room was rented upon the market place for the  practice of the chorus. Every town had its body of singers, who sang  and performed the evolutions of the representative dance appropriate  to the service of the particular divinity to whom they were devoted.  Presently competitive singing came into vogue, in connection with the  famous games, and the art of the poet was taxed, as well as the  musical and more purely vocal arts of the singers themselves, striving  in honorable competition for the glory of their native towns.    In some of the festival occasions the proceedings of the choral songs  were varied by the leader, who improvised rhapsodies upon topics  connected with the life of the divinity or upon national stories. At  proper points the chorus came in with the refrain, which remained a  fixed quantity, being put in, apparently, at whatever points the  inspiration or breath of the leader needed a point of repose. None of  these compositions have come down to us, but the allusions to them in  ancient writings give, perhaps, a sufficiently accurate idea of their  nature.    The added interest incident to the fresh improvisations of the leader  in this form of choral song presently opened toward a lyric drama.  Thespis is credited with having been the first to place the leader  upon a centrally located stage where he could be plainly seen and  heard by all concerned. Now the recitations became more dramatic, the  choruses more varied. The speaker illustrated by gestures the acts  which he described; he varied his style of delivery according to the  feeling appropriate to the incidents represented. The chorus meanwhile  was not upon the stage, but in a central location below, and during  their strophes they circled around the platform of the leader in a  sort of mystic dance, each man accompanying himself upon his cithara.  From this to adding a second speaker to the one already upon the stage  was but a short step. It was taken, and the result was a drama with a  chorus in connection. In the earlier plays the speakers represented as  many characters as necessary for carrying out the action. Later they  changed costume to some extent, the chorus meanwhile occupying the  time with their own songs, which generally had the character of a  comment upon the action as developed at the moment. The changes of  costume were extremely slight, merely a different head dress, a mantle  or some slight modification of appearance more or less symbolical in  character. All the dialogue was delivered in a musical voice, and, it  is thought, all accompanied by the cithara, which every player carried  in his hand. The instrument was sometimes played all the time, in the  same notes as those of the song or chant; at other, times the speaker  employed it for ritournelles, for affording breathing time or points  of emphasis. Once in a great while, it is thought, the instrument had  a note different from that of the song in connection with it. Upon  this point great uncertainty prevails.    At length, about 470 B.C., AEschylus, the great tragedian, made his  debut as actor and author, and placed three speakers upon the stage.  Besides the three principals, each man had a suite, if his station  demanded such an appendage according to the ideas or customs of the  times. These, however, had the rank of supernumeraries, merely  following the speaker around, but never taking part in the dialogue.  The principals each represented more than one character, effecting  some slight change of costume for indicating the transformation. The  stage was simply an open platform, with three doors in the rear. The  actor entering by one door represented a prince at home; from another  a prince abroad; by another door he represented a common person. The  chorus occupied the central place in front of the stage, much in the  same location as the parquet is now. In the center of this space was  an altar, originally dedicated to Dionysos, and an offering was  probably placed upon it. Later the Choreagos, or leader of the chorus,  sat upon it and directed the movements of the singers, much as the  operatic director does now. The theaters were very large, being vast  amphitheaters, open to the sky, but with an awning available over the  more expensive seats. The seats were of stone, arranged exactly like  those in a modern circus. The theater in Athens is said to have held  25,000 persons. At first admission was free, the theater being  conducted by the state. The plays were mounted very expensively at  times, although with the absence of scenery or properties of an  elaborate character it is not easy to imagine what was the use made of  the vast sums reported to have been expended in different"]]]
