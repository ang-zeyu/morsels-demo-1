Letter of January 17th, 1923      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.    Dear friends:    It is a great pleasure for me to share with you the translation(4) of some  of the prayers and Tablets of our beloved Master, the reading of which I  trust will inspire you and strengthen you in your work of service to His  Cause.    I trust that in the course of time I will be enabled to send you regularly  correct and reliable translations of the various prayers and Tablets of  Baha'u'llah, and 'Abdu'l-Baha, which will unfold to your eyes a new vision  of His Glorious Mission on earth and give you an insight into the  character and meanings of His Divine Teachings.    I shall await very eagerly any suggestions you would like to give me on  this point and on all other matters that pertain to the interests of the  Cause in America, and I assure you again of my readiness and wish to be of  help and service to those faithful and devoted servants of Baha'u'llah in  that land.    Your brother and co-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  January 17th, 1923.          Letter of February 13, 1923      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.    Dearest friends:    I have just completed the translation of a number of selections(5) from  the Master's soul-stirring Words to His loved ones in Persia, revealed  some twenty-five years ago, and during the darkest days of His  incarceration in the prison city of Akka.    You will realize, as you read them, the unshakable confidence of  'Abdu'l-Baha in the inevitable growth of the Cause, even in the most  perilous days of His life. Their perusal will enable you all to grasp more  fully the significance of this Movement and its dynamic power, the urgent  need for sustained unity and harmony amongst the friends, and the glory of  the station that awaits in the world to come every faithful servant of  Baha'u'llah.    May they contribute their share to the unfolding of the Spirit of the  Cause in that land, and may they infuse in all the friends that ardent  spirit of service and fellowship that will enable them to fulfill their  glorious destiny in this world!    Your brother and co-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  February 13, 1923.          Letter of March 12, 1923      To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout  America, Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Japan and  Australasia.    Fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!    Over a year has elapsed since that calamitous Hour, when the glorious  Person of 'Abdu'l-Baha was veiled from mortal eyes and His Spirit ascended  to the Kingdom of Glory; and I feel that the time is now ripe to take  those fresh and momentous decisions which will enable us to fulfill,  speedily and faithfully, the last wishes of our departed Master.    The year has been to the outside world a year of fear and suffering, of  disillusion and turmoil. To us, however, the bereaved followers of a  gracious and loving Master, it has been, despite the passing cares which  His sudden departure must necessarily entail, a period of hope, of  wholesome activity, marked throughout with a spirit of undiminished  confidence in His power and of fidelity to His Cause.    From the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, the  unnumbered servants of Baha'u'llah, disdainful of the evil machinations of  the enemies of His Cause, the breakers of His behests, have rallied to His  Standard, and risen with one accord to carry on the great Work He has  entrusted to their charge. All-hail to that undying spirit of fidelity  which burns and shall burn unceasingly, in the breasts of His loved ones!  Great shall be their reward, and blissful the hour, when after a toilsome  life of service, they are gathered to the glory of Baha, and partake in  their Beloved's Presence, of the joy of eternal Reunion.          Condition of the World      But great achievements still await us in this world, and we feel confident  that, by His grace and never-failing guidance, we shall now and ever prove  ourselves worthy to fulfill His great Purpose for mankind. And who can  fail to realize the sore need of bleeding humanity, in its present state  of uncertainty and peril, for the regenerating Spirit of God, manifested  this Day so powerfully in this Divine Dispensation? Four years of  unprecedented warfare and world cataclysms, followed by another four years  of bitter disappointment and suffering, have stirred deeply the conscience  of mankind, and opened the eyes of an unbelieving world to the Power of  the Spirit that alone can cure its sicknesses, heal its wounds, and  establish the long-promised reign of undisturbed prosperity and peace.          Responsibility of Baha'is      Now surely, if ever, is the time for us, the chosen ones of Baha'u'llah  and the bearers of His Message to the world, to endeavor by day and by  night, to deepen, first and foremost, the Spirit of His Cause in our own  individual lives, and then labor, and labor incessantly to exemplify in  all our dealings with our fellow-men that noble Spirit of which His  beloved Son 'Abdu'l-Baha has been all the days of His life a true and  unique exponent. The sayings of our beloved Master have been noised  abroad, His name has filled all regions, and the eyes of mankind are now  turned expectant towards His disciples who bear His name and profess His  teachings. Shall we not by our daily life vindicate the high claims of His  teachings, and prove by our services the influence of His undying Spirit?  This surely is our highest privilege, and our most sacred duty.    Let us, with a pure heart, with humility and earnestness, turn afresh to  His counsels and exhortations, and seek from that Source of Celestial  Potency all the guidance, the spirit, the power which we shall need for  the fulfillment of our mission in this life.    Behold, the station to which 'Abdu'l-Baha is now calling His loved ones  from the Realm of Glory:--    \"It behooveth the loved ones of God to be enamored of one another and to  sacrifice themselves for their fellow-workers in the Cause. They should  yearn towards one another even as the sore athirst yearneth for the Water  of Life, and the lover burneth to meet his heart's desire.\"    Such is the sublime, the glorious position He wishes us, and all the  peoples and kindreds on earth, to attain in this world; how much more to  achieve unity and common understanding among ourselves, and then arise to  herald with one voice the coming of the Kingdom and the salvation of  mankind.    With unity of purpose firmly established in our minds, with every trace of  personal animosity banished from our hearts, and with the spirit of  whole-hearted and sustained fellowship kindled in our souls, can we hope  to deliver effectively the Message of Baha'u'llah, and execute faithfully  the various provisions of our Beloved's Will and Testament.    Steadfast in our faith, firm in our union, abounding in our hope, fervent  in our spirit, and selfless in our labors, let us arise and with prayerful  hearts make another and supreme effort to fulfill these last words of our  Beloved, His most cherished desire:    \"O ye that stand fast in the Covenant! When the hour cometh that this  wronged and broken winged bird will have taken its flight unto the  Celestial Concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of the  Unseen, and its mortal frame will have either been lost or hidden neath  the dust, it is incumbent upon the Afnan that are steadfast in the  Covenant of God and have branched from the Tree of Holiness, the Hands of  the Cause of God (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), and all the  friends and loved ones, one and all, to bestir themselves and arise with  heart and soul and in one accord to diffuse the sweet savors of God, to  teach His Cause and to promote His Faith. It behooveth them not to rest  for a moment, neither to seek repose. They must disperse themselves in  every land, pass by every clime, and travel throughout all regions.  Bestirred, without rest, and steadfast to the end, they must raise in  every land the triumphal cry of Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha, must achieve renown in  the world wherever they go, must burn brightly even as a candle in every  meeting, and must kindle the flame of Divine Love in every assembly; that  the Light of Truth may rise resplendent in the midmost heart of the world,  that throughout the East and throughout the West a vast concourse may  gather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the sweet savors of  Holiness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly, hearts be filled  with the Divine Spirit and souls be made heavenly. In these days the most  important of all things is the guidance of the nations and the peoples of  the world. Teaching the Cause is of utmost importance, for it is the head  corner-stone of the foundation itself. This wronged servant has spent his  days and nights in promoting the Cause, and urging the peoples to service.  He rested not a moment, till the fame of the Cause of God was noised  abroad in the world, and the Celestial Strains from the Abha Kingdom  roused the East and the West. The beloved of God must also follow the same  example. This is the secret of faithfulness, this is the requirement of  servitude to the Threshold of Baha.\"    We need but glance at the Words of Baha'u'llah and the Epistles of  'Abdu'l-Baha to realize the great privilege of teaching the Cause, its  vital necessity, its supreme urgency, and its wide-reaching effects. These  are the very words of 'Abdu'l-Baha:--    \"In these days, the Holy Ones of the Realm of Glory, dwelling in the  all-highest Paradise, yearn to return unto this world, and be of some  service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah and prove their servitude to the  Threshold of Abha beauty.\"    What a wondrous vision these words unfold to our eyes! How great our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#8)"],[1,"loyalty, with great wisdom,  with unshakable courage, the Cup of Salvation at so critical an hour, to  the confused, the hungry, the distraught and fear-stricken multitudes, in  the north, in the west, in the south and in the heart, of that sorely  tried continent.            EUROPE FEELS STIRRINGS OF SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION      The second century of the Baha'i Era has dawned. The second stage of the  Divine Plan has been launched. The second epoch of the Formative Age of  the Baha'i Dispensation has opened. The tragedy of a continent, so  blessed, so rich in history, so harassed, is moving towards a climax. The  vanguard of the torchbearers of a world-redeeming civilization are landing  on its shores and are settling in its capitals. An epoch has commenced,  inaugurating the systematic conquest of the European continent by the  organized body of the \"apostles of Baha'u'llah,\" destined to unfold its  potentialities in the course of succeeding centuries, and bidding fair to  eclipse the radiance of those past ages which have successfully witnessed  the introduction of the Christian Faith into the continent's northern  climes, the efflorescence of Islamic culture that shed such radiance along  its southern shores, and the rise of the Reformation in its very heart.    The stage is set. The hour is propitious. The signal is sounded.  Baha'u'llah's spiritual battalions are moving into position. The initial  clash between the forces of darkness and the army of light, as unnoticed  as the landing, two milleniums ago, of the apostles of Christ on the  southern shores of the European continent, is being registered by the  denizens of the Abha Kingdom. The Author of the Plan that has set so  titanic an enterprise in motion is Himself mounted at the head of these  battalions, and leads them on to capture the cities of men's hearts. A  continent, twice blessed by 'Abdu'l-Baha's successive visits to its  shores, and the scene of His first public appearance in the West; which  has been the cradle of a civilization to some of whose beneficent features  the pen of Baha'u'llah has paid significant tribute; on whose soil both  the Greek and Roman civilizations were born and flourished; which has  contributed so richly to the unfoldment of American civilization; the  fountainhead of American culture; the mother of Christendom, and the scene  of the greatest exploits of the followers of Jesus Christ; in some of  whose outlying territories have been won some of the most resplendent  victories which ushered in the Golden Age of Islam; which sustained, in  its very heart, the violent impact of the onrushing hosts of that Faith,  intent on the subjugation of its cities, but which refused to bend the  knee to its invaders, and succeeded in the end in repulsing their  assault--such a continent is now experiencing, at the hands of the little  as yet unnoticed band of pioneers sent forth by the enviable, the  privileged, the dynamic American Baha'i Community, the first stirrings of  that spiritual revolution which must culminate, in the Golden Age that is  as yet unborn, in the permanent establishment of Baha'u'llah's Order  throughout that continent.            DIVINE PLAN CHALLENGES NORTH AMERICAN BELIEVERS      One word in conclusion to those to whom the Tablets of so stupendous a  Plan have been addressed, to whose care the destinies of so prodigious an  enterprise have been committed, and of whom such titanic efforts are now  demanded. I can do no better than recall, nor can I sufficiently  emphasize, or refrain from quoting anew, those stirring and pregnant  passages that illuminate the pages of 'Abdu'l-Baha's epoch-making Tablets.    In one of these Tablets, addressed to the believers in the Northeastern  States, these weighty and highly significant words are recorded: \"All  countries, in the estimation of the one true God, are but one country, and  all cities and villages are on an equal footing... Through faith and  certitude, and the precedence achieved by one over another, however, the  dweller conferreth honor upon the dwelling, some of the countries achieve  distinction, and attain a preeminent position. For instance,  notwithstanding that some of the countries of Europe and of America are  distinguished by, and surpass other countries in, the salubrity of their  climate, the wholesomeness of their water, and the charm of their  mountains, plains and prairies, yet Palestine became the glory of all  nations inasmuch as all the holy and Divine Manifestations, from the time  of Abraham until the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets (Muhammad),  have lived in, or migrated to, or traveled through, that country.  Likewise, Mecca and Medina have achieved illimitable glory, as the light  of Prophethood shone forth therein. For this reason Palestine and Hijaz  have been distinguished from all other countries.\" \"Likewise,\" is His  remarkable disclosure, \"the continent of America is, in the eyes of the  one true God, the land wherein the splendors of His light shall be  revealed, where the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled, the home of  the righteous, and the gathering-place of the free.\"    To those of His followers, dwelling in that enviable and blessed  continent, He has chosen to address these no less inspiring words, as  recorded in one of those Tablets revealed in honor of the believers of the  United States and Canada: \"O ye apostles of Baha'u'llah! May my life be  sacrificed for you!... Behold the portals which Baha'u'llah hath opened  before you! Consider how exalted and lofty is the station you are destined  to attain, how unique the favors with which you have been endowed... My  thoughts are turned towards you, and my heart leaps within me at your  mention. Could ye know how my soul gloweth with your love, so great a  happiness would flood your hearts as to cause you to become enamored with  each other.\" \"The full measure of your success,\" He, in another Tablet,  addressed to the entire company of His followers in the North American  continent these prophetic words: \"is as yet unrevealed, its significance  unapprehended. Erelong ye will with your own eyes witness how brilliantly  every one of you, even as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of  your country the light of divine guidance, and will bestow upon its people  the glory of an everlasting life... I fervently hope that in the near  future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your  achievements. The hope which 'Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you is that the  same success which has attended your efforts in America may crown your  endeavors in other parts of the world, that through you the fame of the  Cause of God may be diffused throughout the East and the West, and the  advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five  continents of the globe. The moment this Divine Message is carried forward  by the American believers from the shores of America, and is propagated  through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australia, and  as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself  securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. Then will  all the peoples of the world witness that this community is spiritually  illumined and divinely guided. Then will the whole earth resound with the  praises of its majesty and greatness... Know ye of a certainty that  whatever gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit are surging over  it, and the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that  gathering... O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost  poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha in  cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans promote the divine  teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please  God, ye may achieve it... Thus far ye have been untiring in your labors.  Let your exertions henceforth increase a thousandfold. Summon the people  in these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter  the Abha Kingdom. The scope of your exertions must needs be extended. The  wider its range, the more striking will be the evidence of divine  assistance.\"            DETACHMENT FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD      \"Now is the time,\" He no less significantly remarks in another of these  Tablets, \"for you to divest yourselves of the garment of attachment to  this world that perisheth, to be wholly severed from the physical world,  become heavenly angels, and travel to these countries. I swear by Him  besides Whom there is none other God that each one of you will become an  Israfil of Life, and will blow the Breath of Life into the souls of  others.\" And lastly this glorious promise in another of those immortal  Tablets: \"Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly  evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and  the throne of the Kingdom of God, will, in the plenitude of its majesty  and glory, be firmly established.\"    In one of the earliest Tablets addressed by Him to the American believers  these equally significant words have been penned: \"If ye be truly united,  if ye agree to promote that which is the essential purpose, and to show  forth an all-unifying love, I swear by Him Who causeth the seed to split  and the breeze to waft, so great a light will shine forth from your faces  as to reach the highest heavens, the fame of your glory will be noised  abroad, the evidences of your preeminence will spread throughout all  regions, your power will penetrate the realities of all things, your aims  and purposes will exert their influence upon the great and mighty nations,  your spirits will encompass the whole world of being, and ye will discover  yourselves to be kings in the dominions of the Kingdom, and attired with  the glorious crowns of the invisible Realm, and become the marshals of the  army of peace, and princes of the"]]]
