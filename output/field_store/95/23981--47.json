[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],[0,"A Middle High German Primer (#8)"],[1,"{bb}), {tt}, {ck}  ({gg}); {pf}, {tz}, {ck} in MHG. (Secs. 23,2, 26), as {sippe} ({sibbe}),  Goth. {sibja}, _relationship_; {bitten}, later {biten}, Goth. {bidjan},  _to request_; {tretten} (_wv._): {tr[e:]ten} _(sv.), to tread_; {br[u:]cke}  ({br[u:]gge}), _bridge_; {ecke} ({egge}), _edge_; {m[u:]cke} ({m[u:]gge}),  _midge_; {r[u:]cke} ({r[u:]gge}), _ridge, back_. {schepfen}, Goth. {skapjan},  _to create_; {hitze}, _heat_: {hei[z]}, _hot_; {netzen}, _to wet_: {na[z]},  _wet_; {setzen}, Goth. {satjan}, _to set_; {sitzen}, _to sit_: pret.  {sa[z]}, p.p. {ges[e:][zz]en}; {decken}, _to cover_: {dach}, _cover_;  {l[u:]cke}, _gap_: {loch}, _hole_. {zellen}, later {zeln}, _to count_:  {zal}, _number_. {vremmen}, later {vremen} (OE. {fremman}), _to perform_.  {henne}, _hen_: {hane}, _cock_.    In MHG. the double consonants in verbs were often simplified through the  levelling out of forms which regularly had a single consonant, e.g.  regular forms were: {vremmen}, _to perform_, sing. {vremme}, {vremes(t),  vremet}, pl. {vremmen}, {vremmet}, {vremment}, pret. {vremete}, p.p.  {gevremet}, then the stem-form with single {m} was levelled out into all  the forms, and similarly with many other verbs, as {denen}, _to  stretch_; {seln}, _to hand over_; {weln}, _to choose_; {wenen}, _to  accustom_; {legen} beside {lecken} ({leggen}), _to lay_; and the strong  verbs {biten}, _to beg_; {ligen} beside {licken (liggen)}, _to lie  down_.      Sec. 32.    Double consonants were simplified:--    1. When they became final, as {boc}, _buck_, {kus}, _kiss_, {man},  _man_, {schif}, _ship_, {stum}, _dumb_, {v[e:]l}, _hide_, beside gen.  {bockes}, {kusses}, {mannes}, {schiffes}, {stummes}, {v[e:]lles}; pret.  {ma[z]}, {ran}, {traf}, beside {m[e:][zz]en}, _to measure_, {rinnen}, _to run_,  {tr[e:]ffen}, _to hit_.    2. Before other consonants, as pret. {dacte (dahte), nante (nande),  kuste}, beside {decken}, _to cover_, {nennen}, _to name_, {k[u:]ssen}, _to  kiss_.    3. After consonants, as pret. {sante} ({sande}) from {*santte}, {wante}  ({wande}) from {*wantte}, beside {senden}, _to send_, {wenden}, _to  turn_.    4. After long vowels and diphthongs, as pret. sing. {leite} from  {*leitte}, pret. pl. {m[a][z]en}, {tr[a]fen}, {vielen}, beside {leiten},  _to lead_, {m[e:][zz]en}, _to measure_, {tr[e:]ffen}, _to hit_, {vallen},  _to fall_. This simplification of double consonants took place during the  OHG. period, as {sl[a]fan}, _to sleep_, {hei[z]an}, _to call_, {loufan},  _to run_, {zeichan}, _token_, beside older OHG. {sl[a]ffan}, {hei[zz]an},  {louffan}, {zeihhan}.      Sec. 33.    In MHG. the lenes {b, d, g} became the fortes {p, t, c (k)} when they  ended a syllable, that is when they came to stand finally, or medially  before a voiceless consonant. Traces of this law existed already in OHG.  The interchange between the lenes and fortes includes two independent  processes, viz. the change of the medial lenes {b, d, g} to the final  fortes {p, t, k}, and the change of the final {f, s} to the medial  intervocalic lenes {v} and to what is written {s} (cp. also NHG.  {lesen}, {las}). It must be noted that in MHG. the interchanging pairs  of consonants were all voiceless and that the difference merely  consisted in the intensity or force with which the sounds were produced.  This is quite different from NHG. where the interchange is between  voiced and voiceless sounds except in the case of {f} which is voiceless  in all positions in native words. Examples are: {g[e:]ben}, _to give_,  {gelouben}, _to believe_, {w[e:]rben}, _to turn_, beside pret. {gap},  {geloupte}, {warp}; gen. {l[i]bes}, {lambes}, beside nom. {l[i]p}, _life_,  {lamp}, _lamb_. {binden}, _to bind_, {w[e:]rden}, _to become_, beside pret.  {bant}, {wart}; gen. {kindes}, {t[o]des}, beside nom. {kint}, _child_,  {t[o]t}, _death_. {biegen}, _to bend_, {singen}, _to sing_, {zeigen}, _to  show_, beside pret. {bouc}, {sanc}, {zeicte}; gen. {tages}, {b[e:]rges},  beside nom. {tac}, _day_, {b[e:]rc}, _mountain_. {n[e:]ve}, _nephew_, beside  {niftel}, _niece_; gen. {hoves}, {brieves}, beside nom. {hof}, _court_,  {brief}, _letter_. {kiesen}, _to choose_, {l[e:]sen}, _to gather_, {l[oe]sen},  _to loose_, beside pret. {k[o]s}, {las}, {l[o]ste}; pl. {hiuser}, beside  sing. {h[u]s}, _house_.      Sec. 34.    Final {ch} after vowels interchanged with medial {h}, as {schuoch},  _shoe_, gen. {schuohes}; {h[o]ch}, _high_, gen. {h[o]hes}; {n[a]ch}, _near_,  adv. {n[a]he}; pret. {geschach}, {sach}, beside {gesch[e:]hen}, _to happen_,  {s[e:]hen}, _to see_.    The medial combinations {lh}, {rh} were written {lch}, {rch} when they  came to stand finally, as {bev[e:]lhen}, _to confide_, pret. {bevalch};  gen. {sch[e:]lhes}, {tw[e:]rhes}, beside nom. {sch[e:]lch}, {tw[e:]rch},  _askew_, see Sec. 19. {h} (= {ch}) and {ch} often disappeared in unstressed  syllables and particles, as {[)e]t}, _only_, {h[i]nte}, {h[i]nt},  _to-night_, {niet}, _not_, {dur}, _through_, beside {[e:]ht}, {h[i]naht},  {niht}, {nieht}, {durch}.      Sec. 35.    Initial {j} became or was written {g} before a following {i}, as  {gihet}, _he assures_, beside inf. {j[e:]hen}, pret. {jach}, and similarly  {j[e:]sen}, _to ferment_, {j[e:]ten}, _to weed_. In the verba pura forms with  and without the intervocalic glide {j} existed side by side in OHG. and  MHG., as {bl[u:]ejen} (OHG. {bluojen}) beside {bl[u:]en} (OHG. {bluoen}),  _to bloom_; and similarly {dr[ae]jen}, _to twist_, {m[u:]ejen}, _to trouble_,  {s[ae]jen}, _to sow_, beside {dr[ae]n}, {m[u:]en}, {s[ae]n}. In a few words  forms with and without intervocalic {j (g)} existed side by side, as gen.  {bl[i]ges} beside nom. {bl[i]}, _lead_; {eijer}, {eiger} beside {eier},  _eggs_; {fr[i]jen}, {fr[i]gen} beside {fr[i]en}, _to free_; {meige}, {meie},  _May_; {nerigen}, {nerjen} beside {nern}, _to save_, _rescue_;  {swerigen}, {swerjen} beside {swern}, _to swear_; gen. {zw[i]ges},  {zw[i]es}, nom. {zw[i]}, _twig_; gen. {zweiger}, {zweier}, _of two_.      Sec. 36.    In OHG. {w} became vocalized to {o} when it came to stand at the end of  a word or syllable, and then generally disappeared after long vowels,  but the medial {w} regularly remained in OHG. and MHG. when it was at  the beginning of a syllable, as {bl[a]} (OHG. {bl[a]o}, {bl[a]}), _blue_, gen.  {bl[a]wes}; {sn[e]} (OHG. {sn[e]o}, {sn[e]}), _snow_, gen. {sn[e]wes}; {str[o]}  (OHG. {strao}, {str[o]} by contraction), _straw_, gen. {str[o]wes}; {knie}  (OHG. {kneo}), _knee_, gen. {kniewes}, OHG. {kn[e:]wes}; {schate} (OHG.  {scato}), _shadow_, gen. {schat(e)wes}; pret. {blou}, {hiu}, {kou},  beside {bliuwen}, _to strike_, {houwen}, _to hew_, {kiuwen}, _to chew_;  {fal} (OHG. {falo}), _fallow_, gen. {falwes}; {gar} (OHG. {garo}),  _ready_, gen. {garwes}; {m[e:]l} (OHG. {m[e:]lo}), _meal_, gen. {m[e:]lwes};  {sm[e:]r} (OHG. {sm[e:]ro}), _fat_; pret. {smirte}, {str[o:]ute}, beside  {smirwen}, _to smear_, {str[o:]uwen}, _to strew_. See Sec. 9, r.    The {w} element sometimes disappeared in the initial combinations  {qua-}, {qu[a]-}, {qu[e:]-}, {qui-}, {qu[i]-} partly with and partly without  influencing the quality of the following vowel, as pret. sing. {kam},  {kom} beside {quam}, _he came_, pret. pl. {k[o]men}, {k[a]men} beside  {qu[a]men}; {k[a]le} beside {qu[a]le}, _torture_; {k[e:]c} beside {quec},  _alive_; {korder}, {k[o:]rder} beside {qu[e:]rder}, _bait_; {komen},  {k[o:]men}, {kumen} beside {qu[e:]men}, _to come_; pres. sing. {kume},  {k[u:]m(e)s(t)}, {kum(e)s(t)}, {k[u:]m(e)t}, {kum(e)t} = OHG. {quimu},  {quimis}, {quimit}; {k[u:]cken} beside {quicken}, _to enliven_; {k[i]t}  beside {qu[i]t} = {quidet}, _he says_.      Sec. 37.    Medial {-ibe-}, {-ide-}, {-ige-} were sometimes contracted to {[i]}; and  medial {-age-}, {-ege-} to {ei}, as {g[i]st}, _thou givest_, {g[i]t}, _he  gives_, beside {gibes(t)}, {gibet}; {qu[i]st}, _thou sayest_, {qu[i]t}, _he  says_, beside {quides(t)}, {quidet}; {l[i]st}, _thou liest down_, {l[i]t},  _he lies down_, beside {liges(t)}, {liget}. {meit} beside {maget},  _maid_; {seist}, _thou sayest_, {seit}, _he says_, beside {sages(t)},  {saget}; {leist}, _thou layest_, {leit}, _he lays_, beside {leges(t)},  {leget}; {eisl[i]ch} beside {egesl[i]ch}, _terrible_; {gein} beside {gegen},  _against_.      Sec. 38.    Intervocalic {h} often disappeared when the first vowel was long, and  then the two vowels underwent contraction, as {h[a]n}, _to hang_, {v[a]n},  _to catch_, {vl[e]n}, _to implore_, {h[o]} (adv.), _high_, beside {h[a]hen},  {v[a]hen}, {vl[e]hen}, {h[o]he}. Other contracted forms will be found in the  Glossary.      Sec. 39.    The final {r} disappeared after long vowels in monosyllables when the  next word began with a consonant, but was often restored analogically,  as {d[a]} (OHG. {d[a]r}), _there_: {d[a]rinne}, _therein_; {w[a]} (OHG.  {w[a]r}), _where_: {w[a]rinne}, _wherein_; {hie} (OHG. {hiar}): {hierunder},  _hereunder_; adv. {m[e]} (OHG. {m[e]r}), _more_; {[e]} (OHG. {[e]r}),  _formerly_; {s[a]} (OHG. {s[a]r}), _at once_.      Sec. 40.    Medial {t} (Sec. 25) became {d} after nasals in late OHG. and early MHG.,  as {senden}, _to send_, gen. {blindes} (nom. {blint}, _blind_), pret.  {nande}, _he named_, {r[u]mde}, _he left_, beside early MHG. {senten},  {blintes}, {nante}, {r[u]mte}. It also occasionally became {d} after {l},  as {halden} beside {halten}, _to hold_, {solde} beside {solte}, pret. of  {suln}, _shall_.          ACCIDENCE    CHAPTER III      DECLENSION OF NOUNS    Sec. 41.    MHG. nouns have two numbers: singular and plural; three genders:  masculine, feminine, and neuter, as in OHG. and NHG., from which the  gender of nouns in MHG. does not materially differ; four cases:  nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative. Traces of an old locative  occur in what is called the uninflected dative singular of {h[u]s},  _house_, beside {h[u]se}, and in proper names like {Engellant} beside  {Engellande}. The vocative is like the nominative.    In MHG., as in the older "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],[0,"Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#8)"],[1," his life was only saved by the quickness of Vich Ian  Vohr, who seized him and flung him down, holding him there by main force  till the whole herd had rushed over them. When Edward tried to rise, he  found that he had severely sprained his ankle.    However, among those present at the _drive_, there was found an old man,  half-surgeon, half-conjurer, who applied hot fomentations, muttering all  the time of the operation such gibberish as _Gaspar-Melchior-Balthazar-max-prax-fax!_    Thus it happened that, to his great disappointment, Edward was unable to  accompany the clansmen and their chiefs any farther. So Vich Ian Vohr  had Edward placed in a litter, woven of birch and hazel, and walked  beside this rude couch to the house of an old man, a smaller chieftain,  who, with only a few old vassals, lived a retired life at a place called  Tomanrait.    Here he left Edward to recruit, promising to come back in a few days, in  the hope that by that time Edward would be able to ride a Highland pony  in order to return to Glennaquoich.    On the sixth morning Fergus returned, and Edward gladly mounted to  accompany him. As they approached the castle, he saw, with pleasure,  Flora coming to meet them.      II. MISFORTUNES NEVER COME SINGLE    The Chief's beautiful sister appeared very glad to see Edward, and, as  her brother spoke a few hasty words to her in Gaelic, she suddenly  clasped her hands, and, looking up to heaven, appeared to ask a blessing  upon some enterprise. She then gave Edward some letters that had arrived  for him during his absence. It was perhaps as well that Edward took  these to his room to open, considering the amount of varied ill news  that he found in them.    The first was from his father, who had just been dismissed from his  position as King's minister, owing (as he put it) to the ingratitude of  the great--but really, as was proved afterwards, on account of some  political plots which he had formed against his chief, the prime  minister of the day.    Then his generous uncle, Sir Everard, wrote that all differences were  over between his brother and himself. He had espoused his quarrel, and  he directed Edward at once to send in the resignation of his commission  to the War Office without any preliminaries, forbidding him longer to  serve a government which had treated his father so badly.    But the letter which touched Edward most deeply was one from his  commanding officer at Dundee, which declared curtly that if he did not  report himself at the headquarters of the regiment within three days  after the date of writing, he would be obliged to take steps in the  matter which would be exceedingly disagreeable to Captain Waverley.    Edward at once sat down and wrote to Colonel Gardiner that, as he had  thus chosen to efface the remembrance of past civilities, there was  nothing left to him but to resign his commission, which he did formally,  and ended his letter by requesting his commanding officer to forward  this resignation to the proper quarter.    No little perplexed as to the meaning of all this, Edward was on his way  to consult Fergus Mac-Ivor on the subject, when the latter advanced with  an open newspaper in his hand.    \"Do your letters,\" he asked, \"confirm this unpleasant news?\"    And he held out the _Caledonian Mercury_, in which not only did he find  his father's disgrace chronicled, but on turning to the _Gazette_ he  found the words, \"Edward Waverley, Captain in the --th regiment of  dragoons, superseded for absence without leave.\" The name of his  successor, one Captain Butler, followed immediately.    On looking at the date of Colonel Gardiner's missive as compared with  that of the _Gazette_, it was evident that his commanding officer had  carried out his threat to the letter. Yet it was not at all like him to  have done so. It was still more out of keeping with the constant  kindness that he had shown to Edward. It was the young man's first idea,  in accordance with the customs of the time, to send Colonel Gardiner a  challenge. But, upon Fergus Mac-Ivor's advice, Edward ultimately  contented himself with adding a postscript to his first letter, marking  the time at which he had received the first summons, and regretting that  the hastiness of his commander's action had prevented his anticipating  it by sending in his resignation.    \"That, if anything,\" said Fergus, \"will make this Calvinistic colonel  blush for his injustice.\"    But it was not long before some part at least of the mystery was made  plain. Fergus took advantage of Edward's natural anger at his unworthy  treatment, to reveal to him that a great rising was about to take place  in the Highlands in favour of King James, and to urge him to cast in his  lot with the clans. Flora, on the contrary, urged him to be careful and  cautious, lest he should involve others to whom he owed everything, in a  common danger with himself.    Edward, whose fancy (if not whose heart) had gradually been turning more  and more toward the beautiful and patriotic Flora, appeared less  interested in rebellion than in obtaining her brother's good-will and  bespeaking his influence with his sister.    \"Out upon you,\" cried Fergus, with pretended ill-humour, \"can you think  of nothing but ladies at such a time? Besides, why come to me in such a  matter? Flora is up the glen. Go and ask herself. And Cupid go with you!  But do not forget that my lovely sister, like her loving brother, is apt  to have a pretty strong will of her own!\"    Edward's heart beat as he went up the rocky hillside to find Flora. She  received and listened to him with kindness, but steadily refused to  grant him the least encouragement. All her thoughts, her hopes, her life  itself, were set on the success of this one bold stroke for a crown.  Till the rightful King was on his throne, she could not think of  anything else. Love and marriage were not for such as Flora Mac-Ivor.  Edward, in spite of the manifest good-will of the chief, had to be  content with such cold comfort as he could extract from Flora's promise  that she would remember him in her prayers!    Next morning Edward was awakened to the familiar sound of Daft Davie  Gellatley's voice singing below his window. For a moment he thought  himself back at Tully-Veolan. Davie was declaring loudly that            \"_My heart's in the Highland, my heart is not here._\"    Then, immediately changing to a less sentimental strain, he added with a  contemptuous accent:            \"_There's nocht in the Highlands but syboes and leeks,_           _And lang-leggit callants gaun wanting the breeks;_           _Wanting the breeks, and without hose or shoon,_           _But we'll a' win the breeks when King Jamie comes hame._\"    Edward, eager to know what had brought the Bradwardine \"innocent\" so far  from home, dressed hastily and went down. Davie, without stopping his  dancing for a moment, came whirling past, and, as he went, thrust a  letter into Waverley's hand. It proved to be from Rose Bradwardine, and  among other things it contained the news that the Baron had gone away to  the north with a body of horsemen, while the red soldiers had been at  Tully-Veolan searching for her father and also asking after Edward  himself. Indeed they had carried off his servant prisoner, together with  everything he had left at Tully-Veolan. Rose also warned him against the  danger of returning thither, and at the same time sent her compliments  to Fergus and Flora. The last words in the letter were, \"_Is she not as  handsome and accomplished as I described her to be?_\"    Edward was exceedingly perplexed. Knowing his innocence of all treason,  he could not imagine why he should be accused of it. He consulted  Fergus, who told him he would to a certainty be hanged or imprisoned if  he went south. Nevertheless, Edward persisted in \"running his hazard.\"  The Chief, though wishful to keep him, did not absolutely say him nay.  Flora, instead of coming down to bid him good-bye, sent only excuses. So  altogether it was in no happy frame of mind that Edward rode away to the  south upon the Chief's horse, Brown Dermid, and with Callum Beg for an  attendant in the guise of a Lowland groom.    Callum warned his master against saying anything when they got to the  first little Lowland town, either on the subject of the Highlands, or  about his master, Vich Ian Vohr.    \"The people there are bitter Whigs, teil burst them!\" he said fiercely.  As they rode on they saw many people about the street, chiefly old women  in tartan hoods and red cloaks, who seemed to cast up their hands in  horror at the sight of Waverley's horse. Edward asked the reason.    \"Oh,\" said Callum Beg, \"it's either the muckle Sunday hersel', or the  little government Sunday that they caa the Fast!\"    It proved to be the latter, and the innkeeper, a severe sly-looking man,  received them with scanty welcome. Indeed, he only admitted them because  he remembered that it was in his power to fine them for the crime of  travelling on a Fast Day by an addition to the length of his reckoning  next morning.    But as soon as Edward announced his wish for a horse and guide to Perth,  the hypocritical landlord made ready to go with him in person. Callum  Beg, excited by the golden guinea which Waverley gave him, offered to  show his gratitude by waiting a little distance along the road, and  \"kittlin' the landlord's quarters wi' her skene-occle\"--or, in other  words, setting a dagger in his back. Apparently Vich Ian Vohr's page  thought no more of such a deed than an ordinary English boy would have  thought of stealing an apple out of an orchard.      THE THIRD INTERLUDE--BEING MAINLY A FEW WORDS UPON HEROES        Among the listeners there was somewhat less      inclination than before to act this part of the      story. For one thing, the boys were righteously      indignant at the idea of any true hero being in      love--unless, indeed, he could carry off his"]]]
