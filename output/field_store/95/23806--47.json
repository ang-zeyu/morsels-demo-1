And  see, Theo, the rain has ceased and the sun come out.\"    \"I hadn't thought of the weather,\" smiled Theo. \"I had not thought of  anything, I guess, but what you were telling me. You will come again,  sir?\"    \"Surely!\"    \"And you won't forget your promise to tell me about English pottery?\"    \"No indeed, son,\" was the cordial reply. \"You are too good a listener  for me to forget.\"          [Illustration]          CHAPTER V    THE POTTER WHO BURNED HIS CHAIRS      It was not for some time that Mr. Croyden again had leisure for a  long talk with Theo, because with the return of pleasant weather he  and Dr. Swift went for a three days' canoe trip up Elk River, a small  stream emptying into the lake on which the camp stood. Dr. Swift had  thought of giving up this excursion, because it necessitated leaving  Theo for such a long time; but the boy was insistent that his father  should go.    \"I won't be lonesome, Father,\" he protested. \"Franz is here, and he  is as good as a vaudeville show; besides I can read, and whittle, and  write to Mother. The days will pass so quickly I shall not have time  to miss you. It would be too bad to have you stay in camp just for  me. I have made trouble enough already.\"    Perhaps it was because of Theo's genuine regret for what he had done  that Dr. Swift consented to carry out his original plan. The boy was  intensely sensitive, and any allusion to his accident, or any  interference with his father's pleasure because of it, immediately  brought a shadow of distress to his face. The Doctor was quick to  notice this fact; and eager, if possible, to avoid every reminder of  the disaster. Accordingly on hearing Theo's plea he packed his tackle,  and with a gentle word of caution to the invalid to be careful during  his absence, set forth with Mr. Croyden to fish Elk River.    It was no easy thing for Theo to play an unselfish part and see them  start off. How he wished that he, too, were going! But for his own  folly he might have gone. Well, he had no one to blame but himself,  that was certain. Therefore he put as brave a front on the matter as  he could, resolving to make the best of it and be cheerful.    It was not, however, much fun to be lying there in bed during those  fine spring days. From his window he could see the blue waters of the  lake between the aisles of straight pines. It was a glorious world if  one could only be abroad in it. Even the glimpse he had of it from  his bed was beautiful. But to lie still and look out upon this  alluring scene was not a satisfying role for an active boy. In spite  of the wood-carving, the books, the writing; even despite the time  Franz could spare to entertain him the hours dragged pitifully.  Furthermore, now that the severed bone had begun to knit he felt  restless and uncomfortable.    Hence when on the afternoon of the third day he awoke from an uneasy  doze to find his father standing beside him it was a joyful surprise.    \"Father!\" he cried.    \"Right here,\" came gruffly from the Doctor. \"Glad to have your old  dad home again?\"    \"Glad? Well, I guess!\"    \"I am glad to see you again too, son. I've thought of you a hundred  times. How did you get on?\"    \"All right, sir. Franz took fine care of me, and I found lots of  things to do,\" answered Theo bravely. \"But it is much nicer when you  are here than when you're not.\"    His father smiled.    \"You are a plucky youngster,\" he said huskily. \"No matter how silly  and childish your accident was you certainly have shown yourself a man  since. Look! Here comes Mr. Croyden to see you. He has brought you a  fine four-pounder, the record trout of the catch.\"    Theo beamed.    During the time the fishermen had been gone he had sadly missed the  delicacy of fresh fish.    \"Eating this trout will be the next best thing to pulling it in,  Theo,\" said Mr. Croyden. \"I only wish you might have had that  pleasure, too.\"    \"I shall be pretty glad to eat the trout, sir,\" Theo declared  promptly.    \"We shall let Franz get to work cooking it then, right away, so to  have it ready for your dinner,\" Dr. Swift said, passing out with the  fish in his hand.    After the Doctor had gone Theo looked up into Mr. Croyden's face.    \"I suppose you are dreadfully tired after your tramp,\" he remarked.    \"I? Oh, no,\" was the instant answer. \"Why?\"    \"I--I--don't know,\" faltered Theo. \"I just wondered.\"    \"Wondered what?\"    \"Whether after dinner you would be too tired to come in and talk to me  a little while?\"    \"No, indeed. I'd be glad to come,\" responded Mr. Croyden. \"I'll come  and tell you all about our trip.\"    \"If you don't mind I'd rather you'd leave that to Dad, and instead  tell me some more about china-making,\" Theo said naively.    Mr. Croyden seemed vastly amused at the remark.    \"Bless my soul! What a boy you are,\" he said. \"Of course I am  perfectly willing to talk to you on anything you like. Would you  rather hear about china than anything else?\"    \"Yes, sir, just now I should,\" came vigorously from Theo.    \"All righty, china it shall be, then! But I am surprised that you  should be so much interested in it. How came you to be so eager to  learn about pottery and porcelain?\"    \"I guess because you make it all so much like a story book,\" answered  Theo frankly. \"How did you happen to know so much about it, Mr.  Croyden?\"    \"Why, it chances to be my business, son,\" Mr. Croyden replied. \"In  Trenton, New Jersey, where I live, we make quantities of earthenware  and porcelain; more of it than anywhere else in the United  States. That is the way I earn my money to come on fishing trips.\"    \"Oh, I see! Then of course it is no wonder that you know all about  it!\" cried Theo.    \"I know some things, but not all,\" was Mr. Croyden's  answer. \"However, since you like to hear about it I am ready and glad  to tell you what I can. We will have a session on French pottery  to-night, if you say so; there are some things I want you to know  before we take up the making of the English wares.\"    \"Whatever you say!\" exclaimed Theo.    \"Very well. I'll be back after dinner, and unless your father wants  you for something else we'll have a nice evening together before your  bedtime.\"    Mr. Croyden was as good as his word.    Theo had just finished his share of the big trout when into his room  came the china merchant.    \"Your father and Manuel are busy icing some fish to ship home, so here  I am,\" he affirmed.    After dragging a steamer chair up to Theo's bedside and stretching  himself comfortably in it the elder man began:    \"Most of the pottery of the seventeenth century was an outgrowth of  the Italian Renaissance when all the arts such as painting,  wood-carving, sculpture, literature, glass and pottery-making were  revived. In France the attempt to imitate Italian Faenza ware gave  rise to the word _faience_, a term applied to French porcelains made  both from hard and soft paste. French potters at Nevers, spurred on by  Dutch and Chinese products, began to turn out a type of pottery not  unlike Delft, except that the method of coloring it was reversed, and  instead of having blue figures on a white ground it had white figures  on a background of blue. This innovation, however, was not an entirely  new variety of pottery. It still remained for France to invent its own  peculiar kind of ware, and this it soon did. Nevertheless you must not  make the mistake of thinking that these first attempts were very far  reaching, for on the contrary they were very limited. They are  significant only because they are the beginnings of that wonderful art  of porcelain-making which later the French carried to an amazing  degree of perfection.\"    There was a moment's delay in the story while Mr. Croyden rearranged  more comfortably the pillows behind Theo's head.    \"Is that better?\" he asked of the boy.    \"Lots better, thank you,\" said Theo gratefully.    \"All right, son. Then we'll go on. Two of the most important of these  beginnings are the Henri Deux ware, as it is called; and the enamel  work of Bernard Palissy.\"    \"We read about Palissy in school,\" put in Theo.    \"I am glad to hear that, for he was one of the three men whose names  have come down to us as being most vitally connected with pottery and  porcelain-making. But before we talk of him I am going to tell you  just a little about the Henri Deux ware, sometimes known as Faience  d'Orion. Very few pieces of it now remain; but for perfection of  workmanship and beauty of quality it has never been approached. Just  who made it we do not know; nor do we know anything of the conditions  under which it was manufactured. Only about fifty pieces of it are in  existence--half of them in England and half in France; and it is from  these, and from vague historic hints, that we have welded together the  rather uncertain tale that I am now to tell you.\"    A smile of anticipation passed over Theo's face.    \"Long ago there lived in France a wealthy woman named Helene  d'Hengest, who was deeply interested in all the arts, and who owned a  beautiful home known as Chateau d'Orion. Here she had a library, a  rather rare possession in those days, and a librarian called  Bernard. Now many persons think that it was this Bernard who was the  maker of the now famous Henri Deux ware, or Faience d'Orion.\"    \"Why should they think that?\" questioned Theo.    \"Well, there are several excellent reasons,\" Mr. Croyden  replied. \"One is that the ware shows traces of a book-binding  tool. Book-binders, you know, use many small instruments to decorate  or tool their leather. This faience was a ware of natural  cream-colored clay, and upon it was tooled a flat design the hollows  of which were filled in with darker clays that were afterward covered  with a lead glaze. Infinite care and pains had evidently been expended  upon each piece of the ware, such pains that it must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#8)"],[1,"found in England, its twelve decorated niches containing  figures of musicians. The musical instruments represented include the  cittern, bagpipe, hautboy, crowth, harp, trumpet, organ, guitar,  tambour, and cymbals, with two others which are uncertain. The tinted  figures of the angels, standing out against an orange-coloured  background--each in a separate niche with an elaborately carved  canopy--playing upon the various instruments, are admirably carved and  most graceful in form and arrangement. The two niches on either side of  the gallery contained figures of St. Mary and St. Peter; the niches are  supported by corbelled heads of Edward III and Queen Philippa. Edward  III created the Black Prince Duke of Cornwall in 1337, and made the city  of Exeter part of the duchy. \"The city,\" according to Izacke, \"being  held of the said duke, as parcel of the dutchy, by the fee farm rent of  twenty pounds per ann.\" To this connexion has been traced the erection  of the gallery, for such duchies \"were territorial realities,\" and the  prince would be received by minstrels chaunting in the gallery whenever  he paid a visit to his feudal dependency. It is asserted that it was  first used after the battle of Poictiers, when the Black Prince brought  with him to England, visiting Exeter _en route_ for London, the captured  French King. But Professor Freeman thinks the Duke did not pay a visit  to Exeter at that time, and that local tradition refers really to a  later date when \"he came home as a sick man\" not long before his death.    The lofty character of the clerestory above the gallery, and set  somewhat farther back, is remarkable. The tracery of all the windows is  of the best type of the fourteenth century and is unrivalled by that of  any other English cathedral of similar date. In their main features the  opposite windows are alike, though they vary in detail.    [Illustration: BAYS OF NAVE, WITH THE MINSTRELS' GALLERY                 (FROM BRITTON'S 'EXETER,' 1826).]    [Illustration: THE 'PATTESON' PULPIT.                 The Photochrom Co. Photo.]    #St. Radegunde's Chapel.#--On the south side of the main entrance and  within the thickness of the western wall is the chapel of St. Radegunde,  one of the most interesting in the cathedral. As early as 1220 a deed  belonging to the Chapter makes mention of this chapel \"within St.  Peter's cemetery,\" and is dated in the mayoralty of one Turbest and  attested by the then bishop, Simon de Apulia. Grandisson, in accordance  with the custom of his day, while completing the work of transforming  the cathedral, looked out for a suitable place of burial for himself. He  chose this chapel, and in 1350 the Fabric Rolls contain a reference to  the glazing of the windows and the better securing of them with nine  bars of iron. In accordance with a clause in his will, \"Corpus vero meum  volo quod sepeliatur extra ostium occidentale Ecclesiae Exon. ita  celeriter sicut fieri poterit,\" his remains were placed under the low  arch in the east of the chapel. Here they lay for many years, but in the  later years of Elizabeth, apparently without creating any public  indignation, his tomb was rifled and his ashes scattered to the \"four  winds.\" There seems to be no good reason why religious fanaticism should  have caused the tomb of so great and good a man to be despoiled. Two  interesting details are the carved figure of Christ on the roof and the  holes in the stones from which the lamps were formerly hung.    #St. Edmund's Chapel#, in the north-west corner of the nave, was part of  the Norman church, and was incorporated in his new work by Bishop  Grandisson. In it is a large font of modern Gothic style, presented in  the nineteenth century by Archdeacon Bartholomew.    #The Font.#--At the south-west side of the nave stands the  chalice-shaped font of white marble, purposely made in 1644 for the  baptism of Henrietta Anne, youngest child of Charles I, afterwards  Duchess of Orleans, who was born in Exeter during the Parliamentary  wars. The font is said to have been made in a fortnight, which may  account for the inferior character of the sculpture. But if not of  artistic merit, it is certainly of historic interest, and after being  set aside for some years, was replaced in its present position in 1891,  and is now always used for baptisms.    #The Patteson Pulpit# was placed in the nave in 1877. It is of Mansfield  stone, and is a beautiful example of modern sculpture. The panels  represent the Martyrdom of St. Alban, the embarkation of St. Boniface  and his companions for Germany, and the natives of Nukapu, Melanesia,  placing the body of Bishop Patteson in a canoe. The Martyred Bishop is  shown wrapped in a native mat, a relic still preserved in his family.      MONUMENTS IN THE NAVE    The great west window was filled with stained glass in 1904 in  commemoration of Dr. Temple, Bishop of Exeter 1869, of London 1885, and  in 1896 Archbishop of Canterbury. Figures in the lower lights represent  the most notable Bishops of Exeter from Leofric to Frederick Temple.    The monument under the west window commemorates services and losses of  the 1st Battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, which, as  the 32nd Regiment, greatly distinguished itself during the Sepoy revolt  in India in 1857-8.    On the north-west is a mural tablet with medallion portrait  commemorating Richard Blackmore, the author of _Lorna Doone_, 1825-1900.  The three lights of the small window above are filled with stained glass  in connexion with this memorial. The corresponding window on the south  side was filled with stained glass by Dean Cowie.    The largest monument in the north aisle is that to the memory of  officers and men of the 9th Lancers who fell during long and  distinguished service in India.    Farther on is a large brass, of no particular merit, to the memory of  the men of the 2nd Battalion of the North Devon Regiment who fell in the  Afghan War of 1880-81. It is surmounted by two regimental flags.    Above a mural tablet to Lieutenant G.A. Allen is a window of stained  glass erected to the memory of the 11th Earl of Devon. The colour scheme  is particularly good, and the design, representing Jacob's dream, is not  unsuccessful.    A plain tablet to the memory of Samuel Sebastian Wesley, the famous  musician, is the only other monument in the aisle of general interest.    In the same aisle have recently been placed the colours of those  battalions of the Devons who served in the great European War, 1914-18.    To complete the examination of the nave we must cross to the south  aisle, in the first bay of which is the ancient doorway, probably built  by Bishop Bruere, leading into the cloister. At the end of the aisle is  the monument of Colonel John Macdonald, who died in 1831, a son of the  celebrated Flora Macdonald. The most eastern window of the aisle is  filled with stained glass representing four bishops of the Courtenay  family. Peter Courtenay, Bishop of Exeter, will be recognized as he  holds the great \"Peter\" bell, his gift to the cathedral, which hangs in  the north tower. He is the bishop alluded to by Shakespeare (_Richard  III._, Act iv, Sc. 4):                       \"In Devonshire    Sir Edward Courtenay, and the haughty Prelate,    Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,    With many more confederates are in arms.\"    After the accession of Henry VII., he was translated to Winchester.    [Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING EAST.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    Formerly there was a Courtenay chantry in the last bay of this aisle,  corresponding with Bishop Brantyngham's chantry on the north side. These  became ruinous and were removed early in the nineteenth century. The  Courtenay tomb in the south transept is entirely a restoration. The  effigies represent Sir Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon, and Margaret  de Bohun, his wife. The great brass of their son, Sir Peter Courtenay,  also formerly in the chantry, is now in the south choir aisle: it has  been sadly injured by being trodden under foot for many hundred years,  and is now protected by matting. He was standard bearer to Edward III.  and Richard II., and one of the first Knights of the Garter.    The centre window of the south nave aisle is filled with stained glass  in memory of those of the Devon Regiment who served in the South African  War, 1899-1901. The tablets with their names are in St. Edmund's Chapel.  Their flags hang on either side of the window.    The large brass tablet, though, like too many of the memorials in the  nave, unnecessarily large and far from meritorious in design, is not  without interest. It is to the memory of Major-General Howard  Elphinstone, V.C., who was drowned off Ushant in 1890.    Above a tablet of brass to Hugh, 2nd Earl of Devon, and his wife, is a  window erected by Sir Edwin Watkin to the memory of Thomas Latimer. The  small window to the left, erected by Dean Cowie in memory of his wife,  should be noticed.    #North Transept.#--We have already seen that the two great towers of the  cathedral were in their nature transeptal from the beginning. But they  were quite separated from the body of the church, the arches connecting  them being filled in with strongly built masonry, forming a complete  wall. But Quivil, wishing to enlarge the interior of the building, took  down these walls, and he set about altering the arches and converting  them into the same Decorated style to match this work in the rest of the  building. He also altered and transformed the Norman chapels that  projected on the east side of each transept. In the north transept one  window and two narrow doorways still betray their Norman origin. The  open galleries in each transept are connected by a passage with the  clerestory. This, too, is Quivil's work, and his windows in the two  chapels of St. John and St. Paul, easily distinguishable by their  wheel-shape, are interesting.    Here is"]]]
