[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#8)"],[1,"to the shore in safety!  What more need be said in favour of the self-righting boats?    The self-emptying principle is quite equal to the self-righting in  importance.    In _every_ case of putting off to a wreck in a gale, a lifeboat ships a  great deal of water.  In most cases she fills more than once.  Frequently she is overwhelmed by tons of water by every sea.  A boat  full of water cannot advance, therefore baling becomes necessary; but  baling, besides being very exhausting work, is so slow that it would be  useless labour in most cases.  Besides, when men have to bale they  cannot give that undivided attention to the oars which is needful.  To  overcome this difficulty the self-emptying plan was devised.    As, I doubt not, the reader is now sufficiently interested to ask the  questions, How are self-righting and self-emptying accomplished?  I will  try to throw some light on these subjects.    First, as to self-righting.  You are aware, no doubt, that the buoyancy  of our lifeboat is due chiefly to large air-cases at the ends, and all  round the sides from stem to stern.  The accompanying drawing and  diagrams will aid us in the description.  On the opposite page you have  a portrait of, let us say, a thirty-three feet, ten-oared lifeboat, of  the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, on its transporting carriage,  ready for launching, and, on page 95, two diagrams representing  respectively a section and a deck view of the same (Figures 1, 2, and  3).    The breadth of this boat is eight feet; its stowage-room sufficient for  thirty passengers, besides its crew of twelve men--forty-two in all.  It  is double-banked; that is, each of its five banks, benches, or thwarts,  accommodates two rowers sitting side by side.  The lines festooned round  the side dip into the water, so that anyone swimming alongside may  easily grasp them, and in the middle part of the boat--just where the  large wheels come in the engraving--two of the lines are longer than the  others, so that a man might use them as stirrups, and thus be enabled to  clamber into the boat even without assistance.  The rudder descends  considerably below the keel--to give it more power--and has to be raised  when the boat is being launched.    The shaded parts of the diagrams show the position and form of the  air-cases which prevent a lifeboat from sinking.  The white oblong space  in Figure 2 is the free space available for crew and passengers.  In  Figure 3 is seen the depth to which the air-chambers descend, and the  height to which the bow and stern-chambers rise.    It is to these large air-chambers in bow and stern, coupled with great  sheer--or rise fore and aft--of gunwale, and a very heavy keel, that the  boat owes its self-righting power.  The two air-chambers are rounded on  the top.  Now, it is obvious that if you were to take a model of such a  boat, turn it upside down on a table, and try to make it rest on its two  _rounded_ air-chambers, you would encounter as much difficulty as did  the friends of Columbus when they sought to make an egg stand on its  end.  The boat would infallibly fall to one side or the other.  In the  water the tendency is precisely the same, and that tendency is increased  by the heavy iron keel, which drags the boat violently round to its  right position.    The self-righting principle was discovered--at all events for the first  time exhibited--at the end of last century, by the Reverend James  Bremner, of Orkney.  He first suggested in the year 1792 that an  ordinary boat might be made self-righting by placing two watertight  casks in the head and sternsheets of it, and fastening three  hundredweight of iron to the keel.  Afterwards he tried the experiment  at Leith, and with such success that in 1810 the Society of Arts voted  him a silver medal and twenty guineas.  But nothing further was done  until half a century later, when twenty out of twenty-four pilots lost  their lives by the upsetting of the non-self-righting Shields lifeboat.    Then (1850) the late Duke of Northumberland offered a prize of 100  guineas for the best lifeboat that could be produced.  No fewer than 280  models and drawings were sent in, and the plans, specifications, and  descriptions of these formed five folio manuscript volumes!  The various  models were in the shape of pontoons, catamarans or rafts, north-country  cobles, and ordinary boats, slightly modified.  The committee appointed  to decide on their respective merits had a difficult task to perform.  After six months' careful, patient investigation and experiment, they  awarded the prize to Mr James Beeching, of Great Yarmouth.  Beeching's  boat, although the best, was not, however, deemed perfect.    The committee therefore set Mr James Peake, one of their number, and  assistant master-shipwright at Woolwich Dockyard, to incorporate as many  as possible of the good qualities of all the other models with  Beeching's boat.  From time to time various important improvements have  been made, and the result is the present magnificent boat of the  Institution, by means of which hundreds of lives are saved every year.    The self-discharge of water from a lifeboat is not so easy to explain.  It will be the more readily comprehended if the reader understands, and  will bear in remembrance, the physical fact that water will, and must,  find its level.  That is--no portion of water, small or great, in tub,  pond, or sea, can for a moment remain above its flat and level surface,  except when forced into motion, or commotion.  Left to itself it  infallibly flattens out, becomes calm, lies still in the lowest  attainable position--in other words, finds its level.  Bearing this in  mind, let us look again at Figure 3.    The dotted double line about the middle of the boat, extending from stem  to stern, represents the _floor_ of the boat, on which the men's feet  rest when standing or sitting in it.  It also represents, or very nearly  so, the waterline outside, that is, the depth to which the boat will  sink when afloat, manned and loaded.  Therefore, the _boat's floor_ and  the _ocean_ _surface_ are on the same level.  Observe that!  The space  between the floor and the keel is filled up with cork or other ballast.  Now, there are six large holes in the boat's floor--each hole six inches  in diameter--into which are fitted six metal tubes, which pass down by  the side of the cork ballast, and right through the bottom of the boat  itself; thus making six large openings into the sea.    \"But hallo!\" you exclaim, \"won't the water from below rush up through  these holes and fill the boat?\"    It will indeed rush up into these holes, but it will not fill the boat  because it will have found its level--the level of ocean--on reaching  the floor.  Well, besides having reached its level, the water in the  tubes has reached six valves, which will open downwards to let water  out, but which won't open upwards to let it in.  Now, suppose a huge  billow topples into the boat and fills it quite full, is it not obvious  that all the water in the boat stands _above_ the ocean's level--being  above the boat's floor?  Like a wise element, it immediately seeks its  own level by the only mode of egress--the discharging tubes; and when it  has found its level, it has also found the floor of the boat.  In other  words, it is all gone! moreover, it rushes out so violently that a  lifeboat, filled to overflowing, frees itself, as I have already said,  in less than one minute!    The _buoyancy_, therefore, of a lifeboat is not affected for more than a  few seconds by the tons of water which occasionally and frequently break  into her.  To prove this, let me refer you again to the account of the  Constance, given by its gallant coxswain, as recorded in the third  chapter.  He speaks of the lifeboat being \"buried,\" \"sunk\" by the wave  that burst over the bow of the Stanley, and \"immediately,\" he adds, \"the  men made a grasp for the spare oars!\"  There is no such remark as \"when  we recovered ourselves,\" etcetera.  The sinking and leaping to the  surface were evidently the work of a few seconds; and this is indeed the  case, for when the force that sinks a lifeboat is removed, she rises  that instant to the surface like a cork, and when she tumbles over she  recovers herself with the agility of an acrobat!    The transporting-carriage is a most essential part of a lifeboat  establishment, because wrecks frequently take place at some distance  from a station, and prompt assistance is of the utmost importance in all  cases of rescue.  It is drawn by horses, and, with its exceedingly broad  and strong wheels, can be dragged over any kind of road or across soft  sand.  It is always backed into the surf so deep that the boat may be  launched from it, with her crew seated, and the oars out, ready to pull  with might and main the instant the plunge is made.  These first strokes  of a lifeboat's crew are of immense importance.  Want of union or energy  on the part of steersman or crew at this critical point may be fatal.  The boat must be made to cut the breakers end-on, so as to prevent her  turning broadside on and being rolled back on the beach.  Even after  these initial strokes have been made successfully, there still remains  the possibility of an unusually monstrous wave hurling the boat back end  over end.    The boat resting on its carriage on the sands (Figure 1) shows the  relative position of the two.  It will be seen, from that position, that  a very slight tip will suffice to cause the bow of the boat to drop  towards the sea.  As its keel rests on rollers, comparatively little  force is required to launch it.  Such force is applied by means of ropes  attached to the stern, passing through pulleys at the outer end of the  carriage, so that people on shore haul the ropes inland in order to  force the boat off its carriage seaward.    Once the boat has got fairly over the surf and out upon the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#8)"],[1," that it must have been  cut many years ago.    \"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"some ship or other has touched here long ago  for wood, and only taken one tree.\"    We did not think this likely, however, because, in such circumstances,  the crew of a ship would cut wood of small size and near the shore;  whereas this was a large tree, and stood near the top of the mountain.  In fact, it was the highest large tree on the mountain, all above it  being wood of very recent growth.    \"I can't understand it,\" said Jack, scratching the surface of the stump  with his axe.  \"I can only suppose that the savages have been here and  cut it for some purpose known only to themselves.  But, hallo! what have  we here?\"    As he spoke Jack began carefully to scrape away the moss and fungus from  the stump, and soon laid bare three distinct traces of marks, as if some  inscription or initials had been cut thereon.  But although the traces  were distinct, beyond all doubt, the exact form of the letters could not  be made out.  Jack thought they looked like JS, but we could not be  certain.  They had apparently been carelessly cut, and long exposure to  the weather had so broken them up that we could not make out what they  were.  We were exceedingly perplexed at this discovery, and stayed a  long time at the place conjecturing what these marks could have been,  but without avail; so, as the day was advancing, we left it, and quickly  reached the top of the mountain.    We found this to be the highest point of the island, and from it we saw  our kingdom lying, as it were, like a map around us.  As I have always  thought it impossible to get a thing properly into one's understanding  without comprehending it, I shall beg the reader's patience for a little  while I describe our island, thus, shortly:    It consisted of two mountains: the one we guessed at five hundred feet;  the other, on which we stood, at one thousand.  Between these lay a  rich, beautiful valley, as already said.  This valley crossed the island  from one end to the other, being high in the middle and sloping on each  side towards the sea.  The large mountain sloped, on the side farthest  from where we had been wrecked, gradually towards the sea; but although,  when viewed at a glance, it had thus a regular sloping appearance, a  more careful observation showed that it was broken up into a multitude  of very small vales--or, rather, dells and glens--intermingled with  little rugged spots and small but abrupt precipices here and there, with  rivulets tumbling over their edges and wandering down the slopes in  little white streams, sometimes glistening among the broad leaves of the  bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, or hiding altogether beneath the rich  underwood.  At the base of this mountain lay a narrow bright-green plain  or meadow, which terminated abruptly at the shore.  On the other side of  the island, whence we had come, stood the smaller hill, at the foot of  which diverged three valleys--one being that which we had ascended, with  a smaller vale on each side of it, and separated from it by the two  ridges before mentioned.  In these smaller valleys there were no  streams, but they were clothed with the same luxuriant vegetation.    The diameter of the island seemed to be about ten miles, and as it was  almost circular in form, its circumference must have been thirty miles--  perhaps a little more, if allowance be made for the numerous bays and  indentations of the shore.  The entire island was belted by a beach of  pure white sand, on which laved the gentle ripples of the lagoon.  We  now also observed that the coral reef completely encircled the island;  but it varied its distance from it here and there--in some places being  a mile from the beach, in others a few hundred yards, but the average  distance was half-a-mile.  The reef lay very low, and the spray of the  surf broke quite over it in many places.  This surf never ceased its  roar; for, however calm the weather might be, there is always a gentle  swaying motion in the great Pacific, which, although scarce noticeable  out at sea, reaches the shore at last in a huge billow.  The water  within the lagoon, as before said, was perfectly still.  There were  three narrow openings in the reef: one opposite each end of the valley  which I have described as crossing the island; the other opposite our  own valley, which we afterwards named the Valley of the Wreck.  At each  of these openings the reef rose into two small green islets, covered  with bushes, and having one or two cocoa-nut palms on each.  These  islets were very singular, and appeared as if planted expressly for the  purpose of marking the channel into the lagoon.  Our captain was making  for one of these openings the day we were wrecked--and would have  reached it, too, I doubt not, had not the rudder been torn away.  Within  the lagoon were several pretty, low coral islands, just opposite our  encampment; and immediately beyond these, out at sea, lay about a dozen  other islands, at various distances, from half-a-mile to ten miles--all  of them, as far as we could discern, smaller than ours and apparently  uninhabited.  They seemed to be low coral islands, raised but little  above the sea, yet covered with cocoa-nut trees.    All this we noted, and a great deal more, while we sat on the top of the  mountain.  After we had satisfied ourselves we prepared to return; but  here, again, we discovered traces of the presence of man.  These were a  pole or staff, and one or two pieces of wood which had been squared with  an axe.  All of these were, however, very much decayed, and they had  evidently not been touched for many years.    Full of these discoveries, we returned to our encampment.  On the way we  fell in with the traces of some four-footed animal, but whether old or  of recent date none of us were able to guess.  This also tended to raise  our hopes of obtaining some animal food on the island; so we reached  home in good spirits, quite prepared for supper, and highly satisfied  with our excursion.    After much discussion, in which Peterkin took the lead, we came to the  conclusion that the island was uninhabited, and went to bed.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    JACK'S INGENUITY--WE GET INTO DIFFICULTIES ABOUT FISHING, AND GET OUT OF  THEM BY A METHOD WHICH GIVES US A COLD BATH--HORRIBLE ENCOUNTER WITH A  SHARK.    For several days after the excursion related in the last chapter we did  not wander far from our encampment, but gave ourselves up to forming  plans for the future and making our present abode comfortable.    There were various causes that induced this state of comparative  inaction.  In the first place, although everything around us was so  delightful, and we could without difficulty obtain all that we required  for our bodily comfort, we did not quite like the idea of settling down  here for the rest of our lives, far away from our friends and our native  land.  To set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence  seemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and friends  for ever that we tacitly shrank from it, and put off our preparations,  for one reason and another, as long as we could.  Then there was a  little uncertainty still as to there being natives on the island, and we  entertained a kind of faint hope that a ship might come and take us off.  But as day after day passed, and neither savages nor ships appeared, we  gave up all hope of an early deliverance, and set diligently to work at  our homestead.    During this time, however, we had not been altogether idle.  We made  several experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut, most of which did not  improve it.  Then we removed our goods and took up our abode in the  cave, but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower.  Besides this, we bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal--at  least Jack and Peterkin did; I listened.  Among other useful things,  Jack, who was ever the most active and diligent, converted about three  inches of the hoop-iron into an excellent knife.  First, he beat it  quite flat with the axe; then he made a rude handle, and tied the  hoop-iron to it with our piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge on  a piece of sandstone.  When it was finished he used it to shape a better  handle, to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchief--in  which operation he had, as Peterkin pointed out, torn off one of Lord  Nelson's noses.  However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by  Peterkin as a fishing-line.  He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end  of it.  This the fish were allowed to swallow, and then they were pulled  quickly ashore.  But as the line was very short and we had no boat, the  fish we caught were exceedingly small.    One day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been angling, and  said in a very cross tone, \"I'll tell you what, Jack, I'm not going to  be humbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer.  I want  you to swim out with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!\"    \"Dear me, Peterkin!\" replied Jack; \"I had no idea you were taking the  thing so much to heart, else I would have got you out of that difficulty  long ago.  Let me see;\" and Jack looked down at a piece of timber, on  which he had been labouring, with a peculiar gaze of abstraction which  he always assumed when trying to invent or discover anything.    \"What say you to building a boat?\" he inquired, looking up hastily.    \"Take far too long,\" was the reply; \"can't be bothered waiting.  I want  to begin at once!\"    Again Jack considered.  \"I have it!\" he cried.  \"We'll fell a large tree  and launch the trunk of it in the water, so that when you want to fish  you've nothing to do but to swim out to it.\"    \"Would not a small raft do better?\" said I.    \"Much better; but we have no ropes to bind it together with.  Perhaps we  may find something hereafter that will do as well, but in"]]]
