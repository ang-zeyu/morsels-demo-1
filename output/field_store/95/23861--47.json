CHAPTER III    CUVIER      Cuvier was perhaps the greatest of comparative anatomists; his work  is, in the best sense of the word, classical.    Like all his predecessors, like Aristotle, like the Italian  anatomists, Cuvier studied structure and function together, even gave  function the primacy.    Some functions, he says,[41] are common to all organised bodies--origin  by generation, growth by nutrition, end by death. There are also  secondary functions. Of these the most important, in animals at least,  are the faculties of feeling and moving. These two faculties are  necessarily bound up together; if Nature has given animals sensation  she must also have given them the power of movement, the power to flee  from what is harmful and draw near to what is good. These two  faculties determine all the others. A creature that feels and moves  requires a stomach to carry food in. Food requires instruments to  divide it, liquids to digest it. Plants, which do not feel and do not  move, have no need of a stomach, but have roots instead. Thus the  \"Animal Functions\" of feeling and moving determine the character of  the organs of the second order, the organs of digestion. These in  their turn are prior to the organs of circulation, which are a means  to the end of distributing the nutrient fluid or blood to all parts of  the body. These organs of the third order are not only dependent on  those of the second order, but are also not even necessary, for many  animals are without them. Only animals with a circulatory system can  have definite breathing organs--lungs or gills. Plants, and animals  without a circulation, breathe by their whole surface.    There is accordingly a rational order of functions, and therefore of  the systems of organs which perform them. The most important are the  Animal Functions, with their great organ-system, the neuro-muscular  mechanism. Then come the digestive functions, and after them, and in a  sense accessory to them, the functions and organs of circulation and  respiration. The last three may be grouped as the Vital Functions.    The Animal Functions not only determine the character of the Vital  Functions, but influence also the primary faculty of generation, for  animals' power of movement has rendered their mode of fecundation more  simple, has therefore had an effect on their organs of generation.    This division into \"Animal\" and \"Vital\" functions recalls Buffon's and  Bichat's distinction of the \"animal\" and the \"vegetative\" lives.  Cuvier apparently took this idea from Buffon, for he says that a plant  is an animal that sleeps.[42] But the idea is as old as Aristotle, who  discusses the \"sleep\" of embryos and of plants in the last book of the  _De Generatione animalium_. The distinction between animal and  vegetative life is, of course, based for Aristotle in the difference  between the [Greek: psyche aisthetike] and the [Greek: psyche  threptike]. Cuvier, like Aristotle, Buffon, and Bichat, makes the  heart the centre of the \"vegetative\" organs.    It is important to note that Cuvier puts function before structure,  and infers from function what the organ will be. \"Plants,\" he writes,  \"having few faculties, have a very simple organisation.\"[43] It is only  after having discussed and classified functions that Cuvier goes on to  examine organs.    First his views on the composition of the animal body. Aristotle  distinguished three degrees of composition--the \"elements,\" the  homogeneous parts, and the heterogeneous parts or organs. Cuvier does  the same. Some small advance has been made in the two thousand years'  interval, due in the first place to the progress of chemistry, and in  the second to the invention of the microscope. To the first  circumstance Cuvier owes his knowledge that the inorganic substances  forming the first degree of composition are principally C, N, H, O,  and P, combined to form albumen, fibrine, and the like, which are in  their turn combined to form the solids and fluids of the body. To the  latter circumstance Cuvier owes the statement that the finest  fragments into which mechanical division can resolve the organism are  little flakes and filaments, which, joined up loosely together, form a  \"cellulosity.\" The discovery of the true cellular nature of animal  tissues did not come till much later, till some years after Cuvier's  death in 1832. Knowledge of histological detail was, however,  considerable by the beginning of the 19th century. Cuvier knew, for  example, that each muscle fibre has its own nerve fibre. But he gives  no elaborate account of the homogeneous parts, no detailed histology.  On the other hand his treatment of the heterogeneous parts or organs  is detailed and masterly.[44]    The main systems of organs are, in order of importance, the nervous  and muscular, the digestive, the circulatory, and the respiratory.  Each organ or system of organs may have many forms. If any form of any  organ could exist in combination with any form of all the others there  would be an enormous number of combinations theoretically possible.  But these combinations do not all exist in Nature, for organs are not  merely assembled (_rapproche's_), but act upon one another, and act  all together for a common end. Accordingly only the combinations that  fulfil these conditions exist in Nature. Cuvier thus dismisses the  question of a science of possible organic forms and considers only the  forms or combinations actually existing. This question of the  possibility of a \"theoretical\" morphology of living things, after the  fashion of the morphology of crystals with their sixteen possible  types, was raised in later years by K. G. Carus, Bronn, and Haeckel.    Organisms, then, are harmonious combinations of organs, and the  harmony is primarily a harmony of functions. Every function depends  upon every other, and all are necessary. The harmony of organs and  their mutual dependence are the results of the interdependence of  function. This thought, the recognition of the functional unity of the  organism, is the fundamental one at the base of all Cuvier's work.  Before him men had recognised more or less clearly the harmony of  structure and function, and had based much of their work upon this  unanalysed assumption. Cuvier was the first naturalist to raise this  thought to the level of a principle peculiar to natural history. \"It  is on this mutual dependence of the functions and the assistance which  they lend one to another that are founded the laws that determine the  relations of their organs; these laws are as inevitable as the laws of  metaphysics and mathematics, for it is evident that a proper harmony  between organs that act one upon another is a necessary condition of  the existence of the being to which they belong.\"[45]    This rational principle, peculiar to natural history, Cuvier calls the  principle of the conditions of existence, for the following  reason:--\"Since nothing can exist that does not fulfil the conditions  which render its existence possible, the different parts of each being  must be co-ordinated in such a way as to render possible the existence  of the being as a whole, not only in itself, but also in its relations  with other beings, and the analysis of these conditions often leads to  general laws which are as certain as those which are derived from  calculation or from experiment.\"[46]    By \"conditions of existence\" he means something quite different from  what is now commonly understood. The idea of the external conditions  of existence, the environment, enters very little into his thought. He  is intent on the adaptations of function and organ within the living  creature--a point of view rather neglected nowadays, but essential for  the understanding of living things. The very condition of existence of  a living thing, and part of the essential definition of it, is that  its parts work together for the good of the whole.    The principle of the adaptedness of parts may be used as an  explanatory principle, enabling the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#8)"],[1,"antislavery platform Susan had heard so much, and Abby Kelley  Foster, whose appointment to office in the American Antislavery  Society had precipitated a split in the ranks on the \"woman question.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A year later, when Abby Kelley Foster and her husband Stephen spoke at  antislavery meetings in Rochester, Susan had her first opportunity to  meet this fearless woman. Listening to Abby's speeches and watching  the play of emotion on her eager Irish face under the Quaker bonnet,  Susan wondered if she would ever have the courage to follow her  example. Like herself, Abby had started as a schoolteacher, but after  hearing Theodore Weld speak, had devoted herself to the antislavery  cause, traveling alone through the country to say her word against  slavery and facing not only the antagonism which abolition always  provoked, but the unreasoning prejudice against public speaking by  women, which was fanned into flame by the clergy. For listening to  Abby Kelley, men and women had been excommunicated. Mobs had jeered at  her and often pelted her with rotten eggs. She had married a  fellow-abolitionist, Stephen Foster, even more unrelenting than she.    Sensing Susan's interest in the antislavery cause and hoping to make  an active worker of her, Abby and Stephen suggested that she join them  on a week's tour, during which she marveled at Abby's ability to hold  the attention and meet the arguments of her unfriendly audiences and  wondered if she could ever be moved to such eloquence.    Not yet ready to join the ranks as a lecturer, she continued her  apprenticeship by attending antislavery meetings whenever possible and  traveled to Syracuse for the convention which the mob had driven out  of New York. Eager for more, she stopped over in Seneca Falls to hear  William Lloyd Garrison and the English abolitionist, George Thompson,  and was the guest of a temperance colleague, Amelia Bloomer, an  enterprising young woman who was editing a temperance paper for women,  _The Lily_.    To her surprise Susan found Amelia in the bloomer costume about which  she had read in _The Lily_. Introduced in Seneca Falls by Elizabeth  Smith Miller, the costume, because of its comfort, had so intrigued  Amelia that she had advocated it in her paper and it had been dubbed  with her name. Looking at Amelia's long full trousers, showing beneath  her short skirt but modestly covering every inch of her leg, Susan was  a bit startled. Yet she could understand the usefulness of the costume  even if she had no desire to wear it herself. In fact she was more  than ever pleased with her new gray delaine dress with its long full  skirt.    Seneca Falls, however, had an attraction for Susan far greater than  either William Lloyd Garrison or Amelia Bloomer, for it was the home  of Elizabeth Cady Stanton whom she had longed to meet ever since 1848  when her parents had reported so enthusiastically about her and the  Rochester woman's rights convention. Walking home from the antislavery  meeting with Mrs. Bloomer, Susan met Mrs. Stanton. She liked her at  once and later called at her home. They discussed abolition,  temperance, and woman's rights, and with every word Susan's interest  grew. Mrs. Stanton's interest in woman's rights and her forthright,  clear thinking made an instant appeal. Never before had Susan had such  a satisfactory conversation with another woman, and she thought her  beautiful. Mrs. Stanton's deep blue eyes with their mischievous  twinkle, her rosy cheeks and short dark hair gave her a very youthful  appearance, and it was hard for Susan to realize she was the mother of  three lively boys.    Susan listened enthralled while Mrs. Stanton told how deeply she had  been moved as a child by the pitiful stories of the women who came to  her father's law office, begging for relief from the unjust property  laws which turned over their inheritance and their earnings to their  husbands. For the first time, Susan heard the story of the exclusion  of women delegates from the World's antislavery convention in London,  in 1840, which Mrs. Stanton had attended with her husband and where  she became the devoted friend of Lucretia Mott. She now better  understood why these two women had called the first woman's rights  convention in 1848 at which Mrs. Stanton had made the first public  demand for woman suffrage.    [Illustration: Elizabeth Cady Stanton in her \"Bloomer costume\"]    They talked about the bloomer costume which Mrs. Stanton now wore and  about dress reform which at the moment seemed to Mrs. Stanton an  important phase of the woman's rights movement, and she pointed out to  Susan the advantages of the bloomer in the life of a busy housekeeper  who ran up and down stairs carrying babies, lamps, and buckets of  water. She praised the freedom it gave from uncomfortable stays and  tight lacing, confident it would be a big factor in improving the  health of women.    Thoroughly interested, Susan left Seneca Falls with much to think  about, but not yet converted to the bloomer costume, or even to woman  suffrage. Of one thing, however, she was certain. She wanted this  woman of vision and courage for her friend.      FOOTNOTES:    [21] Anthony Collection, Museum of Arts and Sciences, Rochester, New  York.

FREEDOM TO SPEAK      Susan was soon rejoicing at the prospect of meeting Lucy Stone and  Horace Greeley, the editor of the New York _Tribune_. Mrs. Stanton had  invited her to Seneca Falls to discuss with them and other influential  men and women the founding of a people's college. Unhesitatingly she  joined forces with Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone to insist that the  people's college be opened to women on the same terms as men. Lucy had  proved the practicability of this as a student at Oberlin, the first  college to admit women, and was one of the first women to receive a  college degree. However, to suggest coeducation in those days was  enough to jeopardize the founding of a college, and Horace Greeley  stood out against them, his babylike face, fringed with throat  whiskers, getting redder by the moment as he begged them not to  agitate the question.    The people's college did not materialize, but out of this meeting grew  a friendship between Susan, Elizabeth Stanton, and Lucy Stone, which  developed the woman's rights movement in the United States. Susan  discovered at once that Lucy, like Mrs. Stanton, was an ardent  advocate of woman's rights. Brought up in a large family on a farm in  western Massachusetts where a woman's lot was an unending round of  hard work with no rights over her children or property, Lucy had seen  much to make her rebellious. Resolving to free herself from this  bondage, she had worked hard for an education, finally reaching  Oberlin College. Here she held out for equal rights in education, and  now as she went through the country, pleading for the abolition of  slavery, she was not only putting into practice woman's right to  express herself on public affairs, but was scattering woman's rights  doctrine wherever she went. Listening to this rosy-cheeked,  enthusiastic young woman with her little snub nose and soulful gray  eyes, Susan began to realize how little opposition in comparison she  herself had met because she was a woman. Not only had her father  encouraged her to become a teacher, but he had actually aroused her  interest in such causes as abolition, temperance, and woman's rights,  while both Lucy and Mrs. Stanton had met disapproval and resistance  all the way.    [Illustration: Lucy Stone]    She found Lucy, as well as Mrs. Stanton, in the bloomer dress,  praising its convenience. As Lucy traveled about lecturing, in all  kinds of weather, climbing on trains, into carriages, and walking on  muddy streets, she found it much more practical and comfortable than  the fashionable long full skirts. Nevertheless, there was discomfort  in being stared at on the streets and in the chagrin of her friends.  This reform was much on their minds and they discussed it pro and con,  for Mrs. Stanton was facing real persecution in Seneca Falls, with  boys screaming \"breeches\" at her when she appeared in the street and  with her husband's political opponents ridiculing her costume in their  campaign speeches. Both women, however, felt it their duty to bear  this cross to free women from the bondage of cumbersome clothing,  hoping always that the bloomer, because of its utility, would win  converts and finally become the fashion. Susan admired their courage,  but still could not be persuaded to put on the bloomer.    Fired with their zeal, she began planning what she herself might do  to rouse women. The idea of a separate woman's rights movement did not  as yet enter her mind. Her thoughts turned rather to the two national  reform movements already well under way, temperance and antislavery.  While a career as an antislavery worker appealed strongly to her, she  felt unqualified when she measured herself with the courageous Grimke  sisters from South Carolina, or with Abby Kelley Foster, Lucy Stone,  and the"]]]
