And when, at last, the dinner  was ready to be served, they came tumbling in with the dishes, heels  over head, one after the other, so that one half of the feast was spread  upon the ground, and the other half deposited out of doors, on the other  side of the lodge.    After a while, however, by strict discipline, and threatening to cut off  their provisions, the bear-servants were brought into tolerable control.    Yet Grasshopper, with his ever restless disposition, was uneasy; and,  having done so many wonderful things, he resolved upon a strict and  thorough reform in all the affairs of the village. To prevent future  difficulty, he determined to adopt new regulations between the bears and  their masters.    With this view, he issued an edict that henceforward the bears should  eat at the first table, and that the Indians were to wait upon them;  that in all public processions of an honorable character the bears  should go first; and that when any fighting was to be done, the Indians  should have the privilege reserved of receiving the first shots. A  special exemption was made in behalf of Grasshopper's favorite and  confidential adviser, the Pipe-bearer (who had been very busy in  private, recommending the new order of things), who was to be allowed to  sit at the head of the feast, and to stay at home with the old women in  the event of battle.    Having seen his orders strictly enforced, and the rights of the bears  over the Indians fairly established, Grasshopper fixed his mind upon  further adventures. He determined to go abroad for a time, and having an  old score to settle with Manabozho, he set out with a hope of soon  falling in with that famous giant. Grasshopper was a blood relation of  Dais Imid, or He of the Little Shell, and had heard of what had passed  between that giant and his kinsman.    After wandering a long time he came to the lodge of Manabozho, who was  absent. He thought he must play him a trick; and so he turned every  thing in the lodge upside down, and killed his birds, of which there was  an extraordinary attendance, for Manabozho is master of the fowls of the  air, and this was the appointed morning for them to call and pay their  court to him. Among the number was a raven, accounted the meanest of  birds, which Grasshopper killed and hung up by the neck, to insult him.    He then went on till he came to a very high point of rocks running out  into the lake, from the top of which he could see the country, back as  far as the eye could reach. While sitting there, Manabozho's mountain  chickens flew around and past him in great numbers. Out of mere spite to  their master, Grasshopper shot them by the score, for his arrows were  very sure and the birds very plenty, and he amused himself by throwing  the birds down the rocks. At length a wary bird cried out:    \"Grasshopper is killing us; go and tell our father.\"    Away sped a delegation of the birds which were the quickest of wing, and  Manabozho soon made his appearance on the plain below. Grasshopper, who,  when he is in the wrong, is no match for Manabozho, made his escape on  the other side. Manabozho, who had in two or three strides reached the  top of the mountain, cried out:    \"You are a rogue. The earth is not so large but I can get up to you.\"    Off ran Grasshopper and Manabozho after him. The race was sharp; and  such leaps and strides as they made! Over hills and prairies, with all  his speed, went Grasshopper, and Manabozho hard upon him. Grasshopper  had some mischievous notions still left in his head which he thought  might befriend him. He knew that Manabozho was under a spell to restore  whatever he, Grasshopper, destroyed. Forthwith he stopped and climbed a  large pine-tree, stripped off its beautiful green foliage, threw it to  the winds, and then went on.    When Manabozho reached the spot, the tree addressed him: \"Great chief,\"  said the tree, \"will you give my life again? Grasshopper has killed  me.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Manabozho, who, as quickly as he could, gathered the  scattered leaves and branches, renewed its beauty with his breath, and  set off. Although Grasshopper in the same way compelled Manabozho to  lose time in repairing the hemlock, the sycamore, cedar, and many other  trees, the giant did not falter, but pushing briskly forward, was fast  overtaking him, when Grasshopper happened to see an elk. And asking him,  for old acquaintance' sake, to take him on his back, the elk did so, and  for some time he made good headway, but still Manabozho was in sight.    He was fast gaining upon him, when Grasshopper threw himself off the  elk's back; and striking a great sandstone rock near the path, he broke  it into pieces, and scattered the grains in a thousand directions; for  this was nearly his last hope of escape. Manabozho was so close upon him  at this place that he had almost caught him; but the foundation of the  rock cried out,    \"Haye! Ne-me-sho, Grasshopper has spoiled me. Will you not restore me to  life?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Manabozho. He re-established the rock in all its  strength.    He then pushed on in pursuit, and had got so near to Grasshopper as to  put out his arm to seize him; but Grasshopper dodged him, and, as his  last chance, he immediately raised such a dust and commotion by  whirlwinds, as made the trees break and the sand and leaves dance in the  air. Again and again Manabozho stretched his arm, but he escaped him at  every turn, and kept up such a tumult of dust that he dashed into a  hollow tree which had been blown down, changed himself into a snake, and  crept out at the roots just in time to save his life; for at that moment  Manabozho, who had the power of lightning, struck it, and it was strewn  about in little pieces.    Again Grasshopper was in human shape, and Manabozho was pressing him  hard. At a distance he saw a very high bluff of rocks jutting out into a  lake, and he ran for the foot of the precipice which was abrupt and  elevated. As he came near, to his surprise and great relief, the Manito  of the rock opened his door and told Grasshopper to come in. The door  was no sooner closed than Manabozho knocked.    \"Open it!\" he cried, with a loud voice. The Manito was afraid of him;  but he said to Grasshopper, \"Since I have taken you as my guest, I would  sooner die with you than open the door.\"    \"Open it!\" Manabozho again cried, in a louder voice than before.    The Manito kept silent. Manabozho, however, made no attempt to open it  by force. He waited a few moments.    \"Very well,\" he said; \"I give you till morning to live.\"    Grasshopper trembled, for he thought his last hour had come; but the  Manito bade him to be of good cheer.    When the night came on the clouds were thick and black, and as they were  torn open by the lightning, such discharges of thunder were never heard  as bellowed forth. The clouds advanced slowly and wrapped the earth  about with their vast shadows as in a huge cloak. All night long the  clouds gathered, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder roared, and  above all could be heard Manabozho muttering vengeance upon poor little  Grasshopper.    \"You have led a very foolish kind of life, Grasshopper,\" said his friend  the Manito.    \"I know it--I know it!\" Grasshopper answered.    \"You had great gifts of strength awarded to you,\" said the Manito.    \"I am aware of it,\" replied Grasshopper.    \"Instead of employing it for useful purposes, and for the good of your  fellow-creatures, you have done nothing since you became a man but raise  whirlwinds on the highways, leap over trees, break whatever you met in  pieces, and perform a thousand idle pranks.\"    Grasshopper, with great penitence, confessed that his friend the Manito  spoke but too truly; and at last his entertainer, with a still more  serious manner, said:    \"Grasshopper, you still have your gift of strength. Dedicate it to the  good of mankind. Lay all of these wanton and vain-glorious notions out  of your head. In a word, be as good as you are strong.\"    \"I will,\" answered Grasshopper. \"My heart is changed; I see the error of  my ways.\"    Black and stormy as it had been all night, when morning came the sun was  shining, the air was soft and sweet as the summer down and the blown  rose; and afar off upon the side of a mountain sat Manabozho, his head  upon his knees, languid and cast down in spirit. His power was gone, for  now Grasshopper was in the right, and he could touch him no more.    With many thanks, Grasshopper left the good Manito, taking the nearest  way home to his own people.    As he passed on, he fell in with an old man who was wandering about the  country in search of some place which he could not find. As soon as he  learned his difficulty, Grasshopper, placing the old man upon his back,  hurried away, and in a short hour's dispatch of foot set him down among  his own kindred, of whom he had been in quest.    Loosing no time, Grasshopper next came to an open plain, where a small  number of men stood at bay, and on the very point of being borne down  by great odds, in a force of armed warriors, fierce of aspect and of  prodigious strength. When Grasshopper saw this unequal struggle, rushing  forward he seized a long bare pole, and, wielding it with his whole  force, he drove the fierce warriors back; and, laying about him on every  hand, he soon sent them a thousand ways in great haste, and in a very  sore plight.    Without tarrying to receive the thanks of those to whom he had brought  this timely relief, he made his utmost speed, and by the close of the  afternoon he had come in sight of his own village. What were his  surprise and horror, as he approached nearer, to discover the bears in  excellent case and flesh, seated at lazy leisure in the trees, looking  idly on while his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],[0,"\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#8)"],[1," jay from Boston as wanted to build a summerhaouse, an' he  got a heap for it. Well, them two loonies scratched along till, one  day, Penn's church he'd belonged to--the Moravians--found out where he  wuz drifted an' layin', an' wrote to Uncle Salters. 'Never heerd what  they said exactly; but Uncle Salters was mad. He's a 'piscopalian  mostly--but he jest let 'em hev it both sides o' the bow, 'sif he was a  Baptist, an' sez he warn't goin' to give up Penn to any blame Moravian  connection in Pennsylvania or anywheres else. Then he come to dad,  towin' Penn,--thet was two trips back,--an' sez he an' Penn must fish a  trip fer their health. 'Guess he thought the Moravians wouldn't hunt  the Banks fer Jacob Boller. Dad was agreeable, fer Uncle Salters he'd  been fishin' off an' on fer thirty years, when he warn't inventin'  patent manures, an' he took quarter-share in the 'We're Here'; an' the  trip done Penn so much good, dad made a habit o' takin' him. Some day,  dad sez, he'll remember his wife an' kids an' Johnstown, an' then,  like's not, he'll die, dad sez. Don't yer talk about Johnstown ner such  things to Penn, 'r Uncle Salters he'll heave ye overboard.\"    \"Poor Penn!\" murmured Harvey. \"I shouldn't ever have thought Uncle  Salters cared for him by the look of 'em together.\"    \"I like Penn, though; we all do,\" said Dan. \"We ought to ha' give him a  tow, but I wanted to tell ye first.\"    They were close to the schooner now, the other boats a little behind  them.    \"You needn't heave in the dories till after dinner,\" said Troop, from  the deck. \"We'll dress-daown right off. Fix table, boys!\"    \"Deeper'n the Whale-deep,\" said Dan, with a wink, as he set the gear  for dressing-down. \"Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin'.  They're all waitin' on dad. See 'em, Harve?\"    \"They are all alike to me.\" And, indeed, to a landsman the nodding  schooners around seemed run from the same mould.    \"They ain't, though. That yaller, dirty packet with her bowsprit  steeved that way, she's the 'Hope of Prague'. Nick Brady's her skipper,  the meanest man on the Banks. We'll tell him so when we strike the Main  Ledge. 'Way off yander's the 'Day's Eye'. The two Jeraulds own her.  She's from Harwich; fastish, too, an' hez good luck; but dad he'd find  fish in a graveyard. Them other three, side along, they're the 'Margie  Smith', 'Rose', and 'Edith S. Walen', all frum home. 'Guess we'll see  the 'Abbie M. Deering' to-morrer, dad, won't we? They're all slippin'  over from the shoal o' 'Queereau.\"    \"You won't see many boats to-morrow, Danny.\" When Troop called his son  Danny, it was a sign that the old man was pleased. \"Boys, we're too  crowded,\" he went on, addressing the crew as they clambered inboard.  \"We'll leave 'em to bait big an' catch small.\" He looked at the catch  in the pen, and it was curious to see how little and level the fish  ran. Save for Harvey's halibut, there was nothing over fifteen pounds  on deck.    \"I'm waitin' on the weather,\" he added.    \"Ye'll have to make it yourself, Disko, for there's no sign I can see,\"  said Long Jack, sweeping the clear horizon.    And yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing-down, the Bank fog  dropped on them, \"between fish and fish,\" as they say. It drove  steadily and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless  water. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and  Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began  to heave up the anchor, the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable  strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last.  The anchor came up with a sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop  steadied her at the wheel. \"Up jib and foresail,\" said he.    \"Slip 'em in the smother,\" shouted Long Jack, making fast the  jib-sheet, while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the  foresail; and the fore-boom creaked as the \"We're Here\" looked up into  the wind and dived off into blank, whirling white.    \"There's wind behind this fog,\" said Troop.    It was all wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful  part was that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop,  ending with, \"That's good, my son!\"    \"'Never seen anchor weighed before?\" said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping  at the damp canvas of the foresail.    \"No. Where are we going?\"    \"Fish and make berth, as you'll find out 'fore you've bin a week  aboard. It's all new to you, but we never know what may come to us.  Now, take me--Tom Platt--I'd never ha' thought--\"    \"It's better than fourteen dollars a month an' a bullet in your belly,\"  said Troop, from the wheel. \"Ease your jumbo a grind.\"    \"Dollars an' cents better,\" returned the man-o'-war's man, doing  something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. \"But we didn't  think o' that when we manned the windlass-brakes on the 'Miss Jim  Buck',[1] outside Beaufort Harbor, with Fort Macon heavin' hot shot at  our stern, an' a livin' gale atop of all. Where was you then, Disko?\"    \"Jest here, or hereabouts,\" Disko replied, \"earnin' my bread on the  deep waters, and dodgin' Reb privateers. 'Sorry I can't accommodate you  with red-hot shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we'll come aout all right on  wind 'fore we see Eastern Point.\"    There was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by  a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the  fo'c'sle. The rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along  the lee of the house--all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the  main-hatch nursing his stung hands.      [1] The Gemsbok, U. S. N.?      \"'Guess she'd carry stays'l,\" said Disko, rolling one eye at his  brother.    \"Guess she wouldn't to any sorter profit. What's the sense o' wastin'  canvas?\" the farmer-sailor replied.    The wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko's hands. A few seconds  later a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote  Uncle Salters between the shoulders, and drenched him from head to  foot. He rose sputtering, and went forward, only to catch another.    \"See dad chase him, all around the deck,\" said Dan. \"Uncle Salters he  thinks his quarter-share's our canvas. Dad's put this duckin' act up on  him two trips runnin'. Hi! That found him where he feeds.\" Uncle  Salters had taken refuge by the foremast, but a wave slapped him over  the knees. Disko's face was as blank as the circle of the wheel.    \"'Guess she'd lie easier under stays'l, Salters,\" said Disko, as though  he had seen nothing.    \"Set your old kite, then,\" roared the victim, through a cloud of spray;  \"only don't lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right  off an' git your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum  araound on deck this weather.\"    \"Now they'll swill coffee an' play checkers till the cows come home,\"  said Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore-cabin. \"'Looks to  me like's if we'd all be doin' so fer a spell. There's nothin' in  creation deader-limpsey-idler'n a Banker when she ain't on fish.\"    \"I'm glad ye spoke, Danny,\" cried Long Jack, who had been casting round  in search of amusement. \"I'd clean forgot we'd a passenger under that  T-wharf hat. There's no idleness for thim that don't know their ropes.  Pass him along, Tom Platt, an' we'll l'arn him.\"    \"'Tain't my trick this time,\" grinned Dan. \"You've got to go it alone.  Dad learned me with a rope's end.\"    For an hour Long Jack walked his prey up and down, teaching, as he  said, \"things at the sea that ivry man must know, blind, dhrunk, or  asleep.\" There is not much gear to a seventy-ton schooner with a  stump-foremast, but Long Jack had a gift of expression. When he wished  to draw Harvey's attention to the peak-halyards, he dug his knuckles  into the back of the boy's neck and kept him at gaze for half a minute.  He emphasised the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing  Harvey's nose along a few feet of the boom, and the lead of each rope  was fixed in Harvey's mind by the end of the rope itself.    The lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free; but  there appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a  man. Forward lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp  cables, all very unpleasant to trip over; the fo'c'sle stovepipe, and  the gurry-butts by the fo'c'sle-hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of  these the fore-boom and booby of the main-hatch took all the space that  was not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came the nests of  dories lashed to ring-bolts by the quarter-deck; the house, with tubs  and oddments lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot main-boom  in its crutch, splitting things lengthwise, to duck and dodge under  every time.    Tom Platt, of course, could not keep his oar out of the business, but  ranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails  and spars on the old Ohio.    \"Niver mind fwhat he says; attind to me, Innocince. Tom Platt, this  bally-hoo's not the Ohio, an' you're mixing the bhoy bad.\"    \"He'll be ruined for life, beginnin' on a fore-an'-after this way,\" Tom  Platt pleaded. \"Give him a chance to know a few leadin' principles.  Sailin's an art, Harvey, as I'd show you if I had ye in the foretop o'  the--\"    \"I know ut. Ye'd talk him dead an' cowld. Silince, Tom Platt! Now,  after all I've said, how'd you reef the foresail, Harve'? Take your  time answerin'.\"    \"Haul that in,\" said Harvey, pointing to leeward.    \"Fwhat? The North Atlantuc?\"    \"No, the boom. Then run that rope you showed me back there--\"    \"That's no way,\" Tom Platt burst in.    \"Quiet! He's l'arnin', an' has not the names good yet. Go on, Harve.\"    \"Oh, it's the reef-pennant. I'd hook the tackle on to the reef-pennant,  and then let down--\"    \"Lower the sail, child! Lower!\" said Tom Platt, in a professional agony.    \"Lower the throat-and peak-halyards,\" Harvey went on."]]]
