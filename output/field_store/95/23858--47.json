Your Excellency will seek an interview with the Reis Effendi, and,  having read to him this despatch, leave a copy of it, with an  accurate translation in his hands.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 16.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Stratford Canning_.    Sir,                         _Foreign Office, January_ 16, 1844.    With reference to my other despatch of this day upon the subject of  the execution of the Greek near Brussa as an apostate from Islamism,  I inclose, for your Excellency's information, an extract of so much  of a despatch from M. Guizot to Count Ste. Aulaire as relates to  this matter, which Count Ste. Aulaire communicated to me a few days  ago.    Your Excellency will perceive from this paper that M. Guizot  anticipates that Her Majesty's Government will be disposed to invite  the co-operation of the other Great Powers with the view of making a  simultaneous appeal to the Porte on that subject. But although Her  Majesty's Government would certainly be glad to see the other Powers  of Europe declaring their abhorrence of so revolting a system as  that against which your Excellency and your French colleague will be  instructed to protest, they consider it, nevertheless, unnecessary  formally to solicit their co-operation in a matter in which they all  may be supposed to take a common interest, and to be prepared to act  without previous concert with each other.    I have however directed Her Majesty's Ambassador at Paris to  communicate to M. Guizot a copy of my other despatch of this day;  and I should wish your Excellency to concert with M. de Bourqueney  as to the manner in which the instructions which I have addressed to  your Excellency and those which M. de Bourqueney will receive from  his Court on this matter, and which I conclude will closely  correspond with those addressed to yourself, shall be carried into  execution so as to produce a salutary impression on the Porte.    A copy of my former instruction will be transmitted to Her Majesty's  Ambassador at St. Petersburgh for communication to the Russian  Government; but Lord Stuart de Rothsay will not be instructed, for  the reason stated in this despatch, to invite the Russian Government  to make a similar representation to the Porte.    I inclose a copy of my despatch to Lord Stuart de Rothsay. A  corresponding despatch will be addressed to Sir Robert Gordon and to  Lord Westmorland.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 17.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Lord Cowley_.    My Lord,                     _Foreign Office, January_ 16, 1844.    I inclose, for your Excellency's information, a copy of a despatch  from M, Guizot which has been placed in my hands by the Count de  Ste. Aulaire, expressive of the just indignation of the French  Government on receiving the tidings that, notwithstanding the  representations which were made to the Porte by the Five Powers on  the occasion of the execution of the Armenian at Constantinople in  September last, a Greek has now been put to death near Brussa for  returning to Christianity after having embraced Islamism. This event  had been already made known to Her Majesty's Government by a  despatch from Sir Stratford Canning of which I herewith transmit a  copy.    The Government of the Queen share entirely the feelings of  indignation and disgust which the French Government evince on this  occasion; and I have consequently instructed Her Majesty's  Ambassador at the Porte to make a fresh and more energetic  representation than before to the Turkish Government, in  condemnation of this repeated act of barbarity.    I inclose a copy of this instruction to Sir Stratford Canning, and  also of a further one of the same date, in which I direct his  Excellency to concert with the Baron de Bourqueney in carrying that  instruction into effect.    Your Excellency will communicate these instructions to M. Guizot.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 18.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Lord Cowley_.    My Lord,                     _Foreign Office, January_ 16, 1844.    With reference to my other despatch of this day, inclosing, for  communication to M. Guizot, a copy of an instruction which I have  addressed to Sir Stratford Canning respecting the execution of a  Greek near Brussa who had apostatized from Islamism, I have to state  to your Excellency that, in the event of your making the  communication to M. Guizot in sufficient time to enable him to send  his instructions to the French Minister at Constantinople by the  steam-vessel which leaves Marseilles on the 21st of this month, the  post for which is made up in Paris on the evening of the 18th, I  should wish your Excellency to acquaint Sir Stratford Canning by  that opportunity with what may have passed between you and M.  Guizot.    The despatch will be sent this evening by post through France so as  to go on by the Marseilles steam-vessel of the 21st.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 19.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Lord Stuart de Rothsay_*.    My Lord,                     _Foreign Office, January_ 16, 1844.    I inclose for your Excellency's information, a copy of a despatch  from Sir Stratford Canning reporting that a Greek has been executed  near Brussa as an apostate from Islamism; and a copy of an  instruction which I have in consequence addressed to that  Ambassador. Your Excellency will communicate this instruction to  Count Nesselrode for the information of the Russian Government; but  although Her Majesty's Government would doubtless see with pleasure  that the other Powers of Europe should declare their abhorrence of  so revolting a system as that which the Porte has twice acted upon  within the last few months, they do not think it necessary formally  to solicit their co-operation in a matter in which they all may be  supposed to take a common interest, and to be prepared to act  without previous concert with each other.    Your Excellency will therefore merely put Count Nesselrode in  possession of the instructions given to Sir Stratford Canning, and  leave to the Russian Government to determine for itself whether it  shall instruct M. de Titow to the same effect.    I am, &c.,    * A similar despatch was addressed on the 20th January to Sir Robert  Gordon and the Earl of Westmorland.    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 20.      _Lord Cowley to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received January_ 22.)    My Lord,                          _Paris, January_ 19, 1844.    With reference to your Lordship's despatches of the 16th instant on  the subject of the execution of a Greek for returning to  Christianity after having embraced Islamism, I have the honour to  report that I had yesterday evening an interview with M. Guizot,  when I communicated to him the contents of those despatches, and  also of your Lordship's instructions to Sir Stratford Canning in  consequence of the aforesaid transaction; and I have now the honour  to inclose a copy of the despatch which, conformably to your  Lordship's instructions, I have addressed to Sir Stratford Canning  informing him of what passed upon this subject between M. Guizot and  me.    My despatch was forwarded last night to Her Majesty's Ambassador at  Constantinople, and will reach Marseilles in time to go by the  steam-vessel which sails from that port on the 21st.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) COWLEY.    Inclosure in No. 20.    _Lord Cowley to Sir Stratford Canning_.    Sir,                              _Paris, January_ 18, 1844.    I have received instructions from Lord Aberdeen to communicate to  the French Minister for Foreign Affairs your Excellency's despatches  to his Lordship respecting the execution of a Greek near Brussa who  had apostatized from Islamism, as also his instructions to your  Excellency, under date the 16th instant, in consequence of that  transaction. I am also desired to take the earliest opportunity of  acquainting you with what may have passed between M. Guizot and me  after this communication.    I had this evening a conference with the Minister for Foreign  Affairs, when I communicated to him the contents of your despatches  upon this subject, and also Lord Aberdeen's instructions to you of  the 16th instant, and I am happy to be enabled to state that M.  Guizot expressed his entire approbation of those instructions.    He also assured me that he had signified to M. de Bourqueney, in  terms not less strong than those used by Lord Aberdeen in his  instructions to you, the indignation and disgust of the French  Government at this transaction, affording as it did a painful  testimony of the total disregard of the Porte to the remonstrances  of the Allies upon a previous act of a similar kind.    The Minister for Foreign Affairs then assured me that he had  directed M. de Bourqueney to consult with your Excellency as to the  best manner of carrying into effect the instructions of the two  Governments. The Representatives of France at St. Petersburgh,  Vienna, and Berlin, have likewise been directed to bring the subject  under the consideration of those Courts; but M. Guizot inclines to  the opinion that a separate, rather than joint, representation to  the Turkish Government would be advisable. He trusts, however, that  the British and French Plenipotentiaries will act in concert upon  this occasion, as they have done successfully in every other  transaction at Constantinople in which the Allies have taken any  interest.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) COWLEY.              No. 21.      _The Earl of Westmorland to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  January_ 30.)    My Lord,                          _Berlin, January_ 24, 1844.    In compliance with the directions contained in your Lordship's  despatch of the 20th instant, I have communicated to Baron Bülow  your instructions to Sir Stratford Canning relative to the late  execution of a Greek at Brussa. Baron Bülow gave me an instruction  to read addressed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2040"],[0,"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (#8)"],[1,"be unconsciously approaching each other  through the darkness; in which case, said I--supposing I, instead of  being (as indeed I am) little better than an outcast--       Lord of my learning, and no land beside--    were, like my friend Lord ---, heir by general repute to 70,000 pounds  per annum, what a panic should I be under at this moment about my throat!  Indeed, it was not likely that Lord --- should ever be in my situation.  But nevertheless, the spirit of the remark remains true--that vast power  and possessions make a man shamefully afraid of dying; and I am convinced  that many of the most intrepid adventurers, who, by fortunately being  poor, enjoy the full use of their natural courage, would, if at the very  instant of going into action news were brought to them that they had  unexpectedly succeeded to an estate in England of 50,000 pounds a-year,  feel their dislike to bullets considerably sharpened, {6} and their  efforts at perfect equanimity and self-possession proportionably  difficult.  So true it is, in the language of a wise man whose own  experience had made him acquainted with both fortunes, that riches are  better fitted       To slacken virtue, and abate her edge,     Than tempt her to do ought may merit praise.       _Paradise Regained_.    I dally with my subject because, to myself, the remembrance of these  times is profoundly interesting.  But my reader shall not have any  further cause to complain, for I now hasten to its close.  In the road  between Slough and Eton I fell asleep, and just as the morning began to  dawn I was awakened by the voice of a man standing over me and surveying  me.  I know not what he was: he was an ill-looking fellow, but not  therefore of necessity an ill-meaning fellow; or, if he were, I suppose  he thought that no person sleeping out-of-doors in winter could be worth  robbing.  In which conclusion, however, as it regarded myself, I beg to  assure him, if he should be among my readers, that he was mistaken.  After  a slight remark he passed on; and I was not sorry at his disturbance, as  it enabled me to pass through Eton before people were generally up.  The  night had been heavy and lowering, but towards the morning it had changed  to a slight frost, and the ground and the trees were now covered with  rime.  I slipped through Eton unobserved; washed myself, and as far as  possible adjusted my dress, at a little public-house in Windsor; and  about eight o'clock went down towards Pote's.  On my road I met some  junior boys, of whom I made inquiries.  An Etonian is always a gentleman;  and, in spite of my shabby habiliments, they answered me civilly.  My  friend Lord --- was gone to the University of ---.  \"Ibi omnis effusus  labor!\"  I had, however, other friends at Eton; but it is not to all that  wear that name in prosperity that a man is willing to present himself in  distress.  On recollecting myself, however, I asked for the Earl of D---,  to whom (though my acquaintance with him was not so intimate as with some  others) I should not have shrunk from presenting myself under any  circumstances.  He was still at Eton, though I believe on the wing for  Cambridge.  I called, was received kindly, and asked to breakfast.    Here let me stop for a moment to check my reader from any erroneous  conclusions.  Because I have had occasion incidentally to speak of  various patrician friends, it must not be supposed that I have myself any  pretension to rank and high blood.  I thank God that I have not.  I am  the son of a plain English merchant, esteemed during his life for his  great integrity, and strongly attached to literary pursuits (indeed, he  was himself, anonymously, an author).  If he had lived it was expected  that he would have been very rich; but dying prematurely, he left no more  than about 30,000 pounds amongst seven different claimants.  My mother I  may mention with honour, as still more highly gifted; for though  unpretending to the name and honours of a _literary_ woman, I shall  presume to call her (what many literary women are not) an _intellectual_  woman; and I believe that if ever her letters should be collected and  published, they would be thought generally to exhibit as much strong and  masculine sense, delivered in as pure \"mother English,\" racy and fresh  with idiomatic graces, as any in our language--hardly excepting those of  Lady M. W. Montague.  These are my honours of descent, I have no other;  and I have thanked God sincerely that I have not, because, in my  judgment, a station which raises a man too eminently above the level of  his fellow-creatures is not the most favourable to moral or to  intellectual qualities.    Lord D--- placed before me a most magnificent breakfast.  It was really  so; but in my eyes it seemed trebly magnificent, from being the first  regular meal, the first \"good man's table,\" that I had sate down to for  months.  Strange to say, however, I could scarce eat anything.  On the  day when I first received my 10 pound bank-note I had gone to a baker's  shop and bought a couple of rolls; this very shop I had two months or six  weeks before surveyed with an eagerness of desire which it was almost  humiliating to me to recollect.  I remembered the story about Otway, and  feared that there might be danger in eating too rapidly.  But I had no  need for alarm; my appetite was quite sunk, and I became sick before I  had eaten half of what I had bought.  This effect from eating what  approached to a meal I continued to feel for weeks; or, when I did not  experience any nausea, part of what I ate was rejected, sometimes with  acidity, sometimes immediately and without any acidity.  On the present  occasion, at Lord D-'s table, I found myself not at all better than  usual, and in the midst of luxuries I had no appetite.  I had, however,  unfortunately, at all times a craving for wine; I explained my situation,  therefore, to Lord D---, and gave him a short account of my late  sufferings, at which he expressed great compassion, and called for wine.  This gave me a momentary relief and pleasure; and on all occasions when I  had an opportunity I never failed to drink wine, which I worshipped then  as I have since worshipped opium.  I am convinced, however, that this  indulgence in wine contributed to strengthen my malady, for the tone of  my stomach was apparently quite sunk, and by a better regimen it might  sooner, and perhaps effectually, have been revived.  I hope that it was  not from this love of wine that I lingered in the neighbourhood of my  Eton friends; I persuaded myself then that it was from reluctance to ask  of Lord D---, on whom I was conscious I had not sufficient claims, the  particular service in quest of which I had come down to Eton.  I was,  however unwilling to lose my journey, and--I asked it.  Lord D---, whose  good nature was unbounded, and which, in regard to myself, had been  measured rather by his compassion perhaps for my condition, and his  knowledge of my intimacy with some of his relatives, than by an  over-rigorous inquiry into the extent of my own direct claims, faltered,  nevertheless, at this request.  He acknowledged that he did not like to  have any dealings with money-lenders, and feared lest such a transaction  might come to the ears of his connexions.  Moreover, he doubted whether  _his_ signature, whose expectations were so much more bounded than those  of ---, would avail with my unchristian friends.  However, he did not  wish, as it seemed, to mortify me by an absolute refusal; for after a  little consideration he promised, under certain conditions which he  pointed out, to give his security.  Lord D--- was at this time not  eighteen years of age; but I have often doubted, on recollecting since  the good sense and prudence which on this occasion he mingled with so  much urbanity of manner (an urbanity which in him wore the grace of  youthful sincerity), whether any statesman--the oldest and the most  accomplished in diplomacy--could have acquitted himself better under the  same circumstances.  Most people, indeed, cannot be addressed on such a  business without surveying you with looks as austere and unpropitious as  those of a Saracen's head.    Recomforted by this promise, which was not quite equal to the best but  far above the worst that I had pictured to myself as possible, I returned  in a Windsor coach to London three days after I had quitted it.  And now  I come to the end of my story.  The Jews did not approve of Lord D---'s  terms; whether they would in the end have acceded to them, and were only  seeking time for making due inquiries, I know not; but many delays were  made, time passed on, the small fragment of my bank-note had just melted  away, and before any conclusion could have been put to the business I  must have relapsed into my former state of wretchedness.  Suddenly,  however, at this crisis, an opening was made, almost by accident, for  reconciliation with my friends; I quitted London in haste for a remote  part of England; after some time I proceeded to the university, and it  was not until many months had passed away that I had it in my power again  to revisit the ground which had become so interesting to me, and to this  day remains so, as the chief scene of my youthful sufferings.    Meantime, what had become of poor Ann?  For her I have reserved my  concluding words.  According to our agreement, I sought her daily, and  waited for her every night, so long as I stayed in London, at the corner  of Titchfield Street.  I inquired for her of every one who was likely to  know her, and during the last hours of my stay in London I put into  activity every means of tracing her that my knowledge of London suggested  and the limited extent of my power made possible.  The street where she  had lodged I knew, but not the house; and I remembered at last some  account which she had given me of ill-treatment from her landlord, which  made it probable that "]]]
