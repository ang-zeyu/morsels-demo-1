Only at the very end of its life,  when the border has completely eclipsed the initial, is the idea of  origin forgotten. Then, indeed, we find the border treillages of  flower-stem or leaf-work starting from meaningless points of the design,  or scattered shapelessly at random.    When we meet with work of this sort, we need no further proof that the  real art is dead. We have before us in such a performance--a trade  production--a mere object of commerce, valuable so far as it is the  result of labour, but not as a work of art.    According to the Abbé Geoghegan,[11] Christianity was known to the people  of Ireland in the fourth century. The Greek Menology asserts that it was  carried thither by Simon Zelotes, but this is contradicted by the Roman  Breviary and the Martyrologists. Simeon Metaphrastes attributes it to  St. Peter, Vincent of Beauvais to St. James. Unreliable as these  traditions may be taken singly, they nevertheless agree in placing the  conversion of Ireland at a very early date, probably, as Geoghegan says,  in the fourth century. It is certain that about the middle of the sixth  century an Irish prince of distinguished ancestry, and himself a saint,  led a band of missionaries from Donegal to Iona. It is curious to  observe that the event is almost contemporary with the renovations of  Justinian at Byzantium, and only a short time before the founding of the  famous Abbey of Monte Cassino by St. Benedict. Before the existence of  the Benedictine Order there was a monastery at Durrow, in Ireland, and  in this monastery the aforesaid prince was educated. His name was  Columba. At least, so he is called, but whether it be merely in allusion  to his mission--\"the Dove\"--or really a patronymic, it is hard to say.  He was the messenger of peace to the natives of Iona, and even the name  of the island seems to suggest an allusion to the Old Testament  missionary to the Ninevites, Jonah. The Irish missionaries called the  spot to which they went _I. columcille_, \"the cell of the Dove's isle,\"  or Columba's cell. It is usually spoken of as the Monastery of Iona.  Columba went on many other missions, but ultimately returned to his  beloved Iona, where he died in 597, the year after the arrival of  Augustine at Canterbury.    [11] _Hist. de l'Irlande._    His companions busied themselves with the transcription of the Gospels  for the use of new converts, after the model of those they had seen and  used at Durrow. It is even traditionally asserted that Columba himself  took part in the work, and transcribed both a Psalter and a Gospel-book,  moreover, that one of the Iona Gospel-books written by him is still in  existence. This MS., whether the work of St. Columba or not, and  probably it is not, is the earliest known monument of Irish calligraphic  art. It is known as the Book of Kells, and there is no doubt that it is  the most amazing specimen of penmanship ever seen. It is at once the  most ancient, the most perfect, and the most precious example of Celtic  art in existence. It exhibits the striking peculiarities and features of  the style--the band work knots and interlacings, such as may be seen on  the stone crosses which mark the burial-places of British and Irish  chieftains. Witness, for instance, the Carew, or the Nevern Cross,  described in the _Journal of the Archoelogical Institute_, iii. 71, which  might be taken to represent an initial \"I\" wrought in stone. There is no  foliage, no plant form at all. It is not, therefore, derivable from  Romanesque, Byzantine, or Oriental ornament. It is indigenous, if not to  Ireland, at least to those prehistoric Aryan tribes of which the Irish  were a branch. Its basis is the art of weaving, and in some respects  resembles the matting of Polynesia much more closely that the vine-stems  of Sicily or the arabesques of Byzantium. Spirals occur that bewilder  the eye, yet are so faultlessly perfect that only the magnifying-glass  brings out the incredible accuracy of the drawing. Among them are  mythological and allegorical beasts, snakes, and lizards--thought to  represent demons, like the gargoyles of Gothic architecture--in every  conceivable attitude of contortion and agony. There are also doves and  fishes, but the latter, being sacred emblems together with the lamb, are  seldom made grotesque. It was a monkish legend that the devil could take  the shape of any bird or beast, except those of the dove and the lamb.          CHAPTER VII    CELTIC ILLUMINATION--_continued_    The Iona Gospels--Contrast with Roman and Byzantine--Details--Treatment  of animal forms--Colour schemes--The Gospel-book of St. Columbanus--That  of Mael Brith Mac Durnan--The Lindisfarne Gospels--_Cumdachs_--Other  book-shrines.      We have seen that in both Roman and Byzantine MSS. the titles and  beginnings of books were merely distinguished by a lettering in red or  gold, rather smaller, in fact, than the ordinary text, but rendered  distinct by the means referred to. The handwriting, too, is clear and  legible, whether capital, uncial, or minuscule.    In absolute contrast to all this the Iona Gospels have the first page  completely covered with ornament. On the next the letters are of an  enormous size, followed by a few words, not merely in _uncials_, but in  characters varying from half an inch to two inches in height. The page  opposite to each Gospel is similarly filled with decoration, separated  into four compartments by an ornamented Greek cross. This may, of  course, be simply a geometrical device in no way connected with Greece,  but, taken in connection with other features, we see in it an indication  of contact with Byzantine work and the side of illumination which deals  rather with the tabular enrichment of the page than the development of  the initial. Further, the writing, though large, is not easily legible,  for it is involved, enclaved, and conjointed in a manner sufficiently  puzzling to those who see it for the first time.    The plaiting and inlaying are certainly borrowed from local usages, and  the survival of the same kind of interlaced plaiting in the Scottish  tartans is some evidence of the long familiarity of the Celtic race with  the art of weaving. When we remember that some of the early illuminators  were also workers in metals, we can understand that penmen like Dagæus,  Dunstan, and Eloy had designs at their command producible by either  method. So we see, both in the MS. and in the brooch and buckle, the  same kind of design. Among the earliest animals brought into this Celtic  work we find the dog and the dragon; the latter both wingless and  winged, according to convenience or requirement. The dog is so common in  some of the Celto-Lombardic MS., of which examples still exist at Monte  Cassino, as almost to create a style; while the dragon survives to the  latest period of Gothic art.    Whatever is introduced into a Celtic illumination is at once treated as  a matter of ornament. When the human figure appears it is remorselessly  subjected to the same rules as the rest of the work; the hair and beard  are spiral coils, the eyes, nostrils, and limbs are symmetrical  flourishes. Colour is quite regardless of natural possibility. The hair  and draperies are simply patterned as compartments of green or blue, or  red or black, as may be required for the _tout ensemble_; the face  remains white. Lightened tints are preferred to full colours, as pale  yellow, pink, lavender, and light green. A very ludicrous device is made  use of to denote the folds of the drapery; they are not darkened, there  is no light and shade in Celtic work, but are simply lines of a strongly  contrasting colour. The blue and red appear to be opaque, and therefore  mineral colours; the rest are thin and transparent. Nothing can be more  wayward than the colouring of the symbolic beasts of the Gospels. In the  Evangeliary of St. Columbanus (not Columba, but the founder of Luxeuil  and Bobbio, who died in 614) the Lion of St. Mark is an admirable beast  in a suit of green-and-red chain armour in the form of mascles or  lozenges. (See the illustration in Westwood's _Palæographia Sacra  Pictoria_ of a figure page from the Gospels of Mael Brith Mac Durnan for  a typical example.)[12]    [12] See also an article by Westwood in _Journal Archæol. Inst._, vii.  17, on \"Irish Miniatures.\"    The only point that might argue the freedom in Celtic work from  Byzantine influence is the absence of gold, but perhaps this was only  because the earlier Irish illuminators could not obtain it; we find it  later on. In the Book of Kells and the Lambeth Gospels there is no gold.  The former dates somewhere in the seventh century, not the sixth, as  sometimes stated; the latter, shortly before 927. In the Lindisfarne  Gospels (698-721) gold is used. In the Psalter of Ricemarchus, now in  Trinity College, Dublin, are traces of silver. It is in connection with  these Irish MSS. that decorated and jewelled cases, called _cumdachs_,  make their appearance, such as the one attached to the Gospels of St.  Moling in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. These book-shrines are  almost exclusively an Irish production. In other countries the idea was  to adorn the volume itself with a splendid and costly binding, perhaps  including gold, silver, and gems. In Ireland the idea of sacredness was  carried out in another way. Instead of decorating the covers of the book  itself, it was held, as in such a MS., for instance, as the Book of  Durrow, to be too venerable a relic to be meddled with, and a box or  case was made for it, on which they spent all their artistic skill.  Generally the case is known as a _cumdach_; but one kind, called the  _cathach_, was so closed that the book was completely concealed, and it  was superstitiously believed that if it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#8)"],[1,"tion; hence  sneezing, coughing, etc., as the air then acts as an irritant.    At no time do we breathe pure oxygen, but \"air\"--_i.e._, a mixture of  21 parts of the former with 79 parts of an inert gas, nitrogen; and  there is always in the air more oxygen than the blood actually takes  from it in the air-cells.    The intaking of air is termed by physiologists _inspiration_, and its  expulsion _expiration_, the whole process being _respiration_.  Expiration takes a very little longer than inspiration, and the  rapidity of respiration depends on the needs of the body. The more  active the exercise, the more rapidly vital processes go on, the more  ventilation of the tissues is required and the more is actually  effected. When one is at rest breathing takes place at the rate of  from 14 to 18 inspirations and expirations in the minute; but of all  the processes of the body none is more variable than respiration,  and of necessity, for every modification of action, every movement,  implies a demand for an increased quantity of oxygen. It is not  surprising, therefore, that the very exercise of singing tends in  itself to put one out of breath.    [Illustration: FIG. 12. In the above, the shaded outlines indicate the  shape of the bony cage of the chest during inspiration, and the  lighter ones the same during expiration. The alterations in the  position of the ribs and in the diameters of the chest, giving rise to  its greater capacity during inspiration, are evident.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13. This figure is intended to indicate, in a  purely diagrammatic way, by dotted lines, the position of the  diaphragm (1) when inspiration is moderate, and (2) when very deep.  The unbroken curved line above the dotted ones indicates the position  of the diaphragm (only approximately, of course) after expiration.]    Attention will now be directed to some facts that it is of the utmost  importance to clearly understand, if one is to know how to breathe and  the reasons for the method employed. The lungs are contained in a  cavity the walls of which are made up of a domed muscular (and  tendinous) structure below, and elsewhere of bony and cartilaginous  tissues filled in with soft structures, chiefly muscles. This cage is  lined within by a smooth membrane which is kept constantly moist by  its own secretion. The lungs are covered by a similar membrane, both  of these fitting closely like the hand to a glove, so that there are  two smooth membranes in opposition. It cannot be too well remembered  that these two, the inner surface of the chest walls and the outer  surface of the lungs, are in the closest contact. This is so whatever  the changes that take place in the size and shape of the chest. The  lungs are concave below, and so fit accurately to the fleshy partition  between the chest and the abdomen which constitutes the lower boundary  of the chest, if we may use the term \"chest\" somewhat loosely. Above,  suiting the shape of the chest, the lungs are somewhat conical.    The pressure of the air tends of itself to expand the lungs, which are  highly elastic, even when one does not breathe at all. But if more  air is to enter there must be additional space provided; hence greater  expansion of the lungs can only follow an enlargement of the chest  cavity in one or in all directions. These are spoken of as  _diameters_. It follows that it is possible to conceive of the chest  being enlarged in three, and only three, directions; so that it may be  increased in size in its vertical, its transverse, and its  antero-posterior diameter, or diameter from before backwards.    This expansion, as in the case of all other movements, can be effected  only by muscles, or, to speak more accurately, by neuro-muscular  mechanisms. Exactly what muscles are employed may be learned from the  accompanying illustrations and by observation. While it is highly  important to know in a general way which muscles are chiefly  concerned, or, rather, where they are situated, it cannot be deemed  essential for every reader to learn their names, attachments, etc.,  down to the minutest details, as in the case of a student of anatomy  proper. The author does, however, deem it of the highest importance  that the student should learn by actual observation on his own person  that his chest does expand in each of the three directions indicated  above.    It is not necessary to dissect to observe muscles; in fact, they can  be seen in action only on the living subject. All who would really  understand breathing should study the chest when divested of all  clothing and before a sufficiently large mirror. He may then observe  the following during a fairly deep inspiration:    1. The chest is enlarged as a whole.    2. The abdominal walls move outward.    3. The ribs pass from a more oblique to a less oblique position, and  may become almost horizontal; their upper edges are also turned out  slightly, though this is not so easy to observe.    4. Again, in the case of a very deep and sudden inspiration, the  abdomen and the lower ribs also are drawn inward.    The changes above referred to are brought about in this way:    1. The total enlargement is due to the action of many muscles which  function in harmony with each other.    2. The chief changes are brought about by those muscles attached  between the ribs (_intercostales_); but these act more efficiently  owing to the cooeperation of other muscles which steady the ribs and  chest generally, such as those attached to the shoulder-bones and the  upper ribs; indeed, the most powerful inspiration possible can only be  effected when most of the other muscles of the body are brought into  action. One may observe that even the arms and legs are called into  requisition when a tenor sings his highest tone as forcibly as  possible, though this is often overdone in a way to be condemned. Art  should not be reduced to a gymnastic feat.    The most important muscle of inspiration is the _diaphragm_, or  midriff, because it produces a greater change in the size of the chest  than any other single muscle. Some animals can get the oxygen they  require to maintain life by the action of this large muscle alone,  when all other respiratory muscles are paralyzed. As it is so  important, and above all to the voice-user, it merits special  consideration.    In studying the action of a muscle it is necessary to note its _points  of attachment_ to harder structures, either bone or cartilage. Nearly  always one such point is more fixed than the other, and from this the  muscle pulls when it contracts.    The diaphragm is peculiar in that it is somewhat circular in shape and  is more or less tendinous or sinew-like in the middle. Being attached  to the spinal column behind and to the lower six or seven ribs, when  the muscle contracts it becomes less domed in shape--less convex  upward--and of course descends to a variable degree depending on the  extent of the muscular contraction. As to whether the ribs, and with  them the abdominal muscles, are drawn in or the reverse, is determined  wholly by the degree of force with which the contraction takes place  and the extent to which it is resisted. Throughout the body muscles  are arranged in sets which may either cooeperate with or antagonize  each other, as required. The forcible bending of one's arm by another  person may be resisted by one through the use of certain muscles. In  this the action of the muscles which bend the arm is imitated by the  agent seeking to perform this movement for us. The muscles acting in  opposition to certain others are said to be their _antagonists_.    Were the diaphragm to contract moderately the ribs would be but little  drawn in, even if no muscles acted as antagonists. But, as a matter of  fact, this domed muscle descends at the same time as the ribs ascend,  because of the action of the muscles attached to them. The diaphragm  being concave below toward the abdomen, the contents of this cavity  fit closely to its under surface. There are found the liver, stomach,  intestines, etc.--a part of great practical importance, as will be  shown presently.    Naturally, in breathing, the organs of the abdomen, especially those  above, are pressed down somewhat with the descent of the diaphragm in  inspiration, and, in turn, push out the abdominal walls. If, however,  the midriff contract so powerfully that the lower ribs are drawn  inward, the abdominal walls follow them. Although the actual extent of  the descent of the diaphragm is small in itself, since the total  surface is large it effects a very considerable enlargement of the  chest in the vertical diameter.    The capacity of the lungs for air is a very variable quantity:    1. The quantity of air taken in with a single inspiration in quiet  breathing (_tidal air_) is about 20-30 cubic inches.    2. The quantity taken in with the deepest possible inspiration  (_complemental air_) is about 100 cubic inches.    3. The quantity that may be expelled by the most forcible expiration  (_supplemental air_) is about 100 cubic inches.    4. The quantity that can under no circumstances be expelled (_residual  air_) is about 100 cubic inches.    5. The quantity that can be expelled after the most forcible  inspiration--_i.e._, the amount of air that can be moved--indicates  the _vital capacity_. This varies very much with the individual, and  depends not a little on the elasticity of the chest walls, and so  diminishes with age. It follows that youth is the best period for the  development of the chest, and the time to learn that special  breath-control so essential to good singing and speaking.    When the ribs have been raised by inspiration and the abdominal organs  pressed down by the diaphragm, the chest, on the cessation of the act,  tends to resume its former shape, owing to elastic recoil quite apart  from all muscular action; in other words, inspiration is active,  expiration largely passive."]]]
