[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#8)"],[1,"h, having finished, she said to him in an authoritative  tone, \"Put an end to your gluttony, and hear the splendid promises with  which you are favoured!\"  She then read as follows: \"Vathek, my  well-beloved, thou hast surpassed my hopes; my nostrils have been regaled  by the savour of thy mummies, thy horns, and still more by the lives  devoted on the pile.  At the full of the moon cause the bands of thy  musicians and thy tymbals to be heard; depart from thy palace surrounded  by all the pageants of majesty; thy most faithful slaves, thy best  beloved wives, thy most magnificent litters, thy richest leaden camels,  and set forward on thy way to Istakhar; there await I thy coming; that is  the region of wonders; there shalt thou receive the diadem of Gian Ben  Gian, the talismans of Soliman, and the treasures of the Pre-Adamite  Sultans; there shalt thou be solaced with all kinds of delight.  But  beware how thou enterest any dwelling on thy route, or thou shalt feel  the effects of my anger.\"    The Caliph, who, notwithstanding his habitual luxury, had never before  dined with so much satisfaction, gave full scope to the joy of these  golden tidings, and betook himself to drinking anew.  Carathis, whose  antipathy to wine was by no means insuperable, failed not to supply a  reason for every bumper, which they ironically quaffed to the health of  Mahomet.  This infernal liquor completed their impious temerity, and  prompted them to utter a profusion of blasphemies; they gave a loose to  their wit at the expense of the ass of Balaam, the dog of the seven  sleepers, and the other animals admitted into the paradise of Mahomet.  In this sprightly humour they descended the eleven thousand stairs,  diverting themselves as they went at the anxious faces they saw on the  square through the oilets of the tower, and at length arrived at the  royal apartments by the subterranean passage.  Bababalouk was parading to  and fro, and issuing his mandates with great pomp to the eunuchs, who  were snuffing the lights and painting the eyes of the Circassians.  No  sooner did he catch sight of the Caliph and his mother than he exclaimed,  \"Hah! you have then, I perceive, escaped from the flames; I was not,  however, altogether out of doubt.\"    \"Of what moment is it to us what you thought, or think?\" cried Carathis;  \"go, speed, tell Morakanabad that we immediately want him; and take care  how you stop by the way to make your insipid reflections.\"    Morakanabad delayed not to obey the summons, and was received by Vathek  and his mother with great solemnity; they told him, with an air of  composure and commiseration, that the fire at the top of the tower was  extinguished; but that it had cost the lives of the brave people who  sought to assist them.    \"Still more misfortunes,\" cried Morakanabad, with a sigh.  \"Ah, Commander  of the Faithful, our holy Prophet is certainly irritated against us! it  behoves you to appease him.\"    \"We will appease him hereafter!\" replied the Caliph, with a smile that  augured nothing of good.  \"You will have leisure sufficient for your  supplications during my absence; for this country is the bane of my  health; I am disgusted with the mountain of the Four Fountains, and am  resolved to go and drink of the stream of Rocnabad; I long to refresh  myself in the delightful valleys which it waters.  Do you, with the  advice of my mother, govern my dominions, and take care to supply  whatever her experiments may demand; for you well know that our tower  abounds in materials for the advancement of science.\"    The tower but ill suited Morakanabad's taste.  Immense treasures had been  lavished upon it; and nothing had he ever seen carried thither but female  negroes, mutes, and abominable drugs.  Nor did he know well what to think  of Carathis, who, like a chameleon, could assume all possible colours;  her cursed eloquence had often driven the poor Mussulman to his last  shifts.  He considered, however, that if she possessed but few good  qualities, her son had still fewer; and that the alternative on the whole  would be in her favour.  Consoled, therefore, with this reflection, he  went in good spirits to soothe the populace, and make the proper  arrangements for his master's journey.    Vathek, to conciliate the Spirits of the subterranean palace, resolved  that his expedition should be uncommonly splendid.  With this view he  confiscated on all sides the property of his subjects, whilst his worthy  mother stripped the seraglios she visited of the gems they contained.  She collected all the sempstresses and embroiderers of Samarah and other  cities to the distance of sixty leagues, to prepare pavilions,  palanquins, sofas, canopies, and litters for the train of the monarch.  There was not left in Masulipatam a single piece of chintz, and so much  muslin had been bought up to dress out Bababalouk and the other black  eunuchs, that there remained not an ell in the whole Irak of Babylon.    During these preparations Carathis, who never lost sight of her great  object, which was to obtain favour with the Powers of Darkness, made  select parties of the fairest and most delicate ladies of the city; but  in the midst of their gaiety she contrived to introduce serpents amongst  them, and to break pots of scorpions under the table; they all bit to a  wonder; and Carathis would have left them to bite, were it not that, to  fill up the time, she now and then amused herself in curing their wounds  with an excellent anodyne of her own invention, for this good princess  abhorred being indolent.    Vathek, who was not altogether so active as his mother, devoted his time  to the sole gratification of his senses, in the palaces which were  severally dedicated to them; he disgusted himself no more with the Divan  or the Mosque.  One half of Samarah followed his example, whilst the  other lamented the progress of corruption.    In the midst of these transactions the embassy returned which had been  sent in pious times to Mecca.  It consisted of the most reverend  Moullahs, who had fulfilled their commission and brought back one of  those precious besoms which are used to sweep the sacred Caaba: a present  truly worthy of the greatest potentate on earth!    The Caliph happened at this instant to be engaged in an apartment by no  means adapted to the reception of embassies, though adorned with a  certain magnificence, not only to render it agreeable, but also because  he resorted to it frequently, and stayed a considerable time together.  Whilst occupied in this retreat he heard the voice of Bababalouk calling  out from between the door and the tapestry that hung before it: \"Here are  the excellent Mahomet Ebn Edris al Shafei, and the seraphic Al  Mouhadethin, who have brought the besom from Mecca, and with tears of joy  intreat they may present it to your majesty in person.\"    \"Let them bring the besom hither; it may be of use,\" said Vathek, who was  still employed, not having quite racked off his wine.    \"How!\" said Bababalouk, half aloud and amazed.    \"Obey,\" replied the Caliph, \"for it is my sovereign will; go instantly,  vanish; for here will I receive the good folk, who have thus filled thee  with joy.\"    The eunuch departed muttering, and bade the venerable train attend him.  A sacred rapture was diffused amongst these reverend old men.  Though  fatigued with the length of their expedition, they followed Bababalouk  with an alertness almost miraculous, and felt themselves highly  flattered, as they swept along the stately porticoes, that the Caliph  would not receive them like ambassadors in ordinary in his hall of  audience.  Soon reaching the interior of the harem (where, through blinds  of Persian, they perceived large soft eyes, dark and blue, that went and  came like lightning), penetrated with respect and wonder, and full of  their celestial mission, they advanced in procession towards the small  corridors that appeared to terminate in nothing, but nevertheless led to  the cell where the Caliph expected their coming.    \"What! is the Commander of the Faithful sick?\" said Ebn Edris al Shafei  in a low voice to his companion.    \"I rather think he is in his oratory,\" answered Al Mouhadethin.    Vathek, who heard the dialogue, cried out: \"What imports it you how I am  employed? approach without delay.\"    They advanced, and Bababalouk almost sunk with confusion, whilst the  Caliph, without showing himself, put forth his hand from behind the  tapestry that hung before the door, and demanded of them the besom.  Having prostrated themselves as well as the corridor would permit, and  even in a tolerable semicircle, the venerable Al Shafei, drawing forth  the besom from the embroidered and perfumed scarves in which it had been  enveloped, and secured from the profane gaze of vulgar eyes, arose from  his associates, and advanced, with an air of the most awful solemnity,  towards the supposed oratory; but with what astonishment! with what  horror was he seized!  Vathek, bursting out into a villainous laugh,  snatched the besom from his trembling hand, and, fixing upon some cobwebs  that hung suspended from the ceiling, gravely brushed away till not a  single one remained.  The old men, overpowered with amazement, were  unable to lift their beards from the ground; for, as Vathek had  carelessly left the tapestry between them half drawn, they were witnesses  to the whole transaction; their tears gushed forth on the marble; Al  Mouhadethin swooned through mortification and fatigue; whilst the Caliph,  throwing himself backward on his seat, shouted and clapped his hands  without mercy.  At last, addressing himself to Bababalouk: \"My dear  black,\" said he, \"go, regale these pious poor souls with my good wine  from Shiraz; and, as they can boast of having seen more of my palace than  any one besides, let them also visit my office courts, and lead them out  by the back steps that go to my stables.\"  Having said this, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#8)"],[1,"there was no one to interfere, and he enjoyed himself to that degree  that he quite forgot to wonder why he hadn't been called. He thought of  a piece of poetry that Helen had made for him, about the bath; and when  he had done playing he lay on his back in water that was very hot  indeed, trying to remember the poetry. The water was very nearly cold by  the time he had remembered the poetry. It was called Dreams of a Giant  Life, and this was it.      DREAMS OF A GIANT LIFE              What was I once--in ages long ago?            I look back, and I see myself. We grow            So changed through changing years, I hardly see            How that which I look back on could be me?[1]              Glorious and splendid, giant-like I stood            On a white cliff, topped by a darkling wood.            Below me, placid, bright and sparkling, lay            The equal waters of a lovely bay.            White cliffs surrounded it--and calm and fair            It lay asleep, in warm and silent air.              I stood alone--naked and strong, upright            My limbs gleamed in the clear pure golden light.            I saw below me all the water lie            Expecting something, and that thing was I.[2]              I leaned, I plunged, the waves splashed over me.            I lay, a giant in a little sea.              White cliffs all round, wood-crowned, and as I lay            I saw the glories of the dying day;            No wind disturbed my sea; the sunlight was            As though it came through windows of gold glass.            The white cliffs rose above me, and around            The clear sea lay, pure, perfect and profound;            And I was master of the cliffs, the sea,            And the gold light that brightened over me.              Far miles away my giant feet showed plain,            Rising, like rocks out of the quiet main.            On them a lighthouse could be built, to show            Wayfaring ships the way they must not go.              I was the master of that cliff-girt sea.            I splashed my hands, the waves went over me,            And in the dimples of my body lay            Little rock-pools, where small sea-beasts might play.              I found a boat, its deck was perforate;            I launched it, and it dared the storms of fate.            Its woollen sail stood out against the sky,            Supported by a mast of ivory.              Another boat rode proudly to my hand,            Upon its deck a thousand spears did stand;            I launched it, and it sped full fierce and fast            Against the boat that had the ivory mast            And woollen sail and perforated deck.            The two went down in one stupendous wreck!              Beneath the waves I chased with joyous hand            Upon the bed of an imagined sand            The slippery brown sea mouse, that still escaped,            Where the deep cave beneath my knee was shaped.            Caught it at last and caged it into rest            Upon the shallows of my submerged breast.              Then, as I lay, wrapped as in some kind arm            By the sweet world of waters soft and warm,            A great voice cried, from some far unseen shore,            And I was not a giant any more.              'Come out, come out,' cried out the voice of power,            'You've been in for a quarter of an hour.            The water's cold--come, Master Pip--your head            'S all wet, and it is time you were in bed.'              I rose all dripping from the magic sea            And left the ships that had been slaves to me--            The soap-dish, with its perforated deck,            The nail-brush, that had rushed to loss and wreck,            The flannel sail, the tooth-brush that was mast,            The sleek soap-mouse--I left them all at last.              I went out of that magic sea and cried            Because the time came when I must be dried            And leave the splendour of a giant's joy            And go to bed--a little well-washed boy.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Never mind grammar.    [2] This is correct grammar, but never mind.      When he had quite remembered the poetry he had another shower-bath, and  then when he had enjoyed the hot rough towels out of the hot cupboard he  went back to his room to dress. He now felt how deeply he wanted his  breakfast, so he dressed himself with all possible speed, even  forgetting to fasten his bootlaces properly. He was in such a hurry that  he dropped his collar-stud, and it was as he stooped to pick it up that  he remembered his dream. Do you know that was really the first time he  had thought of it. The dream--that indeed would be something to think  about.    Breakfast was the really important thing. He went down very hungry  indeed. 'I shall ask for my breakfast directly I get down,' he said. 'I  shall ask the first person I meet.' And he met no one.    There was no one on the stairs, or in the hall, or in the dining-room,  or in the drawing-room. The library and billiard-room were empty of  living people, and the door of the nursery was locked. So then Philip  made his way into the regions beyond the baize door, where the servants'  quarters were. And there was no one in the kitchen, or in the servants'  hall, or in the butler's pantry, or in the scullery, or the washhouse,  or the larder. In all that big house, and it was much bigger than it  looked from the front because of the long wings that ran out on each  side of its back--in all that big house there was no one but Philip. He  felt certain of this before he ran upstairs and looked in all the  bedrooms and in the little picture gallery and the music-room, and then  in the servants' bedrooms and the very attics. There were interesting  things in those attics, but Philip only remembered that afterwards. Now  he tore down the stairs three at a time. All the room doors were open as  he had left them, and somehow those open doors frightened him more than  anything else. He ran along the corridors, down more stairs, past more  open doors and out through the back kitchen, along the moss-grown walk  by the brick wall and so round by the three yew trees and the mounting  block to the stable-yard. And there was no one there. Neither coachman  nor groom nor stable-boys. And there was no one in the stables, or the  coach-house, or the harness-room, or the loft.    Philip felt that he could not go back into the house. Something terrible  must have happened. Was it possible that any one could want the Grange  servants enough to kidnap them? Philip thought of the nurse and felt  that, at least as far as she was concerned, it was _not_ possible. Or  perhaps it was magic! A sort of Sleeping-Beauty happening! Only every  one had vanished instead of just being put to sleep for a hundred years.    He was alone in the middle of the stable-yard when the thought came to  him.    'Perhaps they're only made invisible. Perhaps they're all here and  watching me and making fun of me.'    He stood still to think this. It was not a pleasant thought.    Suddenly he straightened his little back, and threw back his head.    'They shan't see I'm frightened anyway,' he told himself. And then he  remembered the larder.    'I haven't had any breakfast,' he explained aloud, so as to be plainly  heard by any invisible people who might be about. 'I ought to have my  breakfast. If nobody gives it to me I shall take my breakfast.'    He waited for an answer. But none came. It was very quiet in the  stable-yard. Only the rattle of a halter ring against a manger, the  sound of a hoof on stable stones, the cooing of pigeons and the rustle  of straw in the loose-box broke the silence.    'Very well,' said Philip. 'I don't know what _you_ think I ought to have  for breakfast, so I shall take what _I_ think.'    He drew a long breath, trying to draw courage in with it, threw back his  shoulders more soldierly than ever, and marched in through the back door  and straight to the larder. Then he took what he thought he ought to  have for breakfast. This is what he thought:              1 cherry pie,            2 custards in cups,            1 cold sausage,            2 pieces of cold toast,            1 piece of cheese,            2 lemon cheese-cakes,            1 small jam tart (there was only one left),            Butter, 1 pat.    'What jolly things the servants have to eat,' he said. 'I never knew. I  thought that nothing but mutton and rice grew here.'    He put all the food on a silver tray and carried it out on to the  terrace, which lies between the two wings at the back of the house. Then  he went back for milk, but there was none to be seen so he got a white  jug full of water. The spoons he couldn't find, but he found a  carving-fork and a fish-slice. Did you ever try to eat cherry pie with a  fish-slice?    'Whatever's happened,' said Philip to himself, through the cherry pie,  'and whatever happens it's as well to have had your breakfast.' And he  bit a generous inch off the cold sausage which he had speared with the  carving-fork.    And now, sitting out in the good sunshine, and growing less and less  hungry as he plied fish-slice and carving-fork, his mind went back to  his dream, which began to seem more and more real. Suppose it really  _had_ happened? It might have; magic things did happen, it seemed. Look  how all the people had vanished out of the house--out of the world too,  perhaps.    'Suppose every one's vanished,' said Philip. 'Suppose I'm the only  person left in the world who hasn't vanished. Then everything in the  world would belong to me. Then I could have everything that's in all the  toy shops.' And his mind for a moment dwelt fondly on this beautiful  idea.    Then he went on. 'But suppose I vanished too? Perhaps if I were to  vanish I could see the other people who have. I wonder how it's done.'    He held his breath and tried hard to vanish. Have you ever tried this? "]]]
