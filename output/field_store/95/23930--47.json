To his surprise, the other at once agreed to it.    \"Why, Bacri,\" he said, with a smile, as with his right hand he tenderly  caressed his injured nose, \"you must have been more than usually  successful in swindling of late.\"    \"God has recently granted me more than deserved prosperity,\" returned  the other.    Without further palaver the bargain was struck.  Hassan accompanied the  Jew to his residence in one of the quaint Moorish houses of the old  town.  Angela was handed over to Bacri's wife, a pleasant-visaged woman  of forty, and Hassan returned home with his pockets well lined, his nose  much swelled, and his temper greatly improved.    Bethinking him of the Dey's commands, he set out with Paulina and her  infant for the residence of the British consul, which lay a short  distance outside the northern wall of the town, not far from the bluff  height on which, at the present day, towers the picturesque pile of  Notre-Dame d'Afrique.        CHAPTER SIX.    SENDS A GLEAM OF HOPE INTO A GLOOMY REGION.    The short twilight of southern latitudes was giving place to the shades  of night, when Bacri the Jew issued from the low door of his house, and  threaded the narrow labyrinth of streets which compose the old town of  Algiers.    The greater part of the old, or, as it is styled, the Moorish town,  remains almost exactly the same at the present time that it was at the  time of which our tale treats.  It occupied the face of a steep hill,  and was built in the form of a triangle, the apex being a fort, or  \"casba,\" near the summit of the hill.  The base was a street of oriental  houses upwards of half a mile in extent, beyond which the sea-wall, well  lined with batteries, rose directly from the beach, and was washed by  the spray in every breeze.  All the houses facing the sea have now been  taken down, and their places are occupied by wide handsome streets of  French buildings; the beach and the site of the old wall being occupied  by splendid quays, wharves, and terraces.    The houses of the Moorish town were square white-washed blocks, built so  close to each other that most of the streets were mere lanes, not more  than from six to ten feet wide.  No windows worthy of the name garnished  the dead white walls of these houses, whose light sprang in reality from  within, each house being in the form of a square of building surrounding  a central court, which at the top was open to the weather.  The real  windows of the houses looked into the courts, which, however, were by no  means dismal.  They had fountains in the midst of them, which sent up a  perpetual--and, in such a climate, grateful--sound of trickling water;  while in their corners and elsewhere boxes of earth enabled  banana-trees, and palms, and various creepers, to convert the little  spots into delightful, though miniature, gardens.  Such windows as  opened outwards were mere loop-holes, not much more than a foot square--  many of them less,--the larger of them being always strongly grated.  Most of these houses projected beyond their basement storeys, thus  rendering the open space above narrower than the streets below, and in  many cases the walls absolutely met, and converted the streets into  tunnels.  Strange wooden props, seemingly insufficient for their duty,  upheld these projecting upper storeys, and gave a peculiarly un-European  character to the streets,--a character which became still more  perplexing to the stranger when he observed here and there, in places  where architecture had scarcely space or light to be seen, fountains of  the most elegant design and workmanship; doorways of white marble, most  elaborately and beautifully carved; and entrance-halls that resembled  courts of the Alhambra in miniature.    When one first sees such things they induce surprise, but the surprise  evaporates when we reflect that these pirates had at their command the  services of thousands of slaves, many of whom represented the artistic  talent of the civilised world.    Passing rapidly along these narrow streets, and bending his tall form  when he came to low archways, Bacri at length emerged on the chief \"high  street\" of the town, which, entering at the north, or Bab-el-Oued gate,  completely traversed the city under that name as far as the Dey's  palace, where it changed its name to Bab-Azoun, and terminated at the  south gate of the same name.    In this street was the Bagnio, already mentioned as being the prison of  the government slaves.    Here Bacri paused, drew a glittering coin from his pocket, and knocked  at a strong oaken door.  A janissary opened, and roughly demanded his  business, but changed his tone at once and gave the Jew admission, on  receiving the coin.    Passing though a lobby, whose marble pillars were sadly broken and  disfigured, the Jew entered a courtyard, open to the sky, around which  were a number of recesses or cells.  In these the unhappy slaves sat  huddled together.  They were not cold, for it was summer; but their  misery and want of space probably induced them to cling closely to each  other.    The place had once been a bathing establishment, and an old fountain  still gurgled in the centre of the court; but its drains had been choked  long ago, and the waters had overflowed, to find exit as they best  might, rendering the floor a damp and uncomfortable residence for  scorpions, centipedes, and other repulsive insects.    The slaves received only two small rolls of black bread as their rations  at the close of each day, and they were too eagerly engaged in devouring  these to pay much regard to their visitor.    Looking carefully round, the Jew at length discovered the objects of his  search,--Francisco, Lucien, and Mariano Rimini.  The two first were  seated side by side, eating their meagre meal.  Mariano lay near them,  heavily laden with irons, and also endeavouring to eat.    \"Friends,\" said Bacri, approaching them.    \"Villain!\" cried Mariano, starting up into a reclining attitude, despite  the agony that the act occasioned, and fixing his eyes on the Jew.    \"You do me injustice, young man,\" said Bacri, seating himself on the  basement of a pillar.    \"It may be that he does you injustice,\" said Lucien sternly,  \"nevertheless we have all of us good reason to believe that you are a  friend of the pirate Hassan, and no friend of ours.\"    \"Whether friend or foe, say thy say, man, and be gone,\" cried the bluff  Francisco, whose spirit suffered even more than his body from the  indignities to which he had been subjected that day.    \"Listen, then,\" said Bacri impressively.  \"You know my name and nation,  but you do not know that I am the chief of the Jews in this city of  devils.  I and my people are regarded by these followers of Mohammed as  worse than the dogs in their streets, yet, while they treat us with the  utmost indignity, they know that we are good traders, and as such bring  riches within their walls.  I have power--the power of wealth--to help  you at a pinch; indeed I _have_ helped you, for it was only by means of  a promise of gold that I induced Sidi Hassan to spare your lives when  his men were bent on taking them.  But that is not what I came to tell  you to-night.  I came to say that the poor captive girls with whom you  voyaged to this place are for the present out of danger.\"    \"Say you so?\" exclaimed Mariano eagerly.  \"How can that be?  Did I not  see Angela led to the slave-market this very afternoon?\"    \"You did, and I purchased her for the purpose of protecting her.  She is  now in my house.  Her sister and the infant have been sent as a  temporary gift or loan to the British consul, under whose care she is  safe _for the present_.  But be not too sanguine,\" added Bacri, seeing  that Mariano's countenance brightened; \"the whim of the Dey, or a change  of government, which latter is common enough here, may totally alter the  state of affairs.  If the Dey willed it, I could not hold anything that  belongs to me for an hour.  They call us dogs, and treat us as such.\"    \"They are themselves dogs!\" cried Mariano indignantly.    \"Christians have called us by the same name,\" returned the Jew calmly,  \"thereby proving the falsity of their own faith.\"    \"Say not so!\" cried Lucien with animation.  \"Many, calling themselves  Christians, have undoubtedly treated your race ill, but those who really  love the Lord Jesus cannot help respecting the people from whom Himself  sprang.  I side not with those who disgrace themselves by vilifying the  Jews.\"    Lucien extended his hand as he spoke, and Bacri grasped it kindly.    \"Bah! you are fools; all of you arrant idiots!\" cried a wild-looking  ragged man in the neighbouring cell, starting up and glaring at them as  he clenched his fists.  \"What avails Christianity, or Judaism, or  anything else here?  'Tis a world of fiends!--ha, ha! murderers,  tormentors, hypocrites,--ha! ha!\"    Here the man gave vent to a burst of wild ferocious laughter, so loud  that even the careless and callous warder was disturbed, and rattled his  keys as if about to enter.  The sound appeared to send a chill to the  heart of the captive; an expression of terror overspread his thin  haggard features, and he shrunk together as he retired quickly to the  remotest corner of his cell.    \"A maniac, I fear,\" said Francisco in a low tone, observing that the Jew  regarded him with a look of pity.    \"No, not quite mad,\" replied Bacri in the same low tone, \"but sometimes  very near it, I think.  Poor man, I know him well.  He has been fifteen  years a prisoner in Algiers.  When first brought here he was as fine a  specimen of a Genoese youth as I ever saw.  His name is Lorenzo Benoni.  He was captured with his wife and two children, all of whom died before  the first year"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#8)"],[1,"e, but the travellers had gone on, and  the only one who remained was a poor man who lay in an out-house very  sick.    \"Who is he?\" asked Pedro, as he assisted Manuela to alight.    \"I know not, senhor,\" replied the host.  \"He is a stranger, who tells me  he has been robbed.  I can well believe it, for he has been roughly  handled, and there are some well-known bandits in the neighbourhood.  His injuries would not have been so serious, however, if he had not  caught a fever from exposure.\"    \"Indeed,\" returned the guide, who, however, seemed more interested in  unsaddling his mules than in listening to the account of the unfortunate  man, \"was it near this that he fell in with the bandits?\"    \"No, senhor, it was far to the west.  The travellers who brought him on  said they found him almost insensible on the banks of a stream into  which he appeared to have fallen or been thrown.\"    Pedro glanced at Lawrence.    \"Hear you that, senhor?\"    \"My Spanish only suffices to inform me that some one has been robbed and  injured.\"    Explaining fully what their host had said, Pedro advised Lawrence to  visit the stranger in his medical character.    \"My friend is a doctor,\" he said, turning to the host, \"take him to the  sick man; for myself, I will put up the mules and then assist the old  mother, for mountain air sharpens appetite.\"    In a rude, tumble-down hut close to the main building Lawrence found his  patient.  He lay stretched in a corner on a heap of straw in a state of  great exhaustion--apparently dying--and with several bandages about his  cut and bruised head and face.    The first glance told Lawrence that it was Antonio, the robber whom he  had tried to rescue, but he carefully concealed his knowledge, and,  bending over the man, addressed him as if he were a stranger.  The start  and look of surprise mingled with alarm on the robber's face told that  he had recognised Lawrence, but he also laid restraint on himself, and  drew one of the bandages lower down on his eyes.    Feeling his pulse, Lawrence asked him about his food.    He got little, he said, and that little was not good; the people of the  farm seemed to grudge it.    \"My poor man,\" said Lawrence in his bad Spanish, \"they are starving you  to death.  But I'll see to that.\"    He rose and went out quickly.  Returning with a basin of soup, he  presented it to the invalid, who ate it with relish.  Then the man began  to relate how he had been attacked a few days before by a party of  robbers in one of the mountain passes, who had cut the throats of all  his party in cold blood, and had almost killed himself, when he was  rescued by the opportune arrival of some travellers.    Lawrence was much disgusted at first by the man's falsehood.  Observing  the poor fellow's extreme weakness, however, and his evident anxiety  lest he should be recognised, the feeling changed to pity.  Laying his  hand gently on the man's shoulder, he said, with a look of solemnity  which perchance made, up to some extent for the baldness of the  phraseology--    \"Antonio, tell not lies; you are dying!\"    The startled man looked at his visitor earnestly.  \"Am I dying?\" he  asked, in a low tone.    \"You are, perhaps; I know not.  I will save you if possible.\"    These words were accompanied by a kind look and a comforting pat on the  shoulder, which, it may be, did more for the sick man than the best of  physic.  At all events the result was a sudden grasp of the hand and a  look of gratitude which spoke volumes.  The robber was about to give  vent to his feelings in speech when the door opened, and the burly host,  putting his head in, announced that supper was ready.    Giving his patient another reassuring pat, the young doctor left him and  returned to the banqueting-hall of the mountain farm, where he found  that Manuela, Pedro, and Quashy were more or less earnestly engaged with  the contents of the iron pot.        CHAPTER FIVE.    LAWRENCE AND QUASHY BECOME \"FLOSUFFICAL,\" AND THEY CAMP OUT BESIDE THE  \"GIANT'S CASTLE.\"    While the party were at supper the first gusts of a storm, which had for  some time been brewing, shook the little hut, and before they had all  fallen into the profound slumber which usually followed their day's  journey, a heavy gale was howling among the mountain gorges with a noise  like the roaring of a thousand lions.  For two days the gale raged so  furiously that travelling--especially in the higher regions of the  Andes--became impossible.  The Indian girl, Pedro, and the negro, bore  their detention with that stoicism which is not an infrequent  characteristic of mountaineers, guides, and savages.  As for our hero,  he devoted himself and all his skill to his patient--to which duty he  was the more reconciled that it afforded him a good opportunity at once  for improving his Spanish and pointing out to the bandit the error of  his ways.    To do the man justice, he seemed to be fully sensible of the young  doctor's kindness, and thanked him, with tears in his eyes, not only for  his previous intention to save him from the tremendous fall over the  cliff, but for his subsequent efforts to alleviate the evil consequences  thereof.    It mattered nothing to the great warm-hearted, loose-jointed Englishman  that when he mentioned these hopeful signs in his patient to Pedro, that  worthy shook his head and smiled sarcastically, or that Quashy received  the same information with a closing of the eyes and an expansion of the  jaws which revealed the red recesses of his throat to their darkest  deeps!  Lawrence, being a man of strong opinions, was not to be shaken  out of them either by sarcasm or good-humoured contempt.    Turning to the Indian girl for sympathy, he related the matter to her at  a time when the other inhabitants of the hut had gone out and left them  alone.    \"You see,--Manuela,\" he said, with the frown of meditation on his brow,  and his eyes fixed on the ceiling, \"I have no belief in the very common  idea that there is a soft spot in the heart of every man, however bad;  but I do believe that the heart of the very worst of men may be made  soft by the Spirit of God, and that He employs us, who call ourselves  Christians, as His agents in bringing about the result.  It is quite  possible that I may have been thrown in the way of this robber for the  very purpose of touching his heart through kindness--God's own  motive-power--and that the Spirit will soften his heart to receive the  touch.\"    He paused, and, withdrawing his gaze from the ceiling, observed that the  girl's eyes were fixed on his face with an expression of perplexity and  earnestness.    It then suddenly occurred to him that, having spoken in English, she  could not have understood him.    \"But you _do_ look as if you had some idea of what I have been saying,  Manuela.  Have you?\"    \"Si, senhor, some,\" was the reply, as she dropped her eyes with an  embarrassed look and blushed so as to make her pretty brown face look  alarmingly red.    Endeavouring to convey the same ideas through the medium of Spanish,  Lawrence made such a bungle of it that Manuela, instead of expressing  sympathy, began to struggle so obviously with her feelings that the poor  Englishman gave up the attempt, and good-naturedly joined his companion  in a little burst of laughter.  They were in the midst of this when the  door opened and Quashy entered.    \"You 'pears to be jolly,\" observed the genial negro, with every wrinkle  of his black visage ready to join in sympathetically, \"was de jok a  desprit good un?\"    \"Not very desperate, Quashy,\" said Lawrence, \"it was only my bad Spanish  which made Manuela laugh.  If you had been here to interpret we might  have got on better with our philosophical discourse.\"    \"O massa!\" returned the black--solemn remonstrance, both in manner and  tone, putting to sudden flight the beaming look of sympathy--\"don't  speak of me 'terpretin' Spinich.  Nebber could take kindly to dat stuff.  Ob course I kin talk wid de peons an' de gauchos, whose conv'sation am  mostly 'bout grub, an' hosses, an' cattle, an' dollars, an' murder, but  when I tries to go in for flosuffy, an' sitch like, I breaks down  altogidder.\"    At this point the Indian girl's tendency to laugh increased, but whether  because of fresh views of the absurdity of what had passed, or because  of some faint perception of the negro's meaning, Lawrence had no power  to decide.    \"I should have thought, Quashy,\" he said, with a return of his wonted  gravity, \"that a man of a thoughtful and contemplative turn of mind like  you would have acquired the power of expressing almost any idea in  Spanish by this time.\"    \"T'ank you for de compl'ment, massa,\" replied Quashy, \"but I not so  clebber as you t'ink.  Der am some tings in flosuffy dat beats me.  When  I tries to putt 'em afore oder peepil in Spinich, I somehow gits de  brain-pan into sitch a conglomeration ob fumbustication dat I not able  to see quite clar what I mean myself--dough, ob course, I knows dat I'm  right.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Yis; but de great consolation I has is dat de peepil I'm talkin' to  don't onderstand me a mossel better nor myself; an', ob course, as  noting in de wurl could show dem dey was wrong, it don't much matter.\"    \"That is good philosophy, at all events.  Isn't it, Manuela?\" asked  Lawrence in Spanish.    \"Si, senhor,\" replied the girl, with sparkling eyes and a dazzling  display of little teeth which seemed to indicate that she fully  appreciated what was said.    \"Strange,\" thought Lawrence--\"so grave and pensive, yet at times so  sprightly; so intelligent, yet, of course, so ignorant; so very brown,  and yet so pretty.  What a pity she is not white!\"    He only said, however, with a sigh, \"Is the gale abating, Quashy?\"    To which the negro replied, with a responsive sigh, \"Yis, massa,--it  am.\"    After two days' delay our travellers were enabled to proceed.
