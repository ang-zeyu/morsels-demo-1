A recent article in a stray number of a professional journal picked up  in the office of a medical missionary, devoted column after column to  the uselessness of all known methods of disinfection. Sulphur,  formaldehyde, carbolic acid, permanganate of potash, chloride of lime,  bichloride of mercury--the author knew not which of these \"fetiches\" to  be most sarcastic about. It may be that the net result of our copious  fumigation was but the bleaching of the coloured garments hung up, but  at least it did no harm. One sometimes wishes that these scientists who  sit up so high in the seat of the scornful would condescend to a little  plain instruction.    The anti-diphtheritic serum is now kept in readiness at all our  missions in Alaska, and the disease seems to have ceased its  depredations; but it has taken terrible toll of the native people.    [Sidenote: THE MISSIONARY NURSE]    We wished to stay with the nurse until the sickness should be done, but  she would not hear of it, and insisted upon the resumption of our  journey. It did not seem right to go off and leave this lonely woman,  sixty-five miles from the nearest white person, to cope with an outbreak  of disease that might not yet have spent itself, although there had been  no new case for a week. \"You've done your work here, now leave me to do  mine. You'll not get to Point Hope this winter if you stay much longer.\"    \"Aren't you afraid to stay all by yourself?\" I asked, somewhat  fatuously.    \"Afraid? Afraid of what? You surely don't mean afraid of the natives?\"    I did not know what I meant; it seemed not unnatural that a woman with  such prospect before her should be a little timid, but she was resolute  that we go, and we went.    Not until the next summer did I learn the upshot--both patients  recovered and there was no other case. Six years later, when these words  are written, I have just baptized a son of the boy who lay so ill, who  would have perished, I think, had we not reached the Chandalar village  just in time.          CHAPTER II    CHANDALAR VILLAGE TO BETTLES, COLDFOOT, AND THE KOYUKUK      AT five o'clock in the morning of the 27th of December, hours before any  kind of daylight, while the faint \"pit-pat\" of all-night dancing still  sounded from the chief's cabin, we dropped down the steep bank to the  river surface and resumed our journey. Ahead was a man with a candle in  a tin can, peering for the faint indications of the trail on the ice;  the other two were at the handle-bars of the toboggans. It is strange  that in this day of invention and improvement in artificial  illumination, a candle in a tin can is still the most dependable light  for the trail. A coal-oil lamp requires a glass which is easily broken,  and the ordinary coal-oil that comes to Alaska freezes at about 40 deg.  below. In very cold weather a coal-oil lantern full of oil will go out  completely from the freezing of its supply. All the various acetylene  lamps are useless because water is required to generate the gas, and  water may not be had without stopping and building a fire and melting  ice or snow. The electric flash-lamp, useful enough round camp, goes out  of operation altogether on the trail, because the \"dry\" cell that  supplies its current is not a dry cell at all, but a moist cell, and  when its moisture freezes is dead until it thaws out again. No extremity  of cold will stop a candle from burning, and if it be properly sheltered  by the tin can it will stand a great deal of wind. The \"folding pocket  lantern,\" which is nothing but a convenient tin can with mica sides, is  the best equipment for travel, but an empty butter can or lard can is  sometimes easier to come by.    The Chandalar is wide-spread in these parts, with several channels, and  the trail was hard to follow. One track we pursued led us up a bank and  along a portage and presently stopped at a marten trap; and we had to  cut across to the river and cast about hither and thither on its broad  surface to find the mail trail.    [Sidenote: THE CHANDALAR GAP]    All the rivers that are confluent with the Yukon in the Flats enter that  dreary region through gaps in the mountains that bound the broad plain.  These gaps are noted for wind, and the Chandalar Gap, which had loomed  before us since daybreak, is deservedly in especial bad repute. The most  hateful thing in the Arctic regions is the wind. Cold one may protect  one's self against, but there is no adequate protection against wind.  The parkee without opening front or back, that pulls on over the head,  is primarily a windbreak, and when a scarf is wrapped around mouth and  nose, and the fur-edged hood of the parkee is pulled forward over cap  and scarf, the traveller who must face the wind has done all he can to  protect himself from it.    [Illustration: SUNRISE ON THE CHANDALAR-KOYUKUK PORTAGE.]    Unfortunately, in the confusion of striking the tent and packing in the  dark, my scarf had been rolled up in the bedding, and, since the wind  was not bad until we approached the Gap in the evening, I had not  troubled about it. Now, as we drew nearer and nearer, the wind rose  constantly. The thermometer was at 38 deg. below zero, and wind at that  temperature cuts like a knife. But to get my scarf meant stopping the  whole procession and unlashing and unloading the sled, and the man who  unlashed in that wind would almost certainly freeze his fingers. So I  gave up the thought of it, turned my back to the wind while I tied my  pocket handkerchief round mouth and nose, drew the strings of my parkee  hood close, and then faced it again to worry through as best I could.  The ice is always swept clear of snow in the Gap. The river narrows  within its jaws, the ragged rocks rise up to the bluffs on either hand,  and the blue-streaked ice stretches between. We all suffered a good  deal. Against that cruel wind it was impossible to keep warm. The hands,  though enclosed in woollen gloves, and they in blanket-lined moose-hide  mitts, grew numb; the toes, within their protection of caribou sock with  the hair on, strips of blanket wrapping, and mukluks stuffed with hay,  tingled with warning of frost-bite; the whole body was chilled. We all  froze our faces, I think, for the part of the face around and between  the eyes cannot be covered. I froze my cheeks, my nose, and my Adam's  apple, the last a most inconvenient thing to freeze.    [Illustration: COLDFOOT ON THE KOYUKUK.]    [Sidenote: A COLD LODGING]    The cabin was just the other side of the Gap, and it was well that it  was no farther, for we were weary with our thirty-mile run and  dangerously cold with the exposure of the last hour. It was rather a  large cabin as trail cabins go, with a rickety sheet-iron stove in the  middle, burned full of holes, and it was hours before the fire began to  make any impression on the obstinate, sullen cold of that hut. When we  went to bed the frost still stood thick and heavy on the walls all over  the room. A log building, properly constructed, is a warm building, but  slowness in parting with heat means slowness in receiving heat, and a  log cabin that has been unoccupied for a long time in very cold weather  is hard to heat in one evening.    When we started next morning the thermometer stood at 45 deg. below zero,  but we were out of the wind region and did not mind the cold. It is  curious that a few miles on either side of that Gap the air will be  still, while in the Gap itself a gale is blowing. Seven times I have  passed through that Gap and only once without wind. The great Flats were  now behind us, we had passed into the mountains, and for the remainder  of our long journey we should scarce ever be out of sight of mountains  again. Up the river, with its constant trouble of overflow, going around  the open water whenever we could, plunging through it in our mukluks  when it could not be avoided--with the care of the dogs' feet that the  cold weather rendered more than ever necessary when they got wet, and  the added nuisance of throwing the toboggans on their sides and beating  the ice from them with the flat of the axe wherever water had been  passed through--for two days we followed its windings, the thermometer  between -45 deg. and -50 deg., the mountains rising higher and the scenery  growing more picturesque as we advanced. At the end of the second day  from the Gap we were at the mouth of the West Fork of the Chandalar, and  after passing up it for fifteen or sixteen miles we left that  watercourse to cross the mountains to the South Fork of the Koyukuk  River.    Then began hard labour again. A toboggan is not a good vehicle for  crossing summits. Its bottom is perfectly flat and smooth, polished like  glass by the friction of the snow. If the trail be at all \"sidling\" (and  mountain trails are almost always \"sidling\"), the toboggan swings off on  the side of the inclination and must be kept on the trail by main force.  The runners of a sled will grip the surface, if there be any  inequalities at all, but a toboggan swings now this way and now that,  like a great pendulum, dragging the near dogs with it. Again and again  we had to hitch both teams to one toboggan to get up a sidling pitch  while all hands kept the vehicle on the trail, and our progress was  painful and slow. In soft snow on a level surface like the river bed or  through the Flat country, generally, the toboggan is much the more  convenient vehicle, for it rides over the snow instead of ploughing  through it, but on hard snow anywhere or on grades the toboggan is a  nuisance. Thus wallowing through the deep snow at the side of the  toboggans to hold them in place we sweated and slaved our way mile after  mile up the gradual ascent until we reached the spot,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22976"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#8)"],[1,"stole eggs and sold 'em durin' slavery. Some of de white  men bought 'em. They were Irishmen and they would not tell on us. Their  names were Mulligan, Flanagan and Dugan. They wore good clothes and were  funny mens. They called guns flutes.    Boss tole us Abraham Lincoln wus dead and we were still slaves. Our  boss man bought black cloth and made us wear it for mourning for Abraham  Lincoln and tole us that there would not be freedom. We stayed there  another year after freedom. A lot o' de niggers knowed nothin' 'cept  what missus and marster tole us. What dey said wus just de same as de  Lawd had spoken to us.    Just after de surrender a nigger woman who wus bad, wus choppin' cotton  at out plantation in Georgie. John Woodfox wus de main overseer and his  son-in-law wus a overseer. Dey had a colored man who dey called a nigger  driver. De nigger driver tole de overseer de woman wus bad. De overseer  came to her, snatched de hoe from her and hit her. The blow killed her.  He was reported to de Freedman's Bureau. Dey came, whupped de overseer  and put him in jail. Dey decided not to kill him, but made him furnish  de children of de dead woman so much to live on. Dere wus a hundred or  more niggers in de field when this murder happened.    We finally found out we were free and left. Dey let me stay with Miss  Julia Brown. I was hired to her. She lived in Dooley County, Georgia. I  next worked with Mrs. Dunbar after staying with Mrs. Brown four years.  Her name wus Mrs. Winnie Dunbar and she moved to Columbia, South  Carolina takin' me with her. I stayed with her about four years. This  wus the end of my maiden life. I married Isaac Austin of Richmond  County, Georgia. He wus a native of Warrenton County and he brought me  from his home in Richmond County, Georgia to Warrenton and then from  Warrenton to Raleigh. I had two brothers and thirteen sisters. I did  general house work, and helped raise children during slavery, and right  after de war. Then you had to depend on yourself to do for children. You  had to doctor and care for them yourself. You just had to depend on  yourself.    Dey had 320 acres o' cleared fields in Georgia and then de rice fields,  I just don't know how many acres. I have seen jails for slaves. Dey had  a basement for a jail in Georgia and a guard at de holes in it.    No, No! you better not be caught tryin' to do somethin' wid a book. Dey  would teach you wid a stick or switch. De slaves had secret prayer  meetin's wid pots turned down to kill de soun' o' de singin'. We sang a  song, 'I am glad salvation's free.' Once dey heard us, nex' mornin' dey  took us and tore our backs to pieces. Dey would say, 'Are you free? What  were you singin' about freedom?' While de niggers were bein' whupped  they said, 'Pray, marster, pray.'    The doctor came to see us sometimes when we were sick, but not after.  People just had to do their own doctorin'. Sometimes a man would take  his patient, and sit by de road where de doctor travelled, and when he  come along he would see him. De doctor rode in a sully drawn by a horse.  He had a route, one doctor to two territories.    When de white folks were preparing to go to de war they had big dinners  and speakin'. Dey tole what dey were goin' to do to Sherman and Grant. A  lot of such men as Grant and Sherman and Lincoln came through de South  in rags and were at some o' dese meetings, an' et de dinners. When de  white folks foun' it out, dere wus some sick folks. Sometimes we got two  days Christmas and two days July. When de nigger wus freed dey didn't  know where to go and what to do. It wus hard, but it has been hard  since. From what de white folks, marster and missus tole us we thought  Lincoln wus terrible. By what mother and father tole me I thought he wus  all right. I think Roosevelt wus put in by God to do the right things.    EH          N. C. District:     No. 2               [320012]  Worker:             Mary A.

Yes'um, I 'longed ter Marse Henry Allen of Wilson County an' we always  raise terbacker. Marse Henry wus good ter us so we had a heap of prayer  meetin's an' corn shuckin's an' such.    I 'members de big meetin's dat we'd have in de summer time an' dat good  singin' we'd have when we'd be singin' de sinners through. We'd stay  pretty nigh all night to make a sinner come through, an' maybe de week  atter de meetin' he'd steal one of his marster's hogs. Yes'um, I'se had  a bad time.    You know, missy, dar ain't no use puttin' faith in nobody, dey'd fool  you ever time anyhow. I know once a patteroller tol' me dat iffen I'd  give him a belt I found dat he'd let me go by ter see my gal dat night,  but when he kotch me dat night he whupped me. I tol' Marse Henry on him  too so Marse Henry takes de belt away from him an' gives me a possum fer  hit. Dat possum shore wus good too, baked in de ashes like I done it.    I ain't never hear Marse Henry cuss but once an' dat wus de time dat  some gentlemens come ter de house an' sez dat dar am a war 'twixt de  north an' de south. He sez den, 'Let de damn yaller bellied Yankees come  on an' we'll give 'em hell an' sen' dem a-hoppin' back ter de north in a  hurry.'    We ain't seed no Yankees 'cept a few huntin' Rebs. Dey talk mean ter us  an' one of dem says dat we niggers am de cause of de war. 'Sir,' I sez,  'folks what am a wantin' a war can always find a cause'. He kicks me in  de seat of de pants fer dat, so I hushes.    I stayed wid Marse Henry till he died den I moved ter Wilson. I has  worked everwhere, terbacker warehouses an' ever'thing.

I have neuritis, an' have been unable to work any fer a year  and fer seven years I couldn't do much.    My mother wus named Teeny McIntire and my father William McIntire.  Mammy belonged to Bryant Newkirk in Duplin County. Pap belonged to  someone else, I don't know who.    Dey said dey worked from light till dark, and pap said dey beat him so  bad he run away a lot o' times. Dey said de paterollers come to whare  dey wus havin' prayer meetin' and beat 'em.    Mammy said sometimes dey were fed well and others dey almost starved.  Dey got biscuit once a week on Sunday. Dey said dey went to de white  folks's church. Dey said de preachers tole 'em dey had to obey dere  missus and marster. My mammy said she didn't go to no dances 'cause she  wus crippled. Some o' de help, a colored woman, stole something when she  wus hongry. She put it off on mother and missus made mother wear  trousers for a year to punish her.    Mammy said dey gave de slaves on de plantation one day Christmas and  dat New Years wus when dey sold 'em an' hired 'em out. All de slaves wus  scared 'cause dey didn't know who would have to go off to be sold or to  work in a strange place. Pap tole me 'bout livin' in de woods and 'bout  dey ketchin' him. I 'member his owner's name den, it wus Stanley. He run  away so bad dey sold him several times. Pap said one time dey caught him  and nearly beat him to death, and jest as soon as he got well and got a  good chance he ran away again.    Mammy said when de Yankees come through she wus 'fraid of 'em. De  Yankees tole her not to be 'fraid of 'em. Dey say to her, 'Do dey treat  you right', Mammy said 'Yes sir', 'cause ole missus wus standin' dere,  an' she wus 'fraid not to say yes. Atter de war, de fust year atter de  surrender dey moved to James Alderman's place in Duplin County and  stayed dere till I wus a grown gal.    Den we moved to Goldsboro. Father wus a carpenter and he got a lot of  dat work. Dat's what he done in Goldsboro. We come from Goldsboro to  Raleigh and we have lived here every since. We moved here about de year  o' de shake and my mother died right here in Raleigh de year o' de  shake. Some of de things mother tole me 'bout slavery, has gone right  out of my min'. Jes comes and goes.    I remember pap tellin' me' bout stretchin' vines acrost roads and paths  to knock de patterollers off deir horses when dey were tryin' to ketch  slaves. Pap and mammy tole me marster and missus did not 'low any of de  slaves to have a book in deir house. Dat if dey caught a slave wid a  book in deir house dey whupped 'em. Dey were keerful not to let 'em  learn readin' and writin'.    Dey sold my sister Lucy and my brother Fred in slavery time, an' I have  never seen 'em in my life. Mother would cry when she was tellin' me  'bout it. She never seen 'em anymore. I jes' couldn't bear to hear her  tell it widout cryin'. Dey were carried to Richmond, an' sold by old  marster when dey were chillun.    We tried to get some news of brother and sister. Mother kept 'quiring  'bout 'em as long as she lived and I have hoped dat I could hear from  'em. Dey are dead long ago I recons, and I guess dare aint no use ever  expectin' to see 'em. Slavery wus bad and Mr. Lincoln did a good thing  when he freed de niggers. I caint express my love for Roosevelt. He has  saved so many lives. I think he has saved mine. I want to see him face  to face. I purely love him and I feel I could do better to see him and  tell him so face to face.    LE          N. C. District: No. 2                    [3201"]]]
