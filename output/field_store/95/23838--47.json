The viper[6] which leads afield the Milanese will  not make for her so fair a sepulture as the cock of Gallura would  have done.\" Thus he said, marked in his aspect with the stamp of  that upright zeal which in due measure glows in the heart.    [1] The sun was already hidden behind the mountain when Virgil  and Dante came upon Sordello. Sordello had not therefore seen  that Dante cast a shadow, and being absorbed in discourse with  Virgil had not observed that Dante breathed as a living man.    [2] Corrado, of the great Guelph family of the Malaspina, lords  of the Lunigiana, a wide district between Genoa and Pisa.    [3] The reason of that which He wills.    [4] Her mother was Beatrice d' Este, who, in 1300, married  Galeazzo de' Visconti of Milan.    [5] The white veil or wimple and black garments were worn by  widows. The prophecy that she must needs wish for her white  wimple again seems merely to rest on Nino's disapproval of her  second marriage.    [6] The viper was the cognizance of the Visconti of Milan.      My greedy eyes were going ever to the sky, ever there where the  stars are slowest, even as a wheel nearest the axle. And my  Leader, \"Son, at what lookest thou up there?\" And I to him, \"At  those three torches with which the pole on this side is all  aflame.\" [1] And he to me, \"The four bright stars which thou  sawest this morning are low on the other side, and these are  risen where those were.\"    [1] These three stars are supposed to symbolize the theological  virtues, -- faith. hope, and charity, whose light shines when the  four virtues of active life grow dim in night.      As he was speaking, lo! Sordello drew him to himself, saying,  \"See there our adversary,\" and pointed his finger that he should  look thither. At that part where the little valley has no barrier  was a snake, perhaps such as gave to Eve the bitter food. Through  the grass and the flowers came the evil trail, turning from time  to time its head to its  back, licking like a beast that sleeks  itself. I did not see, and therefore cannot tell how the  celestial falcons moved, but I saw well both one and the other in  motion. Hearing the air cleft by their green wings the serpent  fled, and the angels wheeled about, up to their stations flying  back alike.    The shade which had drawn close to the Judge when he exclaimed,  through all that assault had not for a moment loosed its gaze  from me. \"So may the light that leadeth thee on high find in  thine own free-will so much wax as is needed up to the enamelled  summit,\"[1] it began, \"if thou knowest true news of Valdimacra[2]  or of the neighboring region, tell it to me, for formerly I was  great there. I was called Corrado Malaspina; I am not the  ancient,[3] but from him I am descended; to mine own I bore the  love which here is refined.\" \"Oh,\" said I to him, \"through your  lands I have never been, but where doth man dwell in all Europe  that they are not renowned? The fame that honoreth your house  proclaims its lords, proclaims its district, so that he knows of  them who never yet was there; and I swear to you, so may I go  above, that your honored race doth not despoil itself of the  praise of the purse and of the sword. Custom and nature so  privilege it that though the guilty head turn the world awry,  alone it goes right and scorns the evil road.\"[4] And he, \"Now  go, for the sun shall not lie seven times in the bed that the Ram  covers and bestrides with all four feet,[5] before this courteous  opinion will be nailed in the middle of thy head with greater  nails than the speech of another, if course of judgment be not  arrested.\"    [1] So may illuminating grace find the disposition in thee  requisite for the support of its light, until thou shalt arrive  at the summit of the Mountain, the earthly Paradise enamelled  with perpetual flowers.    [2] A part of the Lunigiana.    [3] The old Corrado Malaspina was the husband of Constance, the  sister of King Manfred. He died about the middle of the  thirteenth century. The second Corrado was his grandson.    [4] This magnificent eulogy of the land and the family of  Malaspina is Dante's return for the hospitality which, in 1306,  he received from the Marquis Moroello and other members of the  house.    [5] Seven years shall not pass, the sun being at this time in the  sign of the Ram.        CANTO IX. Slumber and Dream of Dante.--The Eagle.--Lucia.--The  Gate of Purgatory.--The Angelic Gatekeeper.--Seven P's inscribed  on Dante's Forehead.--Entrance to the First Ledge.      The concubine of old Tithonus was now gleaming white on the  balcony of the orient, forth from the arms of her sweet friend;  her forehead was lucent with gems set in the shape of the cold  animal that strikes people with its tail.[1] And in the place  where we were the night had taken two of the steps with which she  ascends, and the third was already bending down its wings, when  I, who had somewhat of Adam with me, overcome by sleep, reclined  upon the grass, there where all five of us were seated.    [1] By the concubine of old Tithonus, Dante seems to have  intended the lunar Aurora, in distinction from the proper wife of  Tithonus, Aurora, who precedes the rising Sun, and the meaning of  these verses is that \" the Aurora before moonrise was lighting up  the eastern sky, the brilliant stars of the sign Scorpio were on  the horizon, and, finally, it was shortly after 8.30 P.M.\"  (Moore.) \"The steps with which the night ascends\" are the six  hours of the first half of the night, from 6 P.M. to midnight.      At the hour near the morning when the little swallow begins her  sad lays,[1] perchance in memory of her former woes, and when our  mind, more a wanderer from the flesh and less captive to the  thought, is in its visions almost divine,[2] in dream it seemed  to me that I saw poised in the sky an eagle with feathers of  gold, with wings widespread, and intent to stoop. And it seemed  to me that I was there[3] where his own people were abandoned by  Ganymede, when he was rapt to the supreme consistory. In myself I  thought, \"Perhaps this bird strikes only here through wont, and  perhaps from other place disdains to carry anyone upward in his  feet.\" Then it seemed to me that, having wheeled a little, it  descended terrible as a thunderbolt, and snatched me upwards far  as the fire.[4] There it seemed that it and I burned, and the  imagined fire so scorched that of necessity the sleep was broken.    [1] The allusion is to the tragic story of Progne and Philomela,  turned the one into a swallow, the other into a nightingale.  Dante found the tale in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book vi.    [2] Dante passes three nights in Purgatory, and each night his  sleep is terminated by a dream towards the hour of dawn, the time  when, according to the belief of classical antiquity, the visions  of dreams are symbolic and prophetic. (Moore.)    [3] Mt. Ida.    [4] The sphere of fire by which, according to the mediaeval  cosmography, the sphere of the air was surrounded.      Not otherwise Achilles shook himself,--turning around his  awakened eyes, and not knowing where he was, when his mother from  Chiron to Scyros stole him away, sleeping in her arms, thither  whence afterwards the Greeks withdrew him,[1]--than I started,  as from my face sleep fled away; and I became pale, even as a man  frightened turns to ice. At my side was my Comforter only, and  the sun was now more than two hours high,[2] and my face was  turned toward the sea. \"Have no fear,\" said my Lord; \"be  reassured, for we are at a good point; restrain not, but increase  all thy force. Thou art now arrived at Purgatory; see there the  cliff that closes it around; see the entrance, there where it  appears divided. A while ago in the dawn that precedes the day,  when thy soul was sleeping within thee, upon the flowers  wherewith the place down yonder is adorned, came a lady, and  said, \"I am Lucia; let me take this one who is sleeping; thus  will I assist him along his way.' Sordello remained, and the  other gentle forms: she took thee, and when the day was bright,  she came upward, and I along her footprints. Here she laid thee  down: and first her beautiful eyes showed me that open entrance;  then she and slumber went away together.\" Like a man that in  perplexity is reassured, and that alters his fear to confidence  after the truth is disclosed to him, did I change; and when my  Leader saw me without solicitude, up along the cliff he moved on,  and I behind, toward the height.    [1] Statius, in the first book of the Achilleid, tells how  Thetis, to prevent Achilles from going to the siege of Troy, bore  him sleeping away from his instructor, the centaur Chiron, and  carried him to the court of King Lycomedes, on the Island of  Scyros, where, though concealed in women's garments, Ulysses and  Diomed discovered him. Statius relates how wonderstruck Achilles  was when on awaking he found himself at Scyros:     Quae loca? qui fluctus? ubi Pelion? onmia versa      Atque ignota videt, dubitatque agnoscere matrem--249-50.    [2] The morning of Easter Monday.    [3] Lucia seems to be here the symbol of assisting grace, the  gratia operans of the school-men. It was she who was called upon  by the Virgin (Hell, Canto II.) to aid Dante when he was astray  in the wood, and who had moved Beatrice to go to his succor.      Reader, thou seest well how I exalt my theme, and therefore  marvel not if with more art I reenforce it.[1]    [1] These words may be intended to call attention to the doctrine  which underlies the imagery of the verse.    The entrance within the gate of Purgatory is the assurance of  justification, which is the change of the soul from a state of  sin to a state of justice or righteousness. Justification itself  consists, according to St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica,  Prima Secundae, quaest. cxiii. art. 6 and 8), of four parts:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#8)"],[1,"  Now that which was behind thee is before thee, but that   thou mayest know that I have joy in thee, I wish that thou cloak  thee with a corollary.[13] Nature, if she find fortune discordant  with herself, like every other seed out of its region, always  makes bad result. And if the world down there would fix attention  on the foundation which nature lays, following that, it would  have its people good. But ye wrest to religion one who shall be  born to gird on the sword, and ye make a king of one who is for  preaching; wherefore your track is out of the road.\"    [1] Is seen in the mind of God.    [2] My own joy is the dearer in that thou seest that it is more  grateful to me because known by thee.    [3] The providence of God is fulfilled through the influences of  the Heavens acting upon the natures subject to them.    [4] That is, together with the good ends for which they are  created and ordained.    [5] Defect in the subordinate Intelligences would imply defect in  God, which is impossible.    [6] It is impossible that the order of nature should fail, that  order being the design of God in creation.    [7] That is, united with other men in society.    [8] Because man is by nature a social animal, and cannot attain  his true end except as a member of a community.    [9] Society cannot exist without diversity in the functions of  its members.    [10] Aristotle, \"the master of human reason, who treats of this  in many places, for instance in his Ethics, i. 7, where he speaks  of man as \"by nature social,\" so that his end is accomplished  only in society.    [11] Human dispositions, the roots of human works, must be  diverse in order to produce diverse effects.    [12] The spheres pour down their various influences without  discrimination in the choice of the individual upon whom they  fall. Hence sons may differ in their dispositions from their  fathers.    [13] This additional statement completes the instruction, as a  cloak completes the clothing of a body.        CANTO IX. The Heaven of Venus.--Conversation of Dante with  Cunizza da Romano,--With Folco of Marseilles.--Rahab.--Avarice of  the Papal Court.    After thy Charles, O beautiful Clemence,[1] had enlightened me,  he told to me of the treasons which his seed must suffer. But he  said, \"Be silent, and let the years revolve:\" so that I can tell  nothing, save that just lament shall follow on your wrongs.[2]    [1] The widow of Charles Martel.    [2] Those who have done the wrong shall justly lament therefor.      And now the life of that holy light had turned again unto the Sun  which fills it, as that Good which suffices for every thing. Ah,  souls deceived, and creatures impious, who from such Good turn  away your hearts, directing your foreheads unto vanity!    And lo! another of those splendors made towards me, and in  brightening outwardly was signifying its will to please me. The  eyes of Beatrice, which were fixed upon me, as before, made me  assured of dear assent to my desire. \"I pray thee give swift  quittance to my wish, blessed spirit,\" I said, \"and afford me  proof that what think I can reflect on thee.\"[1] Whereon the  light which was still new[2] to me, from out its depth, wherein  erst it was singing, proceeded, as one whom doing good delights,  \"In that part[3] of the wicked Italian land, which lies between  Rialto and the founts of the Brenta and the Piave, rises a  hill,[4] and mounts not very high, whence a torch descended which  made a great assault upon that district. From one root both I and  it were born; Cunizza was I called; and I am refulgent here  because the light of this star overcame me. But gladly do I  pardon to myself the cause of my lot, and it gives me no  annoy;[5] which perhaps would seem difficult to your vulgar. Of  this resplendent and dear jewel of our kingdom,[6] who is nearest  to me, great fame has remained, and ere it die away this  hundredth year shall yet come round five times. See if man ought  to make himself excellent, so that the first may leave another  life! And this the present crowd, which the Tagliameuto and the  Adige shut in,[7] considers not; nor yet by being scourged doth  it repent. But it will soon come to pass that at the marsh Padua  will discolor the water which bathes Vicenza, because her people  are stubborn against duty.[8] And where the Sile and the Cagnano  unite, one lords it, and goes with his head high, for catching  whom the web is already spun.[9] Feltro will yet weep the crime  of its impious shepherd, which will be so shameful, that, for a  like, none ever entered Malta.[10] Too large would be the vat  which would hold the Ferrarese blood, and weary he who should  weigh it, ounce by ounce, which this courteous priest will give  to show himself a partisan;[11] and such gifts will be conformed  to the living of the country. Above are mirrors, ye call them  Thrones,[12] wherefrom God shines on us in his judgments, so  that these words seem good to us.\"[13] Here she was silent, and  had to me the semblance of being turned elsewhither by the wheel  in which she set herself as she was before.[14]    [1] That thou, gazing on the mind of God, seest therein my  thoughts.    [2] Still unknown by name.    [3] The March of Treviso, lying between Venice (Rialto) and the  Alps.    [4] The hill on which stood the little stronghold of Romano, the  birthplace of the tyrant Azzolino, or Ezzolino, whom Dante had  seen in Hell (Canto XII.) punished for his cruel misdeeds, in the  river of boiling blood. Cunizza was his sister.    [5] The sin which has limited the capacity of bliss, the sin  which has determined the low grade in Paradise of Cunizza, is  forgiven and forgotten, and she, like Piccarda, wishes only for  that blessedness which she has.    [6] Folco, or Foulquet, of Marseilles, once a famous singer of  songs of love, then a bishop. He died in 1213.    [7] The people of the region where Cunizza lived.    [8] The Paduan Guelphs, resisting the Emperor, to whom they owed  duty, were defeated more than once, near Vicenza, by Can Grande,  during the years in which Dante was writing his poem.    [9] The Sile and the Cagnano unite at Treviso, whose lord,  Ricciardo da Camino, was assassinated in 1312.    [10] An act of treachery on the part of the Bishop and Lord of  Feltro, Alessandro Novello, in delivering up Ghibelline exiles  from Ferrara, of whom thirty were beheaded; a treason so vile  that in the tower called Malta, where ecclesiastics who committed  capital crimes were imprisoned, no such crime as his was ever  punished.    [11] That is, of the Guelphs, by whom the designation of The  Party was appropriated.    [12] The Thrones were, according to St. Gregory, that order of  Angels through whom God executes his judgments.    [13] Because we see reflected from the Thrones the judgment of  God above to fall on the guilty.    [14] See Canto VIII., near the beginning.      The next joy, which was already known to me as an illustrious  thing,[1] became to my sight like a fine ruby whereon the sun  should strike. Through joy effulgence is gained there on high,  even as a smile here; but below[2] the shade darkens outwardly,  as the mind is sad.    [1] By the words of Cunizza.    [2] In Hell.      \"God sees everything, and thy vision, blessed spirit, is in Him,\"  said I, \"so that no wish can steal itself away from thee. Thy  voice, then, that ever charms the heavens, with the song of those  pious fires which make a cowl for themselves with their six  wings,[1] why does it not satisfy my desires? Surely I should not  wait for thy request if I in-theed myself, as thou thyself  in-meest.\"[2] \"The greatest deep in which the water spreads,\"[3]  began then his words, \"except of that sea which garlands the  earth, between its discordant shores stretches so far counter to  the sun, that it makes a meridian where first it was wont to make  the horizon.[4] I was a dweller on the shore of that deep,  between the Ebro and the Magra,[5] which, for a short way,  divides the Genoese from the Tuscan. With almost the same sunset  and the same sunrise sit Buggea and the city whence I was, which  once made its harbor warm with its own blood.[6] That people to  whom my name was known called me Folco, and this heaven is  imprinted by me, as I was by it. For the daughter of Belus,[7]  harmful alike to Sichaeus and Creusa, burned not more than I, so  long as it befitted my hair;[8] nor she of Rhodopea who was  deluded by Demophoon;[9] nor Alcides when he had enclosed Iole in  his heart.[10] Yet one repents not here, but smiles, not for the  fault which returns not to the memory, but for the power which  ordained and foresaw. Here one gazes upon the art which adorns so  great a work, and the good is discerned whereby the world above  turns that below.    [1] The Seraphim, who with their wings cover their faces. See  Isaiah, vi. 2.    [2] If I saw thee inwardly as thou seest me. Dante invents the  words he uses here, and they are no less unfamiliar in Italian  than in English.    [3] The Mediterranean.    [4] According to the geography of the time the Mediterranean  stretched from east to west ninety degrees of longitude.    [5] Between the Ebro in Spain and the Magra in Italy lies  Marseilles, under almost the same meridian as Buggea (now Bougie)  on the African coast.

[9] Phyllis, daughter of the king of Thrace, who hung herself  when deserted by Demophoon, the son of Theseus.    [10] The excess of the love of Hercules for Iole led to his  death.      \"But in order that thou mayst bear away satisfied all thy wishes  which have been born in this sphere, it behoves me to proceed  still further. Thou wouldst know who is in this light, which  beside me here so sparkles, as a sunbeam on clear water. Now know  that therewithin Rahab[1] "]]]
