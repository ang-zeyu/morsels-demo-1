The captain and the sergeant    The men they did divide;    They fired from behind him    And also from each side;    It's six police he did shoot down    Before the fatal ball    Did pierce the heart of Donahoo    And cause bold Jack to fall.      And when he fell, he closed his eyes,    He bid the world adieu;    Come, all you boys, and sing the song    Of bold Jack Donahoo.          UTAH CARROLL        And as, my friend, you ask me what makes me sad and still,    And why my brow is darkened like the clouds upon the hill;    Run in your pony closer and I'll tell to you the tale    Of Utah Carroll, my partner, and his last ride on the trail.      'Mid the cactus and the thistles of Mexico's fair lands,    Where the cattle roam in thousands, a-many a herd and brand,    There is a grave with neither headstone, neither date nor name,--    There lies my partner sleeping in the land from which I came.      We rode the range together and had rode it side by side;    I loved him as a brother, I wept when Utah died;    We were rounding up one morning, our work was almost done,    When on the side the cattle started on a mad and fearless run.      The boss man's little daughter was holding on that side.    She rushed; the cattle saw the blanket, they charged with        maddened fear.    And little Varro, seeing the danger, turned her pony a pace    And leaning in the saddle, tied the blanket in its place.      In leaning, she lost her balance and fell in front of that wild tide.    Utah's voice controlled the round-up. \"Lay still, little Varro,\" he        cried.    His only hope was to raise her, to catch her at full speed,    And oft-times he had been known to catch the trail rope off his steed.      His pony reached the maiden with a firm and steady bound;    Utah swung out from the saddle to catch her from the ground.    He swung out from the saddle, I thought her safe from harm,    As he swung in his saddle to raise her in his arm.      But the cinches of his saddle had not been felt before,    And his back cinch snapt asunder and he fell by the side of Varro.    He picked up the blanket and swung it over his head    And started across the prairie; \"Lay still, little Varro,\" he said.      Well, he got the stampede turned and saved little Varro, his        friend.    Then he turned to face the cattle and meet his fatal end.    His six-shooter from his pocket, from the scabbard he quickly drew,--    He was bound to die defended as all young cowboys do.      His six-shooter flashed like lightning, the report rang loud and clear;    As the cattle rushed in and killed him he dropped the leading steer.    And when we broke the circle where Utah's body lay,    With many a wound and bruise his young life ebbed away.      \"And in some future morning,\" I heard the preacher say,    \"I hope we'll all meet Utah at the round-up far away.\"    Then we wrapped him in a blanket sent by his little friend,    And it was that very red blanket that brought him to his end.          THE BULL-WHACKER        I'm a lonely bull-whacker    On the Red Cloud line,    I can lick any son of a gun    That will yoke an ox of mine.    And if I can catch him,    You bet I will or try,    I'd lick him with an ox-bow,--    Root hog or die.      It's out on the road    With a very heavy load,    With a very awkward team    And a very muddy road,    You may whip and you may holler,    But if you cuss it's on the sly;    Then whack the cattle on, boys,--    Root hog or die.      It's out on the road    These sights are to be seen,    The antelope and buffalo,    The prairie all so green,--    The antelope and buffalo,    The rabbit jumps so high;    It's whack the cattle on, boys,--    Root hog or die.      It's every day at twelve    There's something for to do;    And if there's nothing else,    There's a pony for to shoe;    I'll throw him down,    And still I'll make him lie;    Little pig, big pig,    Root hog or die.      Now perhaps you'd like to know    What we have to eat,    A little piece of bread    And a little dirty meat,    A little black coffee,    And whiskey on the sly;    It's whack the cattle on, boys,--    Root hog or die.      There's hard old times on Bitter Creek    That never can be beat,    It was root hog or die    Under every wagon sheet;    We cleaned up all the Indians,    Drank all the alkali,    And it's whack the cattle on, boys,--    Root hog or die.      There was good old times in Salt Lake    That never can pass by,    It was there I first spied    My China girl called Wi.    She could smile, she could chuckle,    She could roll her hog eye;    Then it's whack the cattle on, boys,--    Root hog or die.      Oh, I'm going home    Bull-whacking for to spurn,    I ain't got a nickel,    And I don't give a dern.    'Tis when I meet a pretty girl,    You bet I will or try,    I'll make her my little wife,--    Root hog or die.          THE \"METIS\" SONG OF THE BUFFALO HUNTERS    BY ROBIDEAU        Hurrah for the buffalo hunters!        Hurrah for the cart brigade!    That creak along on its winding way,        While we dance and sing and play.    Hurrah, hurrah for the cart brigade!      Hurrah for the Pembinah hunters!        Hurrah for its cart brigade!    For with horse and gun we roll along        O'er mountain and hill and plain.    Hurrah, hurrah for the cart brigade!      We whipped the Sioux and scalped them too,        While on the western plain,    And rode away on our homeward way        With none to say us nay,--    Hurrah, hurrah for the cart brigade! Hurrah!      Mon ami, mon ami, hurrah for our black-haired girls!        That braved the Sioux and fought them too,    While on Montana's plains.        We'll hold them true and love them too,    While on the trail of the Pembinah, hurrah!        Hurrah, hurrah for the cart brigade of Pembinah!      We have the skins and the meat so sweet.        And we'll sit by the fire in the lodge so neat,    While the wind blows cold and the snow is deep.        Then roll in our robes and laugh as we sleep.    Hurrah, hurrah for the cart brigade! Hurrah!                Hurrah! Hurrah!          THE COWBOY'S LAMENT        As I walked out in the streets of Laredo,    As I walked out in Laredo one day,    I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen,    Wrapped up in white linen as cold as the clay.        \"Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,      Play the Dead March as you carry me along;      Take me to the green valley, there lay the sod o'er me,      For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.      \"I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy,\"    These words he did say as I boldly stepped by.    \"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;    I was shot in the breast and I know I must die.        \"Let sixteen gamblers come handle my coffin,      Let sixteen cowboys come sing me a song,      Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me,      For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong.      \"My friends and relations, they live in the Nation,    They know not where their boy has gone.    He first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,    Oh, I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.      \"Go write a letter to my gray-haired mother,    And carry the same to my sister so dear;    But not a word of this shall you mention    When a crowd gathers round you my story to hear.        \"Then beat your drum lowly and play your fife slowly,      Beat the Dead March as you carry me along;      We all love our cowboys so young and so handsome,      We all love our cowboys although they've done wrong.      \"There is another more dear than a sister,    She'll bitterly weep when she hears I am gone.    There is another who will win her affections,    For I'm a young cowboy and they say I've done wrong.      \"Go gather around you a crowd of young cowboys,    And tell them the story of this my sad fate;    Tell one and the other before they go further    To stop their wild roving before 'tis too late.        \"Oh, muffle your drums, then play your fifes merrily;      Play the Dead March as you go along.      And fire your guns right over my coffin;      There goes an unfortunate boy to his home.      \"It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing,    It was once in the saddle I used to go gay;    First to the dram-house, then to the card-house,    Got shot in the breast, I am dying to-day.      \"Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;    Get six pretty maidens to bear up my pall.    Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,    Put roses to deaden the clods as they fall.        \"Then swing your rope slowly and rattle your spurs lowly,      And give a wild whoop as you carry me along;      And in the grave throw me and roll the sod o'er me,      For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.      \"Go bring me a cup, a cup of cold water,    To cool my parched lips,\" the cowboy said;    Before I turned, the spirit had left him    And gone to its Giver,--the cowboy was dead.        We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,      And bitterly wept as we bore him along;      For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome,      We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.          LOVE IN DISGUISE        As William and Mary stood by the seashore    Their last farewell to take,    Returning no more, little Mary she said,    \"Why surely my heart will break.\"    \"Oh, don't be dismayed, little Mary,\" he said,    As he pressed the dear girl to his side,    \"In my absence don't mourn, for when I return    I'll make little Mary my bride.\"      Three years passed on without any news.    One day as she stood by the door    A beggar passed by with a patch on his eye,    \"I'm home, oh, do pity, my love;    Have compassion on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#8)"],[1,"nts. This  they do by every city along the river-bank; and when they come to  Bubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices, and more wine  of grapes is consumed upon that festival than during the whole of the  rest of the year. To this place (so say the natives) they come together  year by year even to the number of seventy myriads of men and women,  besides children. Thus it is done here; and how they celebrate the  festival in honour of Isis at the city of Busiris has been told by  me before: for, as I said, they beat themselves in mourning after the  sacrifice, all of them both men and women, very many myriads of people;  but for whom they beat themselves it is not permitted to me by religion  to say: and so many as there are of the Carians dwelling in Egypt do  this even more than the Egyptians themselves, inasmuch as they cut their  foreheads also with knives; and by this it is manifested that they are  strangers and not Egyptians. At the times when they gather together  at the city of Sais for their sacrifices, on a certain night they all  kindle lamps many in number in the open air round about the houses; now  the lamps are saucers full of salt and oil mixed, and the wick floats by  itself on the surface, and this burns during the whole night; and to  the festival is given the name _Lychnocaia_ (the lighting of lamps).  Moreover those of the Egyptians who have not come to this solemn  assembly observe the night of the festival and themselves also light  lamps all of them, and thus not in Sais alone are they lighted, but over  all Egypt: and as to the reason why light and honour are allotted to  this night, about this there is a sacred story told. To Heliopolis and  Buto they go year by year and do sacrifice only: but at Papremis they  do sacrifice and worship as elsewhere, and besides that, when the sun  begins to go down while some few of the priests are occupied with the  image of the god, the greater number of them stand in the entrance of  the temple with wooden clubs, and other persons to the number of more  than a thousand men with purpose to perform a vow, these also having  all of them staves of wood, stand in a body opposite to those: and the  image, which is in a small shrine of wood covered over with gold, they  take out on the day before to another sacred building. The few then  who have been left about the image, draw a wain with four wheels, which  bears the shrine and the image that is within the shrine, and the other  priests standing in the gateway try to prevent it from entering, and  the men who are under a vow come to the assistance of the god and strike  them, while the others defend themselves. Then there comes to be a  hard fight with staves, and they break one another's heads, and I am  of opinion that many even die of the wounds they receive; the Egyptians  however told me that no one died. This solemn assembly the people of the  place say that they established for the following reason:--the mother  of Ares, they say, used to dwell in this temple, and Ares, having been  brought up away from her, when he grew up came thither desiring to visit  his mother, and the attendants of his mother's temple, not having seen  him before, did not permit him to pass in, but kept him away; and  he brought men to help him from another city and handled roughly the  attendants of the temple, and entered to visit his mother. Hence, they  say, this exchange of blows has become the custom in honour of Ares upon  his festival.    The Egyptians were the first who made it a point of religion not to lie  with women in temples, nor to enter into temples after going away  from women without first bathing: for almost all other men except the  Egyptians and the Hellenes lie with women in temples and enter into a  temple after going away from women without bathing, since they hold that  there is no difference in this respect between men and beasts: for  they say that they see beasts and the various kinds of birds coupling  together both in the temples and in the sacred enclosures of the gods;  if then this were not pleasing to the god, the beasts would not do so.    Thus do these defend that which they do, which by me is disallowed:  but the Egyptians are excessively careful in their observances, both  in other matters which concern the sacred rites and also in those which  follow:--Egypt, though it borders upon Libya, does not very much abound  in wild animals, but such as they have are one and all accounted by them  sacred, some of them living with men and others not. But if I should say  for what reasons the sacred animals have been thus dedicated, I should  fall into discourse of matters pertaining to the gods, of which I most  desire not to speak; and what I have actually said touching slightly  upon them, I said because I was constrained by necessity. About these  animals there is a custom of this kind:--persons have been appointed of  the Egyptians, both men and women, to provide the food for each kind  of beast separately, and their office goes down from father to son; and  those who dwell in the various cities perform vows to them thus, that  is, when they make a vow to the god to whom the animal belongs, they  shave the head of their children either the whole or the half or the  third part of it, and then set the hair in the balance against silver,  and whatever it weighs, this the man gives to the person who provides  for the animals, and she cuts up fish of equal value and gives it for  food to the animals. Thus food for their support has been appointed and  if any one kill any of these animals, the penalty, if he do it with his  own will, is death, and if against his will, such penalty as the priests  may appoint: but whosoever shall kill an ibis or a hawk, whether it be  with his will or against his will, must die. Of the animals that live  with men there are great numbers, and would be many more but for the  accidents which befall the cats. For when the females have produced  young they are no longer in the habit of going to the males, and these  seeking to be united with them are not able. To this end then they  contrive as follows,--they either take away by force or remove secretly  the young from the females and kill them (but after killing they do not  eat them), and the females being deprived of their young and desiring  more, therefore come to the males, for it is a creature that is fond  of its young. Moreover when a fire occurs, the cats seem to be divinely  possessed; for while the Egyptians stand at intervals and look after  the cats, not taking any care to extinguish the fire, the cats slipping  through or leaping over the men, jump into the fire; and when this  happens, great mourning comes upon the Egyptians. And in whatever houses  a cat has died by a natural death, all those who dwell in this house  shave their eyebrows only, but those in which a dog has died shave their  whole body and also their head. The cats when they are dead are carried  away to sacred buildings in the city of Bubastis, where after being  embalmed they are buried; but the dogs they bury each people in their  own city in sacred tombs; and the ichneumons are buried just in the same  way as the dogs. The shrewmice however and the hawks they carry away to  the city of Buto, and the ibises to Hermopolis; the bears (which are not  commonly seen) and the wolves, not much larger in size than foxes, they  bury on the spot where they are found lying.    Of the crocodile the nature is as follows:--during the four most wintry  months this creature eats nothing: she has four feet and is an animal  belonging to the land and the water both; for she produces and hatches  eggs on the land, and the most part of the day she remains upon dry  land, but the whole of the night in the river, for the water in truth  is warmer than the unclouded open air and the dew. Of all the mortal  creatures of which we have knowledge this grows to the greatest bulk  from the smallest beginning; for the eggs which she produces are not  much larger than those of geese and the newly-hatched young one is in  proportion to the egg, but as he grows he becomes as much as seventeen  cubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those of a pig  and teeth large and tusky, in proportion to the size of his body; but  unlike all other beasts he grows no tongue, neither does he move his  lower jaw, but brings the upper jaw towards the lower, being in this too  unlike all other beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a scaly hide  upon his back which cannot be pierced; and he is blind in the water, but  in the air he is of a very keen sight. Since he has his living in the  water he keeps his mouth all full within of leeches; and whereas all  other birds and beasts fly from him, the trochilus is a creature which  is at peace with him, seeing that from her he receives benefit; for  the crocodile having come out of the water to the land and then having  opened his mouth (this he is wont to do generally towards the West  Wind), the trochilus upon that enters into his mouth and swallows down  the leeches, and he being benefited is pleased and does no harm to  the trochilus. Now for some of the Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred  animals, and for others not so, but they treat them on the contrary  as enemies: those however who dwell about Thebes and about the lake of  Moiris hold them to be most sacred, and each of these two peoples keeps  one crocodile selected from the whole number, which has been trained  to tameness, and they put hanging ornaments of molten stone and of gold  into the ears of these and anklets round the front feet, and they give  them food appointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well  as possible while they live, and after they are dead they bury them  in sacred tombs, embalming them: but those who dwell about the city  of Elephantine even eat them, not holding them to be sacred.
