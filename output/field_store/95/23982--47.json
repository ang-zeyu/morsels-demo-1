A bread peel was a universal gift to a bride; it was significant of  domestic utility and plenty, and was held to be luck-bearing. On  Thanksgiving week the great oven had a fire built in it every morning,  and every night it was well filled and closed till morning.    On one side of the kitchen often stood a dresser, on which was placed in  orderly rows the cheerful pewter and scant earthenware of the  household:--          \"----the room was bright      With glimpses of reflected light,      From plates that on the dresser shone.\"    In Dutch households plate-racks, spoon-racks, knife-racks,--all hanging  on the wall,--took the place of the New England dresser.    In the old Phillips farmhouse at Wickford, Rhode Island, is a splendid  chimney over twenty feet square. So much room does it occupy that there  is no central staircase, but little winding stairs ascend at three  corners of the house. In the vast fireplace an ox could literally have  been roasted. On each chimney-piece are hooks to hang firearms, and at  one side curious little drawers are set for pipes and tobacco. In some  Dutch houses in New York these tobacco shelves are in the entry, over  the front door, and a narrow flight of three or four steps leads up to  them. Hanging on a nail alongside the tobacco drawer, or shelf, would  usually be seen a pipe-tongs, or smoking-tongs. They were slender  little tongs, usually of iron or steel; with them the smoker lifted a  coal from the fireplace to light his pipe. The tongs owned and used by  Captain Joshua Wingate, of Hampton, New Hampshire, who lived from 1679  to 1769, are here shown. The handle is unlike any other I have seen,  having one end elongated, knobbed, and ingeniously bent S-shaped into  convenient form to press down the tobacco into the bowl of the pipe.  Other old-time pipe-tongs were in the form of lazy-tongs. A companion of  the pipe-tongs on the kitchen mantel was what was known as a  comfortier--a little brazier of metal in which small coals could be  handed about for pipe-lighting. An unusual luxury was a comfortier of  silver. These were found among the Dutch settlers.    The Pennsylvania Germans were the first to use stoves. These were of  various shapes. A curious one, seen in houses and churches, was of  sheet-metal, box-shaped; three sides were within the house, and the  fourth, with the stove door, outside the house. Thus what was really  the back of the stove projected into the room, and when the fire was fed  it was necessary for the tender to go out of doors. These German stoves  and hot-air drums, which heated the second story of the house, were ever  a fresh wonder to travellers of English birth and descent in  Pennsylvania. There is no doubt that their evident economy and comfort  suggested to Benjamin Franklin the \"New Pennsylvania Fireplace,\" which  he invented in 1742, in which both wood and coal could be used, and  which was somewhat like the heating apparatus which we now call a  Franklin stove, or heater.    Thus German settlers had, in respect to heating, the most comfortable  homes of all the colonies. Among the English settlers the kitchen was,  too often, the only comfortable room in the house in winter weather.  Indeed, the discomforts and inconveniences of a colonial home could  scarcely be endured to-day; of course these culminated in the winter  time, when icy blasts blew fiercely down the great chimneys, and rattled  the loosely fitting windows. Children suffered bitterly in these cold  houses. The rooms were not warm three feet away from the blaze of the  fire. Cotton Mather and Judge Samuel Sewall both tell, in their diaries,  of the ink freezing in their pens as they wrote within the  chimney-side. One noted that, when a great fire was built on the hearth,  the sap forced out of the wood by the flames froze into ice at the end  of the logs. The bedrooms were seldom warmed, and had it not been for  the deep feather beds and heavy bed-curtains, would have been  unendurable. In Dutch and some German houses, with alcove bedsteads, and  sleeping on one feather bed, with another for cover, the Dutch settlers  could be far warmer than any English settlers, even in four-post  bedsteads curtained with woollen.    Water froze immediately if left standing in bedrooms. One diary, written  in Marshfield, Massachusetts, tells of a basin of water standing on the  bedroom hearth, in front of a blazing fire, in which the water froze  solid. President John Adams so dreaded the bleak New England winter and  the ill-warmed houses that he longed to sleep like a dormouse every  year, from autumn to spring. In the Southern colonies, during the fewer  cold days of the winter months, the temperature was not so low, but the  houses were more open and lightly built than in the North, and were  without cellars, and had fewer fireplaces; hence the discomfort from the  cold was as great, if not the positive suffering.    The first chilling entrance into the ice-cold bed of a winter bedroom  was sometimes mitigated by heating the inner sheets with a warming-pan.  This usually hung by the side of the kitchen fireplace, and when used  was filled with hot coals, and thrust within the bed, and constantly and  rapidly moved back and forth to keep from scorching the bed-linen. The  warming-pan was a circular metal pan about a foot in diameter, four or  five inches deep, with a long wooden handle and a perforated metal  cover, usually of copper or brass, which was kept highly polished, and  formed, as it hung on the wall, one of the cheerful kitchen discs to  reflect the light of the glowing fire. The warming-pan has been deemed  of sufficient decorative capacity to make it eagerly sought after by  collectors, and a great room of one of these collectors is hung entirely  around the four walls with a frieze of warming-pans.    Many of our New England poets have given us glimpses in rhyme of the  old-time kitchen. Lowell's well-known lines are vivid enough to bear  never-dying quotation:--        \"A fireplace filled the rooms one side        With half a cord of wood in--      There warn't no stoves (tell comfort died)        To bake ye to a puddin'.        \"The wa'nut log shot sparkles out        Towards the pootiest--bless her!      An' little flames danced all about        The chiny on the dresser.        \"Agin the crumbly crooknecks hung,        An' in amongst 'em rusted      The old queen's-arm that granther Young        Fetched back from Concord busted.\"    To me the true essence of the old-time fireside is found in Whittier's  _Snow-Bound_. The very chimney, fireplace, and hearthstone of which his  beautiful lines were written, the kitchen of Whittier's boyhood's home,  at East Haverhill, Massachusetts, is shown in the accompanying  illustration. It shows a swinging crane. His description of the \"laying  the fire\" can never be equalled by any prose:--        \"We piled with care our nightly stack      Of wood against the chimney back--      The oaken log, green, huge, and thick,      And on its top the stout back-stick;      The knotty fore-stick laid apart,      And filled between with curious art      The ragged brush; then hovering near,      We watched the first red blaze appear,      Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam      On whitewashed wall and sagging beam,      Until the old, rude-furnished room      Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom.\"    No greater picture of homely contentment could be shown than the  following lines:--        \"Shut in from all the world without,      We sat the clean-winged hearth about,      Content to let the north wind roar      In baffled rage at pane and door,      While the red logs before us beat      The frost-line back with tropic heat;      And ever, when a louder blast      Shook beam and rafter as it passed,      The merrier up its roaring draught      The great throat of the chimney laughed.      The house dog on his paws outspread      Laid to the fire his drowsy head,      The cat's dark silhouette on the wall      A couchant tiger's seemed to fall;      And, for the winter fireside meet,      Between the andirons' straddling feet      The mug of cider simmered slow,      And apples sputtered in a row.      And, close at hand, the basket stood      With nuts from brown October's woods.      What matter how the night behaved!      What matter how the north wind raved!      Blow high, blow low, not all its snow      Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow.\"    Nor can the passing of years dim the ruddy glow of that hearth-fire, nor  the charm of the poem. The simplicity of metre, the purity of wording,  the gentle sadness of some of its expressions, make us read between the  lines the deep and affectionate reminiscence with which it was written.          CHAPTER IV    THE SERVING OF MEALS      Perhaps no greater difference exists between any mode of the olden times  and that of to-day, than can be seen in the manner of serving the meals  of the family. In the first place, the very dining-table of the  colonists was not like our present ones; it was a long and narrow board,  sometimes but three feet wide, with no legs attached to it. It was laid  on supports or trestles, shaped usually something like a saw-horse. Thus  it was literally a board, and was called a table-board, and the linen  cover used at meals was not called a tablecloth, but a board-cloth or  board-clothes.    As smoothly sawed and finished boards were not so plentiful at first in  the colonies as might naturally be thought when we remember the vast  encircling forests, all such boards were carefully treasured, and used  many times to avoid sawing others by the tedious and wearying process of  pit-sawing. Hence portions of packing-boxes, or chests which had carried  stores from England to the colonies, were made into table-boards. One  such oaken table-board, still in existence, has on the under side in  quaint lettering the name and address of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],[0,"Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#8)"],[1,"would expose herself to a {29} Bulgarian assault;  and with a considerable portion of her forces engaged in Gallipoli, and  no prospect either of Servian or of Rumanian assistance, how was she to  face that assault?    The King's disapproval was known to no one better than to M. Venizelos  himself.  But, for all that, he felt entitled to tell the British  Minister at Athens that he had the King's assent.  Here is his own  explanation: \"The King was opposed to the enterprise.  I sought another  interview in order to speak to him again on the subject, and took with me  a third memorandum\"--which has never been published, and cannot yet be  published.  \"I asked him to let me read it to him, for in it were set  forth fully all the arguments which, in my opinion, imposed co-operation.  I read it.  I saw that the King became agitated.  For--I must do him that  justice--he rarely remained unconvinced when face to face with me.  So  profound was the emotion with which I spoke, so powerful were the  arguments which I used that the King, greatly moved, said to me: 'Well,  then, in the name of God.'  That is, he assented.\" [14]    However, the General Staff remained unconvinced; and Colonel Metaxas, a  brilliant soldier, then Acting-Chief of the Staff, resigned as a protest  against military proposals being made by a Greek minister to other  countries without previous consultation with the military experts of his  own.  M. Venizelos, on his part, was indignant that mere soldiers should  presume to meddle with the plans of statesmen; his view being that the  Staff's business was simply to carry out the policy of the Government.  Nevertheless, impressed by this resignation, he suggested the meeting of  a Crown Council composed of all the ex-Premiers, that their opinions  might be heard.  The Council met on 3 March and again on 5 March.  At the  first sitting M. Venizelos admitted that the objections of the military  experts, without altering his own convictions, might still inspire doubt  as to which policy was preferable: neutrality or intervention.  Should  the policy of neutrality be adopted, it must be carried on by a new  Cabinet, to which he would accord his parliamentary support.  At the  second sitting he endeavoured to remove the objections of the military  experts by reducing his proposed contribution to the {30} Gallipoli  expedition from three divisions to one, which should be replaced in the  existing cadres by a division of reserves, so as to leave the Greek Army  practically intact against a possible attack from Bulgaria.  And having  thus modified the conditions of intervention, he refused to entertain any  other policy or to support a Cabinet pledged to neutrality.[15]    Momentarily infected by the Cretan's enthusiasm, nearly all present urged  upon the King the acceptance of his proposal; one of them, M. Rallis,  even going so far as to say: \"Sire, pray consider that you have a  Government clothed with the full confidence of the nation.  Let it carry  out its policy.  Else, you will incur undue responsibility.\"  The King's  answer was: \"If you wish it, I will abdicate.\" [16]  He would rather give  up his crown than assume the responsibility of sanctioning a policy which  his whole military training and experience told him was insane and  suicidal: how justly, the event soon showed.  The losses of men and ships  which Gallipoli cost far exceeded the whole of Greece's military and  naval resources; and if that cost proved more than embarrassing to  England and France, it would have literally ruined Greece.  M. Rallis and  the other ex-Premiers in less than a fortnight gratefully recognised the  justness of the King's opposition to their views,[17] and thenceforth  parted company with M. Venizelos.    Meanwhile M. Venizelos hastened from the Palace to the British Legation,  and, \"in order to save time till he could make an official _demarche_,\"  he made to the Entente Ministers there assembled a semi-official  communication to this effect: \"Following the natural evolution of its  policy of solidarity with the Entente Powers, the Royal Government has  judged that the Dardanelles operations afford it a favourable occasion to  translate its sentiments into deeds by abandoning its neutrality and  offering its co-operation in that enterprise with the whole of its Fleet  and one division of its army.\"  All this, \"though the King {31} has not  yet given his adhesion.\" [18]  His hurry arose from the belief that the  Allies would reach Constantinople in a few days.    But the General Staff still remained unconvinced.  Yes, they said, one  division to begin with; but what if the Allies get stuck in the Straits,  as we believe they will be, and call upon us for more?  And, once we join  them, how can we refuse to supply their needs?  We shall be incurring  unlimited liabilities.  So the King, who had full confidence in his  military advisers, and who could not bring himself to look upon the  Gallipoli adventure as a \"serious enterprise,\" [19] declined his adhesion  to M. Venizelos's plan; and M. Venizelos resigned in wrath (6 March).    Then came the Entente replies to his communication; from which it  appeared that, as in August, 1914, so now the impetuous Cretan ran ahead  of the Powers: that, whilst he was inveighing against everyone who would  not let Greece co-operate with them, they had not yet even agreed as to  whether they desired her co-operation.    England regarded the communication as a merely preliminary and  preparatory step, and waited for a definite proposal after the King's  decision, when she would consult with her allies.  France and Russia  insisted on the impossibility of Greece limiting her participation to a  war against Turkey alone: to be an effective partner of the Entente,  Greece must be prepared to fight Austria and Germany also.  France added  that the question of the participation of Greece in the Dardanelles  enterprise could not be a useful subject of discussion between the Allies  until a definite decision by the Greek Government was taken.  Russia did  not even envisage the usefulness of such a discussion.  M. Sazonow  pointedly declared that he did not consider Greek co-operation in the  Dardanelles at all necessary, that the question of the Straits and of  Constantinople ought to be settled by the Entente Powers alone without  the intervention of third parties, and that Russia did not desire the  entry of a Greek army into Constantinople, though she had no objection to  its operating against Smyrna or elsewhere.[20]    {32}    Some days later, it is true, M. Delcasse affirmed that he had overcome  Russia's repugnance;[21] but, though it is probable that Russia, yielding  to pressure, would have accepted the participation of Greek troops, she  made no secret of her satisfaction at not having had to do so: \"We  heartily consent to your receiving large compensations in Asia Minor,\"  said the Russian Minister at Athens, in the presence of his British  colleague, to a high official of the Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  \"But as to Constantinople, we prefer that you should not come there; it  would afterwards be painful for you and disagreeable for everybody to  turn you out.\" [22]    M. Venizelos knew these views perfectly well, and did not covet  Constantinople: what he coveted, so far as material gains went, were the  large compensations in Asia Minor.[23]  There lay the chief objective of  his strategy, and its net outcome was to widen the breach between him and  those elements in the country which still believed that the policy of  Greece must be governed by the solid necessities of the Balkan situation,  not by nebulous visions of Imperialist expansion.

[3] He explained, three years afterwards, that at the time of making his  offer of 18 Aug., 1914, he bore in mind \"the impossibility of going to  Servia's assistance on account of the danger from Bulgaria.\"--_Orations_,  p. 93.  But precisely similar was the objection to going against Turkey  without a guarantee of Bulgarian neutrality: only the Bulgars, in the one  case, would have been on Greece's left flank and in the other on the  right.  The truth seems to be that the vision of M. Venizelos lacked the  penetration which, in matters of this sort, can only come from long study  and reflection.
