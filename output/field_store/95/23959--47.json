[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2232"],[0,"The Duchess of Malfi (#8)"],[1,"   Do not speak.      DUCHESS.  No, sir:    I will plant my soul in mine ears, to hear you.      FERDINAND.  O most imperfect light of human reason,    That mak'st [us] so unhappy to foresee    What we can least prevent!  Pursue thy wishes,    And glory in them:  there 's in shame no comfort    But to be past all bounds and sense of shame.      DUCHESS.  I pray, sir, hear me:  I am married.      FERDINAND.                                      So!      DUCHESS.  Happily, not to your liking:  but for that,    Alas, your shears do come untimely now    To clip the bird's wings that 's already flown!    Will you see my husband?      FERDINAND.                Yes, if I could change    Eyes with a basilisk.      DUCHESS.               Sure, you came hither    By his confederacy.      FERDINAND.           The howling of a wolf    Is music to thee, screech-owl:  prithee, peace.--    Whate'er thou art that hast enjoy'd my sister,    For I am sure thou hear'st me, for thine own sake    Let me not know thee.  I came hither prepar'd    To work thy discovery; yet am now persuaded    It would beget such violent effects    As would damn us both.  I would not for ten millions    I had beheld thee:  therefore use all means    I never may have knowledge of thy name;    Enjoy thy lust still, and a wretched life,    On that condition.--And for thee, vile woman,    If thou do wish thy lecher may grow old    In thy embracements, I would have thee build    Such a room for him as our anchorites    To holier use inhabit.  Let not the sun    Shine on him till he 's dead; let dogs and monkeys    Only converse with him, and such dumb things    To whom nature denies use to sound his name;    Do not keep a paraquito, lest she learn it;    If thou do love him, cut out thine own tongue,    Lest it bewray him.      DUCHESS.             Why might not I marry?    I have not gone about in this to create    Any new world or custom.      FERDINAND.                Thou art undone;    And thou hast ta'en that massy sheet of lead    That hid thy husband's bones, and folded it    About my heart.      DUCHESS.         Mine bleeds for 't.      FERDINAND.                            Thine! thy heart!    What should I name 't unless a hollow bullet    Fill'd with unquenchable wild-fire?      DUCHESS.                             You are in this    Too strict; and were you not my princely brother,    I would say, too wilful:  my reputation    Is safe.      FERDINAND.  Dost thou know what reputation is?    I 'll tell thee,--to small purpose, since the instruction    Comes now too late.    Upon a time Reputation, Love, and Death,    Would travel o'er the world; and it was concluded    That they should part, and take three several ways.    Death told them, they should find him in great battles,    Or cities plagu'd with plagues:  Love gives them counsel    To inquire for him 'mongst unambitious shepherds,    Where dowries were not talk'd of, and sometimes    'Mongst quiet kindred that had nothing left    By their dead parents:  'Stay,' quoth Reputation,    'Do not forsake me; for it is my nature,    If once I part from any man I meet,    I am never found again.' And so for you:    You have shook hands with Reputation,    And made him invisible.  So, fare you well:    I will never see you more.      DUCHESS.                    Why should only I,    Of all the other princes of the world,    Be cas'd up, like a holy relic?  I have youth    And a little beauty.      FERDINAND.            So you have some virgins    That are witches.  I will never see thee more.         Exit.           Re-enter ANTONIO with a pistol, [and CARIOLA]      DUCHESS.  You saw this apparition?      ANTONIO.                            Yes:  we are    Betray'd.  How came he hither?  I should turn    This to thee, for that.      CARIOLA.                 Pray, sir, do; and when    That you have cleft my heart, you shall read there    Mine innocence.      DUCHESS.         That gallery gave him entrance.      ANTONIO.  I would this terrible thing would come again,    That, standing on my guard, I might relate    My warrantable love.--         (She shows the poniard.)                            Ha! what means this?      DUCHESS.  He left this with me.      ANTONIO.                         And it seems did wish    You would use it on yourself.      DUCHESS.                       His action seem'd    To intend so much.      ANTONIO.            This hath a handle to 't,    As well as a point:  turn it towards him, and    So fasten the keen edge in his rank gall.         [Knocking within.]    How now! who knocks?  More earthquakes?      DUCHESS.                                 I stand    As if a mine beneath my feet were ready    To be blown up.      CARIOLA.         'Tis Bosola.      DUCHESS.                       Away!    O misery! methinks unjust actions    Should wear these masks and curtains, and not we.    You must instantly part hence:  I have fashion'd it already.         Exit ANTONIO.           Enter BOSOLA      BOSOLA.  The duke your brother is ta'en up in a whirlwind;    Hath took horse, and 's rid post to Rome.      DUCHESS.                                   So late?      BOSOLA.  He told me, as he mounted into the saddle,    You were undone.      DUCHESS.          Indeed, I am very near it.      BOSOLA.  What 's the matter?      DUCHESS.  Antonio, the master of our household,    Hath dealt so falsely with me in 's accounts.    My brother stood engag'd with me for money    Ta'en up of certain Neapolitan Jews,    And Antonio lets the bonds be forfeit.      BOSOLA.  Strange!--[Aside.] This is cunning.      DUCHESS.  And hereupon    My brother's bills at Naples are protested    Against.--Call up our officers.      BOSOLA.                          I shall.         Exit.           [Re-enter ANTONIO]      DUCHESS.  The place that you must fly to is Ancona:    Hire a house there; I 'll send after you    My treasure and my jewels.  Our weak safety    Runs upon enginous wheels:[82] short syllables    Must stand for periods.  I must now accuse you    Of such a feigned crime as Tasso calls    Magnanima menzogna, a noble lie,    'Cause it must shield our honours.--Hark! they are coming.           [Re-enter BOSOLA and Officers]      ANTONIO.  Will your grace hear me?      DUCHESS.  I have got well by you; you have yielded me    A million of loss:  I am like to inherit    The people's curses for your stewardship.    You had the trick in audit-time to be sick,    Till I had sign'd your quietus;[83] and that cur'd you    Without help of a doctor.--Gentlemen,    I would have this man be an example to you all;    So shall you hold my favour; I pray, let him;    For h'as done that, alas, you would not think of,    And, because I intend to be rid of him,    I mean not to publish.--Use your fortune elsewhere.      ANTONIO.  I am strongly arm'd to brook my overthrow,    As commonly men bear with a hard year.    I will not blame the cause on 't; but do think    The necessity of my malevolent star    Procures this, not her humour.  O, the inconstant    And rotten ground of service!  You may see,    'Tis even like him, that in a winter night,    Takes a long slumber o'er a dying fire,    A-loth to part from 't; yet parts thence as cold    As when he first sat down.      DUCHESS.                    We do confiscate,    Towards the satisfying of your accounts,    All that you have.      ANTONIO.            I am all yours; and 'tis very fit    All mine should be so.      DUCHESS.                So, sir, you have your pass.      ANTONIO.  You may see, gentlemen, what 'tis to serve    A prince with body and soul.         Exit.      BOSOLA.  Here 's an example for extortion:  what moisture is drawn    out of the sea, when foul weather comes, pours down, and runs into    the sea again.      DUCHESS.  I would know what are your opinions    Of this Antonio.      SECOND OFFICER.  He could not abide to see a pig's head gaping:    I thought your grace would find him a Jew.      THIRD OFFICER.  I would you had been his officer, for your own sake.      FOURTH OFFICER.  You would have had more money.      FIRST OFFICER.  He stopped his ears with black wool, and to those came    to him for money said he was thick of hearing.      SECOND OFFICER.  Some said he was an hermaphrodite, for he could not    abide a woman.      FOURTH OFFICER.  How scurvy proud he would look when the treasury    was full!  Well, let him go.      FIRST OFFICER.  Yes, and the chippings of the buttery fly after him,    to scour his gold chain.[84]      DUCHESS.  Leave us.         Exeunt [Officers.]    What do you think of these?      BOSOLA.  That these are rogues that in 's prosperity,    But to have waited on his fortune, could have wish'd    His dirty stirrup riveted through their noses,    And follow'd after 's mule, like a bear in a ring;    Would have prostituted their daughters to his lust;    Made their first-born intelligencers;[85] thought none happy    But such as were born under his blest planet,    And wore his livery:  and do these lice drop off now?    Well, never look to have the like again:    He hath left a sort[86] of flattering rogues behind him;    Their doom must follow.  Princes pay flatterers    In their own money:  flatterers dissemble their vices,    And they dissemble their lies; that 's justice.    Alas, poor gentleman!      DUCHESS.  Poor! he hath amply fill'd his coffers.      BOSOLA.  Sure, he was too honest.  Pluto,[87] the god of riches,    When he 's sent by Jupiter to any man,    He goes limping, to signify that wealth    That comes on God's name comes slowly; but when he's sent    On the devil's errand, he rides post and comes in by scuttles.[88]    Let me show you what a most unvalu'd jewel    You have in a wanton humour thrown away,    To bless the man shall find him.  He was an excellent    Courtier and most faithful; a soldier that thought it    As beastly to know his own value too little    As devilish
