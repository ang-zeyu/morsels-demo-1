Leboeuf.          [2] \"All the illustrious persons of the country.\" Louis        Bonaparte's _Appeal to the people_. December 2, 1851.          [3] \"The Senate was an abortion; and in France no one likes to        see people well paid merely for making some bad selections.\"        Words of Napoleon, _Memorial from St. Helena_.    \"What is your position in the country?\" some one asks the Senate. \"We  are charged with the preservation of public liberty.\"--\"What is your  business in this city?\" Pierrot demands of Harlequin.--\"My business,\"  replies Harlequin, \"is to curry-comb the bronze horse.\"    \"We know what is meant by _esprit-de-corps_: this spirit will urge the  Senate by every possible means to augment its power. It will destroy  the Corps Legislatif, if it can; and if occasion offers it will  compound with the Bourbons.\"    Who said this? The First Consul. Where? At the Tuileries, in April,  1804.    \"Without title or authority, and in violation of every principle, it  has surrendered the country and consummated its ruin. It has been the  plaything of eminent intriguers; I know of no body which ought to  appear in history with greater ignominy than the Senate.\"    Who said this? The Emperor. Where? At St. Helena.    There is actually then a senate in the \"Constitution of January 14.\"  But, candidly speaking, this is a mistake; for now that public hygiene  has made some progress, we are accustomed to see the public highway  better kept. After the Senate of the Empire, we thought that no more  senates would be mixed up with Constitutions.          III    THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND THE CORPS LEGISLATIF      There is also a Council of State and a Corps Legislatif: the former  joyous, well paid, plump, rosy, fat, and fresh, with a sharp eye, a red  ear, a voluble tongue, a sword by its side, a belly, and embroidered in  gold; the Corps Legislatif, pale, meagre, sad, and embroidered in  silver. The Council of State comes and goes, enters and exits, returns,  rules, disposes, decides, settles, and decrees, and sees Louis Napoleon  face to face. The Corps Legislatif, on the contrary, walks on tiptoe,  fumbles with its hat, puts its finger to its lips, smiles humbly, sits  on the corner of its chair, and speaks only when questioned. Its words  being naturally obscene, the public journals are forbidden to make the  slightest allusion to them. The Corps Legislatif passes laws and votes  taxes by Article 39; and when, fancying it has occasion for some  instruction, some detail, some figures, or some explanation, it  presents itself, hat in hand, at the door of the departments to consult  the ministers, the usher receives it in the antechamber, and with a  roar of laughter, gives it a fillip on the nose. Such are the duties of  the Corps Legislatif.    Let us state, however, that this melancholy position began, in June,  1852, to extort some sighs from the sorrowful personages who form a  portion of the concern. The report of the commission on the budget will  remain in the memory of men, as one of the most heart-rending  masterpieces of the plaintive style. Let us repeat those gentle  accents:--    \"Formerly, as you know, the necessary communications in such cases were  carried on directly between the commissioners and the ministers. It was  to the latter that they addressed themselves to obtain the documents  indispensable to the discussion of affairs; and the ministers even came  personally, with the heads of their several departments, to give verbal  explanations, frequently sufficient to preclude the necessity of  further discussion; and the resolutions formed by the commission on the  budget after they had heard them, were submitted direct to the Chamber.    \"But now we can have no communication with the government except  through the medium of the Council of State, which, being the confidant  and the organ of its own ideas, has alone the right of transmitting to  the Corps Legislatif the documents which, in its turn, it receives from  the ministers.    \"In a word, for written reports, as well as for verbal communications,  the government commissioners have superseded the ministers, with whom,  however, they must have a preliminary understanding.    \"With respect to the modifications which the commission might wish to  propose, whether by the adoption of amendments presented by the  deputies, or from its own examination of the budget, they must, before  you are called upon to consider them, be sent to the Council of State,  there to undergo discussion.    \"There (it is impossible not to notice it) those modifications have no  interpreters, no official defenders.    \"This mode of procedure appears to be derived from the Constitution  itself; and _if we speak of the matter now_, it is _solely_ to prove to  you that it must occasion _delays_ in accomplishing the task imposed  upon the commission on the budget.\"[1]          [1] Report of the commission on the budget of the Corps        Legislatif, June, 1852.    Reproach was never so mildly uttered; it is impossible to receive more  chastely and more gracefully, what M. Bonaparte, in his autocratic  style, calls \"guarantees of calmness,\"[2] but what Moliere, with the  license of a great writer, denominates \"kicks.\"[3]          [2] Preamble of the Constitution.          [3] See _Les Fourberies de Scapin_.    Thus, in the shop where laws and budgets are manufactured, there is a  master of the house, the Council of State, and a servant, the Corps  Legislatif. According to the terms of the \"Constitution,\" who is it  that appoints the master of the house? M. Bonaparte. Who appoints the  servant? The nation. That is as it should be.          IV    THE FINANCES      Let it be observed that, under the shadow of these \"wise institutions,\"  and thanks to the _coup d'etat_, which, as is well known, has  re-established order, the finances, the public safety, and public  prosperity, the budget, by the admission of M. Gouin, shows a deficit  of 123,000,000 francs.    As for commercial activity since the _coup d'etat_, as for the  prosperity of trade, as for the revival of business, in order to  appreciate them it is enough to reject words and have recourse to  figures. On this point, the following statement is official and  decisive: the discounts of the Bank of France produced during the first  half of 1852, only 589,502fr. 62c. at the central bank; while the  profits of the branch establishments have risen only to 651,108fr. 7c.  This appears from the half-yearly report of the Bank itself.    M. Bonaparte, however, does not trouble himself with taxation. Some  fine morning he wakes and yawns, rubs his eyes, takes his pen and  decrees--what? The budget. Achmet III. was once desirous of levying  taxes according to his own fancy.--\"Invincible lord,\" said his Vizier  to him, \"your subjects cannot be taxed beyond what is prescribed by the  law and the prophet.\"    This identical M. Bonaparte, when at Ham, wrote as follows:--        \"If the sums levied each year on the inhabitants generally are      employed for unproductive purposes, such as creating _useless      places, raising sterile monuments, and maintaining in the midst of      profound peace a more expensive army than that which conquered at      Austerlitz_, taxation becomes in such case an overwhelming burden;      it exhausts the country, it takes without any return.\"[1]          [1] _Extinction of Pauperism_, page 10.    With reference to this word budget an observation occurs to us. In  this present year 1852, the bishops and the judges of the _Cour de  Cassation_,[2] have 50 francs per diem; the archbishops, the  councillors of state, the first presidents, and the procureurs-general,  have each 69 francs per diem; the senators, the prefects, and the  generals of division receive 83 francs each per diem; the presidents of  sections of the Council of State 222 francs per diem; the ministers 252  francs per diem; Monseigneur the Prince-President, comprising of  course, in his salary, the sum for maintenance of the royal residences,  receives per diem 44,444 francs, 44 centimes. The revolution of the 2nd  of December was made against the Twenty-five Francs!          [2] Court of Appeal.          V    THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS      We have now seen what the legislature is, what the administration, and  what the budget.    And the courts! What was formerly called the _Cour de Cassation_ is no  longer anything more than a record office of councils of war. A soldier  steps out of the guard-house and writes in the margin of the book of  the law, _I will_, or _I will not_. In all directions the corporal  gives the order, and the magistrate countersigns it. Come! tuck up your  gowns and begone, or else--Hence these abominable trials, sentences,  and condemnations. What a sorry spectacle is that troop of judges, with  hanging heads and bent backs, driven with the butt end of the musket  into baseness and iniquity!    And the liberty of the press! What shall we say of it? Is it not a  mockery merely to pronounce the words? That free press, the honour of  French intellect, a light thrown from all points at once upon all  questions, the perpetual sentinel of the nation--where is it? What has  M. Bonaparte done with it? It is where the public platform is. Twenty  newspapers extinguished in Paris, eighty in the departments,--one  hundred newspapers suppressed: that is to say, looking only to the  material side of the question, innumerable families deprived of bread;  that is to say, understand it, citizens, one hundred houses  confiscated, one hundred farms taken from their proprietors, one  hundred interest coupons stolen from the public funds. Marvellous  identity of principles: freedom suppressed is property destroyed.

During      (p. 011)  floor debate on the Selective Service Act, Senator Robert F. Wagner of  New York proposed an amendment to guarantee to Negroes and other  racial minorities the privilege of voluntary enlistment in the armed  forces. He sought in this fashion to correct evils described some ten  days earlier by Rayford W. Logan, chairman of the Committee for Negro  Participation in the National Defense, in testimony before the House  Committee on Military Affairs. The Wagner proposal triggered critical  comments and questions. Senators John H. Overton and Allen J. Ellender  of Louisiana viewed the Wagner amendment as a step toward \"mixed\"  units. Overton, Ellender, and Senator Lister Hill of Alabama proposed  that the matter should be \"left to the Army.\" Hill also attacked the  amendment because it would allow the enlistment of Japanese-Americans,  some of whom he claimed were not loyal to the United States.[1-24]                       [Footnote 1-24: _Congressional Record_, 76th Cong.,                     3d sess., vol. 86, p. 10890.]    [Illustration: GENERAL PERSHING, AEF COMMANDER, INSPECTS TROOPS _of  the 802d (Colored) Pioneer Regiment in France, 1918_.]    No filibuster was attempted, and the Wagner amendment passed the  Senate easily, 53 to 21. It provided         that any person between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five       regardless of race or color shall be afforded an opportunity       voluntarily to enlist and be inducted into the land and naval       forces (including aviation units) of the United States for the       training and service prescribed in subsection (b), if he is       acceptable to the land or naval forces for such training and       service.[1-25]                       [Footnote 1-25: 54 _U.S. Stat._ 885(1940).]    The Wagner amendment was aimed at _volunteers_ for military service.  Congressman Hamilton Fish, also of New York, later introduced a  similar measure in the House aimed at _draftees_. The Fish         (p. 012)  amendment passed the House by a margin of 121 to 99 and emerged intact  from the House-Senate conference. The law finally read that in the  selection and training of men and execution of the law \"there shall be  no discrimination against any person on account of race or color.\"[1-26]                       [Footnote 1-26: Ibid. Fish commanded black troops in                     World War I. Captain of Company K, Fifteenth New                     York National Guard (Colored), which subsequently                     became the 369th Infantry, Fish served in the much                     decorated 93d Division in the French sector of the                     Western Front.]    [Illustration: HEROES OF THE 369TH INFANTRY. _Winners of the Croix de  Guerre arrive in New York Harbor, February 1919._]    The Fish amendment had little immediate impact upon the services'  racial patterns. As long as official policy permitted separate draft  calls for blacks and whites and the officially held definition of  discrimination neatly excluded segregation--and both went unchallenged  in the courts--segregation would remain entrenched in the armed  forces. Indeed, the rigidly segregated services, their ranks swollen  by the draft, were a particular frustration to the civil rights forces  because they were introducing some black citizens to racial  discrimination more pervasive than any they had ever endured in  civilian life. Moreover, as the services continued to open bases  throughout the country, they actually spread federally sponsored  segregation into areas where it had never before existed with the  force of law. In the long run, however, the 1940 draft law and  subsequent draft legislation had a strong influence on the armed  forces' racial policies. They created a climate in which progress  could be made toward integration within the services. Although not  apparent in 1940, the pressure of a draft-induced flood of black   (p. 013)  conscripts was to be a principal factor in the separate decisions of  the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to integrate their units.      _To Segregate Is To Discriminate_    As with all the administration's prewar efforts to increase  opportunities for Negroes in the armed forces, the Selective Service  Act failed to excite black enthusiasm because it missed the point of  black demands. Guarantees of black participation were no longer  enough. By 1940 most responsible black leaders shared the goal of an  integrated armed forces as a step toward full participation in the  benefits and responsibilities of American citizenship.    The White House may well have thought that Walter White of the NAACP  singlehandedly organized the demand for integration in 1939, but he  was merely applying a concept of race relations that had been evolving  since World War I. In the face of ever-worsening discrimination,  White's generation of civil rights advocates had rejected the idea of  the preeminent black leader Booker T. Washington that hope for the  future lay in the development of a separate and strong black       (p. 014)  community. Instead, they gradually came to accept the argument of one  of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of  Colored People, William E. B. DuBois, that progress was possible only  when Negroes abandoned their segregated community to work toward a  society open to both black and white. By the end of the 1930's this  concept had produced a fundamental change in civil rights tactics and  created the new mood of assertiveness that Myrdal found in the black  community. The work of White and others marked the beginning of a  systematic attack against Jim Crow. As the most obvious practitioner  of Jim Crow in the federal government, the services were the logical  target for the first battle in a conflict that would last some thirty  years.    This evolution in black attitudes was clearly demonstrated in  correspondence in the 1930's between officials of the NAACP and the  Roosevelt administration over equal treatment in the armed forces. The  discussion began in 1934 with a series of exchanges between Chief of  Staff Douglas MacArthur and NAACP Counsel Charles H. Houston and  continued through the correspondence between White and the  administration in 1937. The NAACP representatives rejected MacArthur's  defense of Army policy and held out for a quota guaranteeing that  Negroes would form at least 10 percent of the nation's military  strength. Their emphasis throughout was on numbers; during these first  exchanges, at least, they fought against disbandment of the existing  black regiments and argued for similar units throughout the  service.[1-27]                       [Footnote 1-27: See especially Ltr, Houston to CofS,                     1 Aug and 29 Aug 34; Ltr, CofS to Houston, 20 Aug                     34; Ltr, Maj Gen Edgar T.

All in                     C-376, NAACP Collection, Library of Congress.]    Yet the idea of integration was already strongly implied in Houston's  1934 call for \"a more united nation of free citizens,\"[1-28] and in  February 1937 the organization emphasized the idea in an editorial in  _The Crisis_, asking why black and white men could not fight side by  side as they had in the Continental Army.[1-29] And when the Army  informed the NAACP in September 1939 that more black units were  projected for mobilization, White found this solution unsatisfactory  because the proposed units would be segregated.[1-30] If democracy was  to be defended, he told the President, discrimination must be  eliminated from the armed forces. To this end, the NAACP urged  Roosevelt to appoint a commission of black and white citizens to  investigate discrimination in the Army and Navy and to recommend the  removal of racial barriers.[1-31]                       [Footnote 1-28: Ibid.

This letter was                     later released to the press.]    The White House ignored these demands, and on 17 October the secretary  to the President, Col. Edwin M. Watson, referred White to a War  Department report outlining the new black units being created under  presidential authorization. But the NAACP leaders were not to be  diverted from the main chance. Thurgood Marshall, then the head of (p. 015)  the organization's legal department, recommended that White tell the  President \"that the NAACP is opposed to the separate units existing in  the armed forces at the present time.\"[1-32]                       [Footnote 1-32: Memo, Marshall for White, 28 Oct 39;                     Ltr, Secy to the President to White, 17 Oct 39.
