A great number of branching and straight looped,  tubuli (little tubes) converge on an open space, the pelvis. Towards  the outer layers (cortex) of the kidney, these tubuli terminate in little  dilatations into which tangled knots of blood-vessels project: the  dilatations are called Bowman's capsules (B.c.), and each coil of  bloodvessel a glomerulus (gl.). In the capsules, water is drained from  the blood; in the tubuli, urea and other salts in the urine are secreted  from a branching network of vessels.      Section 63. In all the epithelial tissues that we have considered we  have one feature in common: they are cells, each equivalent to the  amoeba, that have taken on special duties-- in a word, they are  specialists. The amoeba is Jack of all trades and a free lance; the  protective epidermal cell, the current-making ciliated cell, the bile or  urea-making secretory cell, is master of one trade, and a soldier in a  vast and wonderfully organized host. We will now consider our second  kind of cell in this organization, the cell of which the especial aim is  the building round it of a tissue.      Section 64. The simplest variety in this group is hyaline (i.e. glassy)  cartilage (gristle). In this the formative cells (the cartilage  corpuscles) are enjellied in a clear structureless matrix (Figure XII.),  consisting entirely of organic compounds accumulated by their  activity. Immediately round the cell lies a capsule of newer material.  Some of the cells have recently divided (1); others have done so less  recently, and there has been time for the interpolation of matrix, as  at 2. In this way the tissue grows and is repaired. A thin layer of  connective tissue (see below), the perichondrium, clothes the  cartilaginous structure.      Section 65. Connective tissue (Figure XIII) is a general name for a  group of tissues of very variable character. It is usually described as  consisting typically in the mammals of three chief elements felted  together; of comparatively unmodified corpuscles (c.c.), more or less  amoeboid, and of fibres which are elongated, altered, and distorted  cells. The fibres are of two kinds: yellow, branching, and highly elastic  (y.e.f.), in consequence of which they fall into sinuous lines  in a preparation, and white and inelastic ones (w.i.f.), lying in parallel  bundles. Where the latter element is entirely dominant, the connective  tissue is tendon, found especially at the point of attachment of  muscles to the parts they work. Some elastic ligaments are almost  purely yellow fibrous tissue. A loose interweaving of the three  elements is areolar tissue, the chief fabric of mesentery, membrane,  and the dermis (beneath the epidermis). With muscle it is the material  of the walls of the alimentary canal and bloodvessels, and generally it  enters into, binds together, and holds in place other tissue. The  connective tissue of fishes displays the differentiation of fibres in a far  less distinct manner.      Section 66. Through connective tissues wander the phagocytes,  cells that are difficult to distinguish, if really distinct, from the white  blood corpuscles. These cells possess a remarkable freedom; they  show an initiative of their own, and seem endowed with a  subordinate individuality. They occur in great numbers in a tissue  called, botryoidal tissue (Figure XIV.), which occurs especially in  masses and patches along the course of the alimentary canal, in its  walls. The tonsils, swellings on either side of the throat, are such  masses, and aggregates occur as visible patches, the Peyer's  patches, on the ileum. It also constitutes the mass of the vermiform  appendix and the wall of the sacculus rotundus; and in the young  animal the \"thymus gland,\" ventral to the heart, and less entirely, the  \"thyroid gland,\" ventral to the larynx, are similar structures, which  are reduced or disappear as development proceeds. It is evident that  in these two latter cases the term \"gland\" is somewhat of a  misnomer. The matrix of botryoidal tissue is a network of stretched  and hollowed connective tissue cells-- it is not a secretion, as  cartilage matrix appears to be. During digestion, the phagocytes prowl  into the intestine, and ingest and devour bacteria, that might  otherwise give rise to disease. In inflammation, we may note here,  they converge from all directions upon the point wounded or irritated.  They appear to be the active agents in all processes of absorption  (see osteoclasts under bone), and for instance, migrate into and  devour the tissue of the tadpole's tail, during its metamorphosis to the  adult frog.      Section 67. Within the connective tissue cells fat drops may be  formed, as in Figure XV. Adipose tissue is simply connective tissue  loaded with fat-distended cells. The tissue is, of course, a store form  of hydro-carbon (Section 17) provided against the possible  misadventure of starvation. With the exception of some hybernating  animals, such store forms would seem to be of accidental importance  only among animals, whereas among plants they are of invariable and  necessary occurrence.      Section 68. We now come to Bone, a tissue confined to the  vertebrata, and typically shown only in the higher types. As we  descend in the scale from birds and mammals to lizards, amphibia  (frogs and toads) and fish, we find cartilage continually more  important, and the bony constituent of the skeleton correspondingly  less so. In such a type as the dog-fish, the skeleton is entirely  cartilaginous, bone only occurs in connection with the animal's  scales; it must have been in connection with scales that bone first  appeared in the vertebrate sub-kingdom. In the frog we have a  cartilaginous skeleton overlaid by numerous bony scutes (shield-like  plates) which, when the student comes to study that type, he will  perceive are equivalent to the bony parts of such scales as occur in  the dog-fish, sunk inward, and plating over the cartilage; and in the  frog the cartilage also is itself, in a few places, replaced by bony  tissue. In the adult rabbit these two kinds of bone, the bone overlying  what was originally cartilage (membrane bone), and the bone  replacing the cartilage (cartilage bone) have, between them,  practically superseded the cartilage altogether. The structure of the  most characteristic kind of bone will be understood by reference to  Figure XVI. It is a simplified diagram of the transverse section of  such a bone as the thigh bone. M.C. is the central marrow cavity,  H.v., H.v. are cross sections of small bloodvessels, the Haversian  vessels running more or less longitudinally through, the bone in  canals, the Haversian canals. Arranged round these vessels are  circles of the formative elements, the bone corpuscles or  osteoblasts (b.c.) each embedded in bony matrix in a little bed, the  lacuna, and communicating one with another by fine processes  through canaliculi in the matrix, which processes are only to be  seen clearly in decalcified bone (See Section 70). The osteoblasts are  arranged in concentric series, and the matrix is therefore in concentric  layers, or lamellae (c.l.). Without and within the zone of Haversian  systems are (o.l. and i.l.), the outer and inner lamellae. The bone is  surrounded by connective tissue, the periosteum. In addition to this  compact bone, there is a lighter and looser variety in which spicules  and bars of bony tissue are loosely interwoven. Many flat bones, the  bones of the skull, for instance, consist of this spongy bone, plated  (as an electro spoon is plated) with compact bone.      Section 69. Among the bony bars and spicules of spongy bone  occurs the red marrow-- which must not be confused with the yellow  marrow, the fatty substance in the central cavity of long bones. In this  red marrow are numerous large colourless cells, which appear  to form within their substance and then liberate red blood corpuscles.  This occurs especially in the spongy bone within the ribs.      Section 70. The matrix of bone differs from that of cartilage or of  most other tissues in consisting chiefly of inorganic salts. The chief of  these is calcium phosphate, with which much smaller quantities  of calcium carbonate, and magnesium phosphate and carbonate  occur. These inorganic salts can be removed by immersion of the  bone in weak hydrochloric acid, and a flexible network of connecting  tissue, Haversian vessels, bone corpuscles, and their processes  remains. This is decalcified bone alluded to above.      Section 71. In the very young rabbit, the limb bones, vertebral column,  and many of the skull bones are simply plates and bars of cartilage;  the future membrane bones, however are planned out in connective  tissue. The development of the latter is simple, the connective  tissue corpuscles functioning by a simple change of product as  osteoblast. The development of the cartilage bones, however, is more  complicated. Figure XVII., represents, in a diagrammatic way, the  stages in the conversion of a cartilaginous bar to bone. To begin with,  the previously sporadically-arranged (scattered anyhow) corpuscles  (u.c.c.) are gathered into groups in single file, or in other words, into  \"columnar\" groups (as at c.c.). The matrix becomes clouded with  inorganic salts of lime, and it is then said to be calcified. This  calcified cartilage then undergoes absorption-- it must not be  imagined for a moment that bone is calcified cartilage. Simultaneous  with the formation of the cavities (s.) due to this absorption,  connective tissue (p.c.i.) from the surrounding perichondrium (p.c.)  grows into the ossifying* bar. It is from this connective tissue that the  osteoblasts (o.b.) arise, and bone is built up. Throughout life a bone is  continually being absorbed and reformed by the activity of the  osteoblasts. An osteoblast engaged in the absorption instead of the  formation of bone is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21783"],[0,"A Manual of Pronunciation (#8)"],[1,"           | * ||   |   |   |   ||
