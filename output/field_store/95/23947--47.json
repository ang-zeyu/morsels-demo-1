The repression of conscious or  unconscious feelings can no doubt change the whole mental life. We  should have the greatest respect for the men who are doing this work. It  requires, I am told, an almost unbelievable amount of patience and time  to accomplish the analysis. No doubt the adult judgment of childish  follies is a direct means of disposing of their harmful influence in  life, the surest way of losing the conscious or unconscious regrets that  sadden many lives. There are probably many cases of disturbed and  troubled mind that can be cured in this way only. The method does not  appeal to me because I am so strongly inclined to take people as they  are, to urge a forgetfulness that does not really forget, but which goes  on bravely to the development of life. This development cannot proceed  without the understanding that life may be made so beautiful that sins  and failures are lost in progress. Some of us may need the subtle  analysis of our lives to make clear the points where we went astray in  our thoughts and ideas, but many of us, fortunately, are able to take  ourselves for better or for worse, sins and all. Most of us ought to do  that, for the most part, if we are to progress and live. Sometimes the  revelations of evils we know not of result in complications rather than  simplification, as in the case of a boy who wrote to me and said that  since he had learned of his early sins he had made sure that he could  never be well. Instead of going into further analysis with him, I  assured him that, while it was undoubtedly his duty to regret all the  evil of his life, it was a still greater duty to go on and live the rest  of it well, and that he could do so if he would open his eyes to the  possibilities of unselfish service.    I am very much inclined to preach against self-analysis and the almost  inevitable regret and despair that accompany it.    One of my patients decided some time ago that her life was wasted, that  she had accomplished nothing. It was true that she had not the endurance  to meet the usual demands of social or even family life, and that for  long periods she had to give up altogether. But it happened that she had  the gift of musical understanding, that she had studied hard in younger  days. With a little urging the gift was made to grow again and to serve  not only the patient's own needs, but to bring very great pleasure to  every one who listened to her playing. That rare, true ability was worth  everything, and she came to realize it in time. The gift of musical  expression is a very great thing, and I succeeded in making this woman  understand that she should be happy in that ability even if nothing  else should be possible.    Often enough nothing that can compare with music exists, and life seems  wholly barren. Rather cold comfort it seems at first to assure a person  who is helpless that character is the greatest thing in the world, but  that is the final truth. The most limited and helpless life may glow  with it and be richer than imagination can believe. It is never time to  regret--and never time to despair. The less analysis the better. When it  comes to character, live, grow, and get a deeper and deeper  understanding of life--of life that is near to God and so capable of  wrong only as we turn away from Him. \"Do not say things; what you are  stands over you and thunders so, I cannot hear what you say to the  contrary.\" We shall do well not to forget that, whatever failures or  mistakes we have made, there is infinite possibility ahead of us, that  character is the greatest thing in the world, and that most good  character has been built upon mistakes and failures. I believe there is  no sin which may not make up the fabric of its own forgiveness in the  living of a free, self-sacrificing life. I know of no bodily ill nor  handicap which we may not eventually rise above and beyond by means of  brave spiritual progress. The body may fail us, but the spirit reaches  on and into the great world of God.          X    THE VIRTUES          The virtues hide their vanquished fires      Within that whiter flame--      Till conscience grows irrelevant      And duty but a name.                  FREDERICK LAWRENCE KNOWLES.    In most books I have read on \"nerves\" and similar subjects, advice is  given, encouragement is given, but the necessity for patience is not  made clear. Patience is typical of all the other virtues. Many a man has  followed the best of advice for a time, and has become discouraged  because the promised results did not materialize. It is disappointing,  surely, to have lived upon a diet for months only to find that you still  have dyspepsia, or to have followed certain rules of morality with great  precision and enthusiasm without obtaining the untroubled mind. We are  accustomed to see results in the material world and naturally expect  them everywhere. The trouble is we do not always recognize improvements  when we see them, and we insist upon certain preconceived changes as a  result of our endeavors. The physician is apt rashly to promise definite  physical accomplishments in a given time. He is courting disappointment  and distrust when he does so. We all want to get relief from our  symptoms, and we are inclined to insist upon a particular kind of relief  so strongly that we fail to appreciate the possibilities of another and  a better relief which may be at hand. The going astray in this  particular is sometimes very unfortunate. I have known a man to rush  frantically from one doctor to another, trying to obtain relief for a  particular pain or discomfort, unwilling to rest long enough to find out  that the trouble would have disappeared naturally if he had taken the  advice of the first physician, to live without impatience and within his  limitations.    The human body is a very complex organism, and sometimes pain and  distress are better not relieved, since they may be the expression of  some deeper maladjustment which must first be straightened out. This is  also true of the mind--in which the unhappy proddings of conscience had  better not be cured by anodynes or by evasion unless we are prepared to  go deeply enough to make them disappear spontaneously. We must sometimes  insist upon patience, though it should exist as a matter of  course--patience with ourselves and with others. The physician who  demands and secures the greatest degree of patience from his clients is  the most successful practitioner, for no life can go on successfully  without patience. If patience can be spontaneous,--the natural result of  a broadening outlook,--then it will be permanent and serviceable; the  other kind, that exists by extreme effort, may do for a while, but it is  a poor makeshift.    I always feel like apologizing when I ask a man or a woman to be  tolerant or charitable or generous or, for that matter, to practice any  of the ordinary virtues. Sound living should spring unbidden from the  very joy of life; it should need no justification and certainly no  urging. But unfortunately, as the world now stands, there are men and  groups of men who do not see the light. There is a wide contagion of  selfishness and short-sightedness among the well-to-do, and a necessary  federation of protection and selfishness among the poor. The practical  needs of life, artificial as they are among the rich, and terribly  insistent as they are among the poor, blind us to larger considerations.    If all matters of welfare, public or private, could be treated  unselfishly, how quickly we should be rid of some of the great evils  that afflict the race. I am inclined to think that much of the goodness  of people does come in that way, unconsciously, naturally, as the light  flows from the sun. Yet I suppose that in our present order, and until,  through the years, the better time arrives, we must very often ask  ourselves and others to be good and to be charitable, just because it is  right, or worse still because it is good policy.    A man grows better, more human, more intelligent, as he practices the  virtues. He is safer, no doubt, and the world is better. It is even true  that, by the constant practice of virtues, he may come finally to  espouse goodness and become thoroughly good. That is the hopeful thing  about it and the reason why we may consistently ask or demand the  routine practice of the virtues. But let us hold up all the time in our  teaching and in our lives the other course, the development of the  inspiration that includes all virtues and that makes all our way easy  and plain in a world where confusion reigns, because men are going at  the problem of right living the wrong way around.    The practice of good living will never be easy in its details, but if it  is sure in its inspiration there will be no question of the final  triumph. We shall have to fight blindly sometimes and with all the  strength and persistence of animals at bay. We shall fail sometimes,  too, and that is not always the worst thing that can happen. It is the  glory of life that we shall slowly triumph over ourselves and the world.  It is the glory of life that out of sore trouble, in the midst of  poverty and human injustice, may rise, spontaneous and serene, the  spirit of self-sacrifice, the unconquerable spirit of service that does  not question, that expresses the divine tenderness in terms of human  love. Through the times of darkness and doubt which must inevitably  come, there will be for those who cherish such a vision, and who come  back to it again and again, no utter darkness, no trouble that wholly  crushes, no loss that wholly destroys.    If we could not understand it before, it will slowly dawn upon us that  the life of Christ exemplified all these things. Charity, kindliness,  service, patience,--all these things which have seemed so hard will  become in our lives, as in his, the substance and expression of our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#8)"],[1,"rice on to boil  in plenty of cold water, stirring it from the bottom of the saucepan  occasionally while it is boiling fast; when the grains separate at the  ends, and thus appear to form the letter X, the rice will be done; it  requires about half an hour's gentle boiling. When the rice is done,  drain it in a colander, and place it before the fire, stirring it now  and then with a fork.      No. 93. RICE DUMPLINGS.    Boil one pound of rice as directed in the foregoing Number, and when  thoroughly drained free from excess of moisture, knead the rice with a  spoon in a basin into a smooth, compact kind of paste, and use this to  cover some peeled apples with in the same way as you would make an  ordinary apple dumpling. In order the better to enable you to handle the  rice-paste with ease, I recommend that each time previously to shaping  one of the dumplings, you should first dip your clean hands in cold  water. Let the dumplings, when finished, be tied up in small cloths, and  boiled in plenty of hot water for about three-quarters of an hour. The  cloths used for these dumplings must be greased.      No. 94. PLUM OR CURRANT DOUGH PUDDING.    Ingredients, two pounds of dough from the baker's, four ounces of plums  or currants, a pinch of allspice, ditto of salt, a gill of milk. Mix all  the above ingredients together in a pan; tie up the pudding in a  well-greased pudding-cloth, and place it in a pot containing _boiling_  water, and allow it to continue boiling for two hours; at the end of  this time the pudding will be done, and may be turned out on its dish.      No. 95. CHRISTMAS PLUM PUDDING.    Ingredients, two pounds of flour, twelve ounces of raisins, twelve  ounces of currants, twelve ounces of peeled and chopped apples, one  pound of chopped suet, twelve ounces of sugar, four eggs, one pint and  a-half of milk or beer, one ounce of salt, half an ounce of ground  allspice. Boil the pudding four hours. First, put the flour, suet, and  all the fruit in a large pan; mix these well together, and having made a  deep hole in the middle thereof with your fist, add the salt, sugar, and  allspice, and half a pint of the milk, or beer, to dissolve them; next,  add the four eggs, and the remaining pint of milk, or beer; mix all  vigorously together with the hand, tie up the pudding in a well-greased  and floured cloth, boil it for at least four hours, taking care that the  water boils before the pudding is put into the pot to boil. When done,  turn the pudding out on its dish, and, if you can afford it, pour over  it the following sauce:--      No. 96. SWEET PUDDING SAUCE.    Ingredients, two ounces of common flour, ditto of butter, ditto of  sugar, chopped lemon-peel, half a gill of any kind of spirits, and half  a pint of water. First mix the flour, butter, and sugar in a small  saucepan by kneading the ingredients well together with a wooden spoon,  then add the water, spirits, and lemon-peel; stir the sauce on the fire  till it comes to a boil, and then pour it all over the pudding.      No. 97. JAM PUDDING.    Ingredients, one pound of flour, six ounces of suet, half a pint of  water, a pinch of salt, one pound of any kind of common jam, at 7_d._  Mix the flour, suet, water, and salt into a firm, compact kind of paste;  roll this out with a rolling-pin, sprinkling some flour on the table to  prevent the paste from sticking to either; fold up the paste, and roll  it out again; repeat the rolling-out and folding three times; this  operation will make the paste lighter. Next, roll out the paste one foot  long by eighteen inches wide, spread the jam all over this, roll up the  pudding in the form of a bolster, roll it up in a well-greased and  floured cloth, tie it up tightly at both ends; put the pudding into a  pot of _boiling_ water, and boil it for nearly two hours; when done,  turn out carefully on to its dish, without breaking the crust.      No. 98. RHUBARB PIE.    A bundle of rhubarb, one pound of flour, six ounces of butter, or lard,  or dripping, half a pint of water, a pinch of salt, ditto of  baking-powder, eight ounces of moist sugar. First, cut up the rhubarb in  pieces about an inch long, wash them in plenty of water, and drain them  in a colander, or sieve. Next, place the flour in a pan, or on the  table, make a hollow in the middle with your fist, place the salt and  the baking-powder in it, pour in the water to dissolve them, then add  the butter; mix all together by working the ingredients with the fingers  of both hands, until the whole has become a firm, smooth, compact kind  of paste. You now put the cleaned rhubarb into a pie-dish, with the  sugar and a gill of water, roll out the paste to the exact size of the  dish, and after wetting the edges of the dish all round, place the  rolled-out paste upon it, and by pressing the thumb of the right hand  all round the upper part of the edge, the paste will be effectually  fastened on, so as to prevent the juice from running out at the sides; a  small hole the size of a sixpence must be made at the top of the pie,  for ventilation, or otherwise the pie would burst. Bake the pie for an  hour and a quarter.      No. 99. FRUIT PIES IN GENERAL.    All kinds of fruit pies are made as shown in the foregoing Number.      No. 100. A CHEAP KIND OF MINCE-MEAT.    Ingredients, eight ounces of stoned raisins, eight ounces of washed and  dried currants, one pound of tripe, one pound of apples, one pound of  chopped suet, four ounces of shred candied peel, one pound of moist  sugar, one ounce of allspice, the juice and the chopped rind of three  lemons, half a gill of rum. First chop the raisins, currants, apples,  and the tripe all together, or separately, until well mixed; then place  these in a pan, add the remainder of the ingredients, mix them  thoroughly until well incorporated with each other; put the mince-meat  into a clean dry stone jar, tie some thick paper, or a piece of bladder  over the top, and keep it in a cool place till wanted for use.      No. 101. MINCE-PIE PASTE.    Ingredients, one pound of flour, eight ounces of butter or lard, three  gills of water, half an ounce of salt, a tea-spoonful of baking-powder.  Place the flour on the table, hollow out a hole or well in the centre  with your fist, place the salt and baking-powder in this, add the water  and the butter, work all together lightly with the fingers, without  positively absorbing or entirely uniting the butter with the flour,  but, on the contrary, keeping the butter in distinct pieces here and  there; then roll up the paste in the form of a ball of dough, spread it  out on the floured table, and, with a rolling-pin, roll it out to the  extent of eighteen inches in length, by eight inches wide; then fold the  paste in three equal folds, roll it out the reverse way, fold it up  again as before, and after repeating the rolling out and folding up a  third time, the paste will be ready for use.      No. 102. TO MAKE A MINCE-PIE.    Having prepared the paste according to the directions given in the  foregoing Number, divide it in two equal parts, roll these out either  round or square, place one of the flats on a tin baking-dish, wet all  round the edge of the paste, spread some of the mince-meat about half an  inch thick all over the paste to within an inch of its edge, then cover  all in by laying the other flat of paste evenly upon the whole, press  all round the edge of the pie with your thumb to secure the mince-meat  from running out at the sides, score the pie neatly over the surface, in  the form of reversed strokes, and bake it for an hour.      No. 103. JAM TART.    Prepare some paste, as in No. 101, and use this to make a jam tart, as  directed for making a mince-pie, using any kind of common jam, instead  of mince-meat, for the purpose.      No. 104. BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS.    Ingredients, one pound of flour, four ounces of chopped suet, half a  pint of water, a pinch of salt, eight or ten large apples peeled. With  the above ingredients prepare some suet paste, as directed in No. 97;  divide the paste into about eight equal parts, first make these into  balls with the hand, and then roll them out with a rolling-pin to the  size of a large saucer, envelop an apple in each flat of paste, and,  wetting the edges with water, gather them round in a purse-like form,  and twist the ends tightly together to fasten them securely. The  dumplings, thus formed, must be placed on the twisted end, at equal  distances of three inches apart from each other, upon a tin baking-dish,  and baked in the oven for about three-quarters of an hour.      No. 105. PANCAKES FOR SHROVE TUESDAY.    Ingredients, twelve ounces of flour, three eggs, one pint of milk, a  tea-spoonful of salt, a little grated nutmeg, and chopped lemon-peel.  First, put the flour into a basin, hollow out the centre, add the salt,  nutmeg, lemon-peel, and a drop of milk, to dissolve them; then break in  the eggs, work all together, with a spoon, into a smooth soft paste, add  the remainder of the milk, and work the whole vigorously until it forms  a smooth liquid batter. Next, set a frying-pan on the fire, and, as soon  as it gets hot, wipe it out clean with a cloth, then run about a  tea-spoonful of lard all over the bottom of the hot frying-pan, pour in  half a small tea-cupful of the batter, place the pan over the fire, and,  in about a minute or so, the pancake will have become set sufficiently  firm to enable you to turn it over in the frying-pan, in order that it  may be baked on the other side also; the pancake done on both sides,  turn it out on its dish, and sprinkle a little sugar over it: proceed to  use up the remaining batter in the same manner.      No. 106. RAISINET--A PRESERVE FOR WINTER.
