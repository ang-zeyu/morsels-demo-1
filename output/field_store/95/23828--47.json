The       picture, as the painter said, was not far advanced, the Pharaoh       was merely in outline; my eye was, of course, attracted by the       finished figure, or rather what the painter had called the       finished figure; but, as I gazed upon it, it appeared to me       that there was something defective--something unsatisfactory in       the figure. I concluded, however, that the painter,       notwithstanding what he had said, had omitted to give it the       finishing touch. 'I intend this to be my best picture,' said       the painter; 'what I want now is a face for Pharaoh; I have       long been meditating on a face for Pharaoh.' Here, chancing to       cast his eye upon my countenance, of whom he had scarcely taken       any manner of notice, he remained with his mouth open for some       time, 'Who is this?' said he at last. 'Oh, this is my brother,       I forgot to introduce him----.'    We wish that the acquaintance had extended further, but this was not to  be. Borrow was soon to commence the wanderings which were to give him  much unsatisfactory fame, and the pair never met again. Let us, however,  return to John Borrow, who accompanied Haydon to Norwich, leaving his  brother for some time longer to the tender mercies of Sir Richard  Phillips. John, we judge, seems to have had plenty of shrewdness, and  was not without a sense of his own limitations. A chance came to him of  commercial success in a distant land, and he seized that chance. A  Norwich friend, Allday Kerrison, had gone out to Mexico, and writing  from Zacatecas in 1825 asked John to join him. John accepted. His salary  in the service of the Real del Monte Company was to be L300 per annum.  He sailed for Mexico in 1826, having obtained from his Colonel, Lord  Orford, leave of absence for a year, it being understood that renewals  of that leave of absence might be granted. He was entitled to half-pay  as a Lieutenant of the West Norfolk Militia, and this he settled upon  his mother during his absence. His career in Mexico was a failure. There  are many of his letters to his mother and brother extant which tell of  the difficulties of his situation. He was in three Mexican companies in  succession, and was about to be sent to Columbia to take charge of a  mine when he was stricken with a fever, and died at Guanajuato on 22nd  November 1838. He had far exceeded any leave that his Colonel could in  fairness grant, and before his death his name had been taken off the  army rolls. The question of his pay produced a long correspondence,  which can be found in the archives of the Rolls Office. I have the  original drafts of these letters in Borrow's handwriting. The first  letter by Borrow is dated 8th September 1831; it is better to give the  correspondence in its order.[20] The letters speak for themselves, and  require no comment.      I    To the Rt. Hon. The Secretary at War                    WILLOW LANE, NORWICH, _September 8, 1831._         SIR,--I take the liberty of troubling you with these lines for       the purpose of enquiring whether there is any objection to the       issuing of the disembodied allowance of my brother Lieut. John       Borrow of the Welsh Norfolk Militia, who is at present abroad.       I do this by the advice of the Army Pay Office, a power of       Attorney having been granted to me by Lieut. Borrow to receive       the said allowance for him. I beg leave to add that my brother       was present at the last training of his regiment, that he went       abroad with the leave of his Commanding Officer, which leave of       absence has never been recalled, that he has sent home the       necessary affidavits, and that there is no clause in the Pay       and Clothing Act to authorize the stoppage of his allowance. I       have the honor to remain, Sir, your most obedient, humble       servant,                    GEORGE BORROW.      II    To the Right Hon. The Secretary at War                    WILLOW LANE, NORWICH, _17th Septr. 1831._         SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of No. 33,063, dated       16th inst., from the War Office, in which I am informed that       the Office does not feel authorized to give instructions for       the issue of the arrears of disembodied allowance claimed by my       brother Lieut. Borrow of the West Norfolk, until he attend the       next training of his regiment, and I now beg leave to ask the       following question, and to request that I may receive an       answer with all convenient speed. What farther right to his       _present_ arrears of disembodied allowance will Lieut. Borrow's       appearance at the _next training_ of his regiment confer upon       him, and provided there is no authority at present for ordering       the payment of those arrears, by what authority will the War       Office issue instructions for the payment of the same, after       his arrival in this country and attendance at the training?       Sir, provided Lieut. Borrow is not entitled to his arrears of       disembodied allowance at the present moment, he will be       entitled to them at no future period, and I was to the last       degree surprised at the receipt of an answer which tends to       involve the office in an inextricable dilemma, for it is in       fact a full acknowledgment of the justice of Lieutenant       Borrow's claims, and a refusal to satisfy them until a certain       time, which instantly brings on the question, 'By what       authority does the War Office seek to detain the disembodied       allowance of an officer, to which he is entitled by Act of       Parliament, a moment after it has become due and is legally       demanded?' If it be objected that it is not legally demanded, I       reply that the affidavits filled up in the required form are in       the possession of the Pay Office, and also a power of Attorney       in the Spanish language, together with a Notarial translation,       which power of Attorney has been declared by the Solicitor of       the Treasury to be legal and sufficient. To that part of the       Official letter relating to my brother's appearance at the next       training I have to reply, that I believe he is at present lying       sick in the Mountains above Vera Cruz, the pest-house of the       New World, and that the last time I heard from him I was       informed that it would be certain death for him to descend into       the level country, even were he capable of the exertion, for       the fever was then raging there. Full six months have elapsed       since he prepared to return to his native country, having       received information that there was a probability that his       regiment would be embodied, (but) the hand of God overtook him       on his route. He is the son, Sir, of an Officer who served his       King abroad and at home for upwards of half a century; he had       intended his disembodied allowance for the use of his widowed       and infirm mother, but it must now be transmitted to him for       his own support until he can arrive in England. But, Sir, I do       not wish to excite compassion in his behalf, all I request is       that he may have justice done him, and if it be, I shall be       informed in the next letter, that the necessary order has been       given to the Pay Office for the issue of his arrears. I have       the honor to remain, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,                    GEORGE BORROW.      III    To the Right Hon. The Secretary at War                    NORWICH, _Novr. 24, 1831._         SIR,--Not having been favoured with an answer to the letter       which I last addressed to you concerning the arrears of       disembodied allowance due to Lieut. John Borrow of the West       Norfolk Militia, I again take the liberty of submitting this       matter to your consideration. More than six months have elapsed       since by virtue of a power of attorney granted to me by Lieut.       Borrow, I made demand at the army Pay Office for a portion of       those arrears, being the amount of two affidavits which were       produced, but owing to the much unnecessary demur which ensued,       chiefly with respect to the power of Attorney, since declared       to be valid, that demand has not hitherto been satisfied. I       therefore am compelled to beg that an order may be issued to       the Pay Office for the payment to me of the sums specified in       the said affidavits, that the amount may be remitted to Lieut.       Borrow, he being at present in great need thereof. If it be       answered that Lieut. Borrow was absent at the last training of       his regiment, and that he is not entitled to any arrears of       pay, I must beg leave to observe that the demand was legally       made many months previous to the said training, and cannot now       be set aside by his non-appearance, which arose from       unavoidable necessity; he having for the last year been lying       sick in one of the provinces of New Spain. And now, Sir, I will       make bold to inquire whether Lieut. Borrow, the son of an       Officer, who served his country abroad and at home, for upwards       of fifty years, is to lose his commission for being incapable,       from a natural visitation, of attending at the training; if it       be replied in the affirmative, I have only to add that his case       will be a cruelly hard one. But I hope and trust, Sir, that       taking all these circumstances into consideration you will not       _yet_ cause his name to be stricken off the list, and that you       will permit him to retain his commission in the event of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#8)"],[1,"the crew, and they  lay on their oars, and the wave with a roar burst right in front of the  boat, sending the spray of its crest high above our heads.    \"_Rema! rema forca!_\" (\"Row strongly!\") now shouted the patrao, speaking  Portuguese, as mostly all African coast natives do; and the crew gave  way. The next roller we had to meet in its strength; and save for the  steady force of the patrao's oar, I believe it would have tossed us  aside and we would have been swept under its curving wall of water. As  it was, the good boat gave a mighty bound as it felt its force, and its  stem pitched high into the air as it slid down its broad back into the  deep.    Another and yet another wave were passed, and we could now see them  breaking behind us, shutting out the beach from view. Then the last  roller was overcome, and there was nothing but the long heave of the  deep sea to contend against. Presently we arrived at the steamer, whose  side towered above us--an iron wall.    A shout came to me, pitching and lurching with the boat far below, \"Come  on board at once.\" But to come on board was only to be done by watching  a chance as the boat rose on the top of a roller. Taking such a one, I  seized the side-ropes, swung a moment in mid-air, and the next was on  the streamer's clean white deck. Before me stood a tall man with black  hair and whiskers and dark piercing eyes, who asked me if I was the  agent for Flint Brothers. I answered that the agent was on shore, and  that I was his assistant. Whereupon he informed me that he had been  appointed by the firm to liquidate all their stations and businesses on  the coast, and \"he would be obliged by my getting his luggage into the  boat.\" This was said in a peremptory sort of way, as if he had spoken to  a servant; and very much against the grain I obeyed his orders.    That the man was new to the coast was evident, and my consolation was  that he would be very soon sick of it and pretty well frightened before  he even got on shore, for the weather was freshening rapidly, a fact  of which he appeared to take no heed. Not so the boat-boys, who were  anxious to be off. At last we started, and I soon had my revenge. As  we drew near the shore the rollers became higher and higher, and I  perceived that my gentleman clutched the gunwale of the boat very  tightly, and when the first wave that showed signs of breaking overtook  us, he grew very white in the face until it had passed.    The next one or two breakers were small, much to his relief I could see,  though he said nothing. Before he had well recovered his equanimity,  however, a tremendous wave approached us somewhat suddenly. Appalled by  its threatening aspect, he sprang from his seat and seized the arm of  the patrao, who roughly shook him off.    \"My God!\" he cried, \"we are swamped!\" and for the moment it really  looked like it; but the patrao, with a dexterous sweep of his long oar,  turned the boat's head toward the roller. It broke just as it reached  us, and gave us the benefit of its crest, which came in over the  topsides of the boat as it passed by, and deluged every one of us.    I laughed, although it was no laughing matter, at the plight the  liquidator was now in. He was changed in a moment from the spruce and  natty personage into a miserable and draggled being. From every part of  him the salt water was streaming, and the curl was completely taken out  of his whiskers. He could not speak from terror, which the boat-boys  soon saw, for none are quicker than negroes to detect signs of fear  in those whom they are accustomed to consider superior to themselves.  Familiar with the surf, and full of mischievous fun, they began to shout  and gesticulate with the settled purpose of making matters appear worse  than they were, and of enjoying the white man's discomfiture,--all but  the patrao, who was an old hand, and on whom depended the safety of  us all. He kept a steady lookout seaward, and stood upright and firm,  grasping his oar with both hands. With him it was a point of honour to  bring the white men intrusted to his care safely through the surf.    We waited for more than half an hour, bow on, meeting each roller as it  came to us; and by the end of that time the unfortunate liquidator had  evidently given up all hope of ever reaching the shore. Luckily, the  worst was soon to pass. After one last tremendous wave there was a lull  for a few moments, and the patrao, who had watched for such a chance,  swiftly turned the boat round, and giving the word to the crew, they  pulled lustily toward the shore. In a few minutes we were again in  safety. The boat grounded on the beach, the oars were tossed into the  sea; the crew sprang overboard; some of them seized the new arrival; I  clambered on the back of the patrao; a crowd of negroes, who had been  waiting on the beach, laid hold of the tow-rope of the boat, and it and  we were landed simultaneously on the dry sand.    Once on shore Mr. Bransome, for that was the new man's name, rapidly  recovered his presence of mind and manner, and, by way of covering his  past confusion, remarked that he supposed the surf was seldom so bad as  it then was. I replied in an offhand way, meaning to make fun of him,  that what he had passed through was nothing, and appealed to the patrao  to confirm what I had said. That negro, seeing the joke, grinned all  over his black face; and Mr. Bransome, perceiving that he was being  laughed at, snatched a good-sized stick from a native standing near, and  struck the patrao repeatedly over the back.    In vain Sooka, for that was the patrao's name, protested, and demanded  to know what wrong thing he had done. The agent was furious, and  showered his blows upon the black. Equally in vain I shouted that Sooka  had done well by us, and that he, Mr. Bransome, was making an enemy of  a man who would have him now and then in his power. At length Sooka  took to his heels, and sure enough, when he had got a little way off, he  began to threaten vengeance for what he had received. I sympathised with  him, for I knew what a loss to his dignity it was to be beaten without  cause before his fellows, and I feared that Mr. Bransome would indeed be  sorry, sooner or later, for what he had done.    I now suggested to him, by way of diverting his thoughts from poor  Sooka, that standing on the beach in wet clothes was the very way to  catch the coast-fever straight off, and he instantly suffered himself to  be carried up the factory. There Jackson received him in a sort of  \"who on earth are you?\" manner; and Mr. Bransome, clearing his throat,  announced himself and his authority, adding that he intended to make the  factory a point of departure to all the others on the coast; then,  very abruptly, he requested Jackson to prepare quarters for him without  delay.    The change that came over Jackson's face as he learned the quality of  the stranger and his requests was great. The old salt, who had been king  of his house and of the Point for so long a time, had evidently  never even thought of the probability of such an intrusion as was now  presented to him, and he was amazed at what he considered to be the  unwarrantable assurance of the stranger. However, he recovered himself  smartly, and asked the new man if he had any written credentials.    \"Certainly,\" replied he, pulling out a document all wet with salt water.  \"Here is a letter from Messrs. Flint Brothers, of which, no doubt, you  will have a copy in your mail-bag.\"    Jackson took the letter and opened it, and seemed to read it slowly to  himself. All at once he started, looked at the new agent, advanced a  step or two toward him, muttering, \"Bransome, Bransome,\" then stopped  and asked him in a strange constrained voice, \"Is _your_ name Bransome?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the latter, astonished at the old man's question.    \"I knew a Bransome once,\" said Jackson, steadily, \"and he was a  scoundrel.\"    For a moment the two men looked at each other--Jackson with a gleam of  hatred in his eyes, while Bransome had a curiously frightened expression  on his face, which blanched slightly. But he quickly resumed his  composure and peremptory way, and said, \"Show me a room; I must get  these wet things off me.\"    As, however, he addressed himself this time to me rather than to  Jackson,--who, indeed, regarded him no longer, but stood with the letter  loose in his hand, looking at the floor of the room, as if in deep  meditation,--I showed him into my own room, where I ordered his trunks  to be brought. These, of course, were wet; but he found some things in  the middle of them that were not more than slightly damp, and with the  help of a pair of old canvas trousers of mine he managed to make his  appearance at dinner-time.    Jackson was not at the meal. He had left the house shortly after his  interview with the new agent, and had, I fancied, gone on one of his  solitary rambles. At any rate he did not return until late that night.    I thought Mr. Bransome seemed to be somewhat relieved when he saw  that the old man was not coming; and he became more affable than I had  expected him to be, and relinquished his arrogant style altogether when  he began to question me about Jackson--who he was? what had he been?  how long he had lived on the coast? To all which questions I returned  cautious answers, remembering that I was under a promise to the old man  not to repeat his story.    By the next morning, to my surprise, Jackson appeared to have become  reconciled to the fact that he had been superseded by a man who knew  nothing of the coast, and of his own accord he offered to tell Mr.  Bransome the clues to the letter-locks on the doors of the various  store-rooms; for we on the coast used none but letter-locks, which  are locks that do not require a key to open them. But Mr. Bransome  expressed, most politely, a wish that Jackson should consider himself  still in charge of the factory, at"]]]
