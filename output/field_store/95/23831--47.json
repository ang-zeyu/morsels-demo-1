Kaloyan,  the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominions to Belgrade, Nish  and Skopie (Uskub); he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope,  and received the royal crown from a papal legate. The greatest of all  Bulgarian rulers was Ivan Asen II. (1218-1241), a man of humane and  enlightened character. After a series of victorious campaigns he  established his sway over Albania, Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace, and  governed his wide dominions with justice, wisdom and moderation. In his  time the nation attained a prosperity hitherto unknown: commerce, the arts  and literature flourished; Trnovo, the capital, was enlarged and  embellished; and great numbers of churches and monasteries were founded or  endowed. The dynasty of the Asens became extinct in 1257, and a period of  decadence began. Two other dynasties, both of Kuman origin, followed--the  Terterovtzi, who ruled at Trnovo, and the Shishmanovtzi, who founded an  independent state at Vidin, but afterwards reigned in the national capital.  Eventually, on the 28th June 1330, a day commemorated with sorrow in  Bulgaria, Tsar Michael Shishman was defeated and slain by the Servians,  under Stephen Urosh III., at the battle of Velbuzhd (Kiustendil). Bulgaria,  though still retaining its native rulers, now became subject to Servia, and  formed part of the short-lived empire of Stephen Dushan (1331-1355). The  Servian hegemony vanished after the death of Dushan, and the Christian  races of the Peninsula, distracted by the quarrels of their petty princes,  fell an easy prey to the advancing might of the Moslem invader.    _The Turkish Conquest._--In 1340 the Turks had begun to ravage the valley  of the Maritza; in 1362 they captured Philippopolis, and in 1382 Sofia. In  1366 Ivan Shishman III., the last Bulgarian tsar, was compelled to declare  himself the vassal of the sultan Murad I., and to send his sister to the  harem of the conqueror. In 1389 the rout of the Servians, Bosnians and  Croats on the famous field of Kossovo decided the fate of the Peninsula.  Shortly afterwards Ivan Shishman was attacked by the Turks; and Trnovo,  after a siege of three months, was captured, sacked and burnt in 1393. The  fate of the last Bulgarian sovereign is unknown: the national legend  represents him as perishing in a battle near Samakov. Vidin, where Ivan's  brother, Strazhimir, had established himself, was taken in 1396, and with  its fall the last remnant of Bulgarian independence disappeared.    The five centuries of Turkish rule (1396-1878) form a dark epoch in  Bulgarian history. The invaders carried fire and sword through the land;  towns, villages and monasteries were sacked and destroyed, and whole  districts were converted into desolate wastes. The inhabitants of the  plains fled to the mountains, where they founded new settlements. Many of  the nobles embraced the creed of Islam, and were liberally rewarded for  their apostasy; others, together with numbers of the priests and people,  took refuge across the Danube. All the regions formerly ruled by the  Bulgarian tsars, including Macedonia and Thrace, were placed under the  administration of a governor-general, styled the beylerbey of Rum-ili,  residing at Sofia; Bulgaria proper was divided into the sanjaks of Sofia,  Nikopolis, Vidin, Silistria and Kiustendil. Only a small proportion of the  people followed the example of the boyars in abandoning Christianity; the  conversion of the isolated communities now represented by the Pomaks took  place at various intervals during the next three centuries. A new kind of  feudal system replaced that of the boyars, and fiefs or _spahiliks_ were  conferred on the Ottoman chiefs and the renegade Bulgarian nobles. The  Christian population was subjected to heavy imposts, the principal being  the _haratch_, or capitation-tax, paid to the imperial treasury, and the  tithe on agricultural produce, which was collected by the feudal lord.  Among the most cruel forms of oppression was the requisitioning of young  boys between the ages of ten and twelve, who were sent to Constantinople as  recruits for the corps of janissaries. Notwithstanding the horrors which  attended the Ottoman conquest, the condition of the peasantry during the  first three centuries of Turkish government was scarcely worse than it had  been under the tyrannical rule of the boyars. The contemptuous indifference  with which the Turks regarded the Christian _rayas_ was not altogether to  the disadvantage of the subject race. Military service was not exacted from  the Christians, no systematic effort was made to extinguish either their  religion or their language, and within certain limits they were allowed to  retain their ancient local administration and the jurisdiction of their  clergy in regard to inheritances and family affairs. At the time of the  conquest certain towns and villages, known as the _voinitchki sela_,  obtained important privileges which were not infringed till the 18th  century; on condition of [v.04 p.0781] furnishing contingents to the  Turkish army or grooms for the sultan's horses they obtained exemption from  most of the taxes and complete self-government under their _voivodi_ or  chiefs. Some of them, such as Koprivshtitza in the Sredna Gora, attained  great prosperity, which has somewhat declined since the establishment of  the principality. While the Ottoman power was at its height the lot of the  subject-races was far less intolerable than during the period of decadence,  which began with the unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1683. Their rights and  privileges were respected, the law was enforced, commerce prospered, good  roads were constructed, and the great caravans of the Ragusan merchants  traversed the country. Down to the end of the 18th century there appears to  have been only one serious attempt at revolt--that occasioned by the  advance of Prince Sigismund Bathory into Walachia in 1595. A kind of  guerilla warfare was, however, maintained in the mountains by the  _kaiduti_, or outlaws, whose exploits, like those of the Greek _klepkts_,  have been highly idealized in the popular folk-lore. As the power of the  sultans declined anarchy spread through the Peninsula. In the earlier  decades of the 18th century the Bulgarians suffered terribly from the  ravages of the Turkish armies passing through the land during the wars with  Austria. Towards its close their condition became even worse owing to the  horrors perpetrated by the Krjalis, or troops of disbanded soldiers and  desperadoes, who, in defiance of the Turkish authorities, roamed through  the country, supporting themselves by plunder and committing every  conceivable atrocity. After the peace of Belgrade (1737), by which Austria  lost her conquests in the Peninsula, the Servians and Bulgarians began to  look to Russia for deliverance, their hopes being encouraged by the treaty  of Kuchuk Kainarji (1774), which foreshadowed the claim of Russia to  protect the Orthodox Christians in the Turkish empire. In 1794 Pasvanoglu,  one of the chiefs of the Krjalis, established himself as an independent  sovereign at Vidin, putting to flight three large Turkish armies which were  despatched against him. This adventurer possessed many remarkable  qualities. He adorned Vidin with handsome buildings, maintained order,  levied taxes and issued a separate coinage. He died in 1807. The memoirs of  Sofronii, bishop of Vratza, present a vivid picture of the condition of  Bulgaria at this time. \"My diocese,\" he writes, \"was laid desolate; the  villages disappeared--they had been burnt by the Krjalis and Pasvan's  brigands; the inhabitants were scattered far and wide over Walachia and  other lands.\"    _The National Revival._--At the beginning of the 19th century the existence  of the Bulgarian race was almost unknown in Europe, even to students of  Slavonic literature. Disheartened by ages of oppression, isolated from  Christendom by their geographical position, and cowed by the proximity of  Constantinople, the Bulgarians took no collective part in the  insurrectionary movement which resulted in the liberation of Servia and  Greece. The Russian invasions of 1810 and 1828 only added to their  sufferings, and great numbers of fugitives took refuge in Bessarabia,  annexed by Russia under the treaty of Bucharest. But the long-dormant  national spirit now began to awake under the influence of a literary  revival. The precursors of the movement were Paisii, a monk of Mount Athos,  who wrote a history of the Bulgarian tsars and saints (1762), and Bishop  Sofronii, whose memoirs have been already mentioned. After 1824 several  works written in modern Bulgarian began to appear, but the most important  step was the foundation, in 1835, of the first Bulgarian school at Gabrovo.  Within ten years at least 53 Bulgarian schools came into existence, and  five Bulgarian printing-presses were at work. The literary movement led the  way to a reaction against the influence and authority of the Greek clergy.  The spiritual domination of the Greek patriarchate had tended more  effectually than the temporal power of the Turks to the effacement of  Bulgarian nationality. After the conquest of the Peninsula the Greek  patriarch became the representative at the Sublime Porte of the  _Rum-millet_, the Roman nation, in which all the Christian nationalities  were comprised. The independent patriarchate of Trnovo was suppressed; that  of Ochrida was subsequently Hellenized. The Phanariot clergy--unscrupulous,  rapacious and corrupt--succeeded in monopolizing the higher ecclesiastical  appointments and filled the parishes with Greek priests, whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#8)"],[1,"animals, like the weasels, that will also  play with strange friends. But they prefer their own kind as playmates.  They take the greatest delight in playing with their parents, and  nothing is more beautiful or strange than to see several of them playing  in a valley on a sunny day. Out pops one little head, with twinkling  eyes glancing from side to side, and then as if from nowhere, the little  brothers and sisters begin to appear, chasing each other as though they  were playing tag. These exercises give them much agility which they will  need in later life.    I once owned a tame raccoon, and often kept him chained in the back  yard. When he could not find a young chicken or duck to torment, he  devised all kinds of schemes to relieve the monotonous hours. He would  pile up a number of small stones, and carefully await his chance to  fling one into a group of young chickens. He seemed to understand that  he was more apt to make a hit when he threw into a crowd than when  aiming at a single chick. At other times he would lie on his back, madly  waving his tail as though he were signalling for some one to come near.  If we chanced to pass by without speaking, he would growl or whine in  some way to attract attention. After hours of self-amusement he would  lie down as if life were useless, and wait until something or somebody  came along to amuse him. His greatest delight was in fishing things out  of a pan of water, and he would wash every pebble or plaything that he  owned and carefully lay it out to dry. One day he pounced upon a rooster  who insulted him by drinking from his water vessel, and plucked a long  feather from his tail so quickly that we could hardly realise what had  taken place. He then had great fun in attempting to stick the feather in  his head or by planting it upright in the ground. Another day, in  winter, he broke his chain and made straight for the kitchen, where he  found a snug warm place in old Aunt Moriah's kitchen oven. The old  negress came to cook dinner and when the raccoon suddenly sprang out of  her oven, she vowed, \"I'se nevah gwine to cook in dis heah kitchen  again; dis place is hoodooed fo' life!\"    Once we gave him a pail of hot milk, and it was evidently hotter than we  realised; he started to drink it, and suddenly stopped, and in anger  grabbed at a very young puppy that was following us, and before we could  stop him, dipped the puppy's head into the hot milk. Fortunately,  however, the milk was not hot enough to injure the puppy. But the  raccoon had taken his revenge out on the little animal, and was  evidently satisfied.    It is interesting to note that all animals seem to play games and take  exercises that will be especially helpful to them in later life.  Badgers, for example, delight in turning somersaults; deer like to jump  and leap; foxes and raccoons practise stealing upon one unnoticed;  tapirs and crocodiles play in the water as night approaches; mountain  goats, sheep, horses and mules run, leap, jump, and play follow-leader.  Animals that live in the high mountains practise all kinds of  high-jumps, which would be unnecessary if they lived on level ground,  but are highly essential in mountainous countries.    Brehm claims that in summer the chamois climb up to the everlasting snow  and take much delight in playing in it. They will drop into a crouching  position on the top of a very steep mountain, work their four legs with  a swimming motion, and slide down on the surface of the snow for a  hundred and fifty metres. As they slide down the snow flies over them  like a fine powder. As soon as they reach the bottom, they jump to their  feet, and slowly climb up the mountain-side again, while many of their  comrades silently stand by and watch their coasting approvingly, first  one and then another joining in the sport, like human coasters would do.  It is not uncommon for a number of them to tumble together at the  bottom, like romping children. This coasting is very remarkable, and  through skill in it, no doubt, the lives of many chamois are saved from  frightful accidents later in life. Alix tells us that dogs of  mountainous countries are also often skilled in the art of coasting.    Our tame fawn used to delight in playing with our old rabbit-dog,  Nimrod. They were the best of friends, and the fawn would begin the  chase by approaching Nimrod as though he were going to stamp him into  the earth, and then suddenly leaping quickly and safely over the dog, he  would run away. At this signal for a game, if Nimrod was in the mood, he  chased the fawn, who would delight in jumping over fences and hedges and  waiting for poor Nimrod to get over or under just in time to see his  playmate leap to the other side.    Wolves, if taken when quite young, have a most unique way of showing  their affection at the appearance of their master. They will spring into  the air, tumbling over, with whinnying cries of delight, falling to the  ground they pretend to bite and snap at everything, until their friend  finally comes very near them.    Prairie dogs are fond of all kinds of races and jumping games; they will  each appear at the entrance to their underground homes, and will play a  simple form of prisoners'-base for long periods of time. With defiant  calls at each other, one finally approaches the home of the other, which  is a signal for the third to attempt to slip into the entrance to the  second one's home before he can return. Many join in the game and it  usually ends in a regular roll-and-tumble for their respective homes.    Perhaps the strangest of all forms of play is that in which young  duckbills indulge. They are slightly like puppies in their methods of  roll-and-tumble, but the way in which they grab one another with their  strange bills, as they strike with their fore-paws is quite original.  They seem to have an unusually good disposition, and if one little  playfellow falls in the game, and desires to scratch himself before  arising, the other patiently waits until he arises, when the mock battle  begins anew.    Antelopes have chase and marching games which are beautiful. They seem  rapidly to follow an invisible leader over the plains, suddenly forming  themselves into pairs, fours, eights, sixteens, until the entire herd  thus form one line, like an army of soldiers marching. While this game  is progressing, certain of their number stand as sentinels and  spectators, and the slightest approach of an enemy is the signal for all  play to cease, and for them to disappear over the plains.    When we witness these abundant evidences of the need and prevalence of  recreation in the animal world, we are confronted with one more argument  for the existence of real mental and moral faculties among our  four-footed friends.          IV    ARMOUR-BEARING AND MAIL-CLAD ANIMALS      _\"The spectacle of Nature is always new, for she is always    renewing the spectators. Life is her most exquisite invention;    and death is her expert contrivance to get plenty of life.\"_      --GOETHE'S _Aphorisms_ (trans. by HUXLEY).      Civilised nations throughout the world at different times in their  country's history have protected their soldiers and warriors with coats  of armour or mail. This practice prevailed extensively during the Middle  Ages; but it has almost entirely disappeared. The German breastplates of  to-day are an attempted revival. The coats of mail of the ancient  warriors underwent an evolutionary process, until they were indeed  brought to a high pitch of perfection and beauty. It was at this period  that they were abandoned as too burdensome to be of practical value.    This protective form of armour has been used by animals since time  immemorial, and was copied by man from them; and among the various forms  of it are found examples of every kind of armour used in the human  world, from the rough leather shields of hide which the savages use, to  the ornamental suits of mail, like those used by the knights of the  fifteenth century. Indeed, some animals have carried the art of  protection to such an extent that they are veritable movable forts, or  \"tanks!\"    In the early part of the earth's history, animals needed greater  protection from powerful enemies than they do at present, and they  developed a coat of mail, exquisite in appearance and even more  efficient than that used by man. Yet, like mankind, they have found  newer and more efficient methods of protection, and as a result of  changed conditions and enemies, have discarded, at least most of them,  their coats of mail and armour. Most of those who have held to the  old-fashioned ways of fighting and facing the world, have, like  unprogressive peoples, perished; and to-day only a few armour-bearing  animals exist. These classes, however, have never been very large, and  consist of two small families; the pangolins and the armadillos. The  former live in southern Asia and Africa, while the latter are  inhabitants of South America.    These animals have a great advantage over man, for their armour grows  upon their bodies and is a part of them, while man must put his on and  take it off and continually replace the worn-out parts. Again, while  there are only three distinct kinds of human armour--the chain, scale  and plate armour--there are many kinds of animal armour. What wonderful  opportunities exist to-day in the great museums for studying the  different kinds of animal armour, for those who are interested!    The scaly ant-eater, who is at home in Africa and Asia, is one of the  most unusual and original types of mail-clad animals. He might be  compared to a wolf in outline, covered from head to tail in huge, horny  plates, which look like immense finger-nails overlapping each other. His  head sharpens out into a long, narrow snout, which contains a sticky,  worm-like tongue, and this he can use with great rapidity and effect in  raiding an ant-hill. He drops his tongue"]]]
