Hullo!\"--the laughter was gone from his eyes, and they were steely  hard again--\"what the blazes have we here?\"    He picked up the net. \"What! A bird-trap!\"    \"Exactly!\" I said.    Smith turned his searching gaze upon me. \"Where did you find it,  Petrie?\"    \"I did not exactly find it,\" I replied; and I related to him the  circumstances of my meeting with Karamaneh.    He directed that cold stare upon me throughout the narrative, and  when, with some embarrassment, I had told him of the girl's escape--    \"Petrie,\" he said succinctly, \"you are an imbecile!\"    I flushed with anger, for not even from Nayland Smith, whom I esteemed  above all other men, could I accept such words uttered as he had  uttered them. We glared at one another.    \"Karamaneh,\" he continued coldly, \"is a beautiful toy, I grant you;  but so is a cobra. Neither is suitable for playful purposes.\"    \"Smith!\" I cried hotly, \"drop that! Adopt another tone or I cannot  listen to you!\"    \"You _must_ listen,\" he said, squaring his lean jaw truculently. \"You  are playing, not only with a pretty girl who is the favourite of a  Chinese Nero, but with _my life_! And I object, Petrie, on purely  personal grounds!\"    I felt my anger oozing from me; for this was strictly just. I had  nothing to say and Smith continued:    \"You _know_ that she is utterly false, yet a glance or two from those  dark eyes of hers can make a fool of you! A woman made a fool of me  once, but I learned my lesson; you have failed to learn yours. If you  are determined to go to pieces on the rock that broke up Adam, do so!  But don't involve me in the wreck, Petrie, for that might mean a  yellow emperor of the world, and you know it!\"    \"Your words are unnecessarily brutal, Smith,\" I said, feeling very  crestfallen, \"but there--perhaps I fully deserve them all.\"    \"You _do_!\" he assured me, but he relaxed immediately. \"A murderous  attempt is made upon my life, resulting in the death of a perfectly  innocent man in no way concerned. Along you come and let an  accomplice, perhaps a participant, escape, merely because she has a  red mouth, or black lashes, or whatever it is that fascinates you so  hopelessly!\"    He opened the wicker basket, sniffing at the contents.    \"Ah!\" he snapped, \"do you recognize this odour?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then you have some idea respecting Karamaneh's quarry?\"    \"Nothing of the kind!\"    Smith shrugged his shoulders.    \"Come along, Petrie,\" he said, linking his arm in mine.    We proceeded. Many questions there were that I wanted to put to him,  but one above all.    \"Smith,\" I said, \"what, in Heaven's name, were you doing on the mound?  Digging something up?\"    \"No,\" he replied, smiling dryly, \"burying something!\"          CHAPTER VI    UNDER THE ELMS      Dusk found Nayland Smith and me at the top bedroom window. We knew,  now that poor Forsyth's body had been properly examined, that he had  died from poisoning. Smith, declaring that I did not deserve his  confidence, had refused to confide in me his theory of the origin of  the peculiar marks upon the body.    \"On the soft ground under the trees,\" he said, \"I found his tracks  right up to the point where--something happened. There were no other  fresh tracks for several yards around. He was attacked as he stood  close to the trunk of one of the elms. Six or seven feet away I found  some other tracks, very much like this.\"    He marked a series of dots upon the blotting-pad, for this  conversation took place during the afternoon.    \"Claws!\" I cried. \"That eerie call! like the call of a nighthawk--is  it some unknown species of--flying thing?\"    \"We shall see, shortly; possibly to-night,\" was his reply. \"Since,  probably owing to the absence of any moon, a mistake was made\"--his  jaw hardened at the thought of poor Forsyth--\"another attempt along  the same lines will almost certainly follow--you know Fu-Manchu's  system?\"    So in the darkness, expectant, we sat watching the group of nine elms.  To-night the moon was come, raising her Aladdin's lamp up to the star  world and summoning magic shadows into being. By midnight the  high-road showed deserted, the common was a place of mystery; and save  for the periodical passage of an electric car, in blazing modernity,  this was a fit enough stage for an eerie drama.    No notice of the tragedy had appeared in print; Nayland Smith was  vested with powers to silence the Press. No detectives, no special  constables, were posted. My friend was of opinion that the publicity  which had been given to the deeds of Dr. Fu-Manchu in the past,  together with the sometimes clumsy co-operation of the police, had  contributed not a little to the Chinaman's success.    \"There is only one thing to fear,\" he jerked suddenly; \"he may not be  ready for another attempt to-night.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Since he has only been in England for a short time, his menagerie of  venomous things may be a limited one at present.\"    Earlier in the evening there had been a brief but violent  thunderstorm, with a tropical downpour of rain, and now clouds were  scudding across the blue of the sky. Through a temporary rift in the  veiling the crescent of the moon looked down upon us. It had a  greenish tint, and it set me thinking of the filmed, green eyes of  Fu-Manchu.    The cloud passed and a lake of silver spread out to the edge of the  coppice; where it terminated at a shadow bank.    \"There it is, Petrie!\" hissed Nayland Smith.    A lambent light was born in the darkness; it rose slowly, unsteadily,  to a great height, and died.    \"It's under the trees, Smith!\"    But he was already making for the door. Over his shoulder:    \"Bring the pistol, Petrie!\" he cried; \"I have another. Give me at  least twenty yards' start or no attempt may be made. But the instant  I'm under the trees, join me.\"    Out of the house we ran, and over on to the common, which latterly had  been a pageant-ground for phantom warring. The light did not appear  again; and as Smith plunged off toward the trees, I wondered if he  knew what uncanny thing was hidden there. I more than suspected that  he had solved the mystery.    His instructions to keep well in the rear I understood. Fu-Manchu, or  the creature of Fu-Manchu, would attempt nothing in the presence of a  witness. But we knew full well that the instrument of death which was  hidden in the elm coppice could do its ghastly work and leave no clue,  could slay and vanish. For had not Forsyth come to a dreadful end  while Smith and I were within twenty yards of him?    Not a breeze stirred, as Smith, ahead of me--for I had slowed my  pace--came up level with the first tree. The moon sailed clear of the  straggling cloud wisps which alone told of the recent storm; and I  noted that an irregular patch of light lay silvern on the moist ground  under the elms where otherwise lay shadow.    He passed on, slowly. I began to run again. Black against the silvern  patch, I saw him emerge--and look up.    \"Be careful, Smith!\" I cried--and I was racing under the trees to join  him.    Uttering a loud cry, he leaped--away from the pool of light.    \"Stand back, Petrie!\" he screamed. \"Back! farther!\"    He charged into me, shoulder lowered, and sent me reeling!    Mixed up with his excited cry I had heard a loud splintering and  sweeping of branches overhead; and now as we staggered into the  shadows it seemed that one of the elms was reaching down to touch us!  So, at least, the phenomenon presented itself to my mind in that  fleeting moment while Smith, uttering his warning cry, was hurling me  back.    Then the truth became apparent.    With an appalling crash, a huge bough fell from above. One piercing  awful shriek there was, a crackling of broken branches, and a choking  groan....    The crack of Smith's pistol close beside me completed my confusion of  mind.    \"Missed!\" he yelled. \"Shoot it, Petrie! On your left! For God's sake  don't miss it!\"    I turned. A lithe black shape was streaking past me. I  fired--once--twice. Another frightful cry made yet more hideous the  nocturne.    Nayland Smith was directing the ray of a pocket torch upon the fallen  bough.    \"Have you killed it, Petrie?\" he cried.    \"Yes, yes!\"    I stood beside him, looking down. From the tangle of leaves and twigs  an evil yellow face looked up at us. The features were contorted with  agony, but the malignant eyes, wherein light was dying, regarded us  with inflexible hatred. The man was pinned beneath the heavy bough;  his back was broken; and, as we watched, he expired, frothing slightly  at the mouth, and quitted his tenement of clay leaving those glassy  eyes set hideously upon us.    \"The pagan gods fight upon our side,\" said Smith strangely. \"Elms have  a dangerous habit of shedding boughs in still weather--particularly  after a storm. Pan, god of the woods, with this one has performed  Justice's work of retribution.\"    \"I don't understand. Where was this man--?\"    \"Up the tree, lying along the bough which fell, Petrie! That is why he  left no footmarks. Last night no doubt he made his escape by swinging  from bough to bough, ape-fashion, and descending to the ground  somewhere at the other side of the coppice.\"    He glanced at me.    \"You are wondering, perhaps,\" he suggested, \"what caused the  mysterious light? I could have told you this morning, but I fear I was  in a bad temper, Petrie. It's very simple; a length of tape soaked in  spirit or something of the kind, and sheltered from the view of any  one watching from your windows, behind the trunk of the tree; then,  the end ignited, lowered, still behind the tree, to the ground. The  operator swinging it around, the flame ascended, of course. I found  the unburned fragment of the tape used last night, a few yards from  here.\"    I was peering down at Fu-Manchu's servant, the hideous yellow man "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#8)"],[1,"bronze tools.  They also chose a portion of the world where climate was a factor in  keeping their memory green.    \"The Greeks built in stone, wrote their books, kept their history to  bequeath it to their successors, and so did the Romans. And on this side  of the ocean the Incas, the Mayas, the unknown races before them, and  the Aztecs of Mexico all built in stone and worked in metal. And stone  and metal survive. But what if there had been an early people who used  plastics and brittle alloys, who had no desire to build permanent  buildings, whose tools and artifacts were meant to wear out quickly,  perhaps for economic reasons? What would they leave us--considering,  perhaps, that an ice age had intervened between their time and ours,  with glaciers to grind into dust what little they did possess?    \"There is evidence that the poles of our world have changed and that  this northern region was once close to being tropical. Any catastrophe  violent enough to bring about a switch in the poles of this planet might  well have wiped out all traces of a civilization, no matter how  superior. We have good reason to believe that such a people must have  existed, but we must find them.    \"And Ashe is a convert from the skeptics--\" the major slipped down from  his perch on the wall shelf--\"he is an archaeologist, one of your tomb  discoverers, and knows what he is talking about. We must do our hunting  in time earlier than the first pyramid, earlier than the first group of  farmers who settled by the Tigris River. But we have to let the enemy  guide us to it. That's where you come in.\"    \"Why me?\"    \"That is a question to which our psychologists are still trying to find  the answer, my young friend. It seems that the majority of the people of  the several nations linked together in this project have become too  civilized. The reactions of most men to given sets of circumstances have  become set in regular patterns and they cannot break that conditioning,  or if personal danger forces them to change those patterns, they are  afterward so adrift they cannot function at their highest potential.  Teach a man to kill, as in war, and then you have to recondition him  later.    \"But during these same wars we also develop another type. He is the born  commando, the secret agent, the expendable man who lives on action.  There are not many of this kind, and they are potent weapons. In  peacetime that particular collection of emotions, nerve, and skills  becomes a menace to the very society he has fought to preserve during a  war. He is pressured by the peaceful environment into becoming a  criminal or a misfit.    \"The men we send out from here to explore the past are not only given  the best training we can possibly supply for them, but they are all of  the type once heralded as the frontiersman. History is sentimental about  that type--when he is safely dead--but the present finds him difficult  to live with. Our time agents are misfits in the modern world because  their inherited abilities are born out of season now. They must be young  enough and possess a certain brand of intelligence to take the stiff  training and to adapt, and they must pass our tests. Do you understand?\"    Ross nodded. \"You want crooks because they are crooks----\"    \"No, not because they are crooks, but because they are misfits in their  time and place. Don't, I beg of you, Murdock, think that we are  operating a penal institution here. You would never have been recruited  if you hadn't tested out to suit us. But the man who may be labeled  murderer in his own period might rank as a hero in another, an extreme  example, but true. When we train a man he not only can survive in the  period to which he is sent, but he can also pass as a native born in  that era----\"    \"What about Hardy?\"    The major gazed into space. \"There is no operation which is foolproof.  We have never said that we don't run into trouble or that there is no  danger in this. We have to deal with both natives of different times,  and if we are lucky and hit a hot run, with the Reds. They suspect that  we are casting about, hunting their trail. They managed to plant Kurt  Vogel on us. He had an almost perfect cover and conditioning. Now you  have it straight, Murdock. You satisfy our tests, and you'll be given a  chance to say yes or no before your first run. If you say no and refuse  duty, it means you must become an exile and stay here. No man who has  gone through our training can return to normal life; there is too much  chance of his being picked up and sweated by the opposition.\"    \"Never?\"    The major shrugged. \"This may be a long-term operation. We hope not, but  there is no way of telling now. You will be in exile until we either  find what we want or fail entirely. That is the last card I have to lay  on the table.\" He stretched. \"You're slated for training tomorrow. Think  it over and then let us know your answer when the time comes. Meanwhile,  you are to be teamed with Ashe, who will see to putting you through the  course.\"    It was a big hunk to swallow, but once down, Ross found it digestible.  The training opened up a whole new world to him. Judo and wrestling were  easy enough to absorb, and he thoroughly enjoyed the workouts. But the  patient hours of archery practice, the strict instruction in the use of  a long-bladed bronze dagger were more demanding. The mastering of one  new language and then another, the intensive drill in unfamiliar social  customs, the memorizing of strict taboos and ethics were difficult. Ross  learned to keep records in knots on hide thongs and was inducted into  the art of primitive bargaining and trade. He came to understand the  worth of a cross-shaped tin ingot compared to a string of amber beads  and some well-cured white furs. He now understood why he had been shown  a traders' caravan during that first encounter with the purpose behind  Operation Retrograde.    During the training days his feeling toward Ashe changed materially. A  man could not work so closely with another and continue to resent his  attitude; either he blew up entirely, or he learned to adjust. His awe  at Ashe's vast amount of practical knowledge, freely offered to serve  his own blundering ignorance, created a respect for the man which might  have become friendship, had Ashe ever relaxed his own shield of  impersonal efficiency. Ross did not try to breach the barrier between  them mainly because he was sure that the reason for it was the fact  that he was a \"volunteer.\" It gave him an odd new feeling he avoided  trying to analyze. He had always had a kind of pride in his record; now  he had begun to wish sometimes that it was a record of a different type.    Men came and went. Hodaki and his partner disappeared, as did Jansen and  his. One lost track of time within that underground warren which was the  base. Ross gradually discovered that the whole establishment covered a  large area under an external crust of ice and snow. There were  laboratories, a well-appointed hospital, armories which stocked weapons  usually seen only in museums, but which here were free of any signs of  age, and ready for use. There were libraries with mile upon mile of tape  recordings as well as films. Ross could not understand everything he  heard and saw, but he soaked up all he could so that once or twice, when  drifting off to sleep at night, he thought of himself as a sponge which  had nearly reached its total limit of absorption.    He learned to wear naturally the clumsy kilt-tunic he had seen on the  wolf slayer, to shave with practiced assurance, using a leaf-shaped  bronze razor, to eat strange food until he relished the taste. Making  lesson time serve a double duty, he lay under sunlamps while listening  to tape recordings, until his skin darkened to a weathered hue  resembling Ashe's. There was always talk to listen to, important talk  which he was afraid to miss.    \"Bronze.\" Ashe weighed a dagger in his hand one day. Its hilt, made of  dark horn studded with an intricate pattern of tiny golden nail heads,  had a gleam not unlike that of the blade. \"Do you know, Murdock, that  bronze can be tougher than steel? If it wasn't that iron is so much more  plentiful and easier to work, we might never have come out of the Bronze  Age? Iron is cheaper and easier found, and when the first smith learned  to work it, an end came to one way of life, a beginning to another.    \"Yes, bronze is important to us here, and so are the men who worked it.  Smiths were sacred in the old days. We know that they made a secret of  their trade which overrode the bounds of district, tribe, and race. A  smith was welcome in any village, his person safe on the road. In fact,  the roads themselves were under the protection of the gods; there was  peace on them for all wayfarers. The land was wide then, and it was  empty. The tribes were few and small, and there was plenty of room for  the hunter, the farmer, the trader. Life was not such a scramble of man  against man, but rather of man against nature----\"    \"No wars?\" asked Ross. \"Then why the bow-and-dagger drill?\"    \"Wars were small affairs, disputes between family clans or tribes. As  for the bow, there were formidable things in the forests--giant animals,  wolves, wild boars----\"    \"Cave bears?\"    Ashe sighed with weary patience. \"Get it through your head, Murdock,  that history is much longer than you seem to think. Cave bears and the  use of bronze weapons do not overlap. No, you will have to go back maybe  several thousand years earlier and then hunt your bear with a  flint-tipped spear in your hand if you are fool enough to try it.\"    \"Or take a rifle with you.\" Ross made a suggestion he had longed to  voice for some time.    Ashe rounded on him swiftly, and Ross knew him well enough now to  realize that he was seriously displeased.    \"That is just what you don't do, Murdock, not from this base, as you  well know by now."]]]
