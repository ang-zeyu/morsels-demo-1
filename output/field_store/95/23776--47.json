Therefore the word of grace and of the promised remission of sin must  also be preached, in order to teach and set up faith, since without  that word contrition, penitence, and all other duties, are performed and  taught in vain.    There still remain, it is true, preachers of repentance and grace, but  they do not explain the law and the promises of God to such an end, and  in such a spirit, that men may learn whence repentance and grace are to  come. For repentance comes from the law of God, but faith or grace  from the promises of God, as it is said, \"Faith cometh by hearing, and  hearing by the word of God\" (Rom. x. 17), whence it comes that a man,  when humbled and brought to the knowledge of himself by the threatenings  and terrors of the law, is consoled and raised up by faith in the Divine  promise. Thus \"weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the  morning\" (Psalm xxx. 5). Thus much we say concerning works in general,  and also concerning those which the Christian practises with regard to  his own body.    Lastly, we will speak also of those works which he performs towards his  neighbour. For man does not live for himself alone in this mortal body,  in order to work on its account, but also for all men on earth; nay, he  lives only for others, and not for himself. For it is to this end that  he brings his own body into subjection, that he may be able to serve  others more sincerely and more freely, as Paul says, \"None of us liveth  to himself, and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live  unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord\" (Rom. xiv. 7,  8). Thus it is impossible that he should take his ease in this life, and  not work for the good of his neighbours, since he must needs speak, act,  and converse among men, just as Christ was made in the likeness of men  and found in fashion as a man, and had His conversation among men.    Yet a Christian has need of none of these things for justification and  salvation, but in all his works he ought to entertain this view and look  only to this object--that he may serve and be useful to others in all  that he does; having nothing before his eyes but the necessities and the  advantage of his neighbour. Thus the Apostle commands us to work with  our own hands, that we may have to give to those that need. He might  have said, that we may support ourselves; but he tells us to give to  those that need. It is the part of a Christian to take care of his own  body for the very purpose that, by its soundness and well-being, he may  be enabled to labour, and to acquire and preserve property, for the aid  of those who are in want, that thus the stronger member may serve the  weaker member, and we may be children of God, thoughtful and busy one  for another, bearing one another's burdens, and so fulfilling the law of  Christ.    Here is the truly Christian life, here is faith really working by love,  when a man applies himself with joy and love to the works of that freest  servitude in which he serves others voluntarily and for nought, himself  abundantly satisfied in the fulness and riches of his own faith.    Thus, when Paul had taught the Philippians how they had been made  rich by that faith in Christ in which they had obtained all things,  he teaches them further in these words: \"If there be therefore any  consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of  the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be  like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let  nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind  let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his  own things, but every man also on the things of others\" (Phil. ii. 1-4).    In this we see clearly that the Apostle lays down this rule for a  Christian life: that all our works should be directed to the advantage  of others, since every Christian has such abundance through his faith  that all his other works and his whole life remain over and above  wherewith to serve and benefit his neighbour of spontaneous goodwill.    To this end he brings forward Christ as an example, saying, \"Let this  mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form  of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of  no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made  in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled  Himself, and became obedient unto death\" (Phil. ii. 5-8). This most  wholesome saying of the Apostle has been darkened to us by men who,  totally misunderstanding the expressions \"form of God,\" \"form of a  servant,\" \"fashion,\" \"likeness of men,\" have transferred them to the  natures of Godhead and manhood. Paul's meaning is this: Christ, when He  was full of the form of God and abounded in all good things, so that He  had no need of works or sufferings to be just and saved--for all these  things He had from the very beginning--yet was not puffed up with these  things, and did not raise Himself above us and arrogate to Himself power  over us, though He might lawfully have done so, but, on the contrary,  so acted in labouring, working, suffering, and dying, as to be like the  rest of men, and no otherwise than a man in fashion and in conduct, as  if He were in want of all things and had nothing of the form of God; and  yet all this He did for our sakes, that He might serve us, and that all  the works He should do under that form of a servant might become ours.    Thus a Christian, like Christ his Head, being full and in abundance  through his faith, ought to be content with this form of God, obtained  by faith; except that, as I have said, he ought to increase this faith  till it be perfected. For this faith is his life, justification, and  salvation, preserving his person itself and making it pleasing to God,  and bestowing on him all that Christ has, as I have said above, and  as Paul affirms: \"The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the  faith of the Son of God\" (Gal. ii. 20). Though he is thus free from all  works, yet he ought to empty himself of this liberty, take on him the  form of a servant, be made in the likeness of men, be found in fashion  as a man, serve, help, and in every way act towards his neighbour as he  sees that God through Christ has acted and is acting towards him.  All this he should do freely, and with regard to nothing but the good  pleasure of God, and he should reason thus:--    Lo! my God, without merit on my part, of His pure and free mercy, has  given to me, an unworthy, condemned, and contemptible creature all the  riches of justification and salvation in Christ, so that I no longer  am in want of anything, except of faith to believe that this is so.  For such a Father, then, who has overwhelmed me with these inestimable  riches of His, why should I not freely, cheerfully, and with my whole  heart, and from voluntary zeal, do all that I know will be pleasing to  Him and acceptable in His sight? I will therefore give myself as a sort  of Christ, to my neighbour, as Christ has given Himself to me; and will  do nothing in this life except what I see will be needful, advantageous,  and wholesome for my neighbour, since by faith I abound in all good  things in Christ.    Thus from faith flow forth love and joy in the Lord, and from love  a cheerful, willing, free spirit, disposed to serve our neighbour  voluntarily, without taking any account of gratitude or ingratitude,  praise or blame, gain or loss. Its object is not to lay men under  obligations, nor does it distinguish between friends and enemies, or  look to gratitude or ingratitude, but most freely and willingly spends  itself and its goods, whether it loses them through ingratitude, or  gains goodwill. For thus did its Father, distributing all things to all  men abundantly and freely, making His sun to rise upon the just and the  unjust. Thus, too, the child does and endures nothing except from the  free joy with which it delights through Christ in God, the Giver of such  great gifts.    You see, then, that, if we recognize those great and precious gifts, as  Peter says, which have been given to us, love is quickly diffused in  our hearts through the Spirit, and by love we are made free, joyful,  all-powerful, active workers, victors over all our tribulations,  servants to our neighbour, and nevertheless lords of all things. But,  for those who do not recognise the good things given to them through  Christ, Christ has been born in vain; such persons walk by works, and  will never attain the taste and feeling of these great things. Therefore  just as our neighbour is in want, and has need of our abundance, so we  too in the sight of God were in want, and had need of His mercy. And as  our heavenly Father has freely helped us in Christ, so ought we freely  to help our neighbour by our body and works, and each should become to  other a sort of Christ, so that we may be mutually Christs, and that  the same Christ may be in all of us; that is, that we may be truly  Christians.    Who then can comprehend the riches and glory of the Christian life? It  can do all things, has all things, and is in want of nothing; is lord  over sin, death, and hell, and at the same time is the obedient and  useful servant of all. But alas! it is at this day unknown throughout  the world; it is neither preached nor sought after, so that we are quite  ignorant about our own name, why we are and are called Christians. We  are certainly called so from Christ, who is not absent, but dwells among  us--provided, that is, that we believe in Him and are reciprocally and  mutually one the Christ of the other, doing to our neighbour as Christ  does to us. But now, in the doctrine of men, we are taught only to seek  after merits, rewards, and things which are already ours, and we have  made of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#8)"],[1,"wall of a farm called Hangingshaw, about 200 yards from the Roman road  which runs along the high ground a little east of Appleby. It then  became plain--despite Huebner's errors--that this stone was that recorded  in Gough's papers, although his copy was in one point faulty and on the  other hand some letters which were visible in 1694 have now apparently  perished. A rubbing sent me by the late Rev. A. Warren of Old Appleby  helped further; I now give from the three sources--Gough's copy, the  photograph, and the rubbing--what I hope may be a fairly accurate text.  I premise that the letters RCO in line 2, LIPPO in 3, PHILIPPO in 8, IMO  in 9, and I in 10 seem to be no longer visible but depend on Gough's  copy.

This misled Huebner into treating line 7 (ERP) as a blundered reading of  that necessary word. In reality, line 7 is the most interesting item in  the inscription. It shows that the Emperor Philip was, here at least,  styled _perpetuus Augustus_. That is an appellation to which I find no  exact parallel in Philip's other inscriptions or indeed in any other  imperial inscriptions till half a century after his death. It fits,  however, into a definite development of the Roman imperial titles. In  the earliest Empire, phrases occur, mostly on coins, such as _Aeternitas  imperii_ or _Aeternitas populi romani_. Soon the notion of the stability  of the Empire was transferred to its rulers. As early as Vespasian,  coins bear the legend _aeternitas Augusti_, and in the first years  of the second century Pliny, writing to Trajan, speaks of petitions  addressed _per salutem tuam aeternitatemque_ and of 'works worthy of  the emperor's eternity,' (_opera aeternitate tua digna_). Late in the  second century such phrases become commoner. With Severus Alexander  (A.D. 221-35) coins begin to show the legend _Perpetuitas Aug._, and  before very long the indirect and abstract language changes into direct  epithets which are incorporated in the emperors' titulature. The first  case which I can find of this is that before us, of Philip (A.D. 244-9);  a little later, Aurelian (A.D. 270-5) is styled _semper Augustus_ and,  from Diocletian onwards, _aeternus_, _perpetuus_, and _semper Augustus_  belong to the customary titulature. Constantine I, for example, is  called on one stone _invictus et perpetuus ... semper Augustus_, on  another _perpetuus imperator, semper Augustus_. That Philip should have  been the first to have applied to him, even once, the direct epithet, is  probably a mere accident. One might have wished to connect it with his  Secular Games, celebrated in 248. But by that time his son was no longer  Caesar but full Augustus (since 246), and our stone must fall into the  years 244-6.    The ideas underlying these epithets were perhaps mixed. Notions of or  prayers for the long life of the Empire, the stability of the reigning  house, the long reign of the current emperor, may have jostled with  notions of the immortality of the emperors and their deification, and  with the eastern ideas which poured into Rome as the second century  ended and the third century began.[9] The hardening despotism of the  imperial constitution, growing more and more autocratic every decade,  also helped. As the emperor became unchecked and unqualified monarch,  his appellations grew more emphatic; _perpetuus Augustus, semper  Augustus_ connoted that unchecked and autocratic rule.

PUBLICATIONS RELATING TO ROMAN BRITAIN IN 1914      The following summary of the books and articles on Roman Britain which  appeared in 1914 is grouped under two heads, first, those few which deal  with general aspects of the subject, and secondly, the far larger number  which concern special sites or areas. In this second class, those which  belong to England are placed under their counties in alphabetical order,  while those which belong to Wales and Scotland are grouped under these  two headings. I have in general admitted only matter which was published  in 1914, or which bears that date.      1. GENERAL    (1) Mr. G. L. Cheesman's _Auxilia of the Roman Imperial Army_ (Oxford  University Press) does not deal especially with Roman Britain, but it  deserves brief notice here. It is an excellent and up-to-date sketch  of an important section of the Roman army, with which British  archaeologists are much concerned. It also contains valuable lists,  which can be found nowhere else, of the 'auxiliary' regiments stationed  in Britain (pp. 146-9 and 170-1). It is full, cheap, compact; every  historical and archaeological library should get it.    (2) A learned and scholarly attempt to settle the obscure chronology of  the north British frontiers in the fourth century has been made by Mr.  H. Craster, Fellow of All Souls, and one of the excavators of Corbridge,  in the _Archaeological Journal_ (lxxi. 25-44). His conclusions are novel  and, though to some extent disputable, are well worth printing. Starting  from the known fact that, during much of the third century, the north  frontier of Roman Britain coincided roughly with the line of Cheviot and  was then withdrawn to the line of Hadrian's Wall, he distinguishes five  stages in the subsequent history. (1) At or just before the outset of  the fourth century, in the reign of Diocletian, the Wall was reorganized  in some ill-recorded fashion. (2) Thirty years later, towards the end  of Constantine's reign, about A.D. 320-30, it was (he thinks) further  reorganized; perhaps its mile-castles were then discarded. (3) Thirty or  forty years later still, after disturbances which (he conjectures)  included the temporary loss of Hadrian's Wall and the destruction of its  garrisons, Theodosius carried out in 369 a fuller reorganization. This  garrison had consisted of the regiments known to us by various evidence  as posted 'per lineam valli' in the third and early fourth centuries;  their places were now filled by soldiers of whom we know absolutely  nothing. (4) In 383 Maximus withdrew these unknown troops for his  continental wars. Now perhaps the line of the Wall had to be given up,  but Tyne and Solway, South Shields, Corbridge, and Carlisle were still  held. (5) Finally, about 395-9, Stilicho ordered a last reorganization;  he withdrew the frontier from the Tyne to the Tees, from Carlisle to  Lancaster, and garrisoned the new line with new soldiery--those, namely,  which are listed in the Notitia as serving under the Dux Britanniarum,  save only the regiments 'per lineam valli'; these last the compiler of  the Notitia borrowed from the older order to disguise the loss of the  Wall. Even this did not last. In 402 Stilicho had to summon troops to  Italy for home defence--among them, Mr. Craster suggests, the Sixth  Legion--and in 407 the remaining Roman soldiers, including the Second  Legion, were taken to the continent by Constantine III.    Every one who handles this difficult period must indulge in conjecture;  Mr. Craster has, perhaps, indulged rather much. It might be simpler  to connect the abandonment of the mile-castles--his stage 2--with the  recorded troubles which called Constans to Britain in 343, rather than  invent an unrecorded action by Constantine I. I hesitate also to assume  for the period 369-83 an otherwise unknown frontier garrison, which has  left no trace of itself. I feel still greater doubt respecting the years  383-99. Here Mr. Craster argues from coin-finds. No coins have been  found on the line of the Wall which were minted later than 383, and none  at Corbridge, Carlisle, and South Shields which were minted later than  395; therefore, he infers, the Wall was abandoned soon after 383, and  the other sites soon after 395. This is too rigid an argument. It may  be a mere accident that the Wall has as yet yielded no coin which was  minted between 383 and 395. At Wroxeter, for example, two small hoards  were found some years ago which had clearly been lost at the moment  when the town was sacked. By these hoards we should be able to date the  catastrophe. Now the latest coin in one hoard was minted in or before  377, and the latest in the other in or before 383. But newer finds show  that Wroxeter was not destroyed at earliest till after 390. Again,  as Mr. Craster himself says, the coining of Roman copper practically  stopped in 395; after that year the older copper issues appear to have  remained in use for many a long day. That is clear in Gaul, where coins  later than 395 seem to be rare, although Roman armies and influences  were present for another fifty years. When Mr. Craster states that  'archaeology gives no support to the theory that the Tyne-Solway line  was held after 395', he might add that it gives equally little support  to the theory that it was not held after 395.    Incidentally, he offers a new theory of the two chapters in the Notitia  Dignitatum which describe the forces commanded by the Comes Litoris  Saxonici and the Dux Britanniarum (_Occ._ 28 and 40). It is agreed  that these chapters do not exhibit the garrison of Britain at the moment  when the Notitia was substantially completed, about A.D. 425, for the  good reason that there was then no garrison left in the island; they  exhibit some garrison which had then ceased to exist, and which is  mentioned, apparently, to disguise the loss of the province. The  question is, to what date do they refer? Mommsen long ago pointed out  that the regiments enumerated in one part of them (the 'per lineam  valli' section) are very much the same as"]]]
