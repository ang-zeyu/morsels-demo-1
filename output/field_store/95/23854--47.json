I only       observed the alternation in the sounds, and Paganini and his       surroundings seemed to me again suddenly changed. I could scarcely       recognize him in the monk's brown dress, which concealed rather       than clothed him. With savage countenance half-hid by the cowl,       waist girt with a cord, and bare feet, Paganini stood, a solitary       defiant figure, on a rocky prominence by the sea, and played his       violin. But the sea became red and redder, and the sky grew paler,       till at last the surging water looked like bright, scarlet blood,       and the sky above became of a ghastly corpse-like pallor, and the       stars came out large and threatening; and those stars were       black--black as glooming coal. But the tones of the violin grew       ever more stormy and defiant, and the eyes of the terrible player       sparkled with such a scornful lust of destruction, and his thin       lips moved with such a horrible haste, that it seemed as if he       murmured some old accursed charms to conjure the storm and loose       the evil spirits that lie imprisoned in the abysses of the sea.       Often, when he stretched his long, thin arm from the broad monk's       sleeve, and swept the air with his bow, he seemed like some       sorcerer who commands the elements with his magic wand; and then       there was a wild wailing from the depth of the sea, and the       horrible waves of blood sprang up so fiercely that they almost       besprinkled the pale sky and the black stars with their red foam.       There was a wailing and a shrieking and a crashing, as if the world       was falling into fragments, and ever more stubbornly the monk       played his violin. He seemed as if by the power of violent will he       wished to break the seven seals wherewith Solomon sealed the iron       vessels in which he had shut up the vanquished demons. The wise       king sank those vessels in the sea and I seemed to hear the voices       of the imprisoned spirits while Paganini's violin growled its most       wrathful bass.         But at last I thought I heard the jubilee of deliverance, and out       of the red billows of blood emerged the heads of the fettered       demons: monsters of legendary horror, crocodiles with bats' wings,       snakes with stags' horns, monkeys with shells on their heads, seals       with long patriarchal beards, women's faces with one eye, green       camels' heads, all staring with cold, crafty eyes, and long,       fin-like claws grasping at the fiddling monk. From the latter,       however, in the furious zeal of his conjuration, the cowl fell back       and the curly hair, fluttering in the wind, fell round his head in       ringlets, like black snakes.         So maddening was this vision that to keep my senses I closed my       ears and shut my eyes. When I again looked up the specter had       vanished, and I saw the poor Genoese in his ordinary form, making       his ordinary bows, while the public applauded in the most rapturous       manner.         \"That is the famous performance upon G,\" remarked my neighbor. \"I       myself play the violin, and I know what it is to master the       instrument.\" Fortunately, the pause was not considerable, or else       the musical furrier would certainly have engaged me in a long       conversation upon art. Paganini again quietly set his violin to his       chin, and with the first stroke of his bow the wonderful       transformation of melodies again began.         They no longer fashioned themselves so brightly and corporeally.       The melody gently developed itself, majestically billowing and       swelling like an organ chorale in a cathedral, and everything       around, stretching larger and higher, had extended into a colossal       space which, not the bodily eye, but only the eye of the spirit       could seize. In the midst of this space hovered a shining sphere,       upon which, gigantic and sublimely haughty, stood a man who played       the violin. Was that sphere the sun? I do not know. But in the       man's features I recognized Paganini, only ideally lovely, divinely       glorious, with a reconciling smile. His body was in the bloom of       powerful manhood, a bright blue garment enclosed his noble limbs,       his shoulders were covered by gleaming locks of black hair; and as       he stood there, sure and secure, a sublime divinity, and played the       violin, it seemed as if the whole creation obeyed his melodies. He       was the man-planet about which the universe moved with measured       solemnity and ringing out beatific rhythms. Those great lights,       which so quietly gleaming swept around, were they stars of heaven,       and that melodious harmony which arose from their movements, was it       the song of the spheres, of which poets and seers have reported so       many ravishing things? At times, when I endeavored to gaze out into       the misty distance, I thought I saw pure white garments floating       ground, in which colossal pilgrims passed muffled along with white       staves in their hands, and singular to relate, the golden knob of       each staff was even one of those great lights which I had taken for       stars. These pilgrims moved in a large orbit around the great       performer, the golden knobs of their staves shone even brighter at       the tones of the violin, and the chorale which resounded from their       lips, and which I had taken for the song of the spheres, was only       the dying echo of those violin tones. A holy, ineffable ardor dwelt       in those sounds, which often trembled scarce audibly, in mysterious       whisper on the water, then swelled out again with a shuddering       sweetness, like a bugle's notes heard by moonlight, and then       finally poured forth in unrestrained jubilee, as if a thousand       bards had struck their harps and raised their voices in a song of       victory.           *       *       *       *       *    In Seventeen Hundred Eighty-four, Niccolo Paganini was born at Genoa.  His father was a street-porter who eked out the scanty exchequer by  playing a violin at occasional dances or concerts. That his playing was  indifferent is evident from the fact that he was very poor--his services  were not in demand.    The poverty of the family and the failure of the father fired the  ambition of the boy to do something worthy. When he was ten years old he  could play as well as his father, and a year or so thereafter could play  better. The lad was tall, slender, delicate and dreamy-eyed. But he had  will plus, and his desire was to sound the possibilities of the violin.  And this reminds me that Hugh Pentecost says there is no such thing as  will--it is all desire: when we desire a thing strongly enough, we have  the will to secure it--but no matter!    Young Niccolo Paganini practised on his father's violin for six hours a  day; and now when the customers who used to hire his father to play  came, they would say, \"We just as lief have Niccolo.\"    Soon after this they said, \"We prefer to have Niccolo.\" And a little  later they said, \"We must have Niccolo.\" Some one has written a book to  show that playing second fiddle is just as worthy an office as playing  first. This doubtless is true, but there are so many more men who can  play second, that it behooves every player to relieve the stress by  playing first if he can. Niccolo played first and then was called upon  to play solos. He was making twice as much money as his father ever had,  but the father took all the boy's earnings, as was his legal right. The  father's pride in the success of the son, the young man always said, was  because he was proving a good financial investment. It does not always  pay to raise children--this time it did. It was finally decided to take  the boy to the celebrated musician, Rolla, for advice as to what was  best to do about his education. Rolla was sick abed at the time the boy  called and could not see him; but while waiting in the entry the lad  took up a violin and began to play. The invalid raised himself on one  elbow and pantingly inquired who the great master was that had thus  favored him with a visit.    \"It's the lad who wants you to give him lessons,\" answered the  attendant.    \"Impossible! no lad could play like that--I can teach that player  nothing!\"    Next the musician Paer was visited, and he passed the boy along to  Giretta, who gave him three lessons a week in harmony and counterpoint.  The boy had abrupt mannerisms and tricks of his own in bringing out  expressions, and these were such a puzzle to the teacher that he soon  refused to go on.    Niccolo possessed a sort of haughty self-confidence that aggravated the  master; he believed in himself and was fond of showing that he could  play in a way no one else could. Adolescence had turned his desire to  play into a fury of passion for his art: he practised on single passages  for ten or twelve hours a day, and would often sink in a swoon from  sheer exhaustion. This deep, torpor-like sleep saved him from complete  collapse, just as it saved Mendelssohn, and he would arise to go on with  his work.    Paganini's wisdom was shown at this early age in that he limited his  work to a few compositions, and these he made the most of, just as they  say Bossuet secured his reputation as the greatest preacher of his time  by a single sermon that he had polished to the point of perfection.    When fifteen years old Paganini contrived to escape from his father and  went to a musical festival at Lucca. He managed to get a hearing, was  engaged at once as a soloist, and soon after gave a concert on his own  account. In a month he had accumulated a thousand pounds in cash.    Very naturally, such a success turned the head of this lad who never  before had had the handling of money. He began to gamble, and became the  dupe of rogues--male and female--who plunged him into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#8)"],[1," a very fine Perpendicular window. All, however,  except the upper part of the centre of these seeming windows is really  panel-work. The old Norman main arch of the triforium may be seen behind  this panelling, under the present clerestory windows.    Until recently the mass above pressed very heavily on the nave-vaulting,  but during the last and preceding years (1896-7) the strain has been  relieved by the insertion of new supplementary timbers above the  original Hempage Forest beams, which can still be seen by those who  wish. The cost of this work of repairing the roof and vault has been  about L9000, and so far has not at all exceeded the original estimate.  In August 1897 a large amount still remained to be subscribed. As seen  from below each division of the vault is \"bounded by two  vaulting-shafts, which rise to the level of the clerestory window-sill  and send out from above the capital nine diverging ribs to the  ridge-rib, by which the whole vault is divided into a series of bisected  and interlacing lozenges, as the basis for all the groining\" (Woodward).    [Illustration: WEST WINDOW, FROM NAVE. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    The general effect of the nave can be gathered from the illustrations,  which bring out well the appearance of height which is bound to impress  the spectator standing near the central western door. In the nave aisles  also a fine view may be obtained, the comparative narrowness  counteracting the lessened height. As one looks down the church towards  the west, it will be noticed that the western interior wall is  practically entirely filled by the great window, for not only does this  stretch across the whole width, but the mullions also are carried right  down to the floor-level, a double series of panels occupying the space  below the sill of the window. The glass in the window proper is, for the  most part, very old, and, as is pointed out elsewhere (see p. 94), is  arranged in patterns after the fashion of a kaleidoscope. This arises  from the fact that the fragments of which it is composed are entirely  disjointed, and probably incapable of being pieced together.    The monuments and objects of interest in the nave are numerous, but  chief perhaps are, on the north side, the Minstrels' Gallery, the old  grill-work, and the font; and, on the south side, the chantries of  Bishops Wykeham and Edingdon. But, first of all, though not on account  of pre-eminent merit, should be mentioned the bronze statues of James I.  and Charles I. to the north and south of the main west door, against the  interior wall. They were executed by Le Sueur, the artist who executed  the fine equestrian figure of Charles I. at Charing Cross. A note on the  sculptor's payment for these bronzes may be seen in the \"Record of  Exchequer,\" from which it appears that he received L340 for the two,  with a further L40 for \"carrying and erecting them\" at Winchester.    In the north-west corner stands the #Minstrels' Gallery# or #Tribune#,  the work of Edingdon. It is supported by two flattened arches springing  from the pier shafts, and is panelled on its face and spandrels The  panelling is decorated with flowered cusps, and the central bosses bear  the arms of Wykeham. This gallery appears to have been intended for use  on State occasions; now, however, it is merely used as a room in which  the episcopal registers may be stored. In height it extends half-way up  the neighbouring piers.    [Illustration: IRON GRILL-WORK FROM S. SWITHUN'S SHRINE.  _From Mr Starkie Gardiner's \"Iron-work\" Vol I., by permission of the  Science and Art Department, South Kensington._]    Near this, at the western end of the north aisle, is a door made up of  four pieces of iron #Grill-work#, which originally stood at the top of  the steps leading up from the south transepts to the retro-choir. The  place where it used to be is still pointed out, and indeed marks are  visible in the piers to which it was secured. A paper read to the  Society of Arts by Mr J. Starkie Gardiner, describes the door as being,  from its style, \"the oldest piece of grill-work in England. The design  is composed of sprays formed of two rolls of scrolls, welded to a  central stem, like a much-curled ostrich feather, with lesser scrolls in  the interstices and the major scrolls, each terminating in an open-work  trefoil, or quinquefoil. The large scrolls are 5-1/2 in. in diameter and  rather stout, the grill possessing great resisting powers, though it  would not be hard to climb.... There is, unfortunately, no means of  fixing the date, since no other grill resembles it; but, from the  position indicated in the cathedral, it may well have been made as long  ago as the eleventh or twelfth century.\" It was originally intended to  keep the miscellaneous crowd of pilgrims to the shrine of S. Swithun  from penetrating farther into the church by way of the south transept.  They were obliged to enter and depart by the Norman doorway in the north  transept.    It will not be necessary to record all the monuments and the brasses  which so abundantly cover the walls, but those of the greatest interest  will be alluded to. In the fifth bay of the north aisle are two  memorials of very different dates, those of the \"Two Brothers of  Avington\" (1662), and of the novelist, Jane Austen, the youngest  daughter of the rector of Steventon in Hampshire. Her monumental brass  is affixed to the wall below the other, which records how the two  brothers were \"both of Oxford, both of the Temple, both Officers to  Queen Elizabeth and our noble King James. Both Justices of the Peace,  both agree in arms, the one a Knight, the other a Captain.\"    In the next bay, opposite the Norman Font, is an inscription relating to  Mrs Montagu, the founder of the \"Blue Stocking\" Club. It is to this  effect:--\"Here lies the body of Elizabeth Montagu, daughter of Matthew  Robinson, Esq., of West Layton, in the County of York, who, possessing  the united advantages of beauty, wit, judgment, reputation, and riches,  and employing her talents most uniformly for the benefit of mankind,  might be justly deemed an ornament to her sex and country. She died on  the 25th August, 1800, aged 81.\"    The #Norman Font#, which Milner called _crux antiquariorum_, is situated  on the north side of the nave between the fifth and sixth pillars from  the west front. It is one of a group of seven found in England; of which  four are in Hampshire, at East Meon, S. Michael's (Southampton), S. Mary  Bourne, and Winchester; two in Lincolnshire, in the cathedral and at  Thornton Curtis; and one at S. Peter's, Ipswich. Of four similar fonts  on the Continent, that at Zedelghem, near Bruges, is most like the  Winchester example, and also illustrates the same legend. The material  of which these fonts are made is a bluish-black calcareous marble, such  as is still worked at Tournai in Hainault. The font before us is a  nearly square block of marble supported on a solid central column  ornamented with horizontal mouldings, with four disengaged pillars of  lesser diameter, with \"cable\" mouldings, at each corner. The spandrels  of the top are decorated with carved symbolic subjects, leaves and  flowers on two sides, and on the other two doves drinking from vases out  of which issue crosses, typifying baptism, it is said. It is rather  curious that the artist has disregarded the usual symmetry, and filled  his spaces without reference to the corresponding ones. On the north and  east faces of the font are three circular medallions with symbolic doves  and salamanders. On the south and west are scenes from the life of S.  Nicholas of Myra, as was fully demonstrated by Milner; the north side  showing the saint dowering the three daughters of a poor nobleman, while  on the west he restores to life a drowned person, probably the king's  son in one of the stories of his life, and rescues from death by the axe  three young men who are about to be slain either by the executioner or  by a wicked innkeeper, for there are two versions. Some authorities  would find four scenes represented on the west side; but on what grounds  it is difficult to see. There only appear to be two figures of the  saint, and the two scenes are divided by what looks like a short  vertical bar indicating a difference of subject (see p. 117). The cult  of S. Nicholas of Myra grew rapidly in the twelfth century, being  popularised by the crusaders. In this century it is known that the  carved work at Tournai, whence it is probable that the black marble  came, was remarkable for its symbolism. The font has been thought to be  older, on account of its archaic figures, but, as the Dean of Winchester  pointed out in a paper read before the Archaeological Association in  1893 (to which we are indebted for much of this account), the mitre  which S. Nicholas is represented as wearing was not recognised as part  of a bishop's official dress until the very end of the eleventh century;  in fact, the particular form of mitre depicted appears to have been late  twelfth century. The conclusion naturally arrived at is that the font is  of Belgian origin, carved at Tournai between 1150-1200, and its presence  at Winchester may well be due either to Henry of Blois or to Toclive.    [Illustration: THE NORMAN FONT--SOUTH AND WEST SIDES.  _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    On the north side of the steps leading up to the choir is a brass tablet  on a pillar, recording the merits of the \"renowned martialist,\" Colonel  Richard Boles, who fought on the king's side at Edgehill, and died  bravely in a small action at Alton, Southampton, in 1641, his party of  sixty being surprised by a large force of the rebels. \"His gracious  sovereign hearing of his Death gave him high Commendation, in that  passionate expression,--Bring me a Moorning scarf, I have lost one of  the best Commanders in the Kingdome.\" Between the ninth and tenth  pillars on this side is the tomb of Bishop Morley,"]]]
