[Illustration: THE TOWER ARCHES.]    [Illustration: NORTH TRANSEPT AND CROSSING.]    The #Nave Aisles# were widened in the fourteenth century, the  Norman walls being removed and their roofs raised; a single stone of the  weather moulding, which may be seen on the west face of the north  transept, shows the height and slope of the roof of the Norman aisle.  The windows of the aisles on either side are two-light Decorated  windows; the three on either side to the east of the north and south  porches are of the same character, while the two on each side to the  west of the porches are also alike but differ in their tracery from  those to the east. The south porch is much smaller than the north, and  is very plain; it is composed of two solid walls projecting six feet  from the wall of the aisle.    The #Transepts#, as has been described in the preceding chapter,  were lengthened in the fourteenth century--the southern one by the  incorporation of some low Norman building, thought by some to have been  the Lady Chapel, the walls of which were raised; the northern one by the  addition of Bembre's chantry. This has caused the north transept to be  somewhat longer than the south. The original Norman transepts seem to  have been of the same length on either side. Bembre, who died in 1361,  is supposed to have been buried here. A stone slab lay until 1857 in the  centre of the pavement,--on it was a representation of a full-length  figure of a man dressed in a robe like a surplice; but when the pavement  was renewed this stone was allowed to remain exposed to sun and rain in  the churchyard until the surface was weathered to such an extent that it  is now impossible to make out with any certainty what is upon it. But  the description given by Hutchins of the arms on the shields which were  sculptured on it does not agree with the Bembre arms, so that it could  hardly have been the tombstone of this Dean who founded the chantry.  The window at the end of the north transept is modern restoration work.  Before 1891 the tracery was of a very plain character, as may be seen  from the illustration (page 21). It is supposed that damage was done to  this window at the time when the tower fell, and that the plain tracery  was inserted after that event. During the restoration in 1891, the old  plaster was removed from the walls, and in doing this a Norman altar  recess was discovered in the east wall of this transept; the southern  end of this had been cut away when the choir aisle was widened in the  fourteenth century. In this recess traces of fresco may be seen. A  piscina stands to the north of this altar recess, and is of Decorated  character.    [Illustration: THIRTEENTH-CENTURY PISCINA IN SOUTH TRANSEPT.]    The #South Transept# has a five-light Decorated window at its southern  end, with modern tracery in imitation of the old, each light running up  through the head of the window. A very fine Early English piscina, with  the characteristic dog-tooth moulding, stands in the south wall. An  altar occupying a position similar to the one in the north transept used  to stand in this transept also, but the pointed arch over the recess  shows that it was of later date.    [Illustration: CHOIR STALLS.]    The most elaborate part of the church is that which lies to the east of  the central tower. The great height to which the altar is raised above  the level of the nave gives it a very impressive appearance from the  west end; and, again, the view looking westward from the altar level is  much enhanced by the height from which it is seen.    [Illustration: WEST VIEW FROM THE CHOIR.]    The #East End# is purely English work, and this shows that in the  thirteenth century the church was extended about 30 feet towards the  east. The junction of the Early English with the Norman wall is marked  by a cluster of slender shafts rising from the ground. The alterations  which were made in the Norman walls at the time of this eastward  extension have been already described (p. 11).    It now only remains to describe the #Choir# and #Presbytery# as they  stand at the present time. Immediately to the east of the tower on  either side are two pointed arches of two plain orders rising on their  western sides from plain brackets in the tower piers, and supported on  the east by engaged shafts with roughly-carved Norman capitals. Next  to these come the Early English inserted arches, pierced as already  described through the Norman wall and cutting away the lower part of two  previously existing Norman windows on each side. The arches are of three  plain orders, with chamfered edges, resting on clustered shafts; beyond  these the new thirteenth-century work begins. Beyond the clustered  shafts mentioned above, which mark the commencement of the Early English  work, is a lofty arch on either side opening into the choir aisles; over  each of them is a pair of small lancet windows widely splayed inside.  Between the piers of these arches a wall is carried, its top being about  midway between their bases and capitals. On the southern wall stands the  Beaufort tomb, on the northern the Courtenay tomb; and below this the  walls are pierced with arches, beneath which are flights of nine steps  leading on to the crypt beneath the presbytery. It is not improbable  that after the eastern extension the altar stood at the east end of the  Norman part of the choir, and that under these two Early English arches  was the ambulatory or processional passage which is so often found to  the east of the high altar. Beyond the ends of the choir aisles on  either side of the presbytery is a lancet window. The east window is  worthy of the closest observation. Its exterior appearance has been  already described (p. 24). Within, it consists of three openings widely  splayed; the thin stone over the central lancet, beneath the surrounding  moulding, is pierced with a quatrefoil opening; over the two side  lancets the corresponding openings have six foliations; between the  three lights and outside the outer ones, flush with the wall, are  clusters of shafts of Purbeck marble, from which spring mouldings  enclosing the lights in a most peculiar fashion: these follow the curves  of the tops of the lancets, but before meeting they are returned in the  form of cusps, and then are carried round the upper foliated openings.  The upper part of each of these mouldings forms about three-quarters  of the circumference of a circle. The characteristic Early English  dog-tooth ornament is carved round the moulding of the central light,  those round the other lights are not thus decorated. The whole group is  surrounded by a label following the curves of moulding, with carved  heads at its terminations and points of junction. The six cusps of the  moulding are ornamented by bosses of carved foliage.    [Illustration: THE EAST WINDOW.]    [Illustration: SEDILIA.]    To the south side of the presbytery, between the south window and the  Beaufort tomb, the triple #Sedilia# and the #Piscina# are situated: each  of these is covered by a canopy of fourteenth-century work. These were  extensively repaired at the time of the restoration. The Beaufort altar  tomb is the finest monument in the church. On it are two recumbent  figures carved in alabaster, and although there is no inscription it is  certain that they represent John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and his  wife Margaret. John Beaufort was son of another John Beaufort, Earl of  Somerset, who was brother of the celebrated Cardinal Beaufort, and son  of John of Gaunt by his mistress Catherine Swynford, a family afterwards  legitimatised by Parliament. This second John Beaufort distinguished  himself in the French wars of Henry IV., who in 1443 gave him a step in  the peerage, creating him Duke of Somerset. His wife Margaret was, when  he married her, widow of Oliver St John, and it is thought that after  the death of her second husband in 1444 she married again. This John and  Margaret, Duke and Duchess of Somerset, are famous on account of their  daughter the Lady Margaret, so well-known for her educational endowments  and for the fact that after her marriage with Edmund Tudor, the Earl  of Richmond, she became the mother of that Henry Tudor who overthrew  Richard III. at Bosworth, and was crowned King as Henry VII. Here  on this altar tomb their effigies remain in a wonderful state of  preservation, their right hands clasped together, angels at their heads,  his feet resting on a dog, hers on an antelope. He is completely clad  in armour, the face and right hand only bare--the gauntleted left hand  holds the right hand gauntlet, which he has taken off that he may hold  the lady's hand. She is clad in a long close-fitting garment. Each of  the two wears around the neck a collar marked with the letters SS. At  the apex of the arch above their tomb hangs his tourney helm.    [Illustration: THE BEAUFORT TOMB.]    Under the corresponding arch on the opposite side is a similar tomb, but  without any effigy. The fragment of an inscription tells us that it is  the tomb of one who was once the wife of Henry Courtenay, Marquis of  Exeter, and mother of Edward Courtenay. She was Gertrude, daughter of  William Blount, Lord Mountjoy. Her husband was beheaded in 1538,  together with the aged Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, whose chantry  may be seen in the Priory at Christchurch, though she was laid to rest  in what Macaulay describes as the saddest burying-ground in England, the  cemetery of St Peter's, in the Tower. Gertrude, Lady Courtenay, was  herself attainted at the time of her husband's execution, but was  afterwards pardoned and died in 1557. The tomb was opened in the last  century from idle curiosity, and some one attempted to raise the body to  a sitting posture,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#8)"],[1,"region dread.      Many a tree she stood and gazed on--many a river passed she o'er;      Passed she many a pleasant mountain--many a wild deer, many a bird;      Many a hill and many a cavern--many a bright and wondrous stream,      Saw king Bhima's wandering daughter--as she sought her husband lost.        Long she roamed her weary journey--Damayanti with sweet smile,      Lo, a caravan of merchants--elephants, and steeds, and cars,      And beyond, a pleasant river--with its waters cool and clear.      'Twas a quiet stream, and waveless--girt about with spreading canes;      There the cuckoo, there the osprey--there the red-geese clamouring stood;      Swarmed the turtles, fish and serpents--there rose many a stately isle.        When she saw that numerous concourse--Nala's once all-glorious wife,      Entered she, the slender-waisted--in the midst of all the host;      Maniac-like in form and feature--and in half a garment clad,      Thin and pallid, travel-tainted--matted all her locks with dust.      As they all beheld her standing--some in terror fled away;      Some stood still in speechless wonder--others raised their voice and cried;      Mocked her some with cruel tauntings--others spake reproachful words;      Others looked on her with pity--and enquired her state, her name.      \"Who art thou? whose daughter. Lady--in the forest seek'st thou aught?      At thy sight we stand confounded--art thou of our mortal race?      Of this wood art thou the goddess?--of this mountain? of that plain?      Who art thou, O noble Lady--thee, our refuge, we adore.      Art thou sylvan nymph or genius--or celestial nymph divine?      Every-way regard our welfare--and protect us, undespised:      So our caravan in safety--may pursue its onward way,      So ordain it, O illustrious!--that good fortune wait on all.\"      Thus addressed by that assemblage--Damayanti, kingly-born,      Answered thus with gentle language--grieving for her husband lost.      Of that caravan the leader--and the whole assembled host,      Youths and boys, and grey-haired elders--and the guides, thus answered she:      \"Know me, like yourselves, a mortal--daughter of a king of men,      Of another king the consort--seeking for my royal lord;      Know, Vidarbha's king, my father--and Nishadha's king, my lord,      Nala, is his name, the glorious--him, th' unconquered do I seek;      Know ye aught of that good monarch--tell me, quick, of my beloved,      Of the tiger hero, Nala--slayer of a host of foes.\"        Of the caravan the captain--thus the lovely-limbed addressed,      Suchi was his name, the merchant--\"Hear, illustrious queen, my speech;      Of this caravan the captain--I, O Lady with sweet smile,      Him that bears the name of Nala--nowhere have these eyes beheld.      Elephants, and pards, and tigers--lynxes, buffaloes, and bears,      See I in this trackless forest--uninhabited by men;      Save thyself, of human feature--nought, or human form, I've seen.      So may he, the king of Yakshas--Manibhadra, guard us well.\"[91]      To the merchants then she answered--to the leader of the host,      \"Tell me whither do ye travel!--whither bound your caravan?\"        _The_ CAPTAIN _of the caravan spake._        \"To the realm of Chedi's sovereign[92]--truth-discerning Subahu,      Soon this caravan will enter--travelling in search of gain.\"          BOOK XIII.          [93]This, the lovely princess hearing--from the captain of the band,      With the caravan set forward--seeking still her royal lord.      Long their journey through the forest--through the dark and awful glens;      Then a lake of loveliest beauty--fragrant with the lotus flowers,      Saw those merchants, wide and pleasant--with fresh grass and shady trees;      Flowers and fruits bedecked its borders--where the birds melodious sang:      In its clear delicious waters--soul-enchanting, icy cool,      With their horses all o'erwearied--thought they then to plunge and bathe;      At the signal of the captain--entered all that pleasant grove.      At the close of day arriving--there encamped they for the night.        When the midnight came, all noiseless--came in silence deep and still,      Weary slept the band of merchants--lo, a herd of elephants,[94]      Oozing moisture from their temples--came to drink the troubled stream.      When that caravan they gazed on--with their slumbering beasts at rest,      The tame elephants they scented--those wild forest elephants;      Forward rush they fleet and furious--mad to slay, and wild with heat;      Irresistible the onset--of the rushing ponderous beasts,      As the peaks from some high mountain--down the valley thundering roll;      Strewn was all the way before them--with the boughs, the trunks of trees;      On they crash'd to where the travellers--slumbered by the lotus lake.      Trampled down without a struggle--helpless on the earth they lay,      \"Woe, oh, woe!\" shrieked out the merchants--wildly some began to fly,      In the forest thickets' plunging;--some stood gasping, blind with sleep;      And the elephants down beat them--with their tusks, their trunks, their          feet.      Many saw their camels dying--mingled with the men on foot,      And in frantic tumult rushing--wildly struck each other down;      Many miserably shrieking--cast them down upon the earth,      Many climbed the trees in terror--on the rough ground stumbled some.      Thus in various wise and fatal--by the elephants assailed,      Lay that caravan so wealthy--scattered all abroad or slain.      Such, so fearful was the tumult--the three worlds seemed all appalled,[95]      \"'Tis a fire amid th' encampment--save ye, fly ye, for your lives.      Lo, your precious pearls ye trample--take them up, why fly so fast?      Save them, 'tis a common venture--fear ye not that I deceive.\"      Thus t' each other shrieked the merchants--as in fear they scattered round.      \"Yet again I call upon you--cowards! think ye what ye do.\"      All around this frantic carnage--raging through the prostrate host,      Damayanti, soon awakened--with her heart all full of dread;      There she saw a hideous slaughter--the whole world might well appal.      To such sights all unfamiliar--gazed the queen with lotus eyes,      Pressing in her breath with terror--slowly rose she on her feet.      And the few that scaped the carnage--few that scaped without a wound,      All at once exclaimed together--\"Of whose deeds is this the doom?      Hath not mighty Manibhadra--adoration meet received.      And Vaisravana the holy[96]--of the Yakshas lord and king,      Have not all that might impede us--ere we journied, been addressed?      Was it doomed, that all good omens--by this chance should be belied!      Were no planets haply adverse?--how hath fate, like this, befall'n!\"      Others answered in their misery--reft of kindred and of wealth,      \"Who is that ill-omened woman--that with maniac-staring eyes,      Joined our host, misshaped in aspect--and with scarcely human form?      Surely all this wicked witchcraft--by her evil power is wrought;      Witch or sorceress she, or daemon--fatal cause of all our fears,      Hers is all the guilt, the misery--who such damning proof may doubt?      Could we but behold that false one--murtheress, bane of all our host,      With the clods, the dust, the bamboos--with our staves, or with our hands,      We would slay her on the instant--of our caravan the fate.\"      But no sooner Damayanti--their appalling words had heard,      In her shame and in her terror--to the forest shade she fled.      And that guilt imputed dreading--thus her fate began to wail:      \"Woe is me, still o'er me hovers--the terrific wrath of fate;      No good fortune e'er attends me--of what guilt is this the doom?      Not a sin can I remember--not the least to living man.      Or in deed, or thought, or language--of what guilt is this the doom?      In some former life committed[97]--expiate I now the sin.      To this infinite misfortune--hence by penal justice doomed?      Lost my husband, lost my kingdom--from my kindred separate;      Separate from noble Nala--from my children far away,      Widowed of my rightful guardian--in the serpent-haunted wood.\"        Of that caravan at morning--then the sad surviving few,      Setting forth from that dread region--o'er that hideous carnage grieve;      Each a brother mourns, or father--or a son, or dearest friend,      Still Vidarbha's princess uttered--\"What the sin that I have done?      Scarcely in this desert forest--had I met this host of men,      By the elephants they perish--this is through my luckless fate;      A still lengthening life of sorrow--I henceforth must sadly lead.      Ere his destined day none dieth--this of aged seers the lore;      Therefore am not I too trampled--by this herd of furious beasts.      Every deed of living mortal--by over-ruling fate is done.      Yet no sin have I committed--in my blameless infancy,      To deserve this dire disaster--or in word, or deed, or thought.      For the choosing of my husband--are the guardians of the world,      Angry are the gods, rejected--for the noble Nala's sake?      From my lord this long divorcement--through their power do I endure.\"      Thus the noblest of all women--to bewail her fate began,      The deserted Damayanti--with these sad and bitter words;      With some Veda-reading Brahmins--that survived that scattered host,      Then she went her way in sadness--like the young moon's sickle pale,      And ere long a mighty city--that afflicted queen drew near:      'Twas the king of Chedi's city--truth-discerning Subahu.      Scantly clad in half a garment--entered she that stately town;      Her disturbed, emaciate, wretched--with dishevelled hair, unwashed,      Like a maniac, onward-moving--saw that city's wondering throng;      Gazing on her as she entered--to the monarch's royal seat;      All the boys her"]]]
