[26] Samuel Richardson, the father of the English novel,      wrote _Pamela_, _Clarissa Harlowe_, and the _History of      Sir Charles Grandison_, novels published in the form of      letters.    When we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there  could be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach. So  we dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore. Some people came  down to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the  wind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as  to understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made  signs, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not  understand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and  night coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should  abate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if  we could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was  still wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd  thro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he. In this manner  we lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating the  next day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been  thirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottle  of filthy rum, and the water we sail'd on being salt.    In the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but,  having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a  fever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentifully most of the  night, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I  proceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington,  where I was told I should find boats that would carry me the rest of  the way to Philadelphia.    [Illustration: It rained very hard all the day]    It rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noon  a good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,  beginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable a  figure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspected  to be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that  suspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening  to an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr.  Brown. He entered into conversation with me while I took some  refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable  and friendly. Our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He had  been, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was no town in  England, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very  particular account. He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much  of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to  travesty the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. By  this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and  might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it  never was.    At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd  Burlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boats  were gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to go  before Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old  woman in the town, of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the  water, and ask'd her advice. She invited me to lodge at her house till  a passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foot  traveling, I accepted the invitation. She understanding I was a  printer, would have had me stay at that town and follow my business,  being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with. She was very  hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will,  accepting only of a pot of ale in return; and I thought myself fixed  till Tuesday should come. However, walking in the evening by the side  of the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towards  Philadelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, as  there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, not  having yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must  have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we  were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old  fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold,  in October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the  company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little above  Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and  arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, and  landed at the Market-street wharf.    I have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and  shall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your  mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since  made there. I was in my working dress, my best clothes being to come  round by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out  with shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for  lodging. I was fatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest, I  was very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch  dollar, and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people  of the boat for my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my  rowing; but I insisted on their taking it. A man being sometimes more  generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,  perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little.    Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I  met a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring  where he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to,  in Second-street, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in  Boston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I  asked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not  considering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater  cheapness nor the names of his bread, I bade him give me three-penny  worth of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I  was surpris'd at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my  pockets, walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.  Thus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the  door of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the  door, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,  ridiculous appearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and  part of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round,  found myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to  which I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with  one of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came  down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.    [Illustration: \"She, standing at the door, saw me, and thought I made,  as I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous appearance\"]    Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had  many clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I  joined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the  Quakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round  awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labour and want  of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continu'd so till  the meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was,  therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.    Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of  people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,  accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get  lodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. \"Here,\"  says he, \"is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a  reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better.\"  He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got a  dinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked  me, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I  might be some runaway.    After dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed, I lay  down without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call'd  to supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till next  morning. Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to Andrew  Bradford the printer's. I found in the shop the old man his father,  whom I had seen at New York, and who, traveling on horseback, had got  to Philadelphia before me. He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd  me civilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present  want a hand, being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another  printer in town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ  me; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he would  give me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should  offer.    The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; and  when we found him, \"Neighbour,\" says Bradford, \"I have brought to see  you a young man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one.\" He  ask'd me a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see how  I work'd, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had just  then nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never  seen before, to be one of the town's people that had a good will for  him, enter'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#8)"],[1,"only the senses of contact and temperature  present with any degree of clearness; taste soon follows; vision of an  imperfect sort in a few days; hearing about the same time, and smell a  little later. The senses are waking up and beginning their acquaintance  with the outside world.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--A NEURONE FROM A HUMAN SPINAL CORD. The central  portion represents the cell body. N, the nucleus; P, a pigmented or  colored spot; D, a dendrite, or relatively short fiber,--which branches  freely; A, an axon or long fiber, which branches but little.]    THE WORK OF THE SENSES.--And what a problem the senses have to solve! On  the one hand the great universe of sights and sounds, of tastes and  smells, of contacts and temperatures, and whatever else may belong to  the material world in which we live; and on the other hand the little  shapeless mass of gray and white pulpy matter called the brain,  incapable of sustaining its own shape, shut away in the darkness of a  bony case with no possibility of contact with the outside world, and  possessing no means of communicating with it except through the senses.  And yet this universe of external things must be brought into  communication with the seemingly insignificant but really wonderful  brain, else the mind could never be. Here we discover, then, the two  great factors which first require our study if we would understand the  growth of the mind--_the material world without, and the brain within_.  For it is the action and interaction of these which lie at the bottom of  the mind's development. Let us first look a little more closely at the  brain and the accompanying nervous system.      3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM    It will help in understanding both the structure and the working of the  nervous system to keep in mind that it contains _but one fundamental  unit of structure_. This is the neurone. Just as the house is built up  by adding brick upon brick, so brain, cord, nerves and organs of sense  are formed by the union of numberless neurones.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Neurones in different stages of development,  from _a_ to _e_. In _a_, the elementary cell body alone is present; in  _c_, a dendrite is shown projecting upward and an axon downward.--After  DONALDSON.]    THE NEURONE.--What, then, is a neurone? What is its structure, its  function, how does it act? A neurone is _a protoplasmic cell, with its  outgrowing fibers_. The cell part of the neurone is of a variety of  shapes, triangular, pyramidal, cylindrical, and irregular. The cells  vary in size from 1/250 to 1/3500 of an inch in diameter. In general the  function of the cell is thought to be to generate the nervous energy  responsible for our consciousness--sensation, memory, reasoning, feeling  and all the rest, and for our movements. The cell also provides for the  nutrition of the fibers.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Longitudinal (a) and Transverse (b) section of  nerve fiber. The heavy border represents the medullary, or enveloping  sheath, which becomes thicker in the larger fibers.--After DONALDSON.]    NEURONE FIBERS.--The neurone fibers are of two kinds, _dendrites_ and  _axons_. The dendrites are comparatively large in diameter, branch  freely, like the branches of a tree, and extend but a relatively short  distance from the parent cell. Axons are slender, and branch but little,  and then approximately at right angles. They reach a much greater  distance from the cell body than the dendrites. Neurones vary greatly in  length. Some of those found in the spinal cord and brain are not more  than 1/12 of an inch long, while others which reach from the extremities  to the cord, measure several feet. Both dendrites and axons are of  diameter so small as to be invisible except under the microscope.    NEUROGLIA.--Out of this simple structural element, the neurone, the  entire nervous system is built. True, the neurones are held in place,  and perhaps insulated, by a kind of soft cement called _neuroglia_. But  this seems to possess no strictly nervous function. The number of the  microscopic neurones required to make up the mass of the brain, cord and  peripheral nervous system is far beyond our mental grasp. It is computed  that the brain and cord contain some 3,000 millions of them.    COMPLEXITY OF THE BRAIN.--Something of the complexity of the brain  structure can best be understood by an illustration. Professor Stratton  estimates that if we were to make a model of the human brain, using for  the neurone fibers wires so small as to be barely visible to the eye, in  order to find room for all the wires the model would need to be the size  of a city block on the base and correspondingly high. Imagine a  telephone system of this complexity operating from one switch-board!    \"GRAY\" AND \"WHITE\" MATTER.--The \"gray matter\" of the brain and cord is  made up of nerve cells and their dendrites, and the terminations of  axons, which enter from the adjoining white matter. A part of the mass  of gray matter also consists of the neuroglia which surrounds the nerve  cells and fibers, and a network of blood vessels. The \"white matter\" of  the central system consists chiefly of axons with their enveloping or  medullary, sheath and neuroglia. The white matter contains no nerve  cells or dendrites. The difference in color of the gray and the white  matter is caused chiefly by the fact that in the gray masses the  medullary sheath, which is white, is lacking, thus revealing the ashen  gray of the nerve threads. In the white masses the medullary sheath is  present.      4. GROSS STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM    DIVISIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--The nervous system may be considered  in two divisions: (1) The _central_ system, which consists of the brain  and spinal cord, and (2) the _peripheral_ system, which comprises the  sensory and motor neurones connecting the periphery and the internal  organs with the central system and the specialized end-organs of the  senses. The _sympathetic_ system, which is found as a double chain of  nerve connections joining the roots of sensory and motor nerves just  outside the spinal column, does not seem to be directly related to  consciousness and so will not be discussed here. A brief description of  the nervous system will help us better to understand how its parts all  work together in so wonderful a way to accomplish their great result.    THE CENTRAL SYSTEM.--In the brain we easily distinguish three major  divisions--the _cerebrum_, the _cerebellum_ and the _medulla oblongata_.  The medulla is but the enlarged upper part of the cord where it connects  with the brain. It is about an inch and a quarter long, and is composed  of both medullated and unmedullated fibers--that is of both \"white\" and  \"gray\" matter. In the medulla, the unmedullated neurones which comprise  the center of the cord are passing to the outside, and the medullated to  the inside, thus taking the positions they occupy in the cerebrum. Here  also the neurones are crossing, or changing sides, so that those which  pass up the right side of the cord finally connect with the left side of  the brain, and vice versa.    THE CEREBELLUM.--Lying just back of the medulla and at the rear part of  the base of the cerebrum is the cerebellum, or \"little brain,\"  approximately as large as the fist, and composed of a complex  arrangement of white and gray matter. Fibers from the spinal cord enter  this mass, and others emerge and pass on into the cerebrum, while its  two halves also are connected with each other by means of cross fibers.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--View of the under side of the brain. B, basis of  the crura; P, pons; Mo, medulla oblongata; Ce, cerebellum; Sc, spinal  cord.]    THE CEREBRUM.--The cerebrum occupies all the upper part of the skull  from the front to the rear. It is divided symmetrically into two  hemispheres, the right and the left. These hemispheres are connected  with each other by a small bridge of fibers called the _corpus  callosum_. Each hemisphere is furrowed and ridged with convolutions, an  arrangement which allows greater surface for the distribution of the  gray cellular matter over it. Besides these irregularities of surface,  each hemisphere is marked also by two deep clefts or _fissures_--the  fissure of Rolando, extending from the middle upper part of the  hemisphere downward and forward, passing a little in front of the ear  and stopping on a level with the upper part of it; and the fissure of  Sylvius, beginning at the base of the brain somewhat in front of the  ear and extending upward and backward at an acute angle with the base  of the hemisphere.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diagrammatic side view of brain, showing  cerebellum (CB) and medulla oblongata (MO). F' F'' F''' are placed on  the first, second, and third frontal convolutions, respectively; AF, on  the ascending frontal; AP, on the ascending parietal; M, on the  marginal; A, on the angular. T' T'' T''' are placed on the first,  second, and third temporal convolutions. R-R marks the fissure of  Rolando; S-S, the fissure of Sylvius; PO, the parieto-occipital  fissure.]    The surface of each hemisphere may be thought of as mapped out into four  lobes: The frontal lobe, which includes the front part of the hemisphere  and extends back to the fissure of Rolando and down to the fissure of  Sylvius; the parietal lobe, which lies back of the fissure of Rolando  and above that of Sylvius and extends back to the occipital lobe; the  occipital lobe, which includes the extreme rear portion of the  hemisphere; and the temporal lobe, which lies below the fissure of  Sylvius and extends back to the occipital lobe.    THE CORTEX.--The gray matter of the hemispheres, unlike that of the  cord, lies on the surface. This gray exterior portion of the cerebrum is  called the _cortex_, and varies from one-twelfth to one-eighth of an  inch in thickness. The cortex is the seat of all consciousness and "]]]
