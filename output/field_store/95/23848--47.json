Now perhaps this was indiscreet, but, after all, what harm could it  do?    It was a certain comfort to them, and there could be no objection to  their taking a public stand for their own, under British martial law.  At least, _we_ thought so. Not so the enemy!    About three weeks after the British entry into the capital, the van  Warmelos were told that orders had been issued that no Transvaal  burgher in Pretoria would in future be permitted to wear the  \"Vierkleur.\"    \"Impossible! I do not believe it,\" Hansie exclaimed.    \"What are you going to do?\" her mother inquired.    \"Go out as usual with my 'Vierkleur' on, and see what happens,\" she  said.    She went out and nothing happened, so she went out again next day, and  the next.    In the meantime she heard that dozens of women and girls had been  stopped in the streets and marched off to the various Charge Offices,  where their colours were forcibly removed and detained as contraband  articles of war.    Her mother warned her not to run the risk of losing her precious  ribbon, and advised her to put it away, but Hansie was determined to  wear it until _compelled_ to submit. For a few days she rode about as  usual, accompanied by Carlo, without being molested in any way, and  she was just beginning to feel reassured, when, one day, a petty  officer rode up to her in the street and ordered her to take off her  Transvaal colours. She was on her way to Consul Cinatti's house, and  was walking, for the Portuguese Consulate was quite close to Harmony.    With the horse prancing before her, she could not very well proceed on  her way. She stopped and looked up at the soldier. She did not like  his face at all, and changed her mind about what she meant to say to  him.    \"Why don't you do as I tell you? Take off that ribbon at once,\" he  commanded.    \"Why don't you go and conquer the Transvaal?\" she asked.    \"I have my orders,\" he said, with a black look, \"and if you don't  remove those colours from your hat immediately, I shall send some one  to take them off by force.\"    \"Take the Transvaal first,\" she said persuasively, \"then you will be  quite welcome to my bit of ribbon.\"    He wheeled round suddenly and tore off to the Sunnyside Charge Office,  lashing his poor horse savagely and looking round at her with a  watchful eye every few yards.    Hansie walked faster, and had nearly reached the side gate of the  Consulate, when she saw him returning with two other mounted soldiers.    She dived through the gate, and running through the garden,  unceremoniously entered the house at a side door.    \"Oh, Celeste!\" she said to the astonished Miss Cinatti, \"there are  three men after me!\"    \"Three men after you! What do you mean?\"    \"They want my precious 'Vierkleur.' What shall I do?\"    \"Take it off!\"    \"Never!\"    Here they were joined by Mr. Cinatti, who waved his arms and stamped  his feet when he heard the story, and got so excited and indignant  that he spluttered even more than usual in his broken English.    \"What meant it all? What impudent impertinence was dis? It was nothing  but one big mean trick, a prying trap,\" etc., etc.    When the storm was over (and his storms were usually of brief  duration) he asked Hansie, with a gesture of comical despair:    \"What are we going to do now?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Will you take off dat ribbon?\"    \"I will not.\"    Hugely delighted, he clasped his hands in well-assumed agony of mind.    \"Stay here and go home in de dark?\"    \"No,\" Hansie laughed.    \"I'll tell you. Celeste will give you anudder ribbon to put over dat  one.\"    \"Thank you very much,\" Hansie said. \"Yes, that is a good idea.\"    Miss Cinatti fastened a broad white ribbon over the \"Vierkleur,\" and  Hansie bade her an affectionate farewell. The Consul escorted her to  the gate, where they found one of the mounted soldiers guarding the  entrance, while the second had been stationed at the side gate into  which Hansie had been seen to disappear. The man who had addressed her  first was nowhere to be seen. Mr. Cinatti glared at the soldier, who  backed away from the entrance, and allowed the girl to pass. He did  not look triumphant--on the contrary he saluted respectfully; but the  other Tommy at the side gate laughed when he saw the white ribbon on  her hat, and I am afraid that Hansie felt very much inclined to say,  \"I've got my 'Vierkleur' on still!\" But she wisely refrained, walking  on stiffly without so much as a glance at the man. That night she  slowly and sadly took off her 'bit of ribbon gay,' replacing it by a  black band in token of mourning and bereavement.    There was too much at stake, and she felt it would be better to keep  the ribbon in safety at home than to run the risk of being deprived of  it by force.    A sympathetic friend afterwards painted two crossed flags, the flags  of the Transvaal and the Free State, on her band of black, and this  she wore unmolested until the end of the war.          CHAPTER VI    PASSES AND PERMITS      At this time the procuring of passes and permits became the order of  the day, and it is inconceivable the amount of red-tape that had to be  gone through in the process.    For women living alone and having no menfolk to send to the offices,  this was especially annoying.    Hours were spent in waiting, and applicants were frequently sent from  one official to another, and from one department to another, on  unimportant matters.    This brought Hansie into touch with the very men whose society she had  resolved to avoid.    It took her three or four hours to get a permit for her bicycle and as  many days to get permission to retain her Colt's pocket-pistol, for  the officers in charge of the rifle department refused to let her keep  it and she eventually decided to go straight to head-quarters, viz.  the Military Governor, General Maxwell.    Orders had very rightly been issued that all firearms should be  delivered to the military authorities, but in this case Mrs. van  Warmelo thought an exception should be made, because two unprotected  women, living in an isolated homestead, could hardly be considered  safe in times of such great danger unless sufficiently armed and able  to defend themselves.    Other matters, of minor importance, could be overlooked, but it was to  this question of retaining weapons that she and her daughter owed  their acquaintance with the charming and affable Military Governor.    The two women were received with great courtesy, and when they had  explained that they had a Mauser rifle in their possession, a  revolver, and a pistol, begging to be allowed to keep them for  self-defence, General Maxwell instantly granted them permits for the  revolver and pistol, but asked them to give up their rifle. He gave  them a written promise, signed by himself, that the rifle would be  returned to them after the war--which promise, I may add, was  faithfully kept. General Maxwell asked many questions about their  fighting relatives, and, when they were departing, said he hoped they  would come straight to him if at any time they got into trouble.    This kindness opened the way to many subsequent visits, and brought  about a friendly understanding between the officials in the Governor's  Department and Mrs. and Miss van Warmelo.    The latter, upon whom naturally devolved the task of procuring the  necessary passes and permits, was always well received, and never kept  waiting, although she made no secret of her feelings towards the  British, and frankly gave vent to her opinions on every subject  connected with the war. This state of affairs was brought about all  the more easily by the fact that General Maxwell and his A.D.C., Major  Hoskins, invited her opinions on every possible occasion.    Mutual respect, and a sincere desire to alleviate the suffering caused  by the war, formed the basis of the somewhat incongruous friendship  between the high British official and the Republican girl, especially  as time went on and the appalling problem of the concentration camps  presented itself. Then it was that General Maxwell, pacing up and down  in his office, his brow drawn with care, and every movement betraying  his distress, frankly discussed the situation with Hansie and invited  her confidence. As she had no secrets of importance at this time,  these interviews were marked by a spirit of mutual understanding, and  she learnt more and more to admire and respect the Governor for his  humanity and nobility of character; but the time was soon to come when  the demands of her land and people called her to more dangerous fields  of labour, and then it became difficult, well-nigh impossible, to meet  the searching eye of the Military Governor.    Her visits became less frequent, of her own free will, and in time  ceased altogether.    Soon after the rifle incident Hansie had to call on General Maxwell,  as Secretary of the Pretoria Ladies' Vocal Society, for a permit to  hold rehearsals. She found him alone and disengaged, for a wonder, and  so evidently pleased to see her again that she entered into  conversation with him unhesitatingly.    After she had explained the object of her visit and apologised for  troubling him about such a trifle, she told him that she had been  informed in other Departments that as there was no institution for  granting permits to hold rehearsals, she would have to get a special  permit from the Military Governor.    \"Why,\" he exclaimed in surprise, \"can you not rehearse without a  permit?\"    \"No,\" Hansie answered laughingly. \"Do you not know that two or three  may not gather together except in the name of the Governor under the  new regulations and since the execution of Cordua? Why, we may be  conspiring against your life instead of rehearsing our songs, and at  the present moment we can hardly put our noses out-of-doors without  being asked whether we have permits for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#8)"],[1,"on the back of his head.      BRUSHES    Japanese printing brushes are sold by some artists' colour dealers, but  these are not essential, nor have they any practical superiority over  well-made Western brushes.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Drawing of brushes.]    An excellent type of brush is that made of black Siberian bear hair for  fine varnishing. These can be had from good brush-makers with the hair  fixed so that it will stand soaking in water. Drawings of the type of  brush are given above.    Three or four are sufficient; one broad brush, about three inches, for  large spaces, one two-inch, and two one-inch, will do nearly all that is  needed. Occasionally a smaller brush may be of use.      PRINTING    To begin printing, one takes first the key-block, laying it upon a wet  sheet of unsized paper, or upon wads of wet paper under each corner of  the block, which will keep it quite steady on the work-table. A batch  of sheets of printing paper, prepared and damped as described in Chapter  V, lies between boards just beyond the block. The pad lies close to the  block at the right on oily paper pinned to the table. To the right also  are a dish or plate on which a little ink is spread, the printing brush  (broad for the key-block), a saucer containing fresh paste, a bowl of  water, a small sponge, and a cloth. Nothing else is needed, and it is  best to keep the table clear of unnecessary pots or colour bottles.    When these things are ready one should see that the paper is in a good  state. It should be rather drier for a key-block than for other blocks,  as a fine line will print thickly if the paper is too damp and soft. In  fact, it can scarcely be too dry for the key-block, provided that it has  become perfectly smooth, and is still flexible enough for complete  contact with the block. But it must not be either dry or damp in  patches.    If the paper is all right, one lifts off the upper board and top damping  sheet, placing them on the left, ready to receive the sheets when  printed.    The key-block, if quite dry, must be moistened with a damp sponge and  then brushed over with the broad printing brush and ink. If a grey line  is wanted the brush should be dipped in a little of the paste and  scarcely touched with ink. For a pale grey line the key-block also must  be well washed before printing. Even if the line is to be black a little  paste should be used. This is best added after one has brushed the black  ink on to the block, not mixed with it beforehand. The ink and paste  are then broken together smoothly and completely over the whole surface  of the block. The last few brush strokes should be of the full length or  breadth of the block and be given lightly with the brush held upright.  The inking of the block must be thoroughly done, but with no more  brushing than is necessary to spread the colour equally. When properly  charged with ink the block should not be at all wet, but just covered  with a very thin and nearly dry film of ink and paste.    No time should be wasted in lifting the top sheet of printing paper on  to the block, placing first its right corner in the register notch, and  holding it there with the thumb, then the edge of the paper to the other  notch, to be held with the left thumb while the right hand is released  to take up the baren (fig. 21). Beginning at the left, the baren is  rubbed backwards and forwards, a full stroke each time, to the outside  limits of the block, with a moderate, even pressure, moving the stroke  in a zigzag towards the right end of the block (fig. 22). Once over  should be enough. A second rub makes heavy printing of the finer lines.  Then the paper is lifted from the block and placed on the board to the  left.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Manner of holding the paper.]    Particular attention must be given to the careful placing of the paper  home in the register notches, and to holding it there until the rubber  has gripped the paper on the block.    Sheet by sheet all the printing paper is passed in this way over the  key-block, and piled together. There is no fear of the ink offsetting or  marking the print placed above it. As the work proceeds the block will  give better and better impressions. Spoiled or defective impressions  should be put together at the top of the pile when it lies ready for the  next printing, for the first few impressions are always uncertain, and  it is well to use the defective prints as pioneers, so as not to spoil  good ones.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Manner of using the baren.]    When the block has been printed on the whole batch, the sheets should  be replaced at once between the boards before one prepares for the  colour impressions. Usually the paper will be too dry for colour by this  time: if this is so, the damping sheets should be moistened and put in  again as before; one to each three printing sheets. In a minute or two  they will have damped the paper sufficiently and must be taken out,  leaving the printing sheets to stand, between the boards, ready for the  first colour-block.      PRINTING FROM COLOUR-BLOCKS    In printing colour the paper may be slightly damper than it should be  for key-block impressions, and a heavier pressure is necessary on the  baren if the colour masses are large. If the baren is pressed lightly  the colour will not completely cover the paper, but will leave a dry,  granular texture. Occasionally this quality may be useful, but as a rule  a smooth, evenly printed surface is best. It will be found that smooth,  even printing is not obtained by loading the block with colour or paste,  but by using the least possible quantity of both, and nearly dry paper.    In beginning to print from a colour-block, care should be taken to  moisten the block fully before printing, or it will not yield the colour  from its surface; but the block must be wiped, and not used while  actually wet.    The printing proceeds exactly as in the case of the key-block, except  for the heavier use of the baren. The paste should be added after the  colour has been roughly brushed on to the block, and then the two are  smoothly brushed together. The Japanese printers put the paste on to the  block by means of a little stick kept in the dish of paste. Experience  will soon show the amount of paste needed. It is important neither to  add too much nor to stint the paste, as the colour when dry depends on  the paste for its quality. Too little paste gives a dead effect.    Some of the colours print more easily than others. With a sticky colour  it is well to wipe the block with a nearly dry sponge between each  impression, so that the wood gives up its colour more readily. In the  case of a very heavy colour such as vermilion a drop of glue and water  may help; but with practically all the colours that are generally used  the rice paste and careful printing are enough.    The amount of size in the paper is another important factor in the  printing of colour. If the paper is too lightly sized the fibres will  detach themselves and stick to the damp block. Or if too heavily sized  the paper will not take up the colour cleanly from the block, and will  look hard when dry. One very soon feels instinctively the right quality  and condition of the block, colour, and paper which are essential to  good printing; and to print well one must become sensitive to them.      PRINTING OF GRADATIONS    Beside the printing of flat masses of colour, one of the great resources  of block printing is in the power of delicate gradation in printing.  The simplest way of making a gradation from strong to pale colour is to  dip one corner of a broad brush into the colour and the other corner  into water so that the water just runs into the colour: then, by  squeezing the whole width of the brush broadly between the thumb and  forefinger so that most of the water is squeezed out, the brush is left  charged with a tint gradated from side to side. The brush is then dipped  lightly into paste along its whole edge, and brushed a few times to and  fro across the block where the gradation is needed. It is easy in this  way to print a very delicately gradated tint from full colour to white.  If the pale edge of the tint is to disappear, the block should be  moistened along the surface with a sponge where the colour is to cease.    A soft edge may be given to a tint with a brush ordinarily charged if  the block is moistened with a clean sponge at the part where the tint is  to cease. This effect is often seen at the top of the sky in a Japanese  landscape print where a dark blue band of colour is printed with a soft  edge suddenly gradated to white, or sometimes the plumage of birds is  printed with sudden gradations. In fact, the method may be developed in  all kinds of ways. Often it is an advantage to print a gradation and  then a flat tone over the gradation in a second printing.      OFFSETTING    No care need be taken to prevent \"offsetting\" of the colour while  printing. The prints may be piled on the top of each other immediately  as they are lifted from the block, without fear of offsetting or marking  each other. Only an excessive use of colour, or the leaving of heavy  ridges of colour at the edges of the block by careless brushing, will  sometimes mark the next print on the pile. As in printing the key-block,  it is well to hold the brush quite upright for the last strokes across  the block, and always to give a full stroke across the whole length or  width of the form to be coloured.    As soon as one colour-block has been printed, the next may be taken and  printed at once, without fear of the colour running, even though the  fresh colour touches the parts already printed.    One by one each colour-block is printed in this way until the batch of  paper has been passed over the whole set of blocks composing the design  of the print. There may sometimes be an advantage in not printing the  key-block first, though as a rule it"]]]
