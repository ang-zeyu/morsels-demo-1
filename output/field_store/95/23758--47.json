Los terrenos, en la proporcion que ofrece el rio,  valiendose del arte, á poca costa se pueden beneficiar con el riego,  como tengo demostrado al Señor Virey en oficio de 26 de Marzo del año  próximo anterior, número 26; y aun sin los medios que allí propongo, si  los vecinos son aplicados, con norias que meuvan caballos pueden  adelantar mucho; mayormente cuando allí no tienen costo, y es muy poco  lo que cuesta este ganado.    Todo lo cual parece haber persuadido que los conatos y desvelos de  nuestros católicos monarcas en proyectar y promover estos  establecimientos, han sido efectos de un profundo conocimiento y estudio  sobre la religion y la política; que estas dos bases de todo Gobierno  ilustrado y cristiano, fueron el fundamento de las expediciones de  Sarmiento. Las de los dos hermanos Nodales, la del capitan Olivares, con  los Padres Cardiel, Quiroga y Strobl; la del capital de fragata D.  Francisco Pando; la de D. Domingo Perlier, y ultimamente las que han  salido de Montevideo y Buenos Aires, para las comisiones que se nos han  confiado á los dos hermanos; que á pesar de todos los émulos que las  quieren contradecir, siempre serán útiles estos establecimientos, por el  fomento del comercio que proporcionan en la pesca de la ballena, en la  conduccion de sal á Buenas Aires, y salida de las carnes de los ganados  que crian sus inmensas campañas; por facilitar puerto para hacer mas  suave la navegacion y comercio á la mar del sur, por cerrar y defender  la puerta á nuestros enemigos, asegurando lo interior del reyno; por los  progresos de la extension de sus poblaciones, porque ellas serán la  mejor trinchera que contendrá á los indios salvajes, que á manera de un  torrente impetuoso cada dia inundan estos campos, llevándose tras sí  innumerable ganado caballar y vacuno, asolando las tristes habitaciones  de los vecinos fronterizos á esta capital, haciendo que los caminos no  sean seguros, y víctima de su furor á muchos desgraciados, que perecen  inhumanamente cada dia á sus manos, de un modo horrible y espantoso. Y  finalmente podrá conseguirse la mayor de las utilidades, que consiste en  hacer hombres, y hombres cristianos á este gran número de salvajes.  Utilidades que pueden conciliarse sin el dispendio del real erario, y  que son las que me propuse describir en las tres partes de esta memoria,  en la cual si hubiese alguna expresion menos digna, debe ser atribuida  al ardiente celo con que miro estos establecimientos, pues mi ánimo  jamas ha sido zaherir con mis expresiones á persona alguna. Todas ellas  las sugeto á la superior correccion de V. E.; lisonjeándome, que  atendiendo al buen fin con que estan dictadas, ha de disimular cualquier  defecto que se encuentre. Sí, Señor Exmo., ¿como podré yo dudar que en  el ánimo V. E., tengan benigna acogida unos pensamientos dirigidos á la  prosperidad del Estado, y al aumento de la religion? V. E., que pesa  todas las cosas en la balanza del saber, alcanza mejor que yo, qué  materia se le propone para emplear toda la actividad de su celo hácia el  real servicio. Ella puede hacer una gloriosa época en los tiempos  felices del mando de V. E., quien como siempre hará lo mejor.--Buenos  Aires, 1.º de Mayo de 1784.

There is something.\"    \"Carley, a man who has been on the verge--as I have been--seldom or  never comes back to happiness. But perhaps--\"    \"You frighten me,\" cried Carley, and, rising, she sat upon the arm of  his chair and encircled his neck with her arms. \"How can I help if I do  not understand? Am I so miserably little?... Glenn, must I tell you? No  woman can live without love. I need to be loved. That's all that's wrong  with me.\"    \"Carley, you are still an imperious, mushy girl,\" replied Glenn, taking  her into his arms. \"I need to be loved, too. But that's not what is  wrong with me. You'll have to find it out yourself.\"    \"You're a dear old Sphinx,\" she retorted.    \"Listen, Carley,\" he said, earnestly. \"About this love-making stuff.  Please don't misunderstand me. I love you. I'm starved for your kisses.  But--is it right to ask them?\"    \"Right! Aren't we engaged? And don't I want to give them?\"    \"If I were only sure we'd be married!\" he said, in low, tense voice, as  if speaking more to himself.    \"Married!\" cried Carley, convulsively clasping him. \"Of course we'll be  married. Glenn, you wouldn't jilt me?\"    \"Carley, what I mean is that you might never really marry me,\" he  answered, seriously.    \"Oh, if that's all you need be sure of, Glenn Kilbourne, you may begin  to make love to me now.\"      It was late when Carley went up to her room. And she was in such a  softened mood, so happy and excited and yet disturbed in mind, that the  coldness and the darkness did not matter in the least. She undressed  in pitchy blackness, stumbling over chair and bed, feeling for what she  needed. And in her mood this unusual proceeding was fun. When ready for  bed she opened the door to take a peep out. Through the dense blackness  the waterfall showed dimly opaque. Carley felt a soft mist wet her face.  The low roar of the falling water seemed to envelop her. Under the cliff  wall brooded impenetrable gloom. But out above the treetops shone great  stars, wonderfully white and radiant and cold, with a piercing contrast  to the deep clear blue of sky. The waterfall hummed into an absolutely  dead silence. It emphasized the silence. Not only cold was it that made  Carley shudder. How lonely, how lost, how hidden this canyon!    Then she hurried to bed, grateful for the warm woolly blankets.  Relaxation and thought brought consciousness of the heat of her blood,  the beat and throb and swell of her heart, of the tumult within her. In  the lonely darkness of her room she might have faced the truth of her  strangely renewed and augmented love for Glenn Kilbourne. But she was  more concerned with her happiness. She had won him back. Her presence,  her love had overcome his restraint. She thrilled in the sweet  consciousness of her woman's conquest. How splendid he was! To hold  back physical tenderness, the simple expressions of love, because he had  feared they might unduly influence her! He had grown in many ways.  She must be careful to reach up to his ideals. That about Flo Hutter's  toil-hardened hands! Was that significance somehow connected with  the rift in the lute? For Carley admitted to herself that there was  something amiss, something incomprehensible, something intangible that  obtruded its menace into her dream of future happiness. Still, what had  she to fear, so long as she could be with Glenn?    And yet there were forced upon her, insistent and perplexing, the  questions--was her love selfish? was she considering him? was she blind  to something he could see? Tomorrow and next day and the days to come  held promise of joyous companionship with Glenn, yet likewise they  seemed full of a portent of trouble for her, or fight and ordeal, of  lessons that would make life significant for her.        CHAPTER III    Carley was awakened by rattling sounds in her room. The raising of  sleepy eyelids disclosed Flo on her knees before the little stove, in  the act of lighting a fire.    \"Mawnin', Carley,\" she drawled. \"It's shore cold. Reckon it'll snow  today, worse luck, just because you're here. Take my hunch and stay in  bed till the fire burns up.\"    \"I shall do no such thing,\" declared Carley, heroically.    \"We're afraid you'll take cold,\" said Flo. \"This is desert country with  high altitude. Spring is here when the sun shines. But it's only shinin'  in streaks these days. That means winter, really. Please be good.\"    \"Well, it doesn't require much self-denial to stay here awhile longer,\"  replied Carley, lazily.    Flo left with a parting admonition not to let the stove get red-hot. And  Carley lay snuggled in the warm blankets, dreading the ordeal of getting  out into that cold bare room. Her nose was cold. When her nose grew  cold, it being a faithful barometer as to temperature, Carley knew there  was frost in the air. She preferred summer. Steam-heated rooms with  hothouse flowers lending their perfume had certainly not trained Carley  for primitive conditions. She had a spirit, however, that was waxing  a little rebellious to all this intimation as to her susceptibility to  colds and her probable weakness under privation. Carley got up. Her  bare feet landed upon the board floor instead of the Navajo rug, and  she thought she had encountered cold stone. Stove and hot water  notwithstanding, by the time she was half dressed she was also half  frozen. \"Some actor fellow once said w-when you w-went West you were  c-camping out,\" chattered Carley. \"Believe me, he said something.\"    The fact was Carley had never camped out. Her set played golf, rode  horseback, motored and house-boated, but they had never gone in for  uncomfortable trips. The camps and hotels in the Adirondacks were as  warm and luxurious as Carley's own home. Carley now missed many things.  And assuredly her flesh was weak. It cost her effort of will and real  pain to finish lacing her boots. As she had made an engagement with  Glenn to visit his cabin, she had donned an outdoor suit. She wondered  if the cold had anything to do with the perceptible diminishing of the  sound of the waterfall. Perhaps some of the water had frozen, like her  fingers.    Carley went downstairs to the living room, and made no effort to resist  a rush to the open fire. Flo and her mother were amused at Carley's  impetuosity. \"You'll like that stingin' of the air after you get used  to it,\" said Mrs. Hutter. Carley had her doubts. When she was thoroughly  thawed out she discovered an appetite quite unusual for her, and she  enjoyed her breakfast. Then it was time to sally forth to meet Glenn.    \"It's pretty sharp this mawnin',\" said Flo. \"You'll need gloves and  sweater.\"    Having fortified herself with these, Carley asked how to find West Fork  Canyon.    \"It's down the road a little way,\" replied Flo. \"A great narrow canyon  opening on the right side. You can't miss it.\"    Flo accompanied her as far as the porch steps. A queer-looking  individual was slouching along with ax over his shoulder.    \"There's Charley,\" said Flo. \"He'll show you.\" Then she whispered:  \"He's sort of dotty sometimes. A horse kicked him once. But mostly he's  sensible.\"    At Flo's call the fellow halted with a grin. He was long, lean, loose  jointed, dressed in blue overalls stuck into the tops of muddy boots,  and his face was clear olive without beard or line. His brow bulged a  little, and from under it peered out a pair of wistful brown eyes that  reminded Carley of those of a dog she had once owned.    \"Wal, it ain't a-goin' to be a nice day,\" remarked Charley, as he tried  to accommodate his strides to Carley's steps.    \"How can you tell?\" asked Carley. \"It looks clear and bright.\"    \"Naw, this is a dark mawnin'. Thet's a cloudy sun. We'll hev snow on an'  off.\"    \"Do you mind bad weather?\"    \"Me? All the same to me. Reckon, though, I like it cold so I can loaf  round a big fire at night.\"    \"I like a big fire, too.\"    \"Ever camped out?\" he asked.    \"Not what you'd call the real thing,\" replied Carley.    \"Wal, thet's too bad. Reckon it'll be tough fer you,\" he went on,  kindly. \"There was a gurl tenderfoot heah two years ago an' she had a  hell of a time. They all joked her, 'cept me, an' played tricks on her.  An' on her side she was always puttin' her foot in it. I was shore sorry  fer her.\"    \"You were very kind to be an exception,\" murmured Carley.    \"You look out fer Tom Hutter, an' I reckon Flo ain't so darn above  layin' traps fer you. 'Specially as she's sweet on your beau. I seen  them together a lot.\"    \"Yes?\" interrogated Carley, encouragingly.    \"Kilbourne is the best fellar thet ever happened along Oak Creek. I  helped him build his cabin. We've hunted some together. Did you ever  hunt?\"    \"No.\"    \"Wal, you've shore missed a lot of fun,\" he said. \"Turkey huntin'.  Thet's what fetches the gurls. I reckon because turkeys are so good to  eat. The old gobblers hev begun to gobble now. I'll take you gobbler  huntin' if you'd like to go.\"    \"I'm sure I would.\"    \"There's good trout fishin' along heah a little later,\" he said,  pointing to the stream. \"Crick's too high now. I like West Fork best.  I've ketched some lammin' big ones up there.\"    Carley was amused and interested. She could not say that Charley  had shown any indication of his mental peculiarity to her. It took  considerable restraint not to lead him to talk more about Flo and Glenn.  Presently they reached the turn in the road, opposite the cottage Carley  had noticed yesterday, and here her loquacious escort halted.    \"You take the trail heah,\" he said, pointing it out, \"an' foller it into  West Fork. So long, an' don't forget we're goin' huntin' turkeys.\"    Carley smiled her thanks, and, taking"]]]
