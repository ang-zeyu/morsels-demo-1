And afterwards the said Brayne took the       matter of the said building so upon him as he was driven to       borrow money to supply the same, saying to this deponent       that his brother Burbage was not able to help the same, and       that he found not towards it above the value of fifty       pounds, some part in mony and the rest in stuff.[52]    [Footnote 52: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 136.]    In reading the next deposition, one should bear in mind the fact that  the deponent, Robert Myles, was closely identified with the Brayne  faction, and was, therefore, a bitter enemy to the Burbages. Yet his  testimony, though prejudiced, gives us a vivid picture of Brayne's  activity in the building of the Theatre:         So the said John Brayne made a great sum of money of purpose       and intent to go to the building of the said playhouse, and       thereupon did provide timber and other stuff needful for the       building thereof, and hired carpenters and plasterers for       the same purpose, and paid the workmen continually. So as he       for his part laid out of his own purse and what upon credit       about the same to the sum of L600 or L700 at the least. And       in the same time, seeing the said James Burbage nothing able       either of himself or by his credit to contribute any like       sum towards the building thereof, being then to be finished       or else to be lost that had been bestowed upon it already,       the said Brayne was driven to sell his house he dwelled in       in Bucklersbury, and all his stock that was left, and give       up his trade, yea in the end to pawn and sell both his own       garments and his wife's, and to run in debt to many for       money, to finish the said playhouse, and so to employ       himself only upon that matter, and all whatsoever he could       make, to his utter undoing, for he saieth that in the latter       end of the finishing thereof, the said Brayne and his wife,       the now complainants, were driven to labor in the said work       for saving of some of the charge in place of two laborers,       whereas the said James Burbage went about his own business,       and at sometimes when he did take upon him to do some thing       in the said work, he would be and was allowed a workman's       hire as other the workman there had.[53]    [Footnote 53: Brayne _v._ Burbage, 1592. Printed in full by Wallace,  _op cit._ p. 141.]    The last fling at Burbage is quite gratuitous; yet it is probably true  that the main costs of erecting the playhouse fell upon the shoulders  of Brayne. The evidence is contradictory; some persons assert that  Burbage paid half the cost of the building,[54] others that Brayne  paid nearly all,[55] and still others content themselves with saying  that Brayne paid considerably more than half. The last statement may  be accepted as true. The assertion of Gyles Alleyn in 1601, that the  Theatre was \"erected at the costs and charges of one Brayne and not of  the said James Burbage, to the value of one thousand marks,\"[56] is  doubtless incorrect; more correct is the assertion of Robert Myles,  executor of the Widow Brayne's will, in 1597: \"The said John Brayne  did join with the said James [Burbage] in the building aforesaid, and  did expend thereupon greater sums than the said James, that is to say,  at least five or six hundred pounds.\"[57] Since there is evidence  that the playhouse ultimately cost about L700,[58] we might hazard the  guess that of this sum Brayne furnished about L500,[59] and Burbage  about L200. To equalize the expenditure it was later agreed that \"the  said Brayne should take and receive all the rents and profits of the  said Theatre to his own use until he should be answered such sums of  money which he had laid out for and upon the same Theatre more than  the said Burbage had done.\"[60]    [Footnote 54: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 213, 217, 263, 265, _et al._]    [Footnote 55: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 137, 141, 142, 148, 153.]    [Footnote 56: Alleyn _v._ Burbage, Star Chamber Proceedings, 1601-02;  printed by Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 277.]    [Footnote 57: Myles _v._ Burbage and Alleyn, 1597; printed by Wallace,  _op. cit._, p. 159; cf. pp. 263, 106, 152.]    [Footnote 58: See Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 277.]    [Footnote 59: This agrees with the claim of Brayne's widow.]    [Footnote 60: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 120.]    But if Burbage at the outset was \"nothing able to contribute any\"  great sum of ready money towards the building of the first playhouse,  he did contribute other things equally if not more important. In the  first place, he conceived the idea, and he carried it as far towards  realization as his means allowed. In the second place, he planned the  building--its stage as well as its auditorium--to meet the special  demands of the actors and the comfort of the audience. This called for  bold originality and for ingenuity of a high order, for, it must be  remembered, he had no model to study--he was designing the first  structure of its kind in England.[61] For this task he was well  prepared. In the first place, he was an actor of experience; in the  second place, he was the manager of one of the most important troupes  in England; and, in the third place, he was by training and early  practice a carpenter and builder. In other words, he had exact  knowledge of what was needed, and the practical skill to meet those  needs.    [Footnote 61: Mr. E.K. Chambers (_The Mediaeval Stage_, I, 383, note 2;  II, 190, note 4) calls attention to a \"theatre\" belonging to the city  of Essex as early as 1548. Possibly the Latin document he cites  referred to an amphitheatre of some sort near the city which was used  for dramatic performances; at any rate \"in theatro\" does not  necessarily imply the existence of a playhouse (cf., for example, _op.  cit._, I, 81-82). There is also a reference (quoted by Chambers, _op.  cit._, II, 191, note 1, from _Norfolk Archaeology_, XI, 336) to a  \"game-house\" built by the corporation of Yarmouth in 1538 for dramatic  performances. What kind of house this was we do not know, but the  corporation leased it for other purposes, with the proviso that it  should be available \"at all such times as any interludes or plays  should be ministered or played.\" Howes, in his continuation of Stow's  _Annals_ (1631), p. 1004, declares that before Burbage's time he  \"neither knew, heard, nor read of any such theatres, set stages, or  playhouses as have been purposely built, within man's memory\"; and  Cuthbert Burbage confidently asserted that his father \"was the first  builder of playhouses\"--an assertion which, I think, cannot well be  denied.]    The building that he designed and erected he named--as by virtue of  priority he had a right to do--\"The Theatre.\"    Of the Theatre, unfortunately, we have no pictorial representation,  and no formal description, so that our knowledge of its size, shape,  and general arrangement must be derived from scattered and  miscellaneous sources. That the building was large we may feel sure;  the cost of its erection indicates as much. The Fortune, one of the  largest and handsomest of the later playhouses, cost only L520, and  the Hope, also very large, cost L360. The Theatre, therefore, built at  a cost of L700, could not have been small. It is commonly referred to,  even so late as 1601, as \"the great house called the Theatre,\" and the  author of _Skialetheia_ (1598) applied to it the significant adjective  \"vast.\" Burbage, no doubt, had learned from his experience as manager  of a troupe the pecuniary advantage of having an auditorium large  enough to receive all who might come. Exactly how many people his  building could accommodate we cannot say. The Reverend John Stockwood,  in 1578, exclaims bitterly: \"Will not a filthy play, with the blast of  a trumpet, sooner call thither a thousand than an hour's tolling of  the bell bring to the sermon a hundred?\"[62] And Fleetwood, the City  Recorder, in describing a quarrel which took place in 1584 \"at Theatre  door,\" states that \"near a thousand people\" quickly assembled when the  quarrel began.    [Footnote 62: The rest of his speech indicates that he had the Theatre  in mind. The passage, of course, is rhetorical.]    In shape the building was probably polygonal, or circular. I see no  good reason for supposing that it was square; Johannes de Witt  referred to it as an \"amphitheatre,\" and the Curtain, erected the  following year in imitation, was probably polygonal.[63] It was built  of timber, and its exterior, no doubt, was--as in the case of  subsequent playhouses--of lime and plaster. The interior consisted of  three galleries surrounding an open space called the \"yard.\" The  German traveler, Samuel Kiechel, who visited London in the autumn of  1585, described the playhouses--i.e., the Theatre and the Curtain--as  \"singular [_sonderbare_] houses, which are so constructed that they  have about three galleries, one above the other.\"[64] And Stephen  Gosson, in _Plays Confuted_ (_c._ 1581) writes: \"In the playhouses at  London, it is the fashion for youths to go first into the yard, and to  carry their eye through every gallery; then, like unto ravens, where  they spy the carrion, thither they fly, and press as near to the  fairest as they can.\" The \"yard\" was unroofed, and all persons there  had to stand during the entire performance. The galleries, however,  were protected by a roof, were divided into \"rooms,\" and were provided  for the most part with seats. Gyles Alleyn inserted in the lease he  granted to Burbage the following condition:         And further, that it shall or may [be] lawful for the said       Gyles and for his wife and family, upon lawful request       therefor made to the said James Burbage, his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#8)"],[1,"tuted, with their employees, natives and dogs,  the whole population of St. Michael. Good sidewalks connected these  different stations and commanded fine and extensive views of the  surrounding water.    St. Michael, as an island, is not large, and is entirely without trees  or timber. However, there is deep, wet moss or tundra everywhere, as one  soon discovers to his sorrow if he attempts to leave the plank walks.  St. Michael Bay, lying between the island and the mainland on the east,  is a fine body of water. The coast line is well defined with ranges of  mountains zigzagging their cold and snowy peaks, blue tinted or purple  during the day, and pink in the setting sun.    St. Michael is the windiest place on earth. After a few days spent in  studying the native dress of the Eskimos, and in trying to adapt my own  dress to the freakish breezes I concluded that if I stayed at St.  Michael I should dress as they did. If I started for the eating room  with my hat properly placed on hair arranged with ever so much care, a  heavy beaver cape, and dress of walking length, I was completely  demoralized in appearance five minutes later on reaching the mess-house.  With a twisting motion which was so sudden as to totally surprise me, my  dress was wound around my feet, my cape was flung as if by spiteful  hands entirely over my head, causing me to step in my confusion from the  plank walk; while my hat was perched sidewise anywhere above or on my  shoulder. One unfortunate woman wearing an overskirt covering a striped  cambric sham, was seen daily struggling, with intense disgust on her  face, up the steps of the eating house, with her unruly overskirt  waving wildly in the wind.    But this wind did not keep the Eskimo women and children at home.  Dressed in their fur parkies, which are a sort of long blouse with hood  attachment, short skirts and muckluks, or skin boots, they trotted down  to the beach daily to fish, standing on the wet and slippery rocks,  regardless of wind, spray or snow. Here they flung their fish lines out  into the water and hauled the little fish up dexterously; when, with a  curious twitch they disengaged the finny fellows and tossed them into a  big pan. Little Eskimo children ran on in front of their mothers, and  shaggy dogs followed close behind at the smell of the fish.          CHAPTER VI    COMPANIONS.      But there were passengers arriving at St. Michael each day from  different points bound for Nome.    At last the side-wheeler \"Sadie\" was to leave for Nome, and what a  commotion! Men in fur coats, caps and mittens, leading dogs of all  colors and sizes, some barking, but all hustled along with no thought of  anything except to reach Cape Nome as quickly as possible. At last they  were off. A rough, and in some instances a drunken lot, but all  hopefully happy and sure that they would \"strike it rich\" in the new  gold fields. Many, no doubt, were going to their death, many to  hardships and disappointments undreamed of, while a few would find gold  almost inexhaustible.    Still we waited day after day for the ocean steamer \"Bertha.\" One Sunday  morning we looked from the hotel windows to see a clear, cold sky, with  sun and high wind. About ten o'clock we heard a steamer whistling for  assistance. She was small and used for errands by one of the steamship  companies. Still none went to the rescue, as the gale was terrific. A  steam tug started out, but she passed by on the other side, not caring  to act the part of good Samaritan to a rival. In a few moments the  fires of the little steamer were out,--she was sinking. Through a glass  we saw three men on the roof of the craft--then they clung to the  smokestack. A larger steamer, though herself disabled, finally reached  the three drowning men. It was not a moment too soon, for the water was  icy, the gale fearful. They were then hauled in, almost exhausted and  frozen.    It was a wild day. Soon after noon, one of the two big covered barges in  tow by the \"Lackme,\" already loaded for a start for Nome, began to sink.  The wind came from the north, and little by little the barge became  unmanageable, until at last she was cut loose and deserted. For an hour  we watched the barge, until, she too, sank out of sight beneath the  waters of the bay.    Small steamers still came straggling in from Dawson crowded with  passengers going to the new gold fields, and our tired cooks and  stewards in the kitchens were rushed both day and night. Here the price  of a meal, to all but those having through tickets to San Francisco, was  one dollar, and fifteen hundred meals a day were frequently served.    In this hotel we waited two weeks, patiently at times, restlessly at  other times. What would we do if the Bertha failed to appear? Possibly  she was lost, and now drifting, a worthless derelict, at the mercy of  the winds! Not another boat would or could carry us, tickets on each one  having long ago been sold. If we should be frozen in all winter, with  no way of letting our friends at home know of our whereabouts for six  months, how terrible would be their anxiety, how hard for us in this  exposed spot near the Arctic Sea! Many times a day and in the night did  this emergency present itself to us, and we shuddered. Each day we  climbed the hill a quarter of a mile away to look, Robinson Crusoe like,  over the ocean to see if we could discover the \"Bertha.\"    In the meantime, with note book and pencil in hand I often sat in the  parlor; and, while occupied to a certain extent, I gathered sundry bits  of information regarding the gold fields in this wonderful new Golconda.  Two million dollars, it was said, had already been extracted from the  beach at Nome, and no estimate could be made on what was still there.  The pay streak ran to the water's edge, and even farther, but just how  far, no one knew.    Back of this beach spread the tundra, an expanse of marsh, ice and  water, which extends some four miles inland. The size of the claims  allowed by law is one thousand three hundred and twenty feet in length,  and six hundred and sixty feet in width; or about twenty acres of land.  The insignificant sum of $2.50 is required to be paid the recorder.    In the York District the area allowed for claims is smaller, being five  hundred feet in width, and the length depending on the geographical  formation or creek upon which the claim is situated.    North of Nome there are ninety to one hundred miles of gold-bearing  beach to be worked, and again to the south a vast stretch of like  character extending to Norton Bay. The tundra, which is nothing but the  old beach, follows the present shore, and is fully as rich as the  surf-washed sands. More productive and larger than all is the inland  region traversed by rivers and creeks that form a veritable network of  streams, all bordered by gold-producing soil.    Anvil Creek, Sunset Gulch, Snow Gulch and Dexter Creek, near Nome, are  all exceedingly rich; one claim on Snow Gulch having been sold for  $185,000, and another for $13,000.    Golovin Bay District is situated eighty-five miles east of Nome City,  and is large and very rich. Fish River is the principal one in this  section, and has innumerable small tributaries running into it, most of  which are also rich in gold.    Casa de Paga is a tributary of the Neukluk River, and very rich. On  Ophir Creek, claim No. four, above Discovery, $48,000 was taken out in  nineteen days by the Dusty Diamond Company working seventeen men. On  number twenty-nine above Discovery on Ophir Creek, seventeen dollars  were taken out a day per man, who dug out frozen gravel, thawed it by  the heat of a coal-oil stove, and afterward rocked it.    There was much discussion over the rights of those claiming mining lands  located by the power of attorney; though the majority of men here  seemed to believe they would hold good, and many such papers were made  out in due legal form.    At last, on the morning of October ninth, the \"Bertha\" really appeared.  It was a clear, cold day, sunny and calm. I ran in high spirits to the  top of the hill overlooking the bay to get a good view. Sure enough,  there lay the \"Bertha\" on the bright waters as though she had always  been there. How rejoiced everyone was! How relieved were those who  intended to remain here because of the additions to the winter's  supplies, and how rejoiced were those waiting to get away? How we all  bustled about, packing up, buying papers and magazines just from the  steamer, sealing and stamping letters, making notes in diaries, taking  kodak views, saying good-bye to acquaintances, ad infinitum.    All were willing to leave. Finally on the afternoon of the tenth we were  stowed into the big covered barge which was to take us out to the  \"Bertha.\" It was cold and draughty inside, so we found a sheltered place  in the sun on some piles of luggage, and sat there. As the \"Bertha\" was  reached, a gangplank was thrown over to the barge, which came as close  alongside as possible, and up this steep and narrow board we climbed,  clinging to a rope held by men on both decks.    Our trouble had now begun. We were overjoyed at making a start at last,  but under what conditions! The river steamer \"Hannah\" had been a model  of neatness as compared with this one. On deck there were coops of  chickens, and pens of live sheep and pigs brought from San Francisco to  be put off at Nome, as well as a full passenger list for the same place.  On the way here a landing had been attempted at Nome, but the surf had  been so tremendous that it could not be accomplished, and passengers  still occupied the staterooms that we were to have. However, we were  temporarily sandwiched in, and, about four P. M., said good-bye to St.  Michael.    It was a lovely day and the waters of the bay were very calm. Along  shore in the most sheltered places were numbers of river steamers and  smaller craft being snugly tucked up for the"]]]
