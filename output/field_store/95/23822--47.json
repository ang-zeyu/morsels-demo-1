He was the colonel's servant at one time, but he got drunk  one day, and of course the colonel had to send him back to the  ranks. One of the officers told me about him when he came in, and  said that he was one of the best riders and swordsmen in the  regiment. The adjutant told me that he has specially chosen him for  you, because he had a particularly good mount, and that as your  orderly it would be of great importance that he should be able to  keep up with you. Of course, he got the horse when he was the  colonel's orderly; and though he was sent back to the ranks six  months ago, the colonel, who was really fond of the man, allowed  him to keep it.\"    \"I thought it seemed an uncommonly good animal, when he led it into  the stable,\" Fergus said. \"Plenty of bone, and splendid quarters. I  hope he was not unwilling to come to me. It is a great fall from  being a colonel's servant to become a cornet's.\"    \"I don't suppose he will mind that; and at any rate, while he is  here the berth will be such an easy one that I have no doubt he  will be well content with it, and I daresay that he and Donald will  get on well together.    \"Donald is a Cuirassier. After Keith appointed me as one of his  aides, he got me transferred to the Cuirassiers, who are stationed  at Potsdam. That was how I came to get hold of Donald as a  servant.\"    A few minutes after they had done dinner, there was a knock at the  door. The orderly entered and saluted.    \"You will find my man in there,\" Lindsay said. \"At present, Mr.  Drummond and I are living together. I daresay you and he will get  on very comfortably.\"    For the next fortnight, Fergus spent the whole day in barracks. He  was not put through the usual preliminary work, but the colonel,  understanding what would be most useful to him, had him instructed  in the words of command necessary for carrying out simple  movements, his place as cornet with a troop when in line or column;  and being quick, intelligent, and anxious to learn, Fergus soon  began to feel himself at home.        Chapter 3: The Outbreak Of War.      As Lindsay had predicted, the marshal had, on the evening of the  day Fergus joined his regiment, said to him:    \"I generally have half an hour's fencing the first thing of a  morning, Fergus. It is good exercise, and keeps one's muscles  lissome. Come round to my room at six. I should like to see what  the instructors at home have done for you, and I may be able to put  you up to a few tricks of the sword that may be of use to you, if  you are ever called upon to break his majesty's edicts against  duelling.\"    Fergus, of course, kept the appointment.    \"Very good. Very good, indeed,\" the marshal said, after the first  rally. \"You have made the most of your opportunities. Your wrist is  strong and supple, your eye quick. You are a match, now, for most  men who have not worked hard in a school of arms. Like almost all  our countrymen, you lack precision. Now, let us try again.\"    For a few minutes Fergus exerted himself to the utmost, but failed  to get his point past the marshal's guard. He had never seen  fencing like this. Keith's point seemed to be ever threatening him.  The circles that were described were so small that the blade seemed  scarcely to move; and yet every thrust was put aside by a slight  movement of the wrist, and he felt that he was at his opponent's  mercy the whole time. Presently there was a slight jerk and, on the  instant, his weapon was twisted from his hand and sent flying  across the room.    Keith smiled at his look of bewilderment.    \"You see, you have much to learn, Fergus.\"    \"I have indeed, sir. I thought that I knew something about fencing,  but I see that I know nothing at all.\"    \"That is going too far the other way, lad. You know, for example, a  vast deal more than Lindsay did when he came to me, six months ago.  I fancy you know more than he does now, or ever will know; for he  still pins his faith on the utility of a slashing blow, as if the  sabre had a chance against a rapier, in the hands of a skilful man.  However, I will give you a lesson every morning, and I should  advise you to go to Van Bruff every evening.    \"I will give you a note to him. He is by far the best master we  have. Indeed, he is the best in Europe. I will tell him that the  time at your disposal is too short for you to attempt to become a  thorough swordsman; but that you wish to devote yourself to  learning a few thrusts and parries, such as will be useful in a  duel, thoroughly and perfectly. I myself will teach you that trick  I played on you just now, and two others like it; and I think it  possible that in a short time you will be able to hold your own,  even against men who may know a good deal more of the principles  and general practice of the art than yourself.\"    Armed with a note from the marshal, Fergus went the next day to the  famous professor. The latter read the letter through carefully, and  then said:    \"I should be very glad to oblige the marshal, for whom I have the  highest respect, and whom I regard as the best swordsman in Europe.  I often practise with him, and always come away having learned  something. Moreover, the terms he offers, for me to give you an  hour and a half's instruction every evening, are more than liberal.  But every moment of my time in the evening is occupied, from five  to ten. Could you come at that hour?\"    \"Certainly I could, professor.\"    \"Then so be it. Come at ten, punctually. My school is closed at  that hour, but you will find me ready for you.\"    Accordingly, during the next three weeks Fergus worked, from ten  till half-past eleven, with Herr Van Bruff; and from six till half  past with the marshal. His mountain training was useful indeed to  him now; for the day's work in the barrack was in itself hard and  fatiguing and, tough as his muscles were, his wrist at first ached  so at nights that he had to hold it, for some time, under a tap of  cold water to allay the pain. At the end of a week, however, it  hardened again; and he was sustained by the commendations of his  two teachers, and the satisfaction he felt in the skill he was  acquiring.    \"Where is your new aide-de-camp, marshal?\" the king asked, one  evening.    It was the close of one of his receptions.    \"As a rule, these young fellows are fond of showing off in their  uniforms, at first.\"    \"He is better employed, sire. He has the makings of a very fine  swordsman and, having some reputation myself that way, I should be  glad that my young cousin should be able to hold his own well, when  we get to blows with the enemy. So I and Van Bruff have taken him  in hand, and for the last three weeks he has made such progress  that this morning, when we had open play, it put me on my mettle to  hold my own. So, what with that and his regimental work, his hands  are more than full; and indeed, he could not get through it, had he  to attend here in the evening; and I know that as soon as he has  finished his supper he turns in for a sound sleep, till he is woke  in time to dress and get to the fencing school, at ten. Had there  been a longer time to spare, I would not have suffered him to work  so hard; but seeing that in a few days we may be on the march to  the frontier, we have to make the most of the time.\"    \"He has done well, Keith, and his zeal shows that he will make a  good soldier. Yes, another three days, and our messenger should  return from Vienna; and the next morning, unless the reply is  satisfactory, the troops will be on the move. After that, who  knows?\"    During the last few days, the vague rumours that had been  circulating had gained strength and consistency. Every day fresh  regiments arrived and encamped near the city; and there were  reports that a great concentration of troops was taking place, at  Halle, under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; and  another, under the Duke of Bevern, at Frankfort-on-the-Oder.    Nevertheless, the public announcement that war was declared with  Austria, and that the army would march for the frontier, in three  days' time, came as a sudden shock. The proclamation stated that,  it having been discovered that Austria had entered into a secret  confederacy with other powers to attack Prussia; and the king  having, after long and fruitless negotiations, tried to obtain  satisfaction from that power; no resource remained but to declare  war, at once, before the confederates could combine their forces  for the destruction of the kingdom.    Something like dismay was, at first, excited by the proclamation. A  war with Austria was, in itself, a serious undertaking; but if the  latter had powerful allies, such as Russia, France, and Saxony--and  it was well known that all three looked with jealousy on the  growing power of the kingdom--the position seemed well-nigh  desperate.    Among the troops, however, the news was received with enthusiasm.  Confident in their strength and discipline, the question of the  odds that might be assembled against them in no way troubled them.  The conquest of Silesia had raised the prestige of the army, and  the troops felt proud that they should have the opportunity of  proving their valour in an even more serious struggle.    Never was there a more brilliant assembly than that at the palace,  the evening before the troops marched. All the general officers and  their staffs were assembled, together with the ladies of the court,  and those of the nobility and army. The king was in high good  humour, and moved about the rooms, chatting freely with all.    \"So you have come to see us at last, young sir,\" he said to Fergus.  \"I should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#8)"],[1," have been Perpendicularised, probably when the  vault was added, and the Norman character of the lateral shafts spoilt  by scraping.    The building of the nave is usually attributed to Bishop Eborard  (1121-45), but some eminent archaeologists believe that the whole  cathedral, nave and all, was built by Herbert, 1091-1119, the first  bishop and founder. We believe there is no documentary evidence against  this theory. The _Registrum Primum_ says: \"Moreover, the same Herbert  completed the church of Norwich in his own time, as I have learned from  the account of old people, _but have not found in writing,_ as far as  the altar of the holy cross, which is now called the altar of S.  William.\"    The billet enrichment on the main arches, and the chevron or zig-zag on  those of the triforium, have been looked upon as indicating that this  part of the building--the five western bays of nave--is later than the  presbytery, the arches there lacking this ornament. But as these are  quite the earliest forms of ornament used by the Norman builders, their  occurrence here at Norwich cannot prove much. It is better perhaps to  reserve judgment, and be content with merely stating the facts and the  more generally accredited theories as to the age of the western part of  the nave.    The subsidiary circular columns in the fifth bay of the nave from the  west end should be noticed. A small enriched shaft in the clerestory of  the north transept is here illustrated. This very beautiful style of  treatment was common to the Norman builder, with the Romanesque, and the  Romans before them.    #The Choir Screen# crosses the nave between the subsidiary piers to the  sixth bay. Of the original work erected by Bishop Lyhart, 1446-72, the  sub-structure of the present screen is the only portion remaining.  Traces of two altars, one on either side of the doorway, can still be  seen; these were originally dedicated to St. William of Norwich and St.  Mary. These altars were enclosed in chapels formed by screens coming  forward to the extent of half the bay, and stopped against the main nave  piers on either side--the double vaulting shafts on the face of which  are stopped by corbels, carved as heads, at about the height that the  chapels would have reached. They were vaulted over, and above came the  rood loft and organ. The rood loft was damaged by the Puritans, and  probably removed after the Restoration. Dean Crofts, in 1660, set up a  new organ.    In Britton's \"Norwich,\" 1816, the upper stage of the choir screen is  shown divided into square panels, occurring vertically over the lower  stage; the screens to the chapels before referred to having been  destroyed. In 1833 Salvin remodelled the choir, and turned his attention  to the choir screen: the organ was placed in its present position, and  cased with the frame of that instrument which Dean Crofts had set up in  1660; and the overhanging vault to the screen was added.    #The Nave Vault# (height 72 feet), which was added by Bishop Lyhart,  1446-72, took the place of the original Norman wooden roof destroyed by  fire in 1463. This earlier Norman roof was most probably like that now  existing at Peterborough, and was no doubt profusely decorated with  colour. The vault is of Perpendicular design, and known as _lierne_;  such vaults may be distinguished by the fact that between the main ribs,  springing from the vaulting shafts, are placed cross ribs forming a  pattern, as it were, and bracing the main ribs, but not in any great  measure structural. This vault at Norwich may be taken as typical of the  last legitimate development of the stone roof; it was the precursor of  the later fan vaulting, such as we find in Henry VII.'s chapel at  Westminster, where legitimate construction was replaced by ostentatious  ingenuity and the accumulation of needless ornament and detail.    The carved bosses here at Norwich, occurring at the intersection of the  ribs, are worth careful study. Those who care to go into the matter in  the fullest detail should consult Dean Goulburn's book published in  1876, which not only gives an admirable history of the fabric and the  See, but enters fully into the detail and symbolic meaning of each of  the 328 bosses.    In this list, compiled from that volume, mention is made only of those  bosses on the main longitudinal rib of the vault; it is hoped that this  method will enable the visitor to readily enter into the meaning of any  group of bosses, by providing a keynote to the whole. The subjects are  taken from Bible history, and each epoch is usually grouped around some  central incident figured on the main longitudinal ribs. In each bay No.  4 is the large central boss.

To all those who take an interest in early stone cutting, this vault of  Norwich is a store of inexhaustible treasure; the bosses, rudely cut as  they are, tell their own tales with singular truth and directness. Their  sculpture may not display the anatomical knowledge of the work of the  Renaissance; yet it has a distinct decorative value that has been seldom  equalled in the later decadent period. The fourteen large central bosses  on the main longitudinal ribs present in themselves an epitome not only  of Bible history, but of the connecting incidents forming the theme of  Christian teaching. In the tenth bay, on the longitudinal rib, there is,  in place of a boss, a circular hole through the vault. It is supposed to  have been formed to allow a thurible to be suspended therefrom into the  church below. Harrod, quoting from Lambard's \"Topographical Dictionary,\"  says: \"I myself, being a child, once saw in Poule's Church at London, at  a feast of Whitsontide, wheare the comyng down of the Holy Gost was set  forth by a white pigeon that was let to fly _out of a hole that is yet  to be seen in the mydst of the roof of the great ile_, and by a long  censer which, descending out of the same place almost to the very  ground, was swinged up and down at such a length that it reached at one  swepe _almost to the west gate of the church, and with the other to the  queer_ [_quire_] _stairs of the same_, breathing out over the whole  church and companie a most pleasant perfume of such sweet things as  burned therein.\"    It is probable that the hole in the nave vault at Norwich was used for a  similar purpose; and its position would seem to agree with such use,  situated as it is about midway between the west end and where the front  of the mediaeval rood loft occurred.    #The West"]]]
