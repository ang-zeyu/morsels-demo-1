Mr Bramble no sooner received  this reply, than his eyes began to glisten, his face grew pale, and his  teeth chattered. After a moment's pause, he slipt on his shoes, without  speaking a word, or seeming to feel any further disturbance from the  gout in his toes. Then snatching his cane, he opened the door and  proceeded to the place where the black trumpeters were posted. There,  without further hesitation, he began to belabour them both; and exerted  himself with such astonishing vigour and agility, that both their heads  and horns were broken in a twinkling, and they ran howling down stairs  to their master's parlour-door. The squire, following them half way,  called aloud, that the colonel might hear him, 'Go, rascals, and tell  your master what I have done; if he thinks himself injured, he knows  where to come for satisfaction. As for you, this is but an earnest of  what you shall receive, if ever you presume to blow a horn again here,  while I stay in the house.' So saying, he retired to his apartment, in  expectation of hearing from the West Indian; but the colonel prudently  declined any farther prosecution of the dispute. My sister Liddy was  frighted into a fit, from which she was no sooner recovered, than Mrs  Tabitha began a lecture upon patience; which her brother interrupted  with a most significant grin, 'True, sister, God increase my patience  and your discretion. I wonder (added he) what sort of sonata we are to  expect from this overture, in which the devil, that presides over horrid  sounds, hath given us such variations of discord--The trampling of  porters, the creaking and crashing of trunks, the snarling of curs, the  scolding of women, the squeaking and squalling of fiddles and hautboys  out of tune, the bouncing of the Irish baronet over-head, and the  bursting, belching, and brattling of the French-horns in the passage  (not to mention the harmonious peal that still thunders from the Abbey  steeple) succeeding one another without interruption, like the different  parts of the same concert, have given me such an idea of what a poor  invalid has to expect in this temple, dedicated to Silence and Repose,  that I shall certainly shift my quarters to-morrow, and endeavour to  effectuate my retreat before Sir Ulic opens the ball with my lady Mac  Manus; a conjunction that bodes me no good.' This intimation was by no  means agreeable to Mrs Tabitha, whose ears were not quite so delicate as  those of her brother--She said it would be great folly to move from  such agreeable lodgings, the moment they were comfortably settled. She  wondered he should be such an enemy to music and mirth. She heard no  noise but of his own making: it was impossible to manage a family in  dumb-shew. He might harp as long as he pleased upon her scolding; but  she never scolded, except for his advantage; but he would never be  satisfied, even tho'f she should sweat blood and water in his service--I  have a great notion that our aunt, who is now declining into the most  desperate state of celibacy, had formed some design upon the heart of  Sir Ulic Mackilligut, which she feared might be frustrated by our abrupt  departure from these lodgings. Her brother, eyeing her askance, 'Pardon  me, sister (said he) I should be a savage, indeed, were I insensible of  my own felicity, in having such a mild, complaisant, good-humoured, and  considerate companion and housekeeper; but as I have got a weak head,  and my sense of hearing is painfully acute, before I have recourse to  plugs of wool and cotton, I'll try whether I can't find another lodging,  where I shall have more quiet and less music.' He accordingly dispatched  his man upon this service; and next day he found a small house in  Milsham-street, which he hires by the week. Here, at least, we enjoy  convenience and quiet within doors, as much as Tabby's temper will  allow; but the squire still complains of flying pains in the stomach  and head, for which he bathes and drinks the waters. He is not so bad,  however, but that he goes in person to the pump, the rooms, and the  coffeehouses; where he picks up continual food for ridicule and satire.  If I can glean any thing for your amusement, either from his observation  or my own, you shall have it freely, though I am afraid it will poorly  compensate the trouble of reading these tedious insipid letters of,    Dear Phillips, Yours always, J. MELFORD          To Dr LEWIS. BATH, April 23. DEAR DOCTOR,    If I did not know that the exercise of your profession has habituated  you to the hearing of complaints, I should make a conscience of  troubling you with my correspondence, which may be truly called the  lamentations of Matthew Bramble. Yet I cannot help thinking I have  some right to discharge the overflowings of my spleen upon you, whose  province it is to remove those disorders that occasioned it; and let  me tell you, it is no small alleviation of my grievances, that I have a  sensible friend, to whom I can communicate my crusty humours, which, by  retention, would grow intolerably acrimonious.    You must know, I find nothing but disappointment at Bath; which is  so altered, that I can scarce believe it is the same place that I  frequented about thirty years ago. Methinks I hear you say, 'Altered it  is, without all doubt: but then it is altered for the better; a truth  which, perhaps, you would own without hesitation, if you yourself was  not altered for the worse.' The reflection may, for aught I know, be  just. The inconveniences which I overlooked in the high-day of health,  will naturally strike with exaggerated impression on the irritable  nerves of an invalid, surprised by premature old age, and shattered with  long-suffering--But, I believe, you will not deny, that this place,  which Nature and Providence seem to have intended as a resource  from distemper and disquiet, is become the very centre of racket and  dissipation. Instead of that peace, tranquillity, and case, so necessary  to those who labour under bad health, weak nerves, and irregular  spirits; here we have nothing but noise, tumult, and hurry; with the  fatigue and slavery of maintaining a ceremonial, more stiff, formal, and  oppressive, than the etiquette of a German elector. A national hospital  it may be, but one would imagine that none but lunatics are admitted;  and truly, I will give you leave to call me so, if I stay much longer at  Bath.--But I shall take another opportunity to explain my sentiments  at greater length on this subject--I was impatient to see the boasted  improvements in architecture, for which the upper parts of the town have  been so much celebrated and t'other day I made a circuit of all the new  buildings. The Square, though irregular, is, on the whole, pretty well  laid out, spacious, open, and airy; and, in my opinion, by far the most  wholesome and agreeable situation in Bath, especially the upper side of  it; but the avenues to it are mean, dirty, dangerous, and indirect. Its  communication with the Baths, is through the yard of an inn, where the  poor trembling valetudinarian is carried in a chair, betwixt the heels  of a double row of horses, wincing under the curry-combs of grooms and  postilions, over and above the hazard of being obstructed, or overturned  by the carriages which are continually making their exit or their  entrance--I suppose after some chairmen shall have been maimed, and  a few lives lost by those accidents, the corporation will think, in  earnest, about providing a more safe and commodious passage. The Circus  is a pretty bauble, contrived for shew, and looks like Vespasian's  amphitheatre turned outside in. If we consider it in point of  magnificence, the great number of small doors belonging to the separate  houses, the inconsiderable height of the different orders, the affected  ornaments of the architrave, which are both childish and misplaced,  and the areas projecting into the street, surrounded with iron rails,  destroy a good part of its effect upon the eye; and, perhaps, we shall  find it still more defective, if we view it in the light of convenience.  The figure of each separate dwelling-house, being the segment of a  circle, must spoil the symmetry of the rooms, by contracting them  towards the street windows, and leaving a larger sweep in the space  behind. If, instead of the areas and iron rails, which seem to be of  very little use, there had been a corridore with arcades all round,  as in Covent-garden, the appearance of the whole would have been more  magnificent and striking; those arcades would have afforded an agreeable  covered walk, and sheltered the poor chairmen and their carriages from  the rain, which is here almost perpetual. At present, the chairs stand  soaking in the open street, from morning to night, till they become so  many boxes of wet leather, for the benefit of the gouty and rheumatic,  who are transported in them from place to place. Indeed this is a  shocking inconvenience that extends over the whole city; and, I am  persuaded, it produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm;  even the close chairs, contrived for the sick, by standing in the open  air, have their frize linings impregnated like so many spunges, with the  moisture of the atmosphere, and those cases of cold vapour must give  a charming check to the perspiration of a patient, piping hot from the  Bath, with all his pores wide open.    But, to return to the Circus; it is inconvenient from its situation, at  so great a distance from all the markets, baths, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#8)"],[1,"Romans to be reckoned with and, of course,  if you are near Josephus you run a risk, going wherever he does.\"    \"I shall never be in greater risk, Mary, than we were, together, on  the lake the other day. God helped us, then, and brought us through  it; and I have faith that He will do so, again. It may be that I am  meant to do something useful, before I die. At any rate, when the  Romans come, everyone will have to fight; so I shall be in no  greater danger than any one else.\"    \"I know, John, and I am not speaking quite in earnest. I am sorry  you are going--that is only natural--but I am proud that you are to  be near our great leader, and I believe that our God will be your  shield and protector.    \"And now, we had better go in. Your father will, doubtless, have  much to say to you, this evening; and your mother will grudge every  minute you are out of her sight.\"        Chapter 3: The Revolt Against Rome.      That evening the Rabbi Solomon Ben Manasseh came in, and was  informed of the offer which Josephus had made.    \"You were present, rabbi,\" Simon said, \"at the events which took  place in Jerusalem, and at the defeat of Cestius. John has been  asking me to tell him more about these matters for, now that he is  to be with the governor, it is well that he should be well  acquainted with public affairs.\"    \"I will willingly tell him the history for, as you say, it is right  that the young man should be well acquainted with the public events  and the state of parties and, though the story must be somewhat  long, I will try and not make it tedious.    \"The first tumult broke out in Caesarea, and began by frays between  our people and the Syrian Greeks. Felix the governor took the part  of the Greeks; and many of our people were killed, and more  plundered. When Felix was recalled to Rome, we sent a deputation  there with charges against him; but the Greeks, by means of  bribery, obtained a decree against us, depriving the Jews of  Caesarea of rights of equal citizenship. From this constant  troubles arose but, outside Caesarea, Festus kept all quiet;  putting down robbers, as well as impostors who led the people  astray.    \"Then there came trouble in Jerusalem. King Agrippa's palace stood  on Mount Zion, looking towards the Temple; and he built a lofty  story, from whose platform he could command a view of the courts of  the Temple, and watch the sacrifices. Our people resented this  impious intrusion, and built a high wall to cut off the view.  Agrippa demanded its destruction, on the ground that it intercepted  the view of the Roman guard. We appealed to Nero, and sent to him a  deputation; headed by Ismael, the high priest, and Hilkiah, the  treasurer. They obtained an order for the wall to be allowed to  stand, but Ismael and Hilkiah were detained at Rome. Agrippa  thereupon appointed another high priest--Joseph--but, soon  afterwards, nominated Annas in his place.    \"When Festus--the Roman governor--was away, Annas put to death many  of the sect called Christians, to gratify the Sadducees. The people  were indignant, for these men had done no harm; and Agrippa  deprived him of the priesthood and appointed Jesus, son of Damnai.  Then, unhappily, Festus--who was a just and good governor--died,  and Albinus succeeded him. He was a man greedy of money, and ready  to do anything for gain. He took bribes from robbers, and  encouraged, rather than repressed, evil doers. There was open war,  in the streets, between the followers of various chief robbers.  Albinus opened the prisons, and filled the city with malefactors;  and, at the completion of the works at the Temple, eighteen  thousand workmen were discharged, and thus the city was filled with  men ready to sell their services to the highest bidders.    \"Albinus was succeeded by Gessius Florus, who was even worse than  Albinus. This man was a great friend of Cestius Gallus, who  commanded the Roman troops in Syria; and who, therefore, scoffed at  the complaints of the people against Florus.    \"At this time, strange prodigies appeared in Rome. A sword of fire  hung above the city, for a whole year. The inner gate of the  Temple--which required twenty men to move it--opened by itself;  chariots and armed squadrons were seen in the heavens and, worse  than all, the priests in the Temple heard a great movement, and a  sound of many voices, which said:    \"'Let us depart hence!'    \"So things went on, in Jerusalem, until the old feud at Caesarea  broke out afresh. The trouble, this time, began about one of our  synagogues. The land around it belonged to a Greek and, for this,  our people offered a high price. The heathen who owned it refused  and, to annoy us, raised mean houses round the synagogue. The  Jewish youths interrupted the workmen; and the wealthier of the  community--headed by John, a publican--subscribed eight talents,  and sent them to Florus as a bribe, that he might order the  building to be stopped.    \"Florus took the money, and made many promises; but the evil man  desired that a revolt should take place, in order that he might  gain great plunder. So he went away from Caesarea, and did nothing;  and a great tumult arose between the heathen and our people. In  this we were worsted, and went away from the city; while John, with  twelve of the highest rank, went to Samaria to lay the matter  before Florus; who threw them into prison--doubtless the more to  excite the people--and at the same time sent to Jerusalem, and  demanded seventeen talents from the treasury of the Temple.    \"The people burst into loud outcries, and Florus advanced upon the  city with all his force. But we knew that we could not oppose the  Romans; and so received Florus, on his arrival, with acclamations.  But this did not suit the tyrant. The next morning he ordered his  troops to plunder the upper market, and to put to death all they  met. The soldiers obeyed, and slew three thousand six hundred men,  women, and children.    \"You may imagine, John, the feelings of grief and rage which filled  every heart. The next day the multitude assembled in the  marketplace, wailing for the dead and cursing Florus. But the  principal men of the city, with the priests, tore their robes and  went among them, praying them to disperse and not to provoke the  anger of the governor. The people obeyed their voices, and went  quietly home.    \"But Florus was not content that matters should end so. He sent for  the priests and leaders, and commanded them to go forth and  receive, with acclamations of welcome, two cohorts of troops who  were advancing from Caesarea. The priests called the people  together in the Temple and, with difficulty, persuaded them to obey  the order. The troops, having orders from Florus, fell upon the  people and trampled them down and, driving the multitude before  them, entered the city; and at the same time Florus sallied out  from his palace, with his troops, and both parties pressed forward  to gain the Castle of Antonia, whose possession would lay the  Temple open to them, and enable Florus to gain the sacred treasures  deposited there.    \"But, as soon as the people perceived their object, they ran  together in such vast crowds that the Roman soldiers could not cut  their way through the mass which blocked up the streets; while the  more active men, going up on to the roofs, hurled down stones and  missiles upon the troops.    \"What a scene was that, John! I was on the portico near Antonia,  and saw it all. It was terrible to hear the shouts of the soldiers,  as they strove to hew their way through the defenseless people; the  war cries of our own youths, the shrieks and wailings of the women.  While the Romans were still striving, our people broke down the  galleries connecting Antonia with the Temple; and Florus, seeing  that he could not carry out his object, ordered his troops to  retire to their quarters and, calling the chief priests and the  rulers, proposed to leave the city, leaving behind him one cohort  to preserve the peace.    \"As soon as he had done so, he sent to Cestius Gallus lying  accounts of the tumults, laying all the blame upon us; while we and  Bernice, the sister of King Agrippa--who had tried, in vain, to  obtain mercy for the people from Florus--sent complaints against  him. Cestius was moving to Jerusalem--to inquire into the matter,  as he said, but really to restore Florus--when, fortunately, King  Agrippa arrived from Egypt.    \"While he was yet seven miles from the city, a procession of the  people met him, headed by the women whose husbands had been slain.  These, with cries and wailings, called on Agrippa for protection;  and related to a centurion, whom Cestius had sent forward, and who  met Agrippa on the way, the cruelty of Florus. When the king and  the centurion arrived in the city, they were taken to the  marketplace and shown the houses where the inhabitants had been  massacred.    \"Agrippa called the people together and, taking his seat on a lofty  dais, with Bernice by his side, harangued them. He assured them  that, when the emperor heard what had been done, he would send a  better governor to them, in the place of Florus. He told them that  it was vain to hope for independence, for that the Romans had  conquered all the nations in the world; and that the Jews could not  contend against them, and that war would bring about the  destruction of the city, and the Temple. The people exclaimed they  had taken up arms, not against the Romans, but against Florus.    \"Agrippa urged us to pay our tribute, and repair the galleries.  This was willingly done. We sent out leading men to collect the  arrears of tribute, and these soon brought in forty talents. All  was going on well, until Agrippa tried to persuade us to receive  Florus, till the emperor should send another governor. At the  thought of the return of Florus, a mad rage seized the people. They  poured abuse upon Agrippa, threw stones at him, and"]]]
