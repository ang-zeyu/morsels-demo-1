Prominent among the Anglo-Saxon amusements of Christmastide, Strutt  mentions their propensity for gaming with dice, as derived from their  ancestors, for Tacitus assures us that the ancient Germans would not  only hazard all their wealth, but even stake their liberty, upon the  turn of the dice: \"and he who loses submits to servitude, though  younger and stronger than his antagonist, and patiently permits  himself to be bound and sold in the market; and this madness they  dignify by the name of honour.\" Chess and backgammon were also  favourite games with the Anglo-Saxons, and a large portion of the  night was appropriated to the pursuit of these sedentary amusements,  especially at the Christmas season of the year, when the early  darkness stopped out-door games.     \"When they had dined, as I can you say,    Lords and ladies went to play;    Some to tables, and some to chess,    With other games more and less.\"[10]    Our Saxon forefathers were very superstitious. They had many  pretenders to witchcraft. They believed in the powers of philtres and  spells, and invocated spirits; and they relished a blood-curdling  ghost story at Christmas quite as much as their twentieth-century  descendants. They confided in prognostics, and believed in the  influence of particular times and seasons; and at Christmastide they  derived peculiar pleasure from their belief in the immunity of the  season from malign influences--a belief which descended to Elizabethan  days, and is referred to by Shakespeare, in \"Hamlet\":--     \"Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes,    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,    So hallowed and so gracious is the time.\"    [Illustration: ADORATION OF THE MAGI  OLD GLASS WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL]    We cannot pass over this period without mentioning a great Christmas  in the history of our Teutonic kinsmen on the Continent, for the  Saxons of England and those of Germany have the same Teutonic origin.  We refer to      THE CROWNING OF CHARLEMAGNE EMPEROR OF THE ROMANS ON CHRISTMAS DAY.    The coronation took place at Rome, on Christmas Day, in the year 800.  Freeman[11] says that when Charles was King of the Franks and Lombards  and Patrician of the Romans, he was on very friendly terms with the  mighty Offa, King of the Angles that dwelt in Mercia. Charles and Offa  not only exchanged letters and gifts, but each gave the subjects of  the other various rights in his dominions, and they made a league  together, \"for that they two were the mightiest of all the kings that  dwelt in the Western lands.\" As conqueror of the old Saxons in  Germany, Charles may be regarded as the first King of all Germany, and  he was the first man of any Teutonic nation who was called Roman  Emperor. He was crowned with the diadem of the Caesars, by Pope Leo, in  the name of Charles Augustus, Emperor of the Romans. And it was held  for a thousand years after, down to the year 1806, that the King of  the Franks, or, as he was afterwards called, the King of Germany, had  a right to be crowned by the Pope of Rome, and to be called Emperor of  the Romans. In the year 1806, however, the Emperor Francis the Second,  who was also King of Hungary and Archduke of Austria, resigned the  Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Germany. Since that time no Emperor of  the Romans has been chosen; but a new German Emperor has been created,  and the event may be regarded as one of Christmastide, for the  victorious soldiers who brought it about spent their Christmas in the  French capital, and during the festival arranged for the  re-establishment of the German Empire. So it happens, that while  referring to the crowning of the first German Emperor of the Roman  Empire, on Christmas Day, 800, we are able to record that more than a  thousand years afterwards the unification of the German Empire and the  creation of its first Emperor also occurred at Christmastide, under  the influence of the German triumphs over the French in the war of  1870. The imposing event was resolved upon by the German Princes on  December 18, 1870, the preliminaries were completed during the  Christmas festival, and on January 18, 1871, in the Galerie des Glaces  of the chateau of Versailles, William, King of Prussia, was crowned  and proclaimed first Emperor of the new German Empire.    Now, going back again over a millennium, we come to      CHRISTMAS IN THE TIME OF ALFRED THE GREAT.    During the reign of Alfred the Great a law was passed with relation to  holidays, by virtue of which the twelve days after the Nativity of our  Saviour were set apart for the celebration of the Christmas festival.  Some writers are of opinion that, but for Alfred's strict observance  of the \"full twelve holy days,\" he would not have been defeated by the  Danes in the year 878. It was just after Twelfth-night that the Danish  host came suddenly--\"bestole,\" as the old Chronicle says--to  Chippenham. Then \"they rode through the West Saxons' land, and there  sat down, and mickle of the folk over sea they drove, and of others  the most deal they rode over; all but the King Alfred; he with a  little band hardly fared after the woods and on the moor-fastnesses.\"  But whether or not Alfred's preparations for the battle just referred  to were hindered by his enjoyment of the festivities of Christmastide  with his subjects, it is quite certain that the King won the hearts of  his people by the great interest he took in their welfare. This good  king--whose intimacy with his people we delight to associate with the  homely incident of the burning of a cottager's cakes--kept the  Christmas festival quite as heartily as any of the early English  kings, but not so boisterously as some of them. Of the many beautiful  stories told about him, one might very well belong to Christmastide.  It is said that, wishing to know what the Danes were about, and how  strong they were, King Alfred one day set out from Athelney in the  disguise of a Christmas minstrel, and went into the Danish camp, and  stayed there several days, amusing the Danes with his playing, till he  had seen all he wanted, and then went back without any one finding him  out.    Now, passing on to      CHRISTMAS UNDER THE DANISH KINGS OF ENGLAND,    we find that in 961 King Edgar celebrated the Christmas  festival with great splendour at York; and in 1013 Ethelred  kept his Christmas with the brave citizens of London who had  defended the capital during a siege and stoutly resisted Swegen,  the tyrant king of the Danes. Sir Walter Scott, in his beautiful  poem of \"Marmion,\" thus pictures the \"savage Dane\" keeping  the great winter festival:--     \"Even, heathen yet, the savage Dane    At Iol more deep the mead did drain;    High on the beach his galleys drew,    And feasted all his pirate crew;    Then in his low and pine-built hall,    Where shields and axes deck'd the wall,    They gorged upon the half-dress'd steer;    Caroused in seas of sable beer;    While round, in brutal jest, were thrown    The half-gnaw'd rib, and marrow bone:    Or listen'd all, in grim delight.    While Scalds yell'd out the joys of fight.    Then forth, in frenzy, would they hie,    While wildly-loose their red locks fly,    And dancing round the blazing pile,    They make such barbarous mirth the while,    As best might to the mind recall    The boisterous joys of Odin's hall.\"    When the citizens of London saw that Swegen had succeeded all over  England except their own city, they thought it was no use holding out  any longer, and they too, submitted and gave hostages. And so Swegen  was the first Dane who was king, or (as Florence calls him) \"Tyrant  over all England;\" and Ethelred, sometimes called the \"Unready,\" King  of the West Saxons, who had struggled unsuccessfully against the  Danes, fled with his wife and children to his brother-in-law's court  in Normandy. On the death of Swegen, the Danes of his fleet chose his  son Cnut to be King, but the English invited Ethelred to return from  Normandy and renew the struggle with the Danes. He did so, and the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says: \"He held his kingdom with great toil and  great difficulty the while that his life lasted.\" After his death and  that of his son Edmund, Cnut was finally elected and crowned.  Freeman,[12] in recording the event, says that: \"At the Christmas of  1016-1017, Cnut was a third time chosen king over all England, and one  of the first things that he did was to send to Normandy for the  widowed Lady Emma, though she was many years older than he was. She  came over; she married the new king; and was again Lady of the  English. She bore Cnut two children, Harthacnut and Gunhild. Her three  children by Ethelred were left in Normandy. She seems not to have  cared at all for them or for the memory of Ethelred; her whole love  passed to her new husband and her new children. Thus it came about  that the children of Ethelred were brought up in Normandy, and had the  feelings of Normans rather than Englishmen, a thing which again  greatly helped the Norman Conquest.\"    Cnut's first acts of government in England were a series of murders;  but he afterwards became a wise and temperate king. He even identified  himself with the patriotism which had withstood the stranger. He  joined heartily in the festivities of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22065"],[0,"An Elementary Spanish Reader (#8)"],[1,"\"Calla, porque no me deja      Tu ingrata voz trabajar.
