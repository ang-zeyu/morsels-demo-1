Winnie must fight her  own battles, and she would throw in her luck with her peers.    \"You needn't be afraid of me!\" she protested. \"I'd be the very last to  blab; and I like fun as well as anybody.\"    \"I knew it, oh, altogether-wise-in-judgment! Have I not proved thee?\"  returned Netta, with a meaning look in her eyes which only Gwen  understood. \"Now, having established thy reputation, I will return to  my original thingumgigs.\"    \"Oh, Netta, stop being a lunatic, and tell us how you mean to tackle  Grinnie!\" interposed Minna.    \"Well, my little dears, it's extremely simple, but a work of genius  all the same. Genius always is simple, I believe! Behold my mapping  book with its virgin page. Behold also this spotless piece of blotting  paper. I turn it over, and hey, presto! a transformation. Here's my  map, nicely done in pencil, with all the names marked. Nothing to do  but copy it, you see. At the least approach of danger I turn it with  its most innocent side up.\"    The girls sniggered their admiration. Gwen could not approve, but she  did not protest. It was not her business to preach, so she told  herself. As long as she did her own work honestly, she could not begin  her career in the Fifth by assuming the very character she had just  denied. Minna and Annie, inspired by Netta's brilliant idea, were  copying the map on to pieces of blotting paper as fast as they could.    \"It wouldn't be a bad plan to trace it the wrong way, and then rub it  off like a transfer,\" suggested Millicent.    \"Just a little too clever, most astute one! Grinnie comes round to  look, and she'd think you'd got on too quickly, and want to know the  reason why. You're bright, Millicent Cooper, but you're not  far-seeing.\"    \"You'll get caught yourself some time,\" said Millicent.    \"True, O Queen! But I'll have somewhat in the shape of a run first,\"  laughed Netta.    Gwen felt rather indignant as she began her map drawing. She hated  cheating, and it seemed very unjust that Netta and the others should  win credit for what was not fairly their own work.    \"Winnie's not half sharp enough,\" she thought. \"If it were Beatrice,  now, there isn't a girl in the room would dare to try any tricks.\"    Possibly even Winnie had her suspicions. She kept a watchful eye on  the Form, and made an occasional tour round the desks. Netta was  extremely cautious, but all the same her attention to her blotting  paper was rather conspicuous.    \"Netta Goodwin, hand me your mapping book!\"    Netta started in some confusion at the abrupt order, and dropped both  mapbook and blotting paper on to the floor. Gwen, equally startled,  moved her hand hastily and sent her book spinning after the other. It  was a complete accident, but one by which Netta did not hesitate to  profit. Under the shelter of the desk she rapidly substituted Gwen's  piece of blotting paper for her own, then passed up the book with an  air of sangfroid truly heroic in the eyes of Annie, Minna, and  Millicent. Miss Gascoyne examined the pages carefully, but finding  nothing incriminating, supposed she had been mistaken. Netta might be  the chief sinner of the Form, certainly, but she was not invariably at  fault.    \"She thought I was as innocent as Mary's little lamb!\" laughed that  damsel afterwards. \"You were a trump, Gwen, to help me. It was a smart  notion of yours to drop your book too. You did it so promptly!\" Then  putting her arm round Gwen's neck she whispered: \"I helped you when  you were in a tight hole, and I'm glad to see you're going to stand by  me. I shall always count upon you in future.\"    So thus it happened that almost in spite of herself Gwen became  Netta's ally, pledged to support her on all occasions. She was afraid  to risk a quarrel lest Netta should press for the return of the ten  shillings she had lent. The debt felt a millstone round her neck, from  which there was no immediate chance of relief. Netta's particular  clique of friends, proving Gwen safe, included her in their special  set, a compromising arrangement which seemed nevertheless inevitable.  The girls did not really mean much harm, but they were silly and  flippant, and enjoyed evading rules simply for the fun of the thing.  Netta loved to show off before the others, and because she found Miss  Gascoyne an easier victim than Miss Douglas, she kept most of her  sallies for the junior teacher. She could estimate to a nicety the  fine distinction between giving trouble and open defiance. She never  actually overstepped the line, but she contrived to make matters very  unpleasant for poor Winnie. It was her boast that she could always  raise a spark out of Miss Gascoyne, and her admirers were ready to  titter in sympathy.    Winnie, mindful of her position as teacher, never mentioned school  affairs to Gwen; but one day Beatrice tackled the latter on the  subject.    \"I hear you've struck up a friendship with Netta Goodwin,\" she began.  \"I'm very surprised, for she doesn't seem a nice sort of girl.\"    \"She's the only one who's been kind to me,\" returned Gwen, up in arms  at once at Beatrice's tone.    \"Indeed! Well, I wouldn't be too much with her if I were you. I'm  afraid she's anything but desirable.\"    \"Who said I was much with her? Has Winnie been telling tales about  me?\"    \"Don't be nasty, Gwen. You know Winnie never tells.\"    \"There's no particular harm in Netta,\" protested Gwen, taking up the  cudgels for her schoolmate out of sheer contrariness. \"She's only  rather lively and funny. I suppose that's no great crime.\"    \"Are you sure Father would like her?\"    \"Dad doesn't know her, so I can't pretend to say what he'd think of  her,\" retorted Gwen, shuffling out of the matter with what she knew  was a lame excuse.          CHAPTER VI    A Casting Vote      Gwen had not been prepared to find the Fifth exactly a bed of roses,  therefore she was hardly surprised at the thorns which beset her new  path. In spite of the extra teaching from Miss Woodville, she found  the work of the Form extremely difficult, especially in mathematics.  There was a whole book of Euclid theorem which she had not been  through, and the consequence was that every other problem had some  little point proved by a theorem of which she had never heard. It was  a most decided stumblingblock. It is possible to sit and look at a  problem for hours without getting any further if there is just one  statement of whose existence one is not aware. More than once Gwen had  to hand in a blank page, and felt very humiliated at the meaning  glances which passed between Rachel Hunter and Edith Arnold. Neither  of these was yet reconciled to Gwen's presence in the Form. Rachel,  mindful of her own delayed promotion to the Upper School, persisted in  regarding her as an \"intruding kid\", and Edith could not forgive her  intimacy with Netta Goodwin. Manifold small slights and snubs fell to  Gwen's share, and though she affected to make light of them, they  hurt all the same. She knew that under happier auspices she might have  been friendly with Hilda Browne, Iris Watson, Louise Mawson, and  several others of whom Father would have approved, and whom, with his  entire sanction, she might have invited occasionally to the Parsonage.  She was aware that she was in the worst set in the Form, and that not  one of her new chums would pass muster if judged according to her home  standards.    \"I can't ever ask them, that's all,\" she declared. \"Annie's giggles  would give Beatrice a fit, Millicent puts on side horribly, Minna  would probably make fun of everything, Claire Harris is absolutely  vulgar, and as for Netta--no! Dad mustn't see Netta on any account.\"    Another not unexpected trouble had fallen to Gwen's share. As a member  of the Upper Fourth she had, at the beginning of the term, been chosen  Junior Basket-ball Captain, to arrange Lower School team games and  matches, and she had worked very hard to get things going. On her  promotion, however, it had been a greatly discussed point whether she  should resign or finish the season. Some of the Upper Fourth, knowing  how much was due to Gwen's exertions, had been anxious for her to  retain her post, but on the whole the popular verdict was against her.  To Gwen's disgust, her old friends, Eve Dawkins and Alma Richardson,  were the loudest in her disfavour, and it was chiefly owing to their  eloquence that she was requested to resign. She had been proud of her  captaincy, and to give it up was a wrench. There seemed nothing at all  in her new Form to compensate for the loss, and sometimes she wished  heartily that she had never been moved.    The present excitement in the Fifth was a \"Literary and Dramatic  Club\", the members of which intended to act a piece at Christmas. It  was a rather cliquish society, worked with more favour than fairness,  and was principally among those girls whose homes lay near to the  school.    \"They stay behind at four o'clock to rehearse,\" explained Netta. \"It's  really only among about half a dozen.\"    \"Are you in it?\" queried Gwen.    \"I, my dear child? Hardly! You don't imagine the high and mighty Iris  Watson would ask yours truly? Saints and sinners don't mix in this  Form, if you please!\"    \"Do you mean to tell me the whole thing is in the hands of Iris and a  few others?\"    \"With your usual astuteness you've hit the nail on the head.\"    \"But that's monstrously unfair!\" exclaimed Gwen indignantly. \"A  Dramatic Club ought to be for the whole Form. Everybody ought to have  an innings, in the name of common justice.\"    Netta shrugged her shoulders.    \"I don't want to act with Iris and Edith and Louise, thank you! A  pleasant performance it would be! They may keep their precious piece  to themselves, so far as I'm concerned.\"    \"But that's not the point,\" persisted Gwen. \"It's the fairness of the  thing I'm talking about."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#8)"],[1,"a skilful and homogeneous design, which could only be produced by a  man of exceptional ability and great experience. Nothing has been left  to chance, or to the sweet will of the co-operating craftsman, but the  one master-mind has dictated every moulding and every combination, and  has left the impress of his genius upon it all. The mark of the master  may be discerned by the practised eye in every feature of the  magnificent edifice; the marks of the craftsmen may be seen on the work  they were told to do, and did so well.\"[57] To Bishop Joceline is due  the credit of having formed a society to collect funds for the  restoration of Bishop John's church, which was burnt by fire,[58] and he  appears to have rebuilt the choir, and also to have designed, if he did  not also partly build, the nave.[59] This part of his work was  sufficiently advanced for consecration on 6th July 1197.[60] The work  was probably continued by his successors, but the next great benefactor  of the cathedral was Bishop William de Bondington (1233-1258), who  perfected Joceline's work, and built both choir and lower church or  \"crypt,\" as they now are.[61] According to Mr. Honeyman, the foundations  of the nave were laid and part of the walls was carried up before the  building of the choir was begun.[62] Most of the nave appears, from its  architecture, to have been erected at the end of the thirteenth, or the  beginning of the fourteenth century, and is pronounced to form \"one of  the finest examples of the late First Pointed or Early Decorated style  in Scotland.\"[63] \"The spacing (of the piers) is that of the twelfth  century (considerably less than that of the choir), while the height and  the treatment, in other respects, is that of the latter portion of the  thirteenth.\"[64]    Bishop Wishart during the war of Independence supported the Scottish  party; he obtained permission from Edward I. to cut timber in Luss  forest for erecting the spire of the cathedral, and it was one of the  causes of accusation against him, which led to his imprisonment in  England, that he had used the said timber not for building the spire but  for making engines of war wherewith to attack Edward's army. In 1400 the  wooden spire of the cathedral was destroyed by lightning, but a new  tower of masonry was erected over the crossing by Bishop Lauder  (1408-1425), who carried the work as high as the main parapet. \"This  bishop appears also to have begun the completion of the chapter-house, a  detached structure lying to the north-east of the choir. The walls of  this building were partly erected about the time of the construction of  the choir, but were afterwards raised to two storeys in height, and  vaulted by Bishop Cameron.\"[65] This latter prelate (1426-1446) was  known as \"the Magnificent,\" from the splendour of his retinue and court.  He erected the stone spire above the tower of Bishop Lauder, and also  completed the chapter-house wing containing the sacristy on the upper  floor, and the chapter-house on the ground floor. His arms are still to  be seen on the portions of the structure erected by him. The beautiful  rood-screen was also probably constructed by him.[66] Bishop Cameron  also increased the number of prebendaries from seven to thirty-two, and  ordained that they should all have manses and reside near the cathedral.  In his day the episcopal court was said to rival that of the King, and  he built the great tower of the castle or episcopal palace, which was  probably erected by Bishop Bondington and stood with the garden in the  open space between the cathedral and the present Castle Street, now  called Infirmary Square. The Bishop's palace was a Scottish baronial  structure, and had an elaborate turreted gateway or port at the  south-east angle of the wall nearly opposite the gate that now leads to  the cathedral yard.[67] Bishop William Turnbull, who succeeded Bishop  Cameron, held office from 1448 to 1454. He did not add much to the  cathedral, but his memory ought to be gratefully remembered, for in  response to his representation and that of the King, Pope Nicholas V.  issued his bull, on 7th January 1450-1451, by which he erected the  University, ordaining that it should flourish in all time to come, as  well in theology and canon and civil law as in the arts and every lawful  faculty, and that the doctors, masters, readers, and students might  there enjoy all the liberties, honours, exemptions, and immunities  granted by the Apostolic see to the doctors, masters, and students in  the University of Bologna. He gave the power to confer degrees and make  licentiates--an important recognition in those days, for it brought the  influence of the Church on the side of schools of learning, and gave  universal European validity to the degrees so conferred.[68] The Bishop  of Glasgow was the patron and head of the University of Glasgow, which  was thus founded forty years after that of St. Andrews, and forty years  before that of Aberdeen. The next prelate, Bishop Andrew Muirhead  (1455-1473) took an important part in the State affairs of the period,  and as far as his work in the cathedral is concerned, built the hall of  the choral vicars. It is situated between the two buttresses at the west  end of the north aisle of the choir, and is a low building now roofed  with flags. It was called the \"aula vicariorum chori,\" and was built as  an accommodation for the vicars choral, whose duties were to serve and  sing in the choir. They were formed into a college by Bishop Muirhead,  were originally twelve in number, but were afterwards increased to  eighteen, and were aided by boy choristers. Archbishop Eyre thinks that  this building on the north side of the cathedral was the early  song-school of the church, which passed into the hands of the college of  vicars choral, and was a hall for their business meetings and musical  practice, the second storey being probably their reading-room, or the  sleeping-place of the sacristan, who was required to sleep in the  church.[69]    Robert Blacader (1484-1508) was high in favour with King James IV., and  was one of the embassy sent to England to arrange the marriage of the  Scottish monarch with the daughter of Henry VII. James had previously  sought consolation under the Bishop's care, enrolled himself as a  prebendary in the cathedral, and in person attended as a member of the  cathedral-chapter. The King was always favourable to Glasgow, and did  not desire the see to be subordinate to that of St. Andrews. He urged  upon the Pope that the pallium should be granted to the Bishop of  Glasgow, whose cathedral, he urged, \"surpasses the other cathedral  churches of my realm by its structure, its learned men, its foundation,  its ornaments, and other very noble prerogatives.\" A bull was granted in  1491-1492 by Pope Innocent VIII. in which he declared the see to be  metropolitan, and appointed the bishops of Dunkeld, Dunblane, Galloway,  and Argyll to be its suffragans.[70] Blacader was the first Archbishop  of Glasgow, and beautified his cathedral by building or adorning the  fine rood-screen which separates the nave from the choir[71] by founding  altarages and erecting two altars in front of the rood-screen, on both  of which his arms and initials are carved.[72] He built also the  decorated flights of steps from the aisles of the nave to the choir, and  partly erected the building in continuation of the south transept,  called Blacader's aisle, but it was never carried higher than the ground  storey or crypt.[73] It is also known as Fergus's aisle.[74] Archbishop  Blacader was the last to add to the cathedral, and there is reason to  believe that his addition occupies the site of the cemetery consecrated  by St. Ninian, and thus the earliest consecration and the latest  building effort are identified with the same spot.[75]    Glasgow, like Elgin, Aberdeen, and Brechin, possessed originally two  western towers, but at Glasgow, grievously and unfortunately, the  south-west tower was removed in 1845, and the north-west one in 1848 by  the Restoration Committee. They were venerable in their antiquity, and  were probably built after the completion of the nave and aisles, if not  at the same time. Evidence showed \"that probably the north-west tower  was part of the original design, or if not, that its erection was  resolved on before the north aisle was completed, and it was built  before the west window of the north aisle required to be glazed. The  south-west tower was probably of the same date.\"[76] The latter was best  known as the consistory house, and was the place where the bishops held  their ecclesiastical courts and the diocesan records were kept. The only  comfort amid the demolition of the towers is that the proposed new ones  were not erected in their place; and better counsel ought to have  prevailed, since Mr. Billings described the removal as an act of  barbarism. \"All who now see the grand old building, shorn of its  cathedral features, and made like a large parish church, mock and laugh  at the action of the local committee, saying, \"These men had two towers,  and they went and pulled them both down.\"\"[77]    The higher church had twenty-four altars or chapels;[78] the lower  church, commonly but incorrectly called the crypt, had six altars;[79]  the high altar occupied the usual place, was dedicated to St.  Kentigern, had a wooden canopy or tabernacle work over it, and in front  of it, on the right-hand side, was the bishop's throne.[80] When it is  recalled that the cathedral possessed these thirty altars or chapels  (most of them beautiful works of art), thirty-two canons, college of  choral vicars, with other assistants, one can well understand the great,  almost dangerous power which the \"Spiritual Dukedom\" possessed, and the  dread, felt even by its own chapter, when it was first proposed to make  the bishopric into an archbishopric, for they regarded the movement as"]]]
