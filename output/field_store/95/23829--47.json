Nevertheless, he  continued to secure that protection for life and property which his father  had so successfully achieved, so that a man \"who had confidence in  himself\" and was \"aught,\" could travel the length and breadth of the land  unhurt, \"with his bosom full of gold.\"(95) He also had an eye for the  protection of the city, and the advancement of its commerce, surrounding  the Tower of London by a wall, and repairing the bridge which had been  nearly washed away by a flood.(96)    (M66)    On the 2nd August, 1100, the Red King met his death suddenly in the New  Forest, and the next day was buried at Winchester. According to a previous  agreement, the crown should have immediately devolved upon his brother  Robert. Crowns, however, were not to be thus disposed of; they fell only  to those ready and strong enough to seize them. Robert was far away on a  crusade. His younger brother Henry was on the spot, and upon him fell the  choice of such of the witan as happened to be in or near Winchester at the  time of the late king's death.(97)    (M67)    The two days that elapsed before his coronation at Westminster (5th  August), the king-elect spent in London, where by his easy and eloquent  manner, as well as by fair promises, he succeeded in winning the  inhabitants over to his cause, to the rejection of the claims of Robert.  The election, or perhaps we should rather say, the selection of Henry by  the witan at Winchester, was thus approved and confirmed by the whole  realm (_regni universitas_), in the city of London.    The choice was made however on one condition, viz.:--that Henry should  restore to his subjects their ancient liberties and customs enjoyed in the  days of Edward the Confessor.(98) The charter thus obtained served as an  exemplar for the great charter of liberties which was to be subsequently  wrung from King John.    (M68)    Another charter was granted by the new king--a charter to the citizens of  London--granted, as some have thought, soon after his accession, and by way  of recognition of the services they had rendered him towards obtaining the  crown. This however appears to be a mistake. There is reason for supposing  that this charter was not granted until at least thirty years after he was  seated on the throne.(99)    (M69)    The chief features of the grant(100) were that the citizens were  thenceforth to be allowed to hold Middlesex to farm at a rent of L300 a  year, and to appoint from among themselves whom they would to be sheriff  over it; they were further to be allowed to appoint their own justiciar to  hold pleas of the crown, and no other justiciar should exercise authority  over them; they were not to be forced to plead without the city's walls;  they were to be exempt from scot and lot and of all payments in respect of  Danegelt and murder; they were to be allowed to purge themselves after the  English fashion of making oath and not after the Norman fashion by wager  of battle; their goods were to be free of all manner of customs, toll,  passage and lestage; their husting court might sit once a week; and  lastly, they might resort to \"withernam\" or reprisal in cases where their  goods had been unlawfully seized.    (M70)    Touching the true import of this grant of Middlesex to the citizens at a  yearly rent, with the right of appointing their own sheriff over it, no  less than the identity of the justiciar whom they were to be allowed to  choose for themselves for the purpose of hearing pleas of the crown within  the city, much divergence of opinion exists. Some believe that the  government of the city was hereby separated from that of the shire wherein  it was situate, and that the right of appointing their own justiciar which  the citizens obtained by this charter was the right of electing a sheriff  for the city of London in the place of the non-elective ancient  port-reeve. Others deny that the charter introduced the shire organization  into the government of the city, and believe the justiciar and sheriff to  have been distinct officials.(101) The latter appear to hold the more  plausible view. Putting aside the so-called charter of William the First,  granting to the citizens in express terms _civitatem et vice-comitatum  Londoniae_, as wanting in corroboration, a solution of the difficulty may  be found if we consider (1) that the city received a shire organization  and became in itself to all intents and purposes a county as soon as it  came to be governed by a port-reeve, if not as soon as an alderman had  been set over it by Alfred; (2) that the duties of the shrievalty in  respect of the county of the city of London were at this time performed  either by a port-reeve or by one or more officers, known subsequently as  sheriffs, and (3) that for the right of executing these duties no rent or  ferm was ever demanded or paid.(102)    If this be a correct view of the matter, it would appear that the effect  of Henry's grant of Middlesex to the citizens to farm, and of the  appointment of a sheriff over it of their own choice, was not so much to  render the city independent of the shire, as to make the shire subject to  the city. It must be borne in mind that no sheriff (or sheriffs) has ever  been elected by the citizens for Middlesex alone, the duties appertaining  to the sheriff-wick of Middlesex having always been performed by the  sheriffs of the city for the time being.(103) Hence it is that the  shrievalty of London and Middlesex is often spoken of as the shrievalty of  \"London\" alone, and the shrievalty of \"Middlesex\" alone (the same officers  executing the duties of both shrievalties) and the _firma_ of L300 paid  for the shrievalty of Middlesex alone is sometimes described as the  _firma_ of \"London,\" sometimes of \"Middlesex,\" and sometimes of \"London  and Middlesex.\"(104)    (M71)    The right of electing their own justiciar granted to the citizens by Henry  resolves itself into little more than a confirmation of the right to elect  their own sheriffs.(105) Just as sheriffs are known to have held pleas of  the crown in the counties up to the time of the Great Charter (although  their duties were modified by Henry I, and again by Henry II, when he  appointed Justices in eyre) so in the city of London, no one, except the  sheriffs of London could hold pleas of the crown, and an attempt made by  the Barons in 1258 to introduce a justiciar into the Guildhall was  persistently challenged by the citizens.(106)    Even those who stedfastly maintain that in the country the sheriff and  justiciar grew up to be two distinct officers, the one representing local  interest and the other imperial, are willing to allow that in the city of  London such distinction was evanescent. The office of justiciar in the  city was twice granted _eo nomine_ to Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of  Essex, and it is twice mentioned as having been held by one named Gervase,  who (there is reason to believe) is identical with Gervase de Cornhill, a  Sheriff of London in 1155 and 1156; but the office became extinct at the  accession of Henry II.(107)    (M72)    The events which followed Henry's decease afford us another instance of  the futility of all attempts at this early period to settle the succession  to the crown before the throne was actually vacant. The King's nephew,  Stephen of Blois, and the nobility of England had sworn to accept the  King's daughter Matilda, wife of Geoffery of Anjou, as their sovereign on  the death of her father; yet when that event took place in 1135, Stephen,  in spite of his oath, claimed the crown as nearest male heir of the  Conqueror's blood.(108)    There was no doubt of his popularity, whilst Matilda on the other hand  injured her cause by marrying an Angevin. On the continent a bitter feud  existed between Norman and Angevin; in England the Norman had steadily  increased in favour, and England's crown was Stephen's if he had courage  enough to seize it.    Landing on the Kentish coast, his first reception was far from  encouraging. Canterbury and Dover, held by the Earl of Gloucester, refused  to acknowledge him and closed their gates on his approach. Undismayed by  these rebuffs, Stephen pushed on to London, where he was welcomed by every  token of good will. The Londoners had been no party to the agreement to  recognise Matilda as Henry's successor; they had become accustomed to  exercising a right of sharing in the choice of a king who should reign  over them, and they now chose Stephen. \"It was their right, their special  privilege,\" said they, \"on the occasion of the king's decease, to provide  another in his place.\"(109) There was no time to be lost, the country was  in danger, Stephen was at hand, sent to them, as they believed, by the  goodness of Providence. They could not do better than elect him: and  elected he was by the assembled aldermen or eldermen (_majores natu_) of  the City.    Such is the story of Stephen's election as given by the author of the  \"Gesta Stephani,\" one who wrote as an eye-witness of what took place, but  whose statements cannot always be taken as those of an independent  chronicler of events. Informal as this election may have been, it marks an  important epoch in the annals of London. Thenceforth the city assumes a  pre-eminent position and exercises a predominant influence in the public  affairs of the kingdom.(110)    (M73)    From London Stephen went down to Winchester, where he was heartily  welcomed by his brother Henry, recently appointed papal legate. Next to  London, it was important that Stephen should secure Winchester, and now  that London had spoken, the citizens of Winchester no longer hesitated to  throw in their lot with the king. Winchester secured, and Stephen put in  possession of the royal castle and treasury, he returned to London, where  all doubts as to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19807"],[0,"Sketch of Grammar of the Chippeway Languages (#8)"],[1,"ohbahbah mahndahsenahwah, ewh ata[h]    oobeshegadahgoosewenewah, ahgoonwatahtesuwod kagoo    chekekadahmoowod medush azhe quakeskahwod enahka[hka-]    yah wahwazheowening.
