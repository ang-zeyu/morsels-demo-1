Mrs. Yates was a superb \"Medea.\"--Thomas Campbell.      =Mede'a and Absyr'tus.= When Medea fled with Jason from Colchis (in Asia),  she murdered her brother, Absyrtus, and, cutting the body into several  pieces, strewed the fragments about, that the father might be delayed in  picking them up, and thus be unable to overtake the fugitives.        Meet I an infant of the duke of York,      Into as many gobbets will I cut it      As wild Medea young Absyrtus did.        Shakespeare, 2 _Henry VI._ act v. sc. 2 (1591).      =Mede'a's Kettle.= Medea, the sorceress, cut to pieces an old ram, threw  the parts into her caldron, and by her incantations changed the old ram  into a young lamb. The daughters of Pelias thought they would have their  father restored to youth, as AEson had been. So they killed him, and put  the body in Medea's caldron; but Medea refused to utter the needful  incantation, and so the old man was not restored to life.         Change the shape, and shake off age. Get thee Medea's kettle, and       be boiled anew.--W. Congreve, _Love for Love_, iv. (1695).      =M['e]decin Malgr['e] Lui= (_Le_) a comedy by Moli[`e]re (1666). The  \"enforced doctor\" is Sganarelle, a faggot-maker, who is called in by  G['e]ronte to cure his daughter of dumbness. Sganarelle soon perceives  that the malady is assumed in order to prevent a hateful marriage, and  introduces her lover as an apothecary. The dumb spirit is at once  exorcised, and the lovers made happy with \"pills matrimoniac.\"    In 1723 Fielding produced a farce called _The Mock Doctor_, which was  based on this comedy. The doctor he calls \"Gregory,\" and G['e]ronte \"Sir  Jasper.\" Lucinde, the dumb girl, he calls \"Charlotte,\" and Anglicizes  her lover, L['e]andre, into \"Leander.\"      =Medham= (\"_the keen_\"), one of Mahomet's swords.      =Medicine= (_The Father of_), Aretaeos of Cappadocia (second and third  centuries).

When Conrad was taken  captive by the Pacha Seyd, Medora sat day after day expecting his  return, and feeling the heart-anguish of hope deferred. Still he  returned not, and Medora died. In the mean time, Gulnare, the favorite  concubine of Seyd, murdered the pacha, liberated Conrad, and sailed with  him to the corsair's island home. When, however, Conrad found his wife  dead, he quitted the island, and went no one knew whither. The sequel of  the story forms the poem called _Lara_.--Byron, _The Corsair_ (1814).      =Medo'ro=, a Moorish youth of extraordinary beauty, but of humble race;  page to Agramante. Being wounded, Angelica dressed his wounds, fell in  love with him, married him, and retired with him to Cathay, where, in  right of his wife, he became a king. This was the cause of Orlando's  madness.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).         When Don Roldan [_Orlando_] discovered in a fountain proofs of       Angelica's dishonorable conduct with Medoro, it distracted him to       such a degree that he tore up huge trees by the roots, sullied the       purest streams, destroyed flocks, slew shepherds, fired their huts,       pulled houses to the ground, and committed a thousand other most       furious exploits worthy of being reported in fame's       register.--Cervantes, _Don Quixote_, I. iii. 11 (1605).      =Medu'sa= (_The soft_), Mary Stuart, queen of Scots (1545-1577).

It was Megissogwon who sent the fiery fever on man,  the white fog, and death. Hiawatha slew him, and taught man the science  of medicine. This great Pearl-Feather slew the father of Niko'mis (the  grandmother of Hiawatha). Hiawatha all day long fought with the magician  without effect; at nightfall the woodpecker told him to strike at the  tuft of hair on the magician's head, the only vulnerable place;  accordingly, Hiawatha discharged his three remaining arrows at the hair  tuft, and Megissogwon died.       \"Honor be to Hiawatha!      He hath slain the great Pearl-Feather;      Slain the mightiest of magicians--      Him that sent the fiery fever, ...      Sent disease and death among us.\"        Longfellow, _Hiawatha_, ix.

The three chief were Hans  Rosenbl[:u]t (armorial painter, born 1450), Hans Folz (surgeon, born  1479), and Hans Sachs (cobbler, 1494-1574). The next best were Heinrich  von Mueglen, Konrad Harder, Master Altschwert, Master Barthel Regenbogen  (the blacksmith), Muscabl[:u]t (the tailor), and Hans Blotz (the  barber).      =Mej'noun and Lei'lah= (2 _syl._), a Persian love tale, the Romeo and  Juliet of Eastern romance.

He  looked very warm and a little tired, but he was still chuckling as he  scampered across to another hole of Grandfather Chuck's.    By and by something else crawled out of the hole Johnny Chuck had made.  Could it be Reddy Fox?  Where were his white waistcoat and beautiful  red coat?  And was that thing dragging behind him his splendid tail?    He crept out of the hole and then just lay down and panted for breath.  He was almost too tired to move.  Then he began to spit sand out of his  mouth and blow it out of his nose and try to wipe it out of his eyes.  The long hair of his fine coat was filled full of sand and no one would  ever have guessed that this was Reddy Fox.    \"Haw! haw! haw!\" shouted Blacky the Crow.    Then everybody shouted \"Haw! haw! haw!\" and began to roll in the grass  and hold on to their sides once more; everybody but Reddy Fox.  When he  could get his breath he didn't look this way or that way, but just  sneaked off to his home under the big hickory.    [Illustration: Then everybody shouted \"Haw! haw! haw!\"]    And when Old Mother West Wind came with her big bag to take the Merry  Little Breezes to their home behind the Purple Hills, Johnny Chuck  waddled back up the Lone Little Path chuckling to himself, for that  little feeling of discontent was all gone.  He had found that after all  he could do something better than anybody else on the Green Meadows,  for in his heart he knew that none could dig so fast as he.          VII    JOHNNY CHUCK'S SECRET    Johnny Chuck pushed up the last bit of gravel from the hole he had dug  between the roots of the old apple tree in a corner of the Green  Meadows.  He smoothed it down on the big, yellow mound he had made in  front of his door.  Then he sat up very straight on top of the mound,  brushed his coat, shook the sand from his trousers and carefully  cleaned his hands.    After he had rested a bit, he turned around and looked at his new home,  for that is what it was, although he had not come there to live yet,  and no one knew of it, no one but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, who,  peeping between the branches of the old apple tree, had caught Johnny  Chuck at work.  But _he_ wouldn't tell, not jolly Mr. Sun!  Looking  down from the blue sky every day he sees all sorts of queer things and  he learns all kinds of secrets, does Mr. Sun, but he never, never  tells.  No, Sir!  Mr. Sun never tells one of them, not even to Old  Mother West Wind when at night they go down together behind the Purple  Hills.    So jolly, round, red Mr. Sun just smiled and smiled when he discovered  Johnny Chuck's secret, for that is just what the new home under the  apple tree was--a secret.  Not even the Merry Little Breezes, who find  out almost everything, had discovered it.    Johnny Chuck chuckled to himself as he planned a back door, a beautiful  back door, hidden behind a tall clump of meadow grass where no one  would think to look for a door.  When he had satisfied himself as to  just where he would put it, he once more sat up very straight on his  nice, new mound and looked this way and looked that way to be sure that  no one was near.  Then he started for his old home along a secret  little path he had made for himself.    Pretty soon he came to the Lone Little Path that went past his own  home.  He danced and he skipped along the Lone Little Path, and,  because he was so happy, he tried to turn a somersault.  But Johnny  Chuck was so round and fat and rolly-poly that he just tumbled over in  a heap.    \"Well, well, well!  What's the matter with you?\" said a voice close  beside him before he could pick himself up.  It was Jimmy Skunk, who  was out looking for some beetles for his dinner.    Johnny Chuck scrambled to his feet and looked foolish, very foolish  indeed.    \"There's nothing the matter with me, Jimmy Skunk,\" said Johnny.  \"There's nothing the matter with me.  It's just because I've got a  secret.\"    \"A secret!\" cried Jimmy Skunk.  \"What is it?\"    \"Yes, a secret, a really, truly secret,\" said Johnny Chuck, and looked  very important.    \"Tell me, Johnny Chuck.  Come on, tell just _me_, and then we'll have  the secret together,\" begged Jimmy Skunk.    Now Johnny Chuck was so tickled with his secret that it seemed as if he  _must_ share it with some one.  He just couldn't keep it to himself any  longer.    \"You won't tell any one?\" said Johnny Chuck.    Jimmy Skunk promised that he wouldn't tell a soul.    \"Cross your heart,\" commanded Johnny Chuck.    Jimmy Skunk crossed his heart.    Then Johnny Chuck looked this way and looked that way to be sure that  no one was listening.  Finally he whispered in Jimmy Skunk's ear:    \"I've got a new home under the old apple tree in a corner of the Green  Meadows,\" said Johnny Chuck.    Of course Jimmy Skunk was very much surprised and very much interested,  so Johnny Chuck told him all about it.    \"Now, remember, it's a secret,\" said Johnny Chuck, as Jimmy Skunk  started off down the Lone Little Path across the Green Meadows, to look  for some beetles.    \"I'll remember,\" said Jimmy Skunk.    \"And don't tell!\" called Johnny Chuck.    Jimmy Skunk promised that he wouldn't tell.  Then Johnny Chuck started  off up the Lone Little Path, whistling, and Jimmy Skunk trotted down  the Lone Little Path onto the Green Meadows.    Jimmy Skunk was thinking so much about Johnny Chuck's new home that he  quite forgot to look for beetles, and he almost ran into Peter Rabbit.    \"Hello, Jimmy Skunk,\" said Peter Rabbit, \"can't you see where you are  going?  It must be you have something on your mind; what is it?\"    \"I was thinking of Johnny Chuck's new home,\" said Jimmy Skunk.    \"Johnny Chuck's new home!\" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  \"Has Johnny Chuck  got a new home?  Where is it?\"    \"Under the roots of the old apple tree in a corner of the Green  Meadows,\" said Jimmy Skunk, and then he clapped both hands over his  mouth.  You see he hadn't really meant to tell.  It just slipped out.    \"Oh, but it's a secret!\" cried Jimmy Skunk.  \"It's a secret, and you  mustn't tell.  I guess Johnny Chuck won't mind if you know, Peter  Rabbit, but you mustn't tell any one else.\"  Peter Rabbit promised he  wouldn't.    Now Peter Rabbit is very inquisitive, very inquisitive indeed.  So as  soon as he had parted from Jimmy Skunk he made up his mind that he must  see the new home of Johnny Chuck.  So off he started as fast as he  could go towards the old apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows.  Half way there he met Reddy Fox.    \"Hello, Peter Rabbit!  Where are you going in such a hurry?\" asked  Reddy Fox.    \"Over to the old apple tree to see Johnny Chuck's new home,\" replied  Peter Rabbit as he tried to dodge past Reddy Fox.  Then of a sudden he  remembered and clapped both hands over his mouth.    \"Oh, but it's a secret, Reddy Fox.  It's a secret, and you mustn't  tell!\" cried Peter Rabbit.    But Reddy Fox wouldn't promise that he wouldn't tell, for in spite of  his handsome coat and fine manners, Reddy Fox is a scamp.  And,  besides, he has no love for Johnny Chuck, for he has not forgotten how  Johnny Chuck once made him run and called him a \"'fraid cat.\"    So when Reddy Fox left Peter Rabbit he grinned a wicked grin and  hurried off to find Bobby Coon.  He met him on his way to the Laughing  Brook.  Reddy Fox told Bobby Coon all about Johnny Chuck's secret and  then hurried away after Peter Rabbit, for Reddy Fox also is very  inquisitive.    Bobby Coon went on down to the Laughing Brook.  There he met Billy Mink  and told him about the new home Johnny Chuck had made under the old  apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows.    Pretty soon Billy Mink met Little Joe Otter and told him.    Then Little Joe Otter met Jerry Muskrat and told him.    Jerry Muskrat saw Blacky the Crow and told him, and Great-Grandfather  Frog heard him.    Blacky the Crow met his first cousin, Sammy Jay, and told him.    Sammy Jay met Happy Jack Squirrel and told him.    Happy Jack met his cousin, Striped Chipmunk, and told him.    Striped Chipmunk passed the house of old Mr. Toad and told him.    The next morning, very early, before Old Mother West Wind had come down  from the Purple Hills, Johnny Chuck stole over to his new home to begin  work on his new back door.  He had hardly begun to dig when he heard  some one cough right behind him.  He whirled around and there sat Peter  Rabbit looking as innocent and surprised as if he had really just  discovered the new home for the first time.    \"What a splendid new home you have, Johnny Chuck!\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"Y--e--s,\" said Johnny Chuck, slowly.  \"It's a secret,\" he added  suddenly.  \"You won't tell, will you, Peter Rabbit?\"    Peter Rabbit promised that he wouldn't tell.  Then Johnny Chuck felt  better and went back to work as soon as Peter Rabbit left.    He had hardly begun, however, when some one just above him said: \"Good  morning, Johnny Chuck.\"    Johnny Chuck looked up and there in the old apple tree sat Blacky the  Crow and his cousin, Sammy Jay.    Just then there was a rustle in the grass and out popped Billy Mink and  Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat and Happy Jack Squirrel and Striped  Chipmunk and Bobby Coon.  When Johnny Chuck had recovered from his  surprise and looked over to the doorway of his new home there sat Reddy  Fox on Johnny Chuck's precious new mound.  It seemed as if all the  little meadow people were there, all but Jimmy Skunk, who wisely stayed  away.    \"We've come to see your new home,\" said Striped Chipmunk, \"and we think  it's the nicest home we've seen for a long time.\"    \"It's so nicely hidden away, it's really quite secret,\" said Reddy Fox,  grinning wickedly.    Just then up raced the Merry Little Breezes and one of them had a  message for Johnny Chuck from Great-Grandfather Frog.  It was this:    \"Whisper a secret to a friend and you"]]]
