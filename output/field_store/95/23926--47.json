I am tempted to illustrate this by an  anecdote related by Sir Nicholas L'Estrange of Hunstanton, and preserved  in a MS. in the Harlein collection.--\"Dr. Usher, Bish. of Armath, being  to preach at Paules Crosse and passing hastily by one of the stationers,  called for a Bible, and had a little one of the London edition given him  out, but when he came to looke for his text, that very verse was omitted  in the print: which gave the first occasion of complaint to the king of  the insufferable negligence, and insufficience of the London printers and  presse, and bredde that great contest that followed, betwixt the univers.  of Cambridge and London stationers, about printing of the Bibles.\"[54]  Gross and numerous indeed were the errors of the corrupt bible text of  that age, and far exceeding even the blunders of monkish pens, and  certainly much less excusable, for in those times they seldom had a large  collection of codices to compare, so that by studying their various  readings, they could arrive at a more certain and authentic version. The  paucity of the sacred volume, if it rendered their pens more liable to  err, served to enforce upon them the necessity of still greater scrutiny.  On looking over a monastic catalogue, the first volume that I search for  is the Bible; and, I feel far more disappointment if I find it not there,  than I do at the absence of Horace or Ovid--there is something so  desolate in the idea of a Christian priest without the Book of Life--of a  minister of God without the fountain of truth--that however favorably we  may be prone to regard them, a thought will arise that the absence of  this sacred book may perhaps be referred to the indolence of the monkish  pen, or to the laxity of priestly piety. But such I am glad to say was  not often the case; the Bible it is true was an expensive book, but can  scarcely be regarded as a rare one; the monastery was indeed poor that  had it not, and when once obtained the monks took care to speedily  transcribe it. Sometimes they only possessed detached portions, but when  this was the case they generally borrowed of some neighboring and more  fortunate monastery, the missing parts to transcribe, and so complete  their own copies. But all this did not make the Bible less loved among  them, or less anxiously and ardently studied, they devoted their days,  and the long hours of the night, to the perusal of those pages of  inspired truth,[55] and it is a calumny without a shadow of foundation to  declare that the monks were careless of scripture reading; it is true  they did not apply that vigor of thought, and unrestrained reflection  upon it which mark the labors of the more modern student, nor did they  often venture to interpret the hidden meaning of the holy mysteries by  the powers of their own mind, but were guided in this important matter by  the works of the fathers. But hence arose a circumstance which gave full  exercise to their mental powers and compelled the monk in spite of his  timidity to think a little for himself. Unfortunately the fathers,  venerable and venerated as they were, after all were but men, with many  of the frailties and all the fallabilities of poor human nature; the pope  might canonize them, and the priesthood bow submissively to their  spiritual guidance, still they remained for all that but mortals of dust  and clay, and their bulky tomes yet retain the swarthiness of the tomb  about them, the withering impress of humanity. Such being the case we,  who do not regard them quite so infallible, feel no surprise at a  circumstance which sorely perplexed the monks of old, they unchained and  unclasped their cumbrous \"Works of the Fathers,\" and pored over those  massy expositions with increasing wonder; surrounded by these holy  guides, these fathers of infallibility, they were like strangers in a  foreign land, did they follow this holy saint they seemed about to  forsake the spiritual direction of one having equal claims to their  obedience and respect; alas! for poor old weak tradition, those  fabrications of man's faulty reason were found, with all their orthodoxy,  to clash woefully in scriptural interpretation. Here was a dilemma for  the monkish student! whose vow of obedience to patristical guidance was  thus sorely perplexed; he read and re-read, analyzed passage after  passage, interpreted word after word; and yet, poor man, his laborious  study was fruitless and unprofitable! What bible student can refrain from  sympathizing with him amidst these torturing doubts and this crowd of  contradiction, but after all we cannot regret this, for we owe to it more  than my feeble pen can write, so immeasurable have been the fruits of  this little unheeded circumstance. It gave birth to many a bright  independent declaration, involving pure lines of scripture  interpretation, which appear in the darkness of those times like fixed  stars before us; to this, in Saxon days, we are indebted for the labors  of AElfric and his anti-Roman doctrines, whose soul also sympathized with  a later age by translating portions of the Bible into the vulgar tongue,  thus making it accessible to all classes of the people. To this we are  indebted for all the good that resulted from those various heterodoxies  and heresies, which sometimes disturbed the church during the dark ages;  but which wrought much ultimate good by compelling the thoughts of men to  dwell on these important matters. Indeed, to the instability of the  fathers, as a sure guide, we may trace the origin of all those efforts of  the human mind, which cleared the way for the Reformation, and relieved  man from the shackles of these spiritual guides of the monks.    But there were many cloistered Christians who studied the bible  undisturbed by these shadows and doubts, and who, heedless of patristical  lore and saintly wisdom, devoured the spiritual food in its pure and  uncontaminating simplicity--such students, humble, patient, devoted, will  be found crowding the monastic annals, and yielding good evidence of the  same by the holy tenor of their sinless lives, their Christian charity  and love.    But while so many obtained the good title of an \"_Amator Scripturarum_,\"  as the bible student was called in those monkish days, I do not pretend  to say that the Bible was a common book among them, or that every monk  possessed one--far different indeed was the case--a copy of the Old and  New Testament often supplied the wants of an entire monastery, and in  others, as I have said before, only some detached portions were to be  found in their libraries. Sometimes they were more plentiful, and the  monastery could boast of two or three copies, besides a few separate  portions, and occasionally I have met with instances where besides  several _Biblia Optima_, they enjoyed Hebrew codices and translations,  with numerous copies of the gospels. We must not forget, however, that  the transcription of a Bible was a work of time, and required the outlay  of much industry and wealth. \"Brother Tedynton,\" a monk of Ely, commenced  a Bible in 1396, and was several years before he completed it. The  magnitude of the undertaking can scarcely be imagined by those  unpractised in the art of copying, but when the monk saw the long labor  of his pen before him, and looked upon the well bound strong clasped  volumes, with their clean vellum folios and fine illuminations, he seemed  well repaid for his years of toil and tedious labor, and felt a glow of  pious pleasure as he contemplated his happy acquisition, and the comfort  and solace which he should hereafter derive from its holy pages! We are  not surprised then, that a Bible in those days should be esteemed so  valuable, and capable of realizing a considerable sum. The monk,  independent of its spiritual value, regarded it as a great possession,  worthy of being bestowed at his death, with all the solemnity of a  testamentary process, and of being gratefully acknowledged by the fervent  prayers of the monkish brethren. Kings and nobles offered it as an  appropriate and generous gift, and bishops were deemed benefactors to  their church by adding it to the library. On its covers were written  earnest exhortations to the Bible student, admonishing the greatest care  in its use, and leveling anathemas and excommunications upon any one who  should dare to purloin it. For its greater security it was frequently  chained to a reading desk, and if a duplicate copy was lent to a  neighboring monastery they required a large deposit, or a formal bond  for its safe return.[56] These facts, while they show its value, also  prove how highly it was esteemed among them, and how much the monks loved  the Book of Life.    But how different is the picture now--how opposite all this appears to  the aspect of bible propagation in our own time. Thanks to the  printing-press, to bible societies, and to the benevolence of God, we  cannot enter the humblest cottage of the poorest peasant without  observing the Scriptures on his little shelf--not always read, it is  true--nor always held in veneration as in the old days before us--its  very plentitude and cheapness takes off its attraction to irreligious and  indifferent readers, but to poor and needy Christians what words can  express the fulness of the blessing. Yet while we thank God for this  great boon, let us refrain from casting uncharitable reflections upon the  monks for its comparative paucity among them. If its possession was not  so easily acquired, they were nevertheless true lovers of the Bible, and  preserved and multiplied it in dark and troublous times.    Our remarks have hitherto applied to the monastic scribes alone; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#8)"],[1,"tory-teller!\" simpered Miss Peyton; \"just as if I'd  believe such nonsense. Have they got a nice house?\"    \"Beautiful,\" said Dick. \"I haven't seen any like it since I called on  Queen Victoria last year.\"    \"How is the house furnished?\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, \"as near as I can remember, there's diamonds worked  in the carpet, and all the tables and chairs is of gold. They'd be  rather hard to set on if it twan't for the velvet cushions.\"    \"Aint you afraid to tell such stories, Mr. Hunter? Mr. Fosdick, you will  have to talk to your friend.\"    \"I am afraid it wouldn't do much good, Miss Peyton, if you fail to cure  him.\"    \"Mr. Hunter has just been investing in a handsome watch,\" remarked  Clifton, passing his cup for a second cup of coffee.    \"Oh, do let me look at it! I dote on watches,\" said Miss Peyton.    \"Certainly,\" said Dick; and he detached the chain from his button-hole,  and passed the watch across the table.    \"It's a perfect little love,\" said Miss Peyton, enthusiastically. \"Isn't  it, Mrs. Browning?\"    \"It is very beautiful, certainly,\" said the landlady. She could not help  feeling surprised that Dick, who, it will be remembered, had represented  himself at his first visit to be in limited circumstances, and now  occupied one of her cheapest rooms, could afford to purchase an article  which was evidently so costly.    \"Where did you buy it, Mr. Hunter?\" asked another boarder.    \"I did not buy it at all,\" said Dick, deciding to let it be known how it  came into his possession. \"It was given to me.\"    \"Perhaps you'll mention my name to the person that gave it to you,\" said  Mr. Clifton. \"If he's got any more to dispose of in that way, I should  like to come in for one.\"    \"How do you know but it may have come from a _lady_ friend, Mr.  Clifton?\" said Miss Peyton, slyly.    \"How is that, Hunter?\"    \"I haven't had any presents from any of my lady friends yet,\" said Dick.  \"Perhaps I may some time.\"    \"You don't mean anybody in particular, of course, Mr. Hunter?\" said Miss  Peyton.    \"Oh, no, of course not.\"    This conversation may seem scarcely worth recording, but it will serve  to illustrate the character of Dick's fellow-boarders. Miss Peyton was  rather silly and affected, but she was good-natured, and Dick felt more  at home with her than he would have done had she been a lady like Mrs.  Rockwell, for instance. It got to be the custom with Dick and Fosdick to  remain in the parlor a short time after supper, or rather dinner, for  this was the third meal, and Fosdick joined the young lady in singing.  Dick unfortunately had not been gifted by nature with a voice attuned to  melody, and he participated only as a listener, in which capacity he  enjoyed the entertainment.    After breakfast Dick set out for the store as usual. He felt unusually  happy and independent as he walked along. The check in his pocket made  him feel rich. He wondered how it would be best to invest his money so  as to yield him the largest return. He wisely decided to take Mr.  Murdock, the head clerk, into his confidence, and ask his advice upon  this point.    When Dick arrived at the store neither Mr. Gilbert nor Mr. Murdock had  yet arrived. Half an hour later the latter came, and five minutes after  him the book-keeper.    The latter noticed that the morning paper appeared to have been  disturbed, and, glad of any opportunity to find fault with Dick, said,  angrily, \"So you've been reading the paper instead of minding your work,  have you? I'll report you to Mr. Rockwell.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Dick, \"you're very kind. Are you sure I read the  paper? Is there any news missin' out of it?\"    \"You're an impudent boy,\" said the book-keeper, provoked. He wanted to  overawe Dick; but somehow Dick wouldn't be overawed. Evidently he did  not entertain as much respect for the book-keeper as that gentleman felt  to be his due. That a mere errand-boy should bandy words with a  gentleman in his position seemed to Mr. Gilbert highly reprehensible.    \"You're an impudent boy!\" repeated Gilbert, sharply, finding Dick did  not reply to his first charge.    \"I heard you make that remark before,\" said Dick, quietly.    Now there was nothing out of the way in Dick's tone, which was perfectly  respectful, and he only stated a fact; but the book-keeper became still  more angry.    \"Who rumpled that paper?\" he asked.    \"Suppose you ask Mr. Murdock?\" said Dick.    \"Did he come in here?\" asked Gilbert, cooling down, for it was against  Dick that his charge was made, and not against the head clerk. As to the  paper, he really cared nothing.    \"Yes,\" said Dick.    \"Then it's all right. I supposed you had been idling your time over the  paper. Go and ask Mr. Murdock what time it is. I left my watch at home.\"    \"It's half past eight,\" said Dick, drawing out his watch.    Up to this time the book-keeper had not noticed Dick's watch-chain. Now  that his attention was drawn not only to that, but to the beautiful gold  watch which Dick carried, he was not a little surprised.    \"Whose watch is that?\" he asked, abruptly.    \"Mine,\" said Dick, briefly, rather enjoying the book-keeper's surprise.    \"How did you come by it?\"    \"Honestly,\" said Dick.    \"Is it gold, or only plated?\"    \"It's gold.\"    \"Humph! Did you buy it, or was it given you?\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I didn't buy it.\"    \"Did you say it was yours?\"    \"Yes.\"    Gilbert looked at Dick in surprise. Our hero was becoming more and more  an enigma to him. That a boy in Dick's position should have a gold watch  given him, especially now that he had learned from his cousin Roswell  the nature of Dick's former employment, seemed indeed wonderful.    \"Let me look at your watch a minute,\" he said.    Dick handed it to him.    \"It seems to be a very good one,\" he said.    \"Yes,\" said Dick; \"I aint proud. It's as good as I want to wear.\"    \"It looks entirely out of place on such a boy as you,\" said the  book-keeper, sharply.    \"Perhaps it would look better on you,\" suggested our hero, innocently.    \"Yes, it would be more appropriate for me to wear than you. You're not  old enough to be trusted with a watch; least of all with such a good one  as that.\"    \"Perhaps you'd be kind enough to mention it to the one that gave it to  me.\"    \"Whoever gave it to you didn't show much judgment,\" said Gilbert, in the  same pleasant way. \"Who was it?\"    \"It was Mrs. Rockwell.\"    If a bombshell had exploded in the office, it could hardly have taken  Gilbert more by surprise.    \"Who did you say?\" he repeated, thinking his ears might have deceived  him.    \"Mrs. Rockwell,\" said Dick, once more.    The book-keeper could hardly suppress a low whistle.    \"When did she give it to you?\"    \"Last evening.\"    \"Were you up there?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Did Mr. Rockwell invite you?\"    \"Yes.\"    Just then Dick was called away by Mr. Murdock, who had some work for him  to do.    \"There's something mighty queer in all this,\" thought the book-keeper.  \"What Mr. Rockwell can see in that boy, I don't understand. He's an  impudent young rascal, and I'll get him turned off if it's a possible  thing.\"          CHAPTER VII.    A FINANCIAL DISCUSSION.      In the course of the morning Dick called at the Park Bank, and presented  the check which was made payable to himself. His employer had  accompanied him to the bank on a previous day, and introduced him to the  cashier as one who was authorized to receive and pay over money for the  firm. Dick therefore found no difficulty in obtaining his money, though  the fact that the check was made payable to him created some surprise.    \"Your salary seems to be a large one,\" said the teller, as he handed our  hero ten bills of a hundred dollars each.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"my services are very valooable.\"    On leaving the bank, Dick went to the savings bank, and presented his  book.    \"How much do you wish to deposit?\"    \"A thousand dollars,\" said Dick, briefly.    The bank officer looked at him in surprise.    \"How much did you say?\" he repeated.    \"A thousand dollars.\"    \"No nonsense, young man! My time is too valuable,\" said the other,  impatiently.    He was justified in his incredulity, since Dick's deposits hitherto had  been in sums of from one to five dollars.    \"If you don't want to take the money, I can go somewhere else,\" said our  hero, who was now on his dignity. \"I have a thousand dollars to deposit.  Here it is.\"    The bank officer took the money, and counted it over in considerable  surprise.    \"Business is improving,--isn't it?\" he said.    \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"I made all that money in one day.\"    \"If you should want a partner, call round and see me.\"    \"All right. I won't forget.\"    Dick took the bank-book, and, putting it in his inside coat-pocket,  buttoned up his coat, and hurried back to the store. His reflections  were of a very agreeable nature, as he thought of his large deposit in  the savings bank, and he could not help feeling that he had been born  under a lucky star.    Nothing of consequence transpired in the store that day. Dick was  attentive to his duties. He was determined to learn the business as  rapidly as possible, not only because he felt grateful to Mr. Rockwell  for his kindness, but also because he knew that this was the best thing  for his future prospects. Mr. Murdock, who has already been mentioned,  was of service to him in this respect. He was himself an excellent  business man, and very conscientious in the discharge of his duties. He  required the same fidelity of others. He had observed Dick closely, and  was attracted towards him by his evident desire to give satisfaction, as  well as by his frank, open face. He resolved to help him along, more  especially when he saw the manner in which he was treated by the  book-keeper. To tell the truth, Mr. Gilbert was not a favorite with Mr.  Murdock. He understood his business, to be sure, and, so far as Mr.  Murdock knew, kept the books correctly. But personally he was"]]]
