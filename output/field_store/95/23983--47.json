Independent of Rubens and his pupils, we find Rembrandt was  aware of the great advances made in natural representations of objects  by Adrian Brauwer, (several of whose works, by the catalogue given of  his effects, were in his possession;) therefore, as far as transparency  and richness, with a truthfulness of tint, are concerned, Brauwer had  set an example. But in the works of Rembrandt we perceive a peculiarity  entirely his own--that of enveloping parts in beautiful obscurity, and  the light again emerging from the shadow, like the softness of moonlight  partially seen through demi-transparent clouds, and leaving large  masses of undefined objects in darkness. This principle he applied to  compositions of even a complicated character, and their bustle and noise  were swallowed up in the stillness of shadow. If breadth constitutes  grandeur, Rembrandt's works are exemplifications of mysterious sublimity  to the fullest extent. This \"darkness visible,\" as Milton expresses it,  belongs to the great founder of the school of Holland, and to him alone.  Flinck, Dietricy, De Guelder, and others his pupils, give no idea of it;  their works are warm, but they are without redeeming cool tints; they  are yellow without pearly tones; and in place of leading the eye of the  spectator into the depths of aerial perspective, the whole work appears  on the surface of the panel. There are none of those shadows \"hanging  in mid air,\" which constitute so captivating a charm in the great  magician of chiaro-scuro; not only are objects of solidity surrounded  by softening obscurity, but the contiguous atmosphere gives indications  of the influence of the light and shade. To these principles the art  is indebted for breadth and fulness of effect, which constitute the  distinct characteristics between the early state and its maturity--and  to Rembrandt we owe the perfection of this fascinating quality.    We must, nevertheless, always look back with wonder at what was  achieved by Coreggio. Even when painting flourished under the guidance  of Leonardo da Vinci and Giorgione, Reynolds, speaking of this quality  in contradistinction to that of relief, says, \"This favourite quality  of giving objects relief, and which De Piles and all the critics have  considered as a requisite of the greatest importance, was not one of  those objects which much engaged the attention of Titian. Painters of an  inferior rank have far exceeded him in producing this effect. This was a  great object of attention when art was in its infant state, as it is at  present with the vulgar and ignorant, who feel the highest satisfaction  in seeing a figure which, as they say, looks as if they could walk round  it. But however low I might rate this pleasure of deception, I should  not oppose it, did it not oppose itself to a quality of a much higher  kind, by counteracting entirely that fulness of manner which is so  difficult to express in words, but which is found in perfection in the  best works of Coreggio, and, we may add, of Rembrandt. This effect is  produced by melting and losing the shadows in a ground still darker  than those shadows; whereas that relief is produced by opposing and  separating the ground from the figure, either by light, or shadow,  or colour. This conduct of inlaying, as it may be called, figures on  their ground, in order to produce relief, was the practice of the old  painters, such as Andrea Mantegna, Pietro Perugino, and Albert Durer,  and to these we may add the first manner of Leonardo da Vinci,  Giorgione, and even Coreggio; but these three were among the first  who began to correct themselves in dryness of style, by no longer  considering relief as a principal object. As those two qualities,  relief and fulness of effect, can hardly exist together, it is not  very difficult to determine to which we ought to give the preference.  An artist is obliged for ever to hold a balance in his hand, by which  he must determine the value of different qualities, that when some fault  must be committed, he may choose the least. Those painters who have  best understood the art of producing a good effect have adopted one  principle that seems perfectly conformable to reason--that a part may be  sacrificed for the good of the whole. Thus, whether the masses consist  of light or shadow, it is necessary that they should be compact and  of a pleasing shape; to this end, some parts may be made darker and  some lighter, and reflections stronger than nature would warrant. Paul  Veronese took great liberties of this kind. It is said, that being once  asked why certain figures were painted in shade, as no cause was seen in  the picture itself, he turned off the inquiry by answering, 'Una nuevola  che passa,'--a cloud is passing, which has overshadowed them.\"    Before entering more minutely into an investigation of the principles  of Rembrandt with regard to chiaro-scuro, I must again revert to those  of Coreggio. Opie, speaking of the method of this great artist, says,  \"To describe his practice will be in a great degree to repeat my  observations on chiaro-scuro in its enlarged sense. By classing his  colours, and judiciously dividing them into few and large masses of  bright and obscure, gently rounding off his light, and passing, by  almost imperceptible degrees, through pellucid demi-tints and warm  reflections into broad, deep, and transparent shade, he artfully  connected the finest extremes of light and shadow, harmonized the most  intense opposition of colours, and combined the greatest possible effect  with the sweetest and softest repose imaginable.\" Further on, he  remarks--\"The turn of his thoughts, also, in regard to particular  subjects, was often in the highest degree poetical and uncommon, of  which it will be sufficient to give as an instance his celebrated  _Notte_, or painting of the 'Nativity of Christ,' in which his making  all the light of the picture emanate from the child, striking upwards  on the beautiful face of the mother, and in all directions on the  surrounding objects, may challenge comparison with any invention in the  whole circle of art, both for the splendour and sweetness of effect,  which nothing can exceed, and for its happy appropriation to the person  of Him who was born to dispel the clouds of ignorance, and diffuse the  light of truth over a darkened world!\" Now, this work Rembrandt must  have seen, or at least a copy from it, as his treatment of the same  subject, in the National Gallery, indicates; but the poetry is lost, for  it would be impossible to imitate it without a direct plagiarism. It  may, however, have given a turn to his thoughts, in representing many of  his subjects under the influence of night in place of day, such as his  \"Taking down from the Cross,\" by torch light; his \"Flight into Egypt,\"  with the lantern; the \"Burial of Christ,\" &c. While other men were  painting daylight, he turned the day into night, which is one of the  paths that sublimity travels through. The general idea most people have  of Rembrandt is, that he is one of the dark masters: but his shadows  are not black, they are filled with transparency. The backgrounds to his  portraits are less dark than many of either Titian or Tintoret. His  landscapes are not black, they are the soft emanations of twilight; and  when he leads you through the shadows of night, you see the path, even  in the deepest obscurity. As colour forms a constituent part of  chiaro-scuro, I must, in this division, confine myself more particularly  to black and white, both in giving examples from his etchings, and  explaining the various changes he made upon them in order to heighten  the effect. The etching I have here given is the \"Nativity,\" in the  darkest state; in the British Museum there are no less than seven  varieties, and the first state is the lightest. But in order to render  his mode of proceeding more intelligible, I shall explain the progress  of his working. His first etchings are often bit in with the aquafortis,  when the shadows have but few ways crossed with the etching point: these  are often strongly bit in, that, when covered over with finer lines, the  first may shine through, and give transparency. In the next process he  seems to have taken off the etching ground, and laid over the plate a  transparent ground, (that is to say, one not darkened by the smoke of a  candle;) upon this he worked up his effect by a multiplicity of fresh  lines, often altering his forms, and adding new objects, as the idea  seemed to rise in his mind. After which, when the plate was again  subjected to the operation of the acid, the etching ground was removed,  and the whole worked up with the greatest delicacy and softness by means  of the dry needle, to the scratches of which the aquafortis is never  applied. This process it is that gives what is termed the _burr_, and  renders the etchings of Rembrandt different from all others. Now this  _burr_ is produced, not by the ink going into the lines, but by the  printer being obstructed in wiping it off by the raised edge which the  dry point has forced up; for when these lines run through deep shadows,  we often see that they print white, from the ink being wiped off the  top of the ridge.    [Illustration: THE NATIVITY]    This is the foundation of what is called mezzotint engraving, which  I shall notice in another place. By keeping these remarks in mind,  we shall easily perceive how it is that so many variations occur in  impressions from his plates, depending entirely on the direction in  which the printer wiped off the ink--whether across the ridges, or in  the same direction as the lines. Varieties have also arisen from these  ridges wearing away by the friction of the hand; and as Rembrandt's  copper plates, judging from those I have examined, were soft, they soon  wore down. We also find this dark effect given in many of his varieties  by merely leaving the surface"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22693"],[0,"A Book of Myths (#8)"],[1," his heart expressing itself in the song of his lute. The fiercest  beasts of the forest crawled to his feet and looked up at him with  eyes full of pity. The song of the birds ceased, and when the wind  moaned through the trees they echoed his cry, \"Eurydice! Eurydice!\"    In the dawning hours it would seem to him that he saw her again,  flitting, a thing of mist and rising sun, across the dimness of the  woods. And when evening came and all things rested, and the night  called out the mystery of the forest, again he would see her. In the  long blue shadows of the trees she would stand--up the woodland paths  she walked, where her little feet fluttered the dry leaves as she  passed. Her face was white as a lily in the moonlight, and ever she  held out her arms to Orpheus:        \"At that elm-vista's end I trace,      Dimly thy sad leave-taking face,      Eurydice! Eurydice!      The tremulous leaves repeat to me      Eurydice! Eurydice!\"            Lowell.    [Illustration: SWIFTLY HE TURNED, AND FOUND HIS WIFE BEHIND HIM]    For Orpheus it was a good day when Jason, chief of the Argonauts,  sought him out to bid him come with the other heroes and aid in the  quest of the Golden Fleece.    \"Have I not had enough of toil and of weary wandering far and wide,\"  sighed Orpheus. \"In vain is the skill of the voice which my goddess  mother gave me; in vain have I sung and laboured; in vain I went down  to the dead, and charmed all the kings of Hades, to win back Eurydice,  my bride. For I won her, my beloved, and lost her again the same day,  and wandered away in my madness even to Egypt and the Libyan sands,  and the isles of all the seas.... While I charmed in vain the hearts  of men, and the savage forest beasts, and the trees, and the lifeless  stones, with my magic harp and song, giving rest, but finding  none.\"[3]    But in the good ship _Argo_, Orpheus took his place with the others  and sailed the watery ways, and the songs that Orpheus sang to his  shipmates and that tell of all their great adventures are called the  Songs of Orpheus, or the Orphics, to this day.    Many were the mishaps and disasters that his music warded off. With it  he lulled monsters to sleep; more powerful to work magic on the hearts  of men were his melodies than were the songs of the sirens when they  tried to capture the Argonauts by their wiles, and in their downward,  destroying rush his music checked mountains.    When the quest of the Argonauts was ended, Orpheus returned to his own  land of Thrace. As a hero he had fought and endured hardship, but his  wounded soul remained unhealed. Again the trees listened to the songs  of longing. Again they echoed, \"Eurydice! Eurydice!\"    As he sat one day near a river in the stillness of the forest, there  came from afar an ugly clamour of sound. It struck against the music  of Orpheus' lute and slew it, as the coarse cries of the screaming  gulls that fight for carrion slay the song of a soaring lark. It was  the day of the feast of Bacchus, and through the woods poured Bacchus  and his Bacchantes, a shameless rout, satyrs capering around them,  centaurs neighing aloud. Long had the Bacchantes hated the loyal  poet-lover of one fair woman whose dwelling was with the Shades. His  ears were ever deaf to their passionate voices, his eyes blind to  their passionate loveliness as they danced through the green trees, a  riot of colour, of fierce beauty, of laughter and of mad song. Mad  they were indeed this day, and in their madness the very existence of  Orpheus was a thing not to be borne. At first they stoned him, but his  music made the stones fall harmless at his feet. Then in a frenzy of  cruelty, with the maniac lust to cause blood to flow, to know the joy  of taking life, they threw themselves upon Orpheus and did him to  death. From limb to limb they tore him, casting at last his head and  his blood-stained lyre into the river. And still, as the water bore  them on, the lyre murmured its last music and the white lips of  Orpheus still breathed of her whom at last he had gone to join in the  shadowy land, \"Eurydice! Eurydice!\"    \"Combien d'autres sont morts de meme! C'est la lutte eternelle de la  force brutale contre l'intelligence douce et sublime inspiree du ciel,  dont le royaume n'est pas de ce monde.\"    In the heavens, as a bright constellation called Lyra, or Orpheus, the  gods placed his lute, and to the place of his martyrdom came the  Muses, and with loving care carried the fragments of the massacred  body to Libetlera, at the foot of Mount Olympus, and there buried  them. And there, unto this day, more sweetly than at any other spot in  any other land, the nightingale sings. For it sings of a love that  knows no ending, of life after death, of a love so strong that it can  conquer even Death, the all-powerful.      FOOTNOTE:    [3] Kingsley.          APOLLO AND DAPHNE      Conqueror of all conquerable earth, yet not always victorious over the  heart of a maid was the golden-locked Apollo.    As mischievous Eros played one day with his bow and arrows, Apollo  beheld him and spoke to him mockingly.    \"What hast thou to do with the weapons of war, saucy lad?\" he said.  \"Leave them for hands such as mine, that know full well how to wield  them. Content thyself with thy torch, and kindle flames, if indeed  thou canst, but such bolts as thy white young arms can drive will  surely not bring scathe to god nor to man.\"    Then did the son of Aphrodite answer, and as he made answer he laughed  aloud in his glee. \"With thine arrows thou mayst strike all things  else, great Apollo, a shaft of mine shall surely strike thy heart!\"    Carefully, then, did Eros choose two arrows from his quiver. One,  sharp-pointed and of gold, he fitted carefully to his bow, drew back  the string until it was taut, and then let fly the arrow, that did not  miss its mark, but flew straight to the heart of the sun-god. With the  other arrow, blunt, and tipped with lead, he smote the beautiful  Daphne, daughter of Peneus, the river-god. And then, full joyously did  the boy-god laugh, for his roguish heart knew well that to him who  was struck by the golden shaft must come the last pangs that have  proved many a man's and many a god's undoing, while that leaden-tipped  arrow meant to whomsoever it struck, a hatred of Love and an immunity  from all the heart weakness that Love can bring. Those were the days  when Apollo was young. Never before had he loved.    But as the first fierce storm that assails it bends the young, supple  tree with its green budding leaves before its furious blast, so did  the first love of Apollo bend low his adoring heart. All day as he  held the golden reins of his chariot, until evening when its fiery  wheels were cooled in the waters of the western seas, he thought of  Daphne. All night he dreamed of her. But never did there come to  Daphne a time when she loved Love for Love's sake. Never did she look  with gentle eye on the golden-haired god whose face was as the face of  all the exquisite things that the sunlight shows, remembered in a  dream. Her only passion was a passion for the chase. One of Diana's  nymphs was she, cold and pure and white in soul as the virgin goddess  herself.    There came a day when Apollo could no longer put curbing hands on his  fierce longing. The flames from his chariot still lingered in  reflected glories on sea and hill and sky. The very leaves of the  budding trees of spring were outlined in gold. And through the dim  wood walked Daphne, erect and lithe and living as a sapling in the  early spring.    With beseeching hands, Apollo followed her. A god was he, yet to him  had come the vast humility of passionate intercession for the gift of  love to a little nymph. She heard his steps behind her and turned  round, proud and angry that one should follow her when she had not  willed it.    \"Stay!\" he said, \"daughter of Peneus. No foe am I, but thine own  humble lover. To thee alone do I bow my head. To all others on earth  am I conqueror and king.\"    But Daphne, hating his words of passionate love, sped on. And when his  passion lent wings to his feet and she heard him gaining on her as she  fled, not as a lover did Daphne look on deathless Apollo, but as a  hateful foe. More swiftly than she had ever run beside her mistress  Diana, leaving the flying winds behind her as she sped, ran Daphne  now. But ever did Apollo gain upon her, and almost had he grasped her  when she reached the green banks of the river of which her father,  Peneus, was god.    \"Help me, Peneus!\" she cried. \"Save me, oh my father, from him whose  love I fear!\"    As she spoke the arms of Apollo seized her, yet, even as his arms met  around her waist, lissome and slight as a young willow, Daphne the  nymph was Daphne the nymph no longer. Her fragrant hair, her soft  white arms, her tender body all changed as the sun-god touched them.  Her feet took root in the soft, damp earth by the river. Her arms  sprouted into woody branches and green leaves. Her face vanished, and  the bark of a big tree enclosed her snow-white body. Yet Apollo did  not take away his embrace from her who had been his dear first love.  He knew that her cry to Peneus her father had been answered, yet he  said, \"Since thou canst not be my bride, at least thou shalt be my  tree; my hair, my lyre, my quiver shall have thee always, oh laurel  tree of the Immortals!\"    So do we still speak of laurels won, and worn by those of deathless  fame, and still does the first love of Apollo crown the heads of those  whose gifts have fitted them to dwell with the dwellers on Olympus.                    \"I espouse thee for my tree:      Be thou the prize of honour and renown;      The deathless poet, and the poem, crown;      Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn,      And, after poets, be by victors worn.\"            Ovid (_Dryden's translation_).
