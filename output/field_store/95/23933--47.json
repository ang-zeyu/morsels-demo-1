I do not, of course, mean to  say that boys ought deliberately to tumble into ponds or climb trees  until they fall off; but they ought not to avoid the risk of such  mishaps.  They ought to encounter such risks and many others  perpetually.  They ought to practise leaping off heights into deep  water.  They ought never to hesitate to cross a stream on a narrow  unsafe plank _for fear of a ducking_.  They ought never to decline to  climb up a tree to pull fruit merely because there is a _possibility_ of  their falling off and breaking their necks.  I firmly believe that boys  were intended to encounter all kinds of risks, in order to prepare them  to meet and grapple with the risks and dangers incident to man's career  with cool, cautious self-possession--a self-possession founded on  experimental knowledge of the character and powers of their own spirits  and muscles.  I also concluded that this reasoning applies to some  extent to girls as well as boys, for they too are liable through life to  occasional encounters with danger--such as meeting with mad bulls, being  run away with on horseback, being upset in boats, being set on fire by  means of crinoline; in all of which cases those who have been trained to  risk slight mishaps during early life will find their nerves equal to  the shock, and their minds cool and collected enough to look around and  take hasty advantage of any opportunity of escape that may exist; while  those who have been unhappily nurtured in excessive delicacy, and  advised from the earliest childhood to \"take care of themselves and  carefully avoid all risks,\" will probably fall victims to their nervous  alarms and the kind but injudicious training of parents or guardians.    The more I pondered this subject the more deeply impressed did I become  with its great importance to the well-being of mankind, and I was so  profoundly engrossed with it that my companions utterly failed to engage  me in general conversation as we walked briskly along through the  forest.  Jack again and again attempted to draw my attention to the  splendour of the curious specimens of tropical foliage and vegetation  through which we passed; but I could not rouse myself to take interest  therein.  In vain did Peterkin jest and rally me, and point out the  monkeys that grinned at us ever and anon as we passed beneath them, or  the serpents that glided more than once from our path, I was fascinated  with my train of meditation, and as I could not then give it up until I  had thought it out, so now I cannot pass from the subject until I have  at least endeavoured to guard myself from misconception.    I beg, then, that it will be understood that I do not by any means  inculcate hare-brained recklessness, or a course of training that will  foster that state of mind.  On the contrary, the course of training  which I should like to see universally practised would naturally tend to  counteract recklessness, for it would enable a boy to judge correctly as  to what he could and could not do.  Take an illustration.  A naturally  bold boy has been unwisely trained to be exceedingly careful of himself.  He does not know the extent of his own courage, or the power and  agility of his own muscles; he knows these things to some extent indeed,  but owing to restraint he does not know them fully.  Hence he is liable  both to over and under estimate them.    This bold boy--we shall call him Tom--takes a walk into the country with  a friend, whom we shall name Pat.  Pat is a bad boy, but he has been  permitted to train his muscles as he pleased, and his natural  disposition has led him to do difficult and sometimes slightly dangerous  things.    \"You can't jump over that river, Tom,\" says Pat.    \"Perhaps not,\" replies Tom: \"I never tried such a jump, because my  mother tells me never to go where I am likely to tumble into the water.\"    \"Oh, your mother's a muff!\" cries Pat.    \"Pat,\" says Tom, flushing with indignation and confronting his friend,  \"don't you ever say that again, else the friendship between you and me  will come to an end.  I know you don't really mean what you say; but I  won't allow you to speak disrespectfully of my mother.\"    \"Well, I won't,\" says Pat, \"but _you're_ a muff, anyhow.\"    \"Perhaps I am,\" replies Tom.    \"Of course you are, because you're afraid to jump over that river, and  I'm not.  So here goes.\"    Pat thereupon jumps the river (he is a splendid leaper), and Tom  hesitates.    \"Come along, Tom; don't be a hen.\"    Tom gives way, alas! to a disobedient impulse, and dashing at the leap  comes to the edge, when he finds, somehow, that he has not got the  proper foot first for the spring--almost every boy knows the feeling I  allude to; his heart fails, and he balks.    \"O Tom, what a nimini-pimini muff you are, to be sure!\"    Tom, as I have said, is a bold boy.  His blood boils at this; he rushes  wildly at the bank, hurls himself recklessly into the air, barely  reaches the opposite side with a scramble, and falls souse into the  river, from which he issues, as Pat says amid peals of laughter, \"like a  half-drowned rat.\"    Now, had Tom been permitted to follow the bent of his own bold impulses,  he would have found out, years ago, how far and how high he could leap,  and how far exactly he could depend on his own courage in certain  circumstances; and he would either, on the one hand, have measured the  leap with an accustomed eye, and declined to take it with a  good-humoured admission that it was beyond his powers, or, on the other  hand, he would calmly have collected his well and oft tried energies for  the spring.  The proper foot, from long experience, would have come to  the ground at the right time.  His mind, freed from all anxiety as to  what he could accomplish, would have received a beneficial impulse from  his friend's taunt.  No nervous dread of a ducking would have checked  the completeness of his bound, because he would have often been ducked  before, and would have discovered that in most cases, if the clothes be  changed at once, a ducking is not worth mentioning--from a hydropathic  point of view is, in fact, beneficial--and he would have cleared the  river with comfort to himself and confusion to his friend, and without a  ducking or the uneasiness of conscience caused by the knowledge that he  had disobeyed his mother.  Had Peterkin not been trained to encounter  danger, his natural boldness alone would never have enabled him to stand  the charge of that buffalo bull.    There are muffs in this world.  I do not refer to those hairy articles  of female apparel in which ladies are wont to place their hands,  handkerchiefs, and scent-bottles.  Although not given to the use of  slang, I avail myself of it on this occasion, the word \"muff\" being  eminently expressive of a certain class of boys, big as well as little,  old as well as young.  There are three distinct classes of boys--namely,  muffs, sensible fellows, and boasters.  I say there are three distinct  classes, but I do not say that every boy belongs to one or other of  those classes.  Those who have studied chemistry know that nature's  elements are few.  Nearly all kinds of matter, and certainly all  varieties of mind, are composite.  There are no pure and simple muffs.  Most boasters have a good deal of the muff in them, and many muffs are  boasters; while sensible fellows are occasionally tinged with a dash of  both the bad qualities--they are, if I may be allowed to coin a word,  _sensible-boasto-muffers_!  Still, for the sake of lucidity, I will  maintain that there are three distinct phases of character in boys.    The muff is a boy who from natural disposition, or early training, or  both, is mild, diffident, and gentle.  So far he is an estimable  character.  Were this all, he were not a muff.  In order to deserve that  title he must be timid and unenthusiastic.  He must refuse to venture  anything that will subject him to danger, however slight.  He must be  afraid of a shower of rain; afraid of dogs in general, good and bad  alike; disinclined to try bold things; indifferent about learning to  swim.  He must object to the game called \"dumps,\" because the blows from  the ball are sometimes severe; and be a sworn enemy to single-stick,  because the whacks are uncommonly painful.  So feeling and acting, he  will, when he becomes a man, find himself unable to act in the common  emergencies of life--to protect a lady from insolence, to guard his  house from robbery, or to save his own child should it chance to fall  into the water.  The muff is addicted to boasting sometimes, especially  when in the company of girls; but when on the playground he hangs on the  skirts of society, and sings very small.  There are many boys, alas! who  are made muffs by injudicious training, who would have grown up to be  bold, manly fellows had they been otherwise treated.  There are also  many kinds of muffs.  Some are good-hearted, amiable muffs; others are  petty, sneaking muffs.    With many of the varieties I have a strong sympathy, and for their  comfort I would say that muffs may cure themselves if they choose to try  energetically.    Courage and cowardice are not two distinct and entirely antagonistic  qualities.  To a great extent those qualities are the result of  training.  Every courageous man has a slight amount of cowardice in his  composition, and all cowards have a certain infusion of courage.  The  matador stands before the infuriated bull, and awaits its charge with  unflinching firmness, not because he has more courage than his comrades  in the ring who run away, but because long training has enabled him to  make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#8)"],[1,"object  has its merit.  Even the painter of still life, whose highest ambition is  to give a minute representation of every part of those low objects, which  he sets before him, deserves praise in proportion to his attainment;  because no part of this excellent art, so much the ornament of polished  life, is destitute of value and use.  These, however, are by no means the  views to which the mind of the student ought to be _primarily_ directed.  By aiming at better things, if from particular inclination, or from the  taste of the time and place he lives in, or from necessity, or from  failure in the highest attempts, he is obliged to descend lower; he will  bring into the lower sphere of art a grandeur of composition and  character that will raise and ennoble his works far above their natural  rank.    A man is not weak, though he may not be able to wield the club of  Hercules; nor does a man always practise that which he esteems the beat;  but does that which he can best do.  In moderate attempts, there are many  walks open to the artist.  But as the idea of beauty is of necessity but  one, so there can be but one great mode of painting; the leading  principle of which I have endeavoured to explain.    I should be sorry if what is here recommended should be at all understood  to countenance a careless or indetermined manner of painting.  For though  the painter is to overlook the accidental discriminations of nature, he  is to pronounce distinctly, and with precision, the general forms of  things.  A firm and determined outline is one of the characteristics of  the great style in painting; and, let me add, that he who possesses the  knowledge of the exact form, that every part of nature ought to have,  will be fond of expressing that knowledge with correctness and precision  in all his works.    To conclude: I have endeavoured to reduce the idea of beauty to general  principles.  And I had the pleasure to observe that the professor of  painting proceeded in the same method, when he showed you that the  artifice of contrast was founded but on one principle.  And I am  convinced that this is the only means of advancing science, of clearing  the mind from a confused heap of contradictory observations, that do but  perplex and puzzle the student when he compares them, or misguide him if  he gives himself up to their authority; but bringing them under one  general head can alone give rest and satisfaction to an inquisitive mind.        A DISCOURSE  Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution of the  Prizes, December 10, 1771, by the President.      Gentlemen,--The value and rank of every art is in proportion to the  mental labour employed in it, or the mental pleasure produced by it.  As  this principle is observed or neglected, our profession becomes either a  liberal art or a mechanical trade.  In the hands of one man it makes the  highest pretensions, as it is addressed to the noblest faculties, In  those of another it is reduced to a mere matter of ornament, and the  painter has but the humble province of furnishing our apartments with  elegance.    This exertion of mind, which is the only circumstance that truly ennobles  our art, makes the great distinction between the Roman and Venetian  schools.  I have formerly observed that perfect form is produced by  leaving out particularities, and retaining only general ideas.  I shall  now endeavour to show that this principle, which I have proved to be  metaphysically just, extends itself to every part of the art; that it  gives what is called the grand style to invention, to composition, to  expression, and even to colouring and drapery.    Invention in painting does not imply the invention of the subject, for  that is commonly supplied by the poet or historian.  With respect to the  choice, no subject can be proper that is not generally interesting.  It  ought to be either some eminent instance of heroic action or heroic  suffering.  There must be something either in the action or in the object  in which men are universally concerned, and which powerfully strikes upon  the public sympathy.    Strictly speaking, indeed, no subject can be of universal, hardly can it  be of general concern: but there are events and characters so popularly  known in those countries where our art is in request, that they may be  considered as sufficiently general for all our purposes.  Such are the  great events of Greek and Roman fable and history, which early education  and the usual course of reading have made familiar and interesting to all  Europe, without being degraded by the vulgarism of ordinary life in any  country.  Such, too, are the capital subjects of Scripture history,  which, besides their general notoriety, become venerable by their  connection with our religion.    As it is required that the subject selected should be a general one, it  is no less necessary that it should be kept unembarrassed with whatever  may any way serve to divide the attention of the spectator.  Whenever a  story is related, every man forms a picture in his mind of the action and  the expression of the persons employed.  The power of representing this  mental picture in canvas is what we call invention in a painter.  And as  in the conception of this ideal picture the mind does not enter into the  minute peculiarities of the dress, furniture, or scene of action, so when  the painter comes to represent it he contrives those little necessary  concomitant circumstances in such a manner that they shall strike the  spectator no more than they did himself in his first conception of the  story.    I am very ready to allow that some circumstances of minuteness and  particularity frequently tend to give an air of truth to a piece, and to  interest the spectator in an extraordinary manner.  Such circumstances,  therefore, cannot wholly be rejected; but if there be anything in the art  which requires peculiar nicety of discernment, it is the disposition of  these minute circumstantial parts which, according to the judgment  employed in the choice, become so useful to truth or so injurious to  grandeur.    However, the usual and most dangerous error is on the side of minuteness,  and, therefore, I think caution most necessary where most have failed.  The general idea constitutes real excellence.  All smaller things,  however perfect in their way, are to be sacrificed without mercy to the  greater.  The painter will not inquire what things may be admitted  without much censure.  He will not think it enough to show that they may  be there; he will show that they must be there, that their absence would  render his picture maimed and defective.    Thus, though to the principal group a second or third be added, and a  second and third mass of light, care must be yet taken that these  subordinate actions and lights, neither each in particular, nor all  together, come into any degree of competition with the principal; they  should make a part of that whole which would be imperfect without them.  To every part of painting this rule may be applied.  Even in portraits,  the grace and, we may add, the likeness, consists more in taking the  general air than in observing the effect similitude of every feature.    Thus figures must have a ground whereon to stand; they must be clothed,  there must be a background, there must be light and shadow; but none of  these ought to appear to have taken up any part of the artist's  attention.  They should be so managed as not even to catch that of the  spectator.  We know well enough, when we analyse a piece, the difficulty  and the subtlety with which an artist adjusts the background, drapery,  and masses of light; we know that a considerable part of the grace and  effect of his picture depends upon them; but this art is so much  concealed, even to a judicious eye, that no remains of any of these  subordinate parts occur to memory when the picture is not present.    The great end of the art is to strike the imagination.  The painter is,  therefore, to make no ostentation of the means by which this is done; the  spectator is only to feel the result in his bosom.  An inferior artist is  unwilling that any part of his industry should be lost upon the  spectator.  He takes as much pains to discover, as the greater artist  does to conceal, the marks of his subordinate assiduity.  In works of the  lower kind everything appears studied and encumbered; it is all boastful  art and open affectation.  The ignorant often part from such pictures  with wonder in their mouths, and indifference in their hearts.    But it is not enough in invention that the artist should restrain and  keep under all the inferior parts of his subject; he must sometimes  deviate from vulgar and strict historical truth in pursuing the grandeur  of his design.    How much the great style exacts from its professors to conceive and  represent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere  matter of fact, may be seen in the cartoons of Raffaelle.  In all the  pictures in which the painter has represented the apostles, he has drawn  them with great nobleness; he has given them as much dignity as the human  figure is capable of receiving yet we are expressly told in Scripture  they had no such respectable appearance; and of St. Paul in particular,  we are told by himself, that his bodily presence was mean.  Alexander is  said to have been of a low stature: a painter ought not so to represent  him.  Agesilaus was low, lame, and of a mean appearance.  None of these  defects ought to appear in a piece of which he is the hero.  In  conformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting; it  ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is.    All this is not falsifying any fact; it is taking an allowed poetical  licence.  A painter of portraits retains the individual likeness; a  painter of history shows the man by showing his actions.  A painter must  compensate the"]]]
