Mr. Stoddard's sympathies are almost entirely given up to ancient  Grecian art. He can scarcely realize that the dream has passed forever.  He sees something vital in its very ruins. For him the Phidian friezes  yet crown the unplundered Parthenon; the gigantic Athena yet gleams  through sacerdotal incense, in all her ivory whiteness, smiling upon  reeking altars and sacrificing priests; Delphos has yet an oracular  voice; Bacchus and Pan and his Satyrs yet lead their riotous train  through a forest whose every tree is alive with its dryad, and whose  every fountain is haunted by its potamid; there are yet patriot veins to  glow at the Iliad; AEschylus can yet fill a theatre; Pericles yet  thunders at Cimon from the Cema, or woos Aspasia, or tempers the  headlong Alcibiades, or prepares his darling Athens for the  Peloponnesian war. These things Mr. Stoddard feels while the locomotive  shrieks in his ears, while the omnibus, speeding to the steamship,  rattles the glass of his window, while the newsboy cries his monotonous  advertisement, or his servant hands to him a telegraphic dispatch; and  he is right. The body in which Grecian art existed, is indeed dead, but  the spirit which animated it is indestructible. There will be poets to  worship and reproduce it, there will be scholars to admire and preserve  it, when every man's field is bounded by a railway, when every housetop  is surmounted by a telegraph wire, and when the golden calf is again set  up amid the people, to be worshipped as the living God.    From the force of his sympathies, Mr. Stoddard can lean but in that  direction. Throughout his volume there is scarcely a poem which is not  the offshoot of these feelings. Some of them are confessedly upon  Grecian subjects, and all of them are animated by a corresponding  spirit. Even his few domestic poems are not treated after that modern  manner, which moralizes in the last stanza, simply to let the reader  understand how well the poet knows his own meaning. Whatever is  beautiful in Mr. Stoddard's themes is distinctly brought forward, while  the darker side of his subject is scarcely touched upon. Take, for  example, a poem of great simplicity and tenderness, filled with a sorrow  so beautiful as almost to make one in love with grief, and contrast it  with a poem, on a similar subject, by Bayard Taylor:        \"Along the grassy slope I sit,        And dream of other years;      My heart is full of soft regrets,        My eyes of tender tears!        The wild bees hummed about the spot,        The sheep-bells tinkled far,      Last year when Alice sat with me        Beneath the evening star!        The same sweet star is o'er me now,        Around, the same soft hours,      But Alice moulders in the dust        With all the last year's flowers!        I sit alone, and only hear        The wild bees on the steep,      And distant bells that seem to float        From out the folds of sleep!\"        _Stoddard_, _page_ 116.    This is very fine and delicate feeling, softened down to the mildest  point of passion; but it does not at all resemble the frenzy of grief  which follows:        \"Moan, ye wild winds! around the pane,      And fall, thou drear December rain!      Fill with your gusts the sullen day,      Tear the last clinging leaves away!      Reckless as yonder naked tree,      No blast of yours can trouble me.        Give me your chill and wild embrace,      And pour your baptism on my face;      Sound in mine ears the airy moan      That sweeps in desperate monotone,      Where on the unsheltered hill-top beat      The marches of your homeless feet!        Moan on, ye winds! and pour, thou rain!      Your stormy sobs and tears are vain,      If shed for her whose fading eyes      Will open soon on Paradise;      The eye of Heaven shall blinded be,      Or ere ye cease, if shed for me.\"        _Taylor_, _page_ 92.    What a desolation of wo! how the whole man is carried away in one  overwhelming passion! A contrast of the opening poems of these two  volumes, would be a pleasant employment, but their length forbids it.  Mr. Taylor's \"Romance of the Maize\" we have mentioned already; Mr.  Stoddard's \"Castle in the Air\" is its complete antithesis. The latter  poem is a magnificent day-dream, abounding in luscious imagery, and  unrivalled for its minute descriptions of ideal scenery and its  voluptuous music of versification, by any similar creation since  Spenser's \"Bower of Bliss.\"    To sum up Mr. Stoddard's poetical character, he has more fancy than  imagination, he is rather exquisitely sensitive than profoundly  passionate, and oftener works up his feelings to the act of composition,  than seeks it as an outlet for uncontrollable emotion. He thoroughly,  and at every point, an artist. His genius is never allowed to run riot,  but is always subjected to the laws of a delicate, but most severe  taste. His poems are probably planned with views to their artistic  effects, and are then constructed from his exhaustless wealth of  poetical material, by a nice adaptation of each part to the perfect  whole of his design. If he has less imagination than Mr. Taylor, he has  a richer and more glowing fancy; if his figures are less apt and  striking, they are more elegant and symmetrical; if the harmonious  dignity of his versification is less, its melodious sweetness is more;  if he has less passion, he has more sensibility; if moral and physical  grandeur are not so attractive to him, ideal and natural beauty are the  only elements in which his life is endurable. We might pursue these  contrasts to the end of our magazine; but if we have called the reader's  attention to them, we have done enough.    From \"Love and Solitude,\" by Mr. Taylor, we extract the following  picture, in order to contrast it with the handling of the same subject  by Mr. Stoddard in \"The South:\"        \"Some island, on the purple plain      Of Polynesian main,      Where never yet adventurer's prore      Lay rocking near its coral shore:      A tropic mystery, which the enamored deep      Folds, as a beauty in a charmed sleep.      There lofty palms, of some imperial line,      That never bled their nimble wine,      Crowd all the hills, and out the headlands go      To watch on distant reefs the lazy brine      Turning its fringe of snow.      There, when the sun stands high      Upon the burning summit of the sky,      All shadows wither: Light alone      Is in the world: and pregnant grown      With teeming life, the trembling island earth      And panting sea forebode sweet pains of birth      Which never come;--their love brings never forth      The human Soul they lack alone.\"        _Taylor_, _page_ 16.        Half-way between the frozen zones,        Where Winter reigns in sullen mirth,      The Summer binds a golden belt        About the middle of the Earth,      The sky is soft, and blue, and bright,      With purple dyes at morn and night:      And bright and blue the seas which lie      In perfect rest, and glass the sky;      And sunny bays with inland curves        Round all along the quiet shore;      And stately palms, in pillared ranks      Grow down the borders of the banks,        And juts of land where billows roar;      The spicy woods are full of birds,        And golden fruits, and crimson flowers;      With wreathed vines on every bough,        That shed their grapes in purple showers;      The emerald meadows roll their waves,        And bask in soft and mellow light;      The vales are full of silver mist,        And all the folded hills are bright;      But far along the welkin's rim      The purple crags and peaks are dim;      And dim the gulfs, and gorges blue,        With all the wooded passes deep;      All steeped in haze, and washed in dew,        And bathed in atmospheres of Sleep!        _Stoddard_, _page_ 14.    Passages like these say more for their authors than could any  commendation from the critic. Observe how soon mere description is  abandoned by Mr. Taylor, and he begins to put life and feeling into his  scene. The deep is \"enamored,\" the island is \"in a charmed sleep,\" the  palms are \"imperial,\" and \"crowd the hills,\" and \"out the headlands go  to watch the lazy brine,\" &c. All nature is alive. On the other hand,  Mr. Stoddard loves nature for its beauty alone, without desiring in it  any imaginable animation. The man who can read Mr. Taylor's \"Kubla,\"  without feeling the blood dance in his veins, should never confess it,  for he is hardening into something beyond the reach of sympathy. In \"The  Soldier and the Pard,\" a poem of curious originality, Mr. Taylor pushes  his belief in the all-pervading existence of moral nature to its last  extreme. It closes with the following emphatic lines:                    \"And if a man      Deny this truth she [_the Pard_] taught me, to his face      I say he lies: a beast may have a soul!\"    Without drawing too much on the tables of contents, we could not  enumerate the many note-worthy pieces in these volumes; and it would  much exceed our limits to give them even a passing word of comment.  Among Mr. Stoddard's unmentioned poems, the \"Hymn to Flora,\" an \"Ode\" of  delicious melancholy, full of exquisite taste and finely-wrought  fancies, \"Spring,\" \"Autumn,\" a \"Hymn to the Beautiful,\" \"The Broken  Goblet,\" and \"Triumphant Music,\" give the reader a clear insight into  his peculiar characteristics, and open a vision of ideal beauty that no  poet has exhibited in such Grecian perfection since the death of Keats.  A poem, on page 115, is one that awakens peculiar emotions; it describes  a state of half consciousness, when the senses are morbidly alive, and  the perceptive faculties are fettered with dreams, or inspired by a  strange memory that bears within it things not of this world, and hints  at a previous and different existence.        \"The yellow moon looks slantly down,      Through seaward mists, upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#8)"],[1,"des, to visit Athens, and purify their city from pollution and  sacrilege. By performing certain sacrifices and expiatory acts,  Epimenides succeeded in staying the plague.    The civil dissensions however still continued.  The population of  Attica was now divided into three hostile factions, consisting of the  PEDIEIS or wealthy Eupatrid inhabitants of the plains; of the DIACRII,  or poor inhabitants of the hilly districts in the north and east of  Attica; and of the PARALI, or mercantile inhabitants of the coasts, who  held an intermediate position between the other two.  Their disputes  were aggravated by the miserable condition of the poorer population.  The latter were in a state of abject poverty, They had borrowed money  from the wealthy at exorbitant rates of interest upon the security of  their property and their persons.  If the principal and interest of the  debt were not paid, the creditor had the power of seizing the person as  well as the land of his debtor, and of using him as a slave. Many had  thus been torn from their homes and sold to barbarian masters, while  others were cultivating as slaves the lands of their wealthy creditors  in Attica.  Matters had at length reached a crisis; the existing laws  could no longer be enforced; and the poor were ready to rise in open  insurrection against the rich.    In these alarming circumstances the ruling oligarchy were obliged to  have recourse to Solon; and they therefore chose him Archon in B.C.  594, investing him under that title with unlimited powers to effect any  changes he might consider beneficial to the state. His appointment was  hailed with satisfaction by the poor; and all parties were willing to  accept his mediation and reforms.    Solon commenced his undertaking by relieving the poorer class of  debtors from their existing distress.  He cancelled all contracts by  which the land or person of a debtor had been given as security; and he  forbad for the future all loans in which the person of the debtor was  pledged.  He next proceeded to draw up a new constitution and a new  code of laws.  As a preliminary step he repealed all the laws of Draco,  except those relating to murder.  He then made a new classification of  the citizens, distributing them into four classes according to the  amount of their property, thus making wealth and not birth the title to  the honours and offices of the state.  The first class consisted of  those whose annual income was equal to 500 medimni of corn and upwards,  and were called  PENTACOSIOMEDIMNI.  [The medimnus was one bushel and a  half.]  The second class consisted of those whose incomes ranged  between 300 and 500 medimni and were called KNIGHTS, from their being  able to furnish a war-horse.  The third class consisted of those who  received between 200 and 300 medimni, and were called ZEUGITAE from  their being able to keep a yoke of oxen for the plough.  The fourth  class, called THETES, included all whose property fell short of 200  medimni.  The first class were alone eligible to the archonship and the  higher offices of the state.  The second and third classes filled  inferior posts, and were liable to military service, the former as  horsemen, and the latter as heavy-armed soldiers on foot.  The fourth  class were excluded from all public offices, and served in the army  only as light-armed troops.  Solon, however, allowed them to veto in  the public assembly, where they must have constituted by far the  largest number.  He gave the assembly the right of electing the archons  and the other officers of the state; and he also made the archons  accountable to the assembly at the expiration of their year of office.    This extension of the duties of the public assembly led to the  institution of a new body.  Solon created the Senate, or Council of  Four Hundred with the special object of preparing all matters for the  discussion of the public assembly, of presiding at its meetings, and of  carrying its resolutions into effect.  No subject could be introduced  before the people, except by a previous resolution of the Senate.  The  members of the Senate were elected by the public assembly, one hundred  from each of the four ancient tribes, which were left untouched by  Solon.  They held their office for a year, and were accountable at its  expiration to the public assembly for the manner in which they had  discharged their duties.    The Senate of the Areopagus [It received its name from its place of  meeting, which was a rocky eminence opposite the Acropolis, called the  hill of Ares (Mars Hill)], is said by some writers to have been  instituted by Solon; but it existed long before his time, and may be  regarded as the representative of the Council of Chiefs in the Heroic  age.  Solon enlarged its powers, and intrusted it with the general  supervision of the institutions and laws of the state, and imposed upon  it the duty of inspecting the lives and occupations of the citizens.  All archons became members of it at the expiration of their year of  office.    Solon laid only the foundation of the Athenian democracy by giving the  poorer classes a vote in the popular assembly, and by enlarging the  power of the latter; but he left the government exclusively in the  hands of the wealthy.  For many years after his time the government  continued to be an oligarchy, but was exercised with more moderation  and justice than formerly.    Solon enacted numerous laws, containing regulations on almost all  subjects connected with the public and private life of the citizens.  He encouraged trade and manufactures, and invited foreigners to settle  in Athens by the promise of protection and by valuable privileges.  To  discourage idleness a son was not obliged to support his father in old  age, if the latter had neglected to teach him some trade or occupation.    Solon punished theft by compelling the guilty party to restore double  the value of the property stolen.  He forbade speaking evil either of  the dead or of the living.    Solon is said to have been aware that he had left many imperfections in  his laws.  He described them not as the best laws which he could  devise, but as the best which the Athenians could receive.  Having  bound the government and people of Athens by a solemn oath to observe  his institutions for at least ten years, he left Athens and travelled  in foreign lands.  During his absence the old dissensions between the  Plain, the Shore, and the Mountain broke out afresh with more violence  than ever.  The first was headed by Lycurgus, the second by Megacles,  an Alcmaeonid, and the third by Pisistratus, the cousin of Solon. Of  these leaders, Pisistratus was the ablest and the most dangerous.  He  had espoused the cause of the poorest of the three classes, in order to  gain popularity, and to make himself master of Athens.  Solon on his  return to Athens detected the ambitious designs of his kinsman, and  attempted to disuade him from them. Finding his remonstrances  fruitless, he next denounced his projects in verses addressed to the  people.  Few, however, gave any heed to his warnings:  and Pisistratus,  at length finding his schemes ripe for action, had recourse to a  memorable strategem to secure his object.  One day he appeared in the  market-place in a chariot, his mules and his own person bleeding with  wounds inflicted with his own hands.  These he exhibited to the people,  telling them that he had been nearly murdered in consequence of  defending their rights.  The popular indignation was excited; and a  guard of fifty clubmen was granted him for his future security. He  gradually increased the number of his guard and soon found himself  strong enough to throw off the mask and seize the Acropolis (B.C. 560).  Megacles and the Alcmaeonidae left the city.  Solon alone had the  courage to oppose the usurpation, and upbraided the people with their  cowardice and their treachery. \"You might,\" said he, \"with ease have  crushed the tyrant in the bud; but nothing now remains but to pluck him  up by the roots.\" But no one responded to his appeal.  He refused to  fly; and when his friends asked him on what he relied for protection,  \"On my old age,\" was his reply.  It is creditable to Pisistratus that  he left his aged relative unmolested, and even asked his advice in the  administration of the government.  Solon did not long survive the  overthrow of the constitution.  He died a year or two afterwards at the  advanced age of eighty.  His ashes are said to have been scattered by  his own direction round the island of Salamis, which he had won for the  Athenian people.    Pisistratus however did not retain his power long.  The leaders of the  factions of the Shore and the Plain combined and drove the usurper into  exile.  But the Shore and the Plain having quarrelled, Pisistratus was  recalled and again became master of Athens.  Another revolution shortly  afterwards drove him into exile a second time, and he remained abroad  ten years.  At length, with the assistance of mercenaries from other  Grecian states and with the aid of his partisans in Athens, he became  master of Athens for the third time, and henceforth continued in  possession of the supreme power till the day of his death.  As soon as  he was firmly established in the government, his administration was  marked by mildness and equity.  He maintained the institutions of  Solon, taking care, however, that the highest offices should always be  held by some members of his own family. He not only enforced strict  obedience to the laws, but himself set the example of submitting to  them.  Being accused of murder, he disdained to take advantage of his  authority, and went in person to plead his cause before the Areopagus,  where his accuser did not venture to appear.  He courted popularity by  largesses to the citizens and by throwing open his gardens to the poor.  He adorned Athens with many public buildings.  He commenced on a"]]]
