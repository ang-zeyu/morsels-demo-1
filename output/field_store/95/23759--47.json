O children of men! If ye believe in the one True God, follow Me, this Most  Great Remembrance of God sent forth by your Lord, that He may graciously  forgive you your sins. Verily He is forgiving and compassionate toward the  concourse of the faithful. We, of a truth, choose the Messengers through  the potency of Our Word, and We exalt Their offspring, some over others,  through the Great Remembrance of God as decreed in the Book and concealed  therein...    Some of the people of the city have declared: 'We are the helpers of God',  but when this Remembrance came suddenly upon them, they turned aside from  helping Us. Verily God is My Lord and your true Lord, therefore worship  Him, while this Path from 'Ali [the Bab] is none but the straight Path(13)  in the estimation of your Lord. _Chapter III._          \"Unto every people We have sent down the Book in ...\"      Unto every people We have sent down the Book in their own language.(14)  This Book We have, verily, revealed in the language of Our Remembrance and  it is in truth a wondrous language. He is, verily, the eternal Truth come  from God, and according to the divine judgement given in the Mother Book,  He is the most distinguished among the writers of Arabic and most eloquent  in His utterance. He is in truth the Supreme Talisman and is endowed with  supernatural powers, as set forth in the Mother Book...    O people of the city! Ye have disbelieved your Lord. If ye are truly  faithful to Muhammad, the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets, and  if ye follow His Book, the Qur'an, which is free from error, then here is  the like of it--this Book, which We have, in truth and by the leave of God,  sent down unto Our Servant. If ye fail to believe in Him, then your faith  in Muhammad and His Book which was revealed in the past will indeed be  treated as false in the estimation of God. If ye deny Him, the fact of  your having denied Muhammad and His Book will, in very truth and with  absolute certainty, become evident unto yourselves. _Chapter IV._          \"Fear ye God and breathe not a word concerning His ...\"      Fear ye God and breathe not a word concerning His Most Great Remembrance  other than what hath been ordained by God, inasmuch as We have established  a separate covenant regarding Him with every Prophet and His followers.  Indeed, We have not sent any Messenger without this binding covenant and  We do not, of a truth, pass judgement upon anything except after the  covenant of Him Who is the Supreme Gate hath been established. Ere long  the veil shall be lifted from your eyes at the appointed time. Ye shall  then behold the sublime Remembrance of God, unclouded and vivid. _Chapter  V._          \"Do men imagine that We are far distant from the people ...\"      Do men imagine that We are far distant from the people of the world? Nay,  the day We cause them to be assailed by the pangs of death(15) they shall,  upon the plain of Resurrection, behold how the Lord of Mercy and His  Remembrance were near. Thereupon they shall exclaim: 'Would that we had  followed the path of the Bab! Would that we had sought refuge only with  Him, and not with men of perversity and error! For verily the Remembrance  of God appeared before us,(16) behind us, and on all sides, yet we were,  in very truth, shut out as by a veil from Him.' _Chapter VII._          \"Do not say, 'How can He speak of God while in truth ...\"      Do not say, 'How can He speak of God while in truth His age is no more  than twenty-five?' Give ye ear unto Me. I swear by the Lord of the heavens  and of the earth: I am verily a servant of God. I have been made the  Bearer of irrefutable proofs from the presence of Him Who is the  long-expected Remnant of God. Here is My Book before your eyes, as indeed  inscribed in the presence of God in the Mother Book. God hath indeed made  Me blessed, wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon Me to observe  prayer and fortitude so long as I shall live on earth amongst you.  _Chapter IX._          \"Glorified is He besides Whom there is none other God. ...\"      Glorified is He besides Whom there is none other God. In His grasp He  holdeth the source of authority, and verily God is powerful over all  things. We have decreed that every long life shall in truth suffer  decline(17) and that every hardship shall be followed by ease,(18) that  perchance men may recognise the Gate of God as He Who is the eternal  Truth, and verily God shall stand as witness unto those that have  believed. _Chapter XIII._          \"O ye servants of God! Verily, be not grieved if a thing ye ...\"      O ye servants of God! Verily, be not grieved if a thing ye asked of Him  remaineth unanswered, inasmuch as He hath been commanded by God to observe  silence, a silence which is in truth praiseworthy. We have indeed enabled  Thee to truly see in Thy dream a measure of Our Cause, but wert Thou to  acquaint them with the hidden Mystery, they would dispute its truth among  themselves. Verily Thy Lord, the God of truth, knoweth the very secrets of  hearts(19) ...    O peoples of the world! Whatsoever ye have offered up in the way of the  One True God, ye shall indeed find preserved by God, the Preserver, intact  at God's Holy Gate. O peoples of the earth! Bear ye allegiance unto this  resplendent light wherewith God hath graciously invested Me through the  power of infallible Truth, and walk not in the footsteps of the Evil  One,(20) inasmuch as he prompteth you to disbelieve in God, your Lord, and  verily God will not forgive disbelief in Himself, though He will forgive  other sins to whomsoever He pleaseth.(21) Indeed His knowledge embraceth  all things... _Chapter XVII._          \"O Peoples of the East and the West! Be ye fearful of God ...\"      O Peoples of the East and the West! Be ye fearful of God concerning the  Cause of the true Joseph and barter Him not for a paltry price(22)  established by yourselves, or for a trifle of your earthly possessions,  that ye may, in very truth, be praised by Him as those who are reckoned  among the pious who stand nigh unto this Gate. Verily God hath deprived of  His grace him who martyred Husayn, Our forefather, lonely and forsaken as  He was upon the land of Taff [Karbila]. Yazid, the son of Mu'aviyih, out  of corrupt desire, bartered away the head of the true Joseph to the  fiendish people for a trifling price and a petty sum from his property.  Verily they repudiated God by committing a grievous error. Erelong will  God wreak His vengeance upon them, at the time of Our Return, and He hath,  in very truth, prepared for them, in the world to come, a severe torment.  _Chapter XXI._          \"O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! We have, verily, dilated Thine ...\"      O Qurratu'l-'ayn!(23) We have, verily, dilated Thine heart in this  Revelation, which stands truly unique from all created things, and have  exalted Thy name through the manifestation of the Bab, so that men may  become aware of Our transcendent power, and recognize that God is  immeasurably sanctified above the praise of all men. He is verily  independent of the whole of creation. _Chapter XXIII._          \"The angels and the spirits, arrayed rank upon rank, ...\"      The angels and the spirits, arrayed rank upon rank, descend, by the leave  of God, upon this Gate(24) ...' and circle round this Focal Point in a  far-stretching line. Greet them with salutations, O Qurratu'l-'Ayn, for  the dawn hath indeed broken; then proclaim unto the concourse of the  faithful: 'Is not the rising of the Morn, foreshadowed in the Mother Book,  to be near at hand?(25)    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Turn Thou eagerly unto God in Thy Cause, for the peoples  of the world have risen in iniquity, and but for the outpouring of the  grace of God and Thy mercy unto them, no one could purge even a single  soul for evermore.(26) O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! The life to come is indeed far  more advantageous unto Thee and unto such as follow Thy Cause than this  earthly life and its pleasures. This is what hath been foreordained  according to the dispensations of Providence...    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: Verily I am the 'Gate of God' and I give you to  drink, by the leave of God, the sovereign Truth, of the crystal-pure  waters of His Revelation which are gushing out from the incorruptible  Fountain situate upon the Holy Mount. And those who earnestly strive after  the One True God, let them then strive to attain this Gate.(27) Verily God  is potent over all things...    O peoples of the earth! Give ear unto God's holy Voice proclaimed by this  Arabian Youth Whom the Almighty hath graciously chosen for His Own Self.  He is indeed none other than the True One, Whom God hath entrusted with  this Mission from the midst of the Burning Bush. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Unravel  what Thou pleasest from the secrets of the All-Glorious, for the ocean is  surging high(28) at the behest of the incomparable Lord. _Chapter XXIV._          \"Are ye wickedly scheming, according to your selfish ...\"      Are ye wickedly scheming, according to your selfish fancies, an evil plot  against Him Who is the Most Great Remembrance of God? By the righteousness  of God, all who are in the heaven and on earth and whatsoever lieth  between them are regarded in My sight even as a spider's web,(29) and  verily God beareth witness unto all things. Indeed they will not lay plots  but against themselves. God hath caused this Remembrance to be, in very  truth, independent of all the dwellers of earth and heaven. _Chapter XXV._          \"O ye peoples of the earth! During the time of My ...\"      O ye peoples of the earth! During the time of My absence I sent down the  Gates unto you. However the believers, except for a handful, obeyed them  not.

This occupied three days, and at the  end of that time the greater portion of the cargo had been removed.  The ship, now several feet lighter in the water than before, was  brought broadside to shore until her keel touched the ground. Then the  remaining cargo was shifted, and by the additional aid of tackle and  purchases on shore fastened to her masts, she was heeled over until  her keel nearly reached the level of the water.    It was late one evening when this work was finished, and the following  morning the crew were to begin to scrape her bottom, and the  carpenters were to repair the leak, and the whole of the seams  underwater were to be corked and repitched. Hitherto all had remained  on board; but previous to the ship being heeled over, tents  constructed of the sails were erected on the terrace, beds and other  articles of necessity landed, and the passengers, troops, and crew  took up their temporary abode there.        Chapter 4: The Pirates Of The Pacific.      A regular watch was set, both on the plateau and on board ship.  Towards morning, one of the watch on board hailed the officer above:    \"I have fancied, sir, for some time, that I heard noises. It seems to  me like the splash of a very large number of oars.\"    \"I have heard nothing,\" the officer said; \"but you might hear sounds  down there, coming along on the water, before I do. I will go down to  the water's edge, and listen.\"    He did so, and was at once convinced that the man's ears had not  deceived him. Although the night was perfectly still, and not a breath  of wind was stirring, he heard a low rustling sound, like that of the  wind passing through the dried leaves of a forest, in autumn.    \"You are right, Johnson, there is something going on out at sea,  beyond the mouth of the bay. I will call the captain, at once.\"    Captain Thompson, on being aroused, also went down to the waterside to  listen; and at once ordered the whole party to get under arms. He  requested Mr. Barlow, the young lieutenant in charge of the troops, to  place half his men across each end of the plateau. The back was  defended by a cliff, which rose almost perpendicularly from it to a  height of some hundred feet; the plateau being some thirty yards, in  depth, from the sea face to its foot. The male passengers were  requested to divide themselves into two parties, and to join the  soldiers in defending the position against flank attacks. The guns  were all loaded, and the sailors then set to work dragging up bales of  goods from below, and placing them so as to form a sort of breastwork  before the guns along the sea face.    The noise at sea had, by this time, greatly increased; and although it  was still too dark to see what was passing, Captain Thompson said that  he had no doubt, whatever, that the boats had one or more large ships  in tow.    \"Had it not been for that,\" he said, \"they would long ago have been  here. I expect that they hoped to catch us napping, but the wind fell  and delayed them. They little dream how well we are prepared. Did they  know of our fort here, I question whether they would have ventured  upon attacking us at all, but would have waited till we were well at  sea, and then our chance would have been a slight one.    \"Well, gentlemen, you will allow that the two days were not wasted. I  think, now, the pirates are well inside the bay. In half an hour we  shall have light enough to see them.    \"There, listen! There's the splash of their anchors. There, again! I  fancy there are two ships moored broadside on, stem and stern.\"    All this time, the work on shore had been conducted in absolute  silence, and the pirates could have had no intimation that their  presence was discovered. Presently, against the faintly dawning light  in the east, the masts of two vessels could be seen. One was a large  ship, the other a brig. Almost at the same time the rough sound of  boats' keels grounding on the shore could be heard.    \"Just as I thought,\" the captain whispered. \"They have guessed that  some of us will be ashore, and will make a rush upon us here, when the  ships open fire.\"    The word was passed along the guns that every one was to be double  shotted, and that their fire was at first to be directed at the brig.  They were to aim between wind and water, and strive to sink her as  speedily as possible.    As the light gradually grew brighter, the party on the plateau  anxiously watched for the moment when the hull of the Indiaman  becoming plain to the enemy. These would open fire upon it, and so  give the signal for the fight. At the first alarm the tents had all  been levelled; and a thick barricade of bales erected, round a slight  depression of the plateau at the foot of the cliff in its rear. Here  the ladies were placed, for shelter.    As the light increased, it could be seen that in addition to the two  ships were a large number of native dhows. Presently, from the black  side of the ship, a jet of fire shot out; and at the signal a  broadside was poured into the Indiaman by the two vessels. At the same  moment, with a hideous yell, hundreds of black figures leaped to their  feet on the beach, and rushed towards the, as yet, unseen position of  the English.    The captain shouted \"Fire!\" and the twenty guns on the plateau poured  their fire simultaneously into the side of the brig. The captain then  gave orders that two of the light guns should be run along the  terrace, to take position on the flanks, and aid the soldiers against  the attacks.    This time Charlie had lent his rifle to Peters, and was himself armed  with his double-barrel gun.    \"Steady, boys,\" Mr. Hallam, the ensign who commanded the soldiers at  the side where Charlie was stationed, cried; \"don't fire a shot till I  give the word, and then aim low.\"    With terrific yells the throng of natives, waving curved swords,  spears, and clubs, rushed forward. The steep ascent checked them, but  they rushed up until within ten yards of the line of soldiers on its  brow. Then Mr. Hallam gave the word to fire, and the soldiers and  passengers poured a withering volley into them.    At so short a distance, the effect was tremendous. Completely swept  away, the leading rank fell down among their comrades; and these, for  a moment, recoiled. Then gathering themselves together they again  rushed forward, while those in their rear discharged volleys of arrows  over their heads.    Among the defenders, every man now fought for himself, loading and  firing as rapidly as possible. Sometimes the natives nearly gained a  footing on the crest; but each time the defenders, with clubbed  muskets, beat them back again.    The combat was, however, doubtful, for their assailants were many  hundred strong; when the defenders were gladdened with a shout of  \"Make way, my hearties. Let us come to the front, and give them a  dose.\" In a moment two ship's guns, loaded to the muzzle with bullets,  were run forward, and poured their contents among the crowded masses  below.    The effect was decisive. The natives, shaken by the resistance they  had already experienced, and appalled by the destruction wrought by  the cannon, turned and fled along the shore, followed by the shots of  the defenders, and by two more rounds of grape, which the sailors  poured into them before they could reach their boats.    Similar success had attended the defenders of the other flank of the  position, and all hands now aided in swinging round the guns, which  had done such good service, to enable them to bear their share in the  fight with the ships. In the middle of the fight, the party had heard  a great cheer from those working the seaward guns, and they now saw  its cause. The brig had disappeared below the water, and the sailors  were now engaged in a contest with the ship.    The pirates fought their guns well, but they were altogether over  matched by the twenty guns playing upon them from a commanding  position. Already the dhows were hoisting their sails, and one of the  cables of the ship suddenly disappeared in the water, while a number  of men sprang upon the ratlines.    \"Fire at the masts,\" Captain Thompson shouted. \"Cripple her if you  can. Let all with muskets and rifles try to keep men out of the  rigging.\"    The ship was anchored within three hundred yards of the shore, and  although the distance was too great for anything like accurate fire,  several of the men dropped as they ran up the shroud. The sailors  worked their guns with redoubled vigour, and a great shout arose as  the mainmast, wounded in several places, fell over the side.    \"Sweep her decks with grape,\" the captain shouted, \"and she's ours.    \"Mr. James, take all the men that can be spared from the guns, man the  boats, and make a dash for the ship at once. I see the men are leaving  her. They're crowding over the side into their boats. Most likely  they'll set fire to her. Set all your strength putting it out. We will  attend to the other boats.\"    It was evident, now, that the pirates were deserting the ship. They  had fallen into a complete trap, and instead of the easy prey on which  they calculated, found themselves crushed by the fire of a heavy  battery in a commanding position. Captain Thompson, seeing that the  guns of the ship were silent, and that all resistance had ceased, now  ordered the sailors to turn their guns on the dhows and sink as many  as possible. These, crowded together in their efforts to escape,  offered an easy mark for the gunners, whose shot tore through their  sides, smashing and sinking them in all directions.    In ten minutes the last of those that floated had gained the mouth of  the bay and, accompanied by the boats, crowded with the crews of the  two pirate"]]]
