[Illustration: HAD A SORE MOUTH FROM JERKING ON THE LINES.]    When he said that he would not stand it to be driven, a queer little  sound ran through the stalls. It was like the wind passing over a  wheatfield, and was caused by the older Horses taking a long breath and  whispering to themselves. The Bay Colt's mother was saying, \"Poor child!  What hard work he does make of life!\"    The next day both Colts were driven again, and the next day, and the  next, and the next. By this time the Gray Colt was quite used to it. She  said she rather enjoyed knowing what the man was thinking, and that she  could tell his thoughts by the feeling of the lines, much as she used to  understand her mother by rubbing noses when she was a tiny Colt. Her  cousin had a sore mouth from jerking on the lines, and he could not  enjoy eating at all. That made it even harder for him, because he got  very hungry, and it is not so easy to be sensible when one is hungry.    When the Gray Colt learned to walk steadily and turn as her driver  wished, she was allowed to draw a light log through the furrows of a  field. This tired her, but it made her very proud, and she arched her  neck and took the daintiest of steps. It was not necessary that the log  should be drawn over the field; still, she did not know this, and  thought it was real work, when it was done only to teach her to pull.  The man who was driving her patted her neck and held her nose in his  hand. When he stopped to eat an apple, he gave her the core, and she  thought she had never tasted anything so good. As she went back to her  stall, she called to the Horses near, \"I have been working. I have drawn  a log all around a field.\"    The Blind Horse spoke softly to her. \"You will have a happy life, my  dear, because you are a willing worker.\"    Although the Bay Colt didn't say anything, he thought a great deal, and  about many things. While he was thinking he began to crib, but the  noise of his biting teeth on the wood startled him, and he shook his  head and whispered to himself, \"I will never crib again.\" When he ate  his supper, his sore mouth hurt him, but he didn't whimper. \"You deserve  it,\" he said to himself. \"It wouldn't have been sore if you had been  steady like your cousin.\" The Bay Colt was growing sensible very fast.    The Dappled Gray had noticed how suddenly he stopped cribbing, and so  watched him for a few days. He saw that the Bay Colt was in earnest,  that he drew the log up and down without making any fuss, and was soon  hitched with his mother to a plow. The Dappled Gray and the Blind Horse  were also plowing that day, and they called across from their field.  \"Fine day for plowing,\" they said.    \"Perfect,\" answered the Bay Colt. \"Did you notice the last furrow we  turned? Can you do any better than that? If I had jumped, it would have  been crooked instead of straight; and if I had stopped, it would not be  done yet.\"    \"Good furrow! Wonderful furrow!\" answered the Dappled Gray. \"Always knew  you'd be a good worker when you got down to it. You are one of us now,  one of the working Horses. Glad of it. Good-bye!\" And he turned away to  start his plow across the field again.    \"Do you like being grown up?\" said the Bay Colt's mother to him.    \"Like it?\" he answered with a laugh. \"I'm so proud that I don't know  what to do. I wouldn't go back to the old life of all play for anything  in the world. And my little cousin made me see my mistakes. Was there  ever another Colt as foolish as I?\"    \"A great many of them,\" said his mother. \"More than you would guess.  They kick and bite and try to run because they cannot always have their  own way; and then, when they have tried the farmer's way, and begin to  pay for his care of them, they find it very much better than the life of  all play. Colts will be Colts.\"          THE TWIN LAMBS      There was a Lamb, a bright, frisky young fellow, who had a twin sister.  Their mother loved them both and was as kind to one as to the other, but  the brother wanted to have the best of everything, and sometimes he even  bunted his sister with his hard little forehead. His mother had to speak  to him many times about this, for he was one of those trying children  who will not mind when first spoken to.    He did not really mean to be naughty--he was only strong and frisky and  thoughtless. Sometimes he was even rude to his mother. She felt very sad  when this was so, yet she loved him dearly and found many excuses for  him in her own heart.    There were three other pairs of twins in the flock that year, and as  their mothers were not strong enough to care for two Lambs apiece, the  farmer had taken one twin from each pair to a little pen near the house.  Here they stayed, playing happily together, and drinking milk from a  bottle which the farmer's wife brought to them. They were hungry very  often, like all young children, and when their stomachs began to feel  empty, or even to feel as if they might feel empty, they crowded against  the side of the pen, pushed their pinkish-white noses through the  openings between the boards, and bleated and bleated and bleated to the  farmer's wife.    Soon she would come from the kitchen door and in her hand would bring  the big bottle full of milk for them. There was a soft rubber top to  this bottle, through which the Lambs could draw the milk into their  mouths. Of course they all wanted to drink at once, though there was  only a chance for one, and the others always became impatient while they  were waiting. The farmer's wife was patient, even when the Lambs, in  their hurry to get the milk, took her fingers into their mouths and bit  them instead of the top of the bottle.    Our twin Lamb wanted to have his sister taken into the pen with the  other three, and he spoke about it to his mother. \"I know how you can  manage,\" said he. \"Whenever she comes near you, just walk away from her,  and then the farmer will take her up to the pen.\"    \"You selfish fellow!\" answered his mother. \"Do you want your dear little  twin sister to leave us?\"    He hung his head for a minute, but replied, \"She'd have just as good a  time. They have all they can eat up there, and they have lots of fun.\"    [Illustration: FEEDING THE LAMBS.]    \"If you think it is so pleasant in the pen,\" said his mother, \"suppose I  begin to walk away from you, and let the farmer take you away. I think  your sister would rather stay with me.\"    \"Oh, no!\" cried her son. \"I don't want to leave my own dear woolly  mother! I want to cuddle up to you every night and have you tell me  stories about the stars.\"    \"Do you think you love me very much?\" said she. \"You don't know how to  really love yet, for you are selfish, and there is not room in a selfish  heart for the best kind of love.\"    That made the Lamb feel very badly. \"I do love her dearly,\" he cried, as  he stood alone. \"I believe I love her ever so much more than my sister  does.\"    That was where the little fellow was mistaken, for although his sister  did not talk so much about it, she showed her love in many other ways.  If she had been taken from her mother for even a few days, they could  never again have had such sweet and happy days together. Sheep look  much alike, and they cannot remember each other's faces very long. If a  Lamb is taken away from his mother for even a short time, they do not  know each other when they meet afterward. Perhaps this is one reason why  they keep together so much, for it would be sad indeed not to know one's  mother or one's child.    His sister never knew that he had wanted her taken away. She thought he  acted queerly sometimes, but she was so loving and unselfish herself  that she did not dream of his selfishness. Instead of putting the idea  out of his woolly little head, as he could have done by thinking more of  other things, the brother let himself think of it more and more. That  made him impatient with even his mother, and he often answered her quite  crossly. Sometimes, when she spoke to him, he did not answer at all, and  that was just as bad.    His mother would sigh and say to herself, \"My child is not a comfort to  me after all, yet when I looked for the first time into his dear little  face, I thought that as long as I had him beside me I should always be  happy.\"    One night, when the weather was fair and warm, the farmer drove all the  Sheep and Lambs into the Sheep-shed. They had been lying out under the  beautiful blue sky at night, and they did not like this nearly so well.  They did not understand it either, so they were frightened and  bewildered, and bleated often to each other, \"What is this for? What is  this for?\"    The Lambs did not mind it so much, for they were not warmly dressed, but  the Sheep, whose wool had been growing for a year and was long and  heavy, found it very close and uncomfortable. They did not know that the  farmer had a reason for keeping them dry that night while the heavy dew  was falling outside. The same thing was done every year, but they could  not remember so long as that, and having a poor memory is always hard.    \"Stay close to me, children,\" said the mother of the twins. \"I may  forget how you look if you are away long.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said the brother, \"that we always have to stay close  to you. I never have a bit of fun!\"    When they had cuddled down for the night, the twin Lambs slept soundly.  Their mother lay awake for a long, long time in the dark, and she was  not happy. A few careless words from a selfish little Lamb had made her  heart ache. They were not true words either, for during the daytime her  children ran with their playmates and had fine frolics. Still, we know  that when people are out of patience they often say things that are not  really so.

A modern geographer can hardly comprehend such  fancies; those of Greek and Roman times were perfectly familiar with  them. They believed that the Nile communicated with the Red Sea near  Suakin, by means of the Astaboras, and this was certainly the route  which the Egyptians of old had imagined for their navigators. The  supposed communication was gradually transferred farther and farther  south; and we have only to glance over certain maps of the sixteenth  and seventeenth centuries, to see clearly drawn what the Egyptians had  imagined--the centre of Africa as a great lake, whence issued the Congo,  the Zambesi, and the Nile. Arab merchants of the Middle Ages believed  that a resolute man could pass from Alexandria or Cairo to the land of  the Zindjes and the Indian Ocean by rising from river to river.[*]         * Joinville has given a special chapter to the description       of the sources and wonders of the Nile, in which he believed       as firmly as in an article of his creed. As late as the       beginning of the seventeenth century, Wendelinus devoted       part of his _Admiranda Nili_ to proving that the river did       not rise in the earthly Paradise. At Gurnah, forty years       ago, Rhind picked up a legend which stated that the Nile       flows down from the sky.    [Illustration: 027.jpg SOUTH AFRICA AND THE SOURCES OF THE NILE, BY  ODOAKDO LOPEZ. 1]         1 Facsimile of the map published by Kircher in _OEdipus       AEgyptiacus_, vol. i. (_Iconismus II_), p. 53.    Many of the legends relating to this subject are lost, while others  have been collected and embellished with fresh features by Jewish and  Christian theologians. The Nile was said to have its source in Paradise,  to traverse burning regions inaccessible to man, and afterwards to fall  into a sea whence it made its way to Egypt. Sometimes it carried down  from its celestial sources branches and fruits unlike any to be found  on earth. The sea mentioned in all these tales is perhaps a less  extravagant invention than we are at first inclined to think. A lake,  nearly as large as the Victoria Nyanza, once covered the marshy plain  where the Bahr el-Abiad unites with the Sobat, and with the Bahr  el-Ghazal. Alluvial deposits have filled up all but its deepest  depression, which is known as Birket Nu; but, in ages preceding our era,  it must still have been vast enough to suggest to Egyptian soldiers and  boatmen the idea of an actual sea, opening into the Indian Ocean.  The mountains, whose outline was vaguely seen far to southward on the  further shores, doubtless contained within them its mysterious source.  There the inundation was made ready, and there it began upon a fixed  day. The celestial Nile had its periodic rise and fall, on which those  of the earthly Nile depended. Every year, towards the middle of June,  Isis, mourning for Osiris, let fall into it one of the tears which she  shed over her brother, and thereupon the river swelled and descended  upon earth. Isis has had no devotees for centuries, and her very name is  unknown to the descendants of her worshippers; but the tradition of her  fertilizing tears has survived her memory. Even to this day, every one  in Egypt, Mussulman or Christian, knows that a divine drop falls from  heaven during the night between the 17th and 18th of June, and forthwith  brings about the rise of the Nile. Swollen by the rains which fall  in February over the region of the Great Lakes, the White Nile rushes  northward, sweeping before it the stagnant sheets of water left by the  inundation of the previous year. On the left, the Bahr el-Ghazal brings  it the overflow of the ill-defined basin stretching between Darfur and  the Congo; and the Sobat pours in on the right a tribute from the rivers  which furrow the southern slopes of the Abyssinian mountains. The first  swell passes Khartum by the end of April, and raises the water-level  there by about a foot, then it slowly makes its way through Nubia, and  dies away in Egypt at the beginning of June. Its waters, infected  by half-putrid organic matter from the equatorial swamps, are not  completely freed from it even in the course of this long journey, but  keep a greenish tint as far as the Delta. They are said to be poisonous,  and to give severe pains in the bladder to any who may drink them. I am  bound to say that every June, for five years, I drank this green water  from the Nile itself, without taking any other precaution than the usual  one of filtering it through a porous jar. Neither I, nor the many people  living with me, ever felt the slightest inconvenience from it. Happily,  this _Green Nile_ does not last long, but generally flows away in three  or four days, and is only the forerunner of the real flood. The melting  of the snows and the excessive spring rains having suddenly swollen the  torrents which rise in the central plateau of Abyssinia, the Blue Nile,  into which they flow, rolls so impetuously towards the plain that, when  its waters reach Khartum in the middle of May, they refuse to mingle  with those of the White Nile, and do not lose their peculiar colour  before reaching the neighbourhood of Abu Hamed, three hundred miles  below. From that time the height of the Nile increases rapidly day  by day. The river, constantly reinforced by floods following one upon  another from the Great Lakes and from Abyssinia, rises in furious  bounds, and would become a devastating torrent were its rage not checked  by the Nubian cataracts. Here six basins, one above another, in which  the water collects, check its course, and permit it to flow thence only  as a partially filtered and moderated stream. It is signalled at Syene  towards the 8th of June, at Cairo by the 17th to the 20th, and there its  birth is officially celebrated during the \"Night of the Drop.\" Two  days later it reaches the Delta, just in time to save the country from  drought and sterility. Egypt, burnt up by the Khamsin, a west wind  blowing continuously for fifty days, seems nothing more than an  extension of the desert. The trees are covered and choked by a layer of  grey dust. About the villages, meagre and laboriously watered patches  of vegetables struggle for life, while some show of green still  lingers along the canals and in hollows whence all moisture has not  yet evaporated. The plain lies panting in the sun--naked, dusty, and  ashen--scored with intersecting cracks as far as eye can see. The Nile  is only half its usual width, and holds not more than a twentieth of  the volume of water which is borne down in October. It has at first hard  work to recover its former bed, and attains it by such subtle gradations  that the rise is scarcely noted. It is, however, continually gaining  ground; here a sandbank is covered, there an empty channel is filled,  islets are outlined where there was a continuous beach, a new stream  detaches itself and gains the old shore. The first contact is disastrous  to the banks; their steep sides, disintegrated and cracked by the heat,  no longer offer any resistance to the current, and fall with a crash, in  lengths of a hundred yards and more.    [Illustration: 31.jpg DURING THE INUNDATION]    As the successive floods grow stronger and are more heavily charged with  mud, the whole mass of water becomes turbid and changes colour. In eight  or ten days it has turned from greyish blue to dark red, occasionally of  so intense a colour as to look like newly shed blood. The \"Red Nile\" is  not unwholesome like the \"Green Nile,\" and the suspended mud to which  it owes its suspicious appearance deprives the water of none of its  freshness and lightness. It reaches its full height towards the 15th  of July; but the dykes which confine it, and the barriers constructed  across the mouths of canals, still prevent it from overflowing. The Nile  must be considered high enough to submerge the land adequately before  it is set free. The ancient Egyptians measured its height by cubits of  twenty-one and a quarter inches. At fourteen cubits, they pronounced it  an excellent Nile; below thirteen, or above fifteen, it was accounted  insufficient or excessive, and in either case meant famine, and perhaps  pestilence at hand. To this day the natives watch its advance with the  same anxious eagerness; and from the 3rd of July, public criers, walking  the streets of Cairo, announce each morning what progress it has made  since evening. More or less authentic traditions assert that the prelude  to the opening of the canals, in the time of the Pharaohs, was  the solemn casting to the waters of a young girl decked as for her  bridal--the \"Bride of the Nile.\" Even after the Arab conquest, the  irruption of the river into the bosom of the land was still considered  as an actual marriage; the contract was drawn up by a cadi, and  witnesses confirmed its consummation with the most fantastic formalities  of Oriental ceremonial. It is generally between the 1st and 16th of July  that it is decided to break through the dykes. When that proceeding has  been solemnly accomplished in state, the flood still takes several days  to fill the canals, and afterwards spreads over the low lands, advancing  little by little to the very edge of the desert. Egypt is then one sheet  of turbid water spreading between two lines of rock and sand, flecked  with green and black spots where there are towns or where the ground  rises, and divided into irregular compartments by raised roads  connecting the villages. In Nubia the river attains its greatest height  towards the end of August; at Cairo and in the Delta not until three  weeks or a month later. For about eight days it remains stationary, and  then begins to fall imperceptibly. Sometimes there is a new freshet  in October, and the river again increases in height. But the rise is  unsustained; once more it falls as rapidly as it rose, and by December  the river has completely"]]]
