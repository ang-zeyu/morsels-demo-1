It is why they have  black wings and tails, why they flutter so with joy, and why they never  finish their song.          WHAT THE ASH AND THE MAPLE LEARNED      Long ago, birds, trees, animals, and men knew each the language of the  other, and all could talk together.    In those days, the trees of the forest grew very large and strong. At  last they came to know their strength too well. They became selfish, and  proud, and quarrelsome. Each tree boasted that he was the greatest and  strongest. Each one struggled to gain for himself the most earth, the  best air, the brightest sun. No tree had a thought for the other.    One day the trunk of a great Maple tried to crowd out an Ash. The Ash,  of course, thought he had as much right to stand there as the Maple, and  he said he would not stir a limb.    \"Get out of my way,\" cried the Maple. \"I am greater than you, and of  more use to man; for I furnish the sweet water for him to drink.\"    \"Indeed, I will not!\" said the Ash. \"I am greater than you, and of more  use to man than you; for I furnish the tough wood from which he makes  his bow.\"    At this the trees fell to wrestling. Back and forth, in and out they  swayed, each trying to throw the other. They forgot that they were  brothers in the wood.    Then the South Wind came along. He heard the loud voices and stopped to  find out what the quarrel was about.    \"I am greater than you, for I furnish the sweet water for man to drink,\"  came the angry voice of the Maple, as he threw his huge trunk against  the Ash.    \"No, you are not,\" retorted the Ash, and he sent the Maple back with a  great push of his strong elbow. \"I am greater than you, for I furnish  the tough wood from which he makes his bow.\"    [Illustration]    For a time, the South Wind watched them writhe and twist and try to  throw each other to the ground. Then he said, softly, \"You, O Maple, do  not cause the sweet water to flow for man; nor do you, O Ash, make your  wood to grow pliant and tough for his bow.\"    \"Who does, then?\" they asked defiantly.    \"Listen,\" said the South Wind, \"and you shall hear.\"    Then the Maple and Ash forgot their quarrel. They bent their heads so  low and close to listen, that an arm of the Maple slipped through an arm  of the Ash.    [Illustration]    And as they stood thus listening, each with an arm locked in an arm of  the other, the South Wind gently swayed them to and fro. Then a voice  was heard, singing, \"_San noh-eh! San noh-eh! San noh-eh!_\" which  means, \"The Mother of all things.\"    Thus it was that the Ash and the Maple learned that it was Mother Earth  who gave them their life, and power, and strength, and that they were  brothers, because they had one Mother.    The Ash and the Maple whispered the secret to the birds. The birds came  and listened to the voice, and went and told the animals. The animals  came and listened, and went and told men. And thus all the earth  children learned that there is one Great Mother of every living thing,  and that all are brothers.    And now, whenever two trees lock arms lovingly, and the South Wind sways  them gently to and fro, that same voice may be heard, singing, \"_San  noh-eh! San noh-eh! San noh-eh!_\"          HOW THE WOMAN OVERCAME THE BEAR      An Indian woman built a wigwam in the deep wood. She was a brave woman.  She had no fear.    One night, she heard something coming along the trail. Thump, thump,  thump, it came, to the very door of her wigwam.    There was a rap.    \"Come in,\" said the woman, but no one entered.    Again there came a rap.    Again the woman called, \"Come in.\" Again the latch was not lifted.    A third time the rap came. A third time the woman called, \"Come in,\" but  no one entered.    Then the strange thump, thump, thump, was heard going down the trail.    The next night, the same thing occurred. Soon after dark, the woman  heard the thump, thump, thump, coming along the trail. Up to the very  door of the wigwam it came.    Three times, a rap, rap, rap, was heard as before. Three times the woman  answered, \"Come in,\" but no one entered.    Then the same strange thump, thump, thump, was heard going down the  trail again.    The third night, the woman thought she would make sure who was calling.  She stood for a long time, with her hand on the latch.    At last she heard the visitor coming. Thump, thump, thump, it came along  the trail. There were three raps.    \"Come in,\" called the woman, but the latch did not move in her hand. She  waited. Again came the raps.    This time she threw wide open the door, and there stood a great black  bear. He showed his sharp teeth and growled, \"Are you at home?\"    The woman looked him straight in the eye and replied, \"I am at home.\"    At once the bear turned on his heel and went down the trail, as fast as  he could go.    Never again did the woman hear that strange thump, thump, thump; and  never again did the bear call to see if she were at home.    [Illustration]          WHY THE WOODPECKER BORES FOR ITS FOOD      Once upon a time, the Great Spirit left the Happy Hunting Ground and  came to earth. He took the form of a poor, hungry man. He went from  wigwam to wigwam, asking for food.    Sometimes he found the Indians sitting around the fire, telling stories  and talking of the Great Spirit. Then the man would pass by unseen.    One day, he came to a wigwam in which a woman was baking cakes.    \"I am very hungry,\" the man said. \"Will you please give me a cake?\"    The woman looked at the man, and then at the cake. She saw that it was  too large to give away.    She said, \"I will not give you this cake, but I will bake you one, if  you will wait.\"    The hungry man said, \"I will wait.\"    [Illustration]    Then the woman took a small piece of dough and made it into a cake and  baked it. But when she took this cake from the coals, it was larger than  the first.    Again the woman looked at her cake. Again she saw it was too large to  give away. Again she said, \"I will not give you this one, but I will  bake you one, if you will wait.\"    Again the man said, \"I will wait.\"    This time the woman took a very, very, tiny bit of dough, and made it  into a cake.    \"Surely, this will be small enough to give away,\" she thought, yet when  baked it was larger than both the others.    The woman stood and looked at the three cakes. Each was too large to  give away.    \"I will not give you any of the cakes,\" she said to the man. \"Go to the  woods, and find your food in the bark of trees.\"    Then the man stood up and threw off his ragged blanket and worn  moccasins. His face shone like the sun, and he was very beautiful. The  woman shrank into the shadow of the wigwam. She could not look upon his  face, for the light.    \"I am the Great Spirit,\" said he, \"and you are a selfish woman. Women  should be kind, and generous, and unselfish. You shall no longer be a  woman and live in a warm wigwam, with plenty of cakes to bake. _You_  shall go to the forest and hunt _your_ food in the bark of trees. Summer  and winter, you shall eat worms of the same size as the cake you would  have made for me.\"    The woman began to grow smaller and smaller. Feathers grew upon her  body, and wings sprang from it. The Great Spirit touched her head, and  it became red.    [Illustration]    \"Always shall you wear this red hood,\" he said, \"as a mark of your  shame. Always shall you hide from man. Always shall you hunt for little  worms, the size of the cake you made for me.\"    At this a sharp cry was heard, and a bird flew into the fireplace of the  wigwam, and up the chimney. As it passed out of the chimney, the soot  left those long streaks of black which we see now on the woodpecker's  back.    Ever since then, this woodpecker has had a red head, and has been hiding  from man on the farther side of the tree trunk, and boring in the bark  for _little_ worms.          WHY THE ICE ROOF FELL      A great many winters ago, there lived at the foot of a certain lake a  tribe of wicked Indians. These Indians were so fierce, and warlike, and  wasteful, they went about destroying everything.    They laid low a tract of beautiful forest trees, for no good purpose.  They tore up shrubs and plants that gave them food and medicine. They  shot their arrows into every bird or animal they saw, just for sport.    [Illustration]    The great trees--their silent brothers of the wood--trembled and sighed  when they heard these Indians coming. The squirrels darted into hollow  trees, and birds flew in alarm at their footsteps. The deer and rabbit  ran from the trail.    At last the Great Spirit became very angry with this tribe. Always he  had taught the Indians never to kill an animal, unless for food and  protection; never to fell a tree, unless for fuel or shelter; never to  dig up shrubs or plants, unless for some good use.    \"All life,\" the Great Spirit had said, \"is sacred and beautiful. It must  not be wasted.\"    And never before had he known the Indians to waste the beautiful living  things about them. The Great Spirit was very sad.    The ice formed very thick on the lake that winter.    One night, there came a great storm of wind and rain. The ice broke  loose from the shores, and the wind blew it down the lake. At the foot  of the lake, a mass of ice was piled high over the shore, where lived  these wasteful Indians.    Like a giant roof, the ice spread over the little Indian village lying  there asleep, but the Indians did not know. They slept on, unaware of  their danger, for a deep, heavy sleep had come upon them.    Just as the sun rose, the ice roof gave way and fell upon the sleeping  Indians, crushing them in their wigwams.    The waste they had brought upon their brothers of the wood had brought  punishment upon them. The Great Spirit had destroyed these wicked  Indians, that the good Indians might keep his world beautiful.    Ever after, as long as the Indians occupied the country, before the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/221"],[0,"The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#8)"],[1,"ss, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.\"    \"As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a criminal  is often flurried and does things which a cool man would avoid. He was  very likely afraid to go back to the room. Give me another theory that  would fit the facts.\"    \"I could very easily give you half-a-dozen,\" said Holmes. \"Here, for  example, is a very possible and even probable one. I make you a free  present of it. The older man is showing documents which are of evident  value. A passing tramp sees them through the window, the blind of which  is only half down. Exit the solicitor. Enter the tramp! He seizes a  stick, which he observes there, kills Oldacre, and departs after burning  the body.\"    \"Why should the tramp burn the body?\"    \"For the matter of that why should McFarlane?\"    \"To hide some evidence.\"    \"Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been  committed.\"    \"And why did the tramp take nothing?\"    \"Because they were papers that he could not negotiate.\"    Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was less  absolutely assured than before.    \"Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while you  are finding him we will hold on to our man. The future will show which  is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes: that so far as we know  none of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the one man in  the world who had no reason for removing them, since he was heir-at-law  and would come into them in any case.\"    My friend seemed struck by this remark.    \"I don't mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly  in favour of your theory,\" said he. \"I only wish to point out that there  are other theories possible. As you say, the future will decide. Good  morning! I dare say that in the course of the day I shall drop in at  Norwood and see how you are getting on.\"    When the detective departed my friend rose and made his preparations  for the day's work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task  before him.    \"My first movement, Watson,\" said he, as he bustled into his frock-coat,  \"must, as I said, be in the direction of Blackheath.\"    \"And why not Norwood?\"    \"Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the  heels of another singular incident. The police are making the mistake of  concentrating their attention upon the second, because it happens to  be the one which is actually criminal. But it is evident to me that the  logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some  light upon the first incident--the curious will, so suddenly made, and  to so unexpected an heir. It may do something to simplify what followed.  No, my dear fellow, I don't think you can help me. There is no prospect  of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. I trust  that when I see you in the evening I will be able to report that I have  been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster who has thrown  himself upon my protection.\"    It was late when my friend returned, and I could see by a glance at his  haggard and anxious face that the high hopes with which he had started  had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away upon his violin,  endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. At last he flung down  the instrument and plunged into a detailed account of his misadventures.    \"It's all going wrong, Watson--all as wrong as it can go. I kept a bold  face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once the  fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my instincts  are one way and all the facts are the other, and I much fear that  British juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when  they will give the preference to my theories over Lestrade's facts.\"    \"Did you go to Blackheath?\"    \"Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late  lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable black-guard. The father was  away in search of his son. The mother was at home--a little, fluffy,  blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. Of course, she  would not admit even the possibility of his guilt. But she would not  express either surprise or regret over the fate of Oldacre. On  the contrary, she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was  unconsciously considerably strengthening the case of the police, for,  of course, if her son had heard her speak of the man in this fashion it  would predispose him towards hatred and violence. 'He was more like a  malignant and cunning ape than a human being,' said she, 'and he always  was, ever since he was a young man.'    \"'You knew him at that time?' said I.    \"'Yes, I knew him well; in fact, he was an old suitor of mine. Thank  Heaven that I had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a better,  if a poorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes, when I heard a  shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was  so horrified at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing more to  do with him.' She rummaged in a bureau, and presently she produced a  photograph of a woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife.  'That is my own photograph,' she said. 'He sent it to me in that state,  with his curse, upon my wedding morning.'    \"'Well,' said I, 'at least he has forgiven you now, since he has left  all his property to your son.'    \"'Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre, dead or alive,'  she cried, with a proper spirit. 'There is a God in Heaven, Mr. Holmes,  and that same God who has punished that wicked man will show in His own  good time that my son's hands are guiltless of his blood.'    \"Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which would  help our hypothesis, and several points which would make against it. I  gave it up at last and off I went to Norwood.    \"This place, Deep Dene House, is a big modern villa of staring brick,  standing back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front  of it. To the right and some distance back from the road was the  timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire. Here's a rough plan on  a leaf of my note-book. This window on the left is the one which opens  into Oldacre's room. You can look into it from the road, you see. That  is about the only bit of consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade was  not there, but his head constable did the honours. They had just made a  great treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the ashes  of the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains they  had secured several discoloured metal discs. I examined them with  care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons. I even  distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of 'Hyams,' who  was Oldacre's tailor. I then worked the lawn very carefully for signs  and traces, but this drought has made everything as hard as iron.  Nothing was to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged  through a low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood-pile. All  that, of course, fits in with the official theory. I crawled about the  lawn with an August sun on my back, but I got up at the end of an hour  no wiser than before.    \"Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom and examined that also.  The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and discolorations, but  undoubtedly fresh. The stick had been removed, but there also the marks  were slight. There is no doubt about the stick belonging to our client.  He admits it. Footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet,  but none of any third person, which again is a trick for the other  side. They were piling up their score all the time and we were at a  standstill.    \"Only one little gleam of hope did I get--and yet it amounted to  nothing. I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had been  taken out and left on the table. The papers had been made up into sealed  envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the police. They were  not, so far as I could judge, of any great value, nor did the bank-book  show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances. But it  seemed to me that all the papers were not there. There were allusions to  some deeds--possibly the more valuable--which I could not find. This, of  course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade's argument  against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would  shortly inherit it?    \"Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent, I tried  my luck with the housekeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her name, a little,  dark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes. She could tell  us something if she would--I am convinced of it. But she was as close as  wax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane in at half-past nine. She wished  her hand had withered before she had done so. She had gone to bed at  half-past ten. Her room was at the other end of the house, and she could  hear nothing of what passed. Mr. McFarlane had left his hat, and to the  best of her belief his stick, in the hall. She had been awakened by the  alarm of fire. Her poor, dear master had certainly been murdered. Had he  any enemies? Well, every man had enemies, but Mr. Oldacre kept himself  very much to himself, and only met people in the way of business. She  had seen the buttons, and was sure that they belonged to the clothes  which he had worn last night. The wood-pile was very dry, for it had not  rained for a month. It burned like tinder, and by the time she reached  the spot nothing could be seen but flames. She and all the firemen  smelled the burned flesh from inside it. She knew nothing of the papers,  nor of Mr. Oldacre's private affairs.    \"So, my dear Watson, there's my report of a failure. And yet--and  yet--\"--he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction--\"I KNOW  it's all wrong. I feel it in my bones. There"]]]
