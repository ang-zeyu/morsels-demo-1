He had no legitimate offspring living; and it consequently became  practically certain that if the Princess outlived her uncle she would  succeed him on the Throne. The Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary Grant  was increased, and she took advantage of her improved resources to  familiarise the Princess with the social life of the nation. They paid  visits to historic houses and important towns, and received addresses.  This was a wise and prudent course, but the King spoke with ill-humour  of his niece's \"royal progresses.\" The chief cause of offence was that  the Princess was not allowed by the Duchess of Kent to make her public  appearances under his own auspices, as he not unnaturally desired.  He also began to suspect that the Princess was deliberately kept  away from Court; a painful controversy arose, and the Duchess  became gradually estranged from her brother-in-law, in spite of the  affectionate attempts of Queen Adelaide to smooth matters over. His  resentment culminated in a painful scene, in 1836, when the King, at  a State banquet at Windsor, made a speech of a preposterous character;  speaking of the Duchess, who sat next him, as \"that person,\" hinting  that she was surrounded with evil advisers, and adding that he should  insist on the Princess being more at Court. The Princess burst into  tears; the Duchess sate in silence: when the banquet was over, the  Duchess ordered her carriage, and was with difficulty prevailed upon  to remain at Windsor for the night. The King went so far in May 1837  as to offer the Princess an independent income, and the acceptance of  this by the Princess caused the Duchess considerable vexation; but the  project dropped. The King died in the following month, soon after the  Princess had attained her legal majority; he had always hoped that the  Duchess would not be Regent, and his wish was thus fulfilled.    It is no exaggeration to say that the accession of the Princess  Victoria reinstated the English monarchy in the affections of the  people. George IV. had made the Throne unpopular; William IV. had  restored its popularity, but not its dignity. Both of these kings were  men of decided ability, but of unbalanced temperament. In politics  both kings had followed a somewhat similar course. George IV. had  begun life as a strong Whig, and had been a close friend of Fox. Later  in life his political position resolved itself into a strong dislike  of Roman Catholic Relief. William IV. had begun his reign favourably  inclined to Parliamentary Reform; but though gratified by the personal  popularity which his attitude brought him in the country, he became  alarmed at the national temper displayed. It illustrates the tension  of the King's mind on the subject that, when he was told that if the  Reform Bill did not pass it would bring about a rebellion, he replied  that if it did bring about a rebellion he did not care: he should  defend London and raise the Royal Standard at Weedon (where there  was a military depot); and that the Duchess of Kent and the Princess  Victoria might come in if they could.      [Pageheading: CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT]    [Pageheading: SYMPATHY WITH MIDDLE CLASSES]    The reign of William IV. had witnessed the zenith of Whig efficiency.  It had seen the establishment of Parliamentary and Municipal Reform,  the Abolition of Slavery, the new Poor Law, and other important  measures. But, towards the end of the reign, the Whig party began  steadily to lose ground, and the Tories to consolidate themselves.  Lord Melbourne had succeeded Lord Grey at the head of the Whigs, and  the difference of administration was becoming every month more and  more apparent. The King indeed went so far as abruptly to dismiss his  Ministers, but Parliament was too strong for him. Lord Melbourne's  principles were fully as liberal as Lord Grey's, but he lacked  practical initiative, with the result that the Whigs gradually  forfeited popular estimation and became discredited. The new reign,  however, brought them a decided increase of strength. The Princess had  been brought up with strong Whig leanings, and, as is clear from  her letters, with an equally strong mistrust of Tory principles and  politicians.    A word may here be given to the Princess's own character and  temperament. She was high-spirited and wilful, but devotedly  affectionate, and almost typically feminine. She had a strong sense  of duty and dignity, and strong personal prejudices. Confident, in a  sense, as she was, she had the feminine instinct strongly developed of  dependence upon some manly adviser. She was full of high spirits, and  enjoyed excitement and life to the full. She liked the stir of London,  was fond of dancing, of concerts, plays, and operas, and devoted to  open-air exercise. Another important trait in her character must be  noted. She had strong monarchical views and dynastic sympathies,  but she had no aristocratic preferences; at the same time she had no  democratic principles, but believed firmly in the due subordination  of classes. The result of the parliamentary and municipal reforms of  William IV.'s reign had been to give the middle classes a share in  the government of the country, and it was supremely fortunate that the  Queen, by a providential gift of temperament, thoroughly understood  the middle-class point of view. The two qualities that are most  characteristic of British middle-class life are common sense and  family affection; and on these particular virtues the Queen's  character was based; so that by a happy intuition she was able to  interpret and express the spirit and temper of that class which,  throughout her reign, was destined to hold the balance of political  power in its hands. Behind lay a deep sense of religion, the religion  which centres in the belief in the Fatherhood of God, and is impatient  of dogmatic distinctions and subtleties.          CHAPTER III    QUEEN VICTORIA'S RELATIONS AND FRIENDS      It may be held to have been one of the chief blessings of Queen  Victoria's girlhood that she was brought closely under the influence  of an enlightened and large-minded Prince, Leopold, her maternal  uncle, afterwards King of the Belgians. He was born in 1790, being the  youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and his youth  was spent in the Russian military service. He had shown talent and  courage in the field, and had commanded a battalion at Luetzen and  Leipsic. He had married, in 1816, the Princess Charlotte, only child  of George IV. For many years his home was at Claremont, where the  Princess Charlotte had died; there the Princess Victoria spent many  happy holidays, and grew to regard her uncle with the most devoted  affection, almost, indeed, in the light of a father. It is said that  Prince Leopold had hoped to be named Regent, if a Regency should be  necessary.[1] He was offered, and accepted, the throne of Greece in  1830, but shrank from the difficulties of the position, and withdrew  his acceptance upon the plea that Lord Aberdeen, who was then Foreign  Secretary, was not prepared to make such financial arrangements as he  considered satisfactory.[2]        [Footnote 1: A practical proof of his interest in his niece      may be found in the fact that for years he contributed      between three and four thousand a year to the expenses of her      education, and for necessary holidays by the sea, at a time      when the Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary Grant was unequal to      the increasing expenses of her household.]        [Footnote 2: Greece after having obtained autonomy was in a      practically bankrupt condition, and the Powers had guaranteed      the financial credit of the country until it was able to      develop its own resources.]    It is interesting to observe from the correspondence that King Leopold  seems for many years to have continued to regret his decision; it was  not that he did not devote himself, heart and soul, to the country of  his adoption, but there seems to have been a romantic element in his  composition, which did not find its full satisfaction in presiding  over the destinies of a peaceful commercial nation.      [Pageheading: THE KING OF THE BELGIANS]    In 1831, when Louis Philippe, under pressure from Lord Palmerston,  declined the throne of Belgium for his son the Duc de Nemours, Prince  Leopold received and accepted an offer of the Crown. A Dutch invasion  followed, and the new King showed great courage and gallantry in an  engagement near Louvain, in which his army was hopelessly outnumbered.  But, though a sensitive man, the King's high courage and hopefulness  never deserted him. He ruled his country with diligence, ability, and  wisdom, and devoted himself to encouraging manufactures and commerce.  The result of his firm and liberal rule was manifested in 1848, when,  on his offering to resign the Crown if it was thought to be for  the best interests of the country, he was entreated, with universal  acclamation, to retain the sovereignty. Belgium passed through the  troubled years of revolution in comparative tranquillity. King Leopold  was a model ruler; his deportment was grave and serious; he was  conspicuous for honesty and integrity; he was laborious and upright,  and at the same time conciliatory and tactful.    He kept up a close correspondence with Queen Victoria, and paid her  several visits in England, where he was on intimate terms with  many leading Englishmen. It would be difficult to over-estimate the  importance of his close relations with the Queen; by example and  precept he inspired her with a high sense of duty, and from the first  instilled into her mind the necessity of acquainting herself closely  with the details of political administration. His wisdom, good sense,  and tenderness, as well as the close tie of blood that existed between  him and the Queen, placed him in a unique position with regard to her,  and it is plain that he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20031"],[0,"A Final Reckoning: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia (#8)"],[1,"mother, who was so kind to all the village  people, should be so implacable on this subject. But Kate, who was  now between fourteen and fifteen, knew that when her mother had  taken up certain opinions they were not to be shaken; and that her  father himself always avoided argument, on points on which he  differed from her. Talking alone with his daughter the squire had,  in answer to her sturdy assertion of Reuben's innocence, owned to  her that he himself had his doubts on the subject, and that he was  sorry he had dismissed the boy from his service; but she had never  heard him do more than utter a protest, against Reuben's guilt  being held as being absolutely proved, when her mother spoke of his  delinquency.    But Kate was not one to desert a protege and, having been the means  of Reuben's introduction to her father's, she had always regarded  herself as his natural protector; and Mrs. Ellison would not have  been pleased, had she known that her daughter had seldom met the  schoolmaster without inquiring if he had heard how Reuben was  getting on. She had even asked Mr. Shrewsbury to assure him of her  belief in his innocence, which had been done; but she had resolved  that, should she ever meet him, she would herself tell him so, even  at the risk of her mother's displeasure.    Another year passed. Reuben was now seventeen, and was a tall,  powerfully-built young fellow. During these four years he had never  been over to Tipping, in the daytime; but had occasionally walked  over, after dark, to visit the Shrewsburys, always going on special  invitation, when he knew that no one else would be there. The  Thornes no longer occupied the little public house. Tom Thorne had,  a year before, been captured with two other poachers in the  squire's woods, and had had six months' hard labour; and his father  had at once been ejected from his house, and had disappeared from  that part of the country. Reuben was glad that they had left; for  he had long before heard that Thorne had spread the story, in  Lewes, of the poisoning of the dog. He felt, however, with their  departure all chance of his ever being righted in that matter was  at an end.    One evening in winter, when Reuben had done his work, he said to  his mother:    \"I shall go over and see Mr. Shrewsbury tonight. I have not been  over for some time and, as it is not his night for a class, I am  pretty sure not to find anyone there. I told him, when I was there  last, that I would take over a few tools and fix up those shelves  for him.    \"I don't suppose he will stay very much longer at Tipping. His  health is completely restored now, and even his wife admits that he  could work at his own business again. He has already been doing a  little, for some of the houses he worked for in town, so as to get  his connection back again. I expect, every time I see him, to hear  that he has made up his mind to go. He would have done it, two  years back; but his wife and the two little ones are so well that  he did not like the thought of taking them up to London, till he  was sure that his health was strong enough to stand steady work. I  shall miss them very much. He has been a good friend, indeed, to  me.\"    \"He has indeed,\" Mrs. Whitney said. \"I think anyhow, Reuben, you  would have got on at your trade; but you would never have been what  you are now, if it hadn't been for him. Your poor father would be  proud of you, if he could see you; and I am sure that, when you  take off that workman's suit and put on your Sunday clothes, you  look as well as if the mill had never gone wrong, and you had been  brought up as he intended you to be. Mrs. Tyler was saying only the  other day that you looked quite the gentleman, and lots of people  have said the same.\"    \"Nonsense, mother,\" Reuben answered, \"there is nothing of the  gentleman about me. Of course, people say things that they think  will please you, knowing that you regard me as a sort of wonder. I  hope I shall make my way some day, and the fact that I have had a  better education than most young fellows, in my position of life,  of course may make some little difference; and will, I hope, help  me to mount the ladder, when once I put my foot upon it.\"    But although, no doubt, Mrs. Whitney was a partial judge, her  opinion as to her son was not an incorrect one; for with his  intelligent face, and quiet self-assured bearing, he looked very  much more like a gentleman than many young fellows in a far better  position in life.    The stars were shining brightly when he started, at seven o'clock  in the evening; and he walked with a brisk step, until he arrived  within half a mile of the village. As he passed by the end of a  lane which ran into the road, he heard a horse impatiently pawing  the ground; the sound being followed by a savage oath, to the  animal, to stand quiet. Reuben walked on a few steps, and then  paused. The lane, as he knew, only led to some fields a short  distance away. What could a horse be doing there? And who could be  the man who spoke to it? There had, lately, been several burglaries  on lonely houses, in that part of the country; and the general  belief was that these had been perpetrated by men from London.    \"I daresay it's nothing,\" Reuben said to himself. \"Still, it is  certainly curious and, at any rate, there can be no harm in having  a look.\"    Walking upon the grass at the side of the road, he retraced his  steps to the end of the lane, and then stood and listened. He heard  a murmur of voices, and determined to follow the matter up. He  walked quietly down the lane. After going about a hundred yards, he  saw something dark in the road and, approaching it very cautiously,  found that it was a horse harnessed to a gig. As he was standing  wondering what to do next he started, for the silence was broken by  some voices near him.    \"It was a stupid thing to get here so early, and to have to wait  about for four hours in this ditch.\"    \"It was the best plan though,\" another voice replied. \"The trap  might have been noticed, if we had been driving about the roads  after dark; while in the daylight no one would give it a second  thought.\"    \"That's right enough,\" the first speaker said, \"but it's precious  cold here. Hand me that flask again. I am blest if the wind does  not come through the hedge like a knife.\"    The voices came from the other side of the hedge, on the opposite  side of the lane. Reuben crossed noiselessly. There was a gate just  where the cart had stopped, and the men had evidently got over it,  to obtain the shelter of the hedge from the wind. Reuben felt the  gate, which was old and rickety; then cautiously he placed his feet  on the lower bar, and leaned forward so as to look round the hedge.    \"What time are the others to be here, Tom?\"    \"They said they would be here at nine o'clock. We passed them about  six miles on the road, so they ought to be here to time.\"    \"I suppose there's no doubt about this here being a good business?\"    \"I will answer for that,\" the other said. \"I don't suppose as  there's much money in the house, but there's no end of silver  plate, and their watches, and plenty of sparklers. I have heard say  as there's no one in the county as has more jewels than the  squire's wife.\"    \"You know the house well, don't you?\"    \"I never was inside,\" the other said, \"but I have heard enough,  from them that has, to know where the rooms lie. The plate chest is  in the butler's pantry and, as we are going to get in by the  kitchen window, we are safe to be able to clear that out without  being heard. I shall go on, directly the others come, and chuck  this meat to the dogs--that will silence them. I know the way  there, for I tried that on once before.\"    Reuben had thought that the voice was familiar to him, and the  words gave him the clue--the speaker was Tom Thorne--and he, and  those with him, were going to commit a burglary at the squire's. He  was hesitating whether to make off at once, to warn the squire of  what was intended; or to listen and learn a little more of their  plan, when suddenly a light shone behind him, and a voice exclaimed  with an oath:    \"Who have we here?\"    He leapt down, and was in the act of turning round to defend  himself, when a heavy blow with a cudgel struck him on the head,  and felled him insensible to the ground. While he had been  listening to the conversation, two men had come quietly up the  lane, walking on the grass as he had done; and their footsteps had  been unheard by him, for the horse continued, at times, impatiently  to paw the ground. The sound of their comrades' voices had told  them where they were sitting and, turning on a bull's-eye lantern  to show them the gate, they had seen Reuben leaning over it, in the  act of listening.    When Reuben recovered consciousness, he found that he was lying in  the ditch, his hands tightly bound to his sides, and a handkerchief  stuffed into his mouth. The four men were gathered close by,  talking in low tones.    \"I ain't going to give up the job, now we come so far to do it,\"  one said, with an oath. \"Besides, it's not only the swag, but the  grudge I owe the squire. If I am ready to go on, I suppose you  needn't be afraid; besides, he don't know us.\"    \"Best cut his throat and a done with it,\" a voice, which Reuben  recognized as that of his old enemy, said. \"I owe him one, and it  will be safest to stop his mouth.\"    \"No, no,\" a third voice protested; \"I ain't going to have nothing  to do with cutting throats. I don't mind running the risk of Botany  Bay, but I ain't going to run the chance of being scragged. But  let's move a bit away from here, while we settle it. You hit him  pretty hard, but he will be coming round presently. I thought at  first that you had killed him, but he's bleeding too free for  that.\"    The men moved some little distance away, and for some time Reuben  could hear a murmured talk, but could make out"]]]
