[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#8)"],[1,"  \"Now we must find Willy Wagtail,\" said the Kangaroo. \"The chances are  Click-i-ti-clack, his big cousin who lives in the bush, will be able to  tell us where to find him; for he doesn't care for the bush, and lives  almost entirely with Humans, and the queer creatures they have brought  into the country now-a-days. We may have to go a long way, so hop into  my pouch, and we will get on our way.\"    Once more Dot was in the kind Kangaroo's pouch. It was in the latter end  of autumn, and the air was so keen, that, as her torn little frock was  now very little protection to her against the cold, she was glad to be  back in that nice fur bag. She was used now to the springy bounding of  the great Kangaroo, and felt quite safe; so that she quite enjoyed the  wonderful and seemingly dangerous things the animal did in its great  leaps and jumps.    With many rests and stops to eat berries or grass on their way, they  searched the bush for the rest of the day without finding the big bush  Wagtail. All kinds of creatures had seen him, or heard his strange  rattling, chattering song; but it always seemed that he had just flown  off a few minutes before they heard of him. It was most vexatious, and  Dot saw that another night must pass before they would be able to hear  of her home. She did not like to think of that, for she could picture to  herself all those great men, on their big rough horses, coming back to  her father's cottage that night, and how they would begin to be quiet  and sad.    She thought it would not be half so bad to be lost, if the people at  home could only know that one was safe and snug in a kind Kangaroo's  pouch; but she knew that her parents could never suppose that she was  so well cared for, and would only think that she was dying alone in  the terrible bush--dying for want of food and water, and from fear and  exposure. How strange it seemed that people should die like that in the  bush, where so many creatures lived well, and happily! But then they had  not bush friends to tell them what berries and roots to eat, and where  to get water, and to cuddle them up in a nice warm fur during the cold  night. As she thought of this she rubbed her face against the Kangaroo's  soft coat, and patted her with her little hands; and the affectionate  animal was so pleased at these caresses, that she jumped clean over a  watercourse, twenty feet at least, in one bound.    It was getting evening time, and the sun was setting with a beautiful  rosy colour, as they came upon a lovely scene. They had followed the  watercourse until it widened out into a great shallow creek beside a  grassy plain. As they emerged from the last scattered bushes and trees  of the forest, and hopped out into the open side of a range of hills,  miles and miles of grass country, with dim distant hills, stretched  before them. The great shining surface of the creek caught the rosy  evening light, and every pink cloudlet in the sky looked doubly  beautiful reflected in the water. Here and there out of the water arose  giant skeleton trees, with huge silver trunks and contorted dead  branches. On these twisted limbs were numbers of birds: Shag, blue and  white Cranes, and black and white Ibis with their bent bills. Slowly  paddling on the creek, with graceful movements, were twenty or thirty  black Swans, and in and out of their ranks, as they passed in stately  procession, shot wild Ducks and Moor Hens, like a flotilla of little  boats amongst a fleet of big ships. All these birds were watching a  pretty sight that arrested Dot's attention at once. By the margin of the  creek, where tufted rushes and tall sedges shed their graceful  reflection on the pink waters, were a party of Native Companions  dancing.    \"In these times it is seldom we can see a sight like this,\" said the  Kangaroo. \"The water is generally too unsafe for the birds to enjoy  themselves. It often means death to them to have a little pleasure.\"    As the Kangaroo spoke, one of the Native Companions caught sight of her,  and leaving the dance, opened her wings, and still making dainty steps  with her long legs, half danced and half flew to where the Kangaroo was  sitting.    \"Good evening, Kangaroo,\" she said, gracefully bowing; \"will you not  come a little nearer to see the dance?\" Then the Native Companion saw  Dot in the Kangaroo's pouch, and made a little spring of surprise. \"Dear  me!\" she said, \"what have you in your pouch?\"    \"It's a Human,\" said the Kangaroo, apologetically; \"it's quite a little  harmless one. Let me introduce you.\"    So Dot alighted from the pouch, and joined in the conversation, and the  Native Companion was much interested in hearing her story.    \"Do you dance?\" asked the Native Companion, with a quick turn of her  head, on its long, graceful neck. Dot said that she loved dancing. So  the Native Companion took her down to the creek, and all the other  Companions stopped dancing and gathered round her, whilst she was  introduced and her story told. Then they spread their wings, and with  stately steps escorted her to the edge of the water, whilst the Kangaroo  sat a little way off, and delightedly watched the proceedings.    Dot didn't understand any of the figures of the dance; but the scenery  was so lovely, and so was the pink sunset, and the Native Companions  were so elegant and gay, that, catching up her ragged little skirts in  both hands, she followed their movements with her bare brown feet as  best she could, and enjoyed herself very much. To Dot, the eight birds  that took part in the entertainment were very tall and splendid, with  their lovely grey plumage and greeny heads, and she felt quite small as  they gathered round her sometimes, and enclosed her within their  outspread wings. And how beautiful their dancing was! How light their  dainty steps! as their feet scarcely touched the earth; and what  fantastic measures they danced! advancing, retreating, circling  round--with their beautiful wings keeping the rhythm of their feet.  There was one figure that Dot thought the prettiest of all--when they  danced in line at the margin of the water; stepping, and bowing, and  gracefully gyrating to their shadows, which were reflected with the pink  clouds of evening on the surface of the creek.    Dot was very sorry, and hot, and breathless, when the dance came to an  end. The sun had been gone a long time, and all the pink shades had  slowly turned to grey; the creek had lost its radiant colour, and looked  like a silver mirror, and so desolate and sombre, that no one could have  imagined it to have been the scene of so much gaiety shortly before.    Dot hastily returned to the Kangaroo, and all the Native Companions came  daintily, and made graceful adieus to them both. Afterwards, they spread  their great, soft wings, and, stretching their long legs behind them,  wheeled upwards to the darkening sky. Then all the birds in the bare  trees preened their feathers, and settled down for the night; and the  Kangaroo took her little Human charge back to the bush, where there was  a cosy sheltering rock, under which to pass the night, and they lay down  together, with the stars peeping at them through the branches of the  trees.    They had slept for a long time, as it seemed to Dot, when they were  awakened by a little voice saying:    \"Wake up, Kangaroo! you are in danger. Get away, as soon as possible!\"    The moon was shining fitfully, as it broke through swift flying clouds.  In the uncertain light, Dot could see a little creature near them, and  knew at once that it was an Opossum.    \"What is the matter?\" asked the Kangaroo, softly. \"Blacks!\" said the  Opossum. And as it spoke, Dot heard a sound as of a half dingo dog  howling and snapping in the distance. As that sound was heard, the  Opossum made one flying leap to the nearest tree, and scrambled out of  sight in a moment.    \"I wish he had told us a little more,\" said the Kangaroo. \"Still, for  a 'possum, it was a good-natured act to wake me up. They are selfish,  spiteful little beasts, as a rule. Now I wonder where those Blacks are?  I shall have to go a little way to sniff and listen. I won't go far, so  don't be afraid, but stay quietly here until I come back.\"          CHAPTER VI      It was terrible to Dot to see the Kangaroo hop off into the dark bush,  and to find herself all alone; so she crawled out from under the ledge  of rock into the moonlight, and sat on a stone where she could see the  sky, and watch the black ragged clouds hurry over the moon. But the bush  was not altogether quiet. She could hear an owl hooting at the moon. Not  far off was a camp of quarrelsome Flying Foxes, and the melancholy  Nightjar in the distance was fulfilling its mission of making all the  bush creatures miserable with its incessant, mournful \"mo-poke!  mo-poke!\" As Dot could understand all the voices, it amused her to  listen to the wrangles of the Flying Foxes, as they ate the fruit of a  wild fig tree near by. She saw them swoop past on their huge black wings  with a solemn flapping. Then, as each little Fox approached the tree,  the Foxes who were there already screamed, and swore in dreadfully bad  language at the visitor. For every little Fox on the tree was afraid  some other Flying Fox would eat all the figs, and as each visitor  arrived he was assailed with cries of, \"Get away! you're not wanted  here!\"    \"This is my branch, my figs!\"    \"Go and find figs for yourself!\"    \"These figs are not half ripe like the juicy ones on the other side of  the tree!\"    Then the new-comer Flying Fox, with a spiteful squeal, would pounce down  on a branch already occupied, and angry spluttering and screams would  arise, followed by a heavy fall of fighting Foxes tumbling with a crash  through the trees. Then out into the open sky swept dozens of black  wings, accompanied by abusive swearing from dozens of wicked little  brown Foxes; and, as they settled again on the tree, all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#8)"],[1,"figure, was an abomination. The early Church fathers opposed it.  It was forbidden by the Mosaic decalogue and savored of idolatry.    But what should take its place in art? How could the new Christian  ideas be expressed without form? Symbolism came in, but it was  insufficient. A party in the Church rose up in favor of more direct  representation. Art should be used as an engine of the Church to teach  the Bible to those who could not read. This argument held good, and  notwithstanding the opposition of the Iconoclastic party painting grew  in favor. It lent itself to teaching and came under ecclesiastical  domination. As it left the nature of the classic world and loosened  its grasp on things tangible it became feeble and decrepit in its  form. While it grew in sentiment and religious fervor it lost in  bodily vigor and technical ability.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--CATACOMB FRESCO. CRYPT OF S. CECILIA. THIRD  CENTURY.]    For many centuries the religious motive held strong, and art was the  servant of the Church. It taught the Bible truths, but it also  embellished and adorned the interiors of the churches. All the  frescos, mosaics, and altar-pieces had a decorative motive in their  coloring and setting. The church building was a house of refuge for  the oppressed, and it was made attractive not only in its lines and  proportions but in its ornamentation. Hence the two motives of the  early work--religious teaching and decoration.    SUBJECTS AND TECHNICAL METHODS: There was no distinct Judaic or  Christian type used in the very early art. The painters took their  models directly from the Roman frescos and marbles. It was the classic  figure and the classic costume, and those who produced the painting  of the early period were the degenerate painters of the classic world.  The figure was rather short and squat, coarse in the joints, hands,  and feet, and almost expressionless in the face. Christian life at  that time was passion-strung, but the faces in art do not show it, for  the reason that the Roman frescos were the painter's model, not the  people of the Christian community about him. There was nothing like a  realistic presentation at this time. The type alone was given.    In the drawing it was not so good as that shown in the Roman and  Pompeian frescos. There was a mechanism about its production, a  copying by unskilled hands, a negligence or an ignorance of form that  showed everywhere. The coloring, again, was a conventional scheme of  flat tints in reddish-browns and bluish-greens, with heavy outline  bands of brown. There was little perspective or background, and the  figures in panels were separated by vines, leaves, or other ornamental  division lines. Some relief was given to the figure by the brown  outlines. Light-and-shade was not well rendered, and composition was  formal. The great part of this early work was done in fresco after the  Roman formula, and was executed on the walls of the Catacombs. Other  forms of art showed in the gilded glasses, in manuscript illumination,  and, later, in the mosaics.    Technically the work begins to decline from the beginning in  proportion as painting was removed from the knowledge of the ancient  world. About the fifth century the figure grew heavy and stiff. A new  type began to show itself. The Roman toga was exchanged for the long  liturgical garment which hid the proportions of the body, the lines  grew hard and dark, a golden nimbus appeared about the head, and the  patriarchal in appearance came into art. The youthful Orphic face of  Christ changed to a solemn visage, with large, round eyes, saint-like  beard, and melancholy air. The classic qualities were fast  disappearing. Eastern types and elements were being introduced  through Byzantium. Oriental ornamentation, gold embossing, rich color  were doing away with form, perspective, light-and-shade, and  background.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--CHRIST AS GOOD SHEPHERD. MOSAIC, RAVENNA,  FIFTH CENTURY.]    The color was rich and the mechanical workmanship fair for the time,  but the figure had become paralytic. It shrouded itself in a sack-like  brocaded gown, had no feet at times, and instead of standing on the  ground hung in the air. Facial expression ran to contorted features,  holiness became moroseness, and sadness sulkiness. The flesh was  brown, the shadows green-tinted, giving an unhealthy look to the  faces. Add to this the gold ground (a Persian inheritance), the gilded  high lights, the absence of perspective, and the composing of groups  so that the figures looked piled one upon another instead of receding,  and we have the style of painting that prevailed in Byzantium and  Italy from about the ninth to the thirteenth century. Nothing of a  technical nature was in its favor except the rich coloring and the  mechanical adroitness of the fitting.    EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTING: The earliest Christian painting appeared on  the walls of the Catacombs in Rome. These were decorated with panels  and within the panels were representations of trailing vines, leaves,  fruits, flowers, with birds and little genii or cupids. It was  painting similar to the Roman work, and had no Christian significance  though in a Christian place. Not long after, however, the desire to  express something of the faith began to show itself in a symbolic way.  The cups and the vases became marked with the fish, because the Greek  spelling of the word \"icthus\" gave the initials of the Christian  confession of faith. The paintings of the shepherd bearing a sheep  symbolized Christ and his flock; the anchor meant the Christian hope;  the phoenix immortality; the ship the Church; the cock watchfulness,  and so on. And at this time the decorations began to have a double  meaning. The vine came to represent the \"I am the vine\" and the birds  grew longer wings and became doves, symbolizing pure Christian souls.    It has been said this form of art came about through fear of  persecution, that the Christians hid their ideas in symbols because  open representation would be followed by violence and desecration.  Such was hardly the case. The emperors persecuted the living, but the  dead and their sepulchres were exempt from sacrilege by Roman law.  They probably used the symbol because they feared the Roman figure and  knew no other form to take its place. But symbolism did not supply the  popular need; it was impossible to originate an entirely new figure;  so the painters went back and borrowed the old Roman form. Christ  appeared as a beardless youth in Phrygian costume, the Virgin Mary was  a Roman matron, and the Apostles looked like Roman senators wearing  the toga.    Classic story was also borrowed to illustrate Bible truth. Hermes  carrying the sheep was the Good Shepherd, Psyche discovering Cupid was  the curiosity of Eve, Ulysses closing his ears to the Sirens was the  Christian resisting the tempter. The pagan Orpheus charming the  animals of the wood was finally adopted as a symbol, or perhaps an  ideal likeness of Christ. Then followed more direct representation in  classic form and manner, the Old Testament prefiguring and emphasizing  the New. Jonah appeared cast into the sea and cast by the whale on dry  land again as a symbol of the New Testament resurrection, and also as  a representation of the actual occurrence. Moses striking the rock  symbolized life eternal, and David slaying Goliath was Christ  victorious.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--CHRIST AND SAINTS. FRESCO. S. GENEROSA,  SEVENTH CENTURY (?).]    The chronology of the Catacombs painting is very much mixed, but it is  quite certain there was degeneracy from the start. The cause was  neglect of form, neglect of art as art, mechanical copying instead of  nature study, and finally, the predominance of the religious idea over  the forms of nature. With Constantine Christianity was recognized as  the national religion. Christian art came out of the Catacombs and  began to show itself in illuminations, mosaics, and church  decorations. Notwithstanding it was now free from restraint it did not  improve. Church traditions prevailed, sentiment bordered upon  sentimentality, and the technic of painting passed from bad to worse.    The decline continued during the sixth and seventh centuries, owing  somewhat perhaps to the influence of Byzantium and the introduction  into Italy of Eastern types and elements. In the eighth century the  Iconoclastic controversy broke out again in fury with the edict of Leo  the Isaurian. This controversy was a renewal of the old quarrel in the  Church about the use of pictures and images. Some wished them for  instruction in the Word; others decried them as leading to idolatry.  It was a long quarrel of over a hundred years' duration, and a deadly  one for art. When it ended, the artists were ordered to follow the  traditions, not to make any new creations, and not to model any figure  in the round. The nature element in art was quite dead at that time,  and the order resulted only in diverting the course of painting toward  the unrestricted miniatures and manuscripts. The native Italian art  was crushed for a time by this new ecclesiastical burden. It did not  entirely disappear, but it gave way to the stronger, though equally  restricted art that had been encroaching upon it for a long time--the  art of Byzantium.    BYZANTINE PAINTING: Constantinople was rebuilt and rechristened by  Constantine, a Christian emperor, in the year 328 A.D. It became a  stronghold of Christian traditions, manners, customs, art. But it was  not quite the same civilization as that of Rome and the West. It was  bordered on the south and east by oriental influences, and much of  Eastern thought, method, and glamour found its way into the Christian  community. The artists fought this influence, stickling a long time  for the severer classicism of ancient Greece. For when Rome fell the  traditions of the Old World centred around Constantinople."]]]
