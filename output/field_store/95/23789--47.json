The colored people of  this country are especially fortunate, for, Praise be to God! conditions  here are so much higher than in the East and comparatively few differences  exist in the possibility of equal attainments with the white race. May  both develop toward the highest degree of equality and altruism. May you  be drawn together in friendship and may extraordinary development make  brotherhood a reality and truth. I pray in your behalf that there shall be  no name other than that of humanity among you.    Therefore strive earnestly and put forth your greatest endeavor toward the  accomplishment of this fellowship and the cementing of this bond of  brotherhood between you. Such an attainment is not possible without will  and effort on the part of each; from one, expressions of gratitude and  appreciation; from the other kindliness and recognition of equality. Each  one should endeavor to develop and assist the other toward mutual  advancement. This is possible only by conjoining of effort and  inclination. Love and unity will be fostered between you, thereby bringing  about the oneness of mankind. For the accomplishment of unity between the  colored and whites will be an assurance of the world's peace. Then racial  prejudice, national prejudice, limited patriotism and religious bias will  pass away and remain no longer. I am pleased to see you at this gathering,  white and dark, and I praise God that I have had this opportunity of  seeing you loving each other, for this is the means of the glory of  humanity. This is the means of the good-pleasure of God and of eternal  bliss in His Kingdom. Therefore I pray in your behalf that you may attain  to the fullest of love and that the day may come when all differences  between you may disappear.            THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE      What could be better before God than thinking of the poor? For the poor  are beloved by our heavenly Father. When His Holiness Christ came upon the  earth those who believed in him and followed him were the poor and lowly,  showing the poor were near to God. When a rich man believes and follows  the Manifestation of God it is a proof that his wealth is not an obstacle  and does not prevent him from attaining the pathway of salvation. After he  has been tested and tried it will be seen whether his possessions are a  hindrance in his religious life. But the poor are especially beloved of  God. Their lives are full of difficulties, their trials continual, their  hopes are in God alone. Therefore you must assist the poor as much as  possible, even by sacrifice of yourself. No deed of man is greater before  God than helping the poor. Spiritual conditions are not dependent upon the  possession of worldly treasures or the absence of them. When physically  destitute, spiritual thoughts are more likely. Poverty is stimulus toward  God. Each one of you must have great consideration for the poor and render  them assistance. Organize in an effort to help them and prevent increase  of poverty. The greatest means for prevention is that whereby the laws of  the community will be so framed and enacted that it will not be possible  for a few to be millionaires and many destitute. One of Baha'u'llah's  teachings is the adjustment of means of livelihood in human society. Under  this adjustment there can be no extremes in human conditions as regards  wealth and sustenance. For the community needs financier, farmer merchant  and laborer just as an army must be composed of commander, officers and  privates. All cannot be commanders; all cannot be officers or privates.  Each in his station in the social fabric must be competent; each in his  function according to ability; but justness of opportunity for all.    Lycurgus, king of Sparta, who lived long before the day of Christ,  conceived the idea of absolute equality in government. He proclaimed laws  by which all the people of Sparta were classified into certain divisions.  Each division had its separate rights and function. First, farmers and  tillers of the soil. Second, artisans and merchants. Third, leaders or  grandees. Under the laws of Lycurgus the latter were not required to  engage in any labor or vocation but it was incumbent upon them to defend  the country in case of war and invasion. Then he divided Sparta into nine  thousand equal parts or provinces, appointing nine thousand leaders or  grandees to protect them. In this way the farmers of each province were  assured of protection but each farmer was compelled to pay a tax to  support the grandee of that province. The farmers and merchants were not  obliged to defend the country. In lieu of labor the grandees received the  taxes. Lycurgus in order to establish this forever as a law, brought nine  thousand grandees together, told them he was going upon a long journey and  wished this form of government to remain effective until his return. They  swore an oath to protect and preserve his law. He then left his kingdom,  went into voluntary exile and never came back. No man ever made such a  sacrifice to insure equality among his fellowmen. A few years passed and  the whole system of government he had founded collapsed, although  established upon such a just and wise basis.    Difference of capacity in human individuals is fundamental. It is  impossible for all to be alike, all to be equal, all to be wise.  Baha'u'llah has revealed principles and laws which will accomplish the  adjustment of varying human capacities. He has said that whatsoever is  possible of accomplishment in human government will be effected through  these principles. When the laws he has instituted are carried out there  will be no millionaires possible in the community and likewise no  extremely poor. This will be effected and regulated by adjusting the  different degrees of human capacity. The fundamental basis of the  community is agriculture, tillage of the soil. All must be producers. Each  person in the community whose income is equal to his individual producing  capacity shall be exempt from taxation. But if his income is greater than  his needs he must pay a tax until an adjustment is effected. That is to  say, a man's capacity for production and his needs will be equalized and  reconciled through taxation. If his production exceeds he will pay no tax;  if his necessities exceed his production he shall receive an amount  sufficient to equalize or adjust. Therefore taxation will be proportionate  to capacity and production and there will be no poor in the community.            COOPERATION      It seems as though all creatures can exist singly and alone. For example,  a tree can exist solitary and alone on a given prairie or in a valley or  on the mountainside. An animal upon a mountain or a bird soaring in the  air might live a solitary life. They are not in need of cooperation or  solidarity. Such animated beings enjoy the greatest comfort and happiness  in their respective solitary lives.    On the contrary, man cannot live singly and alone. He is in need of  continuous cooperation and mutual help. For example, a man living alone in  the wilderness will eventually starve. He can never, singly and alone,  provide himself with all the necessities of existence. Therefore, he is in  need of cooperation and reciprocity.    The mystery of this phenomenon, the cause thereof is this, that mankind  has been created from one single origin, has branched off from one family.  Thus in reality all mankind represents one family. God has not created any  difference. He has created all as one that thus this family might live in  perfect happiness and well-being.    Regarding reciprocity and cooperation: each member of the body politic  should live in the utmost comfort and welfare because each individual  member of humanity is a member of the body politic and if one member of  the members be in distress or be afflicted with some disease all the other  members must necessarily suffer. For example, a member of the human  organism is the eye. If the eye should be affected that affliction would  affect the whole nervous system. Hence, if a member of the body politic  becomes afflicted, in reality, from the standpoint of sympathetic  connection, all will share that affliction since this (one afflicted) is a  member of the group of members, a part of the whole. Is it possible for  one member or part to be in distress and the other members to be at ease?  It is impossible! Hence God has desired that in the body politic of  humanity each one shall enjoy perfect welfare and comfort.    Although the body politic is one family yet because of lack of harmonious  relations some members are comfortable and some in direst misery, some  members are satisfied and some are hungry, some members are clothed in  most costly garments and some families are in need of food and shelter.  Why? Because this family lacks the necessary reciprocity and symmetry.  This household is not well arranged. This household is not living under a  perfect law. All the laws which are legislated do not ensure happiness.  They do not provide comfort. Therefore a law must be given to this family  by means of which all the members of this family will enjoy equal  well-being and happiness.    Is it possible for one member of a family to be subjected to the utmost  misery and to abject poverty and for the rest of the family to be  comfortable? It is impossible unless those members of the family be  senseless, atrophied, inhospitable, unkind. Then they would say, \"Though  these members do belong to our family--let them alone. Let us look after  ourselves. Let them die. So long as I am comfortable, I am honored, I am  happy--this my brother--let him die. If he be in misery let him remain in  misery, so long as I am comfortable. If he is hungry let him remain so; I  am satisfied. If he is without clothes, so long as I am clothed, let him  remain as he is. If he is shelterless, homeless, so long as I have a home,  let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#8)"],[1,"speak,  is the \"breaker\" of the laws of nature.    Consider, for example, that man according to natural law should dwell upon  the surface of the earth. By overcoming this law and restriction however  he sails in ships over the ocean, mounts to the zenith in aeroplanes and  sinks to the depths of the sea in submarines. This is against the fiat of  nature and a violation of her sovereignty and dominion. Nature's laws and  methods, the hidden secrets and mysteries of the universe, human  inventions and discoveries, all our scientific acquisitions should  naturally remain concealed and unknown, but man through his intellectual  acumen searches them out of the plane of the invisible, draws them into  the plane of the visible, exposes and explains them. For instance, one of  the mysteries of nature is electricity. According to nature this force,  this energy should remain latent and hidden, but man scientifically breaks  through the very laws of nature, arrests it and even imprisons it for his  use.    In brief, man through the possession of this ideal endowment of scientific  investigation is the most noble product of creation, the governor of  nature. He takes the sword from nature's hand and uses it upon nature's  head. According to natural law, night is a period of darkness and  obscurity, but man by utilizing the power of electricity, by wielding this  electric sword overcomes the darkness and dispels the gloom. Man is  superior to nature and makes nature do his bidding. Man is a sensitive  being; nature is minus sensation. Man has memory and reason; nature lacks  them. Man is nobler than nature. There are powers within him of which  nature is devoid. It may be claimed that these powers are from nature  itself and that man is a part of nature. In answer to this statement we  will say that if nature is the whole and man is a part of that whole, how  could it be possible for a part to possess qualities and virtues which are  absent in the whole? Undoubtedly the part must be endowed with the same  qualities and properties as the whole. For example, the hair is a part of  the human anatomy. It cannot contain elements which are not found in other  parts of the body, for in all cases the component elements of the body are  the same. Therefore it is manifest and evident that man, although in body  a part of nature, nevertheless in spirit possesses a power transcending  nature; for if he were simply a part of nature and limited to material  laws he could possess only the things which nature embodies. God has  conferred upon and added to man a distinctive power, the faculty of  intellectual investigation into the secrets of creation, the acquisition  of higher knowledge, the greatest virtue of which is scientific  enlightenment.    This endowment is the most praiseworthy power of man, for through its  employment and exercise, the betterment of the human race is accomplished,  the development of the virtues of mankind is made possible and the spirit  and mysteries of God become manifest. Therefore I am greatly pleased with  my visit to this university. Praise be to God! that this country abounds  in such institutions of learning where the knowledge of sciences and arts  may readily be acquired.    As material and physical sciences are taught here and are constantly  unfolding in wider vistas of attainment, I am hopeful that spiritual  development may also follow and keep pace with these outer advantages. As  material knowledge is illuminating those within the walls of this great  temple of learning, so also may the light of the spirit, the inner and  divine light of the real philosophy glorify this institution. The most  important principle of divine philosophy is the oneness of the world of  humanity, the unity of mankind, the bond conjoining east and west, the tie  of love which blends human hearts.    Therefore it is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and summon all  our energies in order that the bonds of unity and accord may be  established among mankind. For thousands of years we have had bloodshed  and strife. It is enough; it is sufficient. Now is the time to associate  together in love and harmony. For thousands of years we have tried the  sword and warfare; let mankind for a time at least live in peace. Review  history and consider how much savagery, how much bloodshed and battle the  world has witnessed. It has been either religious warfare, political  warfare or some other clash of human interests. The world of humanity has  never enjoyed the blessing of Universal Peace. Year by year the implements  of warfare have been increased and perfected. Consider the wars of past  centuries; only ten, fifteen or twenty thousand at the most were killed  but now it is possible to kill one hundred thousand in a single day. In  ancient times warfare was carried on with the sword; today it is the  smokeless gun. Formerly battleships were sailing vessels; today they are  dreadnoughts. Consider the increase and improvement in the weapons of war.  God has created us all human and all countries of the world are parts of  the same globe. We are all his servants. He is kind and just to all. Why  should we be unkind and unjust to each other? He provides for all. Why  should we deprive one another? He protects and preserves all. Why should  we kill our fellow-creatures? If this warfare and strife be for the sake  of religion, it is evident that it violates the spirit and basis of all  religion. All the divine Manifestations have proclaimed the oneness of God  and the unity of mankind. They have taught that men should love and  mutually help each other in order that they might progress. Now if this  conception of religion be true, its essential principle is the oneness of  humanity. The fundamental truth of the Manifestations is peace. This  underlies all religion, all justice. The divine purpose is that men should  live in unity, concord and agreement and should love one another. Consider  the virtues of the human world and realize that the oneness of humanity is  the primary foundation of them all. Read the Gospel and the other holy  books. You will find their fundamentals are one and the same. Therefore  unity is the essential truth of religion and when so understood embraces  all the virtues of the human world. Praise be to God! this knowledge has  been spread, eyes have been opened and ears have become attentive.  Therefore we must endeavor to promulgate and practice the religion of God  which has been founded by all the prophets. And the religion of God is  absolute love and unity.          TEACHINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH      I will speak to you concerning the special teachings of Baha'u'llah. All  the divine principles announced by the tongue of the prophets of the past  are to be found in the words of Baha'u'llah; but in addition to these, He  has revealed certain new teachings which are not found in any of the  sacred books of former times. I shall mention some of them; the others  which are many in number may be found in the books, tablets and epistles  written by Baha'u'llah, such as the Hidden Words, the Glad-Tidings, the  Words of Paradise, Tajalliyat, Tarazat and others. Likewise in the Book of  Aqdas there are new teachings which cannot be found in any of the past  books or epistles of the prophets.    A fundamental teaching of Baha'u'llah is the oneness of the world of  humanity. Addressing mankind, He says: \"Ye are all leaves of one tree and  the fruits of one branch.\" By this it is meant that the world of humanity  is like a tree, the nations or peoples are the different limbs or branches  of that tree and the individual human creatures are as the fruits and  blossoms thereof. In this way His Holiness Baha'u'llah expressed the  oneness of humankind whereas in all religious teachings of the past, the  human world has been represented as divided into two parts, one known as  the people of the Book of God or the pure tree and the other the people of  infidelity and error or the evil tree. The former were considered as  belonging to the faithful and the others to the hosts of the irreligious  and infidel; one part of humanity the recipients of divine mercy and the  other the object of the wrath of their Creator. His Holiness Baha'u'llah  removed this by proclaiming the oneness of the world of humanity and this  principle is specialized in His teachings for He has submerged all mankind  in the sea of divine generosity. Some are asleep; they need to be  awakened. Some are ailing; they need to be healed. Some are immature as  children; they need to be trained. But all are recipients of the bounty  and bestowals of God.    Another new principle revealed by His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the  injunction to investigate truth; that is to say, no man should blindly  follow his ancestors and forefathers. Nay, each must see with his own  eyes, hear with his own ears and investigate the truth himself in order  that he may follow the truth instead of blind acquiescence and imitation  of ancestral beliefs.    His Holiness Baha'u'llah has announced that the foundation of all the  religions of God is one; that oneness is truth and truth is oneness which  does not admit of plurality. This teaching is new and specialized to this  Manifestation.    He sets forth a new principle for this day in the announcement that  religion must be the cause of unity, harmony and agreement among mankind.  If it be the cause of discord and hostility, if it leads to separation and  creates conflict, the absence of religion would be preferable in the  world.    Furthermore He proclaims that religion must be in harmony with science and  reason. If it does not conform to science and reconcile with reason it is  superstition. Down to the present day it has been customary for man to  accept a religious teaching even though it were not in accord with human  reason and judgment. The harmony of religious belief with reason is a new  vista which Baha'u'llah"]]]
