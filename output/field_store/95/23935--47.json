Id ex  itinere oppugnare conatus, quod vacuum ab defensoribus esse audiebat,  propter latitudinem fossae murique altitudinem paucis defendentihus  expugnare non potuit. Castris munitis vineas agere quaeque ad oppugnandum  usui erant comparare coepit. Interim omnis ex fuga Suessionum multitudo  in oppidum proxima nocte convenit. Celeriter vineis ad oppidum actis,  aggere iacto turribusque constitutis, magnitudine operum, quae neque  viderant ante Galli neque audierant, et celeritate Romanorum permoti  legatos ad Caesarem de deditione mittunt et petentibus Remis ut  conservarentur impetrant.      Caesar, obsidibus acceptis primis civitatis atque ipsius Galbae regis  duobus filiis armisque omnibus ex oppido traditis, in deditionem  Suessiones accipit exercitumque in Bellovacos ducit. Qui cum se suaque  omnia in oppidum Bratuspantium contulissent atque ab eo oppido Caesar cum  exercitu circiter milia passuum V abesset, omnes maiores natu ex oppido  egressi manus ad Caesarem tendere et voce significare coeperunt sese in  eius fidem ac potestatem venire neque contra populum Romanum armis  contendere. Item, cum ad oppidum accessisset castraque ibi poneret, pueri  mulieresque ex muro passis mallibus suo more pacem ab Romanis petierunt.      Pro his Diviciacus (nam post discessum Belgarum dimissis Haeduorum  copiis ad Cum reverterat) facit verba: Bellovacos omni tempore in fide  atque amicitia civitatis Haeduae fuisse; impulsos ab suis principibus, qui  dicerent Haeduos a Caesare in servitutem redacto. omnes indignitates  contumeliasque perferre, et ab Haeduis defecisse et populo Romano bellum  intulisse. Qui eius consilii principes fuissent, quod intellegerent  quantam calamitatem civitati intulissent, in Britanniam profugisse.    Petere non solum Bellovacos, sed etiam pro his Haeduos, ut sua clementia  ac mansuetudine in eos utatur. Quod si fecerit, Haeduorum auctoritatem  apud omnes Belgas amplificaturum, quorum auxiliis atque opibus, si qua  bella inciderint, sustentare consuerint.      Caesar honoris Diviciaci atque Haeduorum causa sese eos in fidem  recepturum et conservaturum dixit, et quod erat civitas magna inter Belgas  auctoritate atque hominum multitudine praestabat, DC obsides poposcit.    His traditis omnibusque armis ex oppido conlatis, ab eo loco in fines  Ambianorum pervenit; qui se suaque omnia sine mora dediderunt. Eorum  fines Nervii attingebant. Quorum de natura moribusque Caesar cum  quaereret, sic reperiebat: nullum esse aditum ad eos mercatoribus; nihil  pati vini reliquarumque rerum ad luxuriam pertinentium inferri, quod his  rebus relanguescere animos eorum et remitti virtutem existimarent; esse  homines feros magnaeque virtutis; increpitare atque incusare reliquos  Belgas, qui se populo Romano dedidissent patriamque virtutem proiecissent;  confirmare sese neque legatos missuros neque ullam condicionem pacis  accepturos.      Cum per eorum fines triduum iter fecisset, inveniebat ex captivis  Sabim flumen a castris suis non amplius milibus passuum X abesse; trans id  flumen omnes Nervios consedisse adventumque ibi Romanorum expectare una  cum Atrebatibus et Viromanduis, finitimis suis (nam his utrisque  persuaserant uti eandem belli fortunam experirentur); expectari etiam ab  iis Atuatucorum copias atque esse in itinere; mulieres quique per aetatem  ad pugnam inutiles viderentur in eum locum coniecisse quo propter paludes  exercitui aditus non esset.      His rebus cognitis, exploratores centurionesque praemittit qui locum  castris idoneum deligant. Cum ex dediticiis Belgis reliquisque Gallis  complures Caesarem secuti una iter facerent, quidam ex his, ut postea ex  captivis cognitum est, eorum dierum consuetudine itineris nostri exercitus  perspecta, nocte ad Nervios pervenerunt atque his demonstrarunt inter  singulas legiones impedimentorum magnum numerum intercedere, neque esse  quicquam negotii, cum prima legio in castra venisset reliquaeque legiones  magnum spatium abessent, hanc sub sarcinis adoriri; qua pulsa  impedimentisque direptis, futurum ut reliquae contra consistere non  auderent. Adiuvabat etiam eorum collsilium qui rem deferebant quod Nervii  antiquitus, cum equitatu nihil possent (neque enim ad hoc tempus ei rei  student, sed quicquid possunt, pedestribus valent copiis), quo facilius  finitimorum equitatum, si praedandi causa ad eos venissent, impedirent,  teneris arboribus incisis atque inflexis crebrisque in latitudinem ramis  enatis [et] rubis sentibusque interiectis effecerant ut instar muri hae  saepes munimentum praeberent, quo non modo non intrari sed ne perspici  quidem posset. His rebus cum iter agminis nostri impediretur, non  omittendum sibi consilium Nervii existimaverunt.      Loci natura erat haec, quem locum nostri castris delegerant. Collis  ab summo aequaliter declivis ad flumen Sabim, quod supra nominavimus,  vergebat. Ab eo flumine pari acclivitate collis nascebatur adversus huic  et contrarius, passus circiter CC infimus apertus, ab superiore parte  silvestris, ut non facile introrsus perspici posset. Intra eas silvas  hostes in occulto sese continebant; in aperto loco secundum flumen paucae  stationes equitum videbantur. Fluminis erat altitudo pedum circiter  trium.      Caesar equitatu praemisso subsequebatur omnibus copiis; sed ratio  ordoque agminis aliter se habebat ac Belgae ad Nervios detulerant. Nam  quod hostibus adpropinquabat, consuetudine sua Caesar VI legiones  expeditas ducebat; post eas totius exercitus impedimenta conlocarat; inde  duae legiones quae proxime conscriptae erant totum agmen claudebant  praesidioque impedimentis erant. Equites nostri cum funditoribus  sagittariisque flumen transgressi cum hostium equitatu proelium  commiserunt. Cum se illi identidem in silvis ad suos reciperent ac rursus  ex silva in nostros impetum facerent, neque nostri longius quam quem ad  finem porrecta [ac] loca aperta pertinebant cedentes insequi auderent,  interim legiones VI quae primae venerant, opere dimenso, castra munire  coeperunt. Ubi prima impedimenta nostri exercitus ab iis qui in silvis  abditi latebant visa sunt, quod tempus inter eos committendi proelii  convenerat, ut intra silvas aciem ordinesque constituerant atque ipsi sese  confirmaverant, subito omnibus copiis provolaverunt impetumque in nostros  equites fecerunt. His facile pulsis ac proturbatis, incredibili  celeritate ad flumen decucurrerunt, ut paene uno tempore et ad silvas et  in flumine [et iam in manibus nostris] hostes viderentur. Eadem autem  celeritate adverso colle ad nostra castra atque eos qui in opere occupati  erant contenderunt.      Caesari omnia uno tempore erant agenda: vexillum proponendum, quod  erat insigne, cum ad arma concurri oporteret; signum tuba dandum; ab opere  revocandi milites; qui paulo longius aggeris petendi causa processerant  arcessendi; acies instruenda; milites cohortandi; signum dandum. Quarum  rerum magnam partem temporis brevitas et incursus hostium impediebat. His  difficultatibus duae res erant subsidio, scientia atque usus militum, quod  superioribus proeliis exercitati quid fieri oporteret non minus commode  ipsi sibi praescribere quam ab aliis doceri poterant, et quod ab opere  singulisque legionibus singulos legatos Caesar discedere nisi munitis  castris vetuerat. Hi propter propinquitatem et celeritatem hostium nihil  iam Caesaris imperium expectabant, sed per se quae videbantur  administrabant.      Caesar, necessariis rebus imperatis, ad cohortandos milites, quam [in]  partem fors obtulit, decucurrit et ad legionem decimam devenit. Milites  non longiore oratione cohortatus quam uti suae pristinae virtutis memoriam  retinerent neu perturbarentur animo hostiumque impetum fortiter  sustinerent, quod non longius hostes aberant quam quo telum adigi posset,  proelii committendi signum dedit. Atque in alteram item cohortandi causa  profectus pugnantibus occurrit. Temporis tanta fuit exiguitas hostiumque  tam paratus ad dimicandum animus ut non modo ad insignia accommodanda sed  etiam ad galeas induendas scutisque tegimenta detrahenda tempus defuerit.    Quam quisque ab opere in partem casu devenit quaeque prima signa  conspexit, ad haec constitit, ne in quaerendis suis pugnandi tempus  dimitteret.      Instructo exercitu magis ut loci natura [delectusque collis] et  necessitas temporis quam ut rei militaris ratio atque ordo postulabat, cum  diversae legiones aliae alia in parte hostibus resisterent saepibusque  densissimis, ut ante demonstravimus, interiectis prospectus impediretur,  neque certa subsidia conlocari neque quid in quaque parte opus esset  provideri neque ab uno omnia imperia administrari poterant. Itaque in  tanta rerum iniquitate fortunae quoque eventus varii sequebantur.      Legionis VIIII. et X. milites, ut in sinistra parte aciei  constiterant, pilis emissis cursu ac lassitudine exanimatos vulneribusque  confectos Atrebates (nam his ea pars obvenerat) celeriter ex loco  superiore in flumen compulerunt et transire conantes insecuti gladiis  magnam partem eorum impeditam interfecerunt. Ipsi transire flumen non  dubitaverunt et in locum iniquum progressi rursus resistentes hostes  redintegrato proelio in fugam coniecerunt. Item alia in parte diversae  duae legiones, XI. et VIII., profligatis Viromanduis, quibuscum erant  congressae, ex loco superiore in ipsis fluminis ripis proeliabantur. At  totis fere castris a fronte et a sinistra parte nudatis, cum in dextro  cornu legio XII. et non magno ab ea intervallo VII. constitisset, omnes  Nervii confertissimo agmine duce Boduognato, qui summam imperii tenebat,  ad eum locum contenderunt; quorum pars [ab] aperto latere legiones  circumvenire, pars summum castrorum locum petere coepit.      Eodem tempore equites nostri levisque armaturae pedites, qui cum iis  una fuerant, quos primo hostium impetu pulsos dixeram, cum se in castra  reciperent, adversis hostibus occurrebant ac rursus aliam in partem fugam  petebant; et"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21840"],[0,"Woman (#8)"],[1,"reason for this. Well developed breasts indicate that the  other sexual organs are well developed and that the woman will make a  satisfactory wife and satisfactory mother. Considering then the  importance of the breasts in attracting a husband and their function  in nursing the young, also their erogenous properties, it is perfectly  proper to class them among the reproductive organs.      SUBCHAPTER C    THE ORGASM    The culmination of the act of sexual intercourse is called the orgasm.  It is the moment at which the pleasurable sensation is at its highest  point, the body experiences a thrill, there is a spasmodic contraction  in the genital organs, and there is a secretion of fluid from the  genital glands and mucous membranes. This fluid in women is not a  vital fluid like the semen in man; it is merely mucus, and in some  women it is very slight in amount or altogether absent. Adult women  who live without sexual relations occasionally have sexual or erotic  dreams; that is, they dream that they are in the company of men,  playing or having relations with them. Such dreams are usually  accompanied by an orgasm or an orgastic feeling, and by a discharge of  mucus, the same as in sexual intercourse. Such a discharge of mucus  during sleep is called an emission or pollution.    In the male sex pollutions play an important role (see the author's  \"Sex Knowledge for men\"), because the semen is a vital fluid, and if  it is lost too frequently the system is put under a heavy drain. In  boys and men the pollutions or night losses may occur several times a  week or even every night, or several times a night. When they occur  with such frequency the man may become a wreck. Not so with women.  First, pollutions or night dreams in women are much more rare than  they are in men; and second, as just mentioned, the fluid secreted by  woman during intercourse or during an erotic dream is not of a vital  character, as the semen is in man; it is mucus, and the secretion of a  mucous fluid, even if somewhat excessive, does not constitute a drain  on the system. For this reason women can stand frequently repeated sex  relations and emissions or pollutions much better than men can.      SUBCHAPTER D    THE SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERS    The sex organs constitute the primary sex characters. It is they that  distinguish primarily one sex from another. But there are numerous  other sex characters or sex differences which while not so important  serve to differentiate the sexes, at the same time forming points of  attraction between one sex and another. For instance, the beard and  mustache are a distinct male characteristic and constitute one of the  secondary male sex characters. The secondary sex characters are very  numerous; one might say that each one of the billions of cells in the  body bears the impress of the sex to which it belongs.    First, the skeleton. The entire female skeleton differs from the male  skeleton; all the bones are smaller and more gracile; the pelvis, as  we have seen before, is shallower and wider. Then the muscles are  smaller and more rounded. The entire contour of the body is rounded  rather than angular as in man. The skin is finer, softer, more  delicate. The hair on the head is longer and of a finer texture, while  over the body the hair is also finer and less abundant. The voice is  finer, more pleasant, and of a higher pitch (soprano). The breasts are  well developed, and serve an important purpose, while in men they are  rudimentary. The breathing is also different; woman breathes  principally with the upper part of the chest, man with the lower. The  brain is smaller and its convolutions somewhat less complex in woman.    Woman differs considerably from man not only physically, as we have  seen, but also mentally and emotionally. But into this phase of the  subject we will not enter, except to remark that it is foolish to  speak of the superiority or inferiority of one sex to another. In some  respects man is greatly superior to woman, in others he is inferior;  on the whole the sexes balance one another pretty well, and while the  sexes are not and never will be exactly alike, we have no right to  speak of the inferiority of one sex to another. We recognize that the  sexes are different, but they complement one another, and the claim of  the reactionary and of the woman-hater that woman is an inferior  creature is just as senseless as is the claim made by some  ultra-militant feminists that woman is the superior and man the  inferior.    FOOTNOTES:    [3] The ovum is really the fully mature egg ready for fecundation;  before maturity it should not be called ovum but ooecyte; and in  advanced treatises it is so referred to. But here ovum will do for  both the unripe and ripe egg.          CHAPTER FOUR    THE SEX INSTINCT     Universality of the Sex Instinct--Not Responsible for Our Thoughts    and Feelings.      THE sex instinct, which runs all through nature from the lowest animal  to the highest, is the inborn impulse, craving or desire which one sex  has for the other: the male for the female and the female for the  male. This instinct, this desire for the opposite sex, which is born  with us and which manifests itself at a very early age, is not  anything to be ashamed of. There is nothing disgraceful, nothing  sinful in it. It is a normal, natural, healthy instinct, implanted in  us by nature for various reasons, and absolutely indispensable for the  perpetuation of the race. If there were anything to be ashamed of, it  would be the lack of this sex instinct, for without it the race would  quickly die out.    =Not Responsible for Thoughts and Feelings.= It is necessary to  impress this point, because many girls and women, whose minds have  been perverted by a vicious so-called morality, worry themselves to  illness, brood and become hypochondriac because they think they have  committed a grievous sin in experiencing a desire for sexual relations  or for the embrace of a certain man. Altogether it is necessary to  impress upon the growing girl, when the occasion presents itself, that  a thought or a feeling can never be sinful. An action may be, but a  thought or a feeling cannot. Why? Because we are not responsible for  our thoughts and feelings; they are not under our control. Though it  does not mean that when they do arise we are to give them full sway.  We should attempt to combat them and drive them away, but there is  nothing to be ashamed of, because for their origin we are not  responsible.    =Responsible for Actions.= Our actions are under our control, to a  certain extent at least, and if we do a bad or injurious act, we have  committed a sin and are morally responsible. The _desire_ for the  sexual act is no more sinful than the desire for food is when one is  hungry. But the performance of the act may, under certain  circumstances, be as sinful as the eating of food which the hungry man  obtained by robbing another fellow-being, just as poor as himself.    I am not preaching to you. But I am not an extremist nor a hypocrite.  I am advocating neither asceticism nor licentiousness. One is as bad,  or almost as bad, as the other.    What I am trying to do is to inculcate in your minds, if possible, a  sane, well-balanced view of all things sexual.    For I believe that wrong, perverted views of the physiology and  hygiene of the sex act and of sex morality, that is, the proper  relationship of the sexes, are responsible for untold misery, for  incalculable suffering. Both sexes suffer, but the female sex suffers  more. The woman always pays more. This is due to her natural  disabilities (menstruation, pregnancy, lactation), to her age-long  repression, to the fact that she must be sought but never seek, and to  her economic dependence.    For the above reasons, sex instruction is a matter of double  importance to woman--this fact has been emphasized in the first  chapter. But woman's disabilities impose upon us another duty:  _because_ she carries the heaviest burden, _because_ she always pays  more dearly than the man, it becomes incumbent upon man to treat her  with special consideration, with genuine kindness and chivalry.          CHAPTER FIVE    PUBERTY     Physical Changes in Puberty--Physical Changes in the Genital    Organs and in the Rest of the Body--Psychic Changes--Puberty and    Adolescence--Nubility.      Puberty is the most wonderful, the most significant period in a girl's  life. Important as it is in a boy's life and development, it is still  more so in a girl's. At this period there are often laid the  foundations which either make or mar the girl's future life.    The meaning of the word puberty is maturity. It is the period at which  the girl and the boy reach sexual maturity; in other words, the period  at which the sex glands of the boy begin to generate spermatozoa, and  the sex glands of the girl begin to mature and expel eggs or ova; with  the girl puberty is marked by an additional phenomenon, which has no  analogue in the boy, namely, menstruation.    =Physical Changes.= The word puberty is derived from the word _puber_,  which in Latin means mature, ripe. But the word puber is itself  derived from the word _pubes_, which in Latin means fine hair or  down. For at this period of maturity all mammals (that is animals  which have breasts and nurse their young) begin to develop a growth of  hair. You know that our entire body, with the exception of the palms  of the hands and the soles of the feet, is covered with innumerable  hair follicles, and from our birth our entire body, with the exception  named, is covered with fine hair. The hair may be too delicate to be  seen, but it is there, and with a magnifying glass you can see it  without any trouble. But at puberty the hair increases in thickness  and in quantity, and becomes abundant in places where it was hardly  noticeable before--the upper lip and face in boys, and the armpits and  lower"]]]
