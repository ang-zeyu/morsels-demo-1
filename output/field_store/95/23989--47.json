[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#8)"],[1,"ACID VOLTAMETER.--In Fig. 41 is shown a simple  form of sulphuric acid voltameter, to illustrate the first method. A is  a jar, tightly closed by a cover (B). Within is a pair of platinum  plates (C, C), each having a wire (D) through the cover. The cover has a  vertical glass tube (E) through it, which extends down to the bottom of  the jar, the electrolyte therein being a weak solution of sulphuric  acid. When a current passes through the wires (D), the solution is  partially decomposed--that is, converted into gas, which passes up into  the vacant space (F) above the liquid, and, as it cannot escape, it  presses the liquid downwardly, and causes the latter to flow upwardly  into the tube (E). It is then an easy matter, after the current is on  for a certain time, to determine its strength by the height of the  liquid in the tube.    HOW TO MAKE A COPPER VOLTAMETER.--The second, or copper voltameter, is  shown in Fig. 42. The glass jar (A) contains a solution of copper  sulphate, known in commerce as blue vitriol. A pair of copper plates  (B, B') are placed in this solution, each being provided with a  connecting wire (C). When a current passes through the wires (C), one  copper plate (B) is eaten away and deposited on the other plate (B'). It  is then an easy matter to take out the plates and find out how much in  weight B' has gained, or how much B has lost.    In this way, in comparing the strength of, say, two separate currents,  one should have each current pass through the voltameter the same length  of time as the other, so as to obtain comparative results.    It is not necessary, in the first and second methods, to consider the  shapes, the sizes of the plates or the distances between them. In the  first method the gas produced, within a given time, will be the same,  and in the second method the amount deposited or eaten away will be the  same under all conditions.    DISADVANTAGES OF THE GALVANOSCOPE.--With the third method (using the  galvanoscope) it is necessary, in order to get a positively correct  reading instrument, to follow an absolutely accurate plan in  constructing each part, in every detail, and great care must be  exercised, particularly in winding. It is necessary also to be very  careful in selecting the sizes of wire used and in the number of turns  made in the coils.    This is equally true of the fourth method, using the electro-magnet,  because the magnetic pull is dependent upon the size of wire from which  the coils are made and the number of turns of wire.    OBJECTIONS TO THE CALORIMETER.--The calorimeter, or sixth method, has  the same objection. The galvanoscope and electro-magnet do not respond  equally to all currents, and this is also true, even to a greater  extent, with the calorimeter.          CHAPTER VI    VOLTS, AMPERES, OHMS AND WATTS      UNDERSTANDING TERMS.--We must now try to ascertain the meaning of some  of the terms so frequently used in connection with electricity. If you  intended to sell or measure produce or goods of any kind, it would be  essential to know how many pints or quarts are contained in a gallon, or  in a bushel, or how many inches there are in a yard, and you also ought  to know just what the quantity term _bushel_ or the measurement _yard_  means.    INTENSITY AND QUANTITY.--Electricity, while it has no weight, is capable  of being measured by means of its intensity, or by its quantity. Light  may be measured or tested by its brilliancy. If one light is of less  intensity than another and both of them receive their impulses from the  same source, there must be something which interferes with that light  which shows the least brilliancy. Electricity can also be interfered  with, and this interference is called _resistance_.    VOLTAGE.--Water may be made to flow with greater or less force, or  velocity, through a pipe, the degree of same depending upon the height  of the water which supplies the pipe. So with electricity. It may pass  over a wire with greater or less force under one condition than another.  This force is called voltage. If we have a large pipe, a much greater  quantity of water will flow through it than will pass through a small  pipe, providing the pressure in each case is alike. This quantity in  electricity is called _amperage_.    In the case of water, a column 1\" x 1\", 28 inches in height, weighs 1  pound; so that if a pipe 1 inch square draws water from the bottom it  flows with a pressure of 1 pound. If the pipe has a measurement of 2  square inches, double the quantity of water will flow therefrom, at the  same pressure.    AMPERAGE.--If, on the other hand, we have a pipe 1 inch square, and  there is a depth of 56 inches of water in the reservoir, we shall get as  much water from the reservoir as though we had a pipe of 2 square inches  drawing water from a reservoir which is 28 inches deep.    MEANING OF WATTS.--It is obvious, therefore, that if we multiply the  height of the water in inches with the area of the pipe, we shall obtain  a factor which will show how much water is flowing.    Here are two examples:    1. 28 inches = height of the water in the reservoir.    2 square inches = size of the pipe.  Multiply 28 x 2 = 56.    2. 56 = height of the water in the reservoir.  1 square inch = size of the pipe.  Multiply 56 x 1 = 56.    Thus the two problems are equal.    A KILOWATT.--Now, in electricity, remembering that the height of the  water corresponds with _voltage_ in electricity, and the size of the  pipe with _amperage_, if we multiply volts by amperes, or amperes by  volts, we get a result which is indicated by the term _watts_. One  thousand of these watts make a kilowatt, and the latter is the standard  of measurement by which a dynamo or motor is judged or rated.    Thus, if we have 5 amperes and 110 volts, the result of multiplying them  would be 550 watts, or 5 volts and 110 amperes would produce 550 watts.    A STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT.--But with all this we must have some  standard. A bushel measure is of a certain size, and a foot has a  definite length, so in electricity there is a recognized force and  quantity which are determined as follows:    THE AMPERE STANDARD.--It is necessary, first, to determine what an  ampere is. For this purpose a standard solution of nitrate of silver is  used, and a current of electricity is passed through this solution. In  doing so the current deposits silver at the rate of 0.001118 grains per  second for each ampere.    THE VOLTAGE STANDARD.--In order to determine the voltage we must know  something of _resistance_. Different metals do not transmit a current  with equal ease. The size of a conductor, also, is an important factor  in the passage of a current. A large conductor will transmit a current  much better than a small conductor. We must therefore have a standard  for the _ohm_, which is the measure of resistance.    THE OHM.--It is calculated in this way: There are several standards, but  the one most generally employed is the _International Ohm_. To determine  it, by this system, a column of pure mercury, 106.3 millimeters long and  weighing 14.4521 grams, is used. This would make a square tube about 94  inches long, and a little over 1/25 of an inch in diameter. The  resistance to a current flow in such a column would be equal to 1 ohm.    CALCULATING THE VOLTAGE.--In order to arrive at the voltage we must use  a conductor, which, with a resistance of 1 ohm, will produce 1 ampere.  It must be remembered that the volt is the practical unit of  electro-motive force.    While it would be difficult for the boy to conduct these experiments in  the absence of suitable apparatus, still, it is well to understand  thoroughly how and why these standards are made and used.          CHAPTER VII    PUSH BUTTONS, SWITCHES, ANNUNCIATORS, BELLS AND  LIKE APPARATUS      SIMPLE SWITCHES.--We have now gone over the simpler or elementary  outlines of electrical phenomena, and we may commence to do some of the  practical work in the art. We need certain apparatus to make  connections, which will be constructed first.    A TWO-POLE SWITCH.--A simple two-pole switch for a single line is made  as follows:    A base block (A, Fig. 43) 3 inches long, 2 inches wide and 3/4 inch  thick, has on it, at one end, a binding screw (B), which holds a pair of  fingers (C) of brass or copper, these fingers being bent upwardly and so  arranged as to serve as fingers to hold a switch bar (D) between them.  This bar is also of copper or brass and is pivoted to the fingers. Near  the other end of the base is a similar binding screw (E) and fingers (F)  to receive the blade of the switch bar. The bar has a handle (G) of  wood. The wires are attached to the respective binding screws (B, E).    DOUBLE-POLE SWITCH.--A double-pole switch or a switch for a double line  is shown in Fig. 44. This is made similar in all respects to the one  shown in Fig. 43, excepting that there are two switch blades (A, A)  connected by a cross bar (B) of insulating material, and this bar  carries the handle (C).    [Illustration: _Fig. 43._ TWO-POLE SWITCH]    [Illustration: _Fig. 44._ DOUBLE-POLE SWITCH]    Other types of switch will be found very useful. In Fig. 45 is a simple  sliding switch in which the base block has, at one end, a pair of copper  plates (A, B), each held at one end to the base by a binding screw (C),  and having a bearing or contact surface (D) at its other end. At the  other end of the base is a copper plate (E) held by a binding screw (F),  to the inner end of which plate is hinged a swinging switch blade (G),  the free end of which is adapted to engage with the plates (A, B).    [Illustration: _Fig. 45._ SLIDING SWITCH]    SLIDING SWITCH.--This sliding switch form may have the contact plates  (A, B and C, Fig. 46) circularly arranged and any number may be located  on the base, so they may be engaged by a single switching lever (H). It  is the form usually adopted for rheostats."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22771"],[0,"Cattle and Their Diseases (#8)"],[1,"crosses were accidental, or due to local circumstances or  individual convenience. Many of these cattle, the descendants of such  crosses, are of a very high order of merit; but to which particular  cross this is due, it is impossible to say. They generally make hardy,  strong, and docile oxen, easily broken to the yoke and quick to work,  with a fair tendency to fatten when well fed; while the cows, though  often ill-shaped, are sometimes remarkably good milkers, especially as  regards the quantity which they give.    Indeed, it has been remarked by excellent judges of stock, that if they  desired to select a dairy of cows for milk for sale, they would make  their selection from cows commonly called native, in preference to  pure-bred animals of any of the established breeds, and that they  believed they should find such a dairy the most profitable.    In color, the natives, made up as already indicated, are exceedingly  various. The old Denmarks, which to a considerable extent laid the  foundation of the stock of Maine and New Hampshire, were light yellow.  The Dutch of New York and the Middle States, were black and white; the  Spanish and Welsh were generally black; the Devons, which are supposed  to have laid the foundation of the stock of some of the States, were  red. Crosses of the Denmark with the Spanish and Welsh naturally made a  dark brindle; crosses of the Devon often made a lighter or yellowish  brindle while the more recent importations of Jerseys and short horns  have generally produced a beautiful spotted progeny. The deep red has  long been a favorite color in New England; but the prejudice in its  favor is fast giving way to more variegated colors.    Among the earlier importations into this country were also several  varieties of hornless cattle, which have been kept measurably distinct  in some sections; or where they have been crossed with the common stock  there has been a tendency to produce hornless grades. These are not  unfrequently known as \"buffalo cattle.\" They were, in many cases,  supposed to belong to the Galloway breed; or, which is more likely, to  the Suffolk dun, a variety of the Galloway, and a far better milking  stock than the Galloways, from which, it sprung. These polled, or  hornless cattle vary in color and qualities, but they are usually very  good milkers when well kept, and many of them fatten well, and attain  good weight.    The Hungarian cattle have also been imported, to some extent, into  different parts of the country, and have been crossed upon the natives  with some success. Many other strains of blood from different breeds  have also contributed to build up the common stock of the country of the  present day; and there can be no question that its appearance and value  have been largely improved during the last quarter of a century, nor  that improvements are still in progress which will lead to satisfactory  results in the future.    But, though we already have an exceedingly valuable foundation for  improvement, no one will pretend to deny that our cattle, as a whole,  are susceptible of it in many respects. They possess neither the size,  the symmetry, nor the early maturity of the short horns; they do not, as  a general thing, possess the fineness of bone, the beauty of form and  color, nor the activity of the Devons or the Herefords; they do not  possess that uniform richness of milk, united with generous quality, of  the Ayrshires, nor the surpassing richness of milk of the Jerseys: but,  above all, they do not possess the power of transmitting the many good  qualities which they often have to their offspring--which is the  characteristic of all well established breeds.    It is equally certain, in the opinion of many good judges, that the  dairy stock of the country has not been materially improved in its  intrinsic good qualities during the last thirty or forty years. This may  not be true of certain sections, where the dairy has been made a special  object of pursuit, and where the custom of raising the best male calves  of the neighborhood, or those that came from the best dairy cows, and  then of using only the best formed bulls, has long prevailed. Although  in this way some progress has, doubtless, been made, there are still  room and need for more. More attention must be paid to correct  principles of breeding before the satisfactory results which every  farmer should strive to reach can be attained.    Having glanced generally at the leading breeds of cattle in Great  Britain, and examined, more in detail, the various breeds in the United  States, the next subject demanding attention is,      THE NATURAL HISTORY OF CATTLE.

GESTATION.    The usual period of pregnancy in a cow is nine calendar months, and  something over: at times as much as three weeks. With one thousand and  thirty one cows, whose gestations were carefully observed in France, the  average period was about two hundred and eighty-five days.      FORMATION OF TEETH.    It is of the utmost importance to be able to judge of the age of a cow.  Few farmers wish to purchase a cow for the dairy after she has passed  her prime, which will ordinarily be at the age of nine or ten years,  varying, of course, according to care, feeding, &c., in the earlier part  of her life.    The common method of forming an estimate of the age of cattle is by an  examination of the horn. At three years old, as a general rule, the  horns are perfectly smooth; after this, a ring appears near the nob, and  annually afterward a new one is formed, so that, by adding two years to  the first ring, the age is calculated. This is a very uncertain mode of  judging. The rings are distinct only in the cow; and it is well known  that if a heifer goes to bull when she is two years old, or a little  before or after that time, a change takes place in the horn and the  first ring appears; so that a real three-year-old would carry the mark  of a four-year-old.    [Illustration: TEETH AT BIRTH.]    The rings on the horns of a bull are either not seen until five, or they  cannot be traced at all; while in the ox they do not appear till he is  five years old, and then are often very indistinct. In addition to this,  it is by no means an uncommon practice to file the horns, so as to make  them smooth, and to give the animal the appearance of being much younger  than it really is. This is, therefore, an exceedingly fallacious guide,  and cannot be relied upon by any one with the degree of confidence  desired.    [Illustration: SECOND WEEK.]    The surest indication of the age in cattle, as in the horse, is given by  the teeth.    The calf, at birth, will usually have two incisor or front teeth--in  some cases just appearing through the gums; in others, fully set,  varying as the cow falls short of, or exceeds, her regular time of  calving. If she overruns several days, the teeth will have set and  attained considerable size, as appears in the cut representing teeth at  birth. During the second week, a tooth will usually be added on each  side, and the mouth will generally appear as in the next cut; and before  the end of the third week, the animal will generally have six incisor  teeth, as denoted in the cut representing teeth at the third week; and  in a week from that time the full number of incisors will have appeared,  as seen in the next cut.    [Illustration: THREE WEEKS.]    [Illustration: MONTH.]    [Illustration: FIVE TO EIGHT MONTHS.]    [Illustration: TEN MONTHS.]    [Illustration: TWELVE MONTHS.]    [Illustration: FIFTEEN MONTHS.]    These teeth are temporary, and are often called milk-teeth. Their edge  is very sharp; and as the animal begins to live upon more solid food,  this edge becomes worn, showing the bony part of the tooth"]]]
