Few people have any idea what constitute the essentials of a  book's form and proportions. Yet our old standards, in manuscript and  print, demand \"that the length of a printed page should have relation to  its width, and that the top should not exceed half the bottom margin,  and that the front should be double the back margin.\"    The papermaker comes in for a large share of blame, but the remedy lies  only in the hands of the consumer, who must insist on receiving good and  durable paper. \"The ink-maker is a sinner of the first magnitude.\" The  first printing inks are still bright, clean, and beautiful after four  hundred years; but who will give any such warrant to even the best inks  of the present day? Mr. Stevens pronounces the sallow inks of our day as  offensive to sight as they are to smell. The bookbinder is adjudged  equal in mischief to any other of the ten sinners, and the rest are  called upon to combine to prevent their books from being spoiled in  these last hands.    The consumer, after all, is the person most to blame, for he has the  power to control all the rest. Or, in the critic's closing words: \"Many  of our new books are unnecessarily spoiled, and it matters little  whether this or that fault be laid to this or that sinner. The  publisher, the printer, or the binder may sometimes, nay, often does, if  he can, shift the burden of his sins to the shoulders of his neighbor,  but all the faults finally will come back on the consumer if he  tolerates this adulteration longer.\"    The great constructive feature of Mr. Stevens's address, which is one  that brings it absolutely up to date, is his call for a school of  typography, which shall teach a recognized grammar of book manufacture,  especially printing, a grammar as standard as Lindley Murray's. He  believes that the art of bookmaking cannot be held to the practice of  the laws of proportion, taste, and workmanship, which were settled once  for all in the age of the scribes and the first printers, without the  existence and pressure of some recognized authority. Such an authority,  he holds, would be furnished by a school of typography. This, as we  interpret it, would be not necessarily a school for journeymen, but a  school for those who are to assume the responsibility too often thrown  upon the journeymen, the masters of book production. With a large annual  output of books taken up by a public none too deeply versed in the  constituents of a well-made book, there would seem to be much hope for  printing as an art from the existence of such an institution, which  would be critical in the interest of sound construction, and one might  well wish that the course in printing recently established at Harvard  might at some time be associated with the name of its prophet of a  generation ago, Henry Stevens of Vermont.          BOOKS AS A LIBRARIAN WOULD LIKE THEM      The librarian is in a position more than any one else to know the  disabilities of books. The author is interested in his fame and his  emoluments, the publisher in his reputation and his profits. To each of  these parties the sales are the chief test. But the librarian's interest  in the book begins after the sale, and it continues through the entire  course of the book's natural life. His interest, moreover, is all-round;  he is concerned with the book's excellence in all respects,  intellectual, esthetic, and physical. He is the one who has to live with  it, literally to keep house with it; and his reputation is in a way  involved with its character. He may, therefore, be allowed for once to  have his say as to how he would like to have books made.    If a book is worth writing at all, it is worth writing three times:  first to put down the author's ideas, secondly to condense their  expression into the smallest possible compass, and thirdly so to arrange  them that they shall be most easily taken into the mind, putting them  not necessarily into logical order, but into psychological order. If the  author will do this and can add the touch of genius, or--shall we  say?--can suffuse his work with the quality of genius, then he has made  an addition to literature. That, among all the books which the librarian  has to care for, he finds so few that he can call additions to  literature is one of his grievances. The three processes may, indeed,  by a practiced hand be performed as one. The librarian is only anxious  that they be performed and that he have the benefit.    With the publisher the librarian feels that he can speak still more  bluntly than with the author, for it is against the publisher that the  librarian cherishes one of his greatest grievances, the necessity of  supplying four times the amount of storage room that ought to be  required. I have before me two books, one larger than the other in every  way and four times as thick. Yet the smaller book is printed in larger  type, has twice as many words on a page, and has twice as many pages.  This is, of course, an exceptional contrast, but a difference of four  times between the actual and the possible is by no means unusual. When  one considers that in most of our libraries it costs, all told, a dollar  to shelve a volume, one realizes that the librarian has against the  publisher a grievance that can be put into the language of commerce. If  every book is occupying a dollar's worth of space, which ought to  accommodate three others, then, gentlemen publishers, in swelling your  books to catch the public eye, you have taken from us far more than you  put into your own pockets from your sales to us. You have made our book  storage four times as costly and unwieldy as it ought to be; but you  have done worse than this, you have sold us perishable instead of  durable goods. You have cheapened every element of the book--paper, ink,  and binding--so that, while we begin the twentieth century with some  books on our shelves that are over four hundred years old and some that  are less than one, the only books among them that have any chance of  seeing the twenty-first century are those that will then be five hundred  years old; the books that might have been a century old will then, like  their makers, be dust. It seems to the librarian that you, who have  taken it upon yourselves to direct the service to be rendered to men by  the \"art preservative of all arts,\" have assumed very lightly your  responsibility for the future's knowledge of our time. You may and do  answer that, as the records begin to perish, the most important of them  will be reprinted, and the world will be the better off for the loss of  the rest. To this it may be rejoined that you give the distant future no  chance to revise the judgments of a rather near future, and that vast  quantities of material which would be read with eagerness by future  generations and which would be carefully preserved if it were durable,  will not be reprinted, whatever its value. We may be sure that the daily  papers of the present year will never be reprinted; the world of the  future will be too busy, not to speak of the cost; yet what a series of  human documents will disappear in their destruction! If a part of the  professional obligation which you assumed in making yourselves  responsible for the issues of the press is to transmit the record of  this generation to later time, then it seems to me that you have in  great measure betrayed your trust and have so far brought to naught the  labors of your comrade, the librarian, in the conservation of  literature. Also you compel him to pay for unnecessary rebindings which  can hardly be made, so poor is the stock you furnish the binder; yet on  this point you have shown some indications of a change of heart, and I  will pass it over. Perhaps you have finally come to realize that every  cent paid for rebinding is taken out of your gross receipts. I will not  speak of the books that you ought never to have published, the books  that are not books; most of these the librarian can avoid buying, but  sometimes a book is just \"ower gude for banning,\" and he has to take it  and catalogue it and store it, and take account of it and rearrange it,  and, after all, get scolded by his authorities or ridiculed by the  public for housing so much rubbish. The author is responsible with you  here, but your own individual responsibility is enough for any shoulders  to bear.    To the printer the librarian would say: since wishing is easy, let us  imagine that what ought always to happen is happening regularly instead  of rarely, namely, that the author produces a book worth printing and  that the publisher leaves you free to put it into a worthy form. This is  the opportunity that you have always been looking for. How are you going  to meet it? Do you know all the elements that you deal with and can you  handle them with a sure touch practically and esthetically? If so, you  will not need any hints from the librarian, and he will order your book  \"sight unseen.\" But still, among the good and right ways of making  books, there may be some that he prefers, and he will ask you, when you  are making books for him and not for private buyers, at least to give  his preferences a hearing. He wants his books no bigger physically than  they need be, and yet he would like to have them of a convenient height,  from seven to nine inches. He would rather have their expansion in  height and width and not in thickness, for the former dimensions up to  ten and a half inches by eight mean no increased demand upon shelf room,  while the thickness of every leaf is taken out of his library's  capacity. He would like to have no wasteful margins and no extreme in  the size of type.

Book-production was still  progressing in the immediate neighbourhood of London. At St. Albans, for  example, over eighty were transcribed under Whethamstede during this  reign, a number which is peculiarly interesting when the degeneracy of  the monasteries is remembered. Neither Edward IV. nor Richard III. seems  to have availed himself of the increasing plenty of books. The library  of the former was a very unimportant affair. From the Wardrobe Account  of this King (1480) we get a few highly interesting facts concerning  book-binding, gildings, and garnishing: 'For vj unces and iij quarters  of silk to the laces and tassels for garnysshing of diverse Bookes,  price the unce xiiij_d._--vij_s._ x_d._ ob.; for the making of xvj laces  and xvj tassels made of the said vj unces and iij of silke, price in  grete ij_s._ vii_d._' These moneys were paid to Alice Claver, a  'sylk-woman.' And again 'to Piers Bauduyn, stacioner, for bynding,  gilding and dressing of a booke called \"Titus Livius,\" xx_s._; for  bynding, gilding and dressing of a booke of the Holy Trinitie, xvj_s._;  for bynding, gilding and dressing of a booke called \"Frossard,\" xvj_s._;  for bynding, gilding and dressing of a booke called the Bible, xvj_s._;  for bynding, gilding and dressing of a booke called \"Le Gouvernement of  Kinges and Princes,\" xvj_s._; for bynding and dressing of the three  smalle bookes of Franche, price in grete vj_s._ viiij_d._; for the  dressing of ij bookes whereof oon is called \"La Forteresse de Foy\" and  the other called the \"Book of Josephus,\" iij_s._ iiij_d._; and for  bynding, gilding and dressing a booke called the \"Bible Historial,\"  xx_s._'    The only incident which calls for special mention in the two next short  reigns is a law, 1 Richard III., 1483, by which it was enacted that if  any of the printers or sellers of printed books--the 'great plenty' of  which came from 'beyond the sea'--'vend them at too high and  unreasonable prices,' then the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or any  of the chief justices of the one bench or the other, were to regulate  the prices.    [Illustration: _Roman Books and Writing Materials._]          [Illustration]    BOOK-HUNTING AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF PRINTING.      I.    THE introduction of printing into this country by Caxton during the  latter half of the fifteenth century had very little immediate effect on  book-collecting. The operations of the press were slow, its patrons few,  and its work controlled by one man. The reproduction of MSS. was  essentially a slow process, but when these transcriptions were finished,  they rarely failed to find a purchaser. Caxton, like Sweynheim and  Pannartz at Subiaco, soon learned the seriousness of over-printing an  edition. Collectors were few, and the introduction of printing did not  very materially add to their number. London, however, soon became a  recognised centre of the trade in books, and Henry VII. patronized, in  his curious fashion, the collecting of them. He read, according to  Bacon, 'most books that were of any worth in the French tongue,' and one  of the most commendable actions of this King was the purchase of the  noble series of vellum copies of the works printed at Paris by Antoine  Verard, now in the British Museum--an act by which he may be said to  have laid the foundation of our great national library. The value of  books at this period is not without interest; but we must confine  ourselves to one or two facts relating to Caxton's books. At his death  in 1492, a copy of the 'Golden Legend' was valued at 6s. 8d. in the  books of the Westminster churchwarden. From a note by Dibdin, it would  seem that the price of Caxtons towards the end of the reign of Henry  VII. was as follows:      'Godfray of Boulogne' (imperfect), ii_s._    Virgil's 'AEneid' (perfect), xij_d._    'Fait of Arms and Chivalry' (perfect), ij_s._ viij_d._    'Chastising of God's Children,' viij_d._    Henry VIII. was undoubtedly a book-lover as well as a book-collector. He  established a library at St. James's. But perhaps it is rather as a  book-disperser that Henry is entitled to notice in this place. The  dissolution of the monasteries is the genesis of book-collecting in  London. The first move in this respect is entitled 'An Act that all  religious houses under the yearly revenue of L200 shall be dissolved and  given to the King and his heirs,' and is dated 1535 (27 Henry VIII.,  cap. 28, ii. 134). The second is dated 1539. Whatever advantages in a  general way the dissolution of the monasteries may have had, its  consequences, so far as regards the libraries, which the monks  considered as among their most cherished possessions, were disastrous  beyond measure. Indeed, we have no conception of our losses. Addressing  himself to Edward VI. in 1549, John Bale, afterwards Bishop of Ossory,  who had but little love for Popery of any description, writes in this  strain: 'Avarice was the other dispatcher which hath made an end both of  our libraries and books . . . to the no small decay of the commonwealth.  A great number of them who purchased those superstitious mansions  [monasteries], reserved of these Library-books, some . . . to scour  their candlesticks, and some to rub their boots; some they sold to the  grocers and soap-sellers, and some they sent over sea to the  bookbinders, not in small numbers, but at times whole shipsfull, to the  wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the universities of this realm  are not all clear in this detestable fact. But cursed is that belly  which seeketh to be fed with so ungodly gains, and so deeply shameth his  natural country. I know a merchantman, which shall at this time be  nameless, that bought the contents of two noble Libraries for forty  shillings price: a shame it is to be spoken. This stuff hath he occupied  in the stead of gray paper by the space of more than these ten years;  and yet he hath store enough for as many years to come. . . . Our  posterity may well curse this wicked fact of our age, this unreasonable  spoil of England's most noble antiquities, unless they be stayed in  time.' Fuller, in his 'Church History of Britain,' quotes Bale's  lamentation, and adds his own testimony on the same subject: 'As brokers  in Long Lane, when they buy an old suit buy the linings together with  the outside, so it was considered meet that such as purchased the  buildings of monasteries should in the same grant have the Libraries  (the stuffing thereof) conveyed unto them. And now these ignorant  owners, so long as they might keep a ledger-book or terrier by direction  thereof to find such straggling acres as belonged unto them, they cared  not to preserve any other monuments. The covers of books, with curious  brass bosses and clasps, intended to protect, proved to betray them,  being the baits of covetousness. And so many excellent authors, stripped  out of their cases, were left naked, to be buried or thrown away. . . .  What soul can be so frozen as not to melt into anger thereat? What  heart, having the least spark of ingenuity, is not hot at this indignity  offered to literature? I deny not but that in this heap of books there  was much rubbish; legions of lying legends, good for nothing but fuel  . . . volumes full fraught with superstition, which, notwithstanding,  might be useful to learned men; except any will deny apothecaries the  privilege of keeping poison in their shops, when they can make antidotes  of them. But, beside these, what beautiful Bibles, rare Fathers, subtile  Schoolmen, useful Historians--ancient, middle, modern; what painful  Comments were here amongst them! What monuments of mathematics all  massacred together; seeing every book with a cross was condemned for  Popish; with circles for conjuring.'    The calamities bewailed in such picturesque language by Bale and Fuller  would have been much more serious but for the labours of one of our  earliest antiquaries and book-lovers, John Leland. 'The laboryouse  Journey and serche of Johan Leylande for Englandes Antiquities geven of  hym as a newe yeares gyfte to kynge Henry the viii in the xxxvij yeare  of his Reygne,' 1549, is a remarkable publication, of great interest to  the book-hunter and the antiquary.    But the fruits of Leland's researches cannot now be fully known, for he  was too intent on accumulating material to draw up an adequate  inventory. Much that he preserved from destruction is now in the British  Museum, and some is in the Bodleian at Oxford. Some of the fragments  which he had saved from the general destruction had been placed in the  King's own library in Westminster.    The dissolution of the monasteries had among its many effects the  creation, so to speak, of a large number of collectors. One of the most  famous of the early sixteenth-century collectors, Sir Thomas More,  however, died (in 1535) before he could have availed himself of the many  treasures scattered to all quarters of the earth.    Dibdin records a bibliomaniacal anecdote which is well worth repeating  here, as it shows how More's love of books had infected even those who  came to seize upon him to carry him to the Tower, and to endeavour to  inveigle him into treasonable expressions: 'While Sir Richard Southwell  and Mr. Palmer weare bussie in trussinge upp his bookes, Mr. Riche,  pretending,' etc., 'whereupon Mr. Palmer, on his deposition, said, that  he was soe bussie ab{t} the trussinge upp Sir Tho. Moore's bookes in a  sacke, that he tooke no heed of there talke.'    Henry, Earl of Arundel, was not slow to seize upon the advantages which  the dissolution placed before everyone. At Nonsuch, in Surrey, he formed  a library, which is described in a biography of him, written shortly  after his death, as 'righte worthye of remembrance.'"]]]
