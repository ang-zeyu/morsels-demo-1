On fire!\" gasped Andy, so plainly astonished  that Tom knew his surprise was genuine.    \"Yes, your keys.  You were a little too quick for me or I'd have  caught you at it.  The next time you pick a lock don't leave your keys  behind you,\" and he held out the jingling ring.    Andy Foger advanced slowly.  He took the bunch of keys and looked at  the tag.    \"They are mine,\" he said slowly, as if there was some doubt about it.    \"Of course they are,\" declared Tom.  \"I found them where you dropped  them--in my boat.\"    \"Do you mean over at the auction?\"    \"No, I mean down in my boathouse, where you sneaked in the other night  and tried to do some damage.    \"The other night!\" cried Andy.  \"I never was near your boathouse any  night and I never lost my keys there!  I lost these the day of the  auction, on Mr. Hastings' ground, and I've been looking for them ever  since.\"    \"Didn't you sneak in my boathouse the other night and try to do some  mischief?  Didn't you drop them then?\"    \"No, I didn't,\" retorted Andy earnestly.  \"I lost those keys at the  auction, and I can prove it to you.  Look, I advertised for them in the  weekly Gazette.\"    The red-haired lad pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket and showed  Tom an advertisement offering a reward of two dollars for a bunch of  keys on a ring, supposed to have been lost at the auction on Mr.  Hastings' grounds in Lanton.  The finder was to return them to Andy  Foger.    \"Does that look as if I lost the keys in your boathouse?\" demanded the  bully sneeringly.  \"I wouldn't have advertised them that way if I'd been  trying to keep my visit quiet.  Besides, I can prove that I was out of  town several nights.  I was over to an entertainment in Mansburg one  night and I didn't get home until two o'clock in the morning, because  my machine broke down.  Ask Ned Newton.  He saw me at the  entertainment.\"    Andy's manner was so earnest that Tom could not help believing him.  Then there was the evidence of the advertisement.  Clearly the  squint-eyed youth had not been the mysterious visitor to the boathouse  and had not unlocked the forward compartment.  But if it was not he,  who could it have been and how did the keys get there?  These were  questions which racked Tom's brain.    \"You can ask Ned Newton,\" repeated Andy.  \"He'll prove that I couldn't  have been near your place, if you don't believe me.\"    \"Oh, I believe you all right,\" answered Tom, for there could be no  doubting Andy's manner, even though he and the young inventor were not  on good terms.  \"But how did your keys get in my boat?\"    \"I don't know, unless you found them, kept them and dropped them  there,\" was the insolent answer.    \"You know better than that,\" exclaimed Tom.    \"Well, I owe you a reward of two dollars for giving them back to me,\"  continued the bully patronizingly.  \"Here it is,\" and he hauled out  some bills.    \"I don't want your money!\" fired back Tom.    \"But I'd like to know who it was that was in my boat.\"    \"And I'd like to know who it was took my keys,\" and Andy stuffed the  money back in his pocket.  Tom did not answer.  He was puzzling over a  queer matter and he wanted to be alone and think.  He turned aside from  the red-haired lad and walked toward his motor-boat.    \"I'll give you a surprise in a few days,\" Andy called after him, but  Tom did not turn his head nor did he inquire what the surprise might be.    Mr. Swift was somewhat puzzled when his son related the outcome of the  key incident.  He agreed with Tom that some one might have found the  ring and kept it, and that the same person might have been the one whom  Tom had surprised in the boathouse.    \"But it's idle to speculate on it,\" commented the inventor.  \"Andy  might have induced some of his chums to act for him in harming your  boat, and the key advertisement might have been only a ruse.\"    \"I hardly think so,\" answered his son, shaking his head.  \"It strikes  me as being very curious, and I'm going to see if I can't get at the  bottom of it.\"    But a week or more passed and Tom had no clew.  In the meanwhile he was  working away at his motor-boat, installing several improvements.    One of these was a better pump, which circulated the water around the  cylinders, and another was a new system of lubrication under forced  feed.    \"This ought to give me a little more speed,\" reasoned Tom, who was not  yet satisfied with his craft.  \"Guess I'll take it out for a spin.\"    He was alone in the ARROW, taking a long course up the lake when, as he  passed a wooded point that concealed from view a sort of bay, he heard  the puffing of another motor-boat.    \"Maybe that's Mr. Hastings,\" thought Tom.  \"If I raced with him now, I  think the ARROW could give a better account of herself.\"    The young inventor looked at the boat as it came into view.  It needed  but a glance to show that it was not the CARLOPA.  Then, as it came  nearer, Tom saw a familiar figure in it--a red-haired, squint-eyed chap.    \"Andy Foger!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"He's got a motor-boat!  This is the  surprise he spoke of.\"    The boat was rapidly approaching him, and he saw that it was painted a  vivid red.  Then he could make out the name on the bow, RED STREAK.  Andy was sending the craft toward him at a fast rate.    \"You needn't think you're the only one on this lake who has a gasoline  boat!\" called Andy boastfully.  \"This is my new one and the fastest  thing afloat around here.  I can go all around you.  Do you want to  race?\"    It was a \"dare,\" and Tom never took such things when he could  reasonably enter a contest.  He swung his boat around so as to shoot  alongside of Andy and answered:    \"Yes, I'll race you.  Where to?\"    \"Down opposite Kolb's dock and back to this point,\" was the answer.  \"I'll give you a start, as my engine has three cylinders.  This is a  racing boat.\"    \"I don't need any start,\" declared Tom.  \"I'll race you on even terms.  Go ahead!\"    Both lads adjusted their timers to get more speed.  The water began to  curl away from the sharp prows, the motors exploded faster and faster.  The race was on between the ARROW and the RED STREAK.          CHAPTER VIII    OFF ON A TRIP      Glancing with critical eyes at the craft of his rival, Tom saw that  Andy Foger had a very fine boat.  The young inventor also realized that  if he was to come anywhere near winning the race he would have to get  the utmost speed out of his engine, for the new boat the bully had was  designed primarily for racing, while Tom's was an all-around pleasure  craft, though capable of something in the speed line.    \"I'll be giving you a tow in a few minutes, as soon as my engine gets  warmed up!\" sneered Andy.    \"Maybe,\" said Tom, and then he crouched down to make as little  resistance as possible to the wind.  Andy, on the contrary, sat boldly  upright at the auto steering wheel of his boat.    On rushed the two motor craft, their prows exactly even and the  propellers tossing up a bulge in the water at their sterns.  Rapidly  acquiring speed after the two lads had adjusted the timers on their  motors, the boats were racing side by side, seemingly on even terms.    The RED STREAK had a very sharp prow, designed to cut through the  water. It was of the type known as an automobile launch.  That is, the  engine was located forward, under a sort of hood, which had two hinged  covers like a bat's wings. The steering-wheel shaft went through the  forward bulkhead, slantingly, like the wheel of an auto, and was  arranged with gasoline and sparking levers on the center post in a  similar manner. At the right of the wheel was a reversing lever, by  which the propeller blades could be set at neutral, or arranged so as  to drive the boat backward. Altogether the RED STREAK was a very fine  boat and had cost considerably more than had Tom's, even when the  latter was new. All these things the young owner of the ARROW thought  of as he steered his craft over the course.    \"I hardly think I can win,\" Tom remarked to himself in a whisper.  \"His  boat is too speedy for this one.  I have a chance, though, for his  engine is new, and I don't believe he understands it as well as I do  mine.  Then, too, I am sure I have a better ignition system.\"    But if Tom had any immediate hopes of defeating Andy, they were doomed  to disappointment, for about two minutes after the race started the RED  STREAK forged slowly ahead.    \"Come on!\" cried the red-haired lad.  \"I thought you wanted a race.\"    \"I do,\" answered the young inventor.  \"We're a long way from the dock  yet, and we've got to come back.\"    \"You'll be out of it by the time I get to the dock,\" declared Andy.    Indeed it began to look so, for the auto boat was now a full length  ahead of Tom's craft and there was open water between them.  But our  hero knew a thing or two about racing, though he had not long been a  motor-boat owner.  He adjusted the automatic oiler on the cylinders to  give more lubrication, as he intended to get more speed out of his  engine.  Then he opened the gasoline cock a trifle more and set his  timer forward a few notches to get an earlier spark.  He was not going  to use the maximum speed just yet, but he first wanted to see how the  motor of the ARROW would behave under these conditions.  To his delight  he saw his boat slowly creeping up on Andy's.  The latter, with a  glance over his shoulder, saw it too, and he advanced his spark.  His  craft forged ahead, but the rate of increase was not equal to Tom's.  \"If I can keep up to him I suppose I ought to be glad,\" thought the  young inventor, \"for his boat is away ahead of mine in rating.\"    Through the water the sharp bows cut.  There were only a few witnesses  to the race, but those who were out in boats saw a pretty sight as the  two speedy craft came on toward the dock, which was the turning point.
