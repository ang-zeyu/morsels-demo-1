Livid with rage, Tom rushed at  him; but Charlie eluded him, and left him to overbalance himself and  fall sprawling on the paved floor.  At this instant the doctor's door  opened, and the head master stood gazing on the scene.    Poor Charlie! five minutes ago so full of bright hopes and brave  resolutions, and now, under the eyes of the very man who had inspired in  him those hopes and resolutions, engaged in a common fight with a  schoolfellow!    \"What is all this?\" asked the doctor sternly.  \"Come in here, you two.\"    Charlie, with sinking heart, entered again that solemn room, and Drift  followed, sulky, and with a black bruise on his forehead.    Charlie left his antagonist to tell his story after his own fashion, and  was too dispirited either to contradict him or seek to justify himself.  He felt ashamed of himself, and in his self-humiliation saw neither  defence nor extenuation for his conduct.    Drift was dismissed with a few sharp words of reproof and warning.  Charlie remained longer.    What the doctor said to him, and what he said to the doctor, I need not  here repeat.  Suffice it to say, the former was able to form a fairer  estimate of my master's conduct than he himself was.  He did not blame  him; he even told him that no boy could expect to get through his school  days without some blows, and advised him to see they were always on the  right side.  He talked to him long and seriously about home, and so  comforted him in prospect of future difficulties and temptations, that  when he left that study the second time, it was as a wiser, though  perhaps a sadder boy than before.        CHAPTER SIX.    HOW MY MASTER HAD BOTH HIS FRIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES AT RANDLEBURY.    The events of Charlie's first day at Randlebury had at least taught him  one salutary lesson, and that was, to moderate his enthusiasm with  regard to me, and consequently for the next few weeks I had a quiet time  of it.  True enough, my master would occasionally produce me in  confidence to a select and admiring audience, and would ever and again  proffer the use of me to his protector, Joe Halliday, but he gave up  flourishing me in the face of every passer-by, and took to buttoning his  jacket over the chain, I found my health all the better for this gentler  usage, and showed my gratitude by keeping perfect time from one week's  end to the other.    It is hardly necessary for me to say that Charlie was not long in making  friends at Randlebury.  Indeed some of his acquaintance looked upon this  exceeding friendliness in the boy's disposition as one of his weak  points.    \"I do believe,\" said Walcot, who was only four from the head of the  school, to his friend, Joe Halliday, one day, about a month after my  master's arrival at Randlebury--\"I do believe that young fag of yours  would chum up to the poker and tongs if there were no fellows here.\"    \"Shouldn't wonder,\" said Joe.  \"He's a sociable young beggar, and keeps  my den uncommon tidy.  Why, only the other day, when I was in no end of  a vicious temper about being rowed about my Greek accents, you know, and  when I should have been really grateful to the young scamp if he'd given  me an excuse for kicking him, what should he do but lay wait for me in  my den with a letter from his father, which he insisted on reading aloud  to me.  What do you think it was about?\"    \"I couldn't guess,\" said Walcot.    \"Well, you must know he's lately chummed up very thick with my young  brother Jim in the second, and--would you believe it?--he took it into  his head to sit down and write to his governor to ask him if he would  give Jim and me each a watch like the one he's got himself.  What do you  think of that?\"    \"Did he, though?\" exclaimed Walcot, laughing.  \"I say, old boy, you'll  make your fortune out of that youngster; and what did his father say?\"    \"Oh, he was most polite, of course; his boy's friends were his friends,  and all that, and he finished up by saying he hoped we should both come  and spend Christmas there.\"    \"Ha! ha! and did he send the watches?\"    \"No; I suppose he wants to spy out the land first.\"    \"Well,\" said Walcot, \"the boy's all right with you, but he'll go making  a fool of himself some day if he makes up to everybody he meets.\"    My master, in fact, was already a popular boy with his fellows.  He had  a select band of admirers among the youth of the Second-Form, who  cackled round him like hens round a bantam.  Together they groaned over  their Latin exercises and wrestled with their decimals; together they  heard the dreaded summons to the master's desk; and side by side, I am  sorry to say, they held out their open palms to receive his cane.  If a  slate bearing on its surface an outline effigy of the gentleman who  presided over the lessons of the class was brought to light, and the  names of its perpetrators demanded, Charlie's hand would be seen among a  forest of other upraised, ink-stained hands, and he would confess with  contrition to having contributed the left eye of the unlucky portrait.  And if, amid the solemn silence which attended a moral discourse from  the master on the evils of gluttony, a sudden cataract of nuts, apples,  turnips, and jam sandwiches on to the floor should drown the good man's  voice, Charlie would be one of the ill-starred wights who owned to a  partnership in the bag of good things which had thus miserably burst,  and would proceed with shame first to crawl and grope on the dusty floor  to collect his contraband possessions, and then solemnly to deposit the  same jam, turnips, and all, on the desk of the offended dominie as a  confiscated forfeit.    By these and many other like experiences Charlie identified himself with  his comrades, and established many and memorable bonds of sympathy.  He  took the allegiance of his followers and the penalties of his masters in  equal good part.  He was not the boy to glory in his scrapes, but he was  the boy to get into them, and once in, no fear of punishment could make  a tell-tale, a cheat, or a coward of him.    With the elder boys he was also a favourite, for what big boy does not  take pride in patronising a plucky, frank youngster?  Patronising with  Charlie did not mean humiliation.  It is true he would quake at times in  the majestic company of the heroes of the Sixth Form, but without  hanging his head or toadying.  It is one thing to reverence a fellow-  being, and another to kneel and lick his boots.    Altogether Charlie had what is called \"fallen on his feet\" at  Randlebury.  By the end of two months he was as much at home there as if  he had strutted its halls for two years.  His whistle was as shrill as  any in the lobbies, and Mrs Packer stuck her fingers in her ears when  he burst into her parlour to demand a clean collar.  He had already  signalised himself too on the cricket field, having scored one run (by a  leg-bye) in the never-to-be-forgotten match of First Form, First Eleven,  against Second-Form, Second Eleven; and he had annihilated the  redoubtable Alfred Redhead in the hundred yards hopping match,  accomplishing that distance in the wonderfully short time of forty-five  seconds!    But the dearest of all his friends was Jim Halliday, his lord and  master's young brother.  To Jim, Charlie opened his own soul, and me,  and the knife; with Jim he laid his schemes for the future, and  arranged, when he was Governor-General of India and Jim was Prime  Minister, he would swop a couple of elephants for one of Ash and  Tackle's best twenty-foot fishing-rods, with a book of flies complete.  With Jim, Charlie talked about home and his father, and the coming  holidays, till his face shone with the brightness of the prospect.  Nor  was the faithful Jim less communicative.  He told Charlie all about his  sisters down at Dullfield, where his father had once been clergyman, and  gave it as his opinion that Jenny was the one Charlie had better marry;  and to Charlie he imparted, as an awful secret not to be so much as  whispered to any one, that he (Jim) was going to array his imposing  figure for the first time in a tail-coat at Christmas.    With two friends on such a footing of confidence, is it a wonder they  clave one to the other in mute admiration and affection?  Many a  sumptuous supper, provided at the imminent peril of embargo by the  authorities on the one hand, and capture by hungry pirates on the other,  did they smuggle into port and enjoy in company; on many a half-holiday  did they fish for hours in the same pool, or climb the same tree for the  same nest; what book of Jim's was there (schoolbooks excepted) that  Charlie had not dog's-eared; and was not Charlie's little library  annotated in every page by Jim's elegant thumbs?  In short, these two  were as one.  David and Jonathan were nothing to them.    But in the midst of all his comfort and happiness one continually  recurring thought troubled Charlie, that was about Tom Drift.  He had  promised the mother to be a friend to her son, and although he owned to  himself he neither liked nor admired Tom, he could not be easy with this  broken promise on his mind.    One day, about a month after the quarrel outside the head master's  study, my master, after a hard inward struggle, conceived the desperate  resolve of going himself to the lion in his den and seeking a  reconciliation.    He walked quickly to Tom's study, for fear his resolution might fail  him, and knocked as boldly as he could at the door.    \"Come in!\" cried Tom inside.    Charlie entered, and found his late antagonist sprawling on two chairs,  reading a yellow-backed novel.    At the sight of Charlie he scowled, and looked anything but  conciliatory.    \"What do you want?\" he said angrily.    \"Oh, Tom Drift!\" cried Charlie, plunging at once into his subject, \"I do  wish you'd be friends; I am so sorry I hurt you.\"    This last was an ill-judged reference; Tom was vicious enough about that  bruise on his forehead "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#8)"],[1," you hear me calling?\" he said.  \"You know it's against rules to  go out of bounds, and I thought--\"    \"What! who's been out of bounds?\" said the voice of the Henniker at that  moment.    Hawkesbury looked dejected.    \"Who did you say, Hawkesbury, had been out of bounds?\"    \"I'd rather not tell tales,\" said Hawkesbury, sweetly.    \"I've been out of bounds,\" blurted out Smith, \"and so has Batchelor.  I  asked him to come, and Hawkesbury has been spying and--\"    \"Silence,\" cried Miss Henniker.  \"Smith and Batchelor, follow me.\"    We followed duly to Mr Ladislaw's study, where we were arraigned.  Hawkesbury was sent for as evidence.  He came smiling, and declared he  may have been mistaken, perhaps it was two other boys; he hoped we  should not be punished, etcetera.  Smith was nearly breaking out once or  twice during this, and it was all I could do to keep him in.  Hawkesbury  was thanked and dismissed, and then, with the assistance of Miss  Henniker, Mr Hashford, and Mr Ladislaw, Smith and I were birched, and  forbidden the playground for a fortnight, during which period we were  required to observe absolute silence.    So ended our little adventure out for a puff of free air!  Among our  fellows we gained little enough sympathy for our misfortunes.  Flanagan  was the only fellow who seemed really sorry.  The rest of the ill-  conditioned lot saw in the affair only a good opportunity of crowing  over their ill-starred adversary, and telling me it served me right for  chumming up to such a one.    One day, greatly to my surprise, when the Henniker was away  superintending the flogging of Flanagan for some offence or other,  Hawkesbury came over and sat beside me.    \"Oh,\" said he, softly, \"Batchelor, I've been wanting to tell you how  sorry I am I helped get you into your scrape.  I didn't mean--I was only  anxious for you to know the rule.  I hope you'll forgive me?\" and he  held out his hand.    What could I do?  Perhaps he was telling the truth after all, and we had  thought too badly of him.  And when a big boy comes and asks pardon of a  small one, it is always embarrassing for the latter.  So I gave him my  hand, and told him I was sure he did not mean it, and that it did not  matter at all.    \"Thanks, Batchelor,\" he said, smiling quite gratefully.  \"It's a relief  to me.\"    Then I watched him go on what I knew was a similar errand to Smith, but,  as I expected, his reception in that quarter was not quite so flattering  as it had been in my case.  I could see my chum's eyes fire up as he saw  the elder boy approach, and a flush come over his pale cheeks.  I  watched Hawkesbury blandly repeating his apology, and then suddenly, to  my astonishment and consternation, I saw Smith rise in his seat and  throw himself furiously upon his enemy.  Hawkesbury was standing near a  low form, and in the sudden surprise caused by this attack he tripped  over it and fell prone on the floor, just as Miss Henniker re-entered.    There was a brief pause of universal astonishment, then the Henniker  demanded, \"What is this?  Tell me.  What is all this, Hawkesbury?\"    Hawkesbury had risen to his feet, smiling as ever, and brushing the dust  from his coat, replied softly, \"Nothing, really nothing, ma'am.  I fell  down, that's all.\"    \"I knocked you down!\" shouted Smith, panting like a steam-engine, and  trembling with excitement.    \"Oh,\" said Hawkesbury, kindly, though not quite liking the downright way  in which the adventure had been summed up.  \"It was only play, Miss  Henniker.  My fault as much as Smith's.  He never meant to be so rough.  Really.\"    \"Silence, both!\" said Miss Henniker.  \"Smith, follow me!\"    \"Oh, Miss Henniker, please don't punish him,\" said Hawkesbury.    \"Silence,\" replied the Henniker, icily.  \"Come, Smith.\"    Miss Henniker had the wonderful art of knowing by instinct who was the  culprit in cases like this.  She was never troubled with a doubt as to  her verdict being a right one; and really it saved her a great deal of  trouble.    Smith was haled away to justice, where, in addition to a flogging and  further term of imprisonment, he was reduced for a given period to a  bread-and-water diet, and required publicly to beg Hawkesbury's pardon.    That there might be no delay about the execution of the last part of the  sentence, the culprit was conducted back forthwith to the schoolroom,  accompanied by Miss Henniker and Mr Ladislaw.    \"Hawkesbury,\" said the latter, addressing the injured boy, \"I have  desired Smith to beg your pardon here and now for his conduct to you.  Smith, do as you have been told.\"    Smith remained silent, and I who watched him could see that his mind was  made up.    \"Do you hear Mr Ladislaw, Smith?\" demanded the Henniker; \"do as you are  bid, at once.\"    \"Please, sir,\" began Hawkesbury, with his pleasant smile.    \"Silence, Hawkesbury,\" said the Henniker.  \"Now, Smith.\"    But she might have been addressing a log of wood.    \"Do you hear what I say to you?\" once more she exclaimed.    Smith only glared at her with his big eyes, and resolutely held his  tongue.    \"Then,\" said Mr Ladislaw, \"Smith must be publicly punished.\"    Smith was punished publicly; and a more repulsive spectacle I never wish  to witness.  A public punishment at Stonebridge House meant a flogging  administered to one helpless boy by the whole body of his schoolfellows,  two of whom firmly held the victim, while each of the others in turn  flogged him.  In the case of an unpopular boy like Smith, this  punishment was specially severe, and I turned actually sick as each of  the cowardly louts stepped up and vented their baffled wrath upon him.  Hawkesbury, of course, only made the slightest pretence of touching him;  but this of all his punishment seemed to be the part Smith could bear  least.  At last, when it was all over, the bruised boy slunk back to his  desk, and class proceeded.    That night, as I knelt beside my poor chum's bed, he said, \"We've paid  pretty dear for our run on the heath, Fred.\"    \"_You_ have, old man,\" I replied.    Smith lay still for some time musing, then he said, \"Whatever do they  mean by forgiving enemies, Fred?\"    Smith didn't often get on these topics, and I was a little nervous as I  replied, \"What it says, I suppose.\"    \"Does it mean fellows like Hawkesbury?\"    \"I should say so,\" said I, almost doubtful, from the way in which he  spoke, whether after all I might not be mistaken.    \"Queer,\" was all he replied, musingly.    I tried hard to change the subject.    \"Are you awfully sore, Jack?\"  I said.  \"Have one of my pillows.\"    \"Oh no, thanks.  But I say, Fred, don't you think it's queer?\"    \"What, about forgiving your enemies?  Well, yes it is, rather.  But, I  say, it's time I cut back.  Good-night, old man.\"    And I crept back to bed, and lay awake half the night listening to him  as he turned from side to side in his sleep, and feeling that everything  and everybody was queer, especially my friend Smith.        CHAPTER FIVE.    HOW A    CHAPTER OF MISFORTUNES BEFEL MY FRIEND SMITH AND ME.    The summer wore on, and with it the gloom of Stonebridge House sunk  deeper and deeper into our spirits.  After a week or two even the sense  of novelty wore off, and we settled down to our drudges' doom as if we  were destined all our lives never to see any place outside the  Henniker's domain.    If it hadn't been for Smith I don't know how I should have endured it.  Not that we ever had much chance of enjoying one another's society.  In  school it was wholly impossible.  In the playground (particularly after  our recent escapade), we had very little opportunity given us; and at  night, when secretly we did contrive to talk, it was with the constant  dread of detection hanging over us.    What concerned me most of all, though, was the bad way in which Smith  seemed to get on with every one of his schoolfellows except me, and--  perhaps Flanagan.  With the bullies, like Philpot and Rathbone, he was  at daggers drawn; towards the others he never took the trouble to  conceal his dislike, while with Hawkesbury an explosion seemed always,  imminent.    I could not understand why he got on so badly, especially with  Hawkesbury, who certainly never made himself disagreeable, but, on the  contrary, always appeared desirous to be friendly.  I sometimes thought  Smith was unreasonable to foster his instinctive dislike as he did.    \"Jack,\" said I one night as he was \"paying a call\" to my bedside--\"Jack,  I'm half beginning to think Hawkesbury isn't so bad a fellow after all.\"    \"Why?\" demanded Smith.    \"Oh, I don't know.  He's done me one or two good turns lately.\"    \"What sort?\"    \"Well, he helped me in the Latin the other day, of his own accord,  and--\"    \"Go on,\" said Smith, impatiently.    \"And he gave me a knife to-day.  You know I lost mine, and he said he'd  got two.\"    Smith grunted.    \"I'd like to catch him doing a good turn to me, that's all,\" said he.  \"_I'd_ cure him of that!\"    I didn't like to hear Smith talk like this.  For one thing, it sounded  as if he must be a great deal less foolish than I was, which nobody  likes to admit; and for another thing, it seemed wrong and unreasonable,  unless for a very good cause, to persist in believing nothing good about  anybody else.    So I changed the subject.    \"I say,\" said I, \"what are you going to do these holidays?\"    \"Stay here,\" said he.  \"Are you going home?\"    \"What!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Stay here for four weeks with the old Hen?  Why  ever, Jack?\"    \"Don't know--but that's what I've got to do.  Are you going home?\"    \"I suppose so,\" said I, with an inward groan.  \"But, Jack, what _will_  you do with yourself?\"    \"Much as usual, I expect.  Sha'n't get much practice in talking till you  come back!\" added he, with a low laugh.    \"Jack, why don't you go home?\"  I exclaimed.  \"Are you in a row there,  or what?  You never tell me a word about it.\"    \"Look-out, I hear some one moving!\" cried"]]]
