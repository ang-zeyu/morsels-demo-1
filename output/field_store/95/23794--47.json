Kindly  convey to these friends the expression of his warmest good wishes for the  extension and success of their labours in service to our beloved Faith,  and do urge them whole-heartedly, joyously and confidently persevere in  their task of promulgating the message in Hobart.    With regard to Mrs. Routh's request for permission to visit Haifa; much as  the Guardian desires her to undertake such longed for visit to the Holy  Shrines, he feels that owing to the continued disturbances agitating the  Holy Land, and which give no sign of abating, it would be inadvisable for  her to come at such a dangerous time. He hopes some day when the situation  will have returned to normal in Palestine, she will have an opportunity of  undertaking this pilgrimage.    Assuring you, and your newly-elected fellow-members in the N.S.A. of his  continued prayers and best wishes, and with affectionate greetings to all  the friends,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The recent evidences of your marvellous activities in the service of our  beloved Faith have brought infinite joy to my heart. The institutions you  are so devotedly and laboriously erecting, multiplying and perfecting,  notwithstanding your limited numbers, the scarcity of Baha'i teachers and  proper facilities, and despite your limited resources and the varied  obstacles in your way, attest the splendid progress you have achieved and  augur well for the future of your historic work in His service. The  summer-school is but one of those institutions which you have established  with such a rare spirit of devotion, such magnificent loyalty and such  assiduous care. The foundation you have laid is broad, solid and  unassailable. The rising generation who will build upon it will extol your  virtues, ennoble your task, preserve the record of your acts, and transmit  to posterity the great tradition which you are now so happily and nobly  establishing. My heart brims over with gratitude for all that you are  achieving, and is filled with hopes for all that you will achieve in the  near and distant future. Perseverance, fidelity, redoubled effort, will  enable you to reap a rich harvest and to attain your shining goal.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF NOVEMBER 4TH, 1940      November 4th, 1940    Dear Miss Brooks,    Your communications dated April 22nd and August 23rd written on behalf of  the N.S.A. of Australia and New-Zealand with the enclosed reports have all  been safely received, and their contents noted with feelings of deepest  satisfaction and gratitude by our beloved Guardian.    Also he has received the copy of the Mittagong Star, the reproduction of  registration certificate, the three snaps and the three photographs which  you had mailed under separate cover, for all of which he wishes you to  heartily thank the N.S.A. on his behalf.    He wishes you, in particular, to convey his warmest greetings and  congratulations to the members of the newly-elected N.S.A., whose names he  has been very pleased to note, and to assure them of his prayers for their  guidance and confirmation in the discharge of their heavy and sacred  duties and responsibilites throughout this year. Despite the sorrow and  distress created by the war, and the heavy sacrifices it is increasingly  imposing upon the community of the faithful throughout Australia and  New-Zealand, he confidently hopes that your Assembly, with the help and  support of all the believers in that land, will continue prosecuting, with  the same devoted zeal, resourcefulness and determination as before, its  twofold task of extending the scope of the teaching work, and of further  consolidating the foundations of the Administration. The unity and  efficiency with which it has been functioning in the past year, as  attested by the rich record of its accomplishments, indeed augur well for  the future of its activities, and it is the Guardian's fervent hope that,  notwithstanding the delay and dislocation which the prosecution of the war  has inevitably occasioned, it will continue to advance and prosper, and  receive unforseen opportunities of spreading and of strengthening the  foundations of the Cause throughout that far-off Continent.    In this time of world calamity his thoughts and prayers are often with our  dearly-beloved friends in Australia and New Zealand, and he is ardently  supplicating Baha'u'llah, on their behalf, that He may bestow upon them  such measure of His guidance, protection and strength as would enable them  to courageously and successfully meet the tests and trials of the days  ahead.    Assuring you, in closing, of his special prayers on your own behalf, and  reciprocating your greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear co-worker:    The report of your activities and of those of your fellow-workers,  undertaken at such a time, and despite such difficulties and with such a  courage, devotion, determination, thoroughness and fidelity, deserves  indeed the highest praise and constitutes a powerful evidence of the  unconquerable Spirit and the ever-extending range, and the ever-deepening  influence of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. Your work is surely blessed by Him,  and your fellow-labourers in distant lands derive great encouragement and  inspiration from the incessant and remarkable efforts you are so devotedly  exerting. Persevere and rest assured that I will, with increasing fervour,  pray on your behalf at the Holy Shrines,    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JANUARY 3RD, 1941      January 3rd, 1941    Dear Miss Brooks,    At the Guardian's direction I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your  communication of December 17th just arrived, together with the copy of the  resolutions passed by the N.S.A. of Australia and New-Zealand in its  August meeting, as well as the copy of the statement on the \"Baha'i  Attitude to War\" recently issued by your Assembly. He found that statement  most satisfactory both in its form and in its clear and comprehensive  presentation of the underlying principles governing the collective  attitude of the believers in this vital issue of the hour.    The friends should indeed make a careful study of this statement, so as to  be able to intelligently and correctly answer any questions put to them  either by the authorities or individual inquirers.    The Guardian has been particularly pleased to note that the response of  the Prime Minister, and of the premier of Victoria and other ministers to  whom you had submitted a copy of the above statement has been so cordial,  and he feels relieved to know that through this action of your Assembly  any doubts or misapprehensions regading the attitude of the Baha'is to war  have been dispelled, and that the authorities feel, as a result, much more  favourable towards the Cause, now that they know for themselves that it is  entirely non-political in character and that it enjoins absolute loyalty  and obedience to the Government.    This opportunity your Assembly has had of establishing direct contact with  the authorities is indeed a step of vital significance to the Cause in  Australia and New-Zealand, and is bound to pave the way for its ultimate  recognition as an independent religious Faith, entitled to the same rights  and privileges which other religious bodies and institutions enjoy in that  land.    The Guardian wishes me in closing to express his deepfelt appreciation of  your teaching services in Melbourne and Hobart, in which cities you seem  to have accomplished such splendid work, both in introducing the Cause to  the general public and by assisting the friends in better conducting their  teaching and administrative activities.    May the Beloved ever bless and guide your efforts, and may He also  strengthen and confirm your fellow-members in the N.S.A. in the discharge  of their arduous duties and responsibilities. To you and to them all he  sends his warmest greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear co-workers:    The manner and spirit in which the dearly-beloved friends in Australia and  New Zealand are discharging their multifarious and sacred  responsibilities, in these days of strife and peril, augur well for the  future of their mission in that far-off continent. The sound lines along  which the administration of the Faith is evolving, the courage and  fidelity with which they defend the integrity and assert the claims, and  proclaim the verities of their beloved Cause are evidences of their onward  march and the potentialities with which they are endowed. I rejoice and am  thankful. I will continue to pray and seek for them still greater  blessings.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF APRIL 19TH, 1941      Haifa, April 19th, 1941    Dear Baha'i friends:    Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter of March 16th,  1941.    He was very pleased to learn that Mother Dunn has accepted in such a noble  and exemplary Baha'i spirit the loss of dear Father Dunn, and that the  friends of Sydney are preparing a full description of his death and the  funeral. The Guardian would like very much to receive all such histories  and reports for the next Vol. of \"Baha'i World\". He would also like you to  send him three good photographs of Father Dunn and some of his grave and  tombstone--whenever the latter are available.    The truly remarkable services of Hyde Dunn will never be forgotten. They  have added a golden page to the history of the Formative Period of our  Faith. The whole-hearted response to 'Abdu'l-B"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#8)"],[1,"Dayyan's father, an intimate  friend of that minister, had already expressed to him his grave  apprehension at the manner in which the able functionaries of the state  were being won over to the new Faith. To allay the rising excitement the  Bab was summoned to Tabriz. Fearful of the enthusiasm of the people of  A_dh_irbayjan, those into whose custody He had been delivered decided to  deflect their route, and avoid the town of _Kh_uy, passing instead through  Urumiyyih. On His arrival in that town Prince Malik Qasim Mirza  ceremoniously received Him, and was even seen, on a certain Friday, when  his Guest was riding on His way to the public bath, to accompany Him on  foot, while the Prince's footmen endeavored to restrain the people who, in  their overflowing enthusiasm, were pressing to catch a glimpse of so  marvelous a Prisoner. Tabriz, in its turn in the throes of wild  excitement, joyously hailed His arrival. Such was the fervor of popular  feeling that the Bab was assigned a place outside the gates of the city.  This, however, failed to allay the prevailing emotion. Precautions,  warnings and restrictions served only to aggravate a situation that had  already become critical. It was at this juncture that the Grand Vizir  issued his historic order for the immediate convocation of the  ecclesiastical dignitaries of Tabriz to consider the most effectual  measures which would, once and for all, extinguish the flames of so  devouring a conflagration.    The circumstances attending the examination of the Bab, as a result of so  precipitate an act, may well rank as one of the chief landmarks of His  dramatic career. The avowed purpose of that convocation was to arraign the  Prisoner, and deliberate on the steps to be taken for the extirpation of  His so-called heresy. It instead afforded Him the supreme opportunity of  His mission to assert in public, formally and without any reservation, the  claims inherent in His Revelation. In the official residence, and in the  presence, of the governor of A_dh_irbayjan, Nasiri'd-Din Mirza, the heir  to the throne; under the presidency of Haji Mulla Mahmud, the  Nizamu'l-'Ulama, the Prince's tutor; before the assembled ecclesiastical  dignitaries of Tabriz, the leaders of the _Sh_ay_kh_i community, the  _Sh_ay_kh_u'l-Islam, and the Imam-Jum'ih, the Bab, having seated Himself  in the chief place which had been reserved for the Vali-'Ahd (the heir to  the throne), gave, in ringing tones, His celebrated answer to the question  put to Him by the President of that assembly. \"I am,\" He exclaimed, \"I am,  I am the Promised One! I am the One Whose name you have for a thousand  years invoked, at Whose mention you have risen, Whose advent you have  longed to witness, and the hour of Whose Revelation you have prayed God to  hasten. Verily, I say, it is incumbent upon the peoples of both the East  and the West to obey My word, and to pledge allegiance to My person.\"    Awe-struck, those present momentarily dropped their heads in silent  confusion. Then Mulla Muhammad-i-Mamaqani, that one-eyed white-bearded  renegade, summoning sufficient courage, with characteristic insolence,  reprimanded Him as a perverse and contemptible follower of Satan; to which  the undaunted Youth retorted that He maintained what He had already  asserted. To the query subsequently addressed to Him by the  Nizamu'l-'Ulama the Bab affirmed that His words constituted the most  incontrovertible evidence of His mission, adduced verses from the Qur'an  to establish the truth of His assertion, and claimed to be able to reveal,  within the space of two days and two nights, verses equal to the whole of  that Book. In answer to a criticism calling His attention to an infraction  by Him of the rules of grammar, He cited certain passages from the Qur'an  as corroborative evidence, and, turning aside, with firmness and dignity,  a frivolous and irrelevant remark thrown at Him by one of those who were  present, summarily disbanded that gathering by Himself rising and quitting  the room. The convocation thereupon dispersed, its members confused,  divided among themselves, bitterly resentful and humiliated through their  failure to achieve their purpose. Far from daunting the spirit of their  Captive, far from inducing Him to recant or abandon His mission, that  gathering was productive of no other result than the decision, arrived at  after considerable argument and discussion, to inflict the bastinado on  Him, at the hands, and in the prayer-house of the heartless and avaricious  Mirza 'Ali-As_gh_ar, the _Sh_ay_kh_u'l-Islam of that city. Confounded in  his schemes Haji Mirza Aqasi was forced to order the Bab to be taken back  to _Ch_ihriq.    This dramatic, this unqualified and formal declaration of the Bab's  prophetic mission was not the sole consequence of the foolish act which  condemned the Author of so weighty a Revelation to a three years'  confinement in the mountains of A_dh_irbayjan. This period of captivity,  in a remote corner of the realm, far removed from the storm centers of  _Sh_iraz, Isfahan, and Tihran, afforded Him the necessary leisure to  launch upon His most monumental work, as well as to engage on other  subsidiary compositions designed to unfold the whole range, and impart the  full force, of His short-lived yet momentous Dispensation. Alike in the  magnitude of the writings emanating from His pen, and in the diversity of  the subjects treated in those writings, His Revelation stands wholly  unparalleled in the annals of any previous religion. He Himself affirms,  while confined in Mah-Ku, that up to that time His writings, embracing  highly diversified subjects, had amounted to more than five hundred  thousand verses. \"The verses which have rained from this Cloud of Divine  mercy,\" is Baha'u'llah's testimony in the Kitab-i-Iqan, \"have been so  abundant that none hath yet been able to estimate their number. A score of  volumes are now available. How many still remain beyond our reach! How  many have been plundered and have fallen into the hands of the enemy, the  fate of which none knoweth!\" No less arresting is the variety of themes  presented by these voluminous writings, such as prayers, homilies,  orations, Tablets of visitation, scientific treatises, doctrinal  dissertations, exhortations, commentaries on the Qur'an and on various  traditions, epistles to the highest religious and ecclesiastical  dignitaries of the realm, and laws and ordinances for the consolidation of  His Faith and the direction of its activities.    Already in _Sh_iraz, at the earliest stage of His ministry, He had  revealed what Baha'u'llah has characterized as \"the first, the greatest,  and mightiest of all books\" in the Babi Dispensation, the celebrated  commentary on the surih of Joseph, entitled the Qayyumu'l-Asma, whose  fundamental purpose was to forecast what the true Joseph (Baha'u'llah)  would, in a succeeding Dispensation, endure at the hands of one who was at  once His arch-enemy and blood brother. This work, comprising above nine  thousand three hundred verses, and divided into one hundred and eleven  chapters, each chapter a commentary on one verse of the above-mentioned  surih, opens with the Bab's clarion-call and dire warnings addressed to  the \"concourse of kings and of the sons of kings;\" forecasts the doom of  Muhammad _Sh_ah; commands his Grand Vizir, Haji Mirza Aqasi, to abdicate  his authority; admonishes the entire Muslim ecclesiastical order; cautions  more specifically the members of the _Sh_i'ah community; extols the  virtues, and anticipates the coming, of Baha'u'llah, the \"Remnant of God,\"  the \"Most Great Master;\" and proclaims, in unequivocal language, the  independence and universality of the Babi Revelation, unveils its import,  and affirms the inevitable triumph of its Author. It, moreover, directs  the \"people of the West\" to \"issue forth from your cities and aid the  Cause of God;\" warns the peoples of the earth of the \"terrible, the most  grievous vengeance of God;\" threatens the whole Islamic world with \"the  Most Great Fire\" were they to turn aside from the newly-revealed Law;  foreshadows the Author's martyrdom; eulogizes the high station ordained  for the people of Baha, the \"Companions of the crimson-colored ruby Ark;\"  prophesies the fading out and utter obliteration of some of the greatest  luminaries in the firmament of the Babi Dispensation; and even predicts  \"afflictive torment,\" in both the \"Day of Our Return\" and in \"the world  which is to come,\" for the usurpers of the Imamate, who \"waged war against  Husayn (Imam Husayn) in the Land of the Euphrates.\"    It was this Book which the Babis universally regarded, during almost the  entire ministry of the Bab, as the Qur'an of the people of the Bayan;  whose first and most challenging chapter was revealed in the presence of  Mulla Husayn, on the night of its Author's Declaration; some of whose  pages were borne, by that same disciple, to Baha'u'llah, as the first  fruits of a Revelation which instantly won His enthusiastic allegiance;  whose entire text was translated into Persian by the brilliant and gifted  Tahirih; whose passages inflamed the hostility of Husayn _Kh_an and  precipitated the initial outbreak of persecution in _Sh_iraz; a single  page of which had captured the imagination and entranced the soul of  Hujjat; and whose contents had set afire the intrepid defenders of the  Fort of _Sh_ay_kh_ Tabarsi and the heroes of Nayriz and Zanjan.    This work, of such exalted merit, of such far-reaching influence, was  followed by the revelation of the Bab's first Tablet to Muhammad _Sh_ah;  of His Tablets to Sultan 'Abdu'l-Majid and to Najib Pa_sh_a, the Vali of  Ba_gh_dad; of the Sahifiy-i-baynu'l-Haramayn, revealed between Mecca and  Medina, in answer to questions posed by Mirza Muhit-i-Kirmani; of the  Epistle to the _Sh_erif of Mecca; of the Kitabu'r-Ruh, comprising seven  hundred surihs; of the _Kh_asa'il-i-Sab'ih,"]]]
