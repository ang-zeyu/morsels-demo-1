On our return from Montafilant we stopped to visit the Lunatic Asylum  (Asile des alienes), called Les Bas Foins, kept by the brothers of  Saint-Jean-de-Dieu. There are six hundred inmates under the charge of  about sixty brethren. The buildings, with the chapel, are very handsome  and most complete in all the arrangements. Within the enclosure is a large  piece of land. The lunatics are employed in agricultural, garden, and  house occupations; they look very contented and happy. Visitors are not  allowed to speak to them. We omitted seeing the Croix du Saint Esprit, a  curiously sculptured Gothic granite cross of the fourteenth century, not  far from the asylum.    The castle of Dinan is now a prison. It was occupied by the Queen-Duchess  Anne, when on her way to a pilgrimage to Notre Dame-du-Folgoet, in  fulfilment of a vow made during the illness of Louis XII. In the chapel is  shewn a sculptured seat, still called the arm-chair of the Duchess Anne.  Within these walls were crammed, in the last century, about 2000 English  prisoners of war, many of whom fell victims to a contagious fever. From  the platform of the keep we had a magnificent view of the surrounding  country, extending to Mont Dol and the sea.    The church of St. Sauveur has a richly sculptured Romanesque portal. It  contains the heart of Du Guesclin, transferred from the church of the  Dominicans, where he desired it to be interred by the side of his wife  Tiphaine. His body was buried at St. Denis, in a tomb King Charles V.  caused to be made in his lifetime, and he left orders that on his death  his Constable should repose at his feet. On the dark-coloured monumental  stone now incrusted on the wall, are roughly sculptured his arms (an eagle  displayed charged with a cotice(3)), with a commemorative inscription in  gold letters:--          \"Cy: gist: le cueur: de      Missire: bertram: du gueaqui      en: son vivat: conetiable de      france: qui: trepassa: le: xiii^e      jour: de: jullet: l'an: mil iii^e      IIII^xx dont: son: corps: repos      avecques: ceulx: des: Roys      a sainct: denis en France.\"      Above hangs a painting representing the Governor of Chateauneuf Randon,  laying the keys of the town upon the dead body of the Constable.(4)    [Illustration: 13. Effigy of Jean de Beaumanoir.]    Many of the streets of Dinan preserve the character of the Middle Ages,  the houses upon columns forming a kind of porch or covered way; and most  curious of all is the dirty, steep, narrow, winding street, called the Rue  de Jerzual, a ravine extending from the top of the town, in one pitch, to  the river's edge. The Museum at the Mairie has an interesting collection  of tumulary slabs--recumbent figures taken from different churches and  abbeys, mostly from the Beaumanoir chapel of the Abbey of Lehon. There is  one of Jean de Beaumanoir, son of the hero of the \"Combat des Trente,\"  treacherously slain by his steward. He is represented in full armour, but  with his head bare, to indicate the manner of his death. The effigy of his  wife is also in complete armour, but on the belt that encircles her waist,  like those worn by the knights, is sculptured a wreath of roses. She was a  Du Guesclin by birth, and her feet repose upon an eagle, the bearing of  her house. The statue of Roland, Vicomte de Dinan, one of the nine great  Barons of Brittany in the twelfth century, is of gigantic proportions; the  warrior is clad from head to foot in chain mail, but he holds one of his  gauntlets in his hand. In the Museum is also a clock given to the city of  Dinan by the Duchess Anne, inscribed with the name of its maker and the  date of its construction: \"1498, a Nantes par M. Hainzer de cette ville.\"  The ancient bronze standard measures (etalons) of Dinan are decorated with  the arms of the City, and Gothic inscriptions in relief, \"Cart (quart) a  gros ble pour Dinan\"--\"Cart a fourmant (froment) pour Dinan\"--and \"Bouesceau  a scel (boisseau a sel) pour Dinan.\" Portraits of Du Guesclin and other  Breton worthies are in one of the rooms (Salle de l'Odeon). That of the  Constable answers to the description given of his appearance. He was low  in stature, with large Breton head, broad shoulders, long arms, and large  hands. His eyes were green, and his complexion swarthy: \"la peau noire  comme un sanglier.\"    [Illustration: 14. Chateau of La Belliere.]    The drives round Dinan are endless in variety,(5) and all beautiful. We  took a carriage to see the Chateau of la Belliere, about five miles and a  half from Dinan, formerly the residence of Du Guesclin's wife, the  celebrated Lady Tiphaine; her name answers probably to our English  Tiffany:--          \"William de Coningsby--      Came out of Brittany      With his wife Tiffany      And her maid Manifas      And his doggs Hardigras.\"      [Illustration: 15. Chimney. Chateau of La Belliere.]    The Lady Tiphaine was heiress and daughter of the Vicomte de Belliere; so  deeply versed was she in astrology, she was called Tiphaine la Fee. During  her husband's absence in Spain, she resided at Mont Saint Michel, having  chosen this insulated spot for the facilities it afforded her of studying  the stars. She gave Du Guesclin a calendar on vellum, containing verses at  the beginning of each month, pointing out the lucky and unlucky days; how  many she marked down as such, we know not. Tycho Brahe had thirty-two  fatal days in his calendar. Had Du Guesclin consulted this precious  volume, which is now preserved in the Library at Avranches, he would never  have risked his fortune by fighting the battle of Auray on the Feast of  St. Michel, one of the fatal days against which she specially warns him in  her book. We wished to have seen the room where she died, and where many  memorials of her are preserved; but the proprietor was at his dejeuner,  and would not grant us admittance, so we were forced to be content with  seeing the exterior of the house, a chateau of the end of the fourteenth  century. It stands on the edge of a large sheet of water, in the midst of  trees on the roadside between Dinan and St. Malo. Its principal  characteristics are its tall octagonal chimney-shafts, composed of  granite, brick, and slate.  They are surmounted by pieces of slate placed  edgeways and forming a kind of capital or coronet to the granite shaft.  Some of the chimneys have two circles of these coronets, and others are  enriched with little rows of arches, of which the sombre slate background  throws out the delicate ornamentation. Recrossing the magnificent viaduct,  we proceeded to visit the Benedictine Priory of Lehon, called in the  country \"Chapelle des Beaumanoirs\" from the mortuary chapel of that family  attached to the abbey:--          \"Beaumanoir! a ce nom de glorieux prodiges      Des siecles ecoules reveillent les prestiges:      La pierre des tombeaux a paru se mouvoir      Et des trente Bretons les clameurs belliqueuses      Semblent repondre, sous ces voutes fameuses,      A ce grand nom de Beaumanoir.\" --AUBRY.      The west front, with its round-arched portal surmounted by a large Gothic  window, is very pretty. The chapel of the Beaumanoirs was ravaged at the  Revolution, the lead of the coffins sold, and the bones scattered. The  statues have since been removed to the Museum at Dinan, and the crypt  beneath, where they were buried, is inaccessible. At the Revolution, when  the monks were expelled, the priory was sold and used for a spinning  factory; and the weight of the machines crushed the floors, so as to shut  up the entrance to the vaults. In the parish church adjacent, is to be  noticed an ancient baptismal font, of cylindrical form, sculptured within  and without. We returned home by the Chateau du Chene-Ferron, approached  by an avenue of firs, and had a lovely drive along the banks of the Rance.    Our last excursion in Dinan was to the Chateau of La Garaye, rendered  famous by the virtues and boundless charity of its last proprietors, Count  Claude Toussaint Marot de la Garaye and his wife, whose interesting story  is told in the charming poem of Mrs. Norton:--          \"Listen to the tale I tell,      Grave the story is--not sad,      And the peasant plodding by      Greets the place with kindly eye,      For the inmates that it had.\"                      THE LADY OF LA GARAYE.      Count Claude de la Garaye and his wife were young, beautiful, and endowed  with friends, riches, and all that could make life bright and happy. They  entertained with hospitality, and enjoyed the pleasures and amusements of  the world; when one day the Countess was thrown from her horse, the  expectations of an heir vanished, and she was left a cripple for life.  Both were inconsolable for their disappointment. One day a monk came to  visit them, and tried to comfort them, seeking by his converse to turn  their thoughts from earthly affections to heavenly consolation--    \"Ah! my father,\" said the lady, \"how happy are you, to love nothing on  earth!\"    \"You are mistaken,\" answered the monk; \"I love all those who are in sorrow  or suffering, and I submit myself to the will of the Almighty, and bend  myself with resignation to every blow He strikes.\"    He proceeded to show them there was still great happiness in store for  them, in ministering to the comforts of others. Following his counsel,  they went to Paris; for three years the Count studied medicine and  surgery, and his wife became a skilful oculist. On their return to La  Garaye, they gave up all the amusements of society, and devoted themselves  to relieving the sufferings of their fellow creatures. Their house was  converted into an hospital for the sick and the wounded, under the  ministering care of the Count and his benevolent wife:--          \"Her home is made their home; her wealth their dole;      Her busy courtyard hears no more the roll      Of gilded vehicles, or pawing steeds,      But feeble steps of those whose bitter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#8)"],[1," a pile  upon their heads! People do not realise the carrying power of a strained  and lowered voice. Generally the volume of sound is the same as when  speaking aloud, for the tone is merely lowered and the same amount of  breath is used. But often more force is required to vibrate the slackened  vocal chords, and the maddening sound reaches to every corner of the  building.    In the Reading Room of the British Museum one is constantly aware of this  buzzing going on all over the room. Would that the rule enforced at one  of our older monasteries were applied: 'In the Chafynghowys al brethren  schal speke latyn or els keep silence.' This would indeed ensure  quietness nowadays. The rule for nuns, however (who, presumably, were not  so well acquainted with Latin) would be better still. They were not to  speak at all.[15]    So, if it be possible, see to it that your library, study, sanctum, or  whatever you may call that one room in the house which is sacred to the  daughters of Mnemosyne, is really your own: that it be a close closet to  which you (and you alone) may retire at all seasons, certain in the  knowledge that by closing the door you may shut out effectually all  earthly cares and interruptions. Whether you are engaged in research  merely for the gratification of your desire to possess knowledge, or  whether literary production be your aim, unless you may study undisturbed  your labours will never bear their full fruit. Interrupted, your  knowledge will be scanty, diverse, and generally inapplicable, your  literary output sketchy, incoherent, and disconnected.    Perhaps it is this incubus of interruption that drives so many men to  working late at night. Doubtless those whose habit it is to work at that  season produce just as good work in those hours as at any other time;  possibly better, for habit may have accustomed them to put forth their  finest intellectual efforts at that time of day. But the mind that has  been brought up to rise at seven and go to bed at ten, is undoubtedly at  its best before noon. Night working is not a natural tendency, it is an  acquired habit; and though the expression 'burning the midnight oil' is  taken to be synonymous with the acquisition of learning, yet in the long  run it is but a poor economy of time, for the wisdom so acquired is often  obtained at the cost of health and eyesight.    And what is freedom from interruption but another name for solitude? It  may be temporary, it may be prolonged, it may be permanent, but for the  intellectual man it is absolutely essential. No one would be so foolish  as to deny that literary work of the highest rank can be, and has been  frequently, accomplished amid the bustle and noise of cities; witness the  works of those literary giants who have passed their lives as  town-dwellers. Doubtless they obtained the necessary solitude by  spiritual detachment. But on the other hand, for intense and prolonged  meditation, for the communing with one's innermost soul on the immense  principles of life and nature, for the production of such deep  soul-searching work as we see in the compositions of a Kempis, Dante,  Milton, and Wordsworth, absolute solitude for some seasons is essential.  There must be complete freedom from the daily distractions caused by  one's fellow-beings.    'Believe me, upon my own experience,' wrote St. Bernard, 'you will find  more in the woods than in books; the forests and rocks will teach you  what you cannot learn of the greatest masters.' It is not necessary,  however, for us to take up our abode in a cave that we may meditate  undisturbed. Let us rather follow Wordsworth's example when he pours  forth gratitude        'For my own peaceful lot and happy choice;       A choice that from the passions of the world       Withdrew, and fixed me in a still retreat;       Sheltered, but not to social duties lost,       Secluded, but not buried; and with song       Cheering my days, and with industrious thought;       With the ever-welcome company of books;       With virtuous friendship's soul-sustaining aid,       And with the blessings of domestic love.'    It is sufficient if we can withdraw at will into the solitudes. The  younger Pliny, moralising to his friend Minutius (I should like to think  him the progenitor of Aldo Manuccio), describes the delights of seclusion  at his villa on the shore of the Adriatic. 'At such a season,' says he,  in a retrospect of the day's work, 'one is apt to reflect _how much of my  life has been lost in trifles_! At least it is a reflection that  frequently comes across me at Laurentum, after I have been employing  myself in my studies, or even in the necessary care of the animal  machine; for the body must be repaired and supported if we would preserve  the mind in all its vigour. In that peaceful retreat I neither hear nor  speak anything of which I have occasion to repent. I suffer none to  repeat to me the whispers of malice; nor do I censure any man, unless  myself, when I am dissatisfied with my compositions. There I live  undisturbed by rumour, and free from the anxious solicitudes of hope or  fear, conversing only with myself and my books. True and genuine life!  Pleasing and honourable repose! More, perhaps, to be desired than the  noblest employments! Thou solemn lea and solitary shore, best and most  retired scene for contemplation, with how many noble thoughts have you  inspired me! Snatch then, my friend, as I have, the first occasion of  leaving the noisy town with all its very empty pursuits, and devote your  days to study, or even resign them to ease. For, as my ingenious friend  Attilius pleasantly said, 'It is better to do nothing than to be doing  nothings!''    The great Cardinal Ximenes, in the zenith of his power, built with his  own hands a hut in a thick unfrequented wood, where he could retire  occasionally from the busy world. Here he used to pass a few days, every  now and then, in meditation and study. These he was wont to describe as  the happiest days of his life, and declared that he would willingly  exchange all his dignities for his hut in the chestnut wood. Thomas  Aquinas, coming to visit the learned Bonaventura, asked him to point out  the books which he used in his studies. The monk led him into his cell  and showed him a few common volumes upon his table. Thomas explained that  the books he wished to see were those from which the learned master drew  so many wonders. Thereupon Bonaventura showed him a small oratory.  'There,' he said, 'are my books; that is the principal book from which I  draw all that I teach and write.'    To the thoughtless and those of shallow intellect solitude is inseparable  from loneliness. There is, for them, something terrible in the thought of  being debarred, even temporarily, from the society of their  fellow-beings. 'Retirement,' says Disraeli, 'to the frivolous is a vast  desert; to the man of genius it is the enchanted garden of Armida.' And  for 'man of genius' I would substitute 'man of literary pursuits.'    There is a pleasant story told of a monk who lived in the monastery of  St. Honorat, which is situated on one of the Lerine Islands, off the  coast of Provence. Possessed of a mind which, in the larger world, would  indubitably have become an influence in the artistic progress of mankind,  he found the sole outlet for its expression in the painting of those  exquisite miniatures which are at once the delight and the despair of a  more modern age. But it was not in the scriptorium nor was it in the  bestiaries or the examples of his predecessors that he acquired his art.  Every year, in the spring and autumn, he would go alone to one of the  delicious islands of Hyeres, where there was a small hermitage. Here he  would spend the weeks, not altogether in prayer and fasting, but in  making friends with the birds and small animals that resorted there;  studying their gestures, plumage, and colours, that he might reproduce  them faithfully on the vellum of his missals and devotional books. Surely  he learnt more on this deserted island than was possible at that time in  the richest library in France.    There is another kind of solitude, however, which can afford consolation  to the soul as deep and as lasting as that afforded by the woods, the  hills, the moors, the islands, those                                 'Waste      And solitary places; where we taste      The pleasure of believing what we see      Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be'--    and that is, the solitude engendered by a deep communion with books. For,  if our paths lie amid the toil and turmoil of the world, and if it be  impossible for us to seek seclusion amid the wastes, where else than in a  library can we obtain that mental solitude so necessary for the  nourishing of our literary spirit?    Roger Ascham, sick at heart with long parting from his beloved books,  writes to Sir William Cecil from Brussels in 1553, to beg that 'libertie  to lern, and leysor to wryte,' which his beloved Cambridge alone could  afford him. 'I do wel perceyve,' he says, 'their is no soch quietnesse in  England, nor pleasur in strange contres, as even in S. Jons Colledg, to  kepe company with the Bible, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, and Tullie.'  And he goes on to say, 'Thus I, first by myn own natur, . . . lastly  caulled by quietnesse, thought it good to couche myself in Cambridge  ageyn.'    Yet although we may seek solitude among our books, how far removed are we  from being really alone! 'A man is never less alone than when he is  alone,' said the noble Scipio[16]; and this is especially true of the  book-lover. What bibliophile does not prefer the companionship of his  books to that of all other friends? What friends so steadfast, so  reliable in their friendship, so helpful in our difficulties, so apt upon  all occasions, as the books which form our library? They are never elated  at our mistakes, they are never 'superior' when we"]]]
