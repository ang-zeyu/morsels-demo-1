(#8)"],[1,"it, had already cost the  king that sum, and, together with it, near double the money which had  been paid as the queen's portion.[*] The time fixed for payment of his  sister's portion to the duke of Orleans was approaching. Tangiers, a  fortress from which great benefit was expected, was become an additional  burden to the crown; and Rutherford, who now commanded in Dunkirk, had  increased the charge of that garrison to a hundred and twenty thousand  pounds a year. These considerations had such influence, not only on the  king, but even on Clarendon, that this uncorrupt minister was the most  forward to advise accepting a sum of money in lieu of a place which, he  thought, the king, from the narrow state of his revenue, was no longer  able to retain. By the treaty with Portugal, it was stipulated that  Dunkirk should never be yielded to the Spaniards; France was therefore  the only purchaser that remained. D'Estrades was invited over by a  letter from the chancellor himself, in order to conclude the bargain.  Nine hundred thousand pounds were demanded: one hundred thousand were  offered. The English by degrees lowered their demand; the French raised  their offer: and the bargain was concluded at four hundred thousand  pounds. The artillery and stores were valued at a fifth of the sum.[**]           * D'Estrades, 17th of August, 1662. There was above half of       five hundred thousand pounds really paid as the queen's       portion.         * D'Estrades, 21st of August, 12th of September, 1662.      The importance of this sale was not, at this time, sufficiently known,  either abroad or at home.[*] The French monarch himself, so fond of  acquisitions, and so good a judge of his own interests, thought that he  had made a hard bargain;[**] and this sum, in appearance so small, was  the utmost which he would allow his ambassador to offer.         * It appears, however, from many of D'Estrades's letters,       particularly that of the 21st of August, 1661, that the king       might have transferred Dunkirk to the parliament, who would       not have refused to bear the charges of it, but were       unwilling to give money to the king for that purpose. The       king, on the other hand, was jealous lest the parliament       should acquire any separate dominion or authority in a       branch of administration which seemed so little to belong to       them; a proof that the government was not yet settled into       that composure and mutual confidence which is absolutely       requisite for conducting it.         * D'Estrades, 3d of October, 1662. The chief importance,       indeed, of Dunkirk to the English was, that it was able to       distress their trade when in the hands of the French: but it       was Lewis XIV. who first made it a good seaport. If ever       England have occasion to transport armies to the continent,       it must be in support of some ally whose towns serve to the       same purpose as Dunkirk would, if in the hands of the       English.    A new incident discovered such a glimpse of the king's character and  principles as, at first, the nation was somewhat at a loss how  to interpret, but such as subsequent events, by degrees, rendered  sufficiently plain and manifest. He issued a declaration on pretence  of mitigating the rigors contained in the act of uniformity. After  expressing his firm resolution to observe the general indemnity, and to  trust entirely to the affections of his subjects, not to any military  power, for the support of his throne, he mentioned the promises of  liberty of conscience contained in his declaration of Breda. And he  subjoined, that, \"as in the first place he had been zealous to settle  the uniformity of the church of England, in discipline, ceremony, and  government, and shall ever constantly maintain it, so, as for what  concerns the penalties upon those who, living peaceably, do not conform  themselves thereunto, through scruple and tenderness of misguided  conscience, but modestly and without scandal perform their devotions in  their own way, he should make it his special care, so far as in him lay,  without invading the freedom of parliament, to incline their wisdom,  next approaching sessions, to concur with him in making some such act  for that purpose, as may enable him to exercise, with a more universal  satisfaction, that power of dispensing, which he conceived to be  inherent in him.\"[*] Here a most important prerogative was exercised  by the king; but under such artful reserves and limitations as might  prevent the full discussion of the claim, and obviate a breach between  him and his parliament. The foundation of this measure lay much deeper,  and was of the utmost consequence.    The king, during his exile, had imbibed strong prejudices a favor of  the Catholic religion; and, according to the most probable accounts,  had already been secretly reconciled in form to the church of Rome. The  great zeal expressed by the parliamentary party against all Papists,  had always, from a spirit of opposition, inclined the court and all the  royalists to adopt more favorable sentiments towards that sect, which,  through the whole course of the civil wars, had strenuously supported  the rights of the sovereign. The rigor, too, which the king, during his  abode in Scotland, had experienced from the Presbyterians, disposed him  to run into the other extreme, and to bear a kindness to the party  most opposite in its genius to the severity of those religionists. The  solicitations and importunities of the queen mother, the contagion of  the company which he frequented, the view of a more splendid and courtly  mode of worship, the hopes of indulgence in pleasure, all these causes  operated powerfully on a young prince, whose careless and dissolute  temper made him incapable of adhering closely to the principles of his  early education. But if the thoughtless humor of Charles rendered him  an easy convert to Popery, the same disposition ever prevented the  theological tenets of that sect from taking any fast hold of him. During  his vigorous state of health, while his blood was warm and his spirits  high, a contempt and disregard to all religion held possession of his  mind; and he might more properly be denominated a deist than a Catholic.  But in those revolutions of temper, when the love of raillery gave place  to reflection, and his penetrating, but negligent understanding was  clouded with fears and apprehensions, he had starts of mere sincere  conviction; and a sect which always possessed his inclination, was then  master of his judgment and opinion.[**]         * Kennet's Register, p. 850.         * The author confesses, that the king's zeal for Popery was       apt at intervals to go further than is here supposed, as       appears from many passages in James II.'s Memoirs.    But though the king thus fluctuated, during his whole reign, between  irreligion, which he more openly professed, and Popery, to which  he retained a secret propensity, his brother the duke of York, had  zealously adopted all the principles of that theological party. His  eager temper and narrow understanding made him a thorough convert,  without any reserve from interest, or doubts from reasoning and inquiry.  By his application to business, he had acquired a great ascendant over  the king; who, though possessed of more discernment, was glad to  throw the burden of affairs on the duke, of whom he entertained little  jealousy. On pretence of easing the Protestant dissenters, they agreed  upon a plan for introducing a general toleration, and giving the  Catholics the free exercise of their religion; at least the exercise of  it in private houses. The two brothers saw with pleasure so numerous and  popular a body of the clergy refuse conformity; and it was hoped that,  under shelter of their name, the small and hated sect of the Catholics  might meet with favor and protection.    {1663.} But while the king pleaded his early promises of toleration,  and insisted on many other plausible topics, the parliament, who sat a  little after the declaration was issued, could by no means be satisfied  with this measure. The declared intention of easing the dissenters, and  the secret purpose of favoring the Catholics, were equally disagreeable  to them and in these prepossessions they were encouraged by the king's  ministers themselves, particularly the chancellor. The house of commons  represented to the king, that his declaration of Breda contained  no promise to the Presbyterians and other dissenters, but only an  expression of his intentions, upon supposition of the concurrence of  parliament: that even if the nonconformists had been entitled to plead  a promise, they had intrusted this claim, as all their other rights and  privileges, to the house of commons, who were their representatives,  and who now freed the king from that obligation: that it was not to  be supposed, that his majesty and the houses were so bound by that  declaration, as to be incapacitated from making any laws which might be  contrary to it: that even at the king's restoration, there were laws  of uniformity in force, which could not be dispensed with but by act of  parliament: and that the indulgence intended would prove most pernicious  both to church and state, would open the door to schism, encourage  faction, disturb the public peace, and discredit the wisdom of the  legislature. The king did not think proper, after this remonstrance, to  insist any further at present on the project of indulgence.    In order to deprive the Catholics of all hopes, the two houses concurred  in a remonstrance against them. The king gave a gracious answer;  though he scrupled not to profess his gratitude towards many of that  persuasion, on account of their faithful services in his father's cause  and in his own. A proclamation, for form's sake, was soon after issued  against Jesuits and Romish priests: but care was taken, by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II.

KING JAMES CORDIALLY RECEIVED BY THE FRENCH KING.    After this sketch of Scottish affairs, it will be necessary to take  a retrospective view of James, and relate the particulars of his  expedition to Ireland. That unfortunate prince and his queen were  received with the most cordial hospitality by the French monarch, who  assigned the castle of St. Germain for the place of their residence,  supported their household with great magnificence, enriched them with  presents, and undertook to re-establish them on the throne of England.  James, however, conducted himself in such a manner as conveyed no  favourable idea of his spirit and understanding. He seems to have been  emasculated by religion: he was deserted by that courage and magnanimity  for which his youth had been distinguished. He did not discover great  sensibility at the loss of his kingdom. All his faculties were swallowed  up in bigotry. Instead of contriving plans for retrieving his crown, he  held conferences with the Jesuits on topics of religion. The pity which  his misfortunes excited in Louis was mingled with contempt. The pope  supplied him with indulgencies, while the Romans laughed at him in  pasquinades: \"There is a pious man, (said the archbishop of Rheims  ironically,) who has sacrificed three crowns for a mass.\" In a word, he  subjected himself to the ridicule and raillery of the French nation.          TYRCONNEL TEMPORIZES WITH WILLIAM.    All the hope of re-ascending the British throne depended upon his  friends in Scotland and Ireland. Tyr-connel, who commanded in this last  kingdom, was confirmed in his attachment to James by the persuasions of  Hamilton, who had undertaken for his submission to the prince of Orange.  Nevertheless, he disguised his sentiments, and temporized with William,  until James should be able to supply him with reinforcements from  France, which he earnestly solicited by private messages. In the  meantime, with a view to cajole the protestants of Ireland, and  amuse king William with hope of his submission, he persuaded the lord  Mountjoy, in whom the protestants chiefly confided, and baron Rice, to  go in person with a commission to James, representing the necessity of  yielding to the times, and of waiting a fitter opportunity to make use  of his Irish subjects. Mountjoy, on his arrival at Paris, instead of  being favoured with an audience by James, to explain the reasons which  Tyrconnel had suggested touching the inability of Ireland to restore his  majesty, was committed prisoner to the Bastile, on account of the zeal  with which he had espoused the protestant interest. Although Louis was  sincerely disposed to assist James effectually, his intentions were  obstructed by the disputes of his ministry. Louvois possessed the chief  credit in council; but Seignelai enjoyed a greater share of personal  favour, both with the king and madame de Maintenon, the favourite  concubine. To this nobleman, as secretary for marine affairs, James made  his chief application; and he had promised the command of the troops  destined for his service to Latisun, whom Louvois hated. For these  reasons this minister thwarted his measures, and retarded the assistance  which Louis had promised towards his restoration.          JAMES ARRIVES IN IRELAND.    Yet notwithstanding all his opposition, the succours were prepared and  the fleet ready to put to sea by the latter end of February. The French  king is said to have offered an army of fifteen thousand natives of  France to serve in this expedition; but James replied, that he would  succeed by the help of his own subjects, or perish in the attempt.  Accordingly, he contented himself with about twelve hundred British  subjects, [010] _[See note E, at the end of this Vol.]_ and a good  number of French officers, who were embarked in the fleet at Brest,  consisting of fourteen ships of the line, seven frigates, three  fire-ships, with a good number of transports. The French king also  supplied him with a considerable quantity of arms for the use of his  adherents in Ireland; accommodated him with a large sum of money, superb  equipages, store of plate, and necessaries of all kinds for the camp  and the household. At parting he presented him with his own cuirass, and  embracing him affectionately, \"The best thing I can wish you (said he)  is, that I may never see you again.\" On the seventh day of March, James  embarked at Brest, together with the count D'Avaux, who accompanied him  in quality of ambassador, and his principal officers. He was detained  in the harbour by contrary winds till the seventeenth day of the month,  when he set sail, and on the twenty-second landed at Kinsale in Ireland.  By this time, king William perceiving himself amused by Tyrconnel, had  published a declaration, requiring the Irish to lay down their arms  and submit to the new government. On the twenty-second day of February,  thirty ships of war had been put in commission, and the command of them  conferred upon admiral Herbert; but the armament was retarded in such  a manner by the disputes of the council and the king's attention to the  affairs of the continent, that the admiral was not in a condition to  sail till the beginning of April, and then with part of his fleet only.  James was received with open arms at Kinsale, and the whole country  seemed to be at his devotion; for although the protestants in the North  had declared for the new government, their strength and number was  deemed inconsiderable when compared with the power of Tyrconnel. This  minister had disarmed all the other protestant subjects in one day, and  assembled an army of thirty thousand foot, and eight thousand cavalry,  for the service of his master.          ISSUES FIVE PROCLAMATIONS AT DUBLIN.    In the latter end of March, James made his public entry into Dublin,  amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. He was met at the  castle-gate by a procession of popish bishops and priests in their  pontificals, bearing the host, which he publicly adored. He dismissed  from the council-board the lord Granard, judge Keating, and other  protestants, who had exhorted the lord lieutenant to an accommodation  with the new government. In their room he admitted the French  ambassador, the bishop of Chester, colonel Darrington, and, by degrees,  the principal noblemen who accompanied him in the expedition. On the  second day after his arrival in Dublin, he issued five proclamations:  the first recalled all the subjects of Ireland who had abandoned the  kingdom, by a certain time, on pain of outlawry and confiscation, and  requiring all persons to join him against the prince of Orange. The  second contained expressions of acknowledgement to his catholic subjects  for their vigilance and fidelity, and an injunction to such as were not  actually in his service, to retain and lay up their arms until it  should be found necessary to use them for his advantage. By the third he  invited the subjects to supply his army with provisions; and prohibited  the soldiers to take anything without payment. By the fourth he raised  the value of the current coin; and in the fifth he summoned a parliament  to meet on the seventh day of May, at Dublin. Finally, he created  Tyrconnel a duke, in consideration of his eminent services.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          SIEGE OF LONDONDERRY.    The adherents of James in England pressed him to settle the affairs  of Ireland immediately, and bring over his army either to the north of  England, or the west of Scotland, where it might be joined by his party,  and act without delay against the usurper; but his council dissuaded him  from complying with their solicitations, until Ireland should be totally  reduced to obedience. On the first alarm of an intended massacre, the  protestants of Londonderry had shut their gates against the regiment  commanded by the earl of Antrim, and resolved to defend themselves  against the lord lieutenant. They transmitted this resolution to the  government of England, together with an account of the danger they  incurred by such a vigorous measure, and implored immediate assistance.  They were accordingly supplied with some arms and ammunition, but did  not receive any considerable reinforcement till the middle of April,  when two regiments arrived in Loughfoyl, under the command of Cunningham  and Richards. By this time king James had taken Coleraine, invested  Killmore, and was almost in sight of Londonderry. George Walker,  rector of Donaghmore, who had raised a regiment for the defence of the  protestants, conveyed this intelligence to Lundy the governor. This  officer directed him to join colonel Grafton, and take post at the  Long-causey, which he maintained a whole night against the advanced  guard of the enemy; until being overpowered by numbers, he retreated to  Londonderry and exhorted the governor to take the field, as the army of  king James was not yet completely formed. Lundy assembling a council of  war, at which Cunningham and Richards assisted; they agreed, that as the  place was not tenable, it would be imprudent to land the two regiments,  and that the principal officers should withdraw themselves from  Londonderry, the inhabitants of which would obtain the more favourable  capitulation in consequence of their retreat. An officer was immediately  dispatched to king James with proposals of a negotiation; and  lieutenant-general Hamilton agreed that the army should halt at the  distance of four miles from the town. Notwithstanding this preliminary,  James advanced at the head of his troops; but met with such a warm  reception from the besieged, that he was fain to retire to St. John's  Town in some disorder. The inhabitants and soldiers in garrison at  Londonderry were so incensed at the "]]]
