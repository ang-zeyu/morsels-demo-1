His father was a hatter, and when Peter was eight years old he  pulled hair from rabbit skins for hat pulp.    Year after year he worked harder than he was able, but he was  determined to win.    When his eight little brothers and sisters needed shoes, he ripped  up an old one to see how it was made. Always after that he made the  shoes for the family.    Do you think a lazy boy would have done that?    When he was seventeen, he bade his anxious mother good-bye, and  started for New York to make his fortune.    Do you know what a lottery is?    It is a way dishonest people have of making money.    Tickets are sold for prizes, and of course only one person can get  the prize, while all the rest must lose their money.    Soon after Peter Cooper reached New York he saw an advertisement of  a lottery.    He might draw a prize by buying a ticket.    Each ticket cost ten dollars.    Peter had just that much money.    He thought the matter over carefully.    He wished very much to have some money, for then he could help his  mother.    So he bought a ticket, and drew--nothing.    Poor boy! he was now penniless.    But he never touched games of chance again.    Years afterward he used to say, \"It was the cheapest piece of  knowledge I ever bought.\"    Day after day the tall, slender boy walked the streets of New York  looking for work.    At last he found a place.    It was in a carriage shop.    Here he bound himself as apprentice for five years at two dollars a  month and board.    You see he could buy no good clothes.    He had no money for cigars or pleasures of any kind.    He helped to bring carriages for rich men's sons to ride in.    There is an old saying, that \"everybody has to walk at one end of  life,\" and they are fortunate who walk at the beginning and ride at  the close.    When his day's work was over he liked to read.    His companions made fun of him because he would not join them.    He made a little money by extra work.    He hired a teacher, to whom he recited evenings.    He was often very tired, but he never complained.    He had many friends because he was always good-natured.    He used often to say to himself, \"If ever I get rich I will build a  place where the poor girls and boys of New York may have an  education free.\"    Wasn't that a queer thought for a boy who earned only fifty cents a  week?    Yet perhaps his even dreaming such dreams helped him to do the great  things of which I shall tell you.    Now, Peter noticed that the tools which they worked with in the  carriage shop were not very good.    So he began to try to make better ones.    He succeeded in doing so, but Mr. Woodward, the man for whom he  worked, had all the benefit of his work.    But at last Peter's apprenticeship was over.    Much to his surprise Mr. Woodward one day called him into his  office.    \"You have been very faithful,\" he said, \"and I will set you up in a  carriage manufactory of your own.    \"You could pay me back the money borrowed in a few years.\"    This was a remarkable offer for a poor young man.    But Peter had made it a solemn rule of his life never to go in debt.    So he thanked Mr. Woodward very earnestly, but declined his offer.    It was then Mr. Woodward's turn to be astonished.    But he knew Peter was right, and respected his good judgment in the  matter.    We may now call Peter Cooper a mechanic.    A mechanic is one who has skill in using tools in shaping wood,  metals, etc.    Peter now found a situation in a woolen mill at Hempstead, Long  Island.    Here he received nine dollars a week.    Still he kept trying to find better ways of doing things.    He invented a machine for shearing cloth, and from that earned five  hundred dollars in two years.    With so much money as this he could not rest until he had visited  his mother.    He found his parents deeply in debt.    He gave them the whole of his money, and promised to do more than  that.    His father had not made a mistake in naming him after the Apostle  Peter.    During this time Mr. Cooper had learned to know a beautiful girl  named Sarah Bedell. This girl became his wife.    They moved to New York.    Here Mr. Cooper had a grocery-store.    A friend advised him to buy a glue factory which was for sale.    He knew nothing of the business, but he thought he could learn it.    He soon made not only the best glue, but the cheapest in the  country.    For thirty years he carried on this business almost alone, with no  salesman and no book-keeper.    He rose every morning at daylight, kindled his factory fires, and  worked all the forenoon making glue.    In the afternoon he sold it.    In the evenings he kept his accounts, wrote his letters, and read  with his wife and children.    He worked this way long after he had an income of thirty thousand  dollars a year.    This was not because he wanted to have so much more money for  himself.    You remember he had a plan to carry out which would take much  money.    That was to build his free school for the poor.    He had no time for parties or pleasures.    But the people of New York knew he was both honest and intelligent.    They asked him to be a member of the City Council, and President of  their Board of Education.    Peter Cooper never refused to do anything which might help others.    So he did not refuse these offices.    I must tell you now about Mr. Cooper's first child, and how fine a  thing it was to have an inventor for a papa.    Mr. Cooper made for this baby a self-rocking cradle, with a fan  attached to keep off the flies, and with a musical instrument to  soothe the dear baby into dreamland.    Mr. Cooper's business prospered.      [Illustration: THE \"BEST FRIEND,\"--FIRST LOCOMOTIVE BUILT IN    AMERICA. BUILT BY PETER COOPER.]    Once the glue factory burned, with a loss of forty thousand dollars.    But at nine o'clock the next morning there was lumber on the ground  for a factory three times as large as the one burned.    He then built a rolling mill and furnace in Baltimore.    They were then trying to build the Baltimore and Ohio railroad.    Only thirteen miles of the road had been finished.    The directors were about to give up the work.    There were many sharp turns in the track.    The directors were discouraged because they thought no engine could  be made to make those turns.    Mr. Cooper knew that this road would help his rolling mill.    Nothing could discourage him.      [Illustration: FIRST TRAIN IN AMERICA.]    He went to work and made the first locomotive made in America.    He attached a box-car to it.    Then he invited the directors to take a ride.    He took the place of engineer himself.    Away they flew over the thirteen miles in an hour.    The directors took courage, and the road was soon finished.    Years after, when Mr. Cooper had become a great man, he was invited  to visit Baltimore.    The old engine was brought out, much to the delight of the people,  who cheered again and again at sight of it.    Mr. Cooper soon built at Trenton, N.J., the largest rolling mill in  the United States.    He also built a large blast furnace, and steel and wire works in  different parts of Pennsylvania.      [Illustration: NEW YORK CENTRAL EMPIRE STATE EXPRESS. FASTEST    LOCOMOTIVE IN THE WORLD. \"ENGINE 999.\"    Copyrighted by A.P. Yates, by permission of New York Central R.R.]    He bought the Andover iron mines.    He built eight miles of railroad in this rough country.    Over this road he carried forty thousand tons a year.    The poor boy, who once earned but twenty-five dollars a year, had  become a millionaire.    No good luck accomplished this.    But these are the things that did it:        Hard work.      Living within his means.      Saving his time.      Common sense, which helped him to look carefully before he        invested his money.      Promptness.      Keeping his word.    Mr. Cooper was honorable in all his business.    Once he said to a friend who had an interest in the Trenton works:    \"I do not feel quite easy about the amount we are making. We are  making too much money. It is not right.\"    The price was made lower at once.    Do you not think Peter Cooper was an unusual kind of a man to lower  the price of an article just because the world needed it so much?    He was now sixty-four years of age.    He had worked day and night for forty years to build his Free  College.    He had bought the ground for it.    And now for five whole years he watched his great, six-story,  brown-stone building as it grew.    The man who was once a penniless lad should teach many through these  great stones some of the lessons he knew so well.    Some of these are industry, economy and perseverance.    The words which he wrote and placed in a box in the corner stone are  not too hard for you to read.    \"The great object that I desire to accomplish by the erection of  this Institution is to open the avenues of scientific knowledge to  the youth of our city and country, and so unfold the volume of  Nature that the young may see the beauties of creation, enjoy its  blessings, and learn to love the Author from whom cometh every good  and perfect gift.\"    But would the poor young men and women of New York who worked hard  all day care for an education?    Some people said no.    But Mr. Cooper thought of his own boyhood, and believed that young  people loved books, and would be glad of a chance to study them.      [Illustration: COOPER INSTITUTE, NEW YORK CITY.]    And when the grand building was opened students crowded in from the  shops and factories.    Some were worn and tired, as Peter Cooper had often been in his  youth.    But they studied eagerly in spite of that.    Every Saturday night two thousand came together in the great hall.    There the most famous people in the world lectured before them.    Every year nearly five hundred thousand read in the free library and  reading rooms.

THIRD PART.    _DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTELLECT._      The development of the intellect depends in so great measure upon the  modification of innate endowments through natural environment and  education, even before systematic instruction begins, and the methods of  education are so manifold, that it is at present impossible to make a  complete exposition of a normal intellectual development. Such an  exposition would necessarily comprise in the main two stages:    1. The _combination_ of sensuous _impressions_ into _perceptions_  (Wahrnehmungen); which consists essentially in this--that the sensation,  impressing itself directly upon our experience, is by the intellect, now  beginning to act, co-ordinated in space and time.    2. The _combination_ of _perceptions_ into _ideas_; in particular into  _sense-intuitions_ and _concepts_. A sense-intuition (Anschauung) is a  perception together with its cause, the object of the sensation; a  concept (Begriff) results from the union of the previously separated  perceptions, which are then called separate marks or qualities.    The investigation of each of these stages in the child is in itself a  great labor, which an individual may indeed begin upon, but can not  easily carry through uniformly in all directions.    I have indeed tried to collect recorded facts, but have found only  very little trustworthy material, and accordingly I confine myself  essentially to my own observations on my child. These are not merely  perfectly trustworthy, even to the minutest details (I have left out  everything of a doubtful character), but they are the most  circumstantial ever published in regard to the intellectual  development of a child. But I have been acquainted with a sufficient  number of other children to be certain that the child observed by me  did not _essentially_ differ from other healthy and intelligent boys  in regard to the principal points, although the time at which  development takes place, and the rapidity of it, differ a good deal in  different individuals. Girls often appear to learn to speak earlier  than boys; but further on they seem to possess a somewhat inferior  capacity of development of the logical functions, or to accomplish  with less ease abstractions of a higher order; whereas in boys the  emotional functions, however lasting their reactions, are not so  delicately graduated as in girls.    Without regard to such differences, of which I am fully aware, the  following chapters treat exclusively of the development of purely  intellectual cerebral activity in both sexes during the first years.  I acknowledge, however, that I have found the investigation of the  influence of the affectional movements, or emotions, upon the  development of the intellect in the child during the first years  so difficult, that I do not for the present enter into details  concerning it.    The observations relate, first, to the non-dependence of the child's  intellect upon language; next, to the acquirement of speech; lastly,  to the development of the feeling of self, the \"I\"-feeling.          CHAPTER XVI.    DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD'S INTELLECT INDEPENDENTLY OF LANGUAGE.      A wide-spread prejudice declares, \"Without language, no understanding\"!  Subtile distinctions between understanding and reason have limited the  statement to the latter term. But even in the restricted form, \"Without  verbal language, no reason,\" it is at least unproved.    _Is there any thinking without words?_ The question takes this shape.    Now, for the thinker, who has long since forgotten the time when he  himself learned to speak, it is difficult, or even impossible, to give a  decided answer. For the thinking person can not admit that he has been  thinking without words; not even when he has caught himself arriving at  a logical result without a continuity in his unexpressed thought. A  break occurred in the train. There was, however, a train of thought.  Breaks alone yield no thought; they arise only after words have been  associated with thoughts, and so they can by no means serve as evidence  of a thinking without words, although the ecstasy of the artist, the  profundity of the meta-physician, may attain the last degree of  unconsciousness, and a dash may interrupt the thought-text.    But the child not yet acquainted with verbal language, who has not been  prematurely artificialized by training and by suppression of his own  attempts to express his states of mind, who learns _of himself_ to  _think_, just as he learns of himself to see and hear--such a child  shows plainly to the attentive observer that long before knowledge of  the word as a means of understanding among men, and long before the  first successful attempt to express himself in articulate words--nay,  long before learning the pronunciation of even a single word, he  combines ideas in a logical manner--i. e., he _thinks_. Thinking is,  it is true, \"internal speech,\" but there is a speech without words.    Facts in proof of this have already been given in connection with  other points (Vol. I, pp. 88, 327, 328); others are given further on.    It will not be superfluous, however, to put together several  observations relating to the development of the childish intellect  without regard to the acquirement of speech; and to present them  separately, as a sort of introduction to the investigation of the  process of learning to speak.    Memory; a causative combination of the earliest recollections, or  memory-images; purposive, deliberate movements for the lessening of  individual strain--all these come to the child in greater or less  measure independently of verbal language. The, as it were, embryonic  logic of the child does not need words. A brief explanation of the  operation of these three factors will show this. Memory takes the  first place in point of time.    Without memory no intellect is possible. The only material at the  disposal of the intellect is received from the senses. It has been  provided solely out of sensations. Now a sensation in itself alone, as  a simple fundamental experience affecting primarily the one who has  the sensation, can not be the object of any intellectual operation  whatever. In order to make such activity possible there must be  several sensations: two of different kinds, of unequal strength; or  two of different kinds, of the same strength; or two of the same kind  unequally strong; in any case, two unlike sensations (cf. my treatise  \"Elemente der reinen Empfindungslehre,\" Jena, 1876), if the lowest  activity of the intellect, _comparison_, is to operate. But because  the sensations that are to be compared can not all exist together,  recollection of the earlier ones is necessary (for the comparison);  that is, individual or personal memory.    This name I give to the memory formed by means of individual impressions  (occurrences, experiences) in contrast with the _phyletic_ memory, or  instinct, the memory of the race, which results from the inheritance of  the traces of individual experiences of ancestors; of this I do not here  speak.    All sensations leave traces behind in the brain; weak ones leave such as  are easy to be obliterated by others; strong ones, traces more enduring.    At the beginning of life it seems to be the department of taste (sweet)  and of smell (smell of milk) in which memory is first operative (Vol. I,  p. 124). Then comes the sense of touch (in nursing). Next in order the  sense of sight chiefly asserts itself as an early promoter of memory.  Hearing does not come till later.    If the infant, in the period from three to six months of age, is brought  into a room he has not before seen, his expression changes; he is  astonished. The new sensations of light, the different apportionment of  light and dark, arouse his attention; and when he comes back to his  former"]]]
