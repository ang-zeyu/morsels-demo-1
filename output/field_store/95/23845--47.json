We agreed, and the  ceremony began. A large muscle shell was washed in the kettle, the plates  were set in order at the foot of the altar, a censer began to smoke, the  silver plate with candied sugar was set over a lamp Between two bells,  whose handles were the most monstrous figures of idols. These bells  Amintaas took and began to ring vehemently. The other Hindoos stood behind  him and beat two big cymbals, accompanying this noise with the most  inhuman and frightful howling that a man's lungs ever produced. Still,  there was method and a regular cadence in it. Finally, they made a pause,  bowed before the images, murmuring softly, after which they arranged the  plates anew, and sprinkled the sugar with holy water. My husband whispered  in my ear a line from the conjuration in \"Faust,\" and the whole of that  scene rushed vividly into my memory.    Meanwhile the lungs of the old Amintaas had recovered their power, for he  now seized a conch shell, held it in both hands, and with incredible  strength blew long wild notes, with scarce any thing like a tune. I grew  dizzy in listening to this clamor, and at once understood what is meant by  the heathen making a \"vain noise,\" This cannibalistic music was kept up  for a long time, and seemed to form the climax of the sacred rites. The  finale was a combination of wild shouting, banging of the cymbals, ringing  and murmuring. At last the concert was over, and we breathed freely.  Amintaas handed us the candied sugar, and my husband laid down two ducats  in its place. They were received with warm expressions of gratitude, and  laid upon the altar. We went out into the open air, but the scene had  changed. The lonely castle was crowded with Persians who had come from  their lime-burning to see the Europeans. Persian women were sitting around  by sundry little ovens of masonry, where, by the help of gas flames, they  baked their _Tsheuks_, thin cakes of unleavened bread. Followed by the  crowd, we were led a couple of hundred steps from the castle to a spring  that was covered over; the cover was taken off, and a bundle of burning  straw thrown in, when, crackling and hissing, sprung up a splendid pillar  of fire, vanishing in sparks like stars. This beautiful spectacle lasted  but for a moment, and a quarter of an hour was necessary to collect gas  enough to repeat the experiment.    We returned to Baku in the rain, more dead than alive. It was the eve of  Easter. The next morning, as I was sitting on the sofa with the children,  there came in a tall, meagre Hindoo, with gray hair; he was dressed in a  white robe, and brought me white and red sugar on a silver plate. He was  the chief priest from the temple of the Gebers, and had come to Baku to  see the Easter festivities. We took a few grains of his sugar, and I laid  a silver rouble on the plate. While he was making his bows for this, my  husband came in and told him, partly in Tartar, partly in Russian, and  partly in pantomime, that we had been to his temple the night before, and  had prayers said there. He asked at once, with eagerness, how much we had  given, and when he learned the sum, asked for a certificate to that  effect, as, without it, the others would give him no part of the money. We  sent him away without granting his request, for the two screamers of the  night previous had earned all we gave them. We learned afterwards that the  gifts of visitors occasioned quarrels, and often blows, in the romantic  fire-castle. This disgusted me, and yet it is not the fault of these poor  fellows. They must necessarily become covetous, since they profane their  most sacred ceremonies as a means of living. They have neither fields nor  gardens, and the only thing like vegetation that I saw was some lone boxes  in the court yard, filled with shrubs and plants, remains, no doubt, from  the time of the Indian nabob, who sought in vain to establish cultivation  in a soil impregnated with inflammable gas. However, I learned to my  sorrow that grass at least grows there, for, in going through it to the  spring, my feet became perfectly wet.    The air of the locality does not seem to be unwholesome for man. At least,  the Geber priests, who had lived there for years, were perfect lions for  health and vigor.            A NEW PORTRAIT OF CICERO.      In the third volume of his _History of the Romans under the Empire_, just  published in London, Mr. MERIVALE gives some elaborate pieces of character  writing, one of which has for its subject CICERO. It is not good for a man  to think harshly of Cicero, and however easy it may seem to be to condemn  manifest faults in his character, it is by no means easy to be fair in the  estimate we make. Mr. Merivale sums up a character which has too often  been roughly put down as that of a great writer and a little man, as  follows:          \"Many writers, it has been remarked, have related the death of      Cicero, but Plutarch alone has painted it. In the narrative here      laid before him the reader has the substance of this picturesque      account, together with some touches introduced from collateral      sources. In this, as in many other massages of his Lives, the      Greek biographer has evidently aimed at creating an effect, and      though he seems to have been mainly guided by the genuine      narrative of Tiro, Cicero's beloved freedman, we may suspect him      of having embellished it to furnish a striking termination to one      of his favorite sketches. Nevertheless the narrative is mainly      confirmed by a fragment of Livy's history, which has fortunately      been preserved. The Roman author vies with the Greek in throwing      dignity and interest over the great statesman's end. But in      reviewing the uneven tenor of his career, Livy concludes with the      stern comment, \"He bore none of his calamities as a man should,      except his death.\" These are grave words. In the mouth of one who      had cast his scrutinizing glance over the characters and exploits      of all the heroes of the great republic, and had learnt by the      training of his life-long studies to discriminate moral qualities      and estimate desert, they constitute the most important judgment      on the conduct of Cicero that antiquity has bequeathed to us. Few      indeed among the Romans ever betrayed a want of resolution in the      face of impending death. But it was in the endurance of calamity      rather than the defiance of danger that the courage of Cicero was      deficient. The orator, whose genius lay in the arts of peace and      persuasion, exhibited on more than one occasion a martial spirit      worthy of other habits and a ruder training. In the contest with      Catilina he displayed all the moral confidence of a veteran      general: in the struggle with Antonius he threw himself without      reserve into a position where there was no alternative but to      conquer or to perish. In the earlier conflict he had still his      fame to acquire, his proud ascendency to establish; and the love      of praise and glory inspired him with the audacity which makes and      justifies its own success. But in the later, he courted danger for      the sake of retaining the fame he so dearly prized. He had once      saved his country, and he could not endure that it should be said      he had ever deserted it. He loved his country; but it wan for his      own honor, which he could preserve, rather than for his country's      freedom, which he despaired of, that he returned to his post when      escape was still possible. He might have remained silent, but he      opened the floodgates of his eloquence. When indeed he had once      launched himself on the torrent he lost all self-command; he could      neither retrace nor moderate his career; he saw the rocks before      him, but he dashed himself headlong against them. But another      grave authority has given us the judgment of antiquity, that      Cicero's defect was the want of steadfastness. His courage had no      dignity because it lacked consistency. All men and all parties      agreed that he could not be relied upon to lead, to co-operate, or      to follow. In all the great enterprises of his party, he was left      behind, except that which the nobles undertook against Catilina,      in which they rather thrust him before them than engaged with him      on terms of mutual support. When we read the vehement claims which      Cicero put forth to the honor of association, however tardy, with      the glories and dangers of Caesar's assassins, we should deem the      conspirators guilty of a monstrous oversight in having neglected      to enlist him in their design, were we not assured that he was not      to be trusted as a confederate either for good or for evil.        \"Of all the characters of antiquity Cicero is undoubtedly that      with which we are most intimately acquainted; for he alone has      left to us the record of his thoughts and actions for more than      half his public career in a voluminous mass of familiar as well as      political correspondence. No public character probably could pass      unscathed through the fiery ordeal to which he has thus subjected      himself. Cicero, it must be avowed, is convicted from his own      mouth of vanity, inconstancy, sordidness, jealousy, malice,      selfishness, and timidity. But on the other hand no character,      public or private, could thus bare its workings to our view      without laying a stronger claim to our sympathy, and extorting      from us more kindly consideration than we can give to the mere      shell of the human being with which ordinary history brings us in      contact. Cicero gains more than he loses by the confessions he      pours into our ear.

[Sidenote: The conception of God is attained by inward experience, that  is, by the observation of certain remarkable thoughts and feelings which  are attributed to the inspiration of a deity. Practical dangers of the  theory of inspiration.]    In the first place, then, men in many lands and many ages have  experienced certain extraordinary emotions and entertained certain  extraordinary ideas, which, unable to account for them by reference to  the ordinary forms of experience, they have set down to the direct  action of a powerful spirit or deity working on their minds and even  entering into and taking possession of their bodies; and in this excited  state--for violent excitement is characteristic of these  manifestations--the patient believes himself to be possessed of  supernatural knowledge and supernatural power. This real or supposed  mode of apprehending a divine spirit and entering into communion with  it, is commonly and appropriately called inspiration. The phenomenon is  familiar to us from the example of the Hebrew nation, who believed that  their prophets were thus inspired by the deity, and that their sacred  books were regularly composed under the divine afflatus. The belief is  by no means singular, indeed it appears to be world-wide; for it would  be hard to point to any race of men among whom instances of such  inspiration have not been reported; and the more ignorant and savage the  race the more numerous, to judge by the reports, are the cases of  inspiration. Volumes might be filled with examples, but through the  spread of information as to the lower races in recent years the topic  has become so familiar that I need not stop to illustrate it by  instances. I will merely say that among savages the theory of  inspiration or possession is commonly invoked to explain all abnormal  mental states, particularly insanity or conditions of mind bordering on  it, so that persons more or less crazed in their wits, and particularly  hysterical or epileptic patients, are for that very reason thought to be  peculiarly favoured by the spirits and are therefore consulted as  oracles, their wild and whirling words passing for the revelations of a  higher power, whether a god or a ghost, who considerately screens his  too dazzling light under a thick veil of dark sayings and mysterious  ejaculations.[2] I need hardly point out the very serious dangers which  menace any society where such theories are commonly held and acted upon.  If the decisions of a whole community in matters of the gravest  importance are left to turn on the wayward fancies, the whims and  vagaries of the insane or the semi-insane, what are likely to be the  consequences to the commonwealth? What, for example, can be expected to  result from a war entered upon at such dictation and waged under such  auspices? Are cattle-breeding, agriculture, commerce, all the arts of  life on which a people depend for their subsistence, likely to thrive  when they are directed by the ravings of epilepsy or the drivellings of  hysteria? Defeat in battle, conquest by enemies, death by famine and  widespread disease, these and a thousand other lesser evils threaten the  blind people who commit themselves to such blind guides. The history of  savage and barbarous tribes, could we follow it throughout, might  furnish us with a thousand warning instances of the fatal effects of  carrying out this crude theory of inspiration to its logical  conclusions; and if we hear less than might be expected of such  instances, it is probably because the tribes who consistently acted up  to their beliefs have thereby wiped themselves out of existence: they  have perished the victims of their folly and left no record behind. I  believe that historians have not yet reckoned sufficiently with the  disastrous influence which this worship of insanity,--for it is often  nothing less--has exercised on the fortunes of peoples and on the  development or decay of their institutions.    [Sidenote: The belief in inspiration leads to the worship of living men  as gods. Outward experience as a source of the idea of God.]    To a certain extent, however, the evil has provided its own remedy. For  men of strong heads and ambitious temper, perceiving the exorbitant  power which a belief in inspiration places in the hands of the  feeble-minded, have often feigned to be similarly afflicted, and trading  on their reputation for imbecility, or rather inspiration, have acquired  an authority over their fellows which, though they have often abused it  for vulgar ends, they have sometimes exerted for good, as for example by  giving sound advice in matters of public concern, applying salutary  remedies to the sick, and detecting and punishing crime, whereby they  have helped to preserve the commonwealth, to alleviate suffering, and to  cement that respect for law and order which is essential to the  stability of society, and without which any community must fall to  pieces like a house of cards. These great services have been rendered to  the cause of civilisation and progress by the class of men who in  primitive society are variously known as medicine-men, magicians,  sorcerers, diviners, soothsayers, and so forth. Sometimes the respect  which they have gained by the exercise of their profession has won for  them political as well as spiritual or ghostly authority; in short, from  being simple medicine-men or sorcerers they have grown into chiefs and  kings. When such men, seated on the throne of state, retain their old  reputation for being the vehicles of a divine spirit, they may be  worshipped in the character of gods as well as revered in the capacity  of kings; and thus exerting a two-fold sway over the minds of men they  possess a most potent instrument for elevating or depressing the  fortunes of their worshippers and subjects. In this way the old savage  notion of inspiration or possession gradually develops into the doctrine  of the divinity of kings, which after a long period of florescence  dwindles away into the modest theory that kings reign by divine right, a  theory familiar to our ancestors not long ago, and perhaps not wholly  obsolete among us even now. However, inspired men need not always  blossom out into divine kings; they may, and often do, remain in the  chrysalis state of simple deities revered by their simple worshippers,  their brows encircled indeed with a halo of divinity but not weighted  with the more solid substance of a kingly crown. Thus certain  extraordinary mental states, which those who experience and those who  witness them cannot account for in any other way, are often explained by  the supposed interposition of a spirit or deity. This, therefore, is one  of the two forms of experience by which men attain, or imagine that they  attain, to a knowledge of God and a communion with him. It is what I  have called the road of inward experience. Let us now glance at the  other form of experience which leads, or seems to lead, to the same  goal. It is what I have called the road of outward experience.    [Sidenote: Tendency of the mind to search for causes, and the necessity  for their discovery.]    When we contemplate the seemingly infinite variety, the endless  succession, of events that pass under our observation in what we call  the external world, we are led by an irresistible tendency to trace what  we call a causal connexion between them. The tendency to discover the  causes of things appears indeed to be innate in the constitution of our  minds and indispensable to our continued existence. It is the link that  arrests and colligates into convenient bundles the mass of particulars  drifting pell-mell past on the stream of sensation; it is the cement  that binds into an edifice seemingly of adamant the loose sand of  isolated perceptions. Deprived of the knowledge which this tendency  procures for us we should be powerless to foresee the succession of  phenomena and so to adapt ourselves to it. We should be bewildered by  the apparent disorder and confusion of everything, we should toss on a  sea without a rudder, we should wander in an endless maze without a  clue, and finding no way out of it, or, in plain words, unable to avoid  a single one of the dangers which menace us at every turn, we should  inevitably perish. Accordingly the propensity to search for causes is  characteristic of man in all ages and at all levels of culture, though  without doubt it is far more highly developed in civilised than in  savage communities. Among savages it is more or less unconscious and  instinctive; among civilised men it is deliberately cultivated and  rewarded at least by the applause of their fellows, by the dignity, if  not by the more solid recompenses, of learning. Indeed as civilisation  progresses the enquiry into causes tends to absorb more and more of the  highest intellectual energies of a people; and an ever greater number of  men, renouncing the bustle, the pleasures, and the ambitions of an  active life, devote themselves exclusively to the pursuit of abstract  truth; they set themselves to discover the causes of things, to trace  the regularity and order that may be supposed to underlie the seemingly  irregular, confused, and arbitrary sequence of phenomena. Unquestionably  the progress of civilisation owes much to the sustained efforts of such  men, and if of late years and within our own memory the pace of progress  has sensibly quickened, we shall perhaps not err in supposing that some  part at least of the acceleration may be accounted for by an increase in  the number of lifelong students.    [Sidenote: The idea of cause is simply that of invariable sequence  suggested by the observation of many particular cases of sequence.]    Now when we analyse the conception of a cause to the bottom, we find as  the last residuum in our crucible nothing but what Hume found "]]]
