On his forehead,  attached to the band which keeps the mantle in place, projects a  leathern case, square in form; another similar case is tied by  a thong to the left arm; the borders of his robe are decorated  with deep fringe; and by such signs--the phylacteries, the enlarged  borders of the garment, and the savor of intense holiness pervading  the whole man--we know him to be a Pharisee, one of an organization  (in religion a sect, in politics a party) whose bigotry and power  will shortly bring the world to grief.    The densest of the throng outside the gate covers the road leading  off to Joppa. Turning from the Pharisee, we are attracted by some  parties who, as subjects of study, opportunely separate themselves from  the motley crowd. First among them a man of very noble appearance--clear,  healthful complexion; bright black eyes; beard long and flowing, and rich  with unguents; apparel well-fitting, costly, and suitable for the season.  He carries a staff, and wears, suspended by a cord from his neck, a large  golden seal. Several servants attend him, some of them with short swords  stuck through their sashes; when they address him, it is with the  utmost deference. The rest of the party consists of two Arabs of  the pure desert stock; thin, wiry men, deeply bronzed, and with  hollow cheeks, and eyes of almost evil brightness; on their heads  red tarbooshes; over their abas, and wrapping the left shoulder  and the body so as to leave the right arm free, brown woollen  haicks, or blankets. There is loud chaffering, for the Arabs are  leading horses and trying to sell them; and, in their eagerness,  they speak in high, shrill voices. The courtly person leaves the  talking mostly to his servants; occasionally he answers with  much dignity; directly, seeing the Cypriote, he stops and buys  some figs. And when the whole party has passed the portal, close  after the Pharisee, if we betake ourselves to the dealer in fruits,  he will tell, with a wonderful salaam, that the stranger is a Jew,  one of the princes of the city, who has travelled, and learned the  difference between the common grapes of Syria and those of Cyprus,  so surpassingly rich with the dews of the sea.    And so, till towards noon, sometimes later, the steady currents of  business habitually flow in and out of the Joppa Gate, carrying with  them every variety of character; including representatives of all  the tribes of Israel, all the sects among whom the ancient faith  has been parcelled and refined away, all the religious and social  divisions, all the adventurous rabble who, as children of art and  ministers of pleasure, riot in the prodigalities of Herod, and all  the peoples of note at any time compassed by the Caesars and their  predecessors, especially those dwelling within the circuit of the  Mediterranean.    In other words, Jerusalem, rich in sacred history, richer in  connection with sacred prophecies--the Jerusalem of Solomon,  in which silver was as stones, and cedars as the sycamores of  the vale--had come to be but a copy of Rome, a center of unholy  practises, a seat of pagan power. A Jewish king one day put on  priestly garments, and went into the Holy of Holies of the first  temple to offer incense, and he came out a leper; but in the time  of which we are reading, Pompey entered Herod's temple and the  same Holy of Holies, and came out without harm, finding but an  empty chamber, and of God not a sign.          CHAPTER VIII      The reader is now besought to return to the court described as  part of the market at the Joppa Gate. It was the third hour of the  day, and many of the people had gone away; yet the press continued  without apparent abatement. Of the new-comers, there was a group  over by the south wall, consisting of a man, a woman, and a donkey,  which requires extended notice.    The man stood by the animal's head, holding a leading-strap,  and leaning upon a stick which seemed to have been chosen for  the double purpose of goad and staff. His dress was like that of  the ordinary Jews around him, except that it had an appearance  of newness. The mantle dropping from his head, and the robe or  frock which clothed his person from neck to heel, were probably  the garments he was accustomed to wear to the synagogue on  Sabbath days. His features were exposed, and they told of fifty  years of life, a surmise confirmed by the gray that streaked his  otherwise black beard. He looked around him with the half-curious,  half-vacant stare of a stranger and provincial.    The donkey ate leisurely from an armful of green grass, of which  there was an abundance in the market. In its sleepy content,  the brute did not admit of disturbance from the bustle and  clamor about; no more was it mindful of the woman sitting upon  its back in a cushioned pillion. An outer robe of dull woollen  stuff completely covered her person, while a white wimple veiled  her head and neck. Once in a while, impelled by curiosity to see  or hear something passing, she drew the wimple aside, but so  slightly that the face remained invisible.    At length the man was accosted.    \"Are you not Joseph of Nazareth?\"    The speaker was standing close by.    \"I am so called,\" answered Joseph, turning gravely around; \"And  you--ah, peace be unto you! my friend, Rabbi Samuel!\"    \"The same give I back to you.\" The Rabbi paused, looking at  the woman, then added, \"To you, and unto your house and all  your helpers, be peace.\"    With the last word, he placed one hand upon his breast, and inclined  his head to the woman, who, to see him, had by this time withdrawn  the wimple enough to show the face of one but a short time out of  girlhood. Thereupon the acquaintances grasped right hands, as if to  carry them to their lips; at the last moment, however, the clasp  was let go, and each kissed his own hand, then put its palm upon  his forehead.    \"There is so little dust upon your garments,\" the Rabbi said,  familiarly, \"that I infer you passed the night in this city of  our fathers.\"    \"No,\" Joseph replied, \"as we could only make Bethany before the  night came, we stayed in the khan there, and took the road again  at daybreak.\"    \"The journey before you is long, then--not to Joppa, I hope.\"    \"Only to Bethlehem.\"    The countenance of the Rabbi, theretofore open and friendly,  became lowering and sinister, and he cleared his throat with  a growl instead of a cough.    \"Yes, yes--I see,\" he said. \"You were born in Bethlehem, and wend  thither now, with your daughter, to be counted for taxation,  as ordered by Caesar. The children of Jacob are as the tribes in  Egypt were--only they have neither a Moses nor a Joshua. How are  the mighty fallen!\"    Joseph answered, without change of posture or countenance,    \"The woman is not my daughter.\"    But the Rabbi clung to the political idea; and he went on,  without noticing the explanation, \"What are the Zealots doing  down in Galilee?\"    \"I am a carpenter, and Nazareth is a village,\" said Joseph,  cautiously. \"The street on which my bench stands is not a road  leading to any city. Hewing wood and sawing plank leave me no  time to take part in the disputes of parties.\"    \"But you are a Jew,\" said the Rabbi, earnestly. \"You are a Jew,  and of the line of David. It is not possible you can find pleasure  in the payment of any tax except the shekel given by ancient custom  to Jehovah.\"    Joseph held his peace.    \"I do not complain,\" his friend continued, \"of the amount of the  tax--a denarius is a trifle. Oh no! The imposition of the tax is  the offense. And, besides, what is paying it but submission to  tyranny? Tell me, is it true that Judas claims to be the Messiah?  You live in the midst of his followers.\"    \"I have heard his followers say he was the Messiah,\" Joseph replied.    At this point the wimple was drawn aside, and for an instant the  whole face of the woman was exposed. The eyes of the Rabbi wandered  that way, and he had time to see a countenance of rare beauty,  kindled by a look of intense interest; then a blush overspread  her cheeks and brow, and the veil was returned to its place.    The politician forgot his subject.    \"Your daughter is comely,\" he said, speaking lower.    \"She is not my daughter,\" Joseph repeated.    The curiosity of the Rabbi was aroused; seeing which, the Nazarene  hastened to say further, \"She is the child of Joachim and Anna of  Bethlehem, of whom you have at least heard, for they were of great  repute--\"    \"Yes,\" remarked the Rabbi, deferentially, \"I know them. They were  lineally descended from David. I knew them well.\"    \"Well, they are dead now,\" the Nazarene proceeded. \"They died in  Nazareth. Joachim was not rich, yet he left a house and garden  to be divided between his daughters Marian and Mary. This is one  of them; and to save her portion of the property, the law required  her to marry her next of kin. She is now my wife.\"    \"And you were--\"    \"Her uncle.\"    \"Yes, yes! And as you were both born in Bethlehem, the Roman compels  you to take her there with you to be also counted.\"    The Rabbi clasped his hands, and looked indignantly to heaven,  exclaiming, \"The God of Israel still lives! The vengeance is his!\"    With that he turned and abruptly departed. A stranger near by,  observing Joseph's amazement, said, quietly, \"Rabbi Samuel is  a zealot. Judas himself is not more fierce.\"    Joseph, not wishing to talk with the man, appeared not to hear,  and busied himself gathering in a little heap the grass which  the donkey had tossed abroad; after which he leaned upon his  staff again, and waited.    In another hour the party passed out the gate, and, turning to the  left, took the road into Bethlehem. The descent into the valley of  Hinnom was quite broken, garnished here and there with straggling  wild olive-trees. Carefully, tenderly, the Nazarene walked by the  woman's side, leading-s"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#8)"],[1,"of the neck, and though the dog growled  threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old  dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.  Francois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced  Sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.    Francois was angry. \"Now, by Gar, I feex you!\" he cried, coming back  with a heavy club in his hand.    Buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor  did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought  forward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with  bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to  dodge it if thrown by Francois, for he was become wise in the way of  clubs. The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he was  ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated two  or three steps. Francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.  After some time of this, Francois threw down the club, thinking that  Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He wanted, not to  escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was his by right. He  had earned it, and he would not be content with less.    Perrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better  part of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him,  and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after  him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and drop  of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of  their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around and around  the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would  come in and be good.    Francois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch  and swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an  hour gone. Francois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned  sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they  were beaten. Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called  to Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. Francois  unfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him back in his old place. The team  stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the trail.  There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more Francois  called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.    \"T'row down de club,\" Perrault commanded.    Francois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,  and swung around into position at the head of the team. His traces were  fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out  on to the river trail.    Highly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he  found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound  Buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,  and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior even  of Spitz, of whom Francois had never seen an equal.    But it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that  Buck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.  It was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil  mightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they  did not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for all  they cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team, however, had  grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their surprise was great  now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.    Pike, who pulled at Buck's heels, and who never put an ounce more of his  weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was swiftly  and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he was  pulling more than ever before in his life. The first night in camp,  Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly--a thing that Spitz had never  succeeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior  weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for  mercy.    The general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its  old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the  traces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were  added; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away  Francois's breath.    \"Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!\" he cried. \"No, nevaire! Heem worth one  t'ousan' dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?\"    And Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day  by day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and  there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too cold.  The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole  trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump,  with but infrequent stoppages.    The Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they  covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In  one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to  the White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy miles  of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run  towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night of the  second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope with  the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.    It was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty  miles. For three days Perrault and Francois threw chests up and down the  main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while  the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters  and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out  the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public  interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders. Francois  called Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. And that  was the last of Francois and Perrault. Like other men, they passed out  of Buck's life for good.    A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company  with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to  Dawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil  each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,  carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow  of the Pole.    Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in  it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,  whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a  monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was  very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,  fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,  others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before  the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.  Some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the  beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the  dogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it  was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so  with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were  fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought  Buck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got  out of his way.    Best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched  under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes  blinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller's  big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement  swimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the Japanese  pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of  Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had eaten or  would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very dim and  distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more potent were  the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before  a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of  his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still  later, in him, quickened and become alive again.    Sometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it  seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched  by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed  cook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,  with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and  swelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head slanted  back under it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and seemed very  much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered continually, clutching  in his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a  heavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but naked, a ragged and  fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back, but on his body there  was much hair. In some places, across the chest and shoulders and down  the outside of the arms and thighs, it was matted into almost a thick  fur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk inclined forward from  the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About his body there was  a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick  alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and  unseen.    At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between  his legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his  hands clasped above his head as though to shed"]]]
