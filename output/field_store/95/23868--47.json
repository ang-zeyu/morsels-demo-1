Soon we dug ourselves out  of sight.\"    \"But how do you dig--\"    \"Oh, just look at my bill, Phyllis.  With it I loosen the earth.  With  my feet I scratch the dirt out in a perfect shower behind me.  Our  tunnel is so narrow that we could not turn around in it.\"    \"How deep is it?\" asked the little girl, pushing back her big hat and  peering in.    The kingfisher did not seem to hear her.  He just went on with his  story.    \"Perhaps a little less than two feet from the outside we made a turn to  the right.  After that we were obliged to bring the earth out in our  beaks.    \"Two could not work at once.  While I worked at the tunnel Mrs.  Kingfisher fished.  While she worked, I fished.  At last the tunnel was  eight feet long.    \"'That is a very safe distance,' said Mrs. Kingfisher to me.  'Let us  dig no more, but make our nest here at the end of the tunnel.'    \"We built a wonderful nest,\" the bird went on, \"a fine prickly nest for  our little ones.  We did not line it with feathers and moss.  We  carefully arranged a pile of fish-bones and scales at the farthest end  of the tunnel.  On these bones and scales my wife laid six white eggs.  Already four little baby kingfishers have pecked their way out of the  white shells.  The others will be out soon.    \"I must be off about my fishing.  Mrs. Kingfisher and I will both be  very busy now catching minnows for those blue babies of ours.\"    With another chuckle and rattle the kingfisher flew away to his fishing  station over the pond.    Phyllis picked up her basket of berries and returned to the spot where  Jack still sat patiently holding his pole.    \"Oh, Jack--\" Phyllis began.    \"Sh-h-h-h!\" whispered Jack.   \"You promised not to talk.  You'll scare  the fish away.  Girls always talk.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said Phyllis.  \"How many have you now?\"    \"None--but I've had a nibble several times.  I think they'd bite better  if the sun would go under a cloud.\"    \"Let's eat our lunch now,\" begged Phyllis.  \"Perhaps there'll be some  clouds by the time we finish.\"    As they ate Phyllis told her brother about the kingfisher's nest and  babies.  When they finished the sky was as blue as ever.    \"These are halcyon days,\" said Jack, looking very wise.    \"Wh-a-a-t--?\" said Phyllis, wholly puzzled and half frightened at the  new word.    \"Well, you see father told me about them the other day when we were  fishing in this same place.    \"It seems that long ago when people were not very wise, they believed  all sorts of queer things.  They told strange stories about the things  which they did not understand.    \"In those days kingfishers were called halcyons.  Some said these birds  made nests which floated on the sea.    \"As long as these eggs or birdlings were in the nest, the people said,  the sea would remain smooth and the weather fair.    \"Ever since then, when we hear any one speak of 'halcyon days,' we know  that they mean pleasant happy days.\"    \"Then,\" laughed Phyllis, \"this has been one of the 'halcyon days' even  though you failed to catch any fish.\"    Then two tired little people trudged home through the river reeds and  down the lane.    On their way the blue kingfisher flashed by, chuckling harshly deep  down in his throat.          THE HALCYON BIRDS    That evening Phyllis opened a new book and on almost the first page she  saw something about the halcyon birds.    \"Perhaps it is Jack's story,\" she said.  Then she curled herself up on  the soft sofa and this is the story she read.    In the beautiful long ago, in the wonderful country of Greece there  lived a king, wise and just and peaceful.  His people loved him.    The king lived in a marble palace on the top of a low hill.  With him  lived his wife, the lovely Queen Halcyone.    But though the king was wise and just and good, his heart was sad.  There was unrest in the land.  Troubles were rife in Greece.    At length one day the king came to the room where Queen Halcyone sat  with her maids.  They were spinning carefully and happily together.    \"My Halcyone--my queen,\" said the king, \"as you know, I am greatly  troubled and disturbed.  I do not know what is the best thing for me to  do.  I must seek wise advice from the gods.\"    Queen Halcyone dropped her distaff and looked in fear at the king.    \"I must go,\" said the king to Halcyone, \"on a long journey across the  seas.  As you know, in the Temple of Apollo there is a wise oracle.  To  this oracle must I go in search of counsel.\"    Then the lovely Queen Halcyone's heart was filled with sorrow.  She  feared that harm might come to the king, whom she loved for his  goodness and his kindness.    Halcyone fell on her knees before the king.  She begged him to postpone  this terrible journey across the seas.    \"Indeed,\" cried she, \"there are cruel dangers, O my king!  The journey  is long and wearisome.  Remain at home with me!\"    The king smiled pityingly upon his lovely queen.  He kissed her gently  before he answered.    \"It seems to me,\" he said, sadly, \"that there is no other way.  I must  go.\"    \"Ah, then, I pray, take me also.  Let me share the dangers and the  weariness.\"    \"You could not--\" the king began.    \"In truth it would be easier far than to bear the loneliness and dread  when you are gone.  It would be weary waiting for your return!\"    Now the king loved Halcyone.  He longed to remain at home with her.  But already the boat lay ready for departure--and there was no place  for Halcyone.    Already the oarsmen sat at their benches ready to row away.  So the  king bade Halcyone farewell and stepped on board and quickly pushed off.    With bitter tears Halcyone stood on the bank and watched the king's  boat push out from shore.    When it looked but a speck she shaded her eyes with her hand and still  watched.  But when in the purple distance the tiny speck could no  longer be seen, Halcyone turned with a sigh to the marble palace and  her maidens.    On and on across the waters the little boat sped.  For a time all went  well.  At night the stars shone.  In the morning the sun arose from the  blue waters and travelled across a cloudless sky.  Gentle winds blew,  filling the sails and pushing the little boat quietly on its way.    But one day a change came over the sea.  The moaning of the wind was  heard.  Dark clouds scurried across the sky.    The waves rose high and broke in white crests of foam.  The rain poured  down.  The wind crept up and sprang upon the little boat with fury.    For a time the boat rose and fell with the waves.  It pitched and  rolled and reeled.  Great waves splashed over it, washing the oarsmen  overboard.    The masts were torn away.  At last the little boat, buried in the  trough of the wave, sank beneath the water.    The king and all his crew lay buried deep beneath the deep blue sea.    Weeks passed.  Months passed.  A year went by.    Queen Halcyone wandered restlessly up and down the shore.  With weary  eyes she watched the purple distance.  But the king did not return.    She prayed to the gods that they would guard and protect the king whom  she loved so dearly.  She went to the sacred altars of her country, and  burned incense there.    When the goddess Juno heard the prayers and saw the tears of the lovely  Queen Halcyone, she was sad for her.  Juno called to her side the  beautiful rainbow messenger, Iris.    \"Iris,\" said Juno, \"this night I wish you to go down on your rainbow  bridge to the god of dreams.    \"Ask him to send to Halcyone a dream which shall tell her of the fate  of her husband, the king.  It is better that she should know what has  befallen him whom she loved than to wander thus in uncertainty.\"    So Iris, the beautiful messenger, swept down to the god of dreams--and  that night Halcyone dreamed that the king came to her and told her his  story.  He told her how the boat and all therein had long since been  buried under the sea.    \"Be brave, my Halcyone,\" said the shade of the dead king.  \"Be brave  and patient, and soon perchance, if the gods will, thou shalt come to  me in the land of shades.\"    When the dream left her, Halcyone sprang from her couch and ran again  to the seashore.  She stretched out her arms and called aloud to  Aeolus, the father of the winds.    \"O great father Aeolus,\" she prayed, \"give me wings so large and strong  that they will carry me to the spot where the king now lies.    \"Hear me, Aeolus!  Hear Halcyone, thy child!\"    And as she prayed, lo, she rose slowly into the air.  The folds of her  blue robe enwrapped her.    Halcyone floated out across the sea.  Again and again her breast  touched the white crest of the waves and left its foam on her throat  and on the bosom of her dress.    On and on she sped across the billowy waters.  Her wings were firm,  strong, untiring.    At last, floating upon the water she spied the form of the king.  With  a hoarse rattling in her throat she called to him.    With her strong wings outspread, Halcyone hung motionless above the  king.  Those broken cries came again and again from her throat.    And Juno, looking down from her cloudland home, saw Halcyone kneeling  on the waves beside the dead king.  She leaned down from her place in  the heavens and touched the king's forehead.    Lo! there rose from the water two strong-winged birds in dresses of  blue and white.    \"Ah,\" sighed Aeolus, \"let us call them the halcyon birds, for the  lovely Halcyone, whose love did not fail her.    \"Let these birds live ever beside the waters and rear their young in  peace and quiet.    \"Behold, when Halcyone broods over her little ones I will hold my winds  in check.  The waters shall be quiet and the sun shall shine merrily.    \"And these days of peace and quiet and happiness shall be called  'halcyon days,' for ever.\"          ALL ABOUT THE KINGFISHER    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Comes north in early March--remains until December, often throughout  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1," the first peep of dawn to-morrow.\"    The next day they prepared themselves just as they did when they  expected to meet the Woodpecker fairy, and set out. Soon they heard a  howling and rustling unlike any thing ever known before.    \"Make ready, master, the Scorpion Witch is coming.\"    The Scorpion Witch, with one jaw in the sky and the other on the  earth, approached like the wind, spitting fire as she came, but the  horse darted upward as swiftly as an arrow, and then rushed over her a  little on one side. The hero shot an arrow and one of her heads fell,  but when he was going to strike off another, the Scorpion Witch  entreated him to forgive her, she would do him no harm, and to  convince him of this she gave him her promise, written in her own  blood.    Like the Woodpecker Fairy, she entertained the prince, who returned  her head, which grew on again, and at the end of three days he resumed  his travels.    When the hero and his horse had reached the boundaries of the Scorpion  Witch's kingdom they hurried on without resting till they came to a  field covered with flowers, where reigned perpetual spring. Every  blossom was remarkably beautiful and filled with a sweet, intoxicating  fragrance; a gentle breeze fanned them all. They remained here to  rest, but the horse said:    \"We have arrived so far successfully, master, but we still have one  great peril to undergo and, if the Lord helps us to conquer it, we  shall really be valiant heroes. A short distance further on is the  palace where dwell Youth without Age and Life without Death. It is  surrounded by a high, dense forest, where roam all the wild animals in  the world, watching it day and night. They are very numerous, and it  is almost beyond the bounds of possibility to get through the wood by  fighting them; we must try, if we can, to jump over them.\"    After resting about two days they prepared to continue their journey,  and the horse, holding its breath, said:    \"Buckle my girth as tight as you can, and when you have mounted hold  fast to my mane and press your feet close to my neck, that you may not  hinder me.\" The prince mounted, and in a moment they were close to the  forest.    \"Master,\" said the horse, \"this is the time that the wild beasts are  fed; they are all collected together, now we'll jump over.\"    \"Forward,\" replied the handsome prince, \"and may the Lord have mercy  on us.\"    They flew upward and saw the palace, which glittered so that it would  have been easier to look at the sun. They passed over the forest, and,  just as they were descending at the palace steps, one of the horse's  hoofs lightly touched the top of a tree, which put the whole woods in  motion. The wild animals began to howl till it was enough to make  one's hair bristle. They hastily alighted, and if the mistress of the  palace had not been outside feeding her chickens (for that is what she  called the wild beasts), they would certainly have been killed. She  spared their lives out of pure pleasure, for she had never before seen  a human being. Restraining the savage beasts, she soothed them, and  sent them back to their haunts. She was a tall, slender, lovely  fairy, quite too beautiful. When the young hero saw her, he stood  still as though turned to stone. But as she gazed at him she pitied  him and said:    \"Welcome, my handsome prince. What do you seek here?\"    \"We seek Youth without Age and Life without Death.\"    Then he dismounted from his horse and entered the palace, where he  found two other ladies, both of the same age, the elder sisters of the  first one. He began to thank the fairy for having delivered him from  danger, but she and her sisters, to show their joy, had a handsome  banquet served in golden dishes. They gave the horse liberty to graze  wherever it chose, and afterward made it acquainted with all the wild  beasts, so that it might rove about the forest in peace. The ladies  entreated the prince to stay with them, saying that it was so tiresome  to be alone. He did not wait to be asked a second time, but accepted  the offer with the satisfaction of a man who has found precisely what  he sought.    By degrees they became accustomed to live together; the prince told  them his story and related what he had suffered before meeting them,  and after some time he married the youngest sister. At their wedding  permission was granted to him to go wherever he liked in the  neighborhood; they only begged him not to enter one valley, which they  pointed out, otherwise some misfortune would befall him; it was  called, they said, the Valley of Lamentation.    The prince spent a very long time at the palace without being aware  of it, for he always remained just as young as he was when he arrived.  He wandered about the woods without ever having a headache. He amused  himself in the golden palace, lived in peace and quiet with his wife  and her sisters, enjoyed the beauty of the flowers, and the sweet,  pure air. He often went hunting; but one day, while pursuing a hare,  he shot two arrows at it without hitting the animal. Angrily chasing  it he discharged a third arrow, which struck it, but in his haste the  luckless man had not noticed that he had passed through the Valley of  Lamentation while following the game.    He picked it up and turned toward home, but was suddenly seized with a  longing for his father and mother. He did not venture to speak of this  wish to his wife, yet by his grief and restlessness both she and her  sisters instantly perceived his condition.    \"Oh! luckless prince, you have passed through the Valley of  Lamentation,\" they said in terror.    \"I did so, my dear ones, without meaning to be so imprudent, but now  the longing to see my parents is killing me! Yet I can not forsake  you. I have already spent several days with you and have no cause to  complain. So I'll go and see my parents once more, and then come back  to you, never to leave you again.\"    \"Do not quit us, beloved prince! Your parents died two or three  hundred years ago, and if you go, we fear you yourself will never  return; stay with us, for a presentiment of evil tells us that you  will perish!\"    All the entreaties of the three ladies, as well as those of the horse,  were unable to quiet the young hero's longing for his parents, which  was fairly consuming him alive.    At last the horse said: \"If you don't listen to me, master, whatever  happens to you will be your own fault. I'll tell you something, and if  you accept my condition, I'll take you back.\"    \"I'll accept it with many thanks,\" replied the prince; \"let me hear  it.\"    \"As soon as you reach your father's palace you will dismount, but I am  to return alone in case you stay even an hour.\"    \"Be it so,\" the prince agreed.    They made their preparations for the journey, the prince embraced the  ladies and after having bade them farewell he rode away, but they  sobbed and wept bitterly when he left them.    They reached the country which had once been the kingdom of the  Scorpion Witch, but found cities there; the woods had become fields;  the prince questioned one person and another about the Scorpion Witch  and her house, but they answered that their grandfathers had heard  from their great, great grandfathers that such silly tales had once  been told.    \"How is that possible!\" replied the prince, \"I came through this  region myself only a short time ago,\" and he told them all he knew.    The people laughed at him as if he were a lunatic or a person talking  in his sleep, and the prince angrily rode on without noticing that his  hair and beard were growing white.    When he reached the realm of the Woodpecker Fairy, the same questions  and answers were exchanged. The prince could not understand how these  places had altered so much in a few days, and again rode angrily on.  He now had a white beard that reached to his waist, and he felt as if  his feet were beginning to tremble.    Quitting this country he arrived in his father's empire. Here he found  new people, new towns, and every thing so much changed that he could  not recognize it. At last he came to the palace where he was born.  When he dismounted, the horse kissed his hand, and said:    \"I wish you good health, master, I'm going back to the place from  which I came. If you want to go too, mount quickly, and we'll be off.\"    \"Farewell, I too hope to return soon.\"    The horse darted away with the speed of an arrow.    When the prince saw the ruined palace and the weeds growing around it,  he sighed deeply and with tears in his eyes tried to remember how  magnificent these places had once been. He walked around the building  two or three times, tried to recollect how every room, every corner  had looked, found the stable where he had discovered the horse, and  then went down into the cellar, whose entrance was choked up with  fallen rubbish.    He groped hither and thither, holding up his eyelids with his hands,  and scarcely able to totter along, while his snowy beard now fell to  his knees, but found nothing except a dilapidated old chest, which he  opened. It seemed empty, but as he raised the lid a voice from the  bottom said: \"Welcome, if you had kept me waiting much longer, I too  should have gone to decay.\"    Then his death, which had become completely shriveled in the chest,  seized him; but the prince fell lifeless on the ground and instantly  crumbled into dust.        Into the saddle then I sprung,      The tale to tell to old and young.          The Little Purse with two Half-pennies.      There was once an old man and an old woman. The old woman had a hen  and the old man had a rooster; the old woman's hen laid two eggs a day  and she ate a great many, but she would not give the old man a single  one. One day the old man lost patience and said: \"Listen, old crony,  you live as if you were in clover, give me a couple of eggs so that I  can at least have a taste of them.\"    \"No indeed!\" replied the old"]]]
