We  came at length to the foot of a tower.        CANTO VIII. The Fifth Circle.--Phlegyas and his boat.--Passage of  the Styx.--Filippo Argenti.--The City of Dis.--The demons refuse  entrance to the poets.    I say, continuing, that, long before we were at the foot of the  high tower, our eyes went upward to its top because of two  flamelets that we saw set there, and another giving signal back  from so far that hardly could the eye reach it. And I turned me  to the Sea of all wisdom; I said, \"This one, what says it? and  what answers that other fire? and who are they that make it?\" And  he to me, \"Upon the foul waves already thou mayest discern that  which is expected, if the fume of the marsh hide it not from  thee.\"    Bowstring never sped arrow from itself that ran so swift a course  through the air, as a very little boat which I saw coming through  the water toward us at that instant, under the direction of a  single ferryman, who was crying out, \"Art thou then come, fell  soul?\"    \"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, this time thou criest out in vain,\" said my  Lord; \"longer thou shalt not have us than only while crossing the  slough.\" As one who listens to some great deceit that has been  practiced on him, and then chafes at it, such became Phlegyas in  his stifled anger.    My Leader descended into the bark and then he made me enter after  him, and only when I was in did it seem laden. Soon as my Leader  and I were in the boat, the antique prow goes its way, cutting  more of the water than it is wont with others.    While we were running through the dead channel, before me showed  himself one full of mud, and said, \"Who art thou that comest  before the hour?\" And I to him, \"If I come I stay not; but thou,  who art thou that art become so foul?\" He answered, \"Thou seest  that I am one who weeps.\" And I to him, \"With weeping and with  wailing, accursed spirit, do thou remain, for I know thee  although thou art all filthy.\" Then he stretched to the boat both  his hands, whereat the wary Master thrust him back, saying,  \"Begone there, with the other dogs!\" Then with his arms he  clasped my neck, kissed my face, and said, \"Disdainful soul,  blessed be she who bore thee! This one was an arrogant person in  the world; no goodness is there that adorns his memory; therefore  is his shade so furious here. How many now up there are held  great kings who shall stand here like swine in mire, leaving of  themselves horrible dispraises.\" And I, \"Master, I should much  like to see him ducked in this broth before we depart from the  lake.\" And he to me, \"Ere the shore allows thee to see it thou  shalt be satisfied; it will be fitting that thou enjoy such a  desire.\" After this a little I saw such rending of him by the  muddy folk that I still praise God therefor, and thank Him for  it. All cried, \"At Filippo Argenti!\" and the raging florentine  spirit turned upon himself with his teeth. Here we left him; so  that I tell no more of him.    But on my ears there smote a wailing, whereat forward intent I  open wide my eye. And the good Master said, \"Now, son, the city  draws near that is named Dis, with its heavy citizens, with its  great throng.\" And I, \"Master, already in the valley therewithin  I clearly discern its mosques vermillion, as if issuing from  fire.\" And he said to me, \"The eternal fire that blazes within  them displays them red as thou seest in this nether Hell.\"    We at last arrived within the deep ditches that encompass that  disconsolate city. The walls seemed to me to be of iron. Not  without first making a great circuit did we come to a place where  the ferryman loudly shouted to us, \"Out with you, here is the  entrance.\"    Upon the gates I saw more than a thousand of those rained down  from heaven who angrily were saying, \"Who is this, that without  death goes through the realm of the dead folk?\" And my wise  Master made a sign of wishing to speak secretly with them. Then  they shut in a little their great scorn, and said, \"Come thou  alone, and let him be gone who so boldly entered on this realm.  Alone let him return on the mad path: let him try if he can; for  thou, who hast escorted him through so dark a region, shalt  remain here.\"    Think, Reader, if I was discomforted at the sound of the accursed  words, for I did not believe ever to return hither.[1]    [1] To this world.      \"O my dear Leader, who more than seven times hast renewed  assurance in me, and drawn me from deep peril that stood  confronting me, leave me not,\" said I, \"thus undone; and, if the  going farther onward be denied us, let us together retrace our  footprints quickly.\" And that Lord who had led me thither said to  me, \"Fear not, for no one can take from us our onward way, by  Such an one it is given to us. But here await me, and comfort thy  dejected spirit and feed on good hope, for I will not leave thee  in the nether world.\"    So the sweet Father goes away, and here abandons me, and I remain  in suspense; and yes and no contend within my head. I could not  hear what he set forth to them, but he had not staid there long  with them, when each ran vying back within. These our adversaries  closed the gates on the breast of my Lord, who remained without,  and returned to me with slow steps. He held his eyes upon the  ground, and his brow was shorn of all hardihood, and he said in  sighs, \"Who hath denied to me the houses of woe?\" And he said to  me, \"Thou, because I am wroth, be not dismayed, for I shall win  the strife, whoever circle round within for the defence. This  their insolence is not new, for of old they used it at a less  secret gate, which still is found without a bolt. Above it thou  didst see the dead inscription; and already on this side of it  descends the steep, passing without escort through the circles,  One such that by him the city shall be opened to us.\"        CANTO IX. The City of Dis.--Erichtho.--The Three Furies.--The  Heavenly Messenger.--The Sixth Circle, that of the Heresiarchs.    That color which cowardice painted outwardly on me when I saw my  Guide turn back, repressed more speedily his own new color. He  stopped attentive, like a man that listens, for the eye could not  lead him far through the black air, and through the dense fog.    \"Yet it must be for us to win the fight,\" began he, \"unless--Such  an one offered herself to us.[1] Oh how slow it seems till Some  one here arrive!\"[2]    [1] Beatrice.    [2] The messenger from Heaven, referred to in the last verses of  the last canto.      I saw well how he covered up the beginning with the rest that  came after, which were words different from the first. But  nevertheless his speech gave me fear, because I drew his broken  phrase perchance to a worse meaning than it held.    \"Into this depth of the dismal shell does any one ever descend  from the first grade who has for penalty only hope cut off?\"[1]  This question I put, and he answered me, \"Seldom it happens that  any one of us maketh the journey on which I am going. It is true  that another time I was conjured down here by that cruel Erichtho  who was wont to call back shades into their bodies. Short while  had my flesh been bare of me, when she made me enter within that  wall in order to drag out for her a spirit from the circle of  Judas. That is the lowest place, and the darkest, and the  farthest from the Heaven that encircles all. Well do I know the  road: therefore assure thyself. This marsh which breathes out the  great stench girds round about the woeful city wherein now we  cannot enter without anger.\"    [1] Dante asks for assurance that Virgil, whose station is in  Limbo, \"the first grade,\" knows the way.      And more he said, but I hold it not in mind because my eye had  wholly attracted me toward the high tower with the ruddy summit,  where in an instant were uprisen suddenly three infernal furies,  stained with blood, who had the limbs of women and their action,  and were girt with greenest hydras. Little serpents and cerastes  they had for hair, wherewith their savage brows were bound.    And he, who well knew the handmaids of the queen of the eternal  lamentation, said to me, \"Behold the fell Erinnyes; this is  Megaera on the left side, she who weeps on the right is Alecto,  Tisiphone is in the middle,\" and therewith he was silent.    With her nails each was tearing her breast, they beat themselves  with their hands, and cried out so loud that I pressed close to  the Poet through dread. \"Let Medusa come, so we will make him of  stone,\" they all said, looking down. \"Ill was it we avenged not  on Theseus his assault.\"    \"Turn thy back, and keep thy sight closed, for if the Gorgon show  herself, and thou shouldest see her, no return upward would there  ever be.\" Thus said the Master, and he himself turned me, and did  not so trust to my hands that with his own he did not also  blindfold me.    O ye who have sound understanding, regard the doctrine that is  hidden under the veil of the strange verses.    And already was coming across the turbid waves a tumult of a  sound full of terror at which both the shores trembled. Not  otherwise it was than of a wind, impetuous through the opposing  heats, that strikes the forest, and without any stay shatters the  branches, beats down and carries them away; forward, laden with  dust, it goes superb, and makes the wild beasts and the shepherds  fly.    My eyes he loosed, and said, \"Now direct the nerve of sight  across the ancient scum, there yonder where that fume is most  bitter.\"    As frogs before the hostile snake all scatter through the water,  till each huddles on the ground, I saw more than a thousand  destroyed souls flying thus before one, who at the ford was  passing over the Styx with dry feet.

Therefore if there is anything in Christ composed of the two natures,  it follows that this will not be a person but a nature; and hence the  union in Christ will take place in the nature, which is contrary to  A. 2.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3, 4, 5), \"In  the Lord Jesus Christ we acknowledge two natures, but one hypostasis  composed from both.\"    _I answer that,_ The Person or hypostasis of Christ may be viewed in  two ways. First as it is in itself, and thus it is altogether simple,  even as the Nature of the Word. Secondly, in the aspect of person or  hypostasis to which it belongs to subsist in a nature; and thus the  Person of Christ subsists in two natures. Hence though there is one  subsisting being in Him, yet there are different aspects of  subsistence, and hence He is said to be a composite person, insomuch  as one being subsists in two.    And thereby the solution to the first is clear.    Reply Obj. 2: This composition of a person from natures is not  so called on account of parts, but by reason of number, even as that  in which two things concur may be said to be composed of them.    Reply Obj. 3: It is not verified in every composition, that  the thing composed is homogeneous with its component parts, but only  in the parts of a continuous thing; for the continuous is composed  solely of continuous [parts]. But an animal is composed of soul and  body, and neither of these is an animal.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 5]    Whether in Christ There Is Any Union of Soul and Body?    Objection 1: It would seem that in Christ there was no union of soul  and body. For from the union of soul and body in us a person or a  human hypostasis is caused. Hence if the soul and body were united in  Christ, it follows that a hypostasis resulted from their union. But  this was not the hypostasis of God the Word, for It is eternal.  Therefore in Christ there would be a person or hypostasis besides the  hypostasis of the Word, which is contrary to AA. 2, 3.    Obj. 2: Further, from the union of soul and body results the nature  of the human species. But Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3), that  \"we must not conceive a common species in the Lord Jesus Christ.\"  Therefore there was no union of soul and body in Him.    Obj. 3: Further, the soul is united to the body for the sole purpose  of quickening it. But the body of Christ could be quickened by the  Word of God Himself, seeing He is the fount and principle of life.  Therefore in Christ there was no union of soul and body.    _On the contrary,_ The body is not said to be animated save from its  union with the soul. Now the body of Christ is said to be animated,  as the Church chants: \"Taking an animate body, He deigned to be born  of a Virgin\" [*Feast of the Circumcision, Ant. ii, Lauds]. Therefore  in Christ there was a union of soul and body.    _I answer that,_ Christ is called a man univocally with other men, as  being of the same species, according to the Apostle (Phil. 2:7),  \"being made in the likeness of a man.\" Now it belongs essentially to  the human species that the soul be united to the body, for the form  does not constitute the species, except inasmuch as it becomes the  act of matter, and this is the terminus of generation through which  nature intends the species. Hence it must be said that in Christ the  soul was united to the body; and the contrary is heretical, since it  destroys the truth of Christ's humanity.    Reply Obj. 1: This would seem to be the reason which was of weight  with such as denied the union of the soul and body in Christ, viz.  lest they should thereby be forced to admit a second person or  hypostasis in Christ, since they saw that the union of soul and body  in mere men resulted in a person. But this happens in mere men  because the soul and body are so united in them as to exist by  themselves. But in Christ they are united together, so as to be  united to something higher, which subsists in the nature composed of  them. And hence from the union of the soul and body in Christ a new  hypostasis or person does not result, but what is composed of them is  united to the already existing hypostasis or Person. Nor does it  therefore follow that the union of the soul and body in Christ is of  less effect than in us, for its union with something nobler does not  lessen but increases its virtue and worth; just as the sensitive soul  in animals constitutes the species, as being considered the ultimate  form, yet it does not do so in man, although it is of greater effect  and dignity, and this because of its union with a further and nobler  perfection, viz. the rational soul, as has been said above (A. 2, ad  2).    Reply Obj. 2: This saying of Damascene may be taken in two ways:  First, as referring to human nature, which, as it is in one  individual alone, has not the nature of a common species, but only  inasmuch as either it is abstracted from every individual, and  considered in itself by the mind, or according as it is in all  individuals. Now the Son of God did not assume human nature as it  exists in the pure thought of the intellect, since in this way He  would not have assumed human nature in reality, unless it be said  that human nature is a separate idea, just as the Platonists  conceived of man without matter. But in this way the Son of God would  not have assumed flesh, contrary to what is written (Luke 24:39), \"A  spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see Me to have.\" Neither can  it be said that the Son of God assumed human nature as it is in all  the individuals of the same species, otherwise He would have assumed  all men. Therefore it remains, as Damascene says further on (De Fide  Orth. iii, 11) that He assumed human nature _in atomo,_ i.e. in an  individual; not, indeed, in another individual which is a suppositum  or a person of that nature, but in the Person of the Son of God.    Secondly, this saying of Damascene may be taken not as referring to  human nature, as if from the union of soul and body one common nature  (viz. human) did not result, but as referring to the union of the two  natures Divine and human: which do not combine so as to form a third  something that becomes a common nature, for in this way it would  become predicable of many, and this is what he is aiming at, since he  adds: \"For there was not generated, neither will there ever be  generated, another Christ, Who from the Godhead and manhood, and in  the Godhead and manhood, is perfect God and perfect man.\"    Reply Obj. 3: There are two principles of corporeal life: one the  effective principle, and in this way the Word of God is the principle  of all life; the other, the formal principle of life, for since \"in  living things to be is to live,\" as the Philosopher says (De Anima  ii, 37), just as everything is formally by its form, so likewise the  body lives by the soul: in this way a body could not live by the  Word, Which cannot be the form of a body.  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 6]    Whether the Human Nature Was United to the Word of God Accidentally?    Objection 1: It would seem that the human nature was united to the  Word of God accidentally. For the Apostle says (Phil. 2:7) of the Son  of God, that He was \"in habit found as a man.\" But habit is  accidentally associated with that to which it pertains, whether habit  be taken for one of the ten predicaments or as a species of quality.  Therefore human nature is accidentally united to the Son of God.    Obj. 2: Further, whatever comes to a thing that is complete in being  comes to it accidentally, for an accident is said to be what can come  or go without the subject being corrupted. But human nature came to  Christ in time, Who had perfect being from eternity. Therefore it  came to Him accidentally.    Obj. 3: Further, whatever does not pertain to the nature or the  essence of a thing is its accident, for whatever is, is either a  substance or an accident. But human nature does not pertain to the  Divine Essence or Nature of the Son of God, for the union did not  take place in the nature, as was said above (A. 1). Hence the human  nature must have accrued accidentally to the Son of God.    Obj. 4: Further, an instrument accrues accidentally. But the human  nature was the instrument of the Godhead in Christ, for Damascene  says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15), that \"the flesh of Christ is the  instrument of the Godhead.\" Therefore it seems that the human nature  was united to the Son of God accidentally.    _On the contrary,_ Whatever is predicated accidentally, predicates,  not substance, but quantity, or quality, or some other mode of being.  If therefore the human nature accrues accidentally, when we say  Christ is man, we do not predicate substance, but quality or  quantity, or some other mode of being, which is contrary to the  Decretal of Pope Alexander III, who says (Conc. Later. iii): \"Since  Christ is perfect God and perfect man, what foolhardiness have some  to dare to affirm that Christ as man is not a substance?\"    _I answer that,_ In evidence of this question we must know that two  heresies have arisen with regard to the mystery of the union of the  two natures in Christ. The first confused the natures, as Eutyches  and Dioscorus, who held that from the two natures one nature  resulted, so that they confessed Christ to be \"from\" two natures  (which were distinct before the union), but not \"in\" two natures (the  distinction of nature coming to an end after the union). The second  was the heresy of Nestorius and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who separated  the persons. For they held the Person of the Son of God to be  distinct from the Person of the Son of man, and said these were  mutually united: first, \"by indwelling,\" inasmuch as the Word of God  dwelt in the man, as in a temple; secondly, \"by unity of intention,\"  inasmuch as the will of the man was always in agreement with the"]]]
