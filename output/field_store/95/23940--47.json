It would seem that the hedgehog is also externally insensible to  poison, for it fights with adders, and is bitten about the lips and nose  without receiving any injury. An experiment has been made by  administering prussic acid to it, which took no effect.    It is well known that hedgehogs are covered with bristles, amounting to  sharp prickles, and that they roll themselves up into a ball. This is  effected by a peculiar set of muscles attached to the skin, by which  they pull themselves into this shape, and at the same time set up every  bristle, and drag their head and limbs within. Such is the resistance  and elasticity of these bristles, that the owners of them may be thrown  to great distances and remain unhurt, and they will even throw  themselves down steep places when they wish to move from a particular  spot.    Hedgehogs are nocturnal animals, and frequent woods, gardens, orchards,  and thick hedge-rows. It is in the latter that I have heard of one being  mistaken by a hen for a bush, in which she might lay her egg in safety.  The fact was announced by the triumphant cackling which these birds  vociferate on such occasions: the egg was consequently searched for, and  found upon the hedgehog's back.    Hedgehogs feed on insects, slugs, frogs, eggs, young birds in the nest,  mice, fallen fruits, and the roots of vegetables, especially the  plantain, boring into the ground to get at these substances. They will  clear a house of black beetles in a few weeks, as I can attest from my  own experience. My kitchen was much infested, not only by them, but by a  sort of degenerated cockroach, descended from the better conditioned  Blattae, brought in my packages from a tropical country, and which had  resisted all efforts for their extermination, such as boiling water,  pepper, arsenic-wafers, mortar, etc. At last, a friend, whose house had  been cleared of beetles by a hedgehog, made the animal over to me, very  much to the discomfort of my cook, to whom it was an object of terror.  The first night of its arrival a bed was made for it in a hamper, half  full of hay, and a saucer of milk was set within. The next morning the  hedgehog had disappeared, and for several days the search made for it  was fruitless. That it was alive was proved by the milk being drunk out  of the saucer in which it was placed. One night I purposely went into  the kitchen after the family had been for some time in bed, and, as I  opened the door, I saw the little creature slink into a hole under the  oven attached to the grate. Fearing this would sometimes prove too hot  for it, I had some bricks put in to fill up the aperture. The next night  the bricks were pulled away, and overturned, evincing a degree of  strength which astonished us; but, after that, we left the animal to its  own care. The beetles and cockroaches visibly disappeared, but as they  disappeared other things also vanished; kitchen cloths left to dry at  night were missing; then, a silk handkerchief. At last a night-cap left  on the dresser was gone; and these abstractions were most mysterious.  The next day there was a general search in possible and impossible  places, and the end of a muslin string was seen in the oven-hole; it was  seized on, and not only was the night-cap dragged out, but all the  missing and not missing articles which the hedgehog had purloined; most  of them were much torn, and it was supposed that the poor beast had  taken possession of them to make a soft bed. I have not seen such a  propensity noticed elsewhere, and it may be a useful hint to those who  keep hedgehogs. All endeavours to make this animal friendly were  unavailing; but I am told, that hedgehogs are frequently quite  domesticated; and even shew a degree of affection.    Dr. Buckland ascertained the manner in which hedgehogs kill snakes; they  make a sudden attack on the reptile, give it a fierce bite, and then,  with the utmost dexterity, roll themselves up so as to present nothing  but spines when the snake retaliates. They repeat this manoeuvre several  times, till the back of the snake is broken in various places; they then  pass it through their jaws, cracking its bones at short intervals; after  which they eat it all up, beginning at the tail. The old legend, that  hedgehogs suck the udders of cows as they lie on the ground chewing the  cud is, of course, wholly without foundation. They retreat to holes in  trees, or in the earth where they make a bed of leaves, moss, etc., in  which they roll themselves, and these substances sticking to the spines  make them look like a bundle of vegetable matter. In this condition they  pass the winter, in a state of torpidity; but it should be mentioned,  that one which was tame, retained its activity the whole year. There are  instances of hedgehogs performing the office of turnspits in a kitchen;  and, from the facility with which they accommodate themselves to all  sorts of food, they are easily kept. They, however, when once accustomed  to animal diet, will attack young game; and one was detected in the  south of Scotland in the act of killing a leveret.          BEARS.      Among the Carnivora, or flesh-eating animals, Bears take the first  place; for their characters and habits link them in some degree with the  preceding order, the Insectivora. Both principally live on fruit,  grains, and insects, and only eat flesh from necessity, or some  peculiarity of life, such as confinement, or education.    The Carnivora are divided by naturalists into three tribes, the  characters for which are taken from their feet and manner of walking.  Bears rank among the Plantigrada, or those which put the whole of their  feet firmly upon the ground when they walk. They are occasionally  cunning and ferocious, but often evince good humour, and a great love of  fun. In their wild state they are solitary the greater part of their  lives; they climb trees with great facility, live in caverns, holes, and  hollow trees; and in cold countries, retire to some secluded spot during  the winter, where they remain concealed, and bring forth their young.  Some say they are torpid; but this cannot be, for the female bears come  from their retreats with cubs which have lived upon them, and it is not  likely, that they can have reared them and remained without food; they  are, however, often very lean and wasted, and the absorption of their  generally large portion of fat, contributes to their nourishment. The  story that they live by sucking their paws is, as may be supposed, a  fable; when well-fed they always lick their paws, very often  accompanying the action with a peculiar sort of mumbling noise. There  are a few which will never eat flesh, and all are able to do without it.  They are, generally speaking, large, clumsy and awkward, possessing  large claws for digging; and often walk on their hind-feet, a facility  afforded them by the peculiar formation of their thigh-bone. They do not  often attack in the first instance, unless impelled by hunger or danger;  they are, however, formidable opponents when excited. In former times  there were few parts of the globe in which they were not to be found;  but like other wild animals, they have disappeared before the advance of  man. Still they are found in certain spots from the northern regions of  the world, to the burning climes of Africa, Asia, and America. The  latest date of their appearance in Great Britain, was in Scotland,  during the year 1057.    Bears are always covered with thick fur; which, notwithstanding its  coarseness, is much prized for various purposes. They afford much sport  to those inclined for such exercises; but the cruel practice of  bear-baiting is discontinued. In an old edition of Hudibras, there is a  curious note of a mode of running at the devoted bears with  wheelbarrows, on which they vented their fury, and the baiters thus had  them at their mercy. At present the hunts are regularly organised  fights, or battles, besides which there are many ways of catching them  in traps, pitfalls, etc.    The large polar bear (Ursus Maritimus), with its white fur, its long,  flattened head, and black claws, may be seen in great perfection at the  Zoological Gardens. In its own country, during the winter, it lives  chiefly on seal's flesh, but in the summer eats berries, sea-weed, and  marsh plants. It is one of the most formidable of the race; and may be  seen climbing mountains of ice, and swimming from floe to floe with the  greatest rapidity. Captain Lyon tells us, that when a seal lies just  ashore, the bear gets quietly into the water and swims away from him to  leeward; he then takes short dives, and manages so that the last dive  shall bring him back close to the seal, which tries to escape by rolling  into the water, when he falls into the bear's paws; and if he should lie  still, the bear springs upon and devours him; its favourite food,  however, is the floating carcases of whales. The gait of all bears is a  sort of shuffle; but this one goes at such a rate, that its pace is  equal to a horse's gallop. It is remarkably sagacious, and often defeats  the stratagems practised for its capture. A female with two cubs was  pursued across a field of ice by a party of sailors; at first she urged  the young ones to increase their speed, by running in front of them,  turning round, and evincing, by gesture and voice, great anxiety for  their progress; but finding that their pursuers gained upon them, she  alternately carried, pushed, or pitched them forwards, until she  effected their escape. The cubs seemed to arrange themselves for the  throw, and when thus sent forwards some yards in advance, ran on till  she again came up to them, when they alternately placed themselves  before her.

To-morrow we will turn out with  the heaviest boots we have got instead of running shoes. When we can run  four miles in them, we ought to be able to keep up pretty fairly through  the hardest game of football.\"    There was a good deal of lagging behind towards the last part of the  run, a fact that Skinner pointed out triumphantly as a proof of want of  condition, but after a wash and change of clothes all the party agreed  that they felt better for the run.    Mr. River-Smith was as much concerned as the boys at the defeats of the  house at football, and when they sat down to breakfast the members of  the team found that a mutton-chop was provided for each of them. Strict  orders had been issued that nothing was to be said outside the house of  the football team going into training; and as, for the afternoon's  exercise, it was only necessary that every member of the team should  take part in football practice, and play up to the utmost, the matter  remained a secret. In the first two or three matches played the training  made no apparent difference.    \"You must not be disheartened at that,\" Mr. Cornish, who was the  \"housemaster,\" told them. \"Fellows always get weak when they first begin  to train. You will find the benefit presently.\"    And this was the case. They won the fourth match, which was against a  comparatively weak team. This, however, encouraged them, and they were  victorious in the next two contests, although in the second their  opponents were considered a strong team, and their victory had been  regarded as certain.    The improvement in the River-Smithites' team became a topic of  conversation in the college, and there were rumours that they had put  themselves into regular training, and that some one had seen them come  in in a body at seven in the morning after having been for a run. The  challenge cup matches were now at hand, and as it happened they were  drawn to meet the Greenites, and the match was regarded with special  interest throughout the school. The rivalry between the two houses was  notorious, and although the Greenites scoffed at the idea of their being  defeated by a team they had before so easily beaten, the great  improvement the latter had made gave promise that the struggle would be  an exceptionally severe one. Skinner had for some days before looked  after the team with extreme vigilance, scarcely letting one of them out  of his sight, lest they might eat forbidden things, or in other ways  transgress the rules laid down.    \"We may not win,\" he admitted, as they talked over the prospect on the  evening before the match, \"but at any rate they will have all their work  cut out to beat us. I know they are very confident, and of course their  weight is tremendously in their favour. Now, mind, we must press them as  hard as we can for the first half the game, and never leave them for a  single moment. They are sure to get savage when they find they have not  got it all their own way, and that will help to pump them. We shall have  more left in us the second half than they will, and then will be our  chance.\"    These tactics were followed out, and from the first the game was played  with exceptional spirit on both sides; and as the Greenites failed, even  by the most determined rushes, to carry the ball into their opponents'  goal, the game became, as Skinner had predicted, more and more savage.    The sympathies of the school were for the most part with River-Smith's,  and the loud shouts of applause and encouragement with which their  gallant defence of their goal was greeted, added to the irritation of  the Greenites. When the half-play was called neither party had scored a  point, and as they changed sides it was evident that the tremendous pace  had told upon both parties.    \"Now is our time,\" Skinner said to his team; \"they are more done than we  are, and our training will tell more and more every minute. Keep it up  hard, and when we see a chance make a big rush and carry it down to  their end.\"    But the Greenites were equally determined, and in spite of the efforts  of their opponents, kept the ball at their end of the field. Then  Skinner got it and made a rush. One of the heaviest of the Greenites  charged down upon them at full speed, but was encountered by Easton  before he reached him, and the two rolled over together. The  River-Smithites backed up their leader well, and he was more than  half-way down the ground before the Greenites had arrested his progress.  Then there was a close scrimmage, and for a time the mass swayed  backwards and forwards. But here weight counted for more than wind, and  the Greenites were pushing their opponents back when the ball rolled out  from the mass.    Edgar Clinton picked it up, and was off with it in a moment, dodging  through those who attempted to check his course. He was down near the  Greenites' goal before two of them threw themselves upon him together;  but his friends were close behind, and after a desperate scrimmage the  ball was driven behind the Greenite goal. Some loose play followed, and  a Greenite who had the ball threw it forward to one of his own team, who  caught it and started running. The River-Smithites shouted \"Dead ball!\"  \"Dead ball!\" and claimed the point; but the holder of the ball, without  heeding the shouts, ran right through followed by the rest of his team,  and touched down behind the River-Smith goal. The ball was then brought  out and a goal kicked. All this time the River-Smithites had not moved  from behind the Greenite goal, but had remained there awaiting the  result of their appeal to the umpire, who now at once decided in their  favour. Not satisfied with this the Greenites appealed to the referee,  who confirmed the decision of the umpire. Too angry to be reasonable,  the captain refused to continue the game, and called upon his team to  leave the field. They were going, when the derisive shouts of the  lookers-on caused them again to alter their intentions, and the game was  renewed.    There were ten minutes yet remaining, and for that time the game was  played with a fury that caused it to be long memorable in the annals of  Cheltenham football. But weight and strength could not prevail over the  superior last and coolness of the defenders of the River-Smith goal.  Every attempt was beaten off, every rush met, and as no point had been  added to the score when time was called, the umpire decided that the  game had been won by the River-Smithites by one touch down to nothing.  The captain of the Greenites appealed from the umpire's and referee's  decision to the football committee of the college, who gave it against  him, and he then appealed to the Rugby Union, who decided that the  umpire's decision was perfectly right, and the victory thus remained  beyond further contention with the River-Smithites.          CHAPTER III.    GONE.      \"Bravo, Clinton! Well done, indeed!\" so shouted one of the big boys, and  a score of others joined in in chorus.    \"Which is Clinton?\" a woman who was standing looking on at the game  asked one of the younger boys.    The boy looked up at the questioner. She was a woman of about forty  years old, quietly dressed in black with a gloss of newness on it.    \"I will point him out to you directly. They are all mixed up again now.\"    \"There are two of them, are there not?\" the woman asked.    \"Yes, that's the other; there--that one who has just picked up the ball  and is running with it; there, that's the other, the one who is just  charging the fellow who is trying to stop his brother.\"    \"Well done!\" he shouted, as Edgar's opponent rolled over.    The woman asked no more questions until the match was over, but stood  looking on intently as the players came off the ground. Rupert and Edgar  were together, laughing and talking in high spirits; for each had kicked  a goal, and the town boys had been beaten by four goals to one. The boy  to whom she had been speaking had long before strolled away to another  part of the field, but she turned to another as the Clintons approached.    \"Those are the Clintons, are they not?\" she asked.    \"Yes, and a good sort they are,\" the boy said heartily.    She stood looking at them intently until they had passed her, then  walked away with her eyes bent on the ground, and made her way to a  small lodging she had taken in the town. For several days she placed  herself so that she could see the boys on their way to and fro between  River-Smith's and the college, and watched them at football.    \"I wonder who that woman is,\" Rupert said one day to his brother. \"I  constantly see her about, and she always seems to be staring at me.\"    \"I thought she stared at me too,\" Edgar said. \"I am sure I do not know  her. I don't think I have ever seen her face before.\"    \"She asked me whether you were Clinton the other day when you were  playing football. It was just after you had made a run with the ball,  and some one shouted, 'Well done, Clinton!' And she asked me which was  Clinton, and whether there were not two of them. And of course I pointed  you both out,\" a youngster said who was walking with them.    \"That is rum, too,\" Rupert said. \"I wonder who the woman is, Edgar, and  what interest she can have in us.\"    \"If she has any interest, Rupert, I suppose she will stop staring some  day and speak. Perhaps it is some old servant, though I don't remember  her. Well, it is no odds any way.\"    Jane Humphreys was much puzzled as to what step she should take first.  During all these years she had waited she had always expected that she  should have known which was her own child as soon as she set eyes on the  boys, and was surprised and disappointed to find that even after a  week's stay at Cheltenham, and examining their faces as closely as she  could, she had not the slightest idea which was which. She had imagined  that she should not only know, but feel an affection for the boy who"]]]
