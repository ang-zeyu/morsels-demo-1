It was not a  very nourishing meal, but it was all he had, and soon after that he went  to sleep, trusting for better luck in the morning.    He was up almost before daybreak, and my young readers can rest assured  that by that time his appetite was decidedly keen. Listening intently,  he could hear the grouse drumming in the woods close by.    \"I must have some of them, and that directly,\" he told himself, and  rifle in hand lost no time in making his way to the woods. By keeping  out of sight behind the brushwood he managed to get quite close to the  game, and so brought down one after another until he had five. Such  success was a great satisfaction to him, and returning to the shack he  fixed himself a breakfast of broiled sharptails, to which he did full  justice.    It was not all play at the ranches, and sometimes Theodore Roosevelt  went out with his men to round up the cattle and help \"cut out\" what was  his own. This was hard work, for frequently the cattle did not want to  be separated from the beasts belonging to another ranchman. More than  once an angry cow or a bull would charge, and then there would be a  lively scramble on pony-back or on foot to get out of the way.  Sometimes, too, the cattle would wander off and get lost, and then a  long and hard hunt would be necessary in order to find them again.    But there was fun as well as hard work, and Mr. Roosevelt has told one  story about a skunk that is sure to be remembered. He says that skunks  were very numerous, and that they were more feared than larger animals  by the cowboys because the bite was sure to bring on hydrophobia.    One night a number of the cowboys and Mr. Roosevelt were sleeping in a  hut. A skunk came along, and after a time worked its way into the hut.  It got among the pots and pans and made a noise which quickly awoke a  Scotchman named Sandy.    Thinking something was wrong, Sandy struck a light, and seeing the eyes  of the skunk, fired. But his aim was bad, and the animal fled.    \"What were you firing at?\" asked half a dozen of the other cowboys.    The Scotchman explained, and, satisfied that it had been a skunk, the  others told him he had better leave the animal alone or there would be  trouble.    Nobody thought the skunk would come back, but it did, and again Sandy  heard it among the pots and pans. This was too much for his Scotch  blood, and taking aim once more, he fired and gave the skunk a mortal  wound. At once the hut was filled with a powerful odor that made all  the inmates rush for the open air.    \"Now see what you have done!\" cried several, indignantly.    \"Hoot mon!\" answered the Scotchman, holding his nose tightly, \"A didna  ken 'twould cause sec' a tragedee!\"    And after that we may be sure that Sandy let skunks severely alone.    Hunting in the summer time, or when the weather was but moderately cold,  was well enough, but hunting in the dead of winter was quite a different  thing. Then the thermometer would frequently drop to thirty and forty  degrees below zero, and there would be a cutting \"norther\" fit to freeze  the very marrow in one's bones. Seldom was there much snow, but when it  came, it caused a veritable blizzard, during which neither man nor beast  felt like stirring out.    It was during such weather that Theodore Roosevelt once had the tip of  his nose and one cheek frozen--something that caused him not a little  pain and trouble for a long time afterward.    It was in those dreary days that the logs were piled high in the broad  fireplace of the ranch home, and Theodore Roosevelt spent his days in  reading and studying, in writing letters to his friends and relatives,  and in penning some of the hunting sketches that have won him literary  fame.    One day, early in the winter, Theodore Roosevelt and his foreman went  out to see if they could not bring in two white-tail deer which had been  seen in the vicinity of the ranch the day before. One of the deer, a  large buck, had been shot in the ankle by the foreman, so the beginning  of the trail was easy to follow. The buck and his mate had gone into a  thicket, and it was likely that there the pair had spent the night.    \"We'll have our own trouble finding the tracks again,\" said the foreman.  And so it proved; for during the night some cattle and other animals had  passed in and out of the thicket, which covered a large extent of  territory.    At last the hunters hit upon the right trail, and the foreman went  ahead, leaving Roosevelt to keep somewhat toward the outside of the  cover. Both were wide-awake and on the alert, and presently the foreman  announced that he had found the spot where the wounded buck had passed  the night.    \"He is not very far from here,\" said the foreman, and hardly had he said  this than Theodore Roosevelt heard a cracking of fallen twigs and a  breaking of the brush and lower limbs of the trees as the buck rushed  through the thicket. He ran with all speed in the direction and took  station behind a large tree.    Only a few seconds passed, and then the buck showed his head and antlers  among the brushwood. He was gazing ahead anxiously, no doubt trying to  decide if it would be safe to leap into the open and run up the trail.  Then he turned his gaze directly toward where Theodore Roosevelt was  crouching, rifle in hand.    Another instant and it would have been too late. But just as the buck's  head was turned and he sniffed the air suspiciously, the young ranchman  pulled the trigger.    \"He turned his head sharply toward me as I raised the rifle,\" says Mr.  Roosevelt, in writing of this adventure, \"and the bullet went fairly  into his throat, just under the jaw, breaking his neck, and bringing  him down in his tracks with hardly a kick.\"    The buck proved to be an extra fine one, and the two hunters lost no  time in dressing the game and taking it to the ranch. Not wishing to go  back for their horses, the two dragged the game over the snow, each  taking hold of an antler for that purpose. It was intensely cold, so  that each of the hunters had to drag first with one hand and then with  the other for fear of having his fingers frozen.    This was one of the times when the young ranchman and hunter was  successful in his quest. But Mr. Roosevelt has not hesitated to tell of  the many times he has gone out on the hunt only to return empty-handed  and glad enough to get back to a warm shelter and where he was sure of a  good meal.    \"Ranching and hunting was no bed of roses,\" some one who knew him at  that time has said. \"Many a time he came back utterly fagged out and not  a thing to show for his labor. But he never complained, and on the  contrary could generally tell a pretty good story about something he had  seen or had taken note of. In the summer he would examine the nests of  birds and waterfowl with great care, and I have seen him with a horned  frog before him, studying every point of the creature.\"    Once while on the prairie the young ranchman was caught in a heavy  hailstorm. He was out with a number of others, when, with scarcely any  warning, the sky began to grow dark, and the wind came up in fitful  gusts.    \"We must get out of this, and quick too,\" said a companion. And all  pushed onward as fast as they could. But soon the heavy fall of hail  overtook them, and they were glad enough to seek even the slight shelter  of a deep washout, where men and horses huddled close together for  protection. The hailstones came down as large as marbles, causing the  horses to jump around in a fashion that was particularly dangerous to  themselves and to their owners. The time was August, yet the air grew  very cold, and when the storm was over, some cattle were found  completely benumbed. A few had been killed, and there had likewise been  great slaughter among a flock of lambs that had been driven into the Bad  Lands the year previous.    Mr. Roosevelt tells us that the greatest number of black-tailed deer he  ever killed in one day was three. He is a true sportsman in this respect  and does not kill for the mere sake of killing. Those who go out just to  slaughter all they possibly can are not sportsmen, but butchers. To be  sure, a hunter may have to play the butcher at times, when the meat is  needed, but not otherwise.    On the occasion when the three black-tails were laid low the young  ranchman and his foreman started on the hunt very early in the morning,  when the bright moon was still in the sky. It was late in November and  stinging cold, so they allowed their horses to take their own pace,  which was far from slow.    The course of the hunters was up the bed of a dry creek, along which  they passed the still sleeping cattle and also a drove of ponies. Then  they reached a spot where they left their own steeds, and, rifles in  hand, hurried silently toward a great plateau which lay some distance  before them. Signs of deer could be seen on every hand, and both were  certain that the day's outing would prove a grand success.    Theodore Roosevelt had separated from his companion when of a sudden he  caught sight of a beautiful doe. It was a fair shot, and dropping on one  knee he took aim and fired. But to his intense chagrin the doe bounded  off and disappeared in the brushwood.    \"Hit anything?\" sang out the foreman.    \"I am afraid not,\" was the answer.    \"Never mind; better luck next time.\" And then both sank down behind a  rock where they could get a good view of a hollow ahead of them.    They had been behind the rock but a short time when they heard a  cracking of twigs, and a fine black-tail buck came cautiously into view.  Both fired, and the buck rolled over, never to rise again. Then another  deer came into view and both fired again, but the game"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#8)"],[1,"ion. Ivan accepts the wager. The Princess  appears, takes him by the hand, kisses him on the crown of his head,  wipes the dirt off him, and leads him home, still inebriated but no  longer impecunious.[40]    Sometimes even greater people than the peasants get drunk. The story  of \"Semiletka\"[41]--a variant of the well known tale of how a woman's  wit enables her to guess all riddles, to detect all deceits, and to  conquer all difficulties--relates how the heroine was chosen by a  Voyvode[42] as his wife, with the stipulation that if she meddled in  the affairs of his Voyvodeship she was to be sent back to her father,  but allowed to take with her whatever thing belonging to her she  prized most. The marriage takes place, but one day the well known case  comes before him for decision, of the foal of the borrowed mare--does  it belong to the owner of the mare, or to the borrower in whose  possession it was at the time of foaling? The Voyvode adjudges it to  the borrower, and this is how the story ends:--    \"Semiletka heard of this and could not restrain herself, but said that  he had decided unfairly. The Voyvode waxed wroth, and demanded a  divorce. After dinner Semiletka was obliged to go back to her father's  house. But during the dinner she made the Voyvode drink till he was  intoxicated. He drank his fill and went to sleep. While he was  sleeping she had him placed in a carriage, and then she drove away  with him to her father's. When they had arrived there the Voyvode  awoke and said--    \"'Who brought me here?'    \"'I brought you,' said Semiletka; 'there was an agreement between us  that I might take away with me whatever I prized most. And so I have  taken you!'    \"The Voyvode marvelled at her wisdom, and made peace with her. He and  she then returned home and went on living prosperously.\"    But although drunkenness is very tenderly treated in the Skazkas, as  well as in the folk-songs, it forms the subject of many a moral  lesson, couched in terms of the utmost severity, in the _stikhi_ (or  poems of a religious character, sung by the blind beggars and other  wandering minstrels who sing in front of churches), and also in the  \"Legends,\" which are tales of a semi-religious (or rather  demi-semi-religious) nature. No better specimen of the stories of this  class referring to drunkenness can be offered than the history of--        THE AWFUL DRUNKARD.[43]      Once there was an old man who was such an awful drunkard    as passes all description. Well, one day he went to a kabak,    intoxicated himself with liquor, and then went staggering home    blind drunk. Now his way happened to lie across a river.    When he came to the river, he didn't stop long to consider, but    kicked off his boots, hung them round his neck, and walked    into the water. Scarcely had he got half-way across when he    tripped over a stone, tumbled into the water--and there was an    end of him.      Now, he left a son called Petrusha.[44] When Peter saw that    his father had disappeared and left no trace behind, he took the    matter greatly to heart for a time, he wept for awhile, he had a    service performed for the repose of his father's soul, and he    began to act as head of the family. One Sunday he went to    church to pray to God. As he passed along the road a woman    was pounding away in front of him. She walked and walked,    stumbled over a stone, and began swearing at it, saying, \"What    devil shoved you under my feet?\"      Hearing these words, Petrusha said:      \"Good day, aunt! whither away?\"      \"To church, my dear, to pray to God.\"      \"But isn't this sinful conduct of yours? You're going to    church, to pray to God, and yet you think about the Evil One;    your foot stumbles and you throw the fault on the Devil!\"      Well, he went to church and then returned home. He    walked and walked, and suddenly, goodness knows whence,    there appeared before him a fine-looking man, who saluted him    and said:      \"Thanks, Petrusha, for your good word!\"      \"Who are you, and why do you thank me?\" asks Petrusha.      \"I am the Devil.[45] I thank you because, when that woman    stumbled, and scolded me without a cause, you said a good    word for me.\" Then he began to entreat him, saying, \"Come    and pay me a visit, Petrusha. How I will reward you to be    sure! With silver and with gold, with everything will I endow    you.\"      \"Very good,\" says Petrusha, \"I'll come.\"      Having told him all about the road he was to take, the Devil    straightway disappeared, and Petrusha returned home.      Next day Petrusha set off on his visit to the Devil. He    walked and walked, for three whole days did he walk, and then he    reached a great forest, dark and dense--impossible even to see    the sky from within it! And in that forest there stood a rich    palace. Well, he entered the palace, and a fair maiden caught    sight of him. She had been stolen from a certain village by the    evil spirit. And when she caught sight of him she cried:      \"Whatever have you come here for, good youth? here    devils abide, they will tear you to pieces.\"      Petrusha told her how and why he had made his appearance    in that palace.      \"Well now, mind this,\" says the fair maiden; \"the Devil will    begin giving you silver and gold. Don't take any of it, but ask    him to give you the very wretched horse which the evil spirits    use for fetching wood and water. That horse is your father.    When he came out of the kabak drunk, and fell into the water,    the devils immediately seized him and made him their hack, and    now they use him for fetching wood and water.\"      Presently there appeared the gallant who had invited    Petrusha, and began to regale him with all kinds of meat and    drink. And when the time came for Petrusha to be going homewards,    \"Come,\" said the Devil, \"I will provide you with    money and with a capital horse, so that you will speedily get    home.\"      \"I don't want anything,\" replied Petrusha. \"Only, if you    wish to make me a present, give me that sorry jade which you    use for carrying wood and water.\"      \"What good will that be to you? If you ride it home    quickly, I expect it will die!\"      \"No matter, let me have it. I won't take any other.\"      So the Devil gave him that sorry jade. Petrusha took it by    the bridle and led it away. As soon as he reached the gates    there appeared the fair maiden, and asked:      \"Have you got the horse?\"      \"I have.\"      \"Well then, good youth, when you get nigh to your village,    take off your cross, trace a circle three times about this horse,    and hang the cross round its neck.\"      Petrusha took leave of her and went his way. When he    came nigh to his village he did everything exactly as the maiden    had instructed him. He took off his copper cross, traced a    circle three times about the horse, and hung the cross round its    neck. And immediately the horse was no longer there, but in    its place there stood before Petrusha his own father. The son    looked upon the father, burst into tears, and led him to his cottage;    and for three days the old man remained without speaking,    unable to make use of his tongue. And after that they    lived happily and in all prosperity. The old man entirely gave    up drinking, and to his very last day never took so much as a    single drop of spirits.[46]    The Russian peasant is by no means deficient in humor, a fact of  which the Skazkas offer abundant evidence. But it is not easy to find  stories which can be quoted at full length as illustrations of that  humor. The jokes which form the themes of the Russian facetious tales  are for the most part common to all Europe. And a similar assertion  may be made with regard to the stories of most lands. An unfamiliar  joke is but rarely to be discovered in the lower strata of fiction. He  who has read the folk-tales of one country only, is apt to attribute  to its inhabitants a comic originality to which they can lay no claim.  And so a Russian who knows the stories of his own land, but has not  studied those of other countries, is very liable to credit the Skazkas  with the undivided possession of a number of \"merry jests\" in which  they can claim but a very small share--jests which in reality form the  stock-in-trade of rustic wags among the vineyards of France or  Germany, or on the hills of Greece, or beside the fiords of Norway, or  along the coasts of Brittany or Argyleshire--which for centuries have  set beards wagging in Cairo and Ispahan, and in the cool of the  evening hour have cheered the heart of the villager weary with his  day's toil under the burning sun of India.    It is only when the joke hinges upon something which is peculiar to a  people that it is likely to be found among that people only. But most  of the Russian jests turn upon pivots which are familiar to all the  world, and have for their themes such common-place topics as the  incorrigible folly of man, the inflexible obstinacy of woman. And in  their treatments of these subjects they offer very few novel features.  It is strange how far a story of this kind may travel, and yet how  little alteration it may undergo. Take, for instance, the skits  against women which are so universally popular. Far away in outlying  districts of Russia we find the same time-honored quips which have so  long figured in collections of English facetiae. There is the good old  story, for instance, of the dispute between a husband and wife as to  whether a certain rope has been cut with a knife or with scissors,  resulting in the murder of the scissors-upholding wife, who is pitched  into the river by her knife-advocating husband; but not before she  has, in her very death agony, testified to her belief in the scissors  hypothesis by a movement of her fingers above the surface of the  stream.[47] In a Russian form of the story, told in the government of  Astrakhan, the quarrel is about "]]]
