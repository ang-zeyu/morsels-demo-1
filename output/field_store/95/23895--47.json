She probably changed her mind at the last moment and is  staying with friends in town.\"    \"Then you haven't seen her?\" asked Mrs. Rider anxiously.    \"I haven't seen her for several days.\"    \"Is anything wrong?\" Her voice shook for a second, but she recovered  herself. \"You see,\" she made an attempt to smile. \"I have been in the  house for two or three days, and I have seen neither Odette nor--nor  anybody else,\" she added quickly.    Who was she expecting to see, wondered Tarling, and why did she check  herself? Was it possible that she had not heard of the murder? He  determined to test her.    \"Your daughter is probably detained in town owing to Mr. Lyne's death,\"  he said, watching her closely.    She started and went white.    \"Mr. Lyne's death?\" she stammered. \"Has he died? That young man?\"    \"He was murdered in Hyde Park yesterday morning,\" said Tarling, and she  staggered back and collapsed into a chair.    \"Murdered! Murdered!\" she whispered. \"Oh, God! Not that, not that!\"    Her face was ashen white, and she was shaking in every limb, this stately  woman who had walked so serenely into the drawing-room a few minutes  before.    Presently she covered her face with her hands and began to weep softly  and Tarling waited.    \"Did you know Mr. Lyne?\" he asked after a while.    She shook her head.    \"Have you heard any stories about Mr. Lyne?\"    She looked up.    \"None,\" she said listlessly, \"except that he was--not a very nice man.\"    \"Forgive me asking you, but are you very much interested--\" He hesitated,  and she lifted her head.    He did not know how to put this question into words. It puzzled him that  the daughter of this woman, who was evidently well off, should be engaged  in a more or less humble capacity in Lyne's Store. He wanted to know  whether she knew that the girl had been dismissed, and whether that made  much difference to her. Then again, his conversation with Odette Rider  had not led him to the conclusion that she could afford to throw up her  work. She spoke of finding another job, and that did not sound as though  her mother was in a good position.    \"Is there any necessity for your daughter working for a living?\" he asked  bluntly, and she dropped her eyes.    \"It is her wish,\" she said in a low voice. \"She does not get on with  people about here,\" she added hastily.    There was a brief silence, then he rose and offered his hand.    \"I do hope I haven't worried you with my questions,\" he said, \"and I  daresay you wonder why I have come. I will tell you candidly that I am  engaged in investigating this murder, and I was hoping to hear that your  daughter, in common with the other people who were brought into contact  with Mr. Lyne, might give me some thread of a clue which would lead to  more important things.\"    \"A detective?\" she asked, and he could have sworn there was horror in her  eyes.    \"A sort of detective,\" he laughed, \"but not a formidable one, I hope,  Mrs. Rider.\"    She saw him to the door, and watched him as he disappeared down the  drive; then walked slowly back to the room and stood against the marble  mantelpiece, her head upon her arms, weeping softly.    Jack Tarling left Hertford more confused than ever. He had instructed the  fly driver to wait for him at the gates, and this worthy he proceeded to  pump.    Mrs. Rider had been living in Hertford for four years, and was greatly  respected. Did the cabman know the daughter? Oh yes, he had seen the  young lady once or twice, but \"She don't come very often,\" he explained.  \"By all accounts she doesn't get on with her father.\"    \"Her father? I did not know she had a father,\" said Tarling in surprise.    Yes, there was a father. He was an infrequent visitor, and usually came  up from London by the late train and was driven in his own brougham to  the house. He had not seen him--indeed, very few people had, but by all  accounts he was a very nice man, and well-connected in the City.    Tarling had telegraphed to the assistant who had been placed at his  disposal by Scotland Yard, and Detective-Inspector Whiteside was waiting  for him at the station.    \"Any fresh news?\" asked Tarling.    \"Yes, sir, there's rather an important clue come to light,\" said  Whiteside. \"I've got the car here, sir, and we might discuss it on the  way back to the Yard.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Tarling.    \"We got it from Mr. Lyne's manservant,\" said the inspector. \"It appears  that the butler had been going through Mr. Lyne's things, acting on  instructions from headquarters, and in a corner of his writing-desk a  telegram was discovered. I'll show it you when I get to the Yard. It has  a very important bearing upon the case, and I think may lead us to the  murderer.\"    On the word \"telegram\" Tarling felt mechanically in his pockets for the  wire which Mrs. Rider had given him from her daughter. Now he took it out  and read it again. It had been handed in at the General Post Office at  nine o'clock exactly.    \"That's extraordinary, sir,\" Detective-Inspector Whiteside, sitting by  his side, had overlooked the wire.    \"What is extraordinary?\" asked Tarling with an air of surprise.    \"I happened to see the signature to that wire--'Odette,' isn't it?\" said  the Scotland Yard man.    \"Yes,\" nodded Tarling. \"Why? What is there extraordinary in that?\"    \"Well, sir,\" said Whiteside, \"it's something of a coincidence that the  telegram which was found in Mr. Lyne's desk, and making an appointment  with him at a certain flat in the Edgware Road, was also signed 'Odette,'  and,\" he bent forward, looking at the wire still in the astonished  Tarling's hand, \"and,\" he said in triumph, \"it was handed in exactly at  the same time as that!\"    An examination of the telegram at Scotland Yard left no doubt in the  detective's mind that Whiteside had spoken nothing but the truth. An  urgent message was despatched to the General Post Office, and in two  hours the original telegrams were before him. They were both written in  the same hand. The first to her mother, saying that she could not come;  the second to Lyne, running:         \"Will you see me at my flat to-night at eleven o'clock? ODETTE       RIDER.\"    Tarling's heart sank within him. This amazing news was stunning. It was  impossible, impossible, he told himself again and again, that this girl  could have killed Lyne. Suppose she had? Where had they met? Had they  gone driving together, and had she shot him in making the circuit of the  Park? But why should he be wearing list slippers? Why should his coat be  off, and why should the night-dress be bound round and round his body?    He thought the matter out, but the more he thought the more puzzled he  became. It was a very depressed man who interviewed an authority that  night and secured from him a search warrant.    Armed with this and accompanied by Whiteside he made his way to the flat  in Edgware Road, and, showing his authority, secured a pass-key from the  hall porter, who was also the caretaker of the building. Tarling  remembered the last time he had gone to the flat, and it was with a  feeling of intense pity for the girl that he turned the key in the lock  and stepped into the little hall, reaching out his hand and switching on  the light as he did so.    There was nothing in the hall to suggest anything unusual. There was just  that close and musty smell which is peculiar to all buildings which have  been shut up, even for a few days.    But there was something else.    Tarling sniffed and Whiteside sniffed. A dull, \"burnt\" smell, some  pungent, \"scorched\" odour, which he recognised as the stale stench of  exploded cordite. He went into the tiny dining-room; everything was neat,  nothing displaced.    \"That's curious,\" said Whiteside, pointing to the sideboard, and Tarling  saw a deep glass vase half filled with daffodils. Two or three blossoms  had either fallen or had been pulled out, and were lying, shrivelled and  dead, on the polished surface of the sideboard.    \"Humph!\" said Tarling. \"I don't like this very much.\"    He turned and walked back into the hall and opened another door, which  stood ajar. Again he turned on the light. He was in the girl's bedroom.  He stopped dead, and slowly examined the room. But for the disordered  appearance of the chest of drawers, there was nothing unusual in the  appearance of the room. At the open doors of the bureau a little heap of  female attire had been thrown pell-mell upon the floor. All these were  eloquent of hasty action. Still more was a small suit-case, half packed,  an the bed, also left in a great hurry.    Tarling stepped into the room, and if he had been half blind he could not  have missed the last and most damning evidence of all. The carpet was of  a biscuit colour and covered the room flush to the wainscot. Opposite the  fireplace was a big, dark red, irregular stain.    Tarling's face grew tense.    \"This is where Lyne was shot,\" he said.    \"And look there!\" said Whiteside excitedly, pointing to the chest of  drawers.    Tarling stepped quickly across the room and pulled out a garment  which hung over the edge of the drawer. It was a night-dress--a silk  night-dress with two little sprays of forget-me-nots embroidered  on the sleeves. It was the companion to that which had been found about  Lyne's body. And there was something more. The removal of the garment  from the drawer disclosed a mark on the white enamel of the bureau. It  was a bloody thumb print!    The detective looked round at his assistant, and the expression of his  face was set in its hardest mask.    \"Whiteside,\" he said quietly, \"swear out a warrant for the arrest of  Odette Rider on a charge of wilful murder. Telegraph all stations to  detain this girl, and let me know the result.\"    Without another word he turned from the room and walked back to his  lodgings."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#8)"],[1," and  their compounds partake of these relations. We speak here only of the  individual beauty of colours, and not of that relative beauty by which  every tint, hue, and shade of colour become pleasing, or otherwise  according to space, place, and reference; for this latter beauty belongs  to the general nature and harmony of colours.    In respect to _pigments_ individually, it may be observed that--other  things being equal--those pigments are the most beautiful which possess  the most colour, whether they be light or dark, opaque or transparent,  bright or subdued. There are some which exhibit all their colour at a  glance: there are others that the more they are looked into the more  colour they are found to have--containing, as they do, an amount of  _latent colour_, not immediately apparent. Apart from the beauty which a  wealth of colour imparts, those pigments imbued with it are, as a rule,  the most permanent. And not unnaturally so, for the more colour there is  present, the longer it takes to be affected, either by exposure or  impure air. Colour within colour, therefore, not only lends charm to a  pigment, but contributes to its safety.    There is often a vicious predilection of some artists in favour of a  particular colour, from which many of our best colourists have not been  totally free, and which arises from organic defect, or mental  association. Such predilection is greatly to be guarded against by the  colourist, who is every way surrounded by dangers. On the one hand,  there is fear lest he fall into whiteness or chalkiness; on the other,  into blackness or gloom: in front he may run into fire and foxiness, or  he may slide backward into cold and leaden dulness: all of which are  extremes he must avoid. There are also other important prejudices to  which the eye is liable in regard to colours individually, that demand  his particular attention. These are occasioned by the various specific  powers of single colours acting on the eye according to their masses and  the activity of light, or the length of time they are viewed. By  consequence, vision becomes over-stimulated, unequally exhausted, and  endued, even before it is fatigued, with a spectrum which not only  clouds the colour itself, but gives a false brilliancy by contrast to  surrounding hues, so as totally or partially to throw the eye off its  balance, and mislead the judgment. This derangement of the organ may be  caused by a powerful tint on the palette, a mass of drapery, the colour  of a wall, the light of a room, or other accidental circumstance; and  the remedy is to refresh the eye with a new object--of nature, if  possible--or to give it rest. The powers of colours in these respects,  as well as of pigments individually, together with their reciprocal  action and influence chemically, will be adverted to under their  distinct heads.    The attention of the artist to the individual powers of pigments,  although it may be of less concern than the attention to general effect  in colouring, is by no means less necessary in practice. For he who  would excel in colouring must study it from several points of view, in  respect to the whole and the parts of a picture, as regards mind and  body, and concerning itself alone. To this end, is needed a knowledge of  his pigments individually.    If nature has arrayed herself in all the colours of the rainbow, she has  not been niggardly in offering man the materials wherewith to copy them.  The mineral, animal, vegetable kingdom--each helps him to realize,  however faintly, her many manifold beauties: to give some idea, however  slight, of that glorious flood of colour, which light lets loose upon  the world. Metal, ore, earth, stone; root, plant, flower, fruit; beast,  fish, insect--in turn aid the arduous task. The painter's box is a very  museum of curiosities, from every part of the universe. For it, the  mines yield their treasures, as well as the depths of the sea: to it  come Arab camel, and English ox, cuttle-fish and crawling coccus: in it  the Indian indigo lies next the madder of France, and the gaudy  vermilion of China brightens the mummy of Egypt. Varied, indeed, are the  sources whence we derive our pigments; and if they still leave much to  desire, improvement is clearly manifest. Slowly but surely, year by  year, we are advancing. With the growth of science, the exhaustless  stores of creation, will there at last be attained--step by step, though  it be--that summit of the artist's hopes, a perfect palette?          CHAPTER VII.    ON THE NEUTRAL, WHITE.      The term \"colour\" is equivocal when applied to the neutrals, yet the  artist is bound to consider them as colours; for a thing cannot but be  that of which it is composed, and neutrals are composed of, or  comprehend, all colours.    With regard to colour, then, _white_ in a perfect state should be  neutral in hue, and absolutely opaque; that white being the best which  reflects light most brilliantly. This property in white is called  _body_; by which in other pigments, especially those that are  transparent, is meant _tingeing power_. White, besides its uses as a  colour, is the instrument of light in painting, and compounds when pure  with all colours, without changing their class. Yet it dilutes and cools  all colours except blue, which is specifically cold; and, though it does  not change nor defile any colour, it is changed and defiled by all  colours. This pureness of white, if it be not in some degree broken or  tinged, will cast down or degrade every other colour in a picture, and  itself become harsh and crude. Hence the lowness of tone which has been  thought a necessity in painting, but is such only because our other  colours do not approach to the purity of white. Had we all necessary  colours thus relatively pure as white, colouring in painting might be  carried up to the full brilliancy of nature; and, in fact, more progress  has already been made in that respect, than the prejudice for dulness is  disposed to tolerate.    Locally, white is the most advancing of all colours in a picture, and  produces the effect of throwing others back in different degrees,  according to their specific retiring and advancing powers. These latter,  however, are not absolute qualities of colours, but depend on the  relations of light and shade, which are variously appropriate to all  colours. Hence it is that a white object rightly adapted, appears to  detach, distribute, and put in keeping; as well as to give relief,  decision, distinctness, and distance to every thing around it: hence,  too, the use and requirement of a white or light object, in each  separate group of a composition. White itself is advanced or brought  forward, unless indeed white surround a dark object, in which case they  retire together. In mixture, white communicates these properties to its  tints, and harmonizes in conjunction with, or in opposition to all  colours; but lies nearest in series to yellow, and remotest from blue,  of which, next to black, it is the most thorough contrast. It is  correlative with black, which is the opposite extreme of neutrality.    Perfect white is opaque, and perfect black transparent; hence when added  to black in minute proportion, white gives it solidity; and from a like  small proportion of black combined with white, the latter acquires  locality as a colour, and better preserves its hue in painting. Both  white and black communicate these properties to other colours, in  proportion to their lightness or depth; while they cool each other in  mixture, and equally contrast each other when opposed. These extremes of  the chromatic scale are each in its way most easily denied, as green,  the mean of the scale, is the greatest defiler of all colours. Rubens  regarded white as the nourishment of light, and the poison of shadow.    In a picture, white should not be merely glittering or brilliant, but  tender as well as bright. The eye should seek it for rest, brilliant  though it may be; and feel it as a space of strange heavenly paleness in  the midst of the flushing of the colours. This effect can only be  reached by general depth of middle tint, by the perfect absence of any  white, save where it is needed, and by keeping the white itself subdued  by grey, except at a few points of chief lustre.    White, as a pigment, is of more extensive use than any other colour in  oil painting and fresco, owing to its local quality, its representing  light, and its entering into composition with all colours in the  formation of tints. The old masters have been supposed by some to  possess whites superior to our own, but this may be questioned. The  pureness of whites in some celebrated old pictures is rather to be  attributed to a proper method of using, careful preservation of the  work, and in many instances to the introduction of ultramarine or a  permanent cold colour into the white--such as plumbago--helped also by  judicious contrast.    Notwithstanding white pigments are tolerably numerous, a thoroughly  unexceptionable white is still a desideratum--one combining the perfect  opacity or body of white lead with the perfect permanency of zinc white.  The nearest approach to it that has yet been made, is Chinese white,  which possesses in a great measure the property of the former, and,  being a preparation of zinc, has wholly that of the latter.  Unfortunately Chinese white is a water-colour pigment only, not  retaining its several advantages, stability excepted, when employed in  oil.    1. CONSTANT WHITE,    Also called _Permanent white_, and _Barytic white_, is, when well  prepared, of superior body in water, but has less opacity in oil. It  works in a somewhat unsatisfactory and unpleasant manner, and is  considerably lower in its tone while wet than when dry, a fault which  subjects even an experienced artist to great uncertainty where he uses  it in compound tints.
