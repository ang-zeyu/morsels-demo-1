It was a period of immense industrial expansion, and the men who  directed this wanted a free hand. In 1878 the American Bar Association  was formed from the elite of the American Bar. Organized as it was in  the wake of the \"barbarous\" decision--as one member termed it--in Munn  _v._ Illinois,[67] in which the Supreme Court had held that states were  entitled by virtue of their police power to prescribe the charges of  \"businesses affected with a public interest,\" the Association, through  its more eminent members, became the mouthpiece of a new constitutional  philosophy which was compounded in about equal parts from the teachings  of the British Manchester School of Political Economy and Herbert  Spencer's highly sentimentalized version of the doctrine of evolution,  just then becoming the intellectual vogue; plus a \"booster\"--in the  chemical sense--from Sir Henry Maine's _Ancient Law_, first published in  1861. I refer to Maine's famous dictum that \"the movement of the  progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from _Status to  Contract_\". If hitherto, why not henceforth?[68]    In short, the American people were presented, overnight as it were, with  a new doctrine of Natural Law. Encouraged by certain dicta of dissenting  Justices of the Supreme Court, a growing procession of high State  courts--those of New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Massachusetts,  leading the way--now began infiltrating the due process clauses and  especially the word \"liberty\" thereof, of their several State  constitutions with the new revelation. The product of these activities  was the doctrine of freedom of contract, the substantial purport of  which was that any legislation which restricted the liberty of male  persons twenty-one years of age, whether they were employers or  employees, in the making of business contracts, far from being  presumptively constitutional, must be justified by well known facts of  which the court was entitled to take judicial notice; otherwise it fell  under the ban of the due process clause.[69]    At last, in 1898, the Supreme Court at Washington, following some  tentative gestures in that direction, accepted the new dispensation  outright. In Smyth _v._ Ames decided that year, partially overturning  Munn _v._ Illinois, it gave notice of its intention to review in detail  the \"reasonableness\" of railway rates set by State authority and in  Holden _v._ Hardy it ratified, at the same term, the doctrine of freedom  of contract.[70] The result of the two holdings for the Court's  constitutional jurisdiction is roughly indicated by the fact that  whereas it had decided 134 cases under the Amendment during the thirty  preceding years, in the ensuing thirteen years it decided 430 such  cases.[71]    For more than a generation now the Court became the ultimate guardian,  in the name of the Constitutional Document, of the _laissez-faire_  conception of the proper relation of Government to Private Enterprise, a  rather inconstant guardian, however, for its fluctuating membership  tipped the scales now in favor of Business, now in favor of Government.  And today the latter tendency appears to have prevailed. In its  decisions early in 1937 sustaining outstanding Roosevelt Administration  measures, the Court not only subordinated the freedom of employers to  contract to the freedom of employees to organize, but intimated broadly  that liberty in some of its phases is much more dependent upon  legislative implementation that upon judicial protection.[72]    In contrast to this withdrawal, however, has been the Court's projection  of another segment of \"liberty\" into new territory. In Gitlow _v._ New  York,[73] decided in 1925, even in sustaining an antisyndicalist  statute, the Court adopted _arguendo_ the proposition which it had  previously rejected, that \"liberty\" in Amendment XIV renders available  against the States the restraints which Amendment I imposes on Congress.  For fifteen years little happened. Then in 1940, the Court supplemented  its ruling in the Gitlow Case with the so-called \"Clear and Present  Danger\" rule, an expedient which was designed to divest state enactments  restrictive of freedom of speech, of press, of religion, and so forth,  of their presumed validity, just as, earlier, statutes restrictive of  freedom of contract had been similarly disabled. By certain of the  Justices, this result was held to be required by \"the preferred  position\" of some of these freedoms in the hierarchy of constitutional  values; an idea to which certain other Justices demurred. The result to  date has been a series of holdings the net product of which for our  Constitutional Law is at this juncture difficult to estimate; and the  recent decision in Dennis _v._ United States under Amendment I augments  the difficulty.[74]    A passing glance will suffice for the operation of the due process  clause of Amendment V in the domain of foreign relations and the War  Power. The reader has only to consult in these pages such holdings as  those in Belmont _v._ United States, Yakus _v._ United States, Korematsu  _v._ United States, to be persuaded that even the Constitution is no  exception to the maxim, _inter arma silent leges_.[75]    In short, the substantive doctrine of due process of law does not today  support judicial intervention in the field of social and economic  legislation in anything like the same measure that it did, first in the  States, then through the Supreme Court on the basis of Amendment XIV, in  the half century between 1885 and 1935. But this fact does not signify  that the clause is not, in both its procedural sense and its broader  sense, especially when supplemented by the equal protection clause of  Amendment XIV, a still valuable and viable source of judicial protection  against parochial despotisms and petty tyrannies. Yet even in this  respect, as certain recent decisions have shown, the Court can often act  more effectively on the basis of congressional legislation implementing  the Amendment than when operating directly on the basis of the Amendment  itself.[76]      Resume    Considered for the two fundamental subjects of the powers of government  and the liberties of individuals, interpretation of the Constitution by  the Supreme Court falls into four tolerably distinguishable periods. The  first, which reaches to the death of Marshall, is the period of the  dominance of the Constitutional Document. The tradition concerning the  original establishment of the Constitution was still fresh, and in the  person and office of the great Chief Justice the intentions of the  framers enjoyed a renewed vitality. This is not to say that Marshall did  not have views of his own to advance; nor is it to say that the  historicity of a particular theory concerning the Constitution is  necessarily a matter of critical concern save to students of history. It  is only to say that the theories which Marshall urged in support of his  preferences were, in fact, frequently verifiable as theories of the  framers of the Constitution.    The second period is a lengthy one, stretching from the accession of  Chief Justice Taney in 1835 to, say, 1895. It is the period _par  excellence_ of Constitutional Theory. More and more the constitutional  text fades into the background, and the testimony of the _Federalist_,  Marshall's sole book of precedents, ceases to be cited. Among the  theories which in one way or other received the Court's approval during  this period were the notion of Dual Federalism, the doctrine of the  Police Power, the taboo on delegation of legislative power, the derived  doctrine of Due Process of Law, the conception of liberty as Freedom of  Contract, and still others. The sources of some of these doctrines and  the nature of the interests benefited by them have been indicated  earlier in these pages. Their net result was to put the national  law-making power into a strait-jacket so far as the regulation of  business was concerned.    The third period was that of Judicial Review pure and simple. The Court,  as heir to the accumulated doctrines of its predecessors, found itself  for the time being in possession of such a variety of instruments of  constitutional exegesis that it was often able to achieve almost any  result in the field of constitutional interpretation which it considered  desirable, and that without flagrant departure from judicial good form.  Indeed, it is altogether apparent that the Court was in actual  possession and in active exercise of what Justice Holmes once termed  \"the sovereign prerogative of choice.\" It was early in this period that  Governor Hughes, soon to ascend the Bench, said, without perhaps  intending all that his words literally conveyed, \"We are under a  Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.\" A  decade later it was suggested by an eminent law teacher that attorneys  arguing \"due process cases\" before the Court ought to address the  Justices not as \"Your Honors\" but as \"Your Lordships\"; and Senator  Borah, in the Senate debate on Mr. Hughes' nomination for Chief Justice,  in 1930, declared that the Supreme Court had become \"economic dictator  in the United States\". Some of the Justices concurred in these  observations, especially Justices Holmes and Brandeis. Asserted the  latter, the Court has made itself \"a super-legislature\" and Justice  Holmes could discover \"hardly any limit but the sky\" to the power  claimed by the Court to disallow State acts \"which may happen to strike  a majority [of its members] as for any reason undesirable\".[77]    The fourth period is still with us. It was ushered in by World War I,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1864"],[0,"Hero Tales from American History (#8)"],[1,"was forced to give way, for there were no bayonets wherewith to  meet the foe; but the backwoodsmen retreated only so long as the charge  lasted, and the minute that it stopped they stopped too, and came  back ever closer to the ridge and ever with a deadlier fire. Ferguson,  blowing a silver whistle as a signal to his men, led these charges,  sword in hand, on horseback. At last, just as he was once again rallying  his men, the riflemen of Sevier and Shelby crowned the top of the ridge.  The gallant British commander became a fair target for the backwoodsmen,  and as for the last time he led his men against them, seven bullets  entered his body and he fell dead. With his fall resistance ceased.  The regulars and Tories huddled together in a confused mass, while the  exultant Americans rushed forward. A flag of truce was hoisted, and all  the British who were not dead surrendered.    The victory was complete, and the backwoodsmen at once started to return  to their log hamlets and rough, lonely farms. They could not stay, for  they dared not leave their homes at the mercy of the Indians. They had  rendered a great service; for Cornwallis, when he heard of the disaster  to his trusted lieutenant, abandoned his march northward, and retired to  South Carolina. When he again resumed the offensive, he found his path  barred by stubborn General Greene and his troops of the Continental  line.          THE STORMING OF STONY POINT          In their ragged regimentals        Stood the old Continentals,         Yielding not,        When the grenadiers were lunging,        And like hail fell the plunging         Cannon-shot;         When the files         Of the isles     From the smoky night encampment bore the banner of the rampant     Unicorn,     And grummer, grummer, grummer, rolled the roll of the drummer,         Through the morn!          Then with eyes to the front all,        And with guns horizontal,         Stood our sires;        And the balls whistled deadly,        And in streams flashing redly         Blazed the fires;         As the roar         On the shore     Swept the strong battle-breakers o'er the green-sodded acres         Of the plain;     And louder, louder, louder cracked the black gunpowder,         Cracked amain!                         --Guy Humphrey McMaster.      One of the heroic figures of the Revolution was Anthony Wayne,  Major-General of the Continental line. With the exception of Washington,  and perhaps Greene, he was the best general the Americans developed in  the contest; and without exception he showed himself to be the hardest  fighter produced on either side. He belongs, as regards this latter  characteristic, with the men like Winfield Scott, Phil Kearney, Hancock,  and Forrest, who reveled in the danger and the actual shock of arms.  Indeed, his eager love of battle, and splendid disregard of peril,  have made many writers forget his really great qualities as a general.  Soldiers are always prompt to recognize the prime virtue of physical  courage, and Wayne's followers christened their daring commander \"Mad  Anthony,\" in loving allusion to his reckless bravery. It is perfectly  true that Wayne had this courage, and that he was a born fighter;  otherwise, he never would have been a great commander. A man who lacks  the fondness for fighting, the eager desire to punish his adversary,  and the willingness to suffer punishment in return, may be a great  organizer, like McClellan, but can never become a great general or win  great victories. There are, however, plenty of men who, though they  possess these fine manly traits, yet lack the head to command an army;  but Wayne had not only the heart and the hand but the head likewise.  No man could dare as greatly as he did without incurring the risk of an  occasional check; but he was an able and bold tactician, a vigilant  and cautious leader, well fitted to bear the terrible burden of  responsibility which rests upon a commander-in-chief.    Of course, at times he had some rather severe lessons. Quite early in  his career, just after the battle of the Brandywine, when he was set to  watch the enemy, he was surprised at night by the British general Grey,  a redoubtable fighter, who attacked him with the bayonet, killed a  number of his men, and forced him to fall back some distance from the  field of action. This mortifying experience had no effect whatever on  Wayne's courage or self-reliance, but it did give him a valuable lesson  in caution. He showed what he had learned by the skill with which, many  years later, he conducted the famous campaign in which he overthrew the  Northwestern Indians at the Fight of the Fallen Timbers.    Wayne's favorite weapon was the bayonet, and, like Scott he taught his  troops, until they were able in the shock of hand-to-hand conflict to  overthrow the renowned British infantry, who have always justly prided  themselves on their prowess with cold steel. At the battle of Germantown  it was Wayne's troops who, falling on with the bayonet, drove the  Hessians and the British light infantry, and only retreated under orders  when the attack had failed elsewhere. At Monmouth it was Wayne and his  Continentals who first checked the British advance by repulsing the  bayonet charge of the guards and grenadiers.    Washington, a true leader of men, was prompt to recognize in Wayne a  soldier to whom could be intrusted any especially difficult enterprise  which called for the exercise alike of intelligence and of cool daring.  In the summer of 1780 he was very anxious to capture the British fort at  Stony Point, which commanded the Hudson. It was impracticable to attack  it by regular siege while the British frigates lay in the river, and the  defenses ere so strong that open assault by daylight was equally out of  the question. Accordingly Washington suggested to Wayne that he try a  night attack. Wayne eagerly caught at the idea. It was exactly the kind  of enterprise in which he delighted. The fort was on a rocky promontory,  surrounded on three sides by water, and on the fourth by a neck of land,  which was for the most part mere morass. It was across this neck of  land that any attacking column had to move. The garrison was six hundred  strong. To deliver the assault Wayne took nine hundred men. The  American army was camped about fourteen miles from Stony Point. One July  afternoon Wayne started, and led his troops in single file along the  narrow rocky roads, reaching the hills on the mainland near the fort  after nightfall. He divided his force into two columns, to advance one  along each side of the neck, detaching two companies of North Carolina  troops to move in between the two columns and make a false attack.  The rest of the force consisted of New Englanders, Pennsylvanians,  and Virginians. Each attacking column was divided into three parts, a  forlorn hope of twenty men leading, which was followed by an advance  guard of one hundred and twenty, and then by the main body. At the time  commanding officers still carried spontoons, and other old-time weapons,  and Wayne, who himself led the right column, directed its movements  spear in hand. It was nearly midnight when the Americans began to press  along the causeways toward the fort. Before they were near the walls  they were discovered, and the British opened a heavy fire of great guns  and musketry, to which the Carolinians, who were advancing between the  two columns, responded in their turn, according to orders; but the men  in the columns were forbidden to fire. Wayne had warned them that their  work must be done with the bayonet, and their muskets were not even  loaded. Moreover, so strict was the discipline that no one was allowed  to leave the ranks, and when one of the men did so an officer promptly  ran him through the body.    No sooner had the British opened fire than the charging columns broke  into a run, and in a moment the forlorn hopes plunged into the abattis  of fallen timber which the British had constructed just without the  walls. On the left, the forlorn hope was very roughly handled, no less  than seventeen of the twenty men being either killed or wounded, but as  the columns came up both burst through the down timber and swarmed up  the long, sloping embankments of the fort. The British fought well,  cheering loudly as their volley's rang, but the Americans would not be  denied, and pushed silently on to end the contest with the bayonet. A  bullet struck Wayne in the head. He fell, but struggled to his feet and  forward, two of his officers supporting him. A rumor went among the  men that he was dead, but it only impelled them to charge home, more  fiercely than ever.    With a rush the troops swept to the top of the wall. A fierce but  short fight followed in the intense darkness, which was lit only by the  flashes from the British muskets. The Americans did not fire, trusting  solely to the bayonet. The two columns had kept almost equal pace, and  they swept into the fort from opposite sides at the same moment. The  three men who first got over the walls were all wounded, but one of  them hauled down the British flag. The Americans had the advantage  which always comes from delivering an attack that is thrust home. Their  muskets were unloaded and they could not hesitate; so, running boldly  into close quarters, they fought hand to hand with their foes and  speedily overthrew them. For a moment the bayonets flashed and played;  then the British lines broke as their assailants thronged against them,  and the struggle was over. The Americans had lost a hundred in killed  and wounded. Of the British sixty-three had been slain and very many  wounded, every one of the dead or disabled having suffered from the  bayonet. A curious coincidence was that the number of the dead happened  to be exactly equal to the number of Wayne's men who had been killed in  the night attack by the English general, Grey.    There was"]]]
