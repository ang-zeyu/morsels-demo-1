His mother, Mary of Nazareth,        Sat watching beside his place of rest,      Watching the even flow of his breath,      For the joy of life and the terror of death        Were mingled together in her breast.        They laid their offerings at his feet:        The gold was their tribute to a King;      The frankincense, with its odor sweet,      Was for the Priest, the Paraclete;        The myrrh for the body's burying.        And the mother wondered and bowed her head,        And sat as still as a statue of stone;      Her heart was troubled yet comforted,      Remembering what the angel had said        Of an endless reign and of David's throne.        Then the Kings rode out of the city gate,        With a clatter of hoofs in proud array;      But they went not back to Herod the Great,      For they knew his malice and feared his hate,        And returned to their homes by another way.           *       *       *       *       *        HYMN ON THE NATIVITY        JOHN MILTON        It was the winter wild,      While the heaven-born child        All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;      Nature, in awe of him,      Had doffed her gaudy trim,        With her great Master so to sympathize:      It was no season then for her      To wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour.        Only with speeches fair      She wooes the gentle air,        To hide her guilty front with innocent snow;      And on her naked shame,      Pollute with sinful blame,        The saintly veil of maiden-white to throw;      Confounded, that her Maker's eyes      Should look so near upon her foul deformities.        But he, her fears to cease,      Sent down the meek-eyed Peace:        She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding      Down through the turning sphere,      His ready harbinger,        With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;      And, waving wide her myrtle wand,      She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.        No war or battle's sound      Was heard the world around:        The idle spear and shield were high uphung;      The hooked chariot stood      Unstained with hostile blood;        The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;      And kings sat still with awful eye,      As if they surely knew their sovereign lord was by.        But peaceful was the night,      Wherein the Prince of Light        His reign of peace upon the earth began:      The winds, with wonder whist,      Smoothly the waters kissed,        Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,      Who now hath quite forgot to rave,      While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.        The stars, with deep amaze,      Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,        Bending one way their precious influence;      And will not take their flight,      For all the morning light,        Or Lucifer had often warned them thence:      But in their glimmering orbs did glow,      Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.        And, though the shady gloom      Had given day her room,        The sun himself withheld his wonted speed,      And hid his head for shame.      As his inferior flame        The new-enlightened world no more should need;      He saw a greater sun appear      Than his bright throne, or burning axletree, could bear.        The shepherds on the lawn,      Or ere the point of dawn,        Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;      Full little thought they then      That the mighty Pan        Was kindly come to live with them below;      Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,      Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.        When such music sweet      Their hearts and ears did greet,        As never was by mortal fingers strook,      Divinely warbled voice      Answering the stringed noise,        As all their souls in blissful rapture took:      The air, such pleasure loath to lose,      With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.        Nature, that heard such sound,      Beneath the hollow round        Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling,      Now was almost won,      To think her part was done,        And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;      She knew such harmony alone      Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union.        At last surrounds their sight      A globe of circular light,        That with long beams the shame-faced night arrayed;      The helmed cherubim,      And sworded seraphim,        Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,      Harping in loud and solemn quire,      With unexpressive notes, to Heaven's new-born heir.        Such music as 'tis said      Before was never made,        But when of old the sons of morning sung,      While the Creator great      His constellations set,        And the well-balanced world on hinges hung,      And cast the dark foundations deep,      And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.        Ring out, ye crystal spheres,      Once bless our human ears,        If ye have power to touch our senses so;      And let your silver chime      Move in melodious time;        And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;      And, with your ninefold harmony,      Make up full concert to the angelic symphony.        For, if such holy song      Enwrap our fancy long,        Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold;      And speckled Vanity      Will sicken soon and die,        And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;      And Hell itself will pass away,      And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.        Yea, Truth and Justice then      Will down return to men,        Orbed in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,      Mercy will sit between,      Throned in celestial sheen,        With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;      And Heaven, as at some festival,      Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.        But wisest Fate says no,      This must not yet be so;        The babe yet lies in smiling infancy,      That on the bitter cross      Must redeem our loss,        So both himself and us to glorify:      Yet first, to those chained in sleep,      The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,        With such a horrid clang      As on Mount Sinai rang,        While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake;      The aged earth aghast,      With terror of that blast,        Shall from the surface to the centre shake;      When, at the world's last session,      The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.        And then at last our bliss,      Full and perfect is,        But now begins; for, from this happy day,      The old dragon, underground,      In straiter limits bound,        Not half so far casts his usurped sway;      And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,      Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.        The oracles are dumb;      No voice or hideous hum        Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.      Apollo from his shrine      Can no more divine,        With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.      No nightly trance, or breathed spell,      Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.        The lonely mountains o'er,      And the resounding shore,        A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;      From haunted spring and dale,      Edged with poplar pale,        The parting Genius is with sighing sent;      With flower-inwoven tresses torn,      The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.        In consecrated earth,      And on the holy hearth,        The Lars and Lemures mourn with midnight plaint.      In urns and altars round,      A drear and dying sound        Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;      And the chill marble seems to sweat,      While each peculiar power foregoes his wonted seat.        Peor and Baaelim      Forsake their temples dim        With that twice-battered God of Palestine;      And mooned Ashtaroth      Heaven's queen and mother both,        Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;      The Libyac Hammon shrinks his horn;      In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.        And sullen Moloch, fled,      Hath left in shadows dread        His burning idol all of blackest hue:      In vain with cymbals' ring      They call the grisly king,        In dismal dance about the furnace blue:      The brutish gods of Nile as fast,      Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.        Nor is Osiris seen      In Memphian grove or green,        Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud;      Nor can he be at rest      Within his sacred chest,        Naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud;      In vain with timbrelled anthems dark      The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark.        He feels from Judah's land      The dreaded infant's hand,        The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyne;      Nor all the gods beside      Longer dare abide,        Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine;      Our babe, to show his Godhead true,      Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew.        So, when the sun in bed,      Curtained with cloudy red,        Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,      The flocking shadows pale      Troop to the infernal jail,        Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave;      And the yellow-skirted fays      Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.        But see, the Virgin blest      Hath laid her babe to rest;        Time is our tedious song should here have ending:      Heaven's youngest-teemed star      Hath fixed her polished car,        Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;      And all about the courtly stable        Bright-harnessed angels sit in order serviceable.           *       *       *       *       *          II    CELEBRATION        CHRISTMAS EVE AT MR. WARDLE'S    From \"Pickwick Papers\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#8)"],[1,"fire-light glare.    But anon, a misty teardrop came    In her eyes of faded blue,  Then trickled down in a furrow deep    Like a single drop of dew;  So deep was the channel--so silent the stream--  That the good man saw naught but the dimmed eye-beam.    Yet marveled he much that the cheerful light    Of her eye had heavy grown,  And marveled he more at the tangled balls,    So he said in a gentle tone:  \"I have shared thy joys since our marriage vow,  Conceal not from me thy sorrows now.\"    Then she spoke of the time when the basket there    Was filled to the very brim;  And now, there remained of the goodly pile    But a single pair--for him;  \"Then wonder not at the dimmed eye-light,  There's but one pair of stockings to mend to-night.    \"I cannot but think of the busy feet    Whose wrappings were wont to lay  In the basket, awaiting the needle's time--    Now wandering so far away;  How the sprightly steps to a mother dear,  Unheeded fell on the careless ear.    \"For each empty nook in the basket old    By the hearth there's a vacant seat;  And I miss the shadows from off the wall,    And the patter of many feet;  'Tis for this that a tear gathered over my sight,  At the one pair of stockings to mend to-night.    \"'Twas said that far through the forest wild,    And over the mountains bold,  Was a land whose rivers and darkening caves    Were gemmed with the rarest gold;  Then my first-born turned from the oaken door--  And I knew the shadows were only four.    \"Another went forth on the foaming wave,    And diminished the basket's store;  But his feet grew cold--so weary and cold,    They'll never be warm any more.  And this nook, in its emptiness, seemeth to me  To give forth no voice but the moan of the sea.    \"Two others have gone toward the setting sun,    And made them a home in its light,  And fairy fingers have taken their share,    To mend by the fireside bright;  Some other baskets their garments will fill--  But mine, ah, mine is emptier still.    \"Another--the dearest, the fairest, the best--    Was taken by angels away,  And clad in a garment that waxeth not old,    In a land of continual day;  Oh! wonder no more at the dimmed eye-light,  When I mend the one pair of stockings to-night.\"          The Young Man Waited      In the room below the young man sat,  With an anxious face and a white cravat,  A throbbing heart and a silken hat,  And various other things like that    Which he had accumulated.  And the maid of his heart was up above  Surrounded by hat and gown and glove,  And a thousand things which women love,  But no man knoweth the names thereof--    And the young man sat and--waited.    You will scarce believe the things I tell,  But the truth thereof I know full well,    Though how may not be stated;  But I swear to you that the maiden took  A sort of half-breed, thin stove-hook,  And heated it well in the gaslight there.  And thrust it into her head, or hair.  Then she took something off the bed,  And hooked it onto her hair, or head,  And piled it high, and piled it higher,  And drove it home with staples of wire!    And the young man anxiously--waited.    Then she took a thing she called a \"puff\"  And some very peculiar whitish stuff,  And using about a half a peck,  She spread it over her face and neck,    (Deceit was a thing she hated!)  And she looked as fair as a lilied bower,  Or a pound of lard or a sack of flour;--    And the young man wearily--waited.    Then she took a garment of awful shape  And it wasn't a waist, nor yet a cape,  But it looked like a piece of ancient mail,  Or an instrument from a Russian jail,  And then with a fearful groan and gasp,  She squeezed herself in its deathly clasp--    So fair and yet so fated!  And then with a move like I don't know what,  She tied it on with a double knot;--    And the young man wofully--waited.    Then she put on a dozen different things,  A mixture of buttons and hooks and strings,  Till she strongly resembled a notion store;  Then, taking some seventeen pins or more,  She thrust them into her ruby lips,  Then stuck them around from waist to hips,    And never once hesitated.  And the maiden didn't know, perhaps,  That the man below had had seven naps,    And that now he sleepily--waited.    And then she tried to put on her hat,  Ah me, a trying ordeal was that!  She tipped it high and she tried it low,  But every way that the thing would go    Only made her more agitated.  It wouldn't go straight and it caught her hair,  And she wished she could hire a man to swear,  But alas, the only man lingering there    Was the one who wildly--waited.    And then before she could take her leave,  She had to puff up her monstrous sleeve.  Then a little dab here and a wee pat there.  And a touch or two to her hindmost hair,  Then around the room with the utmost care    She thoughtfully circulated.  Then she seized her gloves and a chamoiskin,  Some breath perfume and a long stickpin,  A bonbon box and a cloak and some  Eau-de-cologne and chewing-gum,  Her opera glass and sealskin muff,  A fan and a heap of other stuff;  Then she hurried down, but ere she spoke,  Something about the maiden broke.  So she scurried back to the winding stair,  And the young man looked in wild despair,    And then he--evaporated.        _Edmund Vance Cooke._          Invictus      Out of the night that covers me,    Black as the Pit from pole to pole,  I thank whatever gods may be    For my unconquerable soul.    In the fell clutch of circumstance    I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeonings of chance    My head is bloody, but unbowed.    Beyond this place of wrath and tears    Looms but the Horror of the shade,  And yet the menace of the years    Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.    It matters not how strait the gate,    How charged with punishments the scroll,  I am the master of my fate;    I am the captain of my soul.        _William E. Henley._          Katie Lee and Willie Grey      Two brown heads with tossing curls,  Red lips shutting over pearls,  Bare feet, white and wet with dew,  Two eyes black, and two eyes blue;  Little girl and boy were they,  Katie Lee and Willie Grey.    They were standing where a brook,  Bending like a shepherd's crook,  Flashed its silver, and thick ranks  Of willow fringed its mossy banks;  Half in thought, and half in play,  Katie Lee and Willie Grey.    They had cheeks like cherries red;  He was taller--'most a head;  She, with arms like wreaths of snow,  Swung a basket to and fro  As she loitered, half in play,  Chattering to Willie Grey.    \"Pretty Katie,\" Willie said--  And there came a dash of red  Through the brownness of his cheek--  \"Boys are strong and girls are weak,  And I'll carry, so I will,  Katie's basket up the hill.\"    Katie answered with a laugh,  \"You shall carry only half\";  And then, tossing back her curls,  \"Boys are weak as well as girls.\"  Do you think that Katie guessed  Half the wisdom she expressed?    Men are only boys grown tall;  Hearts don't change much, after all;  And when, long years from that day,  Katie Lee and Willie Grey  Stood again beside the brook,  Bending like a shepherd's crook,--    Is it strange that Willie said,  While again a dash of red  Crossed the brownness of his cheek,  \"I am strong and you are weak;  Life is but a slippery steep,  Hung with shadows cold and deep.    \"Will you trust me, Katie dear,--  Walk beside me without fear?  May I carry, if I will,  All your burdens up the hill?\"  And she answered, with a laugh,  \"No, but you may carry half.\"    Close beside the little brook,  Bending like a shepherd's crook,  Washing with its silver hands  Late and early at the sands,  Is a cottage, where to-day  Katie lives with Willie Grey.    In a porch she sits, and lo!  Swings a basket to and fro--  Vastly different from the one  That she swung in years agone,  _This_ is long and deep and wide,  And has--_rockers at the side_.            Abou Ben Adhem      Abou Ben Adhem--may his tribe increase!--  Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,  And saw, within the moonlight in his room,  Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,  An angel, writing in a book of gold.  Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,  And to the Presence in the room he said,  \"What writest thou?\" The vision raised its head,  And, with a look made all of sweet accord,  Answered, \"The names of those who love the Lord.\"  \"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so,\"  Replied the angel.--Abou spoke more low,  But cheerily still; and said, \"I pray thee, then,  Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.\"    The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night  It came again, with a great wakening light,  And showed the names whom love of God had blessed:  And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.        _Leigh Hunt._          In School-Days      Still sits the school-house by the road,    A ragged beggar sunning;  Around it still the sumachs grow,    And blackberry vines are running.    Within, the master's desk is seen,    Deep scarred by raps official;  The warping floor, the battered seats,    The jack-knife's carved initial;    The charcoal frescoes on its wall;    Its door's worn sill, betraying  The feet that, creeping slow to school,    Went storming out to playing!    Long years ago a winter sun    Shone over it at setting;  Lit up its western window-panes,    And low eaves' icy fretting.    It touched the tangled golden curls,    And brown eyes full of grieving,  Of one who still her steps delayed    When all the school were leaving.    For near her stood the little boy    Her childish favor singled:  His cap pulled low upon a face    Where pride and shame were mingled.    Pushing with restless feet the snow    To right and left, he lingered;--  As restlessly her tiny hands    The blue-checked apron fingered.    He saw her lift her eyes; he felt    The soft hand's light caressing,  And heard the tremble of her voice,    As if a fault confessing.    \"I'm sorry that I spelt"]]]
