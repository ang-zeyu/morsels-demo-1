The sound is like a river  between steep, rocky shores, but in the mouth of every valley, and  wherever the margin of the shore is flat, stand white villas and  mansions, villages, walls and ruins, gardens and groves. The Bosporus is  barely twenty miles long. In some places its breadth is less than a  third of a mile, in others two-thirds. Old plane-trees spread their  crowns over fresh meadows, and laurels, chestnuts, walnuts, and oaks  afford deep shade. White dolphins skim along the water, and a school of  porpoises follows in the wake of the boat, waiting for the refuse from  the cook's galley. They are dark, soft, and smooth, their backs shining  like metal, and they can easily be seen several feet below the surface.  A single flap of the tail fin gives them a tremendous impulse, and they  come up to the surface like arrows discharged by the gods of the sea,  and describe beautiful somersaults among the waves. They could easily  overtake us if they liked, but they content themselves with following  close behind us hour after hour.    To the left we have the European coast, to the right the Asiatic. The  distance is always so small that the Europeans can hear the bark of the  Asiatic dogs. Here is Terapia, with the summer villas of Christians and  the ambassadors' palaces. Turkish coffee-houses are erected on the  shore, and their balconies hang over the water. Farther on there is a  large valley with an ancient plane-tree with seven trunks which are  called \"the seven brothers.\" According to tradition Godfrey de Bouillon  with his crusaders reposed under its shade in the winter of 1096-1097,  when he marched to recover the holy sepulchre and win the sounding title  of \"King of Jerusalem.\"    Now the channel widens out and the coasts of the two continents diverge  from each other. We see the horizon of the Black Sea opening before us,  and the vessel begins to pitch. Lighthouses stand on either side of the  entrance, which is commanded by batteries high above it. We roll out  into the sea, and half an hour later we can hardly see the break in the  coast-line which marks the end of the Bosporus.    We make straight for Sebastopol, near the southernmost point of the  Crimea. This is the station of the Russian Black Sea fleet, but the  Russians have little pride in it, for the Turks control the passage to  the Mediterranean, and without the consent of the other great Powers the  Russian warships cannot pass through. The Black Sea is, of course, open  to the mercantile vessels of all nations.    You know, of course, that Europe has four landlocked seas, the Baltic,  the Mediterranean, the Black and Caspian Seas. The Baltic is enclosed  all round by European coasts; the Black and Caspian Seas belong to both  Europe and Asia; while the Mediterranean lies between the three  continents of the Old World--Europe, Asia, and Africa. Now the Baltic,  Black, and Caspian Seas are of about the same size, each having an area  about three times that of England and Wales. The Baltic is connected  with the Atlantic by several sounds between the Danish islands and  Scania. The Black Sea has only one outlet, the Bosporus. The Caspian Sea  has no outlet at all, and is really a lake.    The Baltic is very shallow, its maximum depth, south-east of the  Landsort lighthouse, being 250 fathoms. Next comes the Caspian Sea with  a depth of 600 fathoms. The singular feature of this, the largest lake  in the world, is that its surface lies 85 feet below that of the Black  Sea. This last is the deepest of the three, for in it a sounding of 1230  fathoms has been taken.    All three seas are salt, the Baltic least and the Caspian most. Four  great rivers enter the Black Sea, the Danube, Dniester, Dnieper, and  Don. It therefore receives large volumes of fresh water. But along the  bottom of the Bosporus an undercurrent of salt water passes into the  Black Sea, which is compensated for by a surface stream of less salt and  therefore lighter water flowing to the Mediterranean.    The Black Sea is not blacker than any other sea, nor is the White Sea  white, the Yellow Sea yellow, or the Red Sea red. And so no faith should  be accorded to the story of a captain in the Mediterranean who wished to  sail to the Red Sea but went to the Black Sea--because he was  colour-blind!    But now we can continue our heaving course, still accompanied by  dolphins and porpoises. We look in at the harbour of Sebastopol, we  anchor in open roadsteads off Caucasian towns, we moor our cables to the  rings on the quay of Batum, and finally drop our anchor for the last  time at a short distance from the coast of Asia Minor.    Proud and bright, with forest-clad heights in the background, Trebizond  bathes in the rays of the midday sun. Small rowing-boats come out from  the land to take passengers and goods to the quay. The Turkish boatmen  scream all together, but no one listens to them. Every one is glad to be  landed safe and sound with his baggage.      TREBIZOND TO TEHERAN    Trebizond was a Greek colony seven hundred years before the birth of  Christ, and from time immemorial Persian trade has made its way to the  Black Sea by the road which still runs through Tabriz to Teheran, a  distance of 800 miles. This traffic is now on the decline, for modern  means of communication have taken the place of the old caravans, and  most of their trade has been diverted to the Suez Canal and the  Caucasian railways. Many large caravans, however, still journey to and  fro along this road, which is so well made that one can drive not only  to Tabriz, but still further to Teheran. It may, indeed, be softened by  autumn rains or frozen hard on the high plateaus of Turkish Armenia, and  the speed is not great when the same horses have to be used for  distances of 160 miles.    It was a lively cavalcade that pounded and rattled over the Turkish and  Persian roads in November, 1905. I was by no means alone. The Governors  of Trebizond and Erzerum were so good as to provide me with an escort of  six armed troopers on sturdy horses. In front rides a Turkish soldier on  a piebald horse, carrying his carbine in a sling over his back, his  sabre and dagger hanging at his side, and wearing a red fez with a white  _pagri_[5] wound round it as a protection from sun and wind. Then I come  in my carriage, drawn by three horses. Old Shakir, the coachman, is  already my friend; it is he who prepares my meals and looks after me  generally. I am well wrapped up in a Caucasian cloak, with a  _bashlik_[6] over my cap, and lean back comfortably and look at the  country as we drive along. Behind the carriage ride two soldiers on  brown horses, engaged in a lively conversation and wondering whether  they will be well tipped. Then come two clumsy carts, on which all my  baggage is firmly secured. They have their own drivers and men, and are  escorted by three troopers.    In this manner I travelled from Trebizond to Teheran. To the ceaseless  rattle of the wheels and the heavy tramp of the horses' hoofs, I plunged  day by day deeper into Asia. Soon the blue expanse of the Black Sea  passed out of sight, as the road with many steep and sudden bends wound  up to the top of a pass. On the other side it descended with as many  windings to the bottom of a valley. And thus we went up and down till we  were up at length on the level Armenian tableland.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING (_a_) JOURNEY FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TO TEHERAN  (pp. 26-33); (_b_) LATTER PART OF JOURNEY TO BAKU (pp. 34-35); AND (_c_)  JOURNEY FROM BAKU ACROSS PERSIA TO BAGHDAD AND BACK TO TEHERAN (pp.  37-45).]    Here there is a complete change. During the first days after leaving the  coast, we had driven through a beautiful and constantly changing  landscape. We had passed through woods of coniferous trees and among  rustling foliage of yellow leaves. Sometimes we had been hundreds of  feet above an abyss, at the foot of which a bluish-green stream foamed  between rounded rocks. Beside the road we had seen rows of villages and  farms, with houses and verandahs of wood, where Turks sat comfortably in  their shops and cafes; and we had met many small caravans of horses,  asses, and oxen carrying hay, fruit, and bricks between the villages. We  always began our day's march in the early morning, for the nights were  mild and the sun had scarcely risen before it felt pleasant.    But up here on the plateau it is different. No firs adorn the mountain  flanks, no foliaged trees throw their shade over the road. No creaking  carts, laden with timber and drawn by buffaloes and oxen, enliven the  way. The villages are scattered, and the houses are low cabins of stone  or sun-dried clay. The Turkish population is blended with Armenians. The  road becomes worse and more neglected as the traffic falls off. The air  is cool, and there are several degrees of frost in the night.    When we have passed Erzerum, where the Christian churches of the  Armenians stand side by side with the mosques of the Turks, we journey,  as it were, on a flat roof sloping down slightly on three sides, each  with a gutter leading into its own water-butt. These water-butts are the  Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Persian Gulf, and they are always  big enough to hold all the water, however hard it may rain on the stony  roof which rises between Caucasia, Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia. The  gutters are, of course, the rivers, the greatest of which is the  Euphrates.    Now the road is very bad. There has been rain in the autumn; and now  that it is freezing, the mud, all cut up by deep wheel-ruts, is as hard  as stone. My vehicle shakes and jolts me hither and thither and up and  down, and when we arrive at the village where we are to pass the night,  I feel bruised all over. Shakir makes tea and boils eggs, and after  supper I roll myself in my cloak and go to sleep.    It is pitch-dark"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#8)"],[1,"green or sky  blue, and roofs rose red or black and white, and walls whitewashed until  they shone in the sun like snow. In the centre of the village stood a  windmill, placed on a little moss-grown slope; it was a landmark to all  the level country round. It had once been painted scarlet, sails and  all; but that had been in its infancy, half a century or more earlier,  when it had ground wheat for the soldiers of Napoleon; and it was now  a ruddy brown, tanned by wind and weather. It went queerly by fits and  starts, as though rheumatic and stiff in the joints from age; but it  served the whole neighborhood, which would have thought it almost  as impious to carry grain elsewhere as to attend any other religious  service than the mass that was performed at the altar of the little old  gray church, with its conical steeple, which stood opposite to it,  and whose single bell rang morning, noon, and night with that strange,  subdued, hollow sadness which every bell that hangs in the Low Countries  seems to gain as an integral part of its melody.    Within sound of the little melancholy clock almost from their birth  upward, they had dwelt together, Nello and Patrasche, in the little hut  on the edge of the village, with the cathedral spire of Antwerp rising  in the northeast, beyond the great green plain of seeding grass and  spreading corn that stretched away from them like a tideless, changeless  sea. It was the hut of a very old man, of a very poor man--of old Jehan  Daas, who in his time had been a soldier, and who remembered the wars  that had trampled the country as oxen tread down the furrows, and who  had brought from his service nothing except a wound, which had made him  a cripple.    When old Jehan Daas had reached his full eighty, his daughter had  died in the Ardennes, hard by Stavelot, and had left him in legacy her  two-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive to support himself,  but he took up the additional burden uncomplainingly, and it soon  became welcome and precious to him. Little Nello, which was but a pet  diminutive for Nicolas, throve with him, and the old man and the little  child lived in the poor little hut contentedly.    It was a very humble little mud hut indeed, but it was clean and white  as a sea-shell, and stood in a small plot of garden ground that yielded  beans and herbs and pumpkins. They were very poor, terribly poor; many a  day they had nothing at all to eat. They never by any chance had enough;  to have had enough to eat would have been to have reached paradise at  once. But the old man was very gentle and good to the boy, and the boy  was a beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-natured creature; and they  were happy on a crust and a few leaves of cabbage, and asked no more of  earth or heaven--save indeed that Patrasche should be always with them,  since without Patrasche where would they have been?    For Patrasche was their alpha and omega; their treasury and granary;  their store of gold and wand of wealth; their bread-winner and minister;  their only friend and comforter. Patrasche dead or gone from them, they  must have laid themselves down and died likewise. Patrasche was body,  brains, hands, head, and feet to both of them; Patrasche was their very  life, their very soul. For Jehan Daas was old and a cripple, and Nello  was but a child; and Patrasche was their dog.    A dog of Flanders--yellow of hide, large of head and limb, with  wolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs bowed and feet widened in the  muscular development wrought in his breed by many generations of hard  service. Patrasche came of a race which had toiled hard and cruelly from  sire to son in Flanders many a century--slaves of slaves, dogs of the  people, beasts of the shafts and the harness, creatures that lived  straining their sinews in the gall of the cart, and died breaking their  hearts on the flints of the streets.    Patrasche had been born of parents who had labored hard all their  days over the sharp-set stones of the various cities and the long,  shadowless, weary roads of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been  born to no other heritage than those of pain and of toil. He had been  fed on curses and baptized with blows. Why not? It was a Christian  country, and Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown he had  known the bitter gall of the cart and the collar. Before he had entered  his thirteenth month he had become the property of a hardware dealer,  who was accustomed to wander over the land north and south, from the  blue sea to the green mountains. They sold him for a small price,  because he was so young.    This man was a drunkard and a brute. The life of Patrasche was a life of  hell. To deal the tortures of hell on the animal creation is a way which  the Christians have of showing their belief in it. His purchaser was  a sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, who heaped his cart full with  pots and pans and flagons and buckets, and other wares of crockery and  brass and tin, and left Patrasche to draw the load as best he might,  while he himself lounged idly by the side in fat and sluggish ease,  smoking his black pipe and stopping at every wineshop or cafe on the  road.    Happily for Patrasche, or unhappily, he was very strong; he came of an  iron race, long born and bred to such cruel travail; so that he did  not die, but managed to drag on a wretched existence under the brutal  burdens, the scarifying lashes, the hunger, the thirst, the blows,  the curses, and the exhaustion which are the only wages with which the  Flemings repay the most patient and laborious of all their four-footed  victims. One day, after two years of this long and deadly agony,  Patrasche was going on as usual along one of the straight, dusty,  unlovely roads that lead to the city of Rubens. It was full midsummer,  and very warm. His cart was very heavy, piled high with goods in  metal and in earthenware. His owner sauntered on without noticing him  otherwise than by the crack of the whip as it curled round his quivering  loins. The Brabantois had paused to drink beer himself at every wayside  house, but he had forbidden Patrasche to stop a moment for a draught  from the canal. Going along thus, in the full sun, on a scorching  highway, having eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, and, which was far  worse to him, not having tasted water for near twelve, being blind with  dust, sore with blows, and stupefied with the merciless weight which  dragged upon his loins, Patrasche staggered and foamed a little at the  mouth, and fell.    He fell in the middle of the white, dusty road, in the full glare of  the sun; he was sick unto death, and motionless. His master gave him the  only medicine in his pharmacy--kicks and oaths and blows with a cudgel  of oak, which had been often the only food and drink, the only wage and  reward, ever offered to him. But Patrasche was beyond the reach of any  torture or of any curses. Patrasche lay, dead to all appearances,  down in the white powder of the summer dust. After a while, finding  it useless to assail his ribs with punishment and his ears with  maledictions, the Brabantois--deeming life gone in him, or going, so  nearly that his carcass was forever useless, unless, indeed, some one  should strip it of the skin for gloves--cursed him fiercely in farewell,  struck off the leathern bands of the harness, kicked his body aside into  the grass, and, groaning and muttering in savage wrath, pushed the cart  lazily along the road uphill, and left the dying dog for the ants to  sting and for the crows to pick.    It was the last day before kermess away at Louvain, and the Brabantois  was in haste to reach the fair and get a good place for his truck of  brass wares. He was in fierce wrath, because Patrasche had been a strong  and much-enduring animal, and because he himself had now the hard task  of pushing his _charette_ all the way to Louvain. But to stay to look  after Patrasche never entered his thoughts; the beast was dying and  useless, and he would steal, to replace him, the first large dog that he  found wandering alone out of sight of its master. Patrasche had cost him  nothing, or next to nothing, and for two long, cruel years he had made  him toil ceaselessly in his service from sunrise to sunset, through  summer and winter, in fair weather and foul.    He had got a fair use and a good profit out of Patrasche; being human,  he was wise, and left the dog to draw his last breath alone in the  ditch, and have his bloodshot eyes plucked out as they might be by the  birds, whilst he himself went on his way to beg and to steal, to eat and  to drink, to dance and to sing, in the mirth at Louvain. A dying dog, a  dog of the cart--why should he waste hours over its agonies at peril of  losing a handful of copper coins, at peril of a shout of laughter?    Patrasche lay there, flung in the grass-green ditch. It was a busy road  that day, and hundreds of people, on foot and on mules, in waggons or  in carts, went by, tramping quickly and joyously on to Louvain. Some saw  him; most did not even look; all passed on. A dead dog more or less--it  was nothing in Brabant; it would be nothing anywhere in the world.    After a time, among the holiday-makers, there came a little old man who  was bent and lame, and very feeble. He was in no guise for feasting; he  was very poorly and miserably clad, and he dragged his silent way slowly  through the dust among the pleasure-seekers. He looked at Patrasche,  paused, wondered, turned aside, then kneeled down in the rank grass and  weeds of the ditch, and surveyed the dog with kindly eyes of pity. There  was with him a little rosy, fair-haired, dark-eyed child of a few years  old, who pattered in amid the bushes, that were for him breast-high,  and stood gazing with a pretty seriousness upon the poor, great, quiet  beast.    Thus it was that these two first met--the little Nello and the big  Patrasche.    The"]]]
