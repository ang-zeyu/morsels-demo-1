The largest of the Cairo fragments now helps us to fill in this  gap in our knowledge.         (1) See Breasted, _Anc. Rec._, I, pp. 52, 57.         (2) Cf. Hall, _Ancient History of the Near East_, p. 99 f.    On the top of the new fragment(1) we meet the same band of rectangles as  at Palermo,(2) but here their upper portions are broken away, and there  only remains at the base of each of them the outlined figure of a royal  personage, seated in the same attitude as those on the Palermo stone.  The remarkable fact about these figures is that, with the apparent  exception of the third figure from the right,(3) each wears, not the  Crown of the North, as at Palermo, but the Crown of the South. We have  then to do with kings of Upper Egypt, not the Delta, and it is no longer  possible to suppose that the predynastic rulers of the Palermo Stele  were confined to those of Lower Egypt, as reflecting northern tradition.  Rulers of both halves of the country are represented, and Monsieur  Gautier has shown,(4) from data on the reverse of the inscription, that  the kings of the Delta were arranged on the original stone before the  rulers of the south who are outlined upon our new fragment. Moreover, we  have now recovered definite proof that this band of the inscription is  concerned with predynastic Egyptian princes; for the cartouche of the  king, whose years are enumerated in the second band immediately below  the kings of the south, reads Athet, a name we may with certainty  identify with Athothes, the second successor of Menes, founder of the  Ist Dynasty, which is already given under the form Ateth in the Abydos  List of Kings.(5) It is thus quite certain that the first band of the  inscription relates to the earlier periods before the two halves of the  country were brought together under a single ruler.         (1) Cairo No. 1; see Gautier, _Mus. Egypt._, III, pl. xxiv       f.         (2) In this upper band the spaces are true rectangles, being       separated by vertical lines, not by the hieroglyph for       \"year\" as in the lower bands; and each rectangle is assigned       to a separate king, and not, as in the other bands, to a       year of a king's reign.         (3) The difference in the crown worn by this figure is       probably only apparent and not intentional; M. Foucart,       after a careful examination of the fragment, concludes that       it is due to subsequent damage or to an original defect in       the stone; cf. _Bulletin_, XII, ii, p. 162.         (4) Op. cit., p. 32 f.         (5) In Manetho's list he corresponds to {Kenkenos}, the       second successor of Menes according to both Africanus and       Eusebius, who assign the name Athothis to the second ruler       of the dynasty only, the Teta of the Abydos List. The form       Athothes is preserved by Eratosthenes for both of Menes'       immediate successors.    Though the tradition of these remote times is here recorded on a  monument of the Vth Dynasty, there is no reason to doubt its general  accuracy, or to suppose that we are dealing with purely mythological  personages. It is perhaps possible, as Monsieur Foucart suggests, that  missing portions of the text may have carried the record back through  purely mythical periods to Ptah and the Creation. In that case we should  have, as we shall see, a striking parallel to early Sumerian tradition.  But in the first extant portions of the Palermo text we are already in  the realm of genuine tradition. The names preserved appear to be those  of individuals, not of mythological creations, and we may assume that  their owners really existed. For though the invention of writing had  not at that time been achieved, its place was probably taken by oral  tradition. We know that with certain tribes of Africa at the present  day, who possess no knowledge of writing, there are functionaries  charged with the duty of preserving tribal traditions, who transmit  orally to their successors a remembrance of past chiefs and some details  of events that occurred centuries before.(1) The predynastic Egyptians  may well have adopted similar means for preserving a remembrance of  their past history.         (1) M. Foucart illustrates this point by citing the case of       the Bushongos, who have in this way preserved a list of no       less than a hundred and twenty-one of their past kings; op.       cit., p. 182, and cf. Tordey and Joyce, \"Les Bushongos\", in       _Annales du Musee du Congo Belge_, ser. III, t. II, fasc. i       (Brussels, 1911).    Moreover, the new text furnishes fresh proof of the general accuracy of  Manetho, even when dealing with traditions of this prehistoric age.  On the stele there is no definite indication that these two sets of  predynastic kings were contemporaneous rulers of Lower and Upper Egypt  respectively; and since elsewhere the lists assign a single sovereign  to each epoch, it has been suggested that we should regard them as  successive representatives of the legitimate kingdom.(1) Now Manetho,  after his dynasties of gods and demi-gods, states that thirty Memphite  kings reigned for 1,790 years, and were followed by ten Thinite kings  whose reigns covered a period of 350 years. Neglecting the figures as  obviously erroneous, we may well admit that the Greek historian here  alludes to our two pre-Menite dynasties. But the fact that he should  regard them as ruling consecutively does not preclude the other  alternative. The modern convention of arranging lines of contemporaneous  rulers in parallel columns had not been evolved in antiquity, and  without some such method of distinction contemporaneous rulers, when  enumerated in a list, can only be registered consecutively. It would be  natural to assume that, before the unification of Egypt by the founder  of the Ist Dynasty, the rulers of North and South were independent  princes, possessing no traditions of a united throne on which any claim  to hegemony could be based. On the assumption that this was so, their  arrangement in a consecutive series would not have deceived their  immediate successors. But it would undoubtedly tend in course of time to  obliterate the tradition of their true order, which even at the period  of the Vth Dynasty may have been completely forgotten. Manetho would  thus have introduced no strange or novel confusion; and this explanation  would of course apply to other sections of his system where the  dynasties he enumerates appear to be too many for their period. But his  reproduction of two lines of predynastic rulers, supported as it now is  by the early evidence of the Palermo text, only serves to increase our  confidence in the general accuracy of his sources, while at the  same time it illustrates very effectively the way in which possible  inaccuracies, deduced from independent data, may have arisen in quite  early times.         (1) Foucart, loc. cit.    In contrast to the dynasties of Manetho, those of Berossus are  so imperfectly preserved that they have never formed the basis of  Babylonian chronology.(1) But here too, in the chronological scheme,  a similar process of reduction has taken place. Certain dynasties,  recovered from native sources and at one time regarded as consecutive,  were proved to have been contemporaneous; and archaeological evidence  suggested that some of the great gaps, so freely assumed in the royal  sequence, had no right to be there. As a result, the succession of known  rulers was thrown into truer perspective, and such gaps as remained were  being partially filled by later discoveries. Among the latter the most  important find was that of an early list of kings, recently published by  Pere Scheil(2) and subsequently purchased by the British Museum shortly  before the war. This had helped us to fill in the gap between the famous  Sargon of Akkad and the later dynasties, but it did not carry us  far beyond Sargon's own time. Our archaeological evidence also comes  suddenly to an end. Thus the earliest picture we have hitherto obtained  of the Sumerians has been that of a race employing an advanced system of  writing and possessed of a knowledge of metal. We have found, in short,  abundant remains of a bronze-age culture, but no traces of preceding  ages of development such as meet us on early Egyptian sites. It was  a natural inference that the advent of the Sumerians in the Euphrates  Valley was sudden, and that they had brought their highly developed  culture with them from some region of Central or Southern Asia.         (1) While the evidence of Herodotus is extraordinarily       valuable for the details he gives of the civilizations of       both Egypt and Babylonia, and is especially full in the case       of the former, it is of little practical use for the       chronology. In Egypt his report of the early history is       confused, and he hardly attempts one for Babylonia. It is       probable that on such subjects he sometimes misunderstood       his informants, the priests, whose traditions were more       accurately reproduced by the later native writers Manetho       and Berossus.

The lists of early kings were themselves drawn up under the Dynasty  of Nisin in the twenty-second century B.C., and they give us traces of  possibly ten and at least eight other \"kingdoms\" before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII.

Mutual jealousy of each  other's growth at the expense of these States gave rise to the theory  of the balance of power; mutual adjustment of each other's disputes  produced international law; and the necessity of watching each other's  designs begat modern diplomacy.[65]                       [Footnote 65: _Cf._ A.O. Meyer, _Die Englische                     Diplomatie_, Breslau, 1901.]    Parallel with these developments in the relations between one State  and another marched a no less momentous revolution in the domestic  position of their sovereigns. National expansion abroad was marked by  a corresponding growth in royal authority at home. The process was not  new in England; every step in the path of the tribal chief of Saxon  pirates to the throne of a united England denoted an advance in the  nature of kingly power. Each extension of his sway intensified his  authority, and his power grew in degree as it increased in area. So  with fifteenth-century sovereigns. Local liberties and feudal rights  which had checked a Duke of Brittany or a King of Aragon were  powerless to restrain the King of France or of Spain. The sphere of  royal authority encroached upon all others; all functions and all  powers tended to concentrate in royal hands. The king was the emblem  of national unity, the centre of national aspirations, and the object  of national reverence. The Renaissance gave fresh impetus to the  movement. Men turned not only to the theology, literature, and art of  the early Christian era; they began to study anew its political  organisation and its system of law and jurisprudence. The code of  Justinian was as much a revelation as the original Greek of the    (p. 032)  New Testament. Roman imperial law seemed as superior to the barbarities  of common law as classical was to mediaeval Latin; and Roman law  supplanted indigenous systems in France and in Germany, in Spain and  in Scotland. Both the Roman imperial law and the Roman imperial  constitution were useful models for kings of the New Monarchy; the  Roman Empire was a despotism; _quod principi placuit legis habet  vigorem_ ran the fundamental principle of Roman Empire.[66] Nor was  this all; Roman emperors were habitually deified, and men in the  sixteenth century seemed to pay to their kings while alive the Divine  honours which Romans paid to their emperors when dead. \"Le nouveau  Messie,\" says Michelet, \"est le roi.\"[67]                       [Footnote 66: The conclusion of the maxim _utpote                     cum lege regia quae de imperio ejus lata est,                     populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et                     potestatem conferat_ (Ulpian, _Digest_, I., iv.,                     1), was conveniently forgotten by apologists for                     absolutism, though the Tudors respected it in                     practice.]                       [Footnote 67: _Hist. de France_, ed. 1879, ix.,                     301.]    Nowhere was the king more emphatically the saviour of society than in  England. The sixty years of Lancastrian rule were in the seventeenth  century represented as the golden age of parliamentary government, a  sort of time before the fall to which popular orators appealed when  they wished to paint in vivid colours the evils of Stuart tyranny. But  to keen observers of the time the pre-eminent characteristic of  Lancastrian rule appeared to be its \"lack of governance\" or, in modern  phrase, administrative anarchy.[68] There was no subordination in the  State. The weakness of the Lancastrian title left the king at the  mercy of Parliament, and the limitations of Parliament were never  (p. 033)  more apparent than when its powers stood highest. Even in the realm of  legislation, the statute book has seldom been so barren. Its principal  acts were to narrow the county electorate to an oligarchy, to restrict  the choice of constituencies to resident knights and burgesses, and to  impair its own influence as a focus of public opinion. It was not  content with legislative authority; it interfered with an executive  which it could hamper but could not control. It was possessed by the  inveterate fallacy that freedom and strong government are things  incompatible; that the executive is the natural enemy of the Legislature;  that if one is strong, the other must be weak; and of the two  alternatives it vastly preferred a weak executive. So, to limit the  king's power, it sought to make him \"live of his own,\" when \"his own\"  was absolutely inadequate to meet the barest necessities of government.  Parliament was in fact irresponsible; the connecting link between it  and the executive had yet to be found. Hence the Lancastrian \"lack of  governance\"; it ended in a generation of civil war, and the memory of  that anarchy explains much in Tudor history.                       [Footnote 68: Fortescue, _Governance of England_,                     ed. Plummer, 1885.]    The problems of Henry VIII.'s reign can indeed only be solved by  realising the misrule of the preceding century, the failure of  parliamentary government, and the strength of the popular demand for a  firm and masterful hand. It is a modern myth that Englishmen have  always been consumed with enthusiasm for parliamentary government and  with a thirst for a parliamentary vote. The interpretation of history,  like that of the Scriptures, varies from age to age; and present  political theories colour our views of the past. The political  development of the nineteenth century created a parliamentary legend;  and civil and religious liberty became the inseparable stage       (p. 034)  properties of the Englishman. Whenever he appeared on the boards, he  was made to declaim about the rights of the subject and the privileges  of Parliament. It was assumed that the desire for a voice in the  management of his own affairs had at all times and all seasons been  the mainspring of his actions; and so the story of Henry's rule was  made into a political mystery. In reality, love of freedom has not  always been, nor will it always remain, the predominant note in the  English mind. At times the English people have pursued it through  battle and murder with grim determination, but other times have seen  other ideals. On occasion the demand has been for strong government  irrespective of its methods, and good government has been preferred to  self-government. Wars of expansion and wars of defence have often  cooled the love of liberty and impaired the faith in parliaments; and  generally English ideals have been strictly subordinated to a passion  for material prosperity.    Never was this more apparent than under the Tudors. The parliamentary  experiment of the Lancastrians was premature and had failed.  Parliamentary institutions were discredited and people were  indifferent to parliamentary rights and privileges: \"A plague on both  your Houses,\" was the popular feeling, \"give us peace, above all peace  at home to pursue new avenues of wealth, new phases of commercial  development, peace to study new problems of literature, religion, and  art\"; and both Houses passed out of the range of popular imagination,  and almost out of the sphere of independent political action.  Parliament played during the sixteenth century a modester part than it  had played since its creation. Towards the close of the period     (p. 035)  Shakespeare wrote his play of _King John_, and in that play there is  not the faintest allusion to Magna Carta.[69] Such an omission would  be inconceivable now or at any time since the death of Elizabeth; for  the Great Charter is enshrined in popular imagination as the palladium  of the British constitution. It was the fetish to which Parliament  appealed against the Stuarts. But no such appeal would have touched a  Tudor audience. It needed and desired no weapon against a sovereign  who embodied national desires, and ruled in accord with the national  will. References to the charter are as rare in parliamentary debates  as they are in the pages of Shakespeare. The best hated instruments of  Stuart tyranny were popular institutions under the Tudors; and the  Star Chamber itself found its main difficulty in the number of suitors  which flocked to a court where the king was judge, the law's delays  minimised, counsel's fees moderate, and justice rarely denied merely  because it might happen to be illegal. England in the sixteenth  century put its trust in its princes far more than it did in its  parliaments; it invested them with attributes almost Divine. By Tudor  majesty the poet was inspired with thoughts of the divinity that doth  hedge a king. \"Love for the King,\" wrote a Venetian of Henry VIII. in  the early years of his reign, \"is universal with all who see him, for  his Highness does not seem a person of this world, but one         (p. 036)  descended from heaven.\"[70] _Le nouveau Messie est le Roi._                       [Footnote 69: Magna Carta may almost be said to                     have been \"discovered\" by the parliamentary                     opponents of the Stuarts; and in discovering it,                     they misinterpreted several of its clauses such as                     the _judicium parium_. Allusion was, however, made                     to Magna Carta in the proceedings against Wolsey                     for _Praemunire_ (Fox, vi., 43).]                       [Footnote 70: _Ven Cal._, ii., 336.]    Such were the tendencies which Henry VII. and Henry VIII. crystallised  into practical weapons of absolute government. Few kings have attained  a greater measure of permanent success than the first of the Tudors;  it was he who laid the unseen foundations upon which Henry VIII.  erected the imposing edifice of his personal authority. An orphan from  birth and an exile from childhood, he stood near enough to the throne  to "]]]
