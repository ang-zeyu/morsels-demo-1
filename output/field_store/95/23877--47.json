[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20666"],[0,"The Debs Decision (#8)"],[1,"United States.    I have seen the Supreme Court and I have seen Eugene V. Debs. From the  Supreme Court I got neither love nor inspiration; from Debs I got both.    In his generation in the United States, there is not a greater man than  Eugene V. Debs--not because of what he has done, but because of what he  is, and when the history of this generation is written, that fact will  be recorded.    The masters in all ages have put men like Debs in jail because it is the  truth-teller that the masters fear most. They fear the Truth; they fear  the Light; they fear Justice; and the man who turns on the Light and  speaks the Truth and cries out for Justice--is their greatest enemy. So  they have always tried this process of putting ideas into jail.      9. PUTTING IDEAS IN JAIL    Years ago, when the Mexican War was being fought, an American named  Henry D. Thoreau refused to pay his war tax. He did not believe in the  war and he refused to support the Government that prosecuted the war. So  they put Thoreau in jail. Later he wrote about his experience:    \"As I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet  thick, and the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating  which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the  foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh  and blood and bones, to be locked up....    \"I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax....    \"I could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on  my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hindrance,  and they were really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me,  they had resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come  at some person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog.    \"I saw that the State was half-witted, that it was timid as a lone  woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its friends from  its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and pitied it.    \"Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a  just man is also a prison. The proper place today, the only place which  Massachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits, is  in her prisons, to be put out and locked out of the State by her own  act, as they have already put themselves out by their principles. It is  there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and  the Indian come to plead the wrongs of his race, should find them; on  that separate but more free and honorable ground, where the State places  those who are not with her but against her--the only house in a slave  State on which a free man can abide with honor.    \"If any think that their influence would be lost there, and their voices  no longer afflict the ear of the State, that they would not be as an  enemy within its walls, they do not know by how much truth is stronger  than error, nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat  injustice who has experienced a little in his own person.    \"There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State  comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power,  from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him  accordingly.\"      10. THE SUPREME COURT COULD NOT SAVE SLAVERY    Once before the Supreme Court of the United States tried to save a  decaying social institution--the institution of Slavery. There was a  slave named Dred Scott. He was owned by a resident of Missouri. He was  taken into Minnesota and into Illinois. Illinois was a free State by its  own laws. Minnesota was free by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Then  his master took Dred Scott back to Missouri, and there Dred Scott tried  to gain his freedom. The case was finally decided by the Supreme Court  of the United States in 1857.    The Supreme Court held (two justices dissenting) that Scott could not  sue in the lower courts because he was not a citizen and, therefore, was  not entitled to any standing in the courts; that at the time of the  formation of the Constitution, negroes descended from negro slaves were  not and could not be citizens in any of the States; and that there was  no power in the existing form of Government to make citizens of such  persons. In the course of his decision, Judge Taney used the following  language:    \"It is difficult, at this day, to realize the state of public opinion  which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world  at the time of the Declaration of Independence, and when the  Constitution was framed and adopted in relation to that unfortunate  race. But the public history of every European nation displays it in a  manner too plain to be mistaken. They had for more than a century before  been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to  associate with the white race, either in social or political relations;  and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was  bound to respect, and that the negro might justly and lawfully be  reduced to slavery for his benefit. He has been bought and sold and  treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic, whenever a  profit could be made by it. The opinion was at that time fixed and  universal in the civilized portion of the white race.\"    The Chief Justice went farther than the point at issue warranted, and  stated that the power of Congress to govern territory was subordinate to  its obligation to protect private rights in property and that slaves  were property and as such were protected by the constitutional  guarantees; that Congress had no power to prohibit the citizens of any  State to carry into any territory slaves or any other property, and that  Congress had no power to impair the constitutional protection of such  property while thus held in a territory.    The Dred Scott decision fastened Slavery forever upon the United States.  Slavery lasted just six years.      11. MORE PATCH WORK!    At the present time, Capitalism is tottering to its downfall. The world  is in chaos and revolution. The Supreme Court has handed down a decision  which ostensibly will assist in preserving established order, but the  United States is a Capitalist nation and, as Mr. Wilson himself has so  admirably put it:    \"The masters of the Government of the United States are the combined  capitalists and manufacturers of the United States.\" (\"New Freedom,\"  page 57.)    Capitalism is disappearing from Europe--Russia, Germany, Austria,  Bohemia, Hungary--the list is growing from week to week. When the  President came back on his little visit to America there was one new  thing that he said, and only one new thing:    \"The men who are in conference in Paris realize as keenly as any  Americans can realize that they are not the masters of their people.\"  (Boston, February 24th, 1919.)    \"When I speak of the nations of the world, I do not speak of the  governments of the world. I speak of the peoples who constitute the  nations of the world. They are in the saddle, and they are going to see  to it that if present governments do not do their will, some other  government shall, and the secret is out and the present governments know  it.\" (Boston, February 24th.)    \"I want to utter this solemn warning, not in the way of a threat; the  forces of the world do not threaten, they operate. The great tides of  the world do not give notice that they are going to rise and run; they  rise in their majesticity and overwhelming might and they who stand in  the way are overwhelmed. Now the heart of the world is awake and the  heart of the world must be satisfied. Do not let yourselves suppose for  a moment that the uneasiness in the populations of Europe is due  entirely to economic causes and economic motives; something very much  deeper underlies it all than that. They see that their governments have  never been able to defend them against intrigue or aggression, and that  there is no force of foresight or of prudence in any modern cabinet to  stop war.\" (New York, March 4th, 1919.)    Then comes Mr. Wm. Allen White on the 11th of March with a similar  statement. On the next day comes Mr. Lansing with the statement that  unless something is done and done quickly, the capitalist system in  Europe will be overthrown. The world is in chaos. The fabric of  civilization is threatened. The health and happiness--the very life of  the world--is threatened.    And those who speak particularly of those things; those who are seeking  to warn, to prepare the people; those who attempt to preach law and  order; who oppose war; who believe in peace--those who are attempting to  serve the interests of humanity--go to jail for ten years.    The highest authority in the United States has served notice on the  American people that from it they can hope for nothing in the way of  preservation of their liberties. Their liberties are dead. Well may  those Americans who still have in their souls a spark of the old fire,  turn back 143 years and read these words from the Declaration of  Independence:    \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable  rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that  whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is  the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new  government, laying its foundations on such principles, and organizing  its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect  their safety and happiness.\"             *       *       *       *       *          THE RAND SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE          Local Department                Correspondence Dept.      Full-Time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2069"],[0,"The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria (#8)"],[1,"in Niffur and other less  important shrines, the Assyrians sometimes name Beltu the spouse of  Assur, their national god, suggesting an identification, in the minds  of the priests, with that deity.                              Enu-restu or Nirig.[1]    Whether /Enu-restu/ be a translation of /Nirig/ or not, is uncertain,  but not improbable, the meaning being \"primeval lord,\" or something  similar, and \"lord\" that of the first element, /ni/, in the Sumerian  form. In support of this reading and rendering may be quoted the fact,  that one of the descriptions of this divinity is /assarid ilani  ahe-su/, \"the eldest of the gods his brothers.\" It is noteworthy that  this deity was a special favourite among the Assyrians, many of whose  kings, to say nothing of private persons, bore his name as a component  part of theirs. In the bilingual poem entitled /Ana-kime gimma/  (\"Formed like Anu\"), he is described as being the son of Bel (hence  his appearance after Bel in the list printed above), and in the  likeness of Anu, for which reason, perhaps, his divinity is called  \"Anuship.\" Beginning with words praising him, it seems to refer to his  attitude towards the gods of hostile lands, against whom, apparently,  he rode in a chariot of the sacred lapis-lazuli. Anu having endowed  him with terrible glory, the gods of the earth feared to attack him,  and his onrush was as that of a storm-flood. By the command of Bel,  his course was directed towards E-kur, the temple of Bel at Niffur.  Here he was met by Nusku, the supreme messenger of Bel, who, with  words of respect and of praise, asks him not to disturb the god Bel,  his father, in his seat, nor make the gods of the earth tremble in  Upsukennaku (the heavenly festival-hall of the gods), and offers him a  gift.[2] It will thus be seen that Enu-restu was a rival to the older  Bel, whose temple was the great tower in stages called E-kura, in  which, in all probability, E-su-me-du, the shrine of Enu-restu, was  likewise situated. The inscriptions call him \"god of war,\" though,  unlike Nergal, he was not at the same time god of disease and  pestilence. To all appearance he was the god of the various kinds of  stones, of which another legend states that he \"determined their  fate.\" He was \"the hero, whose net overthrows the enemy, who summons  his army to plunder the hostile land, the royal son who caused his  father to bow down to him from afar.\" \"The son who sat not with the  nurse, and eschewed(?) the strength of milk,\" \"the offspring who did  not know his father.\" \"He rode over the mountains and scattered  seed--unanimously the plants proclaimed his name to their dominion,  among them like a great wild bull he raises his horns.\"    [1] /Enu-restu/ is the reading which I have adopted as the Semitic      Babylonian equivalent of the name of this divinity, in consequence      of the Aramaic transcription given by certain contract-tablets      discovered by the American expedition to Niffer, and published by      Prof. Clay of Philadelphia.    [2] The result of this request is not known, in consequence of the      defective state of the tablets.    Many other interesting descriptions of the deity Nirig (generally read  Nin-ip) occur, and show, with those quoted here, that his story was  one of more than ordinary interest.                                      Nusku.    This deity was especially invoked by the Assyrian kings, but was in no  wise exclusively Assyrian, as is shown by the fact that his name  occurs in many Babylonian inscriptions. He was the great messenger of  the gods, and is variously given as \"the offspring of the abyss, the  creation of Ea,\" and \"the likeness of his father, the first-born of  Bel.\" As Gibil, the fire-god, has likewise the same diverse parentage,  it is regarded as likely that these two gods were identical. Nusku was  the god whose command is supreme, the counsellor of the great gods,  the protector of the Igigi (the gods of the heavens), the great and  powerful one, the glorious day, the burning one, the founder of  cities, the renewer of sanctuaries, the provider of feasts for all the  Igigi, without whom no feast took place in E-kura. Like Nebo, he bore  the glorious spectre, and it was said of him that he attacked mightily  in battle. Without him the sun-god, the judge, could not give  judgment.    All this points to the probability, that Nusku may not have been the  fire-god, but the brother of the fire-god, i.e. either flame, or the  light of fire. The sun-god, without light, could not see, and  therefore could not give judgment: no feast could be prepared without  fire and its flame. As the evidence of the presence of the shining  orbs in the heavens--the light of their fires--he was the messenger of  the gods, and was honoured accordingly. From this idea, too, he became  their messenger in general, especially of Bel-Merodach, the younger  Bel, whose requests he carried to the god Ea in the Deep. In one  inscription he is identified with Nirig or Enu-restu, who is described  above.                                    Merodach.    Concerning this god, and how he arose to the position of king of all  the gods of heaven, has been fully shown in chapter III. Though there  is but little in his attributes to indicate any connection with Samas,  there is hardly any doubt that he was originally a sun-god, as is  shown by the etymology of his name. The form, as it has been handed  down to us, is somewhat shortened, the original pronunciation having  been /Amar-uduk/, \"the young steer of day,\" a name which suggests that  he was the morning sun. Of the four names given at the end of chapter  III., two--\"lord of Babylon,\" and \"lord god of heaven and earth,\"--may  be regarded as expressing his more well-known attributes. /En-ab-sar-u/,  however, is a provisional, though not impossible, reading and  rendering, and if correct, the \"36,000 wild bulls\" would be a  metaphorical way of speaking of \"the 36,000 heroes,\" probably meaning  the gods of heaven in all their grades. The signification of  /En-bilulu/ is unknown. Like most of the other gods of the Babylonian  pantheon, however, Merodach had many other names, among which may be  mentioned /Asari/, which has been compared with the Egyptian Osiris,  /Asari-lu-duga/, \"/Asari/ who is good,\" compared with Osiris Unnefer;  /Namtila/, \"life\", /Tutu/, \"begetter (of the gods), renewer (of the  gods),\" /Sar-azaga/, \"the glorious incantation,\" /Mu-azaga/, \"the  glorious charm,\" and many others. The last two refer to his being the  god who, by his kindness, obtained from his father Ea, dwelling in the  abyss, those charms and incantations which benefited mankind, and  restored the sick to health. In this connection, a frequent title  given to him is \"the merciful one,\" but most merciful was he in that  he spared the lives of the gods who, having sided with Taiwath, were  his enemies, as is related in the tablet of the fifty-one names. In  connection with the fight he bore also the names, \"annihilator of the  enemy,\" \"rooter out of all evil,\" \"troubler of the evil ones,\" \"life  of the whole of the gods.\" From these names it is clear that Merodach,  in defeating Tiawath, annihilated, at the same time, the spirit of  evil, Satan, the accuser, of which she was, probably, the Babylonian  type. But unlike the Saviour in the Christian creed, he saved not only  man, at that time uncreated, but the gods of heaven also. As \"king of  the heavens,\" he was identified with the largest of the planets,  Jupiter, as well as with other heavenly bodies. Traversing the sky in  great zigzags, Jupiter seemed to the Babylonians to superintend the  stars, and this was regarded as emblematic of Merodach shepherding  them--\"pasturing the gods like sheep,\" as the tablet has it.    A long list of gods gives as it were the court of Merodach, held in  what was apparently a heavenly /E-sagila/, and among the spiritual  beings mentioned are /Mina-ikul-beli/ and /Mina-isti-beli/, \"what my  lord has eaten,\" and \"what has my lord drunk,\" /Nadin-me-gati/, \"he  who gives water for the hands,\" also the two door-keepers, and the  four dogs of Merodach, wherein people are inclined to see the four  satellites of Jupiter, which, it is thought, were probably visible to  certain of the more sharp-sighted stargazers of ancient Babylonia.  These dogs were called /Ukkumu/, /Akkulu/, /Ikssuda/, and /Iltebu/,  \"Seizer,\" \"Eater,\" \"Grasper,\" and \"Holder.\" Images of these beings  were probably kept in the temple of E-sagila at Babylon.                                   Zer-panitum.    This was the name of the consort of Merodach, and is generally read  Sarp(b)anitum--a transcription which is against the native orthography  and etymology, namely, \"seed-creatress\" (Zer-banitum). The meaning  attributed to this word is partly confirmed by another name which  Lehmann has pointed out that she possessed, namely, /Erua/ or /Aru'a/,  who, in an inscription of Antiochus Soter (280-260 B.C.) is called  \"the queen who produces birth,\" but more especially by the  circumstance, that she must be identical with Aruru, who created the  seed of mankind along with Merodach. Why she was called \"the lady of  the abyss,\" and elsewhere \"the voice of the abyss\" (/Me-abzu/) is not  known. Zer-panitum was no mere reflection of Merodach, but one of the  most important goddesses in the Babylonian pantheon. The tendency of  scholars has been to identify her with the moon, Merodach being a  solar deity and the meaning \"silvery\"--/Sarpanitum/, from /sarpu/, one  of the words for \"silver,\" was regarded as supporting this idea. She  was identified with the Elamite goddess named Elagu, and with the  Lahamum of the island of Bahrein, the Babylonian Tilmun.                                Nebo and Tasmetum.    As \"the teacher\" and \"the hearer\" these were among the most popular of  the deities of Babylonia and Assyria. Nebo (in Semitic Babylonian  Nabu) was worshipped at the temple-tower"]]]
