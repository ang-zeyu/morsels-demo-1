In the large hut, which is occasionally more luxurious and made of slabs  of wood or of rough boards, if a saw-mill is within reasonable distance,  and there is a passable wood road, or creek, or rivulet, navigable by  canoes, you see some barrel or two of pork, and of flour, or biscuit, or  whiskey, some tools, and some old blankets or skins. Here you are in the  lumberer's winter home--I cannot call him woodman, it would disgrace the  ancient and ballad-sung craft; for the lumberer is not a gentle woodman,  and you need not sing sweetly to him to \"spare that tree.\"    The larger dwelling is the hall, the common hall, and the pig-sties the  sleeping-places. I presume that such a circumstance as pulling off  habiliments or ablution seldom occurs; they roll themselves in a blanket  or skin, if they have one, and, as to water, they are so frequently in  it during the summer, that I suppose they wash half the year  unintentionally. Fat pork, the fattest of the fat, is the lumberer's  luxury; and, as he has the universal rifle or fowling-piece, he kills a  partridge, a bear, or a deer, now and then.    I was exploring last year some woods in a newly settled township, the  township of Seymour West, in the Newcastle district of Upper Canada,  with a view to see the nakedness of the land, which had been represented  to me as flowing with milk and honey, as all new settlements of course  are said to do. I wandered into the lonely but beautiful forest, with a  companion who owned the soil, and who had told me that the lumberers  were robbing him and every settler around of their best pine timber.  After some toiling and tracing the sound of the axes, few and far  between, felling in the distance, we came upon the unvarying boy at  cookery, the axe, and the dog.    My conductor at once saw the extent of the mischief going on, and,  finding that the gang, although distant from the camp-fire, was  numerous, advised that we should retrace our steps. We however  interrogated the boy, who would scarcely answer, and pretended to know  nothing. The dog began to be inquisitive too, and one of the dogs we had  with us venturing a little too near a savoury piece of pork, the nature  of the young half-bred ruffian suddenly blazed out, and the axe was  uplifted to kill poor Dash. I happened to have a good stick, and  interfered to prevent dog-murder, upon which the wood-demon ejaculated  that he would as soon let out my guts as the dog's, and therefore my  companion had to show his gun; for showing his teeth would have been of  little avail with the young savage.    The settlers are afraid of the lumberers; and thus all the finest land,  near rivers, creeks, or transport of any kind, is swept of the timber to  such an extent that you must go now far, far back from the Lakes, the  St. Lawrence, or the Ottawa, before you can see the forest in its  primeval grandeur.    This robbery has been carried on in so barefaced and extensive a manner,  that the chief adventurer, usually a merchant or trader, who supplies  the axe and canoemen with pay in his shop goods, cent. per cent. above  their value, becomes enriched.    The lumberer's life is truly an unhappy one, for, when he reaches the  end of the raft's voyage, whatever money he may have made goes to the  fiddle, the female, or the fire-water; and he starts again as poor as at  first, living perhaps by a rare chance to the advanced age, for a  lumberer, of forty years.    And a curious sight is a raft, joined together not with ropes but with  the limbs and thews of the swamp or blue beech, which is the natural  cordage of Canada and is used for scaffolding and packing.    A raft a quarter of a mile long--I hope I do not exaggerate, for it may  be half a mile, never having measured one but by the eye--with its  little huts of boards, its apologies for flags and streamers, its  numerous little masts and sails, its cooking caboose, and its  contrivances for anchoring and catching the wind by slanting boards,  with the men who appear on its surface as if they were walking on the  lake, is curious enough; but to see it in _drams_, or detached portions,  sent down foaming and darting along the timber slides of the Ottawa or  the restless and rapid Trent, is still more so; and fearful it is to  observe its _conducteur_, who looks in the rapid by no means so much at  his ease as the functionary of that name to whom the Paris diligence is  entrusted.    Numberless accidents happen; the drams are torn to pieces by the  violence of the stream; the rafts are broken by storm and tempest; the  men get drunk and fall over; and altogether it appears extraordinary  that a raft put together at the Trent village for its final voyage to  Quebec should ever reach its destination, the transport being at least  four hundred and fifty miles, and many go much farther, through an open  and ever agitated fresh water sea, and amongst the intricate channels of  The Thousand Islands, and down the tremendous rapids of the Longue  Sault, the Gallope, the Cedars, the Cascades, &c.    But a new trade, has lately commenced on Lake Ontario, which will break  up some of the hardships of the rafting. Old steamboats of very large  size, when no longer serviceable in their vocation, are now cut down,  and perhaps lengthened, masted, and rigged as barques or ships, and  treated in every respect like the Atlantic timber-vessels. Into these  three-masters, these Leviathans of Lake Ontario, the timber, boards,  staves, handspikes, &c., from the interior are now shipped, and the  timber carried to the head of the St. Lawrence navigation.    One step more, and they will, as soon as the canals are widened, proceed  from Lake Superior to London without a raft being ever made.    That this will soon occur is very evident; for a large vessel of this  kind, as big as a frigate, and named the Goliath, is at the moment that  I am writing preparing at Toronto, near the head of Lake Ontario, a  thousand miles from the open sea, for a voyage direct to the West Indies  and back again. Success to her! What with the railroad from Halifax to  Lake Huron, from the Atlantic Ocean to the great fresh ocean of the  West--what with the electric telegraph now in operation on the banks of  the Niagara by the Americans--what with the lighting of villages on the  shores of Lake Erie with natural gas, as Fredonia is lit, and as the  city of the Falls of Niagara, if ever it is built, will also be, there  is no telling what will happen: at all events, the poor lumberer must  benefit in the next generation, for the worst portion of his toils will  be done away with for ever.    Settler, never become a lumberer, if you can avoid it.    But, as we have in this favourite hobbyhorse style of ours, which causes  description to start up as recollections occur, accompanied the lumberer  on his voyage to that lumberer's Paradise, Quebec, whither he has  conducted his charge to The Coves, for the culler to cull, the marker to  mark, the skipper to ship, and the lumber-merchant to get the best  market he can for it, so we shall return for a short time to Lower  Canada, to talk a little about settlement there.    As I hinted before, Lower Canada is too much decried as a country to  re-commence the world in; but the Anglo-Saxon and Milesian populace are  nevertheless beginning to discover its value, and are very rapidly  increasing both in numbers and importance. The French Canadian yeoman,  or small farmer, has an alacrity at standing still; it is only _le  notaire_ and _le medecin_ that advance; so that, if emigration goes on  at the rate it has done since the rebellion, the old country folks will,  before fifty more years pass over, outnumber and outvote, by ten times,  Jean Baptiste, which is a pity, for a better soul than that merry  mixture of bonhomie and phlegm, the French Canadian is, the wide world's  surface does not produce. Visionary notions of _la gloire de la nation  Canadienne_, instilled into him by restless men, who panted for  distinction and cared not for distraction, misled the _bonnet rouge_  awhile: but he has superadded the thinking cap since; and, although he  may not readily forget the sad lesson he received, yet he has no more  idea of being annexed to the United States than I have of being Grand  Lama. In fact, I really believe that the merciful policy which has been  shown, and the wise measure of making Montreal the seat of government,  and thus practically demonstrating the advantage of the institutions of  England by daily lessons in the heart of their dear country, has done  more to recall the Canadians to a sense of the real value of the  connexion with Great Britain than all the protocols of diplomatists, or  all the powder that ever saltpetre generated, could have achieved.    Pursue a perfectly impartial course, as you ought and must do, towards  the Canadians, and show them that they are as much British citizens as  the people of Toronto are, and you may count upon their loyalty and  devotion without fear. They know they never can be an independent  nation; that folly has been dreamed out, and the fumes of the vision are  evaporating.    They now know and feel that annexation to the great Republic in their  neighbourhood will swamp their nationality more effectively than the red  or the blue coats of England can ever do, will desecrate their altars,  will portion out their lands, will nullify their present importance, and  render them an isolated race, forgotten and unsought for, as the  Iroquois of the last century, who, from being the children and owners of  the land, the true _enfans du sol_, are now--where? The soil, had it  voice, could alone reply, for on its surface they are not.    We must never in England form a false estimate of the French Canadian,  because a few briefless lawyers or saddle-bag medical men urged them  into rebellion.

And it follows also  from this law of construction that there must never be any hesitation  or repentance in the direction of your lines of limit. So that not  only in the beautiful dexterity of the joiner's work, but in the  necessity of cutting out each piece of color at once and forever (for,  though you can correct an erroneous junction of black and white  because the gray between has the nature of either, you cannot correct  an erroneous junction of red and green which make a neutral between  them, if they overlap, that is neither red nor green): thus the  practice of color educates at once in neatness of hand and  distinctness of will; so that, as I wrote long ago in the third volume  of \"Modern Painters,\" you are always safe if you hold the hand of a  colorist.    70. I have brought you a little sketch to-day from the foreground of a  Venetian picture, in which there is a bit that will show you this  precision of method. It is the head of a parrot with a little flower  in his beak from a picture of Carpaccio's, one of his series of the  Life of St. George. I could not get the curves of the leaves, and they  are patched and spoiled; but the parrot's head, however badly done, is  put down with no more touches than the Venetian gave it, and it will  show you exactly his method. First, a thin, warm ground had been laid  over the whole canvas, which Carpaccio wanted as an under-current  through all the color, just as there is an under-current of gray in  the Loire drawings. Then on this he strikes his parrot in vermilion,  almost flat color; rounding a little only with a glaze of lake; but  attending mainly to get the character of the bird by the pure outline  of its form, as if it were cut out of a piece of ruby glass.    Then he comes to the beak of it. The brown ground beneath is left, for  the most part; one touch of black is put for the hollow; two delicate  lines of dark gray define the outer curve; and one little quivering  touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible. There are just  four touches--fine as the finest penmanship--to do that beak; and yet  you will find that in the peculiar paroquettish mumbling and nibbling  action of it, and all the character in which this nibbling beak  differs from the tearing beak of the eagle, it is impossible to go  farther or be more precise. And this is only an incident, remember, in  a large picture.    71. Let me notice, in passing, the infinite absurdity of ever hanging  Venetian pictures above the line of sight. There are very few persons  in the room who will be able to see the drawing of this bird's beak  without a magnifying-glass; yet it is ten to one that in any modern  gallery such a picture would be hung thirty feet from the ground.    Here, again, is a little bit to show Carpaccio's execution. It is his  signature: only a little wall-lizard, holding the paper in its mouth,  perfect; yet so small that you can scarcely see its feet, and that I  could not, with my finest-pointed brush, copy their stealthy action.    72. And now, I think, the members of my class will more readily  pardon the intensely irksome work I put them to, with the compasses  and the ruler. Measurement and precision are, with me, before all  things; just because, though myself trained wholly in the chiaroscuro  schools, I know the value of color; and I want you to begin with color  in the very outset, and to see everything as children would see it.  For, believe me, the final philosophy of art can only ratify their  opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red, and of a  grass-plot to be green; and the best skill of art is in instantly  seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light, which you can only  seize by precision of instantaneous touch. Of course, I cannot do so  myself; yet in these sketches of mine, made for the sake of color,  there is enough to show you the nature and the value of the method.  They are two pieces of study of the color of marble architecture, the  tints literally \"edified,\" and laid edge to edge as simply on the  paper as the stones are on the walls.    73. But please note in them one thing especially. The testing rule I  gave for good color in the \"Elements of Drawing,\" is that you make the  white precious and the black conspicuous. Now you will see in these  studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly, and harmonized  with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than  the white paper; and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of  untreated white paper all round it, being sure that even the little  diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels, if they are gradated  justly.    Again, there is not a touch of black in any shadow, however deep, of  these two studies; so that, if I chose to put a piece of black near  them, it would be conspicuous with a vengeance.    But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles  brought out perfectly. You have the white of foaming water, of  buildings and clouds, brought out brilliantly from a white ground; and  though part of the subject is in deep shadow the eye at once catches  the one black point admitted in front.    74. Well, the first reason that I gave you these Loire drawings was  this of their infallible decision; the second was their extreme  modesty in color. They are, beyond all other works that I know  existing, dependent for their effect on low, subdued tones; their  favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight, and even  their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper. This last,  the loveliest of all, gives the warmth of a summer twilight with a  tinge of color on the gray paper so slight that it may be a question  with some of you whether any is there. And I must beg you to observe,  and receive as a rule without any exception, that whether color be gay  or sad the value of it depends never on violence, but always on  subtlety. It may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of  color, as a singer his full power of voice; but, loud or low, the  virtue is in both cases always in refinement, never in loudness. The  west window of Chartres is bedropped with crimson deeper than blood;  but it is as soft as it is deep, and as quiet as the light of dawn.    75. I say, \"whether color be gay or sad.\" It must, remember, be one or  the other. You know I told you that the pure Gothic school of color  was entirety cheerful; that, as applied to landscape, it assumes that  all nature is lovely, and may be clearly seen; that destruction and  decay are accidents of our present state, never to be thought of  seriously, and, above all things, never to be painted; but that  whatever is orderly, healthy, radiant, fruitful and beautiful, is to  be loved with all our hearts and painted with all our skill.    76. I told you also that no complete system of art for either natural  history or landscape could be formed on this system; that the wrath of  a wild beast, and the tossing of a mountain torrent are equally  impossible to a painter of the purist school; that in higher fields of  thought increasing knowledge means increasing sorrow, and every art  which has complete sympathy with humanity must be chastened by the  sight and oppressed by the memory of pain. But there is no reason why  your system of study should be a complete one, if it be right and  profitable though incomplete. If you can find it in your hearts to  follow out only the Gothic thoughts of landscape, I deeply wish you  would, and for many reasons.    77. First, it has never yet received due development; for at the  moment when artistic skill and knowledge of effect became sufficient  to complete its purposes, the Reformation destroyed the faith in which  they might have been accomplished; for to the whole body of powerful  draughtsmen the Reformation meant the Greek school and the shadow of  death. So that of exquisitely developed Gothic landscape you may count  the examples on the fingers of your hand: Van Eyck's \"Adoration of the  Lamb\" at Bruges; another little Van Eyck in the Louvre; the John  Bellini lately presented to the National Gallery;[12] another John  Bellini in Rome: and the \"St. George\" of Carpaccio at Venice, are all  that I can name myself of great works. But there exist some exquisite,  though feebler, designs in missal painting; of which, in England, the  landscape and flowers in the Psalter of Henry the Sixth will serve you  for a sufficient type; the landscape in the Grimani missal at Venice  being monumentally typical and perfect.    [Footnote 12: No. 812. \"Landscape, with the Death of St. Peter  Martyr.\"]    78. Now for your own practice in this, having first acquired the skill  of exquisite delineation and laying of pure color, day by day you must  draw some lovely natural form or flower or animal without  obscurity--as in missal painting; choosing for study, in natural  scenes, only what is beautiful and strong in life.    79. I fully anticipated, at the beginning of the Pre-Raphaelite  movement, that they would have carried forward this method of work;  but they broke themselves to pieces by pursuing dramatic sensation  instead of beauty. So that to this day all the loveliest things in the  world remain unpainted; and although we have occasionally spasmodic  efforts and fits of enthusiasm, and green meadows and apple-blossom to  spare, it yet remains a fact that not in all this England, and still  less in France, have you a painter who has been able nobly to paint  so much as a hedge of wild roses or a forest glade full of anemones or  wood-sorrel.    80. One reason of this has been the idea that such work was easy, on  the part of the young men who attempted it, and the total vulgarity  and want of education in the great body of abler artists, rendering  them insensitive to qualities of fine delineation; the universal law  for them being that they can draw a pig, but"]]]
