Take the address, Mr. 'Iggins, if you please.\"    Such was the general drift of Mr. Cattell's observations on the  occasion of his first interview with Mr. Denton. About a month later,  being advised that some samples were ready for his inspection, Mr.  Denton met him again, and had, it seems, reason to be satisfied with  the faithfulness of the reproduction of the design. It had been  finished off at the top in accordance with the indication I mentioned,  so that the vertical bands joined. But something still needed to be  done in the way of matching the colour of the original. Mr. Cattell  had suggestions of a technical kind to offer, with which I need not  trouble you. He had also views as to the general desirability of the  pattern which were vaguely adverse. \"You say you don't wish this to be  supplied excepting to personal friends equipped with a authorization  from yourself, sir. It shall be done. I quite understand your wish to  keep it exclusive: lends a catchit, does it not, to the suite?  What's every man's, it's been said, is no man's.\"    \"Do you think it would be popular if it were generally obtainable?\"  asked Mr. Denton.    \"I 'ardly think it, sir,\" said Cattell, pensively clasping his beard.  \"I 'ardly think it. Not popular: it wasn't popular with the man that  cut the block, was it, Mr. 'Iggins?\"    \"Did he find it a difficult job?\"    \"He'd no call to do so, sir; but the fact is that the artistic  temperament--and our men are artists, sir, every man of them--true  artists as much as many that the world styles by that term--it's apt  to take some strange 'ardly accountable likes or dislikes, and here  was an example. The twice or thrice that I went to inspect his  progress: language I could understand, for that's 'abitual to him, but  reel distaste for what I should call a dainty enough thing, I did not,  nor am I now able to fathom. It seemed,\" said Mr. Cattell, looking  narrowly upon Mr. Denton, \"as if the man scented something almost  Hevil in the design.\"    \"Indeed? did he tell you so? I can't say I see anything sinister in it  myself.\"    \"Neether can I, sir. In fact I said as much. 'Come, Gatwick,' I said,  'what's to do here? What's the reason of your prejudice--for I can  call it no more than that?' But, no! no explanation was forthcoming.  And I was merely reduced, as I am now, to a shrug of the shoulders,  and a _cui bono_. However, here it is,\" and with that the technical  side of the question came to the front again.    The matching of the colours for the background, the hem, and the knots  of ribbon was by far the longest part of the business, and  necessitated many sendings to and fro of the original pattern and of  new samples. During part of August and September, too, the Dentons  were away from the Manor. So that it was not until October was well in  that a sufficient quantity of the stuff had been manufactured to  furnish curtains for the three or four bedrooms which were to be  fitted up with it.    On the feast of Simon and Jude the aunt and nephew returned from a  short visit to find all completed, and their satisfaction at the  general effect was great. The new curtains, in particular, agreed to  admiration with their surroundings. When Mr. Denton was dressing for  dinner, and took stock of his room, in which there was a large amount  of the chintz displayed, he congratulated himself over and over again  on the luck which had first made him forget his aunt's commission and  had then put into his hands this extremely effective means of  remedying his mistake. The pattern was, as he said at dinner, so  restful and yet so far from being dull. And Miss Denton--who, by the  way, had none of the stuff in her own room--was much disposed to agree  with him.    At breakfast next morning he was induced to qualify his satisfaction  to some extent--but very slightly. \"There is one thing I rather  regret,\" he said, \"that we allowed them to join up the vertical bands  of the pattern at the top. I think it would have been better to leave  that alone.\"    \"Oh?\" said his aunt interrogatively.    \"Yes: as I was reading in bed last night they kept catching my eye  rather. That is, I found myself looking across at them every now and  then. There was an effect as if some one kept peeping out between the  curtains in one place or another, where there was no edge, and I think  that was due to the joining up of the bands at the top. The only other  thing that troubled me was the wind.\"    \"Why, I thought it was a perfectly still night.\"    \"Perhaps it was only on my side of the house, but there was enough to  sway my curtains and rustle them more than I wanted.\"    That night a bachelor friend of James Denton's came to stay, and was  lodged in a room on the same floor as his host, but at the end of a  long passage, halfway down which was a red baize door, put there to  cut off the draught and intercept noise.    The party of three had separated. Miss Denton a good first, the two  men at about eleven. James Denton, not yet inclined for bed, sat him  down in an arm-chair and read for a time. Then he dozed, and then he  woke, and bethought himself that his brown spaniel, which ordinarily  slept in his room, had not come upstairs with him. Then he thought he  was mistaken: for happening to move his hand which hung down over the  arm of the chair within a few inches of the floor, he felt on the back  of it just the slightest touch of a surface of hair, and stretching it  out in that direction he stroked and patted a rounded something. But  the feel of it, and still more the fact that instead of a responsive  movement, absolute stillness greeted his touch, made him look over  the arm. What he had been touching rose to meet him. It was in the  attitude of one that had crept along the floor on its belly, and it  was, so far as could be collected, a human figure. But of the face  which was now rising to within a few inches of his own no feature was  discernible, only hair. Shapeless as it was, there was about it so  horrible an air of menace that as he bounded from his chair and rushed  from the room he heard himself moaning with fear: and doubtless he did  right to fly. As he dashed into the baize door that cut the passage in  two, and--forgetting that it opened towards him--beat against it with  all the force in him, he felt a soft ineffectual tearing at his back  which, all the same, seemed to be growing in power, as if the hand, or  whatever worse than a hand was there, were becoming more material as  the pursuer's rage was more concentrated. Then he remembered the trick  of the door--he got it open--he shut it behind him--he gained his  friend's room, and that is all we need know.    It seems curious that, during all the time that had elapsed since the  purchase of Poynter's diary, James Denton should not have sought an  explanation of the presence of the pattern that had been pinned into  it. Well, he had read the diary through without finding it mentioned,  and had concluded that there was nothing to be said. But, on leaving  Rendcomb Manor (he did not know whether for good), as he naturally  insisted upon doing on the day after experiencing the horror I have  tried to put into words, he took the diary with him. And at his  seaside lodgings he examined more narrowly the portion whence the  pattern had been taken. What he remembered having suspected about it  turned out to be correct. Two or three leaves were pasted together,  but written upon, as was patent when they were held up to the light.  They yielded easily to steaming, for the paste had lost much of its  strength, and they contained something relevant to the pattern.    The entry was made in 1707.         \"Old Mr. Casbury, of Acrington, told me this day much of       young Sir Everard Charlett, whom he remember'd Commoner of       University College, and thought was of the same Family as       Dr. Arthur Charlett, now master of ye Coll. This Charlett       was a personable young gent., but a loose atheistical       companion, and a great Lifter, as they then call'd the hard       drinkers, and for what I know do so now. He was noted, and       subject to severall censures at different times for his       extravagancies: and if the full history of his debaucheries       had bin known, no doubt would have been expell'd ye Coll.,       supposing that no interest had been imploy'd on his behalf,       of which Mr. Casbury had some suspicion. He was a very       beautiful person, and constantly wore his own Hair, which       was very abundant, from which, and his loose way of living,       the cant name for him was Absalom, and he was accustom'd to       say that indeed he believ'd he had shortened old David's       days, meaning his father, Sir Job Charlett, an old worthy       cavalier.         \"Note that Mr. Casbury said that he remembers not the year       of Sir Everard Charlett's death, but it was 1692 or 3. He       died suddenly in October. [Several lines describing his       unpleasant habits and reputed delinquencies are omitted.]       Having seen him in such topping spirits the night before,       Mr. Casbury was amaz'd when he learn'd the death. He was       found in the town ditch, the hair as was said pluck'd clean       off his head. Most bells in Oxford rung out for him, being a       nobleman, and he was buried next night in St. Peter's in the       East. But two years after, being to be moved to his country       estate by his successor, it was said the coffin, breaking by       mischance, proved quite full of Hair: which sounds fabulous,       but yet I believe precedents are upon record, as in Dr.       Plot's _History of Staffordshire_.         \"His chambers being afterwards stripp'd, Mr. Casbury came by       part of the hangings of it, which 'twas said this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#8)"],[1,"seen with the naked eye, usually being found associated with  pond scums or other filamentous forms. Many of the most beautiful  forms may be obtained by examining the matter adhering to the leaves  and stems of many floating water plants, especially the bladder weed  (_Utricularia_) and other fine-leaved aquatics.      The desmids include the most beautiful examples of unicellular    plants to be met with, the cells having extremely elegant outlines.    The cell shows a division into two parts, and is often constricted    in the middle, each division having a single large chloroplast of    peculiar form. The central part of the cell in which the nucleus    lies is colorless.      Among the commonest forms, often growing with _Spirogyra_, are    various species of _Closterium_ (Fig. 20, _A_, _B_), recognizable at    once by their crescent shape. The cell appears bright green, except    at the ends and in the middle. The large chloroplast in each half is    composed of six longitudinal plates, united at the axis of the cell.    Several large pyrenoids are always found, often forming a regular    line through the central axis. At each end of the cell is a vacuole    containing small granules that show an active dancing movement.    The desmids often have the power of movement, swimming or creeping  slowly over the slide as we examine them, but the mechanism of these  movements is still doubtful.    In their reproduction they closely resemble the pond scums.      ORDER IV.--_Siphoneae_.    The _Siphoneae_ are algae occurring both in fresh and salt water, and  are distinguished from other algae by having the form of a tube,  undivided by partition walls, except when reproduction occurs. The  only common representatives of the order in fresh water are those  belonging to the genus _Vaucheria_, but these are to be had almost  everywhere. They usually occur in shallow ditches and ponds, growing  on the bottom, or not infrequently becoming free, and floating where  the water is deeper. They form large, dark green, felted masses, and  are sometimes known as \"green felts.\" Some species grow also on the  wet ground about springs. An examination of one of the masses shows it  to be made up of closely matted, hair-like threads, each of which is  an individual plant.      In transferring the plants to the slide for microscopic examination,    they must be handled very carefully, as they are very easily    injured. Each thread is a long tube, branching sometimes, but not    divided into cells as in _Spirogyra_ or _Cladophora_. If we follow    it to the tip, the contents here will be found to be denser, this    being the growing point. By careful focusing it is easy to show that    the protoplasm is confined to a thin layer lining the wall, the    central cavity of the tube being filled with cell sap. In the    protoplasm are numerous elongated chloroplasts (_cl._). and a larger    or smaller number of small, shining, globular bodies (_ol._). These    latter are drops of oil, and, when the filaments are injured,    sometimes run together, and form drops of large size. No nucleus can    be seen in the living plant, but by treatment with chromic acid and    staining, numerous very small nuclei may be demonstrated.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--_A_, _C_, successive stages in the  development of the sexual organs of a green felt (_Vaucheria_). _an._  antheridium. _og._ ooegonium. _D_, a ripe ooegonium. _E_, the same after  it has opened. _o_, the egg cell. _F_, a ripe spore. _G_, a species in  which the sexual organs are borne separately on the main filament.  _A_, _F_, x 150. _G_, x 50. _cl._ chloroplasts. _ol._ oil.]      When the filaments are growing upon the ground, or at the bottom of    shallow water, the lower end is colorless, and forms a more or less    branching root-like structure, fastening it to the earth. These    rootlets, like the rest of the filament, are undivided by walls.      One of the commonest and at the same time most characteristic    species is _Vaucheria racemosa_ (Fig. 21, _A_, _F_). The plant    multiplies non-sexually by branches pinched off by a constriction at    the point where they join the main filament, or by the filament    itself becoming constricted and separating into several parts, each    one constituting a new individual.      The sexual organs are formed on special branches, and their    arrangement is such as to make the species instantly recognizable.      The first sign of their development is the formation of a short    branch (Fig. 21, _A_) growing out at right angles to the main    filament. This branch becomes club-shaped, and the end somewhat    pointed and more slender, and curves over. This slender, curved    portion is almost colorless, and is soon shut off from the rest of    the branch. It is called an \"antheridium,\" and within are produced,    by internal division, numerous excessively small spermatozoids.      As the branch grows, its contents become very dense, the oil drops    especially increasing in number and size. About the time that the    antheridium becomes shut off, a circle of buds appears about its    base (Fig. 21, _B_, _og._). These are the young ooegonia, which    rapidly increase in size, assuming an oval form, and become    separated by walls from the main branch (_C_). Unlike the    antheridium, the ooegonia contain a great deal of chlorophyll,    appearing deep green.      When ripe, the antheridium opens at the end and discharges the    spermatozoids, which are, however, so very small as scarcely to be    visible except with the strongest lenses. They are little oval    bodies with two cilia, which may sometimes be rendered visible by    staining with iodine.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--_A_, non-sexual reproduction in _Vaucheria  sessilis_. _B_, non-sexual spore of _V. geminata_, x 50.]      The ooegonia, which at first are uniformly colored, just before    maturity show a colorless space at the top, from which the    chloroplasts and oil drops have disappeared (_D_), and at the same    time this portion pushes out in the form of a short beak. Soon after    the wall is absorbed at this point, and a portion of the contents is    forced out, leaving an opening, and at the same time the remaining    contents contract to form a round mass, the germ or egg cell    (Fig. 21, _E_, _o_). Almost as soon as the ooegonium opens, the    spermatozoids collect about it and enter; but, on account of their    minuteness, it is almost impossible to follow them into the egg    cell, or to determine whether several or only one enter. The    fertilized egg cell becomes almost at once surrounded by a wall,    which rapidly thickens, and forms a resting spore. As the spore    ripens, it loses its green color, becoming colorless, with a few    reddish brown specks scattered through it (_F_).      In some species the sexual organs are borne directly on the filament    (Fig. 21, _G_).      Large zooespores are formed in some of the green felts (Fig. 22,    _A_), and are produced singly in the ends of branches that become    swollen, dark green, and filled with very dense protoplasm. This end    becomes separated by a wall from the rest of the branch, the end    opens, and the contents escape as a very large zooespore, covered    with numerous short cilia (_A_ ii). After a short period of    activity, this loses its cilia, develops a wall, and begins to grow    (III, IV). Other species (_B_) produce similar spores, which,    however, are not motile, and remain within the mother cell until    they are set free by the decay of its wall.      ORDER V.--_Characeae_.    The _Characeae_, or stone-worts, as some of them are called, are so  very different from the other green algae that it is highly probable  that they should be separated from them.    The type of the order is the genus _Chara_ (Fig. 23), called  stone-worts from the coating of carbonate of lime found in most of  them, giving them a harsh, stony texture. Several species are common  growing upon the bottom of ponds and slow streams, and range in size  from a few centimetres to a metre or more in height.    The plant (Fig. 23, _A_) consists of a central jointed axis with  circles of leaves at each joint or node. The distance between the  nodes (internodes) may in the larger species reach a length of several  centimetres. The leaves are slender, cylindrical structures, and like  the stem divided into nodes and internodes, and have at the nodes  delicate leaflets.    At each joint of the leaf, in fruiting specimens, attached to the  inner side, are borne two small, roundish bodies, in the commoner  species of a reddish color (Fig. 23, _A_, _r_). The lower of the two  is globular, and bright scarlet in color; the other, more oval and  duller.    Examined with a lens the main axis presents a striated appearance. The  whole plant is harsh to the touch and brittle, owing to the limy  coating. It is fastened to the ground by fine, colorless hairs, or  rootlets.
