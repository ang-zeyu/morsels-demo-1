Those their protectors who betray,  Unpitying, all the world will see  Consign'd to death and infamy.          [Illustration]    THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG.      Titles and ribands, bought with shame,  Folly and vice but more proclaim.  A man who own'd a vicious dog,  Upon his collar fix'd a log,  Which the vain cur supposed to be  A note of worth and dignity.  A mastiff saw his foolish pride;  \"Puppy,\" indignantly he cried,  \"That thing is put about your neck  Your mischievous designs to check;  And to who see you to declare,  Of what a currish race you are.\"          [Illustration]    THE SICK MAN AND THE PHYSICIAN.      Woe to the land where those who guide,  To please the people's foolish pride,  Persuade them there is nought to dread,  When ruin threatens o'er their head.    A patient, ask'd to tell his pains,  Of thirst and shivering cold complains.  \"'Tis very good,\" the doctor said;  \"He has but to remain in bed,  And take the med'cines I shall send,  The thing will soon be at an end.\"  When next the question was repeated,  The man complain'd he much was heated;  \"This,\" cried the leech, \"is better still!\"  And thus to each increasing ill,  \"That it was going well,\" he cried,  Till the poor martyr sunk and died.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FARMER AND HIS SONS.      Work, work, my boys, with hand and mind!  Your labors you will fruitful find.    A husbandman, about to die,  Call'd on his children to come nigh:  \"I leave,\" he says, \"a small estate,  But wherewithal to make it great:  For know, a treasure it contains,  If you to search will take the pains.\"  He died. The sons dug all the ground,  And there no hidden treasure found;  But so productive was the soil,  The crop by far o'erpaid the toil.  Says one, when they the corn had sold,  \"This treasure 'twas our sire foretold!\"    [Illustration:]          [Illustration]    THE SWALLOW AND THE BIRDS.      Those who of guides stand most in need,  Are least inclin'd advice to heed.    A travell'd swallow, learn'd and wise,  To all his feather'd neighbors cries:  \"See you yon laborers there below;  What is it, think ye, that they sow?  'Tis hemp, my friends; of which are made  The nets that for us all are laid;  The moment yonder men are gone,  Then pick the seeds up one by one.\"  The gay inhabitants of air  For his precaution little care.  The seedling sprung; again the swallow  Urges his good advice to follow;  Again his counsel they deride.  The plants full grown, and cut, and dried,  Beaten and spun, the nets were made,  And the unwary birds betray'd,  Regretting, in their hapless fate,  Their incredulity too late.    Learn hence the danger to foresee,  Nor wait for their maturity.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BOASTING TRAVELLER.      A fellow who abroad had been,  Told marvels he had done and seen:  \"When resident at Rhodes,\" he said,  \"A leap of twenty yards he made  Over a barrier ten feet high;  A dozen witnesses were by.\"  \"Come on,\" says one, at the same table,  \"Yon ditch and fence to o'erleap you're able.  They're not, by much, so high or wide;  Here let the experiment be tried.  Suppose yourself at Rhodes, and we  Your faithful witnesses will be.\"  The man replied, \"that he to-day  Was not quite well,\" and stole away.    Who boast of what they cannot do  Both knavery and folly show.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE OLD WOMAN AND HER MAIDS.      Better known evils to endure,  Than seek by wrong a doubtful cure.    A thrifty dame her maids awoke  At the first crowing of the cock.  They of such early rising tir'd,  To kill the harmless cock conspir'd.  The dame, to hear him crow in wait,  Next morning lay in bed till eight.  But when she knew the trick they had play'd,  She caused a larum to be made,  And rung it daily in their ears  Two hours before the dawn appears.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    INDUSTRY AND SLOTH.      Insidious sloth her object gains,  If but a hearing she obtains.    A youth ask'd why so long in bed?  \"I listen to a cause,\" he said;  \"As soon as I unclose my eyes.  First industry excites to rise.\"  \"Up, up,\" she says, \"to meet the sun,  Your task of yesterday's undone!\"  \"Lie still,\" cries sloth, \"it is not warm,  An hour's more sleep can do no harm;  You will have time your work to do,  And leisure for amusement too.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SHEPHERD TURNED MERCHANT.      Fair weather sailors, keep at home,  For be assur'd the storm will come.    A shepherd of an inland breed  Brought to the coast his flocks to feed;  The beauty of a summer sea,  A merchant tempted him to be.  He sold his sheep, and with the sale  Purchas'd of dates an ample bale.  He sail'd; a furious tempest rose;  Into the sea his dates he throws;  And swimming from the bark to land,  Arrives half dead upon the strand.  To one, soon afterwards who stood  Pleas'd with the calmness of the flood,  \"Aye, aye,\" the simple shepherd said  \"With dates again it would be fed.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE  SWALLOW.      A fool who all had thrown away,  When wandering pennyless one day,  Perceived a swallow. \"Ho,\" says he,  \"Summer is come at last I see!\"  And to a Jew his mantle sold.  Next day it was severely cold:  Starv'd as he walk'd, the bird he found  Frozen to death upon the ground.  \"Ah! what a fool was I,\" he cried,  \"When on one swallow I relied!\"    Those who too readily believe,  For their credulity may grieve.          [Illustration]    THE EAGLE AND THE CROW.      The wise well know their force to weigh,  Nor what they cannot do, essay.    A carrion crow an eagle saw  Seize on a lamb with beak and claw.  Conceiving he could better do,  He pounces on a well fed ewe;  But he and not the sheep was caught;  For when to fly with it he sought,  His feet entangled in the wool,  The shepherd seiz'd the helpless fool.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERD'S  BOY.      In wantonness a shepherd's boy  Alarm'd the neighbor's with his cry;  \"The wolf! the wolf!\" And when they came,  Of their lost labor made his game.  At last the wolf when there indeed,  His real cries they did not heed;  He and his flock a prey were made,  And for his lies he dearly paid.    Those who are known to have deceiv'd,  When they speak truth, are not believ'd.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL.      Fashions and modes we often see,  Made to conceal deformity:  Those to whom nature has been kind,  Should leave such fopperies behind.    A fox who in a trap was taken,  Resign'd his brush to save his bacon.  Ashamed that all the world should know  His cunning had been cheated so,  To an assembly of the nation  He made the following oration:  \"I oft have thought the tails we wear  A troublesome appendage are;  Where's their utility, I pray?  They serve but to obstruct our way.  Nor ornamental do I find,  To drag this ponderous length behind.  For my part, without more debate,  I move our tails we amputate.\"  \"Please, sir, to show yourself behind,\"  (Says one to smoke the jest inclin'd,  And who discovered what it was)  \"We there perhaps shall see the cause,  Ere we your prudent counsel take,  Why you this curious motion make?\"  His bare posteriors when they found,  Loud laughter shook the benches round;  Nor could the fox without a tail  To introduce the mode prevail.          [Illustration]    THE MEN AND THE OYSTER.      Any partition better make,  Than _all_ the hungry law should take.    By the sea side two travellers found  A fine large oyster on the ground;  His claim each obstinately lays:  \"I saw it first,\" one eager says;  \"I pick'd it up,\" the other cries;  \"Mine\"--\"Mine is certainly the prize.\"  They talk'd as usual, loud and long;  And more they reason'd, more were wrong;  Till they a neighboring lawyer see  Passing, and mutually agree  To take him for their referee.  With legal dignity of face,  He heard them both relate the case;  \"Your claims are good,\" then gravely said,  \"And a brave lawsuit would have made  Which to prefer I cannot tell,  So each of you must take a shell;  And, as the oyster is but one,  That I myself will swallow down;  To stink it otherwise had lain,  And all your cash been spent in vain;  You're cheaply off; go home content;  And faith the fish was excellent.\"          [Illustration]    THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG.      A dog his master so deceiv'd,  He was the best of curs believ'd.  The flock was trusted to his care,  Whene'er the shepherd was not there.  And in the house, a favored guest,  He always fed upon the best.  The treacherous guard his charge betray'd  And on the sheep in secret prey'd.  The master, when the crime was prov'd,  With double indignation mov'd,  About his neck the halter tied  Himself: the dog for mercy cried;  \"You let the wolf escape,\" he said,  \"Who much more slaughter oft has made.\"  \"Wretch!\" says the man, \"the wolf declares  Hostility, and boldly dares;  He has no confidence abused:  But, coward, thou my trust hast used:  Against myself! and on this tree  Without delay shalt hanged be.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE  JUSTICE.      The law still lends the readiest aid,  When well her ministers are paid.    A countryman, by power oppress'd,  Seeking to have his wrongs redress'd,  Oft to the justice went in vain;  Admittance he could ne'er obtain,  But still was bid again to come;  \"Unwell\"--\"engag'd\"--or \"not home!\"  The wily rustic took a kid  One day, and in a basket hid;  And when he to the house drew near,  Began to pinch him by the ear,  So that the porter, from the hall,  Might hear the little fatling squall;  The man his master's mind who knew,  Open'd the door and let him through.  The shepherd, laughing as he pass'd,  Says to his kid, \"Thy cries at last  An audience for my wrongs obtain;  Thy flesh, perhaps, redress will gain.\"        "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21200"],[0,"The Letters of Cicero, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1," statesman's chief  object, and almost any concession was to be preferred to endangering  these.\" Nevertheless, we cannot think that Cicero was ever heartily  reconciled to the policy, or the unconstitutional preponderance of the  triumvirs. He patched up some sort of reconciliation with Crassus, and  his personal affection for Pompey made it comparatively easy for him to  give him a kind of support. Caesar was away, and a correspondence filled  on both sides with courteous expressions could be maintained without  seriously compromising his convictions. But Cicero was never easy under  the yoke. From B.C. 55 to B.C. 52 he sought several opportunities for a  prolonged stay in the country, devoting himself--in default of  politics--to literature. The fruits of this were the _de Oratore_ and  the _de Republica_, besides poems on his own times and on his  consulship. Still he was obliged from time to time to appear in the  forum and senate-house, and in various ways to gratify Pompey and Caesar.  It must have been a great strain upon his loyalty to this new political  friendship when, in B.C. 54, Pompey called upon him to undertake the  defence of P. Vatinius, whom he had not long before attacked so fiercely  while defending Sestius. Vatinius had been a tribune in B.C. 59, acting  entirely in Caesar's interests, and Cicero believed him to have been his  enemy both in the matter of his exile and in the opposition to his  recall. He had denounced him in terms that would have made it almost  impossible, one would think, to have spoken in his defence in any cause  whatever. At best he represented all that Cicero most disliked in  politics; and on this very election, to the praetorship, for which he was  charged with bribery (_de sodalitiis_), Cicero had already spoken in  strongly hostile terms in the senate. For now undertaking his defence he  has, in fact, no explanation to give to Lentulus (vol. i., p. 319), and  he was long sore at having been forced to do it. Through B.C. 54 and 53  he was busied with his _de Republica_, and was kept more in touch with  Caesar by the fact that his brother Quintus was serving as _legatus_ to  the latter in Britain and Gaul, and that his friend Trebatius  (introduced by himself) was seeking for promotion and profit in Caesar's  camp. But even his brother's service with Caesar did not eventually  contribute to the formation of cordial feeling on his part towards  Caesar, whom he could not help admiring, but never really liked. For  Quintus, though he distinguished himself by his defence of his camp in  the autumn of B.C. 54, lost credit and subjected himself to grave rebuke  by the disaster incurred in B.C. 53, near Aduatuca (_Tongres_), brought  about by disregarding an express order of Caesar's. There is no allusion  to this in the extant correspondence, but a fragment of letter from  Caesar to Cicero (_neque pro cauto ac diligente se castris  continuit_[16]), seems to shew that Caesar had written sharply to Cicero  on his brother's _faux pas_, and after this time, though Cicero met  Caesar at Ravenna in B.C. 52, and consented to support the bill allowing  him to stand for the consulship in his absence,[17] there is apparent in  his references to him a return to the cold or critical tone of former  times. But of course there were other reasons.    [Sidenote: Pompey's third Consulship and the trial of Milo, B.C. 52.]    Pompey's six months' sole consulship of B.C. 52 (\"that divine third  consulship\"), the rumour of his dictatorship, and the growing  determination of the Optimates to play off Pompey against Caesar (Crassus  having disappeared) and to insist on Caesar resigning his province and  army before the end of his ten years' tenure, and before standing for a  second consulship, caused Cicero's hope of a final dissolution of the  unconstitutional compact to revive again; and made him draw more and  more closely to Pompey as the chief hope of the _boni_. In the beginning  of the year he had found himself in opposition, or quasi-opposition, to  Pompey in regard to the prosecution of Milo for the murder of Clodius.  But though in the previous year he had declared that the election of  Milo to the consulship was of the utmost importance to his own position  and the safety of the state,[18] now that it was rendered impossible by  Milo's condemnation, he seems to have placed all his hopes on Pompey.  Unfortunately, there is here a break in the correspondence. There is no  letter of the last six months of B.C. 53, and only four (perhaps only  three) of B.C. 52.[19] So that the riots which prevented Milo's  election, the death of Clodius and the riots following it, and the  consequent sole consulship of Pompey, with the latter's new legislation  and the trial of Milo--all have to be sought for elsewhere. The last  letter of this volume and of this year, addressed to M. Marius in  December, B.C. 52, alludes to the condemnation of Milo, and to the  numerous prosecutions following it. \"Here, in Rome, I am so distracted  by the number of trials, the crowded courts, and the new legislation,  that I daily offer prayers that there may be no intercalation.\"[20]    [Sidenote: Cicero appointed Proconsul of Cilicia, B.C. 51-50.]    When the correspondence opens again in the spring of B.C. 51 an event  has happened, of no particular importance in itself, but of supreme  interest to Cicero, and very fortunate for the readers of the  correspondence. One of Pompey's new laws ordained that no one was to  take a province till the fifth year after laying down his consulship or  praetorship. Pompey broke his own law by keeping his province, the  Spains--his position in regard to them was altogether exceptional--but,  in order to carry out the law in other cases, the senate arranged that  ex-consuls and ex-praetors who had not been to provinces should in turn  draw lots for vacant governorships. Cicero and Bibulus appear to have  been the senior _consulares_ in that position, and with much reluctance  Cicero allowed his name to be cast into the urn. He drew Cilicia and  Bibulus Syria. He says that his motive was a desire to obey the wishes  of the senate. Another motive may have been a desire to be away from  Rome while the controversy as to Caesar's retirement from his province  was settled, and to retrieve a position of some political importance,  which he had certainly not increased during the last few years. When it  came to the actual start, however, he felt all the _gene_ of the  business--the formation and control of his staff, the separation from  friends, and the residence far from the \"light and life\" of Rome, among  officials who were certainly commonplace and probably corrupt, and  amidst a population, perhaps acute and accomplished, but certainly  servile and ill content, and in some parts predatory and barbarous. At  the best, they would be emphatically provincial, in a dreary sense of  the word. He felt unequal to the worry and bore of the whole business,  and reproached himself with the folly of the undertaking. Of course,  this regret is mingled with his usual self-congratulation on the purity  with which he means to manage his province. But even that feeling is not  strong enough to prevent his longing earnestly to have the period of  banishment as short as possible, or to prevent the alarm with which he  hears of a probable invasion by the Parthians. One effect of his almost  two years' absence from Rome was, I think, to deprive him of the power  of judging clearly of the course of events. He had constant intelligence  and excellent correspondents--especially Caelius--still he could not  really grasp what was going on under the surface: and when he returned  to find the civil war on the point of breaking out, he was, after all,  taken by surprise, and had no plan of action ready. This, as well as his  government of the province, will be fully illustrated in the next volume  of the correspondence.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Cicero's Correspondents.]    The persons to whom the chief letters are addressed in this volume,  besides Atticus, are Cicero's brother Quintus and P. Lentulus Spinther.  There are two excellent letters to M. Marius, and one very interesting,  though rather surprising, epistle to L. Lucceius. Others of more than  average interest are to Terentia, M. Fadius Gallus, C. Scribonius Curio,  and Tiro.    [Sidenote: Titus Pomponius Atticus.]    ATTICUS (B.C. 109-32) is a man of whom we should be glad to know more  than we do. He was the friend of all the leading men of the day--Pompey,  Caesar, Cicero, Antony, Brutus--father-in-law of Agrippa, and survived to  be a constant correspondent of Augustus, between B.C. 43 and his death  in B.C. 32. He was spared and respected by both sides in the civil  wars, from Sulla to the Second Triumvirate. The secret of his success  seems to have been that he was no man's rival. He resolutely declined  all official employment, even on the staff of his brother-in-law Quintus  Cicero. He committed himself to no side in politics, and, not being in  the senate, had no occasion by vote or speech to wound the feelings of  anyone. So, too, though he cared for literature, it was rather as a  friendly critic of others than as an author. He did, it is true, compile  some books on Roman history, on historical portraits, and certain family  biographies; but they were not such as made him a rival of any of his  contemporaries. They were rather the productions of a rich amateur, who  had leisure to indulge a quasi-literary taste, without any thought of  joining the ranks of professed writers. Thirdly, he had great wealth,  partly inherited, partly acquired by prudent speculation in the purchase  of town properties, or in loans to states or public bodies on fair  terms: and this wealth was at the service of his friends, but not in the  lavish or reckless manner, which often earns only ingratitude without  being of any"]]]
