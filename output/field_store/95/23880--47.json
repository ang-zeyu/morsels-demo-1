The order of battles,  too, will be changed altogether; and we shall depend more upon  foot, while our horse, until now almost invincible, will become of  secondary importance.    \"However, that is not the question, at present. The first thing to  be considered is, to which of the three great leaders you are to  attach yourself. As you know, I was for many years in Scindia's  service; but at his death the position was changed. Scindia knew  that I was active and capable; had he lived, I should soon have  gained much promotion. However, his chief minister took a dislike  to me; and I felt that, now the Maharajah was gone, Doulut would be  easily swayed by the counsels of those around him; and that instead  of promotion I should be more likely to lose my command, and  perhaps be put out of the way. Therefore I left Doulut's service,  and have entered that of the young Peishwa who, at the advice of  Nana Furnuwees, has given me the command of a troop of a hundred  men.    \"Years ago I gained Nana's goodwill, by apprising him of the  hostile intentions of the Rajah of Nagpore; when he promised me  that, should I at any time leave Scindia's service, he would give  me as good a position as I held there in that of the Peishwa. The  young prince is but twenty-one, and I will ask Nana to present you  to him as one who, in time, will become a valuable officer; and it  is likely that Mahdoo Rao will receive you well when he hears that,  though so young, you have gained great credit as a slayer of wild  beasts; and that, as he will see for himself, you promise to grow  into a strong man, and a brave soldier.    \"Nana Furnuwees is a man who, by his conciliating manner, gains the  confidence of all who come under his influence; and it is wholly  due to him that the authority of the Peishwa has not been entirely  overthrown by Scindia and Holkar. He is a reader of men's minds,  and has always surrounded himself with friends of discernment and  courage; and I think you would be likely, if you remained in the  Peishwa's service, to rise to a very much higher rank than I should  ever do, being myself but a rough soldier with a heavy hand.    \"Holkar, at present, is fast becoming altogether imbecile. He is  worn out both in mind and body, and I should not advise anybody to  join him. Therefore the choice rests between Doulut Rao Scindia and  the Peishwa; as far as I can see, there is an equal chance of your  seeing service with either.\"    \"I can choose without hesitation,\" Harry said. \"Had you still been  in the army of Scindia, I would have joined it, too; but as you  have now entered that of the Peishwa, who is the lawful ruler of  the Mahrattas, though overshadowed by Scindia and Holkar, I should  certainly choose his service.    \"In any case, I would rather be with you. You have taught me the  use of arms, and to you I owe it that I was not killed, when an  infant; therefore I would assuredly rather fight under your orders,  than take service with Holkar or Scindia.    \"As to their quarrels, I know nothing. Ramdass has often told me as  much as he knew of these matters, but it all seemed to me to be  confusion; and the only thing I could understand was that they were  always intriguing against each other, instead of putting all their  forces in the field, and fighting it out fairly, and so deciding  who was to be the chief lord of the Mahrattas.\"    \"Although but a soldier, Puntojee, I cannot but see that this  constant antagonism, between the three principal leaders of the  Mahrattas, is unfortunate in the last degree. We are wasting the  strength that, if properly employed, might bring all India into  subjection and, when trouble really comes, we shall be a divided  people, instead of acting under one head and with one mind.  However, it is not for us soldiers to meddle with these things; but  to do our duty to the chief under whom we serve.    \"Well, if such be your choice, I will present you to Nana  Furnuwees. I am glad that you have chosen that service for, in the  first place, being young, he may take a liking to you, and you may  obtain rapid promotion; and still more, because I should prefer to  have you with me.\"    Hitherto, Harry had worn only the scanty clothing in use by the  peasantry, and the small cultivators; but Sufder now bought him  clothes such as were worn by youths of a superior class. Soyera had  offered no objection to his departure and, indeed, Sufder had  spoken to her on the subject, before he had broached it to Harry.    \"'Tis hard upon me to give you up,\" she said to the lad; \"but I  have always known that it must be so, and indeed, for the last year  I have seen little of you. The change will be good for you. You  will learn the manner of war, and take an interest in the intrigues  and troubles that are constantly going on, and of which we hear  little.    \"When you rejoin your countrymen, a few years hence, I shall go  with you. You need my testimony, to show that you are the son of  Major Lindsay; and I can be useful to you, in managing your  household. But at present it is best that I should stay here. A  young soldier would not care to have his mother looking after him,  and it is for your good that you should go your own way; and  besides, you will have the counsels of Sufder to aid you. I should  be out of place and, for the present, I am happy here with my good  brother and sister-in-law, the latter of whom would miss me sorely.  Moreover, Poona is but two days' ride from here, and you will no  doubt be able sometimes to come over and see us.    \"I have done what little I could for you. You are now old enough to  make your own way. The bird that has taught its nestling to fly  does not try to keep it in the nest, when it is once able to take  care of itself.\"    \"I can never be sufficiently grateful, for all that you have done  for me,\" Harry said earnestly. \"You have been more than a mother to  me and, wherever I go, I shall not be happy unless you are with me,  though I see it is best, this time, that I should go alone; but  assuredly, when I join my people, and have a home of my own, it  would not seem like a home to me if you did not share it.\"    Two days later, Harry mounted a horse that Ramdass had given him,  and started with Sufder for Poona. On arriving there they rode to  the little camp, half a mile out of the town, where Sufder's troop  was stationed.    \"You don't carry your tents with you, when you are on service in  the field?\"    \"Not when on an expedition where haste is needed; for we should  make but poor progress, if we were hampered by luggage. When on a  distant expedition, we take tents.    \"This is a standing camp, and there are a score like it round the  town. They always remain in the same position; sometimes one troop  occupies them, sometimes another. When we go on an expedition, we  leave them; when we come back, if they are still unoccupied, we  again take possession. If they have been allotted to another troop,  a vacant one is found for us.    \"Only one regiment of horse and two of foot are in the city, where  they have lines of huts. We differ from the rest of the army, being  always on service; the others are only called out when there is  occasion for them, each under its own chief and, in case of  necessity, the Peishwa can put thirty thousand horsemen in the  field, besides those of the rajahs in alliance with him.\"    The next morning Sufder, in his best attire, went with Harry into  the city; the latter for the first time carrying a sword, dagger  and pistols in his cummerbund, or sash. Without being questioned,  they entered the chamber were Nana was giving audience to all who  waited upon him on business.    Sufder took his place at the lower end of the chamber, moving  forward as one after another applicant was disposed of until, at  length, his turn arrived. The minister, who knew that he was a  brave soldier, who had enjoyed the confidence of the late Scindia,  acknowledged his deep salutation with a friendly nod.    \"What can I do for you, Sufder?\"    \"I desire nothing, your excellency, save that I may be permitted to  present to you one of my family: the son of a relation of mine who,  although still young, I may venture to recommend to you as one  possessing great courage and intelligence. I have myself given him  lessons in the use of his arms; and he has had other instructors,  and done credit to them. For the past year he has been working with  a famous shikaree, and has killed many tigers that were a scourge  to the villages near the Ghauts, together with many bears and  leopards; and his master reported that his fearlessness was great,  and that as a marksman his skill was equal to his own. He was most  unwilling that he should leave him, but I considered it was time  for him to enter the army; in which, I believe, he will soon  distinguish himself.\"    \"How old is he?\" the minister asked.    \"He is as yet but sixteen but, as your highness may see, he is as  strong as most men, having devoted himself to exercises of all  sorts, since he was a child.\"    \"He is indeed cast in a strong mould, and his face pleases me.    \"And so, you would enter the service of His Highness, the Peishwa?\"    \"That is my desire, your excellency.\"    \"You are young to serve as an officer and, for the present, you had  best remain with Sufder's troop. In the meantime, I will see what  suitable post can be found for you.\"    With an expression of thanks, Sufder and Harry left the audience  hall.    \"It is a good beginning, Puntojee,\" the soldier said, as they left  the minister's palace. \"Nana Furnuwees was evidently pleased with  you, and I think he will give you special employment. At the same  time, serving one master here is not without its danger--Nana  especially, powerful as he is, has enemies as powerful; for he has  always stood in the way of the ambition of Scindia.\"    That evening an officer brought, from Nana, an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#8)"],[1,"knows what a difference there  is between the little hard seedy ones that commonly flourish in the  hedges and the big juicy ones with the larger leaves. Nature had been  prodigal here, and a bounteous harvest hung within easy reach.    \"They are as big as mulberries--and oh, such heaps and heaps!\" exclaimed  Addie ecstatically. \"No, Merle, you wretch, this is my branch! Don't  poach, you wretch! Go farther on, can't you!\"    \"I wish we could send the jam to the hospital when it's made,\" sighed  Merle.    The party spread itself out; some of the girls climbed to the top of the  wall, so that they could reach what grew on the sunnier side, and a few  skirted round over a gate into a field, where a ruined cottage was also  covered with brambles. They worked down the lane by slow degrees,  picking hard as they went. At the end a sudden rushing roar struck upon  the ear, and without even waiting for a signal from Miss Moseley the  girls with one accord hopped over a fence, and ran up a slight incline.  The voice of the waterfall was calling, and the impulse to obey was  irresistible. At the top of the slope they stopped, for they had reached  a natural platform that overlooked the gorge. The scene rivalled one of  the beauty-spots of Switzerland. The Porth Powys stream, flowing between  precipitous rocks, fell two hundred feet in a series of four splendid  cascades. The rugged crags on either side were thickly covered with a  forest of fir and larch, and here and there a taller stone-pine reared  its darker head above the silvery green. Dashing, roaring, leaping,  shouting, the water poured down in a never-ceasing volume: the white  spray rose up in clouds, wetting the girls' faces; the sound was like an  endless chorus of hallelujahs.    \"Porth Powys is in fine form to-day. There must have been rain up in the  mountains last night,\" remarked Ulyth. \"What do you think of it, Rona?\"    \"It's a champion! I'm going to climb down there and get at the edge.\"    \"No, you won't!\" said Miss Moseley sharply. \"Nobody is to go a single  step nearer. You must all come back into the lane now, and get on with  blackberry-picking. Your baskets are only half full yet.\"    Very reluctantly the girls followed. The fall exercised a fascination  over them, and they could have stayed half an hour watching its white  swirl. They did not wish, however, to earn the reputation of slackers.  Two other parties had gone out blackberrying that afternoon, and there  would be keen competition as to which would bring back the most pounds.  They set to work again, therefore, with enthusiasm, counting stained  fingers and scratches as glorious wounds earned in the good cause. Rona  picked with zeal, but she had a preoccupied look on her face.    \"Say, I liked that waterfall,\" she remarked to Ulyth. \"One can't see  anything of it down in this old lane. I'm going to get a better view.\"    \"You mustn't go off on your own,\" commanded Ulyth. \"Miss Moseley will  report you if you do!\"    \"Don't excite yourself. I only said I was going to get a better view.  It's quite easy.\"    Rona put her basket in a safe place, and with the aid of a hazel bush  climbed to the top of the wall. Apparently the prospect did not satisfy  her.    \"I'm going a stave higher still. Keep your hair on!\" she shouted down to  Ulyth, and began swarming up the bole of a huge old oak-tree that  abutted on the wall. She was strong and active as a boy, and had soon  scrambled to where the branches forked. A mass of twisted ivy hung here,  and raising herself with its aid, she stood on an outstretched bough.    \"It's ripping! I can see a little bit of the fall; I'll see it better if  I get over on to that other branch.\"    \"Take care!\" called Miss Moseley from below.    Rona started. She had not known the mistress was so near. The movement  upset her decidedly unstable balance; she clutched hard at the ivy, but  it gave way in her fingers; there was a sudden crash and a smothered  shriek.    White as a ghost, Miss Moseley climbed the wall, expecting to find the  prostrate form of her pupil on the other side. To her surprise she saw  nothing of the sort. Near at hand, however, came a stifled groan.    \"Rona, where are you?\" shrieked the distracted governess.    \"Here,\" spluttered the voice of the Cuckoo; \"inside the tree. The  beastly old thing's rotten, and I've tumbled to the very bottom of the  trunk!\"    \"Are you hurt?\"    \"No, nothing to speak of.\"    \"Here's a pretty go!\" murmured the girls, who all came running at the  sound of shouts. \"How's she going to get out again?\"    \"Can't you climb up?\" urged Miss Moseley.    \"No, I can't stir an inch; I'm wedged in somehow.\"    What was to be done? The affair waxed serious. Miss Moseley, with a  really heroic effort, and much help from the girls, managed to scale the  tree and look down into the hollow trunk. She could just see Rona's  scared face peeping up at her many feet below.    \"Can you put up your hand and let me pull you?\"    \"No; I tell you I'm wedged as tight as a sardine.\"    \"We shall have to send for help then. May and Kathleen, run as quickly  as you can down the lane. There's a farm at the bottom of the hill. Tell  them what's the matter.\"    \"I hope to goodness they'll understand English!\" murmured Merle.    \"Will I have to stop here always?\" demanded a tragic voice within the  tree. \"Shall you be able to feed me, or will I have to starve? How long  does it take to die of hunger?\"    \"You won't die just yet,\" returned Miss Moseley, laughing a little in  spite of herself. \"We'll get you out in course of time.\"    \"I guess I'd better make my will, though. Has anybody got a pencil and  paper, and will they please write it down and send it home? I want to  leave my saddle to Pamela Higson, and Jake is to have the bridle and  whip--I always liked him better than Billy, though I pretended I didn't.  Jane Peters may have my writing-desk--much she writes, though!--and  Amabel Holt my old doll. That's all I've left in New Zealand. Ulyth can  take what I've got at school--'twon't be any great shakes to her, I  expect. You didn't tell me how long it takes to die!\"    \"Cheer up! There's not the slightest danger,\" Miss Moseley continued to  assure her.    \"It's all very well to say 'cheer up' when you're standing safe on the  top,\" said the gloomy voice of the imprisoned dryad. \"It feels a  different matter when you're boxed up tight with tree all round you.  It's jolly uncomfortable. Where are the girls?\"    \"Here's one,\" replied Ulyth, climbing the tree to relieve poor Miss  Moseley, who gladly retired in her favour. \"I'm going to stay and talk  to you till somebody comes to get you out. Oh, here are May and Kathleen  at last! What a fearful time they've been!\"    The two messengers came panting back with many excuses for their delay.  It was a long way down the lane to the farm, and when they arrived there  they had considerable difficulty in explaining their errand. No one  could understand English except a little boy, who was only half-able to  translate their remarks into Welsh. They had at length made the farmer  realize what had happened, and he had promised to come at once. In the  course of a few minutes they were followed by David Jones and his son,  Idwal, bearing a rope, an axe, and a saw, and looking rather dismayed at  the task in store for them. It proved indeed a matter of considerable  difficulty to rescue Rona without hurting her; a portion of the  tree-trunk was obliged to be sawn away before she could obtain  sufficient room to help to free herself, and it was only after an hour's  hard work that she stood at last in safety on the ground.    \"How do you feel?\" asked Miss Moseley anxiously, fearing broken bones or  a sprain from the final effort of extraction.    \"Well, I guess it's taken the bounce out of me. I'm as stiff as a  rheumatic cat! Oh, I'll get back to school somehow, don't alarm  yourself! I'm absolutely starving for tea. Good-bye, you wood-demon; you  nearly finished me!\" and Rona shook her fist at the offending oak-tree  as a parting salute.    \"She called it demon to rhyme with lemon!\" gurgled Addie, almost sobbing  with mirth as she followed, holding Merle's arm. \"The Cuckoo will cause  me to break a blood-vessel some day. It hurts me most dreadfully to  laugh. I've got a stitch in my side. Oh dear! I wonder whatever she'll  go and do next?\"          CHAPTER V    On Sufferance          \"Scratch, scratch, scratch,       Scratch went the old black hen!       Every fowl that scrapes in the barn       Can scratch as well as your pen!\"    So sang Rona, bounding noisily one afternoon into No. 3, Room 5, and  popping her hands from behind over Ulyth's eyes as the latter sat  writing at a table near the window.    \"What are you always scratching away for? Can't you finish your work at  prep.? Why don't you come downstairs and play basket-ball? You're mighty  studious all of a sudden. What have you got here?\"    Ulyth flushed crimson with annoyance, and turned her sheets of foolscap  hastily over to hide them from her room-mate's prying eyes.    \"You're not to touch my papers, Rona! I've told you that before.\"    \"Well, I wasn't touching them. Looking's not touching, anyway. What are  you doing? It's queer taste to sit scribbling here half your spare  time.\"    \"What I was doing is my own concern, and no business of yours.\"    \"Now you're riled,\" said the Cuckoo, sitting down easily on her bed. \"I  didn't mean any harm. I always seem sticking my foot into it somehow.\"    Ulyth sighed. Nobody in the school realized how much she had to put up  with from her irrepressible room-mate, whose hearty voice, extraordinary  expressions, and broad notions of fun grated upon her sensitive nature.  Rona did not appreciate in the least the heroic sacrifice that Ulyth was  making. It had never occurred to her that she might be placed in another  dormitory, and that she only remained on sufferance in No. 3. She "]]]
