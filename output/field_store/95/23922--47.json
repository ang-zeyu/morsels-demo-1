I dare  say you think I am an old woman,\" he said as he saw her smile, \"and that  my fears are groundless, but you will agree that your own experience of  last week will support the theory that anything may happen in London.\"    \"But really, Mr. Glover, you don't mean that I am in any serious  danger--from whom?\"    \"From a lot of people,\" he said diplomatically.    \"From poor Miss Briggerland?\" she challenged, and his eyes narrowed.    \"Poor Miss Briggerland,\" he said softly. \"She certainly is poorer than  she expected to be.\"    \"Nonsense,\" scoffed the girl. She was irritated, which was unusual in  her. \"My dear Mr. Glover, why do you pursue your vendetta against her?  Do you think it is playing the game, honestly now? Isn't it a case of  wounded vanity on your part?\"    He stared at her in astonishment.    \"Wounded vanity? Do you mean pique?\"    She nodded.    \"Why should I be piqued?\" he asked slowly.    \"You know best,\" replied Lydia, and then a light dawned on him.    \"Have I been making love to Miss Briggerland by any chance?\" he asked.    \"You know best,\" she repeated.    \"Good Lord!\" and then he began to laugh, and she thought he would never  stop.    \"I suppose I made love to her, and she was angry because I dared to  commit such an act of treachery to her fiance! Yes, that was it. I made  love to her behind poor Jim's back, and she 'ticked me off,' and that's  why I'm so annoyed with her?\"    \"You have a very good memory,\" said Lydia, with a scornful little smile.    \"My memory isn't as good as Miss Briggerland's power of invention,\" said  Jack. \"Doesn't it strike you, Mrs. Meredith, that if I had made love to  that young lady, I should not be seen here to-day?\"    \"What do you mean?\" she asked.    \"I mean,\" said Jack Glover soberly, \"that it would not have been  Bulford, but I, who would have been lured from his club by a telephone  message, and told to wait outside the door in Berkeley Street. It would  have been I, who would have been shot dead by Miss Briggerland's father  from the drawing-room window.\"    The girl looked at him in amazement.    \"What a preposterous charge to make!\" she said at last indignantly. \"Do  you suggest that this girl has connived at a murder?\"    \"I not only suggest that she connived at it, but I stake my life that  she planned it,\" said Jack carefully.    \"But the pistol was found near Mr. Bulford's body,\" said Lydia almost  triumphantly, as she conceived this unanswerable argument.    Jack nodded.    \"From Bulford's body to the drawing-room window was exactly nine feet.  It was possible to pitch the pistol so that it fell near him. Bulford  was waiting there by the instructions of Jean Briggerland. We have  traced the telephone call that came through to him from the club--it  came from the Briggerlands' house in Berkeley Street, and the attendant  at the club was sure it was a woman's voice. We didn't find that out  till after the trial. Poor Meredith was in the hall when the shot was  fired. The signal was given when he turned the handle to let himself  out. He heard the shot, rushed down the steps and saw the body. Whether  he picked up the pistol or not, I do not know. Jean Briggerland swears  he had it in his hand, but, of course, Jean Briggerland is a hopeless  liar!\"    \"You can't know what you're saying,\" said Lydia in a low voice. \"It is a  dreadful charge to make, dreadful, against a girl whose very face  refutes such an accusation.\"    \"Her face is her fortune,\" snapped Jack, and then penitently, \"I'm sorry  I'm rude, but somehow the very mention of Jean Briggerland arouses all  that is worst in me. Now, you will accept Jaggs, won't you?\"    \"Who is he?\" she asked.    \"He is an old army pensioner. A weird bird, as shrewd as the dickens, in  spite of his age a pretty powerful old fellow.\"    \"Oh, he's old,\" she said with some relief.    \"He's old, and in some ways, incapacitated. He hasn't the use of his  right arm, and he's a bit groggy in one of his ankles as the result of  a Boer bullet.\"    She laughed in spite of herself.    \"He doesn't sound a very attractive kind of guardian. He's a perfectly  clean old bird, though I confess he doesn't look it, and he won't bother  you or your servants. You can give him a room where he can sit, and you  can give him a bit of bread and cheese, and a glass of beer, and he'll  not bother you.\"    Lydia was amused now. It was absurd that Jack Glover should imagine she  needed a guardian at all, but if he insisted, as he did, it would be  better to have somebody as harmless as the unattractive Jaggs.    \"What time will he come?\"    \"At about ten o'clock every night, and he'll leave you at about seven in  the morning. Unless you wish, you need never see him,\" said Jack.    \"How did you come to know him?\" she asked curiously.    \"I know everybody,\" said the boastful young man, \"you mustn't forget  that I am a lawyer and have to meet very queer people.\"    He gathered up his papers and put them into his little bag.    \"And now what are your plans for to-day?\" he demanded.    She resented the self-imposed guardianship which he had undertaken, yet  she could not forget what she owed him.    By some extraordinary means he had kept her out of the Meredith case and  she had not been called as a witness at the inquest. Incidentally, in as  mysterious a way he had managed to whitewash his partner and himself,  although the Law Society were holding an inquiry of their own (this the  girl did not know) it seemed likely that he would escape the consequence  of an act which was a flagrant breach of the law.    \"I am going to Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's to tea,\" she said.    \"Mrs. Cole-Mortimer?\" he said quickly. \"How do you come to know that  lady?\"    \"Really, Mr. Glover, you are almost impertinent,\" she smiled in spite of  her annoyance. \"She came to call on me two or three days after that  dreadful morning. She knew Mr. Meredith and was an old friend of the  family's.\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" said Jack icily, \"she did not know Meredith,  except to say 'how-do-you-do' to him, and she was certainly not a friend  of the family. She is, however, a friend of Jean Briggerland.\"    \"Jean Briggerland!\" said the exasperated girl. \"Can't you forget her?  You are like the man in Dickens's books--she's your King Charles's head!  Really, for a respectable and a responsible lawyer, you're simply eaten  up with prejudices. Of course, she was a friend of Mr. Meredith's. Why,  she brought me a photograph of him taken when he was at Eton.\"    \"Supplied by Jean Briggerland,\" said the unperturbed Jack calmly, \"and  if she'd brought you a pair of socks he wore when he was a baby I  suppose you would have accepted those too.\"    \"Now you are being really abominable,\" said the girl, \"and I've got a  lot to do.\"    He paused at the door.    \"Don't forget you can move into Cavendish Mansions to-morrow. I'll send  the key round, and the day you move in, Jaggs will turn up for duty,  bright and smiling. He doesn't talk a great deal----\"    \"I don't suppose you ever give the poor man a chance,\" she said  cuttingly.          Chapter IX      Mrs. Cole-Mortimer was a representative of a numerous class of women who  live so close to the border-line which separates good society from  society which is not quite as good, that the members of either set  thought she was in the other. She had a small house where she gave big  parties, and nobody quite knew how this widow of an Indian colonel made  both ends meet. It was the fact that her menage was an expensive one to  maintain; she had a car, she entertained in London in the season, and  disappeared from the metropolis when it was the correct thing to  disappear, a season of exile which comes between the Goodwood Race  Meeting in the south and the Doncaster Race Meeting in the north.    Lydia had been surprised to receive a visit from this elegant lady, and  had readily accepted the story of her friendship with James Meredith.  Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's invitation she had welcomed. She needed some  distraction, something which would smooth out the ravelled threads of  life which were now even more tangled than she had ever expected they  could be.    Mr. Rennett had handed to her a thousand pounds the day after the  wedding, and when she had recovered from the shock of possessing such a  large sum, she hired a taxicab and indulged herself in a wild orgy of  shopping.    The relief she experienced when he informed her he was taking charge of  her affairs and settling the debts which had worried her for three years  was so great that she felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from  her heart.    It was in one of her new frocks that Lydia, feeling more confident than  usual, made her call. She had expected to find a crowd at the house in  Hyde Park Crescent, and she was surprised when she was ushered into the  drawing-room to find only four people present.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer was a chirpy, pale little woman of forty-something.  It would be ungallant to say how much that \"something\" represented. She  came toward Lydia with outstretched hands.    \"My dear,\" she said with extravagant pleasure, \"I am glad you were able  to come. You know Miss Briggerland and Mr. Briggerland?\"    Lydia looked up at the tall figure of the man she had seen in the stalls  the night before her wedding and recognised him instantly.    \"Mr. Marcus Stepney, I don't think you have met.\"    Lydia bowed to a smart looking man of thirty, immaculately attired. He  was very handsome, she thought, in a dark way, but he was just a little  too \"new\" to please her. She did not like fashion-plate men, and  although the most captious of critics could not have found fault with  his correct attire, he gave her the impression of being over-dressed.    Lydia had not expected to meet Miss Briggerland and her father, although  she had a dim recollection that Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had mentioned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21531"],[0,"Woodwork Joints: How They Are Set Out, How Made and Where Used. (#8)"],[1," circular or straight top rail. The inlaid leg in this case is  stump-tenoned into the top rail, and the inlaid portion of the leg is  allowed to run through the rail, thus giving continuity of design.    Fig. 142 shows the application of the haunched tenon (Fig. 135) to the  making of a skylight or garden frame. In this and similar cases the side  rails are rebated as shown in the section, and the bottom rail is thinner  than the side rails to allow the glass to finish level upon it.    LONG AND SHORT SHOULDERED JOINT.--Fig. 143 shows a haunched mortise and  tenon joint having a long and short shoulder. This is a fairly common  joint in framed partitions for offices, framing for greenhouses, tool  sheds, etc., and is a frequent source of annoyance to the amateur. It is  necessary to use this joint when both the stiles and uprights are  rebated, and it calls for accurate marking out and great care in the  making.    [Illustration: Fig. 144.--Joint for Fencing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 145.--Example of Faulty Tenon.]    Fig. 144 shows the upright and rails of common garden or field fencing.  The tenons are bevelled to fit and wedge each other in the mortise. The  illustration gives both cross rails as shouldered, but in many cases  shoulders are omitted when the rails are not thick enough to carry them.    Fig. 145 indicates faulty methods of working a tenon. At A the saw has  been allowed to run too far when cutting the shoulder, thus greatly  weakening the tenon. At B faulty sawing has again occurred, and to remedy  this defect the worker has resorted to paring the shoulder with a chisel.  Had the chisel been used vertically an undercut shoulder (as at B) would  not have occurred. The trouble now is that the slightest amount of  shrinkage in the width of the stile will show an open joint. The result  will be the same if it is necessary to remove a shaving or two when  planing or levelling up the face of the frame.    [Illustration: Fig. 146.--Self-wedging Japanese Tenon Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 147.--Tenoned and Scribed Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 148.--Mitred and Moulded Tenon Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 149.--Twin Tenons.]    A JAPANESE TENONED JOINT, little known and rarely used in this country,  is shown at Fig. 146. For clearness the two parts are here shown  separate. The joint is self-wedging and will be of interest to Handicraft  Instructors.    A TENONED AND SCRIBED JOINT is seen at Fig. 147. The cross rail is cut at  the shoulder, so as to fit the moulding which is worked on the stile.  This is a good joint in everyday use.    MITRED AND MOULDED JOINT.--Fig. 148 shows a type of joint largely used in  light cabinet work. The method of mitreing the moulding and tenoning the  stile to rail is indicated.    TWIN TENONS (Fig. 149).--The method of tenoning the bearers which carry  the drawers, or the midfeather between two drawers, in a dressing table  or similar carcase is here shown. On completion, the tenons on the  midfeather are wedged diagonally.    [Illustration: Fig 150.--Method of Pinning.]    [Illustration: Fig. 151.--Joining Top Rails to Upright Post.]    PINNING.--Fig. 150 shows the tenoning of the inside end of a wardrobe to  the top of the carcase. This is also called pinning. The tenons should be  wedged diagonally. The tenons and the distance between the tenons are  more satisfactory if made equidistant, because if slight shrinkage occurs  this is partially equalised. The width between the tenons should in no  case exceed 3 ins.    TOP RAILS.--At Fig. 151 is shown the method of joining the top rails to  the post of a tool shed or similar outhouse. The two rails, which are at  right angles to each other, are half-lapped and mortised; the tenon on  the post runs entirely through them.    A TUSK TENON JOINT, with wedge, as used to secure the binder to the  girder when making floors, is indicated at Fig. 153. The tenon here is  narrow and engages the mortise, which is situated in the compressional  fibres immediately adjoining the neutral layer. Fig. 152 shows a tusk  tenon furnished with a drawbore pin.    [Illustration: Fig. 152.--Tusk Tenon.]    [Illustration: Fig. 153.--Wedged Tusk Tenon.]    Fig. 154 is a variation of Fig. 152.    Fig. 155 shows tusk and wedged tenons as used when making a portable book  or medicine cabinet. The shelf is housed into the end, and the tenons run  through the end and are secured by wedges. This allows the article to be  quickly and easily taken to pieces for removal or re-polishing. The  dotted line in Fig. 155 indicates that the shelf may be shaped if  desired.    [Illustration: Fig. 154.--Another Type of Tusk Tenon.]    [Illustration: Fig. 155.--Tusk Tenon and Wedge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 156.--Wheelwright's Self-wedging Tenon Joint.]    In Fig. 156 a self-wedging mortise and tenon joint used by wheelwrights  is shown. The dotted line (left-hand diagram) will indicate the amount of  taper given to the mortise.    DOVETAILED AND WEDGED TENON (Fig. 157).--When two pieces such as the  cross rail and leg of a carpenter's bench are required to be held  together by a mortise and tenon, and to be readily taken apart, the tenon  is dovetailed on one side and the mortise is made of sufficient width to  permit the widest part of the dovetailed tenon to pass into it. When the  tenon is in its position a hardwood wedge is driven in above the tenon,  as shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 157.--Dovetailed and Wedged Tenon.]    [Illustration: Fig. 158.--Method of Fox-wedging.]    FOX WEDGED TENON (Fig. 158).--This is the method of securing a stub tenon  by small wedges. The mortise is slightly dovetailed and two saw cuts are  made in the tenon about 3/16 in. from each side. Into each saw kerf a  wedge is inserted and the joint glued up. The cramping operation forces  the wedges into the saw cuts, thus causing the end of the tenon to spread  and tightly grip the mortise.    MORTISE AND TENON WITH MITRED FACE (Fig. 159).--This is a useful method  of jointing framing which has square edges as shown; and it is equally  useful even if the face edges have moulds worked upon them. If the joint  has square edges a rebate may be formed to accommodate a panel by fixing  a bolection moulding around the frame. A section of the bolection mould  planted on the frame is shown in the lower figure.    [Illustration: Fig. 159.--Tenon Joint with Mitred Face.]    [Illustration: Fig. 160.--Rafter Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 161.--Roof Joints.]    ROOF JOINTS.--Fig. 160 shows the method of tenoning the principal rafter  to the king post, whilst Fig. 161 illustrates the tenoning of the struts  to the king post, and the king post to the tie beam. Both these examples  are used in roof work. (See also Fig. 71.)    [Illustration: Fig. 162.--Drawbore Pinning.]    [Illustration: Fig. 163., Fig. 164. Operation of Pegs in  Drawbore Pinning.]    DRAWBORE PINNING.--At Fig. 162 is seen the method of securing a tenon by  drawbore pinning, employed when it is not convenient to obtain the  necessary pressure by using a cramp. The joint is made in the usual  manner, and a 3/8-in. twist bit is used to bore a hole through piece A.  The tenon is driven home and the hole is marked on the side of the tenon  (B); the tenon is then withdrawn and the hole bored about 1/8 in. nearer  to the shoulder than as marked on the separate diagram at C. When the  tenon is finally inserted the holes will not register correctly, and if a  hardwood pin be driven into the joint it will draw the shoulders of the  tenon to a close joint and effectually secure the parts.    SASH BARS.--Fig. 165 shows how to tenon a moulded sash bar to the rebated  cross rail. In this illustration both shoulders of the moulded bar are  shown square, but in the best class work these shoulders may be slightly  housed into the cross rail to prevent side play. This type of joint is  used for horticultural buildings, etc. If the lower rail be moulded with  the same members as the sash bar, the end of the sash bar will have to be  scribed on to it to make a fit.    [Illustration: Fig. 165.--Tenoning Moulded Sash Bar.]    [Illustration: Fig. 166.--Tenon with Tongued and Grooved Shoulder.]    [Illustration: Fig. 167.--Detail of Table Framing.]    TENON WITH TONGUED AND GROOVED SHOULDERS (Fig. 166).--The object of the  tongues and grooves here is to prevent the face of the work casting, or  becoming warped, and thus spoiling the appearance of the surface of the  work. If framing is to be veneered on the face side this is an  exceptionally good method.    TABLE FRAMING.--Fig. 167 indicates the framing of a rail to a  dining-table leg. In cases similar to this the tenons run into the leg  and almost touch each other. They are therefore mitred on the end as  shown in the inset. Chair frames often call for similar treatment.    TWIN TENONS with haunch, as used when the timber is of great thickness,  are shown in Fig. 168.    AN OPEN SLOT MORTISE at the end of a right-angled frame is seen in Fig.  169. Fig. 170 shows an open slot mortise and tenon joint at the end of a  frame of 60 deg.. Both these joints are occasionally called end bridle  joints.    [Illustration: Fig. 168.--Twin Tenons for Thick Timber.]    [Illustration: Fig. 169.--The Open-slot Mortise Joint.]    HAMMER HEAD TENONS.--At Fig. 171 is shown the method of jointing framing  having semicircular or segmental heads. The left-hand diagram indicates  the method of wedging the joint so as to draw up the shoulders; the  right-hand view shows the tongueing of the shoulders, which is necessary  if thick timber has to be wrought. The sketch depicts the stile when  taken apart from the shaped head of the frame.    CLAMPING.--Fig. 172 shows the method of tenoning drawing boards, desk  tops and secretaire falls. This is commonly called clamping. The method  is used to prevent wide surfaces from winding. A variation of the joint  is shown at the left-hand side, the corners in this example not being  "]]]
