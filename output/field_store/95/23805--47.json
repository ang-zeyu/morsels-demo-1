It is not to be wondered at that such an operation should not  have been sooner discovered, for even at the present time there are  few processes in treating material which seem so anomalous as that of  planing a flat surface with cutters revolving in a circle of a few  inches in diameter.    In reference to planing mouldings, it is said: \"If the circumference  of a circular cutter be formed in the shape of any moulding, and  projecting above the bench no more than necessary, the piece being  shoved over the cutter will thus be cut to a moulding corresponding to  the cutter--that is, the reverse of it, just as a plane iron cuts the  reverse. If a plane cutter, such as that above spoken of for cutting a  groove in the breadth of a piece, be made so thick, or, as we might be  apt to say now, so broad, or so long, as to cover the whole breadth of  the piece, it will present the idea of a roller. This I call a cutting  roller; it maybe employed in many cases with great advantage to  perform the office of a plane.\"    The cutting roller of Bentham is the present cutter block of England,  or the cutting cylinder of America, and after what has been quoted it  may be seen that the idea of rotary planing and moulding machines had  been fully grasped by Bentham. He goes on as usual to the various  conditions which attach to the process of planing, and says further:  \"if a cutting roller of this sort be placed with its axis horizontal  and the bench beneath, it may be made to rise and lower. The bench  (machine) may be very readily adjusted, so as to determine the  thickness to which a piece will be reduced by being passed under the  roller.\" \"To gain time, cutters may be applied to different sides of a  piece at once, and such of them as make parallel cuts may be mounted  on the same spindle.\"    These extracts would not be out of place in an explanatory lecture or  essay on woodcutting at the present day, and cannot help awakening  surprise that they should have been written eighty-three years ago,  when there had, so far as we know, been no precedents, nor even  suggestions from previous practice.    The foregoing shows that nearly all the fundamental principles, upon  which woodcutting by machinery in its present development depends,  were familiar to Sir Samuel Bentham, and though his name has been  almost forgotten, it may be safely asserted that he gave to the world  more useful inventions than any other man of his age. His work shows  throughout a constant method and system of reasoning, which point  rather to a life of persistent labor than to one of what would  ordinarily be called genius. That latter quality he must certainly  have possessed in the highest degree, for without it even his  knowledge and experience could not have been equal to the work he  accomplished. Directed to different ends, his talent and genius would  doubtless have secured for him a fame that would live for years,  though it does not seem possible that he could have conferred upon the  world a greater benefit.           *       *       *       *       *          SUICIDE STATISTICS.      A curious and suggestive table of statistics has recently appeared in  France, which will doubtless prove of much value in the hands of  students of psychology and nervous mental ailments. It relates to  suicides; and the conditions, etc., of the people who made away with  themselves in 1874 in France are taken as the basis of the figures. In  that year, 5,617 suicides occurred, the largest number ever known in  any one year in the country. Of these, 4,435, or 79 per cent., were  committed by men, 1,182, or 21 per cent., by women. In spite of the  careful investigations of the police, the ages of 105 people could be  determined. The 5,512 others are divided as follows: 16 years, 29;  between 16 and 21 years, 193; between 21 and 40 years, 1,477; between  40 and 60 years, 2,214; exceeding the last mentioned age, 1,599. About  36 per cent. of these unfortunates were unmarried, 48 per cent.  married, and 16 per cent. widowers. Of those which constituted the  last two classes, nearly two thirds had children. More than seven  tenths of the suicides were effected by strangulation or drowning. The  crime was most frequently committed during spring, when 31 per cent.  of the whole number destroyed themselves; during other seasons the  percentages were: in summer, 27; in winter, 23; in autumn, 19.    Included in the tables are the results of the judicial inquests,  showing the professions and callings of the deceased. About 33 per  cent. were farmers, 30 per cent. mechanics, 4 per cent. merchants or  business men, 16 per cent. members of the liberal professions, 4 per  cent. servants, and 13 percent. were destitute of any calling. The  table even analyzes, in all but 481 people, the motives which caused  the fatal act. Thus we are told that 652 killed themselves because of  reverses in fortune, 701 through family troubles, 572 through  drunkenness, 243 through love, debauchery, etc.; 798 died to avoid  physical suffering, 59 to avoid the penalties of capital crimes, 489  for unclassified troubles, and 1,622 were clearly shown to have been  afflicted with some mental disease.           *       *       *       *       *          COMMUNICATIONS.                 *       *       *       *       *      THE FROST PLANT OF RUSSIA.    _To the Editor of the Scientific American:_    Mr. Charles Williams, of Winoa, Ohio, has written a letter to that  veteran botanist, Humphrey Marshall, of Chester county, Pa., on the  subject of the abovenamed plant, and my opinion concerning it has been  asked for. Seeds of this plant were obtained by citizens of Boston,  who had snow brought from the White Mountains and from the coast of  Labrador, and who stated that they have \"now the most unbounded  satisfaction and pleasure of announcing that all signs are favorable  to the realization of their fondest hopes.\" This wonderful plant, it  seems, was found amid the perpetual snows of the northern boundaries  of Siberia, in 1863, by Count Swinoskoff, the eminent Russian  botanist, and it was by him cultivated at St. Petersburgh. The account  sent me is very vague, and is evidently not from the pen of a  botanist. It is stated that it comes forth on the first day of the  year, grows to the height of three feet, and flowers on the third day.  It continues in bloom for twenty-four hours, then dissolves itself,  being of the finest snow; it has a stalk one inch in diameter, and  leaves, three in number, 11/2 inches wide, covered with infinitesimal  frost or snow cones. The flower is of the shape of a star, with petals  3 inches long and 1/2 inch wide at the broadest part, forming a  basketwork of frost. The seeds are like a pin's head. This is about  all that can be gleaned from the description, and is by no means  satisfactory. Allow me to present my humble views of an analogous  discovery of frostwork on December 6, 1856, in a sandy loam in Chester  county, Pa., near the Paoli monument. In the _Horticultural Journal_  of Philadelphia, then edited by J. Jay Smith (New Series, volume vii.,  page 73, 1857), an account was published of my observations then.  These I have since more fully confirmed. The common dittany (cunila  Mariana) is frequently met with in December, with the base of the stem  surrounded with shellwork of ice, of a pearly whiteness. Dr.  Darlington, in his \"Flora Cestrica\" published in 1853, page 199, under  the article cunila, observes: \"In the beginning of winter, after a  rain, very curious ribbons of ice may be observed, attached to the  base of the stems, produced, I presume, by the moisture of the earth  rising in the dead stems by capillary attraction, and then being  gradually forced out horizontally, through a slit, by the process of  freezing. The same phenomenon has been observed in other plants. See  observations on _helianthemum_, page 27.\" Had the doctor given a more  extended investigation, I fancy he would have agreed with me as to the  cause. I found hundreds of diversified specimens. I am not aware that  it was after a rain, but I took up a number of the plants, and always  found a vigorous scaly root bud, undergoing development at this early  season under ground, to produce a new stem the following spring. I  came to the conclusion that, as the temperature was below freezing and  snow was on the ground, the expanding bud, in close proximity to the  surface, gave out sufficient caloric or warmth to generate vapor from  the moist soil. This vapor rising around the stem of the plant, and  attracted by it, becomes congealed into what we term hoar-frost, in  numerous forms; some like shellwork, others like tulips, with radiated  petals, variously contorted, and often as symmetrical as snowflake  crystals.

But a petition, dated 1298, states that the old nave had long since  fallen (_diu est corruita_). If this were so there was no object in  refraining from disturbing the old work. It is uncertain whether the  nave had been purposely destroyed, or had fallen of its own weight. It  may be, though we have no record of the fact, that Thomas's Norman tower  fell down, as did so many Norman central towers, destroying with it some  part of the nave, and so made the rebuilding of that part of the church  necessary.    The nave is fully developed geometrical Decorated work. It is loftier  than the transepts, and its roof is low pitched. The main part of the  rebuilding seems to have been done between 1298 and 1320. The indenture  for glazing the great west window is still extant, and is dated 1338.  The nave must have been roofed before this.    The vault was probably intended to be stone, but the great width of the  building seems to have made the builders afraid, and they erected a  vault of wood, but shaped and ribbed to look like stone. The outer walls  of the clerestory, and the pinnacles of the south side of the nave show  vestiges of flying buttresses. It is uncertain whether these were merely  intended when a stone vault was projected, or whether they were actually  erected, and afterwards, being unnecessary for the support of a wooden  vault, were allowed to fall into disrepair. There are no flying  buttresses on the north side, and the pinnacles are much smaller.    The west front was undoubtedly the latest part of the work to be  finished, except the vault. The lowest stages, though geometrical in  style, are later in character than the nave itself. The great west  window, and the upper stages are of florid curvilinear Gothic. The west  front is said to have been finished, and the great west window glazed by  Archbishop Melton, who gave 500 or 600 marks to the fabric in 1338. The  church was vaulted in 1354; Archbishop Thoresby is said to have given  the wood. Before the beginning of the nave, the relics of St. William  had been carried into the choir, and installed there with great pomp.  The offerings of the faithful at his shrine helped to defray the expense  of the building. Further funds were gained by means of indulgences  granted by successive archbishops. The houses of Vavasour and Percy gave  wood and stone, and statues of their representatives were placed over  the main porch of the west front.    The date of the chapter-house, and the passage connecting it with the  north transept is disputed. Browne thinks it was begun about 1280, and  finished about 1340. He partly bases his contention on the fact that the  Acts of the Chapter from 1223 to 1300 are given _in Capitulo Eborum_.  After 1300 _in Capitulo Ecclesiae_, or _in loco Capitulari ipsius  Ecclesiae_. After 1342 _in domo Capitulari_. From this he argues that up  to 1342 the chapter-house was not in existence, or unfinished, but that  it was in use from that date. The geometrical character of the tracery,  and the Purbeck marble shafts used in the chapter-house might seem to  support that view. Professor Willis, however, considers there is little  significance in the difference in the phrases used. _In capitulo_ simply  means \"in chapter,\" and _in loco capitulari_ and _in domo capitulari_  are vague phrases which may either mean a chapter-house, or a place used  for the sittings of the chapter. At any rate, he thinks the  chapter-house was not begun until after 1320, and the passage leading to  it is still later. If this is the case, however, there is no reason why  the chapter-house should not have been finished in 1342, and that would  account for the change of phrase in the Acts. Though, at first sight,  the building appears to be Early Decorated in style, on a closer  examination it will be seen that the slender mouldings, the character of  the carvings, and the details, especially on the outside, all point to a  later date. It is curious, however, that if the building was not begun  until after 1320, the tracery was not curvilinear, as in the great west  windows, and the middle windows of the towers built about the same time.  Perhaps, however, the geometrical forms were found to give the greater  support, necessary owing to the absence of a central pillar. On the  whole, the evidence of details, particularly of the foliage in the  beautiful arcading inside the chapter-house, seem to point to its not  having been begun until 1320 or later.    [Illustration: The West Front (1810).]    In 1362 John of Thoresby became archbishop. The times were unpropitious  for building. Yorkshire was suffering much from the black death, there  was great poverty among the peasantry, and the diocese was in great need  of discipline and reform. Thoresby gave himself up for nine years to  this work, and in 1361 he thought the time had come for the rebuilding  of the choir. We have already seen how at York, one great work led to  another. The transepts were rebuilt that they might be in harmony with  the grandeur of Roger's choir, the nave that it might not be eclipsed by  the transepts; and now it was contended that the choir must not be  inferior to the rest of the church. Therefore, on the 20th of July 1361,  it was resolved by the archbishop and chapter that \"It was right that  every church whatsoever should agree in the fitting decoration of each  particular part, and that the choir in particular, where the holy  sacrifice of the mass took place, should be especially rich in  ornament.\" Thereupon they decided to rebuild the choir. The foundation  stone was laid on the 30th July 1361, and the work was begun at the  extreme east end. There was a very good reason for this procedure. The  design of the new choir, both as to size and the planning of the bays,  was modelled on that of the nave. It was Thoresby's object to build the  largest and most magnificent choir in England. It was therefore both  wider, loftier, and longer than that of Roger's, and beginning at the  east end it was possible to complete almost the whole of the portion  east of the altar as it now stands--that is to say, the presbytery,  without interfering with Roger's choir. While, therefore, the presbytery  was being built, the service of the church was still carried on in  Roger's choir, and only the aisles behind Roger's east end were  destroyed. Even when the four bays of the presbytery were completed, say  about 1370, it was possible to continue the aisles of the new choir  proper without interfering with Roger's work, except to pull down the  towers flanking it, so much wider was the new building than the old.  Even Roger's transepts did not extend beyond the aisle walls of the new  choir, and their place was taken by the present eastern transepts, which  are each merely a bay of the aisle, raised to the same height as the  vault of the choir itself, and open to the choir from top to bottom.    There has been a dispute whether or no this presbytery was completed in  Thoresby's lifetime. According to Stubbs, Thoresby provided tombs for  six of his predecessors, and placed them in the choir in front of the  lady chapel--that is to say, in the presbytery.    He also says that _Idem Archiepiscopus ... Capellam ... Virginis Mariae  Mirabili arte Sculpturae atque notabili pictura peregit_.    The building must certainly have been roofed before it was decorated,  and if Stubbs is accurate, and there is no reason to suppose that he is  not, the work was completed by Thoresby. Thoresby died in 1373, and if  he finished the presbytery, there was a gap of seven or eight years  between its completion and the beginning of the choir. There is internal  evidence to support this presumption. The presbytery, though  Perpendicular in its main features, shows many traces of the transition  from the curvilinear Decorated to the Perpendicular style, especially in  the tracery of the great east window and the clerestory windows. In the  choir proper these traces have vanished, and the work, though apparently  of the same character as that in the presbytery, is altogether  Perpendicular. A lapse of ten years in the continuity of the work would  account for this change, and becomes still more probable when we  consider that the circumstances of the time were not favourable for  great expenditure on building. The presbytery had been completed  unusually quickly. Indeed, we know that L627 were spent upon it in one  year, and this was an unusual amount. The average expenditure, for  instance, on the choir of Ely was L318. It was natural, therefore, that  there should be a halt to collect further funds. The work of the choir  itself proceeded much more slowly. There was a complaint in 1390 on the  archbishop's visitation--_quod fabrica ecclesiae negligenter  tardatur_--and it was not roofed in until 1400.    The contract for the glazing of the great east window is December 10,  1405--that is to say, thirty years and more from the date of its  construction. But there is nothing unusual in this. It was customary  before filling windows with stained glass to cover them with linen cloth  which admitted a sufficient amount of light, or to glaze them with plain  glass; and it was only natural that a long time should elapse before  stained glass could be supplied to the largest window in the world.  Burying was begun at the east end soon after 1400, and Scrope was buried  there in 1405. Bowet's monument also was erected there in 1415, while he  was still alive.    A new high altar was projected in 1418, and the new crypt was fitted  with iron work and paved in the same year. The building of the choir had  caused a subsidence in the crypt, so the work of Roger and others was  broken into fragments and patched together, older capitals being placed  on Roger's pillars, in the condition in which we now see it."]]]
