His hurt had rankled deep and his voice trembled with indignation.    \"But, Joel, I don't go swimming in spring-holes,\" protested Lucy,  divided between amusement and annoyance.    \"I meant it, anyhow,\" said Joel, doggedly.    \"Are you absolutely honest? Is that all you said to provoke Van?\"    \"It's all, Lucy, I swear.\"    She believed him, and saw the unfortunate circumstance more than ever  her fault. \"I'm sorry, Joel. I'm much to blame. I shouldn't have lost  my temper and played that trick with your clothes.... If you'd only had  sense enough to stay out till after dark! But no use crying over spilt  milk. Now, if you'll do your share I'll do mine. I'll tell the boys I  was to blame. I'll persuade them to let you alone. I'll go to Muncie--\"    \"No you won't go cryin' small fer me!\" blurted out Joel.    Lucy was surprised to see pride in him. \"Joel, I'll not make it  appear--\"    \"You'll not say one word about me to any one,\" he went on, with the  blood beginning to darken his face. And now he faced her. How strange  the blaze in his differently colored eyes! \"Lucy Bostil, there's been  thet done an' said to me which I'll never forgive. I'm no good in  Bostil's Ford. Mebbe I never was much. But I could get a job when I  wanted it an' credit when I needed it. Now I can't get nothin'. I'm no  good! ... I'm no good! An' it's your fault!\"    \"Oh, Joel, what can I do?\" cried Lucy.    \"I reckon there's only one way you can square me,\" he replied, suddenly  growing pale. But his eyes were like flint. He certainly looked to be  in possession of all his wits.    \"How?\" queried Lucy, sharply.    \"You can marry me. Thet'll show thet gang! An' it'll square me. Then  I'll go back to work an' I'll stick. Thet's all, Lucy Bostil.\"    Manifestly he was laboring under strong suppressed agitation. That  moment was the last of real strength and dignity ever shown by Joel  Creech.    \"But, Joel, I can't marry you--even if I am to blame for your ruin,\"  said Lucy, simply.    \"Why?\"    \"Because I don't love you.\"    \"I reckon thet won't make any difference, if you don't love some one  else.\"    Lucy gazed blankly at him. He began to shake, and his eyes grew wild.  She rose from the log.    \"Do you love anybody else?\" he asked, passionately.    \"None of your business!\" retorted Lucy. Then, at a strange darkening of  his face, an aspect unfamiliar to her, she grew suddenly frightened.    \"It's Van!\" he said, thickly.    \"Joel, you're a fool!\"    That only infuriated him.    \"So they all say. An' they got my old man believin' it, too. Mebbe I  am.... But I'm a-goin' to kill Van!\"    \"No! No! Joel, what are you saying? I don't love Van. I don't care any  more for him than for any other rider--or--or you.\"    \"Thet's a lie, Lucy Bostil!\"    \"How dare you say I lie?\" demanded Lucy. \"I've a mind to turn my back  on you. I'm trying to make up for my blunder and you--you insult me!\"    \"You talk sweet ... but talk isn't enough. You made me no-good ....  Will you marry me?\"    \"I will not!\" And Lucy, with her blood up, could not keep contempt out  of voice and look, and she did not care. That was the first time she  had ever shown anything, approaching ridicule for Joel. The effect was  remarkable. Like a lash upon a raw wound it made him writhe; but more  significant to Lucy was the sudden convulsive working of his features  and the wildness of his eyes. Then she turned her back, not from  contempt, but to hurry away from him.    He leaped after her and grasped her with rude hands.    \"Let me go!\" cried Lucy, standing perfectly motionless. The hard clutch  of his fingers roused a fierce, hot anger.    Joel did not heed her command. He was forcing her back. He talked  incoherently. One glimpse of his face added terror to Lucy's fury.    \"Joel, you're out of your head!\" she cried, and she began to wrench and  writhe out of his grasp. Then ensued a short, sharp struggle. Joel  could not hold Lucy, but he tore her blouse into shreds. It seemed to  Lucy that he did that savagely. She broke free from him, and he lunged  at her again. With all her strength she lashed his face with the heavy  leather quirt. That staggered him. He almost fell.    Lucy bounded to Sarchedon. In a rush she was up in the saddle. Joel was  running toward her. Blood on his face! Blood on his hands! He was not  the Joel Creech she knew.    \"Stop!\" cried Lucy, fiercely. \"I'll run you down!\"    The big black plunged at a touch of spur and came down quivering, ready  to bolt.    Creech swerved to one side. His face was lividly white except where the  bloody welts crossed it. His jaw seemed to hang loosely, making speech  difficult.    \"Jest fer--thet--\" he panted, hoarsely, \"I'll lay fer you--an' I'll  strip you---an' I'll tie you on a hoss--an' I'll drive you naked  through Bostil's Ford!\"    Lucy saw the utter futility of all her good intentions. Something had  snapped in Joel Creech's mind. And in hers kindness had given  precedence to a fury she did not know was in her. For the second time  she touched a spur to Sarchedon. He leaped out, flashed past Creech,  and thundered up the road. It was all Lucy could do to break his gait  at the first steep rise.        CHAPTER IV    Three wild-horse hunters made camp one night beside a little stream in  the Sevier Valley, five hundred miles, as a crow flies, from Bostil's  Ford.    These hunters had a poor outfit, excepting, of course, their horses.  They were young men, rangy in build, lean and hard from life in the  saddle, bronzed like Indians, still-faced, and keen-eyed. Two of them  appeared to be tired out, and lagged at the camp-fire duties. When the  meager meal was prepared they sat, cross-legged, before a ragged  tarpaulin, eating and drinking in silence.    The sky in the west was rosy, slowly darkening. The valley floor  billowed away, ridged and cut, growing gray and purple and dark. Walls  of stone, pink with the last rays of the setting sun, inclosed the  valley, stretching away toward a long, low, black mountain range.    The place was wild, beautiful, open, with something nameless that made  the desert different from any other country. It was, perhaps, a  loneliness of vast stretches of valley and stone, clear to the eye,  even after sunset. That black mountain range, which looked close enough  to ride to before dark, was a hundred miles distant.    The shades of night fell swiftly, and it was dark by the time the  hunters finished the meal. Then the campfire had burned low. One of the  three dragged branches of dead cedars and replenished the fire. Quickly  it flared up, with the white flame and crackle characteristic of dry  cedar. The night wind had risen, moaning through the gnarled, stunted  cedars near by, and it blew the fragrant wood-smoke into the faces of  the two hunters, who seemed too tired to move.    \"I reckon a pipe would help me make up my mind,\" said one.    \"Wal, Bill,\" replied the other, dryly, \"your mind's made up, else you'd  not say smoke.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because there ain't three pipefuls of thet precious tobacco left.\"    \"Thet's one apiece, then.... Lin, come an' smoke the last pipe with us.\"    The tallest of the three, he who had brought the firewood, stood in the  bright light of the blaze. He looked the born rider, light, lithe,  powerful.    \"Sure, I'll smoke,\" he replied.    Then, presently, he accepted the pipe tendered him, and, sitting down  beside the fire, he composed himself to the enjoyment which his  companions evidently considered worthy of a decision they had reached.    \"So this smokin' means you both want to turn back?\" queried Lin, his  sharp gaze glancing darkly bright in the glow of the fire.    \"Yep, we'll turn back. An', Lordy! the relief I feel!\" replied one.    \"We've been long comin' to it, Lin, an' thet was for your sake,\"  replied the other.    Lin slowly pulled at his pipe and blew out the smoke as if reluctant to  part with it. \"Let's go on,\" he said, quietly.    \"No. I've had all I want of chasin' thet damn wild stallion,\" returned  Bill, shortly.    The other spread wide his hands and bent an expostulating look upon the  one called Lin. \"We're two hundred miles out,\" he said. \"There's only a  little flour left in the bag. No coffee! Only a little salt! All the  hosses except your big Nagger are played out. We're already in strange  country. An' you know what we've heerd of this an' all to the south.  It's all canyons, an' somewheres down there is thet awful canyon none  of our people ever seen. But we've heerd of it. An awful cut-up  country.\"    He finished with a conviction that no one could say a word against the  common sense of his argument. Lin was silent, as if impressed.    Bill raised a strong, lean, brown hand in a forcible gesture. \"We can't  ketch Wildfire!\"    That seemed to him, evidently, a more convincing argument than his  comrade's.    \"Bill is sure right, if I'm wrong, which I ain't,\" went on the other.  \"Lin, we've trailed thet wild stallion for six weeks. Thet's the  longest chase he ever had. He's left his old range. He's cut out his  band, an' left them, one by one. We've tried every trick we know on  him. An' he's too smart for us. There's a hoss! Why, Lin, we're all but  gone to the dogs chasin' Wildfire. An' now I'm done, an' I'm glad of  it.\"    There was another short silence, which presently Bill opened his lips  to break.    \"Lin, it makes me sick to quit. I ain't denyin' thet for a long time  I've had hopes of ketchin' Wildfire. He's the grandest hoss I ever laid  eyes on. I reckon no man, onless he was an Arab, ever seen as good a  one. But now, thet's neither here nor there.... We've got to hit the  back trail.\"    \"Boys, I reckon I'll stick to Wildfire's tracks,\" said Lin, in the same  quiet tone.    Bill swore at him, and the other hunter grew excited and concerned.    \"Lin Slone, are you gone plumb crazy over thet red hoss?\"    \"I--reckon,\" replied Slone. The working of his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#8)"],[1," and the      early Musalmans did not possess books which would serve for such      teaching. A change soon, however, took place. In the year in which the      great jurisconsult of Syria died (A.H. 80) N'iman bin Sabit, surnamed      Abu Hanifa was born. He is the most celebrated of the founders of the      schools of jurisprudence, a science which ranks first in all Muslim      seats of learning. Until that time and for thirty years later the      Mufassirs,[36] the Muhaddis,[37] and the Fuqiha,[38] had all their      knowledge by heart, and those who possessed good memories were highly      esteemed. Many of them knew by heart the whole Quran with the comments      made on it by the Prophet and by the Companions; they also knew the      Traditions and their explanations, and all the commands (Ahkam) which      proceed from the Quran, and the Sunnat. Such men enjoyed the right of      Mujtahidin. They transmitted their knowledge to their scholars orally.      It was not till towards the middle of the second century A.H. that      treatises on the different branches of the Law were written, after      which six schools (Mazhabs) of jurisprudence were formed. The founders,      all Imams of the first class, were Abu Hanifa, the Imam-i-A'zam or      great Imam (A.H. 150),[39] Safian As-Sauri (A.H. 161), Malik (A.H.      179), As-Shafa'i (A.H. 204), Hanbal (A.H. 241) and Imam Daud Az-Zahari      (A.H. 270). The two sects founded by Sauri and Zahari became extinct in      the eighth century of the Hijra. The other four still remain. These men      venerated one another. The younger ones speak with great respect of the      elder. Thus Shafa'i said:--\"No one in the world was so well versed in      jurisprudence as Abu Hanifa was, and he who has read neither his works,      nor those of his disciples knows nothing of jurisprudence.\" Hanbal when      sick wore a shirt which had belonged to Shafa'i, in order that he might      be cured of his malady; but all this {34} did not prevent them starting      schools of their own, for the right of Ijtihad is granted to those who      are real Mujtahidin. There are three degrees of Ijtihad.        1. Al-Ijtihad fi'l Shari': absolute independence in legislation        2. Al-Ijtihad fi'l Mazhab: authority in the judicial systems founded by      the Mujtahidin of the first class.        3. Al-Ijtihad fi'l Masail: authority in cases which have not been      decided by the authors of the four systems of jurisprudence.        The first is called a complete and absolute authority, the second      relative, the third special.        THE FIRST DEGREE OF IJTIHAD.        Absolute independence in legislation is the gift of God. He to whom it      is given when seeking to discover the meaning of the Divine Law is not      bound to follow any other teacher. He can use his own judgment. This      gift was bestowed on the jurisconsults of the first, and to some in the      second and third centuries. The Companions, however, who were closely      connected with the Prophet, having transmitted immediately to their      posterity the treasures of legislation, are looked upon as Mujtahidin      of much higher authority than those of the second and third centuries.      Thus Abu Hanifa says:--\"That which comes to us from the Companions is      on our head and eyes (_i.e._, to be received with respect): as to that      which comes from the Tabi'in, they are men and we are men.\"        Since the time of the Tabi'in this degree of Ijtihad has only been      conferred on the six great Imams. Theoretically any Muslim can attain      to this degree, but it is one of the principles of jurisprudence that      the confirmation of this rank is dependent on many conditions, and so      no one now gains the honour. These conditions are:--        1. The knowledge of the Quran and all that is related to it; that is to      say, a complete knowledge of Arabic literature, a profound acquaintance      with the orders of the Quran and all their sub-divisions, their      relationship to each other and their connection with the orders of the      Sunnat. The candidate should know when, and why each verse of the Quran      was written, he should have a perfect acquaintance with the literal      meaning of the words, the speciality or generality of each clause, the      abrogating and abrogated sentences. He should be able to make clear the      meaning of the 'obscure' passages (Mutashabih), to discriminate between      the literal and the allegorical, the universal and the particular.        2. He must know the Quran by heart with all the Traditions and      explanations. {35}        3. He must have a perfect knowledge of the Traditions, or at least of      three thousand of them.        He must know their source, history, object and their connection with      the laws of the Quran. He should know by heart the most important      Traditions.        4. A pious and austere life.        5. A profound knowledge of all the sciences of the Law.        Should any one _now_ aspire to such a degree another condition would be      added, _viz_:--        6. A complete knowledge of the four schools of jurisprudence.        The obstacles, then, are almost insurmountable. On the one hand, there      is the severity of the 'Ulama, which requires from the candidate things      almost impossible; on the other, there is the attachment of the 'Ulama      to their own Imams, for should such a man arise no one is bound now to      listen to him. Imam Hanbal said:--\"Draw your knowledge from whence the      Imams drew theirs, and do not content yourself with following others      for that is certainly blindness of sight\". Thus the schools of the four      Imams remain intact after a thousand years have passed, and so the      'Ulama recognise since the time of these Imams no Mujtahid of the first      degree. Ibn Hanbal was the last.        The rights of the man who attained to this degree were very important.      He was not bound to be a disciple of another, he was a mediator between      the Law and his followers, for whom he established a system of      legislation, without any one having the right to make any objection. He      had the right to explain the Quran, the Sunnat and the Ijma' according      as he understood them. He used the Prophet's words, whilst his      disciples only used his. Should a disciple find some discrepancy      between a decision of his own Imam and the Quran or Traditions, he must      abide by the decision of the Imam. The Law does not permit him to      interpret after his own fashion. When once the disciple has entered the      sect of one Imam he cannot leave it and join another. He loses the      right of private judgment, for only a Mujtahid of the first class can      dispute the decision of one of the Imams. Theoretically such Mujtahidin      may still arise; but, as we have already shown, practically they do      not.        THE SECOND DEGREE OF IJTIHAD.        This degree has been granted to the immediate disciples of the great      Imams who have elaborated the systems of their masters. They enjoyed      the special consideration of the contemporary 'Ulama, and of their      respective Imams who in some cases have allowed them {36} to retain      their own opinion.' The most famous of these men are the two disciples      of Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad bin al Hasan. In a secondary      matter their opinion carries great weight. It is laid down as a rule      that a Mufti may follow the unanimous opinion of these two even when it      goes against that of Abu Hanifa.        THE THIRD DEGREE OF IJTIHAD.        This is the degree of special independence. The candidates for it      should have a perfect knowledge of all the branches of jurisprudence      according to the four schools of the Arabic language and literature.      They can solve cases which come before them, giving reasons for their      judgment, or decide on cases which have not been settled by previous      Mujtahidin; but in either case their decisions must always be in      absolute accordance with the opinions of the Mujtahidin of the first      and second classes, and with the principles which guided them. Many of      these men attained great celebrity during their lifetime, but to most      of them this rank is not accorded till after their death. Since Imam      Qazi Khan died (A.H. 592), no one has been recognised by the Sunnis as      a Mujtahid even of the third class.        There are three other inferior classes of jurists, called Muqallidin,      or followers of the Mujtahidin; but all that the highest in rank      amongst them can do is to explain obscure passages in the writings of      the older jurisconsults. By some of the 'Ulama they are considered to      be equal to the Mujtahidin of the third class. If there are several      conflicting legal opinions on any point, they can select one opinion on      which to base their decision. This a mere Qazi cannot do. In such a      case he would have to refer to those men, or to their writings for      guidance. They seem to have written commentaries on the legal systems      without originating anything new. The author of the Hidayah, who lived      at the end of the sixth century, was a Muqallid.        Such is Mirza Kazim Beg's account. The whole article, of which I have      only given the main points, is worthy of the closest study. It shows      how \"the system, as a whole, rejects experience as a guide to deeper      insight or wider knowledge; tramples upon the teaching of the past;      pays no heed to differences of climate, character, or history; but      regards itself as a body of absolute truth, one jot or tittle of which      cannot be rejected without incurring the everlasting wrath of God.\"[40]    {37}           *       *       *       *       *      CHAPTER II.
