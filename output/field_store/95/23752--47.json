Instead of which, we ran the longest way round the house.  Why? Was it to give Mark more time in which to escape? Only, in that  case--why run? Also, how did Cayley know then that it was Mark who  was trying to escape? If he had guessed--well, not guessed, but been  afraid--that one had shot the other, it was much more likely that Robert  had shot Mark. Indeed, he had admitted that this was what he thought.  The first thing he had said when he turned the body over was, 'Thank  God! I was afraid it was Mark.' But why should he want to give Robert  time in which to get away? And again--why run, if he did want to give  him time?\"    Antony went out of the house again to the lawns at the back, and sat  down on a bench in view of the office windows.    \"Now then,\" he said, \"let's go through Cayley's mind carefully, and see  what we get.\"    Cayley had been in the hall when Robert was shown into the office. The  servant goes off to look for Mark, and Cayley goes on with his book.  Mark comes down the stairs, warns Cayley to stand by in case he is  wanted, and goes to meet his brother. What does Cayley expect? Possibly  that he won't be wanted at all; possibly that his advice may be wanted  in the matter, say, of paying Robert's debts, or getting him a passage  back to Australia; possibly that his physical assistance may be wanted  to get an obstreperous Robert out of the house. Well, he sits there for  a moment, and then goes into the library. Why not? He is still within  reach, if wanted. Suddenly he hears a pistol-shot. A pistol-shot is the  last noise you expect to hear in a country-house; very natural, then,  that for the moment he would hardly realize what it was. He listens--and  hears nothing more. Perhaps it wasn't a pistol-shot after all. After a  moment or two he goes to the library door again. The profound silence  makes him uneasy now. Was it a pistol-shot? Absurd! Still--no harm in  going into the office on some excuse, just to reassure himself. So he  tries the door--and finds it locked!    What are his emotions now? Alarm, uncertainty. Something is happening.  Incredible though it seems, it must have been a pistol-shot. He is  banging at the door and calling out to Mark, and there is no answer.  Alarm--yes. But alarm for whose safety? Mark's, obviously. Robert is a  stranger; Mark is an intimate friend. Robert has written a letter that  morning, the letter of a man in a dangerous temper. Robert is the tough  customer; Mark the highly civilized gentleman. If there has been a  quarrel, it is Robert who has shot Mark. He bangs at the door again.    Of course, to Antony, coming suddenly upon this scene, Cayley's conduct  had seemed rather absurd, but then, just for the moment, Cayley had lost  his head. Anybody else might have done the same. But, as soon as Antony  suggested trying the windows, Cayley saw that that was the obvious thing  to do. So he leads the way to the windows--the longest way.    Why? To give the murderer time to escape? If he had thought then that  Mark was the murderer, perhaps, yes. But he thinks that Robert is the  murderer. If he is not hiding anything, he must think so. Indeed he says  so, when he sees the body; \"I was afraid it was Mark,\" he says, when he  finds that it is Robert who is killed. No reason, then, for wishing to  gain time. On the contrary, every instinct would urge him to get into  the room as quickly as possible, and seize the wicked Robert. Yet he  goes the longest way round. Why? And then, why run?    \"That's the question,\" said Antony to himself, as he filled his pipe,  \"and bless me if I know the answer. It may be, of course, that Cayley is  just a coward. He was in no hurry to get close to Robert's revolver, and  yet wanted me to think that he was bursting with eagerness. That would  explain it, but then that makes Cayley out a coward. Is he? At any rate  he pushed his face up against the window bravely enough. No, I want a  better answer than that.\"    He sat there with his unlit pipe in his hand, thinking. There were one  or two other things in the back of his brain, waiting to be taken out  and looked at. For the moment he left them undisturbed. They would come  back to him later when he wanted them.    He laughed suddenly, and lit his pipe.    \"I was wanting a new profession,\" he thought, \"and now I've found it.  Antony Gillingham, our own private sleuthhound. I shall begin to-day.\"    Whatever Antony Gillingham's other qualifications for his new  profession, he had at any rate a brain which worked clearly and quickly.  And this clear brain of his had already told him that he was the only  person in the house at that moment who was unhandicapped in the search  for truth. The inspector had arrived in it to find a man dead and a man  missing. It was extremely probable, no doubt, that the missing man  had shot the dead man. But it was more than extremely probable, it was  almost certain that the Inspector would start with the idea that this  extremely probable solution was the one true solution, and that, in  consequence, he would be less disposed to consider without prejudice any  other solution. As regards all the rest of them--Cayley, the guests,  the servants--they also were prejudiced; in favour of Mark (or possibly,  for all he knew, against Mark); in favour of, or against, each other;  they had formed some previous opinion, from what had been said that  morning, of the sort of man Robert was. No one of them could consider  the matter with an unbiased mind.    But Antony could. He knew nothing about Mark; he knew nothing about  Robert. He had seen the dead man before he was told who the dead man  was. He knew that a tragedy had happened before he knew that anybody was  missing. Those first impressions, which are so vitally important, had  been received solely on the merits of the case; they were founded on the  evidence of his senses, not on the evidence of his emotions or of other  people's senses. He was in a much better position for getting at the  truth than was the Inspector.    It is possible that, in thinking this, Antony was doing Inspector Birch  a slight injustice. Birch was certainly prepared to believe that Mark  had shot his brother. Robert had been shown into the office (witness  Audrey); Mark had gone in to Robert (witness Cayley); Mark and Robert  had been heard talking (witness Elsie); there was a shot (witness  everybody); the room had been entered and Robert's body had been found  (witness Cayley and Gillingham). And Mark was missing. Obviously,  then, Mark had killed his brother: accidentally, as Cayley believed, or  deliberately, as Elsie's evidence seemed to suggest. There was no point  in looking for a difficult solution to a problem, when the easy solution  had no flaw in it. But at the same time Birch would have preferred the  difficult solution, simply because there was more credit attached to  it. A \"sensational\" arrest of somebody in the house would have given him  more pleasure than a commonplace pursuit of Mark Ablett across  country. Mark must be found, guilty or not guilty. But there were other  possibilities. It would have interested Antony to know that, just at the  time when he was feeling rather superior to the prejudiced inspector,  the Inspector himself was letting his mind dwell lovingly upon  the possibilities in connection with Mr. Gillingham. Was it only a  coincidence that Mr. Gillingham had turned up just when he did? And Mr.  Beverley's curious answers when asked for some account of his friend.  An assistant in a tobacconist's, a waiter! An odd man, Mr. Gillingham,  evidently. It might be as well to keep an eye on him.          CHAPTER VI. Outside Or Inside?      The guests had said good-bye to Cayley, according to their different  manner. The Major, gruff and simple: \"If you want me, command me.  Anything I can do--Good-bye\"; Betty, silently sympathetic, with  everything in her large eyes which she was too much overawed to tell;  Mrs. Calladine, protesting that she did not know what to say, but  apparently finding plenty; and Miss Norris, crowding so much into one  despairing gesture that Cayley's unvarying \"Thank you very much\" might  have been taken this time as gratitude for an artistic entertainment.    Bill had seen them into the car, had taken his own farewells (with a  special squeeze of the hand for Betty), and had wandered out to join  Antony on his garden seat.    \"Well, this is a rum show,\" said Bill as he sat down.    \"Very rum, William.\"    \"And you actually walked right into it?\"    \"Right into it,\" said Antony.    \"Then you're the man I want. There are all sorts of rumours and  mysteries about, and that inspector fellow simply wouldn't keep to the  point when I wanted to ask him about the murder, or whatever it is, but  kept asking me questions about where I'd met you first, and all sorts of  dull things like that. Now, what really happened?\"    Antony told him as concisely as he could all that he had already told  the Inspector, Bill interrupting him here and there with appropriate  \"Good Lords\" and whistles.    \"I say, it's a bit of a business, isn't it? Where do I come in,  exactly?\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"Well, everybody else is bundled off except me, and I get put through it  by that inspector as if I knew all about it--what's the idea?\"    Antony smiled at him.    \"Well, there's nothing to worry about, you know. Naturally Birch wanted  to see one of you so as to know what you'd all been doing all day. And  Cayley was nice enough to think that you'd be company for me, as I knew  you already. And well, that's all.\"    \"You're staying here, in the house?\" said Bill eagerly. \"Good man.  That's splendid.\"    \"It reconciles you to the departure of some of the others?\"    Bill blushed.    \"Oh, well, I shall see her again next week, anyway,\" he murmured.    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#8)"],[1,"finished, she turned to her brother and asked with a smile:    \"And what shall I sing, Sir Richard?\"    \"The one I love best--'Fairy Bells.'\"    When the first line with its sweet accompaniment floated out from the  porch on the balmy air of the June evening, the Lieutenant's fears had  vanished. Never had he heard a song whose trembling melody so found his  inmost soul. It set the Fairy Bells ringing in the deep woods of his  far-away Mississippi home. He could see the fairy ringing them--her  beautiful hair streaming in the moonlight, a smile on her lips, the joy  and beauty of eternal youth in every movement of her exquisite form.    When the last note had died softly away, he leaned close and before he  knew what he was doing, whispered:    \"Glorious, Miss Sarah!\"    \"You like it very much?\" she asked.    \"It's divine.\"    \"My favorite, too.\"    All night the \"Fairy Bells\" rang in his heart. For the first time in  life, he failed to sleep. He listened entranced until dawn.          VIII    LOVE      In the swift weeks which followed, life blossomed with new and wonderful  meaning.    In the stern years on the plains, the young officer had known but one  motive of action--duty. He was an exile from home and its comforts,  friends and the haunts of civilized man for his country's sake. He had  come to plant her flag on the farthest frontier and push it farther  against all corners.    In the struggle against the snows of winter and the pestilence of the  summer wilderness, he had fought Nature with the dogged determination of  the soldier. Snow meant winter quarters, the spring marching and  fighting. The hills were breastworks. The night brought dreams of  strategy and surprise. The grass and flowers were symbols of a nation's  wealth and the prophecy of war.    By a strange magic, the coming of a girl had transformed the world. He  had seen the strategic value of these hills and valleys often before. He  had not dreamed of their beauty. The mists that hung over the ragged  lines of the western horizon were no longer fogs that might conceal an  army. They were the folds of a huge veil which Nature was softly drawing  over the face of a beautiful bride. Why had he not seen this before?    The awful silence of the plains from which he had fled to books had  suddenly become God's great whispering gallery. He listened with joyous  awe and reverence.    The stars had been his guides by night to find the trail. He had merely  lifted his eyes to make the reckoning. He had never seen before the  crystal flash from their jeweled depths.    He looked into the eyes of the graceful young rider by his side and  longed to tell her of this miracle wrought in his soul. But he  hesitated. She was too dignified and self-possessed. It would be silly  when put into words.    But the world to-day was too beautiful to hurry through it. He just  couldn't.    \"Let's stop on this hill and watch the sunset, Miss Sarah?\" he  suggested.    \"I'd love to,\" was the simple answer.    With a light laugh, she sprang from the saddle. They touched the ground  at the same moment.    He looked at her with undisguised admiration.    \"You're a wonderful rider,\" he said.    \"A soldier's daughter must be--it's part of her life.\"    He tied their horses to the low hanging limbs of a cluster of scrub  trees, and found a seat on the bowlders which the Indians had set for a  landmark on the lonely hilltop.    Westward the plains stretched, a silent ocean of green, luscious grass.    \"What's that dark spot in the valley?\" the girl eagerly asked.    \"Watch it a moment--\"    They sat in silence for five minutes.    \"Why, it's moving!\" she cried.    \"Yes.\"    \"How curious--\"    \"An illusion?\" he suggested.    \"Nonsense, I'm not dreaming.\"    \"I've been dreaming a lot lately--\"    A smile played about the corners of her fine mouth. But she ignored the  hint.    \"Tell me,\" she cried; \"you studied the sciences at West Point, what does  it mean?\"    \"Look closely. Any fifteen-year-old boy of the plains could explain it.\"    \"Am I so ignorant?\" she laughed.    \"No,\" he answered soberly, \"our eyes just refuse to see things at which  we are looking until the voice within reveals. The eyes of a hunter  could make no mistake about such a spot--particularly if it moved.\"    \"It might be a passing cloud--\"    \"There's none in the sky.\"    \"Tell me!\" she pleaded.    \"A herd of buffalo.\"    \"That big black field! It must be ten acres--\"    The man laughed at her ignorance with a sudden longing in his heart to  help and protect her.    \"Ten acres! Look again. They are twenty miles away. The herd is packed  so densely, the ground is invisible. They cover a thousand acres.\"    \"Impossible--\"    \"I assure you, it's true. They were once even more plentiful. But we're  pushing them back with the Indians into the sunset. And they, too, will  fade away into the twilight at last--\"    He stopped suddenly. He had almost spoken a sentence that would have  committed him beyond retreat. It was just on his lips to say:    \"I didn't take such tender views of Indians and buffaloes until I met  you!\"    For the life of him he couldn't make the girl out. Her voice was music.  Her laughter contagious. And yet she was reserved. About her personality  hung a spell which forbade familiarity. Flirting was a pastime in the  army. But it had never appealed to him. He was not so sure about her  when she laughed.    And then her father worried him. The fiery old Southerner had the temper  of the devil when roused. He could see that this second daughter was his  favorite. He had caught a look of unreasonable anger and jealousy in his  eye only that afternoon when they rode away together.    Still he must risk it. He had really suggested this sunset scene for  that purpose. The field was his own choosing. Only a coward could run  now.    He managed at last to get his lips to work.    \"Since you came, Miss Sarah--I've been seeing life at a new angle--\" he  paused awkwardly.    The red blood mounted to her cheeks.    \"You have given me new eyes--\"    [Illustration: \"'You have given me new eyes'\"]    She turned her head away. There was no mistaking the tremor of his  tones. She was too honest to simper and pretend. Her heart was pounding  so loudly she wondered if he could hear.    He fumbled nervously with his glove, glanced at her from the corner of  his eye, and his voice sank to a whisper:    \"I--I love you, Sarah!\"    She turned slowly and looked at him through dimmed eyes:    \"And I love you--\"    She paused, brushed a tear from her cheek, and with sweet reproach  quietly added:    \"Why didn't you tell me sooner? We've lost so many beautiful days that  might have been perfect--\"    He suddenly stooped and kissed her full lips.    \"We'll not lose any more--\"    \"The world _is_ beautiful, isn't it, dear!\" she said, nestling closer.    \"Since I see with your eyes--yes. It was only a place to fight in,  before. Now it's a fairy world, and these wild flowers that cover the  plains only grow to make a carpet for the feet of the girl I love--\"    \"A fairy world--yes--\" she whispered, \"it's been just that to me since I  first sang the 'Fairy Bells' for you--\"    \"I'll never love another song as that,\" he said reverently.    \"Nor I,\" was the low response. \"My heart will beat to its music  forever--it just means you, now--\"    For a long time they sat without words, holding each other's hand. The  sun hung a glowing ball of fire on the rim of the far-away hills, and  the shadows of the valley deepened into twilight.    \"How wonderful the silence of the plains!\" the lover sighed.    \"It used to oppress me.\"    The man nodded.    \"And now, I hear the beat of angels' wings and know that God is near--\"    \"Because we love--\" and she laughed for joy.    Again they sat in sweet, brooding silence.    A horseman rode over the hilltop in the glow of the fading sun. From its  summit, he lifted his hand and waved a salute. They looked below, and in  the doorway of a cabin, a young mother stood, a babe in her arms  answering with hand uplifted high above her child.    \"What does it matter, dear,\" she whispered, \"a cabin or a palace!\"          IX    WAR      Side by side through the still white light of the full moon they rode  home, in each heart the glow of the wonder and joy of Love's first  revelation. Words were an intrusion. The eyes of the soul were seeing  now the hidden things of life.    The gleam of the lights at the Fort brought them sharply out of  dreamland into the world of fact.    \"You must see my father to-night, dear,\" she said eagerly.    \"Must I, to-night?\"    \"It's best.\"    \"I'd rather face a hundred Red Men in war paint.\"    A merry laugh was her answer as she leaned close:    \"Don't be silly, he likes you.\"    \"But he _loves_ you.\"    \"Of course, and for that reason my happiness will be his.\"    \"God knows, I hope so,\" was the doleful response. \"But if I must, I  must. I'll see him.\"    A quick kiss in the friendly shadows and she was gone.    He walked alone an hour after supper, screwing up his courage to the  point of bearding the Colonel in his den. He fumbled the door-bell at  last, his heart in his throat.    Old Rough and Ready was not inclined to help him in his embarrassment.  Never had he seen the lines of his strong jaw harder or more set than  when he grunted:    \"Sit down, sir. Don't stand there staring. I'm not on inspection.\"    The perspiration started on his forehead and he moistened his dry lips.    \"I beg your pardon, Colonel. I was a little flustered.  I've--a--something--on--my mind--\"    \"Out with it!\"    \"I--I--I'm in love with Miss Sarah.\"    \"You don't say?\"    \"Y-yes, sir.\"    \"Well, it's no news to me. The whole family have been enjoying the  affair for some time. I suppose you're asking--or think you're  asking--for my daughter's hand in marriage?\"    \"That's it--yes, sir--exactly.\"    \"I guessed as much. I'm glad to tell you, young man, that I've always  had "]]]
