He shook his  head when he heard of the unregistered bonds.    \"I am afraid you will never see them again, Randolph,\" he said to his  brother.    \"I am afraid so myself,\" was the mournful reply.    Anderson Rover had come home to see his boys off to school.    \"I want you to make the most of your opportunities while at Putnam Hall  this term,\" he said, \"for it is to be your last.\"    \"Yes, I know that,\" answered Tom. \"But after that, what?\"    \"We will talk that over later, Tom. You must either go to college or get  ready to go into business.\"    \"I'd like to go to college!\" put in Dick.    \"So would I--if I knew what kind of a place it was,\" added Tom.    \"If it was as fine a place as Putnam Hall I'd jump at it,\" came from  Sam.    The next few days flew by quickly. During that time Dick received a  letter from Dan Baxter, the former bully of Putnam Hall, which  interested him not a little. This letter ran, in part, as follows:    \"I am glad to say that I am now doing fairly well. I tried several  positions and am now a traveling salesman for a large carpet house. I  get fifteen dollars per week, all my expenses, and a commission on  sales, so I consider myself lucky.    \"When I look back on what I once was, Dick, I can scarcely realize what  a change has come. But I feel happier than I ever was, and I am in hopes  that I shall live to make a man of myself yet. I am trying to give up  all my bad habits, and I haven't smoked, or drank a glass of liquor,  since I left you in the south.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"That's the kind of a letter I like to get,\" said Dick, as he let his  brothers peruse the communication. \"It does a fellow's heart good,  doesn't it?\"    \"I am glad we let him have that hundred dollars,\" said Sam. \"Do you  think he'll pay it back?\"    \"Here is a postscript in which he says he will send a money order next  week.\"    \"He certainly means to pull himself together,\" said Tom. \"Well, now he  has turned over a new leaf, I wish him the best of luck.\"    Almost before they knew it, it was time to leave the farm and journey to  Putnam Hall. Everybody was sorry to see them go.    \"I can't abide yo' boys being away nohow!\" wailed Aleck Pop. \"It jess  don't seem natural to have yo' gone, dat's wot it don't!\"    \"Oh, we'll be back some day, Aleck,\" answered Dick. \"And if we go off on  some trip later, maybe we'll take you along.\"    \"I most wish I was a waiter ag'in at de Hall,\" sighed the colored man.    \"They can't spare you from here,\" said Sam.    \"Oh, I know dat, Sam.\"    The boys' trunks had been packed and sent on ahead, so all they carried  with them were their dress-suit cases. Their father drove them to the  railroad station at Oak Run, and their aunt and uncle and the others  around the farm came out on the piazza to see them off.    \"Now be good boys,\" admonished their Aunt Martha. \"And take care and  don't get sick.\"    \"And be sure and study all you can,\" said their Uncle Randolph.  \"Remember nothing is quite so grand as learning in this world.\"    \"Yo' keep out ob mischief!\" cried Aleck Pop, shaking a warning finger at  Tom, who grinned broadly.    And then the carriage started off, and the journey to Putnam Hall was  begun.          CHAPTER IX    AT THE WILD WEST SHOW      As my old readers know, Putnam Hall was located not far from the village  of Cedarville on Cayuga Lake. To get to the school the boys had to take  a train to Ithaca and then board a little lake steamer stopping at  Cedarville and various other points along the shore.    \"It seems a long time since we were at the Hall,\" observed Dick, as they  settled down in the train.    \"And what a lot of things have happened since then!\" exclaimed Sam. \"I  can tell you what, we'll have a story to tell to the others, won't we?\"    \"I guess Songbird, Fred, and Hans Mueller have already told everything,\"  returned Tom. \"More than likely Songbird has concocted some verses about  it.\"    The run to Ithaca took several hours, and they lunched at noon in the  dining car. It was a beautiful day, and the boys enjoyed the scenery as  much as if they had never seen it before.    \"I hope we can make a good connection for Cedarville,\" said Sam as they  left the train and started for the dock from which the _Golden Star_  made her trips on the lake. But they were doomed to disappointment, the  steamboat had had a break-down and would be delayed two hours or more.    As there was nothing to do but to wait, the boys checked their  dress-suit cases and then started for a stroll through the city. They  soon learned that a wild west show was giving an exhibition there and  consequently the place was crowded with folks from the surrounding  districts.    \"I shouldn't mind going to the wild west show,\" observed Tom. \"Do you  think we have time?\"    \"We could spend an hour there anyway,\" answered Sam.    \"It depends on where the show is to be held,\" came from Dick.    They soon ascertained that the show grounds were not far off, and made  their way thither. The exhibition had already started, and they got  inside the big tent-like enclosure as speedily as possible.    The show was a fairly good one, and the boys thoroughly enjoyed the  trick riding by cowboys, and the fancy rifle shooting. Then came some  wild riding by real Indians.    \"Almost makes a fellow feel as if he'd like to be on a horse himself,\"  said Tom. He liked horseback riding very well.    \"Say, I want you to look over there,\" said Sam, pointing to the seats  some distance away. \"Do you see that man sitting near the bottom--right  beside that boy with the basket of peanuts?\"    Tom and Dick looked in the direction pointed out, and the eldest Rover  gave a start.    \"Sam, do you think it is the fellow called Merrick?\" he exclaimed.    \"Doesn't he look like it?\"    \"He certainly does--now you speak of it,\" came from Tom. \"And, by the  way, don't you remember about that envelope picked up in the log cabin?  It was postmarked Ithaca.\"    \"So it was! Perhaps this Merrick lives here.\"    \"Let us go over and get a closer look at him,\" said Dick, and left his  seat, followed by the others.    There was a large crowd, so they had some difficulty in making their way  to where the man was located. In his haste, Dick bumped against a waiter  selling lemonade and spilled the contents of two glasses on the ground.    \"Excuse me,\" he said.    \"Hi! you've got to pay for the lemonade,\" roared the waiter, angrily.  \"You pay up, you clumsy clown!\"    \"See here, my man, I'll pay you, but I want you to understand you can't  call me a clown,\" said Dick, angrily.    \"Ah! go on wid yer! Pay up, see?\"    \"Here's your money,\" and Dick held out ten cents. \"Now, am I a clown or  not?\"    \"Well, er----\"    \"Am I or not?\" And the eldest Rover boy doubled up his fists. He knew he  must \"take the bull by the horns\" with such an individual as that before  him.    \"Excuse me,\" mumbled the fellow and moved away. \"I--er--suppose yer  couldn't help it.\"    Sam and Tom had gone ahead and they were now close to the man they took  to be Merrick.    \"No mistake here!\" declared Sam, as he got a good, square look at the  fellow's face.    \"He sees us!\" exclaimed Tom, a second later. \"He is trying to get away.\"    The boy was right, Merrick had seen them. He was greatly amazed, for he  had not dreamed of their being in that vicinity. He left his seat in a  hurry, and, elbowing his way through the crowd, started for the entrance  to the big tent-like enclosure.    By this time Dick was coming up and Sam and Tom quickly acquainted him  with what was going on. All three of the Rovers pushed through the big  crowd after Merrick, but, before they could draw near, the rascal was  outside and running between a number of carriages and wagons standing in  that vicinity.    \"Come on after him!\" cried Tom. \"We must capture him if we can!\"    They set off on a smart run, but Merrick could run also, and fear now  lent speed to his flying feet. On and on went the swindler, with the  Rover boys less than a square behind him. Then, as they came to a number  of tall buildings, Merrick darted around a corner and out of sight.    When the Rover boys reached the corner they looked in every direction  for the man. Only a few people were about, the majority of the town  folks being at the show.    \"Wonder if he went straight on, or took to some side street?\" mused  Dick.    \"I'll go straight on,\" said Sam. \"Dick, you can take one side street and  Tom can take the other,\" and away went the youngest Rover, at a fresh  burst of speed.    Sam's advice was considered good, and soon all of the boys had  scattered. The street Tom followed was lined with tall tenements and  ended in little more than an alleyway.    Coming to another corner, Tom paused and gazed in all directions. As he  turned his head he saw a man look out from a tenement doorway. Then the  head was drawn back quickly.    \"Merrick!\" muttered Tom to himself, and turned back to the tenement,  which was a building four stories high. On one side was something of an  alleyway and beyond were other tenements, and the rear of a big building  used for a factory and offices.    Tom found the front door of the tenement wide open and he did not  hesitate to go in. Nobody was in sight, but he heard hasty footsteps on  the floor above.    \"Merrick! you might as well give up!\" he called out. \"Come down here!\"    \"Go on about your business, young fellow!\" came the reply. \"If you try  to follow me you'll get the worst of it.\"    Undaunted by this threat, Tom mounted the stairs two steps at a time. As  he did so he heard Merrick go up a second flight and then a third.    \"Must think he can hide on the roof,\" thought Tom. \"Well, I'll corner  him if I can.\"    As Tom ran through the hallway on the third floor a door opened and an  old woman confronted him.    \"What do yez want here?\" she demanded, in strong Irish accents.    \"I am after a thief,\" answered Tom.    \"A"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22168"],[0,"The Golden Spears (#8)"],[1,"reached the bank  below the fairy palace.    Well, between hunting in the forest, and sailing over the lake, and  dancing in the greenwood glade and in the banquet hall, the days passed,  but all the time the prince was thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and one  moonlit night, when he was lying awake on his couch thinking of her, a  shadow was suddenly cast on the floor.    The prince looked towards the window, and what should he see sitting  on the sill outside but a little woman tapping the pane with a golden  bodkin.    The prince jumped from his couch and opened the window, and the little  woman floated on the moonbeams into the room and sat down on the floor.    \"You are thinking of the Princess Ailinn,\" said the little woman.    \"I never think of anyone else,\" said the prince.    \"I know that,\" said the little woman, \"and it's because of your love for  each other, and because her mother was a friend to me in the days gone  by, that I have come here to try and help you; but there is not much  time for talking, the night advances. At the bank below a boat awaits  you. Step into it and it will lead you to the mainland, and when you  reach it you will find before you a path that will take you to the green  fields of Erin and the plains of Tara. I know you will have to face  danger. I know not what kind of danger; but whatever it may be do not  draw your sword before you tread upon the mainland, for if you do you  shall never reach it, and the boat will come back again to the floating  island; and now go and may luck go with you;\" and saying this the little  woman climbed up the moonbeams and disappeared.    The prince left the palace and descended to the lake, and there before  him he saw a glistening boat; he stepped into it, and the boat went on  and on beneath the moon, and at last he saw the mainland, and he could  trace a winding pathway going away from the shore. The sight filled his  heart with joy, but suddenly the milk-white moonshine died away, and  looking up to the sky he saw the moon turning fiery red, and the waters  of the lake, shining like silver a moment before, took a blood-red hue,  and a wind arose that stirred the waters, and they leaped up against the  little boat, tossing it from side to side. While Cuglas was wondering  at the change, he heard a strange, unearthly noise ahead of him, and  a bristling monster, lifting its claws above the water, in a moment  was beside the boat and stuck one of his claws in the left arm of the  prince, and pierced the flesh to the bone. Maddened by the pain the  prince drew his sword and chopped off the monster's claw. The monster  disappeared beneath the lake, and, as it did so, the color of the water  changed, and the silver moonlight shone down from the sky again, but the  boat no longer went on towards the mainland, but sped back towards the  floating island, while forth from the island came a fleet of fairy boats  to meet it, led by the shallop of the fairy queen. The queen greeted the  prince as if she knew not of his attempted flight, and to the music of  the harps the fleet returned to the palace.    The next day passed and the night came, and again the prince was lying  on the couch, thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and again he saw the  shadow on the floor and heard the tapping against the window.    And when he opened it the little woman slid into the room.    \"You failed last night,\" she said, \"but I come to give you another  chance. To-morrow the queen must set out on a visit to her fairy  kinsmen, who dwell in the green hill near the plain of Tara; she cannot  take you with her, for if your feet once touched the green grass that  grows in the fruitful fields of Erin, she could never bring you back  again. And so, when you find she has left the palace, go at once into  the banquet hall and look behind the throne, and you will see a small  door let down into the ground. Pull this up and descend the steps which  you will see. Where they lead to I cannot tell. What dangers may be  before you I do not know; but this I know, if you accept anything, no  matter what it is, from anyone you may meet on your way, you shall not  set foot on the soil of Erin.\"    And having said this the little woman, rising from the floor, floated  out through the window.    The prince returned to his couch, and the next morning, as soon as he  heard the queen had left the palace, he hastened to the banquet hall.  He discovered the door and descended the steps, and he found himself  in a gloomy and lonesome valley. Jagged mountains, black as night, rose  on either side, and huge rocks seemed ready to topple down upon him at  every step. Through broken clouds a watery moon shed a faint, fitful  light, that came and went as the clouds, driven by a moaning wind,  passed over the valley.    Cuglas, nothing daunted, pushed on boldly until a bank of cloud shut out  completely the struggling moon, and closing over the valley covered it  like a pall, leaving him in perfect darkness. At the same moment the  moaning wind died away, and with it died away all sound. The darkness  and the deathlike silence sent an icy chill to the heart of Cuglas. He  held his hand close to his eyes, but he saw it not. He shouted that he  might hear the sound of his own voice, but he heard it not. He stamped  his foot on the rocky ground, but no sound was returned to him. He  rattled his sword in its brazen scabbard, but it gave no answer back  to him. His heart grew colder and colder, when suddenly the cloud above  him was rent in a dozen places, and lightning flashed through the  valley, and the thunder rolled over the echoing mountains. In the lurid  glare of the lightning Cuglas saw a hundred ghostly forms sweeping  towards him, uttering as they came nearer and nearer shrieks so terrible  that the silence of death could more easily be borne. Cuglas turned to  escape, but they hemmed him round, and pressed their clammy hands upon  his face.    With a yell of horror he drew his sword and slashed about him, and that  very moment the forms vanished, the thunder ceased, the dark cloud  passed, and the sun shone out as bright as on a summer day, and then  Cuglas knew the forms he had seen were those of the wild people of the  glen.[7]    With renewed courage he pursued his way through the valley, and after  three or four windings it took him out upon a sandy desert. He had no  sooner set foot upon the desert than he heard behind him a crashing  sound louder than thunder. He looked around, and he saw that the walls  of mountain through which he had just passed had fallen into the valley,  and filled it up so that he could no longer tell where it had been.    The sun was beating fiercely on the desert, and the sands were almost as  hot as burning cinders; and as Cuglas advanced over them his body became  dried up, and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and when his  thirst was at its height a fountain of sparkling water sprang up in the  burning plain a few paces in front of him; but when he came up quite  close to it and stretched out his parched hands to cool them in the  limpid waters, the fountain vanished as suddenly as it appeared. With  great pain, and almost choking with heat and thirst, he struggled on,  and again the fountain sprang up in front of him and moved before him,  almost within his reach. At last he came to the end of the desert, and  he saw a green hill up which a pathway climbed; but as he came to the  foot of the hill, there, sitting right in his way, was a beautiful fairy  holding out towards him a crystal cup, over the rim of which flowed  water as clear as crystal. Unable to resist the temptation, the prince  seized the cold, bright goblet, and drank the water. When he did so his  thirst vanished, but the fairy, and the green hill, and the burning  desert disappeared, and he was standing in the forest behind the palace  of the fairy queen.    That evening the queen returned, and at the feast she talked as gaily  to the prince as if she knew not of his attempt to leave the Floating  Island, and the prince spoke as gaily as he could to her, although in  his heart there was sadness when he remembered that if he had only  dashed away the crystal cup, he would be at that moment in the royal  banquet hall of Tara, sitting beside the Princess Ailinn.    And he thought the feast would never end; but it was over at last, and  the prince returned to his apartments. And that night, as he lay on his  couch, he kept his eyes fixed upon the window; but hours passed, and  there was no sign of anyone. At long last, and when he had given up all  hope of seeing her, he heard a tapping at the window, and he got up and  opened it, and the little woman came in.    \"You failed again to-day,\" said she--\"failed just at the very moment  when you were about to step on the green hills of Erin. I can give you  only one chance more. It will be your last. The queen will go hunting  in the morning. Join the hunt, and when you are separated from the rest  of the party in the wood throw your reins upon your horse's neck and he  will lead you to the edge of the lake. Then cast this golden bodkin into  the lake in the direction of the mainland, and a golden bridge will be  thrown across, over which you can pass safely to the fields of Erin;  but take care and do not draw your sword, for if you do your steed will  bear you back again to the Floating Island, and here you must remain  forever.\" Then handing the bodkin to the prince, and saying good-by,  the little woman disappeared.    The next morning the queen and the prince and all the court went out  to hunt, and a fleet white deer started out before them, and the royal  party pressed after him in pursuit. The prince's steed outstripped the  others, and when he was alone the prince flung the reins upon his  horse's neck, and before long he came to the edge of the lake.    Then the prince cast the bodkin on to the water, and a golden bridge was"]]]
