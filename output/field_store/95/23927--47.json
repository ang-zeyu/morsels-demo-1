This training is begun by making use of the simplest, i.e., the  common, chords, and when these are known in every key, including those  on the dominant, the pupil is expected to improvise a short piece of  eight bars, the chief feature to be attended to being the rhythm, which  has to be definite and played without hesitation. When perfect  familiarity is obtained with the common chord of each key and with that  of its dominant, another chord is learnt, that on the sub-dominant. With  these three chords alone quite charming little pieces can be played, and  gradually in this manner the pupil has at his command passing notes,  appoggiaturas, cadences, and an unlimited number of chords and  sequences. Then come the rules for modulating from one key to  another, and equal facility in all keys is insisted on. Monsieur  Jaques-Dalcroze's pupils learn to improvise with definite thought and  meaning, nothing unrhythmical is ever allowed, nor any aimless  meandering over the keyboard. For these lessons the pupils are divided  into small groups of not more than six in each, and twice a week these  groups are taken altogether by Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze.    All branches of the work demand perfect concentration of thought and  attention, and such invaluable mental training cannot be too highly  prized, for it is fundamental to success in work of any kind, whatever  it may be.    ETHEL INGHAM.        [Illustration: The Hostel: Interiors.]          LIFE AT HELLERAU      Surely never before has the world held better opportunities for studying  and loving the beautiful and true. One need be but a few days in  Hellerau in order to see some of the many advantages which a stay there  has to offer. For young men and women searching for a profession in  life; for those fresh from school while waiting to discover their  natural bent; for adults who seek a change from their ordinary  surroundings and who wish to improve in culture and in health; for  musicians and students in art, for teachers of dancing, and for children  of all ages, a course of study at the College in Hellerau contains  advantages and opportunities which seem to exist in no other educational  institution.    For the convenience of young girls there is a hall of residence, which  will accommodate about forty-six students, the head of which is a  cultured English lady of wide experience. There are also many small  houses on adjoining land, in which the male students and those who are  older can live. These may, and as a rule do, come to the Hostel for  meals.    The home life in the Hostel is a cheerful one. The bedrooms are bright,  containing just the necessary furniture, which of course includes a  piano. There is a large and charmingly furnished room opening from the  hall, known as the Diele, which serves as a general sitting-room for the  students. The dining-room is equally delightful, and can be quickly  converted into a ball-room for impromptu dances, or adapted for other  entertainments. There is also a library; and throughout the whole house  the same good taste is displayed. Leading from the dining-room is a  large terrace, with steps down into an attractive garden.    The day commences with the sounding of a gong at seven o'clock; the  house is immediately alive, and some are off to the College for a  Swedish gymnastic lesson before breakfast, others breakfast at half-past  seven and have their lesson later. There is always a half hour of  ordinary gymnastics to begin with. Then there will be a lesson in  Solfege, one in Rhythmic Gymnastics, and one in Improvisation, each  lasting for fifty minutes, with an interval of ten minutes between each  lesson.    Dinner, which is at a quarter-past one, is followed by an hour for rest;  and at three the energetic people begin practising. The afternoons are  usually free, except twice a week, when there are lessons in \"Plastic\"  and dancing from four till six, before which tea is served, or there may  be extra lessons in rhythmic gymnastics for small groups of pupils who  need further help, and students may obtain the use of a room for private  practice together. In the afternoons, too, there is time and opportunity  for any other extra study or lessons which are not included in the  ordinary course, such as violin, solo singing, drawing or painting. Most  of the students soon acquire wide interests, if they do not have them  when they first come. Free afternoons may be spent in visiting the  galleries and shops of Dresden. Whenever there is anything especially  good in the way of a concert, or an opera or a classical play, there is  always a party of enthusiasts going into town for it. The opera in  Dresden, as in other parts of Germany, fortunately begins and ends  early. Late hours are not encouraged at the Hostel--indeed, everybody is  glad to retire early, for the work is absorbing and demands plenty of  energy, especially if the full teachers' course be taken, with the hope  of a diploma at the end of two years.        [Illustration: The Hostel.]    Supper is served at a quarter-past seven, and on two evenings a week  those who wish to join the orchestral or choral societies have the  pleasure of meeting together and practising under the direction of  Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze.    An atmosphere of enthusiasm and good-will permeates the social life. No  community of the kind could have a more delightful spirit of unity than  that which pervades the Jaques-Dalcroze School. All students are keen  and anxious to live as full a life as possible, every one will willingly  and unselfishly take time and trouble to help others who know less than  themselves. The College has a unity born of kindred interests, and  every one glows with admiration and esteem for the genius at the head,  and for his wonderful method, whilst he himself simply radiates  good-will and enthusiasm, and works harder than any one else in the  place. He makes a point of knowing each one of his pupils personally,  and remarkably quick he is in summing up the various temperaments and  characters of those with whom he comes into contact.    The moral and mental tone of the College is pure and beautiful, indeed  it could not well be otherwise, for the work in itself is an  inspiration. A change is often observable in pupils after they have been  but a few weeks in residence, a change which tells of more alertness of  mind, of more animated purpose, and even of higher ideals and aims in  life.        [Illustration: Dresden from Hellerau.]    There are opportunities for the practice of many languages, for it is a  cosmopolitan centre. Nearly all European nationalities are represented,  but as yet the number of English people is not large. This, however,  will not long remain so, for the Jaques-Dalcroze method needs only to be  known in order to be as widely appreciated in Great Britain and the  United States as it is on the Continent.    The lessons are given in German, though occasionally French is used to  make clear anything that is not quite understood in the former tongue.  English people who do not know either of these languages need not look  upon this as an obstacle, for one quickly arrives at understanding  sufficiently well to gain the benefit from the lessons, and there is  always some one in the classes who will interpret when necessary.    The College itself is a fine example of the value of simplicity and  space in architecture. Both without and within, the block of buildings  is impressive, this effect being gained by an extreme simplicity of  decoration. The most modern methods of heating and ventilating are  provided, and there are large sun and air baths.    Completed in the spring of this year, and with accommodation for five  hundred students, the settlement stands on high ground about four miles  from Dresden, in an open, bracing, healthy spot, with charming walks in  all directions. The views are extensive; to the south lie the  Erzgebirge, to the south-east Saxon Switzerland, and, in a dip of the  nearer hills, Dresden.    ETHEL INGHAM.          THE VALUE OF EURHYTHMICS TO ART      One of the most marked tendencies of modern aesthetic theory is to break  down the barriers that convention has erected between the various arts.  The truth is coming to be realized that the essential factor of poetry,  painting, sculpture, architecture and music is really of the same  quality, and that one art does not differ from another in anything but  the method of its expression and the conditions connected with that  method.    This common basis to the arts is more easily admitted than defined, but  one important element in it--perhaps the only element that can be given  a name--is rhythm. Rhythm of bodily movement, the dance, is the earliest  form of artistic expression known. It is accompanied in nearly every  case with rude music, the object being to emphasize the beat and  rhythmic movement with sound. The quickness with which children respond  to simple repetition of beat, translating the rhythm of the music into  movement, is merely recurrence of historical development.    Words with the music soon follow, and from these beginnings--probably  war-songs or religious chants--come song-poems and ultimately poetry as  we know it to-day. The still more modern development of prose-writing,  in the stylistic sense, is merely a step further.    The development on the other side follows a somewhat similar line. The  rhythm of the dancing figure is reproduced in rude sculpture and  bas-relief, and then in painting.        [Illustration: A Plastic Exercise.]    So we have, as it were, a scale of the arts, with music at its centre  and prose-writing and painting at its two extremes. From end to end of  the scale runs the unifying desire for rhythm.[1]        [1]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#8)"],[1," to the left of the pupils. The teacher--a man with gray  hair and beard, but young enough as to vivacity and enthusiasm, and a  gentleman in manners--bowed me to the chair he offered, and with a  wave of the hand bade the children, who had risen on our entrance, be  seated. The lesson was wholly oral and mental. Addition, subtraction,  and multiplication were carried on by means of numbers, given out with  so much vivacity and judgment that every eye was fastened on the  teacher and every mind alert. Most of the right hands were raised for  answer to every question, with the index finger extended; and the  pupil selected was chosen now here, now there, to give it audibly.  Rank was observed from left to right, the lower changing places with  the higher whenever a failure above and a correct answer below paved  the way. Large numbers were often used; for example, adding or  subtracting by sixties, and multiplying far beyond twelve times  twelve,--all apparently with equal facility. The second half of the  hour was devoted to a visit to a class of younger girls. Another  arithmetic class, taught by a younger gentleman; the pupils were in  the eighth class, or second year at school,--age about seven. The room  accommodated the same number, and was lighted and furnished in a  similar way. Here figures were written on the blackboard by the  teacher. The early part of the lesson had evidently been in addition;  now it was subtraction, which was carefully explained by the pupils,  and the hour closed by a few mental exercises in concert. In the ten  minutes' recess which followed, I again chatted with the teachers in  their private room. Thirty teachers are employed to teach these eight  hundred girls,--twenty gentlemen and ten ladies. I said that in  America the lady teachers largely outnumbered the gentlemen. The lady  with whom I was conversing replied that the upper classes in girls'  schools were all taught by gentlemen, as the ladies were not prepared  to pass the required examinations for these positions. \"The gentlemen  have a course in the _Gymnasium_ about equal to that in your  colleges,\" she said, \"and then pursue a course in the University, in  order to fit themselves for teachers.\" \"The expense of this is too  much for ladies?\" I inquired. \"Yes; and they have not the opportunity.  They are not admitted to the University of Berlin, and then--women  have not the strength for such hard studies\"! \"How many recitations do  you hear?\" I asked. \"The lady teachers, twenty-two per week; the  gentlemen, twenty-four.\" \"The salaries of the gentlemen are higher?\"  \"Oh yes, much higher. They have families to support; and then, the  ladies are unsteady,--they often marry.\"    I was now conducted to the upper division of the first class; girls in  the last of the nine years' course of study,--ages about fourteen to  sixteen. This was the only class reciting in English, which within a  few years has been made a part of the required course, as well as  French. They were reading in little paper-covered books, in German  text, the _Geisterseher_ of Schiller, and translating the same into  English. The teacher was an English gentleman. He wrote occasionally a  word on the blackboard, when he wished to explain or impress upon the  memory a term or a synonym,--as, for instance, \"temporarily,\" and the  words \"soften,\" \"mitigate,\" \"assuage,\"--and corrected such mistakes in  translation as \"guess to\" for \"guess at,\" and \"declaration\" for  \"explanation.\"    The second division of this first class was in German history. Several  of the pupils had historical atlases open before them, which covered  the history of the world from the most ancient times to the present,  prepared with that excellence which has made German maps famous. The  compendium used for a class-book was a brief record of dates and  events in Roman type, which is gradually but surely superseding the  old German letters. The teacher talked of the quarrel between popes  and emperors in the Middle Ages, and especially of the wars of the  Investitures. Passing through the corridor after this recitation, I  inquired the use of a library there, consisting of several hundred  volumes, and was told it was for the use of the teachers; and that  there was also one for the use of the pupils, from which they might  draw books to read at home,--\"some amusing and some instructive.\"    As \"Religion\" is marked in the schedule of instruction, and in the  weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports sent to the parents, I asked to  see the text-book, and was shown two or three. That for the younger  pupils was simple, after the manner of our \"Bible Stories,\" of the  Creation, \"Joseph and his Brethren,\" etc. That for the upper classes  consisted of several catechisms bound in one, including \"Luther's,\"  and supplemented by a number of Psalms, as the 1st, 15th, 23d, 130th,  to be committed to memory.    I asked if sewing and knitting were taught, and was answered in the  affirmative. \"Is there a teacher for sewing only?\" I asked. \"No;  formerly there was, but now the teaching of sewing and knitting is  distributed among all the lady teachers. The teachers have more  influence with the pupils in this way.\" A wise remark; as only a  sewing-teacher of exceptional force and ability can have an influence  with the pupils to be compared with that of those who teach them  literature. Embroidery is taught, but only \"useful embroidery,\" as the  beautiful initial-work on all bed and table linen in Germany is  called. Some of that shown me in the sewing-room I now visited was  exquisite, but was outdone, if possible, by the darning. Over a small  cushion, encased in white cotton cloth, a coarse fabric of stiff  threads is pinned, after a square has been cut out from it. This hole  the pupil is to replace by darning, composed of white and colored  threads. In this instance blue and white threads were woven about the  pin-heads inserted at some distance outside the edges of the hole, one  for each thread. The darning replaces the fabric, not only with  neatness and strength, but in ornamental patterns. Squares, plaids,  herringbone and lozenge patterns were done by this process in such a  manner as to be very handsome.    We now descended to the ground floor, where was a large gymnasium,  fitted up simply, but with a variety of apparatus. A teacher is  employed for gymnastics only, but for the reason that until recently  the other teachers have not had opportunity to prepare for the  examinations, so strict in Germany on every branch. The children here  were among the youngest in the school, and were well taught by a lady,  but with nothing in the method worthy of special note. The last  half-hour, I listened to a recitation in geography. Girls of ten to  twelve were numbering and naming the bridges of Berlin, as I entered,  and the recitation continued for some time on the topography and  boundaries of their own city. A few general questions were given on  Germany and its boundaries, and the passes of the Alps, especially the  Simplon; and the First Napoleon came in for a little discussion. The  whole method and result in this class were admirable.    The teachers seemed to expect I would come again on the morrow, as I  had not visited all the classes; and my thanks for the hospitality and  full opportunity of inspection which I had so much enjoyed, were  mingled with the apology I felt was needed, that my engagements would  not permit another visit to the school.    I next sought and obtained an introduction to a Girls' High School.  This was under the patronage of the Empress Augusta, and was said, in  furnishing and equipment, to be the best in the city. The building is  a good one, and the furniture more nearly approaching to that of the  best schools in American cities. We went into two or three classes,  but were not particularly impressed, favorably or unfavorably, with  the methods of instruction. Not so in the gymnastic rooms, where we  went to view the exercises of the Normal class, soon to be graduated.  No courtesy was shown us by the master in charge, but we were  tolerantly allowed to take seats. Here were young women about eighteen  years of age, going through some of the more active exercises, in a  large and well-fitted room, without a breath of outer air, in sleeves  so close that their arms were partly raised with difficulty; so  tightly laced about the waist that the blood rushed to their faces  whenever they attempted the running exercise sometimes required, and  with long skirts and the highest of French heels! And yet this is a  country in which a woman is not considered capable of instructing the  higher classes in gymnastics!    I now essayed to visit a representative girls' school carried on by  private enterprise. The one to which I obtained introduction--and this  was always a particular matter, the time of the visit being arranged  some days previous by correspondence--was under the patronage of the  then Crown Princess, Victoria, whose portrait hung in a conspicuous  place in the elegantly furnished drawing-room into which I was first  shown. Soon the principal appeared,--a lady, who from a small  beginning about fifteen years before had brought the enterprise to its  present successful stage, with several hundred pupils in annual  attendance. There were a number of governesses, and about thirty  pupils resident in the family, the remainder being day-pupils. When  asked what I would like to see, as this was a private school, and I  knew nothing of its methods, I replied that I would leave the  particulars of my visit to the lady in charge. She still hesitated,  when I suggested that I should feel interested to visit a class in  mathematics. The lady lifted her hands in astonishment. \"Mathematics!  for girls? Never! We aim to fit girls to become good wives and  mothers,--not to teach them mathematics!\" \"Do you have no classes in  arithmetic?\" I asked. \"Yes, some"]]]
