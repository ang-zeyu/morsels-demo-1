The egrets police the eland and capture all predatory ticks,  while the rhino usually has half a dozen little tick birds sitting upon  him.    However, we were starting out in a day or so, and in a few days expected  to learn a lot more about ticks than we then knew.    It is supposed to require a certain amount of nerve to go lion shooting.  It is also supposed to require an additional amount to face an angry  rhino or to attempt to get African buffalo. The last-named creature is a  vindictive, crafty beast that is feared by old African hunters more than  they fear any other animal. In consequence of these dangers we decided  that it might be well to give our nerves a thorough test before going  out with them. If they were not in good condition it would be well to  know of it before rather than after going up against a strange and  hostile lion.    That is why we went up in the balloon in Nairobi. The balloon was one of  the two Boyce balloons and had never been tried. It was small, of twelve  thousand cubic feet capacity, as compared with the seventy thousand foot  balloons that do the racing. It was also being tried at an altitude of  over five thousand feet under uncertain wind and heat conditions, and so  the element of uncertainty was aggravated. We felt that if we could go  up in a new balloon of a small size it might demonstrate whether we  should later go up a tree or stand pat against a charging menagerie.    There was a great crowd gathered on the hill where this balloon was  being inflated. Since five o'clock in the morning the gas had been  generating in the wooden tanks, and from these was being conducted by a  cloth tube to the mouth of the balloon. The natives squatted wonderingly  about in a circle, mystified and excited. At three o'clock the balloon  was over half filled and was swaying savagely at its anchorage. A strong  wind was blowing, and Mr. Lawrence, who had charge of the ascension, was  apprehensive. He feared to fill the balloon to its capacity lest the  expansion of the gas due to the hot sun should explode it.    At half past three the basket was attached and it looked small--about  the size of a large bushel basket, three feet in diameter and three feet  deep. The balloon, heavily laden with sand-bags, was lightened until it  could almost rise, and in this condition was led across to an open spot  sufficiently far from the nearest trees. The crowd thronged up pop-eyed  and quivering with excitement. Then there was a long wait until the wind  had died down a bit, which it did after a while. The eventful moment had  arrived, and Mr. Stephenson, of our party, climbed into the basket. He  is only six feet five inches in height and weighs only two hundred and  thirty pounds. He had on a pair of heavy hunting boots, for we were  leaving for the hunting grounds immediately after the ascension. One by  one the restraining bags of sand were taken off, but still the balloon  sat on the ground without any inclination to do otherwise.    A wave of disappointment spread over the crowd. Suddenly a brilliant  inspiration struck the gallant aeronaut. He took off one of his heavy  hunting boots and cast it overboard. The balloon arose a foot or two and  then sagged back to earth. Then the other boot was cast over and the  balloon rose several feet, swaying and whipping savagely over the heads  of the crowd. The wind was now blowing pretty hard, and when the wire  was run out the balloon started almost horizontally for the nearest  tree, rising slightly.    [Drawing: _Throwing Out Ballast_]    The wire was stopped at once and the balloon thus suddenly restrained,  changed its horizontal course to an upward one. At about sixty feet up  the wire was again paid out and the balloon made a dash for the trees  again. Once more the balloon was stopped and rose to a height of one  hundred and fifty feet, where it swayed about with the pleasant face of  Stephenson looking over the edge of the basket. He had to sit down, as  there was not room to stand. The ascension seemed a failure with the  handicap of two hundred and thirty pounds, and so the balloon was reeled  down to the earth again. It was not a great ascension, but the amateur  aeronaut had gained the distinction of making the first balloon  ascension ever made in East Africa. He would have gone higher if his  shoes had been heavier.    To me fell the next chance, and I knew that my one hundred and forty  pounds would not seriously handicap the balloon. Once more there was a  long wait until the wind died down, and all of a sudden the cylinder of  wire was released and the ground sank hundreds of feet below me. The  horizon widened and the whole vast plain of the African highlands  stretched out with an ever-widening horizon. New mountain peaks rose far  away and native villages with ant-like people moving about appeared in  unexpected quarters. Away below, the crowd of people looked like little  insects as they gazed up at the balloon. Grasping the ropes that led  from the basket to the balloon, I stood and waved at them and could hear  the shouts come up from a thousand feet below.    I was not frightened. There was no sensation of motion as long as the  balloon was ascending. Aside from looking at the wonderful scene that  opened out before me, I believe I thought chiefly about where I should  land in case the wire broke. The balloon would undoubtedly go many miles  before descending, and five miles in any direction would lead me into a  primitive jungle or veldt. A hundred miles would take me into almost  unexplored districts in some directions, where the natives would greet  me as some supernatural being. Perhaps I might be greeted as a god  and--just in the midst of these reflections they began to reel in the  balloon. The sudden stopping was not pleasant, for then the balloon  began to sway. Slowly the earth came nearer and the wind howled through  the rigging and the partly filled bag flapped and thundered. The wire,  about as thick as a piano wire, looked frail, but at last after a slow  and tedious descent a safe landing was made amid the wondering natives.  Cameras clicked and the moving picture machine worked busily as the  balloon was secured to earth again.    To Mrs. Akeley of our party fell the next chance to go up. As she was  lifted into the basket the feminine population of Nairobi gazed in  wonder that a woman should dare venture up in a balloon. The cameras  clicked some more, somebody shook hands with her, and it began to look  quite like a leave-taking. Just when all was ready the wind sprang up  savagely and an ascension seemed inexpedient. There was a long wait and  still the wind continued in gusts. At last it was determined that we  might as well settle down for better conditions, so Mrs. Akeley was  lifted out and we waited impatiently for the wind to die down.    At last it died down, all was hurriedly prepared for the ascension, and  Mrs. Akeley took her place again in the basket. In an instant the  balloon shot up a couple of hundred feet and was held there for a  moment. The wind once more sprang up and the balloon was drawn down amid  the cheers of the crowd. She had been the first woman to make an  ascension in British East Africa, if not in all of Africa.    We then mounted our mules and rode out on the open plains. Several hours  before, our entire camp had moved and we were to join them at a  prearranged spot out on the Athi Plains. All our preliminary worries  were over and at last we were actually started. At six o'clock, far  across the country we saw the gleaming lights of our camp-fires and the  green tents that were to be our homes for many weeks to come. Enormous  herds of hartebeest and wildebeest were on each side, and countless  zebras. That night two of us heard the first bark of the zebra, and we  thought it must be the bark of distant dogs. It was one of our first  surprises to learn that zebras bark instead of neigh.          CHAPTER V    INTO THE HEART OF THE BIG GAME COUNTRY WITH A RETINUE OF MORE THAN ONE  HUNDRED NATIVES. A SAFARI AND WHAT IT IS      When I first expressed my intention of going to East Africa to shoot big  game some of my friends remarked, in surprise: \"Why, I didn't know that  you were so bloodthirsty!\" They seemed to think that the primary object  of such an expedition was to slay animals, none of which had done  anything to me, and that to wish to embark in any such project was an  evidence of bloodthirstiness. I tried to explain that I had no  particular grudge against any of the African fauna, and that the thing I  chiefly desired to do was to get out in the open, far from the picture  post-card, and enjoy experiences which could not help being wonderful  and strange and perhaps exciting.    The shooting of animals merely for the sake of killing them is, of  course, not an elevating sport, but the by-products of big game hunting  in Africa are among the most delightful and inspiring of all  experiences. For weeks or months you live a nomadic tent life amid  surroundings so different from what you are accustomed to that one is  both mentally and physically rejuvenated. You are among strange and  savage people, in strange and savage lands, and always threatened by  strange and savage animals. The life is new and the scenery new. There  is adventure and novelty in every day of such a life, and it is that  phase of it that has the most insistent appeal. It is the call of the  wild to which the pre-Adamite monkey in our nature responds.    Even if one never used his rifle one would still enjoy life on _safari_.  _Safari_ is an Arabic word meaning expedition as it is understood in  that country. If you go on any sort of a trip you are on _safari_. It  need not be a shooting trip.    Of course everybody who has read the magazines of the last year has been  more or less familiarized with African hunting. He has read of the  amount of game that the authors have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#8)"],[1,"loggia.    \"Mr. Cavanagh!\"    I laughed dryly at my own cowardice, but my heart was still beating  abnormally.    \"Here I am, Bristol, in a ghastly funk!\"    \"I don't wonder!  They may be on us any time now.  All's well at  the gate, but Morris says he heard, or thought he heard something  at the side of the chapel opposite, a while ago.\"    \"Wind in the bushes?\"    \"It may have been; but he says there was no breeze at the time.\"    We resumed our seats.    \"Bristol,\" I said, \"now that the danger grows imminent, doesn't it  seem to you foolhardy for us thus to expose ourselves?\"    \"Perhaps it is,\" he agreed; \"but how otherwise are we likely to  learn what happened to Marden and West?\"    \"The enemy may adopt different measures to-night.\"    \"I think not.  Our dispositions are the same, and I credit them with  cunning enough to know it.  At the same time I credit ourselves with  having kept the existence of the steel traps completely secret.  They  will assume (so I've reasoned) that we intend to rely entirely upon  our superior vigilance, therefore they will try the same game as last  night.\"    Silence fell.    The moon rays, creeping around from the right of the avenue, crossing  the shrubbery and encroaching upon the low wall of the loggia, now  flooded its floor.  Against the silvern light, Bristol appeared to  me in black silhouette.  The breeze, too, seemed now to blow from a  slightly different direction.  It came through the windows on my  right, beyond which lay the unkempt bushes which extended on that  side to the wall of the grounds.    So we sat, until the moonlight poured fully in upon Bristol's back.  So we sat when the clock chimed the hour of one.    Bristol arose and once more went out to the gate.  He had arranged  to visit Morris's post every half-hour.  Again I experienced the  nervous dread that he would be attacked in the avenue; but again he  returned unscathed.    \"All's well,\" he said.    But from his tones I knew that he had not forgotten that it was at  this hour Marden and West had suffered mysterious attack.    Neither of us, I think, was disposed to talk.  We both were  unwilling to break the silence, wherein, with all our ears, we  listened for the slightest disturbance.    And now my attention turned anew to the course of the slowly creeping  moon rays.  In my mind an idea was struggling for definition.  There  was something significant in the lunar lighting of the room.  Why, I  asked myself, had the attack been made at one o'clock?  Did the time  signify anything?  If so, what?  I looked toward Bristol.    His figure, the chair upon which he sat, were sharply outlined by  the cold light.  The wall behind me, and to my left, was illuminated  brilliantly; but no light fell directly upon me.    The idea was taking shape.  From the loggia and the avenue Bristol,  I reasoned, must be clearly visible.  From the shrubbery on the  south, through the other windows could I be seen?  Yes, silhouetted  against the moonlight!    A faint sound, quite indescribable, came to my ears from somewhere  outside-beyond.    \"My God!\" whispered Bristol.  \"Did you hear it?\"    \"Yes!  What?\"    \"It must have been Morris!--\"    Bristol was half standing, one hand upon the arm of the chair, the  other concealed, but grasping his revolver as I well knew.  I, too,  had my revolver in my hand, and as I twisted in my seat, preparatory  to rising, in sheer nervousness I dropped the weapon upon the  carpet.    With an exclamation of dismay, I stooped quickly to recover it.    As I did so something whistled past my ear, so closely as almost to  touch it--and struck with a dull thud upon the wall beyond!    \"Bristol!\" I whispered.    But as I raised my eyes to him he seemed to crumple up, and fell  loosely forward into the patch of moonlight spread upon the floor!  \"God in heaven!\" I said aloud.    In a cold sweat of fear I crouched there, for it had become evident  to me that, as I bent, I was entirely in shadow.    There was a rustling in the bushes on the left; but before I could  turn in that direction, my attention was claimed elsewhere.  Over  into the loggia leapt an almost naked brown figure!    It was that of a small but strongly built man, who carried a short,  exceedingly thick bamboo rod in his hand.  My fear was too great to  admit of my accurately observing anything at that time, but I  noticed that some kind of leather thong or loop was attached to the  end of the squat cane.    The panic fear of the supernatural was strongly upon me, and I was  unable to realize that this Eastern apparition was a creature of  flesh and blood.  With my nerves strung up to snapping point, I  crouched watching him.  He entered the room, bending over the body  of Bristol.    A hot breath fanned my cheek!    At that my overwrought nerves betrayed me.  I uttered a stifled cry,  looking upward ... and into a pair of gleaming eyes which looked  down into mine!    A second brown man (who must have entered by one of the windows  overlooking the shrubbery) was bending over me!    Scarce knowing what I did, I raised my revolver and blazed straight  into the dimly-seen face.  Down upon me silently dropped a naked  body, and something warm came flowing over my hand.  But, knowing my  foes to be of flesh and blood, feeling myself at handgrips now with  a palpable enemy, I threw off the body, leapt up and fired, though  blindly, at the flying shape that flashed across the loggia--and  was lost in the shadow pools under the elms.    Upon the din of my shooting fell silence like a cloak.  A moment I  listened, tense, still; then I turned to the table and lighted the  lamp.    In its light I saw Bristol lying like a dead man.  Close beside him  was a big and heavy lump of clay.  It had been shaped as a ball,  but now it was flattened out curiously.  Bending over my unfortunate  companion and learning that, though unconscious, he lived, I learnt,  too, how the Hashishin contrived to strike men insensible without  approaching them; I learnt that the one whom I had shot, who lay in  his blood almost on the spot where Professor Deeping once had lain,  was an expert slinger.    The contrivance which he carried, as did the other who had escaped,  was a sling, of the ancient Persian type.  In place of stones, heavy  lumps of clay were used, which operated much the same as a sand-bag,  whilst enabling the operator to work from a considerable distance.    Hidden, over by the ancient chapel it might be, one of this evil  twain had struck down Morris, the constable; from the shelter of the  trees, from many yards away, they had shot their singular missiles  through the open windows at Bristol and myself.  Bristol had  succumbed, and now, with a redness showing through his close-cut  hair immediately behind the right ear, lay wholly unconscious at my  feet.    It had been a divine accident which had caused me to drop my  revolver, and, stooping to recover it, unknowingly to frustrate the  design of the second slinger upon myself.  The light of the lamp  fell upon the face of the dead Hashishin.  He lay forward upon his  hands, crouching almost, but with his face, his dreadful,  featureless face, twisted up at me from under his left shoulder.    God knows he deserved his end; but that mutilated face is often  grinning, bloodily, in my dreams.    And then as I stood, between that horrid exultation which is born  of killing and the panic which threatened me out of the darkness,  I saw something advancing ... slowly ... slowly ... from the  elmen shades toward the loggia.    It was a shape--it was a shadow.  Silent it came--on--and on.  Where the dusk lay deepest it paused, undefined; for I could give  it no name of man or spirit.  But a horror seemed to proceed from  it as light from a lamp.    I groped about the table near to me, never taking my eyes from  that sinister form outside.  As my fingers closed upon the  telephone, distant voices and the sound of running footsteps  (of those who had heard the shots) came welcome to my ears.    The form stirred, seeming to raise phantom arms in execration, and  a stray moonbeam pierced the darkness shrouding it.  For a fleeting  instant something flashed venomously.    The sounds grew nearer.  I could tell that the newcomers had found  Morris lying at the gate.  Yet still I stood, frozen with uncanny  fear, and watching--watching the spot to which that stray beam had  pierced; the spot where I had seen the moon gleam upon the ring of  the Prophet!          CHAPTER X    AT THE BRITISH ANTIQUARIAN MUSEUM      A little group of interested spectators stood at the head of the  square glass case in the centre of the lofty apartment in the  British Antiquarian Museum known as the Burton Room (by reason of  the fact that a fine painting of Sir Richard Burton faces you as  you enter).  A few other people looked on curiously from the lower  end of the case.  It contained but one exhibit--a dirty and  dilapidated markoob--or slipper of morocco leather that had once  been red.    \"Our latest acquisition, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Mostyn, the curator,  speaking in a low tone to the distinguished Oriental scholars  around him.  \"It has been left to the Institution by the late  Professor Deeping.  He describes it in a document furnished by his  solicitor as one of the slippers worn by the Prophet Mohammed, but  gives us no further particulars.  I myself cannot quite place the  relic.\"    \"Nor I,\" interrupted one of the group.  \"It is not mentioned by  any of the Arabian historians to my knowledge--that is, if it  comes from Mecca, as I understand it does.\"    \"I cannot possibly assert that it comes from Mecca, Dr. Nicholson,\"  Mostyn replied.  \"The Professor may have taken it from Al-Madinah--perhaps  from the mysterious inner passage of the baldaquin where  the treasures of the place lie.  But I can assure you that what  little we do know of its history is sufficiently unsavoury.\"    I fancied that the curator's"]]]
