The history of invention is full of illustrations of  men who have starved with valuable patents standing in their  names--patents which have proved the basis of large fortunes to those  who were competent to develop the wealth that was in them. How often,  too, do we see capable and ingenious and skillful mechanics confined  through life to a small shop, or to a subordinate position in a large  shop, solely through their inability to manage the affairs of a larger  business. On the other hand, it is no uncommon thing to see what might  be a profitable business--which has been fairly thrust upon a lucky  inventor or manufacturer by the urgency of popular needs--fail  disastrously through ignorance of business methods and inability to  conduct properly the larger affairs which fell to the owner's hand.    Of course a business training is not the only condition of success in  life. Many have it and fail; others begin without it and succeed,  gaining a working knowledge of business affairs through the exigencies  of their own increasing business needs. Nevertheless, in whatever line  in life a man's course may fall, a practical business training will be  no hinderance to him, while the lack of it may be a serious hinderance.  The school of experience is by no means to be despised. To many it is  the only school available. But unhappily its teachings are apt to come  too late, and often they are fatally expensive. Whoever can attain the  needed knowledge in a quicker and cheaper way will obviously do well so  to obtain it; and the supplying of such practical knowledge, and the  training which may largely take the place of experience in actual  business, is the proper function of the true business college.    Our purpose in this writing, however, was not so much to enlarge upon  the utility of business colleges, properly so called, as to describe the  practical working of a representative institution, choosing for the  purpose Packard's Business College in this city.    This school was established in 1858, under the name of Bryant, Stratton  & Packard's Mercantile College, by Mr. S. S. Packard, the present  proprietor. It formed the New York link in the chain of institutions  known as the Bryant & Stratton chain of business colleges, which  ultimately embraced fifty co working schools in the principal cities of  the United States and Canada. In 1867 Mr. Packard purchased the Bryant &  Stratton interest in the New York College, and changed its name to  Packard's Business College, retaining the good will and all the co  operative advantages of the Bryant & Stratton association. The original  purpose of the college, as its name implies, was the education of young  men for business pursuits. The experience of over twenty years has led  to many improvements in the working of the school, and to a considerable  enlargement of its scope and constituency, which now includes adults as  well as boys, especial opportunities being offered to mature men who  want particular instruction in arithmetic, bookkeeping, penmanship,  correspondence, and the like.    [Illustration: LECTURE AND RECITATION ROOM.]    The teachers employed in the college are chosen for their practical as  well as their theoretical knowledge of business affairs, and every  effort is made to secure timeliness and accuracy in their teachings.  Constant intercourse is kept up with the departments at Washington as to  facts and changes in financial matters, and also with prominent business  houses in this and other cities. Among the recent letters received in  correspondence of this sort are letters from the Secretary of State of  every State in the Union with regard to rates of interest and usury  laws, and letters from each of our city banks as to methods of reckoning  time on paper, the basis of interest calculations, the practices  concerning deposit balances, and other business matters subject to  change. The aim of the proprietor is to keep the school abreast of the  demands of the business world, and to omit nothing, either in his  methods or their enforcement, necessary to carry out his purpose  honestly and completely. An idea of the superior housing of the college  will be obtained from the views of half a dozen of the rooms at No 805  Broadway, as shown in this issue of the Scientific American--the finest,  largest, most compact, and convenient suite of rooms anywhere used for  this purpose.    The college is open for students ten months of the year, five days each  week, from half past nine in the morning until half past two in the  afternoon. Students can enter at any time with equal advantage, the  instruction being for the most part individual. The course of study can  be completed in about a year. The proprietor holds that with this amount  of study a boy of seventeen should be able--    1. To take a position as assistant bookkeeper in almost any kind of  business; 2. To do the ordinary correspondence of a business house, so  far as good writing, correct spelling, grammatical construction, and  mechanical requisites are concerned; 3. To do the work of an entry clerk  or cashier; 4. To place himself in the direct line of promotion to any  desirable place in business or life, with the certainty of holding his  own at every step.    In this the student will have the advantage over the uneducated clerk of  the same age and equal worth and capacity, in that he will understand  more or less practically as well as theoretically the duties of those  above him, and will thus be able to advance to more responsible  positions as rapidly as his years and maturity may justify. It is  obvious that the knowledge which makes an expert accountant will in all  probability suffice for the general business requirements of  professional men, the inheritors of property and business,  manufacturers, mechanics, and others to whom bookkeeping and other  business arts are useful aids, but not the basis of a trade. For the  last-named classes, and for women, shorter periods of study are  provided, and may be made productive of good results.    A sufficient idea of the general working of the college may be obtained  by following a student through the several departments. After the  preliminary examination a student who is to take the regular course of  study enters the initiatory room. Here he begins with the rudiments of  bookkeeping, the study which marks his gradation. The time not given to  the practice of writing, and to recitations in other subjects, is  devoted to the study of accounts. He is required, first, to write up in  \"skeleton\" form--that is, to place the dates and amounts of the several  transactions under the proper ledger titles--six separate sets of books,  or the record of six different business ventures, wherein are exhibited  as great a variety of operations as possible, with varying results of  gains and losses, and the adjustment thereof in the partners' accounts,  or in the account of the sole proprietor. After getting the results in  this informal way--which is done in order as quickly as possible to get  the theory of bookkeeping impressed upon his mind--he is required to go  over the work again carefully, writing up with neatness and precision  all the principal and auxiliary books, with the documents which should  accompany the transactions, such as notes, drafts, checks, receipts,  invoices, letters, etc. The work in this department will occupy an  industrious and intelligent student from four to six weeks, depending  upon his quickness of perception and his working qualities. While  progressing in his bookkeeping, he is pursuing the collateral studies, a  certain attainment in which is essential to promotion, especially  correcting any marked deficiency in spelling, arithmetic, and the use of  language.    Upon a satisfactory examination the student now passes to the second  department, where a wider scope of knowledge in accounts is opened to  him, with a large amount of practical detail familiarizing him with the  actual operations of business. The greatest care is taken to prevent  mere copying and to throw the student upon his own resources, by  obliging him to correct his own blunders, and to work out his own  results; accepting nothing as final that has not the characteristics of  real business. Much care is bestowed in this department upon the form  and essential matter of business paper, and especially of  correspondence. A great variety of letters is required to be written on  assigned topics and in connection with the business which is recorded,  and thorough instruction is given in the law of negotiable paper,  contracts, etc. During all this time the student devotes from half an  hour to an hour daily to penmanship, a plain, practical, legible hand  being aimed at, to the exclusion of superfluous lines and flourishes. It  is expected that the work in the first and second departments will  establish the student in the main principles of bookkeeping, in its  general theories, and their application to ordinary transactions.    In the third department the student takes an advanced position, and is  expected, during the two or three months he will remain in this  department, to perfect himself in the more subtle questions involved in  accounts, as well as to shake off the crude belongings of schoolboy  work. He will be required to use his mind in everything he does--to  depend as much as possible upon himself. The work which he presents for  approval here must have the characteristics of business. His letters,  statements, and papers of all kinds are critically examined, and  approved only when giving evidence of conscientious work, as well as  coming up to strict business requirements. Before he leaves this  department he should be versed in all the theories of accounts, should  write an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#8)"],[1,"sleep with his window open both summer and winter. The school,  said the new scholar, has only about four hundred and ninety fellows in  it, which was considered uncommonly small. He likes his tutor so much  that he would not exchange him for any ten. He has various rows with  Mrs. Shurey, his dame, and it is really a great shame the way they are  fed. He and his brother have far the best room in the dame's house. His  captain is very good-natured. Fighting is a favourite diversion, hardly  a day passing without one, two, three, or even four more or less mortal  combats.                             MANNERS AT ETON    You will be glad to hear, he writes to his Highland aunt Johanna  (November 13, 1821), of an instance of the highest and most honourable  spirit in a highlander labouring under great disadvantages. His name is  Macdonald (he once had a brother here remarkably clever, and a capital  fighter). He is tough as iron, and about the strongest fellow in the  school of his size. Being pushed out of his seat in school by a fellow  of the name of Arthur, he airily asked him to give it him again, which  being refused, with the additional insult that he might try what he  could do to take it from him, Macdonald very properly took him at his  word, and began to push him out of his seat. Arthur struck at him with  all his might, and gave him so violent a blow that Macdonald was almost  knocked backwards, but disdaining to take a blow from even a fellow much  bigger than himself, he returned Arthur's blow with interest; they began  to fight; after Macdonald had made him bleed at both his nose and his  mouth, he finished the affair very triumphantly by knocking the arrogant  Arthur backwards over the form without receiving a single blow of any  consequence. He also labours under the additional disadvantage of being  a new fellow, and of not knowing any one here. Arthur in a former battle  put his finger out of joint, and as soon as it is recovered they are to  have a regular battle in the playing fields.    Other encounters are described with equal zest, especially one where  'the honour of Liverpool was bravely sustained,' superior weight and  size having such an advantage over toughness and strength, that the foe  of Liverpool was too badly bruised and knocked about to appear in  school. On another occasion, 'to the great joy' of the narrator, an  oppidan vanquished a colleger, though the colleger fought so furiously  that he put his fingers out of joint, and went back to the classic  studies that soften manners, with a face broken and quite black. The  Windsor and Slough coaches used to stop under the wall of the playing  fields to watch these desperate affrays, and once at least in these  times a boy was killed. With plenty of fighting went on plenty of  flogging; for the headmaster was the redoubtable Dr. Keate, with whom  the appointed instrument of moral regeneration in the childish soul was  the birch rod; who on heroic occasions was known to have flogged over  eighty boys on a single summer day; and whose one mellow regret in the  evening of his life was that he had not flogged far more. Religious  instruction, as we may suppose, was under these circumstances reduced to  zero; there was no trace of the influence of the evangelical party, at  that moment the most active of all the religious sections; and the  ancient and pious munificence of Henry VI. now inspired a scene that was  essentially little better than pagan, modified by an official church of  England varnish. At Eton, Mr. Gladstone wrote of this period forty years  after, 'the actual teaching of Christianity was all but dead, though  happily none of its forms had been surrendered.'[23]    Science even in its rudiments fared as ill as its eternal rival,  theology. There was a mathematical master, but nobody learned anything  from him, or took any notice of him. In his anxiety for position the  unfortunate man asked Keate if he might wear a cap and gown. 'That's as  you please,' said Keate. 'Must the boys touch their hats to me?' 'That's  as they please,' replied the genial doctor.[24] Gladstone first picked  up a little mathematics, not at Eton, but during the holidays, going to  Liverpool for the purpose, first in 1824 and more seriously in 1827. He  seems to have paid much attention to French, and even then to have  attained considerable proficiency. 'When I was at Eton,' Mr. Gladstone  said, 'we knew very little indeed, but we knew it accurately.' 'There  were many shades of distinction,' he observed, 'among the fellows who  received what was supposed to be, and was in many respects, their  education. Some of those shades of distinction were extremely  questionable, and the comparative measures of honour allotted to talent,  industry, and idleness were undoubtedly such as philosophy would not  justify. But no boy was ever estimated either more or less because he  had much money to spend. It added nothing to him if he had much, it took  nothing from him if he had little.' A sharp fellow who worked, and a  stupid fellow who was idle, were both of them in good odour enough, but  a stupid boy who presumed to work was held to be an insufferable  solecism.[25]                               KNOWLEDGE AT ETON         My tutor was the Rev. H. H. Knapp (practically all tutors were       clergymen in those days). He was a reputed whig, an easy and       kind-tempered man with a sense of scholarship, but no power of       discipline, and no energy of desire to impress himself upon his       pupils. I recollect but one piece of advice received later from       him. It was that I should form my poetical taste upon Darwin, whose       poems (the 'Botanic Garden' and 'Loves of the Plants') I obediently       read through in consequence. I was placed in the middle remove       fourth form, a place slightly better than the common run, but       inferior to what a boy of good preparation or real excellence would       have taken. My nearest friend of the first period was W. W. Parr, a       boy of intelligence, something over my age, next above me in the       school.         At this time there was not in me any desire to know or to excel. My       first pursuits were football and then cricket; the first I did not       long pursue, and in the second I never managed to rise above       mediocrity and what was termed 'the twenty-two.' There was a       barrister named Henry Hall Joy, a connection of my father through       his first wife, and a man who had taken a first-class at Oxford. He       was very kind to me, and had made some efforts to inspire me with a       love of books, if not of knowledge. Indeed I had read Froissart,       and Hume with Smollett, but only for the battles, and always       skipping when I came to the sections headed 'A Parliament.' Joy had       a taste for classics, and made visions for me of honours at Oxford.       But the subject only danced before my eyes as a will-of-the-wisp,       and without attracting me. I remained stagnant without heart or       hope. A change however arrived about Easter 1822. My 'remove' was       then under Hawtrey (afterwards head-master and provost), who was       always on the lookout for any bud which he could warm with a little       sunshine.    He always described Hawtrey as the life of the school, the man to whom  Eton owed more than to any of her sons during the century. Though not  his pupil, it was from him that Gladstone, when in the fourth form,  received for the first time incentives to exertion. 'It was entirely due  to Hawtrey,' he records in a fragment, 'that I first owed the reception  of a spark, the _divinae particulam aurae_, and conceived a dim idea,  that in some time, manner, and degree, I might come to know. Even then,  as I had really no instructor, my efforts at Eton, down to 1827, were  perhaps of the purest plodding ever known.'    Evidently he was not a boy of special mark during the first three years  at Eaton. In the evening he played chess and cards, and usually lost. He  claimed in after life that he had once taken a drive in a hired tandem,  but Etonians who knew him as a schoolboy decided that an aspiring memory  here made him boast of crimes that were not his. He was assiduous in the  Eton practice of working a small boat, whether skiff, funny, or wherry,  single-handed. In the masquerade of Montem he figured complacently in  all the glories of the costume of a Greek patriot, for he was a faithful  Canningite; the heroic struggle against the Turk was at its fiercest,  and it was the year when Byron died at Missolonghi. Of Montem as an  institution he thought extremely ill, 'the whole thing a wretched waste  of time and money, a most ingenious contrivance to exhibit us as  baboons, a bore in the full sense of the word.' He did not stand aside  from the harmless gaieties of boyish life, but he rigidly refused any  part in boyish indecorums. He was, in short, just the diligent,  cheerful, healthy-minded schoolboy that any good father would have his  son to be. He enjoys himself with his brother at the Christopher, and is  glad to record that 'Keate did not make any jaw about being so late.'  Half a dozen of them met every whole holiday or half, and went up Salt  Hill to bully the fat waiter, eat toasted cheese, and drink egg-wine.                                 SCHOOL DAYS    He started, as we have already seen, in middle fourth form. In the  spring of 1822 Hawtrey said to him: 'Continue to do as well as this, and  I will send you up for good again before the fourth of June.' Before the  end of June, he tells his sailor brother of his success: 'It far exceeds  the most sanguine expectations I ever entertained. I have got into the  remove between the fourth and fifth forms. I have been sent up for good  a second time, and have taken seven places.' In the summer of 1823 he  announces that he has got into the fifth form after taking sixteen  places, and here instead "]]]
