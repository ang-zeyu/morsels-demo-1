Screens of some sort are marked as crossing both  aisles, as a continuation of the western face of this organ-gallery: or  perhaps these were only metal gates. The design of the whole seems to  have been very poor: \"the miserable organ gallery\" is what Hewett calls  it. The original stone screen that formed the entrance to the choir  before the tower fell, situated in the bay of the nave next to the  octagon, was still standing. It had served as the organ-loft until the  alteration. Browne Willis, who wrote before Bishop Mawson came to Ely,  records that the choir had been paved with black and white marble at the  charge of Bishop Gunning, and that he had proposed to move the choir to  the east end nearly a hundred years before it was actually done, \"which  if he had done ... it would have added vastly to the Beauty of the  Church.\"[25]    Still later in the century, in 1796, Wyatt \"the destructive\" was  directed to make a report on the state of the fabric, and to supply  estimates for a restoration. Among other things he recommended the  selling of the lead on the roof, the removal of the rood-loft, and the  reducing of the number of bells from five to one.    The nineteenth century began with works of destruction. In 1801[26] the  spire on the tower was taken down. Soon afterwards, in accordance with  Wyatt's recommendation, the ancient rood-loft in the nave was removed.  As it had ceased to be the entrance to the choir, it was probably deemed  useless. The roof of the galilee was also removed, and the lancets at  the west of the cathedral blocked up. Mr. Bernasconi's contract, in  1801, for the repair of part of the west end, amounting to L232 14_s._  6_d._,[27] probably covered the whole of this. A note on the receipt  speaks of a picture at the east end in 1800, a pulpit in 1806, and a new  window in 1808; but whether all these were new or merely repaired does  not appear. From Goodwin's \"Ely Gossip\" we learn that the upper part of  the doorway of the galilee porch was \"renewed in plaster.\" In a pamphlet  published in 1827 it is said that \"so much has been done to this  cathedral of late as to afford a reasonable ground of hope, that ere  long the beautiful Purbeck shafts will be cleared of the yellow ochre  which coats and defiles them, and that the earth will be cleared away  from the walls on the north side, where at present it is injuring both  walls and pavement.\"[28] What had then been recently done, and thus  mentioned, apparently with approval, did not long satisfy the public  taste, although a large outlay testified to the good intentions, if not  the judgment, of the authorities. Walsingham's stalls were painted; and  the nave, octagon, lantern, and transepts were colour-washed. Within  about twenty-five years what had been introduced as embellishments were  removed as disfigurements, and the removal cost possibly as much as the  introduction.    [Illustration: ELY CATHEDRAL AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.                _From Stevenson's Supplement to Bentham._]    Soon after Dean Peacock came to Ely he commenced the restoration and  decoration of the fabric which have gone on continuously to the present  time, and are not yet complete. Besides many munificent gifts, of which  the cost is not known, upwards of L70,000 has been expended upon the  works at the cathedral since 1843. The first great work included in this  sum was the entire re-leading of the roof. In 1842 there had been a fire  discovered in the roof near the west tower, but no great damage was  done. Most likely it was the prospect of having to spend large sums upon  the cathedral itself that induced the dean and chapter to sanction the  demolition of the sextry-barn, \"on the ground that the repairs it  required were too expensive.\" This barn was situated to the north of the  lady-chapel. It was an object of the greatest architectural interest,  and its destruction is much to be lamented. It was of Early English  date, and is said to have been a \"noble and almost unrivalled\" building.  It seems to have been of the same character as the abbey tithe-barn at  Peterborough, which was perfect a very few years ago, and of which the  whole of the wooden posts and beams are still to be seen _in situ_. The  Peterborough barn was also of thirteenth century date; it had aisles and  nave all formed by the oak beams and supports. The Ely barn was much  smaller.    In July, 1845, the restoration had been well begun, and was being  carried on with energy. The works in Bishop Alcock's chapel had been  commenced. The south end of the west transept, hitherto used as a kind  of storehouse or lumber-room, was repaired and thrown open to the  church. A poor deal roof was added as a temporary protection. The choir  roof was scraped and cleaned. In the lady-chapel the colour-wash that  had obscured the remains of the beautiful carvings was removed. The west  tower was ceiled. Up to this time there appears to have been no properly  qualified architect in charge of the work. In 1847 Mr. Scott (afterwards  Sir G. G. Scott) was appointed architect to the cathedral. He soon made  an extensive examination of the whole building, and issued a report upon  the state of the fabric and the amount of restoration needful.    Dean Peacock, who so thoroughly identified himself with the restoration,  died in 1858. His successor, Dean Goodwin, entered with enthusiasm upon  the work, and was instrumental in raising large sums of money for the  carrying out of the architect's designs. After he had been dean seven  years he published a paper upon the progress that had been made, which  commences with these words: \"The time seems to be now come, when the  completion of the great work of restoration, commenced under Dean  Peacock, and guided for many years by his care and judgment, may be  looked upon as within reach.\"[29] In this paper he enumerated these  works as already accomplished:    1. The choir restored and rearranged.    2. Central lantern restored (Peacock Memorial).    3. South-east transept restored.    4. South-west transept restored.    5. Roof of north transept restored and painted.    6. Nave ceiled and painted.    7. Nave roof repaired and re-leaded.    8. S. Catherine's chapel rebuilt.    9. Bishop Alcock's chapel restored.    10. Galilee porch re-paved.    11. Western tower opened, ceiled, re-roofed, strengthened, etc.    12. About seventy windows filled with stained glass.    Of the painting the north transept roof the expense was borne by the  tradesmen employed upon the cathedral. The restoration of Bishop  Alcock's chapel was undertaken, out of respect to the memory of their  founder, by Jesus College, Cambridge. The painting of the nave ceiling  was the work of Mr. le Strange and Mr. Gambier Parry, the former of whom  also painted the ceiling of the west tower. Exclusive of special  donations for specific works included in the above list, the dean  reckoned that up to the time of his report L27,185 had been spent, of  which the dean and chapter had contributed no less than L15,200. Several  individual members of the chapter had, besides money gifts, presented  windows or other decorations, or had been responsible for various  structural repairs. At a rough estimate the total sum expended had  amounted to L40,000. The works still to be executed were these:    1. Paving the nave, octagon, and transepts.    2. Completion of pinnacles and parapet of octagon.    3. Internal decoration of lantern.    4. Repair of galilee.    There would also be much to be done in the matter of properly warming  and lighting the cathedral; but those expenses were more strictly within  the ordinary obligations of the dean and chapter.    The only one of the above works that calls for special notice is the  restoration of the octagon and lantern. In a statement circulated by the  dean and chapter in 1853 it was declared that \"of all works which remain  to be undertaken, the most considerable and the most important is the  restoration of the lantern, including the decoration of the vault, the  substitution of windows of an appropriate character for those which now  disfigure it so seriously, and the addition of the outer corona of  turrets and pinnacles as originally designed by Alan de Walsingham.\" But  nothing was done towards this during Dean Peacock's lifetime. In the  summer before his death he had described more particularly the  disfigurements and the mutilations which the lantern had undergone; and  he further pointed out the unsafe condition of the exterior. The upper  windows of the octagon were of the \"meanest description of carpenter's  Gothic\"; they had been reduced from four to three lights each; they had  been shortened more than three feet (probably by Essex in the eighteenth  century); the upper timbers were in a ruinous state, and incapable of  being used again. The original design provided for eight lofty turrets  at the angles of the greater octagon and four pinnacles in the middle of  its longer sides. At the first meeting of the chapter after Dean  Peacock's death it was resolved that no memorial of him would be so  appropriate as the restoration of the lantern, and Mr. Scott was  instructed to prepare designs at once. A tentative sketch of his design  was published in October, 1859; and the opinion of experts was invited.  Mr. Scott's report, dated June 10, 1859, gave the result of his careful  examination. He concluded that the wooden lantern was originally \"to a  certain extent an imitation of the general form of the _stone octagon_  below it. Each had large windows of four lights below, with circular  panels in the spandrils; each had a distinct story over these windows,  lighted by smaller windows consisting of several detached lights, and  each had considerable turrets, probably surmounted by pinnacles at the  angles, and, in all probability, open parapets between them.\"[30] He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#8)"],[1,"nights the birds fly lower,  as may be known by the clearer sounds of their calls as they pass over;  at times one may even hear the flutter of their wings.  There is a {68}  good reason for their travelling at this time, as they need the  daylight for gathering food.    There appear to be certain popular pathways of migration along which  many, though by no means all, of the aerial voyageurs wing their way.  As to the distribution of these avian highways, we know at least that  the coastlines of the continents are favourite routes.  Longfellow, in  the valley of the Charles, lived beneath one of these arteries of  migration, and on still autumn nights often listened to the voices of  the migrating hosts, \"falling dreamily through the sky.\"    A small number of the species migrate by day; among these are the  Hawks, Swallows, Ducks, and Geese.  The last two groups also travel by  night.  The rate at which they proceed on their journey is not as great  as was formerly supposed.  From twenty to thirty miles an hour is the  speed generally taken, and perhaps fifty miles an hour is the greatest  rapidity attained.  Flights are usually not long sustained, a hundred  and fifty miles a day being above the {69} average.  Individuals will  at times pause and remain for a few days in a favourable locality  before proceeding farther.  When large bodies of water are encountered  longer flights are of course necessary, for land birds cannot rest on  the water as their feathers would soon become water-soaked and drowning  would result.  Multitudes of small birds, including even the little  Ruby-throated Hummingbird, annually cross the Gulf of Mexico at a  single flight.  This necessitates a continuous journey of from five  hundred to seven hundred miles.  Some North American birds migrate  southward only a few hundred miles to pass the winter, while many  others go from Canada and the United States to Mexico, Central and  South America.    The ponds and sloughs of all that vast country lying between the Great  Lakes and Hudson Bay on the east and the mountains of the Far West,  constitute the principal nursery of North American waterfowl, whence,  in autumn, come the flocks of Ducks and Geese that in winter darken the  Southern {70} sounds and lakes.  One stream moves down the Pacific  Coast, another follows the Mississippi Valley to the marshes of  Louisiana and Texas, while a third passes diagonally across the country  in a southeasterly direction until it reaches the Maryland and Virginia  coastline.  Thence the birds disperse along the coastal country from  Maine to Florida.    [Illustration: Migration Routes of Some North American Birds]    _The Travelling Shore Birds._--Turnstones, Sanderlings, Curlews, and  other denizens of the beaches and salt marshes migrate in great numbers  along our Atlantic Coast.  Some of them winter in the United States,  and others pass on to the West Indies and southward.  The extent of the  annual journeys undertaken by some of these birds is indeed marvellous.  Admiral Peary has told me that he found shore birds on the most  northern land, where it slopes down into the Arctic Sea, less than five  hundred miles from the North Pole; and these same birds pass the winter  seven thousand miles south of their summer home.  One of these  wonderful migrants is the Golden Plover.  In autumn the birds leave  {72} eastern North America at Nova Scotia, striking out boldly across  the Atlantic Ocean, and they may not again sight land until they reach  the West Indies or the northern coast of South America.  Travelling, as  they do, in a straight line, they ordinarily pass eastward of the  Bermuda Islands.  Upon reaching South America, after a flight of two  thousand four hundred miles across the sea, they move on down to  Argentina and northern Patagonia.  In spring they return by an entirely  different route.  Passing up through western South America, and  crossing the Gulf of Mexico, these marvellous travellers follow up the  Mississippi Valley to their breeding grounds on the shores of the  Arctic Ocean.  Their main lines of spring and fall migration are  separated by as much as two thousand miles.  During the course of the  year the Golden Plover takes a flight of sixteen thousand miles.    _The World's Migrating Champion._--The bird which makes the longest  flight, according to the late Wells W. Cooke, America's greatest  authority on bird migration, is the Arctic Tern.  Professor Cooke, to  {73} whom we owe so much of our knowledge of the subject, says of this  bird:    \"It deserves its title of 'arctic' for it nests as far North as land  has been discovered; that is, as far North as the bird can find  anything stable on which to construct its nest.  Indeed, so arctic are  the conditions under which it breeds that the first nest found by man  in this region, only seven and one-half degrees from the pole,  contained a downy chick surrounded by a wall of newly fallen snow that  had been scooped out of the nest by the parent.  When the young are  full grown the entire family leaves the Arctic, and several months  later they are found skirting the edge of the Antarctic continent.    \"What their track is over that eleven thousand miles of intervening  space no one knows.  A few scattered individuals have been noted along  the United States coast south to Long Island, but the great flocks of  thousands and thousands of these Terns which range from pole to pole  have never been noted by ornithologists competent to indicate their  {74} preferred route and their time schedule.  The Arctic Terns arrive  in the Far North about June fifteenth and leave about August  twenty-fifth, thus staying fourteen weeks at the nesting site.  They  probably spend a few weeks longer in the winter than in the summer  home, and this would leave them scarcely twenty weeks for the round  trip of twenty-two thousand miles.  Not less than one hundred and fifty  miles in a straight line must be their daily task, and this is  undoubtedly multiplied several times by their zigzag twistings and  turnings in pursuit of food.    \"The Arctic Tern has more hours of daylight and sunlight than any other  animal on the globe.  At the most northern nesting site the midnight  sun has already appeared before the birds' arrival, and it never sets  during their entire stay at the breeding grounds.  During two months of  their sojourn in the Antarctic the birds do not see a sunset, and for  the rest of the time the sun dips only a little way below the horizon  and broad daylight is continuous.  The birds, therefore, have  twenty-four hours of daylight for at least {75} eight months in the  year, and during the other four months have considerably more daylight  than darkness.\"    _Perils of Migration._--The periods of migration are fraught with  numerous perils for the travelling hosts.  Attracted and blinded by the  torches of lighthouses, multitudes of birds are annually killed by  striking against lighthouse towers in thick, foggy weather.  The keeper  of the Cape Hatteras light once showed me a chipped place in the lens  which he said had been made by the bill of a great white Gannet which  one thick night crashed through the outer protecting glass of the  lighthouse lamp.  As many as seven hundred birds in one month have  killed themselves by flying against the Bartholdi Statue of Liberty in  New York Harbour.  As its torch is no longer lighted the death-rate  here has been greatly reduced, although some birds are still killed by  flying against the statue.  Many were formerly killed by striking the  Washington Monument, the record for one night being one hundred and  fifty dead birds.    {76}    Locomotive engineers have stated that in foggy weather birds often hurl  themselves against the headlight and frequently their bodies are later  picked up from the engine platform beneath.  Birds seem rarely to lose  their sense of direction, and they pursue their way for hundreds of  miles across the trackless ocean.  Terns, Gulls, and Murres are known  to go many miles in quest of food for their young and return through  dense fogs with unerring directness to their nests.    [Illustration: Lighthouses Cause the Death of Many Birds]    During the spring it is not uncommon for strange waterfowl to be found  helpless in the streets or fields of a region in which they are  ordinarily unknown.  These birds have become exhausted during the storm  of the night before, or have been injured by striking telephone or  telegraph wires, an accident which often happens.  Once I picked up a  Loon after a stormy night.  Apparently it had recovered its strength  after a few hours' rest, but, as this bird can rise on the wing only  from a body of water, over the surface of which it can paddle and flap  for many rods, and as {78} there was no pond or lake in all the  neighbouring country, the Loon's fate was evident from the first.    Birds are often swept to sea by storm winds from off shore.  Vainly  they beat against the gale or fly on quivering wings before its blast,  until the hungry waves swallow their weary bodies.  One morning in  northern Lake Michigan I found a Connecticut Warbler lying dead on the  deck beneath my stateroom window after a stormy night of wind and rain.  Overtaken many miles from shore, this little waif had been able to  reach the steamer on the deck of which it had fallen exhausted and  died.  What of its companions of the night before?    On May 3, 1915, I was on a ship two hundred miles off Brunswick,  Georgia.  That day the following birds came aboard, all in an exhausted  condition: Brown Creeper, Spotted Sandpiper, Green Heron, and  Yellow-billed Cuckoo.  We also encountered three flocks of Bobolinks,  which for some distance flew beside the ship.  They appeared to be  lost, for they all left us finally, flying straight ahead of the ship,  {79} which was bound South, yet birds were supposed to be going North  at this season.  I "]]]
