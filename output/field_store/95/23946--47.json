And now as they sweep round and round over the edge of a shoal, one of  the little fellows sees a fish and drops lower to follow it. The mother  sees it too; notes that the fish is slanting up to the surface, and  wisely lets the young fisherman alone. He is too near the water now; the  glare and the dancing waves bother him; he loses his gleam of silver in  the flash of a whitecap. Mother bird mounts higher, and whistles him up  where he can see better. But there is the fish again, and the youngster,  hungry and heedless, sets his wings for a swoop. _Chip, chip!_ \"wait,  he's going down,\" cautions the mother; but the little fellow, too  hungry to wait, shoots down like an arrow. He is a yard above the  surface when a big whitecap jumps up at him and frightens him. He  hesitates, swerves, flaps lustily to save himself. Then under the  whitecap is a gleam of silver again. Down he goes on the instant,--_ugh!  boo!_--like a boy taking his first dive. He is out of sight for a full  moment, while two waves race over him, and I hold my breath waiting for  him to come up. Then he bursts out, sputtering and shaking himself, and  of course without his fish.    As he rises heavily the mother, who has been circling over him whistling  advice and comfort, stops short with a single blow of her pinions  against the air. She has seen the same fish, watched him shoot away  under the plunge of her little one, and now sees him glancing up to the  edge of the shoal where the minnows are playing. She knows that the  young pupils are growing discouraged, and that the time has come to  hearten them. _Chip, chip!_--\"watch, I'll show you,\" she  whistles--_Cheeeep!_ with a sharp up-slide at the end, which I soon grow  to recognize as the signal to strike. At the cry she sets her wings and  shoots downward with strong, even plunge, strikes a wave squarely as it  rises, passes under it, and is out on the other side gripping a big  chub. The little ones follow her, whistling their delight, and  telling her that perhaps now they will go back to the nest and take a  look at the fish before they go on with their fishing. Which means, of  course, that they will eat it and go to sleep perfectly satisfied with  the good fun of fishing; and then lessons are over for the day.    [Illustration: \"GRIPPING HIS FISH AND _PIP-PIPPING_ HIS EXULTATION\"]    The mother, however, has other thoughts in her wise head. She knows that  the little ones are not yet tired, only hungry; and that there is much  to teach them before the chub stop shoaling and fishhawks must be off to  the coast. She knows also that they have thus far missed the two things  she brought them out to learn: to take a fish always as he comes up; and  to hit a wave always on the front side, under the crest. Gripping her  fish tightly, she bends in her slow flight and paralyzes it by a single  blow in the spine from her hooked beak. Then she drops it back into the  whitecaps, where, jumping to the top of my rock, I can see it  occasionally struggling near the surface.    _Cheeeep!_ \"try it now,\" she whistles.    _Pip, pip!_ \"here goes!\" cries the little one who failed before; and  down he drops, _souse!_ going clear under in his impatient hunger,  forgetting precept and example and past experience.    Again the waves race over him; but there is a satisfied note in the  mother's whistle which tells me that she sees him, and that he is doing  well. In a moment he is out again with a great rush and sputter,  gripping his fish and _pip-pipping_ his exultation. Away he goes in low  heavy flight to the nest. The mother circles over him a moment to be  sure he is not overloaded; then she goes back with the other neophyte  and ranges back and forth over the shoal's edge.    It is clear now to even my eyes that there is a vast difference in the  characters of young fishhawks. The first was eager, headstrong,  impatient; the second is calmer, stronger, more obedient. He watches the  mother; he heeds her signals. Five minutes later he makes a clean,  beautiful swoop and comes up with his fish. The mother whistles her  praise as she drops beside him. My eyes follow them as, gossiping like  two old cronies, they wing their slow way over the dancing whitecaps and  climb the slanting tree-tops to the nest.    The day's lessons are over now, and I go back to my bait-catching with a  new admiration for these winged members of the brotherhood. Perhaps  there is also a bit of envy or regret in my meditation as I tie on a new  hook to replace the one that an uneasy eel is trying to rid himself of,  down in the mud. If I had only had some one to teach me like that, I  should certainly now be a better fisherman.    Next day, when the mother came up the lake to the shoal with her two  little ones, there was a surprise awaiting them. For half an hour I had  been watching from the point to anticipate their coming. There were some  things that puzzled me, and that puzzle me still, in Ismaques' fishing.  If he caught his fish in his mouth, after the methods of loon and otter,  I could understand it better. But to catch a fish--whose dart is like  lightning--under the water with his feet, when, after his plunge, he can  see neither his fish nor his feet, must require some puzzling  calculation. And I had set a trap in my head to find out how it is done.    When the fishermen hove into sight, and their eager pipings came faintly  up the lake ahead of them, I paddled hastily out and turned loose a  half-dozen chub in the shallow water. I had kept them alive as long as  possible in a big pail, and they still had life enough to fin about near  the surface. When the fishermen arrived I was sitting among the rocks as  usual, and turned to acknowledge the mother bird's _Ch'wee?_ But my  deep-laid scheme to find out their method accomplished nothing; except,  perhaps, to spoil the day's lesson. They saw my bait on the instant. One  of the youngsters dove headlong without poising, went under, missed his  fish, rose, plunged again. He got him that time and went away  sputtering. The second took his time, came down on a long swift slant,  and got his fish without going under. Almost before the lesson began it  was over. The mother circled about for a few moments in a puzzled sort  of way, watching the young fishermen flapping up the slope to their  nest. Something was wrong. She had fished enough to know that success  means something more than good luck; and this morning success had come  too easily. She wheeled slowly over the shallows, noting the fish there,  where they plainly did not belong, and dropping to examine with  suspicion one big chub that was floating, belly up, on the water. Then  she went under with a rush, where I could not see, came out again with a  fish for herself, and followed her little ones to the nest.    Next day I set the trap again in the same way. But the mother, with her  lesson well laid out before her, remembered yesterday's unearned success  and came over to investigate, leaving her young ones circling along the  farther shore. There were the fish again, in shallow water; and  there--too easy altogether!--were two dead ones floating among the  whitecaps. She wheeled away in a sharp turn, as if she had not seen  anything, whistled her pupils up to her, and went on to other fishing  grounds.    Presently, above the next point, I heard their pipings and the sharp,  up-sliding _Cheeeep!_ which was the mother's signal to swoop. Paddling  up under the point in my canoe, I found them all wheeling and diving  over a shoal, where I knew the fish were smaller and more nimble, and  where there were lily pads for a haven of refuge, whither no hawk could  follow them. Twenty times I saw them swoop only to miss, while the  mother circled above or beside them, whistling advice and encouragement.  And when at last they struck their fish and bore away towards the  mountain, there was an exultation in their lusty wing beats, and in the  whistling cry they sent back to me, which was not there the day before.    The mother followed them at a distance, veering in when near my shoal to  take another look at the fish there. Three were floating now instead of  two; the others--what were left of them--struggled feebly at the  surface. _Chip, ch'weee!_ she whistled disdainfully; \"plenty fish here,  but mighty poor fishing.\" Then she swooped, passed under, came out with  a big chub, and was gone, leaving me only a blinding splash and a  widening circle of laughing, dancing, tantalizing wavelets to tell me  how she catches them.          When You Meet a Bear      There are always two surprises when you meet a bear. You have one, and  he has the other. On your tramps and camps in the big woods you may be  on the lookout for Mooween; you may be eager and even anxious to meet  him; but when you double the point or push into the blueberry patch and,  suddenly, there he is, blocking the path ahead, looking intently into  your eyes to fathom at a glance your intentions, then, I fancy, the  experience is like that of people who have the inquisitive habit of  looking under their beds nightly for a burglar, and at last find him  there, stowed away snugly, just where they always expected him to be.    Mooween, on his part, is always looking for you when once he has learned  that you have moved into his woods. But not from any desire to see you!  He is like a lazy man looking for work, and hoping devoutly that he may  not find it. A bear has very little curiosity--less than any other of  the wood folk. He loves to be alone; and so, when he goes hunting for  you, to find out just where you are, it is always with the creditable  desire to leave you in as large a room as possible, while he himself  goes quietly away into deeper solitudes. As this desire of his is much  stronger than your mere idle curiosity to see something new, you rarely  see Mooween even where he is most at home. And that is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#8)"],[1,",  with no complication of perspective. They should have no undulations of  surface. That is to say, the margins of all the features should be as  nearly as possible the original surface of the wood, which may have just  the least possible bit of finish in the manner I shall describe later  on. The articulation of the leaves and flower is represented by simple  gouge cuts. There should be nothing in the design requiring rounded  surfaces. The passage for tools in clearing out the ground between the  features must not be less than 1/4 in.; this will allow the 3/16 in.  corner grounder to pass freely backward and forward. The ground is  supposed to be sunk about three-sixteenths of an inch.    As you have not got your design made, I shall, for convenience' sake,  explain how Fig. 13 should be begun and finished. First having traced  the full-size design it should be transferred to the wood by means of a  piece of blue carbon paper.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    Then with either the Veiner or V tool outline the whole of the leaves,  etc., about 1/8 in. deep, keeping well on the outside of the drawing.  Ignore all minor detail for the present, blocking out the design in  masses. No outline need be grooved for the margin of the panel at  present, as it should be done with a larger tool. For this purpose take  gouge No. 6 (1/4 in. wide), and begin at the left-hand bottom corner of  the panel, cut a groove about 1/16 in. within the blue line, taking care  not to cut off parts of the leaves in the process; begin a little above  the corner at the bottom, and leave off a little below that at the top.  The miters will be formed later on.    In this operation, as in all subsequent ones, the grain of the wood will  be more or less in evidence. You will by degrees get to know the piece  of wood you are working upon, and cut in such a way that your tool runs  _with_ the grain and not _against_ it; that is to say, you will cut as  much as possible on the up-hill direction of the fiber. This can not  always be done in deep hollows, but then you will have had some practise  before you attempt these.    Now take chisel No. 11, and with it stab into the grooved outline,  pressing the tool down perpendicularly to what you think feels like the  depth of the ground. The mallet need not be used for this, as the wood  is soft enough to allow of the tools being pressed by the hand alone,  but remember that the force must be proportioned to the depth desired,  and to the direction of the grain; much less pressure is wanted to drive  a tool into the wood when its edge is parallel with the grain than when  it lies in a cross direction; small tools penetrate more easily than  large ones, as a matter of course, but one must think of these things or  accidents happen.    When you have been all round the design in this way with such gouges as  may be needed for the slow and quick curves, get the wood out nearly  down to the ground, leaving a little for finishing. Do this with any  tool that fits the spaces best; the larger the better. Cut across the  grain as much as possible, not along it. The flat gouge, No. 1, will be  found useful for this purpose in the larger spaces, and the grounders  for the narrow passages. This leaves the ground in a rough state, which  must be finished later on.    Now take gouges Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and chisels Nos. 10, 11, 12, and  with them cut down the outline as accurately as possible to the depth of  the ground, and, if you are lucky, just a hair's breadth deeper. In  doing this make the sides slope a little outward toward the bottom. If  the gouges do not entirely adapt themselves to the contours of your  lines, do not trouble, but leave that bit to be done afterward with a  sweep of the tool, either a flat gouge, or the corner-chisel used like a  knife.    Now we have all the outline cut down to the depth of the background, and  may proceed to clear out the wood hanging about between the design and  the ground all round it. We shall do this with the \"grounders,\" using  the largest one when possible, and only taking to the smallest when  absolutely necessary on account of space. This done, we shall now  proceed to finish the hollow sides of the panel and make the miters.  Again, take No. 6 gouge and drive a clear hollow touching the blue line  at end of panel, and reaching the bottom of the sinking, i.e., the  actual ground as finished, see _a_, Fig. 15. To form the miter at top of  left-hand side of panel, carry the hollow on until the tool reaches the  bottom of the hollow running along the top; as soon as this point is  gained, turn the tool out and pitch it a little up in the way shown at  _c_, Fig. 15, in which the tool is shown at an angle which brings the  edge of the gouge exactly on the line of the miter to be formed.  Beginning as it does at _b_, this quick turn of the handle to the left  takes out the little bit of wood shown by dotted lines at _b_, and  forms one-half of the miter. The cross-grain cut should be done first,  as in this way there is less risk of splintering. Now repeat the process  on the long-grain side of the panel, and one miter is in a good way for  being finished.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    A word now about these sides of sunk panels. They always look better if  they are hollowed with a gouge instead of being cut square down. In the  first case they carry out the impression that the whole thing is cut out  of a solid piece of wood, whereas when they are cut sharply down they  always suggest cabinet-making, as if a piece had been glued on to form a  margin.    We have now got the work blocked out and the ground fairly level, and we  are ready to do the little carving we have allowed ourselves. Before we  begin this I shall take the opportunity of reminding you that you must  be very careful in handling your tools; it is a matter of the greatest  importance, if the contingency of cut fingers or damaged work is to be  avoided. The left hand in carving has nearly as much to do as the right,  only in a different way. Grasp the chisel or gouge in the left hand  with the fingers somewhat extended, that is, the little finger will come  well on to the blade, and the thumb run up toward the top of the handle;  the wrist meanwhile resting on the work. The right hand is used for  pushing the tool forward, and for turning it this way and that, in fact  does most of the guiding. Both hands may be described as opposing each  other in force, for the pressure on the tool from the right hand should  be resisted by the left, until almost a balance is struck, and just  enough force left to cut the wood gently, without danger of slipping  forward and damaging it or the fingers. The tool is thus in complete  command, and the slightest change of pressure on either hand may alter  its direction or stop it altogether. Never drive a tool forward with one  hand without this counter-resistance, as there is no knowing what may  happen if it slips. Never wave tools about in the hand, and generally  remember that they are dangerous implements, both to the user and the  work. Never put too much force on a tool when in the neighborhood of a  delicate passage, but take time and eat the bit of wood out mouse-like,  in small fragments.    Now we are ready to finish our panel. Take the grounders, according to  the size required, always using the biggest possible. Keep the tool well  pressed down, and _shave_ away the roughness of the ground, giving the  tool a slight sideway motion as well as a forward one. Work right up to  the leaves, etc., which, if cut deep enough, should allow the chips to  come away freely, leaving a clear line of intersection; if it does not,  then the upright sides must be cut down until the ground is quite clear  of chips. Grounder tools are very prone to dig into the surface and make  work for themselves: sharp tools, practise, and a slight sideway motion  will prevent this. Tool No. 23 is useful in this respect, its corners  being slightly lifted above the level of the ground as it passes along.  Corners that can not be reached with the bent chisels may be finished  off with the corner-chisel.    Now we come to the surface decorations, for the carving in this design  consists of little more. This is all done with the gouges. Generally  speaking, enter the groove at its widest end and leave it at the  narrowest, lowering the handle of the tool gradually as you go along to  lift the gouge out of the wood, producing the drawing of the forms at  the same time. A gouge cut never looks so well as when done at one  stroke; patching it afterward with amendments always produces a labored  look. If this has to be done, the tool should be passed finally over the  whole groove to remove the superfluous tool marks--a sideway gliding  motion of the edge, combined with its forward motion, often succeeds in  this operation. To form the circular center of the flower, press down  gouge Nos. 5 or 6, gently at first and perpendicular to the wood. When a  cut has been made all round the circle, work the edge of the tool in it,  circus-like, by turning the handle in the fingers round and round until  the edge cuts its way down to the proper depth. (See A, Fig. 15.)    Carve the sides of the leaves where necessary with flat gouges on the  inside curves, and with chisels and corner-chisels on the outside ones.  These should be used in a sliding or knife-like fashion, and not merely  pushed forward. Finish the surface in the same manner all over between  the gouge grooves and the edges of the leaves, producing a very slight  bevel as in section _a_, Fig. 13, and this panel may be called finished.    Fig. 14 is another suggestion for a design, upon which I hope you will  base one of your own as an exercise at this stage of your progress.    Before we begin another, though, I shall take this opportunity of  reading you a short lecture on a most important matter which has a"]]]
