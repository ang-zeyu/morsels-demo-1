[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#8)"],[1," to help you! Oh, please,  grandfather, do something to help her! I know you can.\"    Heidi had been clinging to her grandfather and looking up to him with  trusting eyes. At last he said, glancing down: \"All right, child,  we'll see that it won't rattle any more. We can do it tomorrow.\"    Heidi was so overjoyed at these words that she danced around the room  shouting: \"We'll do it tomorrow! We can do it tomorrow!\"    The grandfather, keeping his word, took Heidi down the following day  with the same instructions as before. After Heidi had disappeared, he  went around the house inspecting it.    The grandmother, in her joy at seeing the child again, had stopped the  wheel and called: \"Here is the child again! She has come again!\"  Heidi, grasping her outstretched hands, sat herself on a low stool at  the old woman's feet and began to chat. Suddenly violent blows were  heard outside; the grandmother in her fright nearly upset the  spinning-wheel and screamed: \"Oh, God, it has come at last. The hut is  tumbling down!\"    \"Grandmother, don't be frightened,\" said the child, while she put her  arms around her. \"Grandfather is just fastening the shutter and fixing  everything for you.\"    \"Is it possible? Has God not forgotten us after all? Brigida, have you  heard it? Surely that is a hammer. Ask him to come in a moment, if it  is he, for I must thank him.\"    When Brigida went out, she found the old man busy with putting a new  beam along the wall. Approaching him, she said: \"Mother and I wish you  a good-afternoon. We are very much obliged to you for doing us such a  service, and mother would like to see you. There are few that would  have done it, uncle, and how can we thank you?\"    \"That will do,\" he interrupted. \"I know what your opinion about me is.  Go in, for I can find what needs mending myself.\"    Brigida obeyed, for the uncle had a way that nobody could oppose. All  afternoon the uncle hammered around; he even climbed up on the roof,  where much was missing. At last he had to stop, for the last nail was  gone from his pocket. The darkness had come in the meantime, and  Heidi was ready to go up with him, packed warmly in his arms.    Thus the winter passed. Sunshine had come again into the blind woman's  life, and made her days less dark and dreary. Early every morning she  would begin to listen for Heidi's footsteps, and when the door was  opened and the child ran in, the grandmother exclaimed every time more  joyfully: \"Thank God, she has come again!\"    Heidi would talk about her life, and make the grandmother smile and  laugh, and in that way the hours flew by. In former times the old  woman had always sighed: \"Brigida, is the day not over yet?\" but now  she always exclaimed after Heidi's departure: \"How quickly the  afternoon has gone by. Don't you think so, too, Brigida?\" Her daughter  had to assent, for Heidi had long ago won her heart. \"If only God will  spare us the child!\" the grandmother would often say. \"I hope the  uncle will always be kind, as he is now.\"--\"Does Heidi look well,  Brigida?\" was a frequent question, which always got a reassuring  answer.    Heidi also became very fond of the old grandmother, and when the  weather was fair, she visited her every day that winter. Whenever the  child remembered that the grandmother was blind, she would get very  sad; her only comfort was that her coming brought such happiness. The  grandfather soon had mended the cottage; often he would take down big  loads of timber, which he used to good purpose. The grandmother vowed  that no rattling could be heard any more, and that, thanks to the  uncle's kindness, she slept better that winter than she had done for  many a year.    [Illustration]          V    TWO VISITORS      Two winters had nearly passed. Heidi was happy, for the spring was  coming again, with the soft delicious wind that made the fir-trees  roar. Soon she would be able to go up to the pasture, where blue and  yellow flowers greeted her at every step. She was nearly eight years  old, and had learned to take care of the goats, who ran after her like  little dogs. Several times the village teacher had sent word by Peter  that the child was wanted in school, but the old man had not paid any  attention to the message and had kept her with him as before. It was a  beautiful morning in March. The snow had melted on the slopes, and was  going fast. Snowdrops were peeping through the ground, which seemed to  be getting ready for spring. Heidi was running to and fro before the  door, when she suddenly saw an old gentleman, dressed in black,  standing beside her. As she appeared frightened, he said kindly: \"You  must not be afraid of me, for I love children. Give me your hand,  Heidi, and tell me where your grandfather is.\"    \"He is inside, making round wooden spoons,\" the child replied, opening  the door while she spoke.    It was the old pastor of the village, who had known the grandfather  years ago. After entering, he approached the old man, saying:  \"Good-morning, neighbor.\"    The old man got up, surprised, and offering a seat to the visitor,  said: \"Good-morning, Mr. Parson. Here is a wooden chair, if it is good  enough.\"    Sitting down, the parson said: \"It is long since I have seen you,  neighbor. I have come to-day to talk over a matter with you. I am sure  you can guess what it is about.\"    The clergyman here looked at Heidi, who was standing near the door.    \"Heidi, run out to see the goats,\" said the grandfather, \"and bring  them some salt; you can stay till I come.\"    Heidi disappeared on the spot. \"The child should have come to school a  year ago,\" the parson went on to say. \"Didn't you get the teacher's  warning? What do you intend to do with the child?\"    \"I do not want her to go to school,\" said the old man, unrelentingly.    \"What do you want the child to be?\"    \"I want her to be free and happy as a bird!\"    \"But she is human, and it is high time for her to learn something. I  have come now to tell you about it, so that you can make your plans.  She must come to school next winter; remember that.\"    \"I shan't do it, pastor!\" was the reply.    \"Do you think there is no way?\" the clergyman replied, a little hotly.  \"You know the world, for you have travelled far. What little sense you  show!\"    \"You think I am going to send this delicate child to school in every  storm and weather!\" the old man said excitedly. \"It is a two hours'  walk, and I shall not let her go; for the wind often howls so that it  chokes me if I venture out. Did you know Adelheid, her mother? She was  a sleep-walker, and had fainting-fits. Nobody shall compel me to let  her go; I will gladly fight it out in court.\"    \"You are perfectly right,\" said the clergyman kindly. \"You could not  send her to school from here. Why don't you come down to live among us  again? You are leading a strange life here; I wonder how you can keep  the child warm in winter.\"    \"She has young blood and a good cover. I know where to find good wood,  and all winter I keep a fire going. I couldn't live in the village,  for the people there and I despise each other; we had better keep  apart.\"    \"You are mistaken, I assure you! Make your peace with God, and then  you'll see how happy you will be.\"    The clergyman had risen, and holding out his hand, he said cordially:  \"I shall count on you next winter, neighbor. We shall receive you  gladly, reconciled with God and man.\"    But the uncle replied firmly, while he shook his visitor by the hand:  \"Thank you for your kindness, but you will have to wait in vain.\"    \"God be with you,\" said the parson, and left him sadly.    The old man was out of humor that day, and when Heidi begged to go to  the grandmother, he only growled: \"Not to-day.\" Next day they had  hardly finished their dinner, when another visitor arrived. It was  Heidi's aunt Deta; she wore a hat with feathers and a dress with such  a train that it swept up everything that lay on the cottage floor.  While the uncle looked at her silently, Deta began to praise him and  the child's red cheeks. She told him that it had not been her  intention to leave Heidi with him long, for she knew she must be in  his way. She had tried to provide for the child elsewhere, and at  last she had found a splendid chance for her. Very rich relations of  her lady, who owned the largest house in Frankfurt, had a lame  daughter. This poor little girl was confined to her rolling-chair and  needed a companion at her lessons. Deta had heard from her lady that a  sweet, quaint child was wanted as playmate and schoolmate for the  invalid. She had gone to the housekeeper and told her all about Heidi.  The lady, delighted with the idea, had told her to fetch the child at  once. She had come now, and it was a lucky chance for Heidi, \"for one  never knew what might happen in such a case, and who could tell--\"    \"Have you finished?\" the old man interrupted her at last.    \"Why, one might think I was telling you the silliest things. There is  not a man in Praetiggan who would not thank God for such news.\"    \"Bring them to somebody else, but not to me,\" said the uncle, coldly.    Deta, flaming up, replied: \"Do you want to hear what I think? Don't I  know how old she is; eight years old and ignorant of everything. They  have told me that you refuse to send her to church and to school. She  is my only sister's child, and I shall not bear it, for I am  responsible. You do not care for her, how else could you be  indifferent to such luck. You had better give way or I shall get the  people to back me. If I were you, I would not have it brought to  court; some things might be warmed up that you would not care to hear  about.\"    \"Be quiet!\" the uncle thundered with flaming eyes. \"Take her and ruin  her, but do not bring her before my sight again. I do not want to see  her with feathers in her hat and wicked words like yours.\"    With long strides he went out.    \"You have made him angry!\" said Heidi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#8)"],[1,"Ft.  Worth, Texas, and landed in Henryetta, Texas, on the 14th day of  October 1883. Then, we had 65 miles to walk to Ft. Sill. We walked  there in three days. I was assigned to my Company, Troop G. 9th  Calvary, and we stayed and drilled in Ft. Sill six months, when we was  assigned to duty. We got orders to come to Ft. Reno, Okla., on the 6th  day of January 1885 where we was ordered to Stillwater, Okla., to move  five hundred immigrants under Capt. Couch. We landed there on the 23rd  day of January, Saturday evening, and Sunday was the 24th. We had  general inspection Monday, January 25, 1885. We fell in line of  battle, sixteen companies of soldiers, to move 500 immigrants to the  Arkansas City, Kansas line.    We formed a line at 9:00 o'clock Monday morning and Captain Couch run  up his white flag, and Colonel Hatch he sent the orderly up to see  what he meant by putting up the flag, so Captain Couch sent word back,  \"If you don't fire on me, I'll leave tomorrow.\" Colonel Hatch turned  around to the Major and told him to turn his troops back to the camp,  and detailed three camps of soldiers of the 8th Cavalry to carry  Captain Couch's troop of 500 immigrants to Arkansas City, Kansas.  Troop L., Troop D., and Troop B. taken them back with 43 wagons and  put them over the line of Kansas. Then we were ordered back to our  supply camp at Camp Alice, 9 miles north of Guthrie in the Cimarron  horseshoe bottom. We stayed there about three months, and Capt. Couch  and his colony came back into the territory at Caldwell, Kansas June  1885.    I laid there 'til August 8, then we changed regiments with the 5th  Calvary to go to Nebraska. There was a breakout with the Indians at  Ft. Reno the 1st of July 1885. The Indian Agency tried to make the  Indians wear citizens' clothes. They had to call General Sheridan  from Washington, D. C., to quiet the Indians down. Now, we had to make  a line in three divisions, fifteen miles a part, one non-commissioned  officer to each squad, and these men was to go to Caldwell, Kansas and  bring him to Ft. Reno that night. He came that night, so the next  morning Colonel Brisbane and General Hatch reported to General  Sheridan what the trouble was. General Sheridan called all the Indian  Chiefs together and asked them why they rebelled against the agency,  and they told them they weren't going to wear citizen's clothes.  General Sheridan called his corporals and sergeants together and told  them to go behind the guard house and dig a grave for this Indian  agent in order to fool the Indian Chiefs. Then, he sent a detachment  of soldiers to order the Indian Chiefs away from the guard house and  to put this Indian agent in the ambulance that brought him to Ft. Reno  and take him back to Washington, D. C., to remain there 'til he  returned. The next morning he called all the Indian Chiefs to the  guard house and pointed down to the grave and said that, \"I have  killed the agent and buried him there.\" The Indians tore the feathers  out of their hats rejoicing that they killed the agent.    On the 12th of the same July, we had general inspection with General  Foresides from Washington, then we was ordered back to our supply camp  to stay there 'til we got orders of our change. On August 8, we got  orders to change to go to Nebraska, to Ft. Robinson, Ft. Nibrary, and  Ft. McKinney, and we left on the 8th of August.    This is my Oklahoma history. I gave this story to the Daily Oklahoman  and Times at one time and they are supposed to publish it but they  haven't.    Now you see that tree up there in front of my house? That tree is 50  years old. It is called the potopic tree. That was the only tree  around here in 1882. This was a bald prairie. I enlisted over there  where the City Market sets now. That was our starting camp under Capt.  Payne, but he died.    I joined the A. M. E. Methodist Church in 1874. I love this song  better than all the rest:        \"Am I a Soldier of the Cross?\"    Abraham Lincoln was a smart man, but he would have done more if he was  not killed. I don't think his work was finished. I'll tell you the  truth about Booker T. Washington. He argued our people to stay out of  town and stay in the country. He was a Democrat. He was a smart man,  but I think a man should live wherever he choose regardless. I never  stopped work whenever I'd hear he was coming to town to speak. You  know they wasn't fighting for freeing the slaves; they was fighting to  keep Kansas from being a slave State; so when they had the North  whipped, I mean the South had 'em whipped, they called for the Negroes  to go out and fight for his freedom. Don't know nothing 'bout Jeff  Davis. I've handled a lots of his money. It was counterfeited after  the War.    I've been married four times. I had one wife and three women. I mean  the three wasn't no good. My first wife's name: Amanda Nelson. 2nd:  Pocahuntas Jackson. 3rd: Nannie Shumpard. We lived together 9 years.  She tried to beat me out of my home.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    MARTHA CUNNINGHAM  (white) Age 81 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma      My father's name was A. J. Brown, and my mother's name was Hattie  Brown. I was born in the East, in Saveer County, Tennessee. I had  twelve sisters and brothers, all are dead but two. W. S. Brown lives  at 327 W. California, and Maudie Reynolds, my sister lives at  Minrovie, California.    We lived in different kinds of houses just like we do now. Some was of  log, some frame and some rock. I remember when we didn't have stoves  to cook on, no lamps, and not even any candles until I was about six  years old. We would take a rag and sop it in lard to make lights.    All of our furniture was home made, but it was nice. We had just  plenty of every thing. It wasn't like it is in these days where you  have to pick and scrape for something to eat.    My grandfather and grandmother gave my mother and father two slaves,  an old woman and man, when they married. My grandfather owned a large  plantation, and had a large number of slaves, and my father and mother  owned several farms at different places. Our mother and father treated  our slaves good. They ate what we ate, and they stayed with us a long  time after the War. I remember though all of the slave owners weren't  good to their slaves. I have seen 'em take those young fine looking  negroes, put them in a pen when they got ready to whip them, strip  them and lay them face down, and beat them until white whelps arose on  their bodies. Yes, some of them was treated awful mean.    I saw mothers sold from their babies, and babies sold from their  mothers. They would strip them, put them on the auction block and sell  them--bid them off just like you would cattle. Some would sell for  lots of money.    They wouldn't take the slaves to church. I don't remember when the  negroes had their first schools, but it was a long time after the War.    Why, I remember when they'd have those big corn shuckings, flax  pullings, and quilting parties. They would sow acres after acres of  flax, then they would meet at some house or plantation and pull flax  until they had finished, then give a big party. There'd be the same  thing at the next plantation and so on until they'd all in that  neighborhood get their crops gathered. I remember they'd have all  kinds of good eats--pies, cakes, chicken, fish, fresh pork,  beef,--just plenty of good eats.    I went over the battlefield at Knoxville, Tennessee, two or three  hours after the Yankees and the Rebels had a battle. It was about a  mile from our house, and I walked over hundreds of dead men lying on  the ground. Some were fatally wounded, and we carried about six or  seven to our house. I saw the doctor pick the bullets out of their  flesh.    When the Yankees came they treated the slave owners awful mean. They  drew a gun on my mother, made her walk for several miles one real cold  night and take them up on the top of a mountain and show them where a  still was. They would make her cook for 'em. They took every thing we  had. I was about twelve years old at that time.    I stayed there with my mother until after my father died, then we  moved to Alabama. I was about 22 years old. I married a man named  Kelley. He and my brothers were railroad graders. We traveled all over  Texas.    I made the Run. Came here in '89 with my mother, husband and eight  children. My husband and brothers graded the streets for the townsite  of Oklahoma City and platted it off.    When we made the Run, we just stood on the property until it was  surveyed, then we'd pay $1.00, and the lot was ours. I camped on the  corner of Robinson and Pottawatomie Streets and Robinson and  Chickasaw. I owned the Northwest corner. I later sold both lots.    I am a Christian, Baptist mostly, I guess, and I believe in the Great  Beyond. I don't think you have to go to church all the time to be  saved, but you have to be right with the Man up yonder before you can  be saved.    I am a Republican, and it makes my blood boil whenever I hear a negro  say he is a democrat. They should all be Republicans.    I have been married twice. I married William Cunningham here in 1922.  He is dead; in fact, both my husbands are dead, so I don't see much  need of talking about them.
