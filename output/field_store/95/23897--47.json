[1516]    The subsequent year Cabot made a second voyage, inspecting the American  coast northward till icebergs were met, southward to the vicinity of  Albemarle Sound. Possibly in his first expedition, probably in the  second, John Cabot was accompanied by his more famous son, Sebastian.  For many years after the Cabots, England made little effort to explore  the New World. Henry VII. was a Catholic. He therefore submitted to the  Pope's bull which gave America to Spain. Henry VIII. had married  Catherine of Aragon. He allowed Ferdinand, her father, to employ the  skill and daring of Sebastian Cabot in behalf of Spain. It was reserved  for the splendid reign of Elizabeth to show what English courage and  endurance could accomplish in extending England's power.    [Illustration: Sebastian Cabot. From an old print.]    [1576]    Like those before him, Martin Frobisher was in earnest to find the  northwest passage, in whose existence all navigators then fully  believed. Like Columbus, he vainly sought friends to aid him. At last,  after he had waited fifteen years in vain, Dudley, the Earl of Warwick,  helped him to an outfit. His little fleet embraced the Gabriel, of  thirty-five tons, the Michael of thirty, and a pinnace of ten. As it  swept to sea past Greenwich, the Queen waved her hand in token of  good-will. Sailing northward near the Shetland Isles, Frobisher passed  the southern shore of Greenland and came in sight of Labrador, 1576.    He effected a landing at Hall's Island, at the mouth of the bay now  called by his name, but which he thought to be a strait, his discovery  thus strengthening his belief in the possibility of reaching Asia by  this westward course. He sailed up the bay as far as Butcher's Island,  where five of his men were taken prisoners by the natives. All effort to  rescue them was made, but to no purpose. Among the curiosities which he  brought home was a piece of stone, or black ore, which gave rise to the  belief that gold was to be found in this new country.    [1577]    A second and larger expedition sailed in 1577. The Queen gave 1,000  pounds and lent the royal ship Aid, of two hundred tons. The Gabriel and  the Michael of the former year were again made ready, besides smaller  craft. This voyage was to seek gold rather than to discover the  northwest passage. The fleet set sail May 27th, and on July 18th arrived  off North Foreland, or Hall's Island, so named for the man who had  brought away the piece of black earth. Search was made for this metal,  supposed to be so valuable, and large quantities were found. The fleet  sailed back to England with a heavy cargo of it.    In 1578 a third and the last voyage was made to this region, to which  the name meta incognita was given. Two large ships were furnished by the  Queen, and these were accompanied by thirteen smaller ones.    [1578-1580]    It was now the purpose to found a colony. The expedition set sail May  31st, going through the English Channel, and reaching the coast of  Greenland June 21st. Frobisher and a few of his sailors landed where,  perhaps, white men had never trodden before. As he came near the bay he  was driven south by stormy weather, and entered, not knowing his  whereabouts, the waters of Hudson's Straits, which he traversed a  distance of sixty miles. He succeeded at length in retracing his course,  and anchored on the southern shore of Frobisher's Bay, in the Countess  of Warwick's Sound. But the desire for gold, the bleak winds, barren  shores, and drifting icebergs, all combined to dispel the hopes of  making a successful settlement, and the adventurers turned their faces  homeward, carrying once more a cargo of ore, which proved, like the  first, to be of no value whatever.    Almost three hundred years later Captain Hall, the American explorer,  visited the Countess's Island and Sound. Among the Eskimos, from 1860 to  1862, he learned the tradition of Frobisher's visits, which had been  preserved and handed down. They knew the number of ships; they spoke of  the three times that white men had come; how five of these strangers had  been taken captive, and how, after remaining through the winter, they  had been allowed to build a boat, and to launch themselves upon the icy  seas, never to be heard of more. Captain Hall was shown many relics of  Frobisher's voyages, some of which he sent to the Royal Geographical  Society of London, a part to the Smithsonian Institute at Washington.  The small English house of lime and stone on this island was still  standing in good condition, and there was also a trench where they had  built their ill-fated boat.    [Illustration: An Indian Village at the Roanoke Settlement.]    A contemporary of Frobisher, Sir Francis Drake, also entertained the  idea of making the northwest passage. While engaged in privateering or  piratical expeditions against the Spanish, Drake landed on the Isthmus  of Panama, saw the Pacific for the first time, and determined to enter  it by the Straits of Magellan. In 1577 he made his way through the  straits, plundered the Spanish along the coast of Chili and Peru, and  sailed as far north as the 48th parallel, or Oregon, calling the country  New Albion. Steering homeward by the Cape of Good Hope, he arrived at  Plymouth, his starting-point, in 1580, having been absent about two  years and ten months.    [Illustration: Sir Humphrey Gilbert.]    Thomas Cavendish had been with Grenville in the voyage of 1585 to  Virginia. Frobisher's attempts inspired him with the ambition of the  age. In 1586 he, too, sailed through the Straits of Magellan, burning  and plundering Spanish ships, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and reached  Plymouth in 1588, having been gone about two years and fifty days.    [Illustration: Sir Walter Raleigh. From a portrait attributed to Zuccaro  in the National Portrait Gallery, London.]    [1584]    These half-piratical attempts against Spain led continually into  American waters, till the notion of forming a permanent outpost here as  base for such adventures suggested to Sir Humphrey Gilbert the plan,  which he failed to realize, of founding an American settlement. Gilbert  visited our shores in 1579, and again in 1583, but was lost on his  return from the latter voyage.    In 1584 Sir Walter Raleigh sent two captains, Amidas and Barlow, to  inspect the coast off what is now North Carolina. They reported so  favorably that he began, next year, a colony on Roanoke Island. England  was now a Protestant land, and no longer heeded Spanish claims to the  transatlantic continent, save so far as actual settlements had been  made.    [1586]    Sir Richard Grenville commanded this expedition, but was to return on  seeing the one hundred and eight colonists who accompanied him well  established. Queen Elizabeth gave the name VIRGINIA to the new country.  Drake, tending homeward from one of his raids on the Spanish coast, in  1586, offered the settlers supplies, but finding them wholly  discouraged, he carried them back to England.    [Illustration: Queen Elizabeth.]    [1587]    Determined to plant an agricultural community, Raleigh next time, l587,  sent men with their families. A daughter to one of these, named Dare,  was the first child of English parents born in America. Becoming  destitute, the colony despatched its governor home for supplies. He  returned to find the settlement deserted, and no tidings as to the fate  of the poor colonists have ever been heard from that day to our own. The  Jamestown settlers mentioned in the next chapter found among their  Indian neighbors a boy whose whitish complexion and wavy hair induced  the interesting suspicion that he was descended from some one of these  lost colonists of Roanoke.    Thus Sir Walter's enterprise had to be abandoned. In the 40,000 pounds  spent upon it his means were exhausted. Besides, England was now at war  with Spain, and the entire energies of the nation were in requisition  for the overthrow of the Spanish Armada.        CHAPTER IV.    THE PLANTING OF VIRGINIA    [1606]    We have now arrived at the seventeenth century. In 1606 King James I.  issued the first English colonial charter. It created a first and a  second Virginia Company, the one having its centre in London, and coming  to be known as the London Company; the other made up of Bristol, Exeter,  and Plymouth men, and gradually taking the title of the Plymouth  Company. This latter company, the second, or Plymouth Company,  authorized to plant between 38 degrees and 45 degrees north, effected a  settlement in 1607 at the mouth of the Kennebec River. Little came of it  but suffering, the colonists, after a severe winter, returning to  England.    [Illustration: King James I. Mr. Henry Irving's Collection.]    [1607]    A colony of one hundred and five planters sent out by the first or  London Company, proceeded, also in 1607, to Chesapeake Bay, entering  James River, to which they indeed gave this name, and planted upon its  banks Jamestown, the first permanent English colony on the continent.  This London Company consisted of a council in England, appointed by the  king, having the power to name the members of a local council which was  to govern the colony, the colonists themselves having no voice.    It is well known that the very earliest population of the Old Dominion  was not of the highest, but predominantly idle and thriftless. Vagabonds  and homeless children picked up in the streets of London, as well as  some convicts, were sent to the colony from England to be indented as  servants, permanently, or for a term of years. Persons of the better  class, to be sure, came as well, and the quality of the population, on  the whole, improved year by year. Settlement here followed a centrifugal  tendency, except as this was repressed by fear of the Indians.

But forgive them and pass it over.       Verily God loveth those who act generously.\"--_Sura V._    But there could be no peace or mutual agreement on the part of the enemy  until the truce of Hodeibia, which was also violated by them in a short  time.    Even in the wars which were waged for self-preservation, the Prophet had  very much mitigated the evils which are necessarily inflicted in the  progress of wars. Fraud, perfidy, cruelty, killing women, children and  aged persons were forbidden by Mohammad;[25] and a kind treatment of the  prisoners of war enjoined. But foremost of these all--slavery, and  domestication of concubinary slaves, the concomitant evils of war--were  abolished by him, ordering at the same time that prisoners of war should  be either liberated gratis or ransomed. Neither they were to be enslaved  nor killed. (_Vide_ Sura XLVII, verses 4 and 5; and Appendix B of this  work.) Attacking offensively was forbidden by the Koran (II, 186 _La  Taatadu_, _i.e._ 'Do not attack first'). Mohammad had taken oaths from  the Moslems to refrain from plundering (_vide_ page 58 of this book).         \"All hostilities and plundering excursions between neighbouring       tribes that had become Musalman he forbade on pain of death; and       this among those who had hitherto lived by plunder or by war, and       who he knew might be deterred by such prohibition from joining him.       'Let us make one more expedition against the Temim,' said a tribe       that was almost, but not altogether, persuaded to embrace the       faith, 'and then we will become Musalmans.'\"[26]         \"In avenging my injuries,\" said he (Mohammad), \"molest not the       harmless votaries of domestic seclusion; spare the weakness of the       softer sex, the infant at the breast, and those who in the course       of nature are hastening from this scene of mortality. Abstain from       demolishing the dwellings of the unresisting inhabitants; destroy       not their means of subsistence, respect their fruit trees, and       touch not the palm, so useful to the Syrians for its shade, and       delightful for its verdure.\"[27]         \"The Bani Bakr,\" writes Sir W. Muir, \"meanwhile, foreseeing from       the practice of the Prophet that, under the new faith, their mutual       enmities would be stifled, resolved upon a last passage of arms       with their foes. The battle of _Shaitain_ fought at the close of       630 A.D. was a bloody and fatal one to the Bani Tamim.\"[28]    [Footnote 23: \"Decline and Fall, Chap. 1.\"]    [Footnote 24: The Life of Mahomet, founder of the religion of Islamism  and of the Empire of the Saracens, by the Rev.

There is another view of the wars of Mohammad held by some of the  European and American writers that he commenced hostilities on the  caravans of the Koreish which passed from Medina by way of reprisal and  retaliation,[29] and that he at first took up arms in his self-defence,  but at last he proclaimed, and waged, offensive wars against the  Koreish.[30] I have already shown how improbable the line of action was  on the part of Mohammad under the circumstances at Medina; and this line  of policy is quite contrary to the several verses of the Koran on the  subject, all enjoining the waging of wars in self-defence. But supposing  that hostilities were first commenced by Mohammad after the Hegira, the  state of war having commenced at the expulsion of the Moslems from  Mecca, it was lawful for him to take up arms to redress the wrongs of  the Moslems and to establish their lawful right by force of arms. A war  commenced on these grounds is a defensive war, though from a military  point of view it may be an offensive one.[31]         \"The right of self-defence,\" writes Kent, a great authority on the       International Law, \"is part of the law of our nature, and it is the       indispensable duty of civil society to protect its members in the       enjoyment of their rights, both of person and property. This is the       fundamental principle of the social compact.... The injury may       consist, not only in the direct violation of personal or political       rights, but in wrongfully withholding what is due, or in the       refusal of a reasonable reparation for injuries committed, or of       adequate explanation or security in respect to manifest and       impending danger.\"[32]    [Footnote 29: Sir W. Muir doubts the intense hatred and bitter cruelty  attributed by tradition to the Koreish, and says: \"In accordance with  this view is the fact that the first aggressions, after the Hegira, were  solely on the part of Mahomet and his followers. It was not until  several of their caravans had been waylaid and plundered and blood had  thus been shed that the people of Mecca were forced in self-defence to  resort to arms.\" The Life of Mahomet, Vol. II, page 265, foot-note.  London, 1861. This note disappears in the new edition of 1877. In his  work \"The Coran,\" page 24, London, 1878, Sir W. Muir says: \"The caravans  of Mecca offered a tempting opportunity for reprisals, and several  expeditions were organized against them.\"]    [Footnote 30: Mr. G. Sale writes: \"He gave out that God had allowed him  and his followers to defend themselves against the infidels; and at  length, as his forces increased, he pretended to have the divine leave  even to attack them.\" _The Prelim. Dis. Sect. 11._ Mr. Henry Coppee  writes regarding Mohammad: \"But he soon found that he must take up arms  in self defence, and in the thirteenth year of his mission, he announced  that God permitted him not only to fight in his self-defence, but to  propagate his religion by the sword.\" History of the Conquest of Spain  by the Arab-Moors, by Henry Coppee. Vol. I, page 39. Boston, 1881. But  Dr. A. Sprenger makes the object of the wars of Mohammad purely  defensive. He writes:--\"The Prophet now promulgated, in the name of God,  the law to fight their enemies, in order to put a stop to persecutions;  and this became henceforth the watchword of his bloody religion.\" The  Life of Mohammad, p. 207: Allahabad, 1851.]    [Footnote 31: M. Bluntschili, a modern authority on the International  Law, holds: \"A war undertaken for defensive motives is a defensive war,  notwithstanding that it may be militarily offensive.\" The International  Law, by William Edward Hall, M.A., Oxford, 1880, page 320.]    [Footnote 32: Kent's Commentary on International Law. Edited by J.T.  Abdy, LL.D., Second Edition, page 144.]      [Sidenote: Caravans, if waylaid, were by reprisal.]    17. As regards the threatened attack on the caravans or capturing of it,  there are not any satisfactory grounds of proof; but if they were  attacked and captured, I do not see any reason why they should be  objected to. When hostilities commence, the first objects that naturally  present themselves for detection and seizure are the person and property  of the enemy. Even under the International Law of most civilized  countries, the legitimacy of appropriating the enemy's property rests on  the commencement of the state of war. Under the old customs of war a  belligerent possessed the right to seize and appropriate all the  property belonging to an enemy's state or its subjects, of whatever kind  they be or in whatsoever place where the acts of war are permissible. So  those who object to the early Moslems' threatening, or capturing, or  appropriating the person or property of the enemy, and call them  robbery, rapine or brigandage, show their complete ignorance of the  International Law, ancient or modern.      [Sidenote: Intolerance--no compulsory conversion enjoined, or took  place during Mohammad's life-time.]    18. The subject of the alleged intolerance on the part of Mohammad, the  Prophet, towards the unbelievers has been fully discussed in paragraphs  34-39 (pp. 41-51). It is altogether a wrong assumption of European  writers that the Koran enjoins compulsory conversion of the unbeliever,  or that Mohammad proselytized at the point of the sword. Sir W. Muir  writes:--    [Sidenote: Sir W. Muir quoted.]         \"Persecution, though it may sometimes have deterred the timid from       joining his ranks, was eventually of unquestionable service to       Mahomet. It furnished a plausible excuse for casting aside the garb       of toleration; for opposing force to force against those who       obstructed the ways of the Lord; and last of all for the compulsory       conversion of unbelievers.\"[33]    Opposing force to force and even redressing our wrongs and  re-establishing our imperilled rights is not 'intolerance.' Mohammad did  repel the force of his enemies when it was quite necessary for the  Moslem self-preservation and protection, but he never compelled any of  his enemies or unbelievers, whether a single individual, or a body of  men, or a whole tribe, to believe in him. The Koran and history  contradict such an allegation. The Koran everywhere in the Meccan and  Medinite Suras"]]]
