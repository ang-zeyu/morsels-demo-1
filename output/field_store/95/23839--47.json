He got Prentises, Servants, and Schollars many  play dayes, and therefore was well beloved by them also, and made all  merry with Bagpipes, Fiddles, and other musicks, Giggs, Dances, and  Mummings, yea, the young people had more merry dayes and houres before  him whilst he stayd, which was in some houses 12 dayes, in some 20, in  some more, in some lesse, than in all the yeare againe.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"All you, therefore, that by your diligent inquirie, can tell me anie  tidings of this ould man called Christmas, and tell me where he may be  met withall; whether in any of your streets, or elsewhere, though in  never so straitned a place; in an Applewoman's staul or Grocer's  Curren Tub, in a Cooke's Oven or the Maide's Porrige pot, or crept  into some corner of a Translater's shop, where the Cobler was wont so  merrily to chant his Carolls; whosoever can tel what is become of him,  or where he may be found, let them bring him back againe into England,  to the Crier, and they shall have a Benediction from the Pope, an  hundred oaths from the Cavaliers, 40 kisses from the Wanton Wenches,  and be made Pursevant to the next Arch Bishop. Malignants will send  him a piece of Braune, and everie Prentice boy will give him his point  (? _pint of wine_) next holie Thursday, the good Wives will keepe him  in some corners of their mince pies, and the new Nuncio Ireland will  returne him to be canonized the next Reformation of the Calender.         \"_And so Pope save Christmas._    \"_Cryer_--Lady, I am come to tell you what returne I can make you of  the crying of old Father Christmas, which I have done, and am now here  to give you an answer.    \"_Lady_--Well said, honest Cryer, Mr. Woodcock will remember you for  it.    \"_Cryer_--The poor old man upon St. Thomas his day was arraigned,  condemned, and after conviction cast into prison amongst the King's  Souldiers; fearing to be hanged, or some other execution to be done  upon him, and got out at so narrow a passage, between two Iron Bars of  a Window, that nothing but onely his old gray beard and hoarie haire  of his head stuck there, but nothing else to be seen of him; and, if  you will have that, compound for it, lest it be sold among the  sequestred goods, or burnt with the next Popish pictures, by the hand  of the hangman.    \"_Lady_--But is old, old, good old Christmas gone? Nothing but the  hair of his good, grave old head and beard left! Well I will have  that, seeing I cannot have more of him, one lock whereof will serve  _Mr. Woodcock_ for a token. But what is the event of his departure?    \"_Cryer_--The poor are sory for it, for they go to every door  a-begging as they were wont to do (_Good Mrs., somewhat against this  good Time_); but Time was transformed (_Away, begone, here is not for  you_); and so they, instead of going to the Ale-house to be drunk,  were fain to work all the Holidayes. The Schollers came into the Hall,  where their hungry stomacks had thought to have found good Brawn and  Christmas pies, Roast Beef and Plum-porridge; but no such matter.  Away, ye prophane, these are superstitious meats; your stomacks must  be fed with wholesome doctrine. Alas, poor tallow-faced Chandlers, I  met them mourning through the streets, and complaining that they could  get no vent for their Mustard, for want of Brawn.    \"_Lady_--Well, if ever the Catholiques or Bishops rule again in  England, they will set the Church dores open on Christmas day, and we  shall have Masse at the High Altar, as was used when the day was first  instituted, and not have the holy Eucharist barred out of School, as  School boyes do their Masters against the festival![7] What! shall we  have our mouths shut to welcome old Christmas? No, no, bid him come by  night over the Thames, and we will have a back door open to let him  in. I will, myself, give him his diet for one year, to try his fortune  this time twelve month, it may prove better.\"    [Footnote 7: This Saturnalia of barring out the Schoolmaster at  Christmas--just before breaking up--was in use certainly as late as  1888. Vide _Notes and Queries_, 7th series, vol. vi. p. 484.]          CHAPTER V         The popular love of Christmas--Riots at Ealing and       Canterbury--Evelyn's Christmas days, 1652 '3 '4 '5       '7--Cromwell and Christ-tide--The Restoration--Pepys and       Christmas day, 1662--\"The Examination and Tryal of old       Father Christmas.\"      And this was the general feeling. Parliament might sit, as we learn by  _The Kingdome's Weekly Intelligencer_, No. 152: \"Thursday, December  25, vulgarly known by the name of Christmas Day, both Houses sate. The  House of Commons, more especially, debated some things in reference to  the privileges of that House, and made some orders therein.\" But the  mass of the people quietly protested against this way of ignoring  Christ-tide, and notwithstanding the Assembly of Divines and  Parliament, no shops were open in London on that day, in spite of the  article published in No. 135 of _Mercurius Civicus, or London's  Intelligencer_, which explained the absurdity of keeping Christmas  day, and ordained that all shops should be opened, and that the  shopkeepers should see that their apprentices were at work on that  day. If they needed a holiday, \"let them keep the fift of November,  and other dayes of that nature, or the late great mercy of God in the  taking of Hereford, which deserves an especiall day of thanks giving.\"  It would not so much have mattered if all the Puritans had followed  the example of George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, who, \"when the  time called Christmas came, when others were feasting and sporting  themselves, went from house to house seeking out the poor and  desolate, and giving them money.\"    Parliament, although they did their best by public example to do away  with it, sitting every Christmas day from 1644 to 1656, could not  extinguish the deep-rooted feeling in favour of its being kept up in  the old-fashioned way, and, in London, at Christmas 1646, those who  opened their shops were very roughly used, so much so that in 1647  they asked the Parliament to protect them in future. Certainly, in  that year, the shops were all closed, but the irrepressible love of  Christmas could not be controlled, and the porters of Cornhill  bedecked the conduit with \"Ivy, Rosmary, and Bays,\" and similar  decorations were exhibited in other parts of the City--a proceeding  which sorely exercised the Lord Mayor and the City Marshal, who rode  about, with their followings, setting fire to the harmless green  stuff--the doing of which occasioned great mirth among the Royalist  party.    There were riots about the keeping of Christmas in several parts of  the country--notably one at Ealing, in Middlesex; but there was a  famous one at Canterbury,[8] the particulars of which are given in a  short tract, which I here reprint, as it shows the feeling in the  country:    [Footnote 8: \"Canterbury Christmas; or, A True Relation of the  Insurrection in Canterbury on Christmas Day last, with the great hurt  that befell divers persons thereby.\"]    \"Upon Wednesday, _Decem._ 22, the Cryer of _Canterbury_ by the  appointment of Master _Major_,[9] openly proclaimed that Christmas  day, and all other Superstitious Festivals should be put downe, and  that a Market should be kept upon _Christmas day_.    [Footnote 9: Mayor.]    \"Which not being observed (but very ill taken by the Country) the  towne was thereby unserved with provision, and trading very much  hindered; which occasioned great discontent among the people, caused  them to rise in a Rebellious way.    \"The _Major_ being slighted, and his Commands observed only of a few  who opened their Shops, to the number of 12 at the most: They were  commanded by the multitude to shut up again, but refusing to obey,  their ware was thrown up and down, and they, at last, forced to shut  in.    \"The _Major_ and his assistants used their best endeavours to qualifie  this tumult, but the fire being once kindled, was not easily quenched.    \"The _Sheriffe_ laying hold of a fellow, was stoutly resisted; which  the _Major_ perceiving, took a Cudgell, and strook the man: who,  being now puny, pulled up his courage, and knockt down the _Major_,  whereby his Cloak was much torne and durty, besides the hurt he  received.    \"The _Major_ hereupon made strict Proclamation for keeping the Peace,  and that every man depart to his own house.    \"The multitude hollowing thereat, in disorderly manner; the _Aldermen_  and _Constables_ caught two or three of the rout, and sent them to the  Jaile, but they soon broke loose, and Jeered Master _Alderman_.    \"Soone after, issued forth the Commanders of this Rabble, with an  addition of Souldiers, into the high street, and brought with them two  Foot-balls, whereby their company increased. Which the _Major_ and  _Aldermen_ perceiving, took what prisoners they had got, and would  have carried them to the Jayle. But the multitude following after to  the _King's Bench_, were opposed by Captain _Bridg_, who was straight  knoct down, and had his head broke in two places, not being able to  withstand the multitude, who, getting betwixt him and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#8)"],[1,"y, whatever rare and delicate service they set it  upon.    [Note 7: Several reasons may account for the fact that goldsmith's  work is so wholesome for young artists: first, that it gives great  firmness of hand to deal for some time with a solid substance; again,  that it induces caution and steadiness--a boy trusted with chalk and  paper suffers an immediate temptation to scrawl upon it and play with  it, but he dares not scrawl on gold, and he cannot play with it; and,  lastly, that it gives great delicacy and precision of touch to work upon  minute forms, and to aim at producing richness and finish of design  correspondent to the preciousness of the material.]    [Note 8: See note in Addenda on the nature of property.]      47. So here is one branch of decorative art in which rich people may  indulge themselves unselfishly; if they ask for good art in it, they may  be sure in buying gold and silver plate that they are enforcing useful  education on young artists. But there is another branch of decorative  art in which I am sorry to say we cannot, at least under existing  circumstances, indulge ourselves, with the hope of doing good to  anybody: I mean the great and subtle art of dress.      48. And here I must interrupt the pursuit of our subject for a moment or  two, in order to state one of the principles of political economy,  which, though it is, I believe, now sufficiently understood and asserted  by the leading masters of the science, is not yet, I grieve to say,  acted upon by the plurality of those who have the management of riches.  Whenever we spend money, we of course set people to work: that is the  meaning of spending money; we may, indeed, lose it without employing  anybody; but, whenever we spend it, we set a number of people to work,  greater or less, of course, according to the rate of wages, but, in the  long run, proportioned to the sum we spend. Well, your shallow people,  because they see that however they spend money they are always employing  somebody, and, therefore, doing some good, think and say to themselves,  that it is all one _how_ they spend it--that all their apparently  selfish luxury is, in reality, unselfish, and is doing just as much  good as if they gave all their money away, or perhaps more good; and I  have heard foolish people even declare it as a principle of political  economy, that whoever invented a new want[9] conferred a good on the  community. I have not words strong enough--at least, I could not,  without shocking you, use the words which would be strong enough--to  express my estimate of the absurdity and the mischievousness of this  popular fallacy. So, putting a great restraint upon myself, and using no  hard words, I will simply try to state the nature of it, and the extent  of its influence.    [Note 9: See note 5th, in Addenda.]      49. Granted, that whenever we spend money for whatever purpose, we set  people to work; and passing by, for the moment, the question whether the  work we set them to is all equally healthy and good for them, we will  assume that whenever we spend a guinea we provide an equal number of  people with healthy maintenance for a given time. But, by the way in  which we spend it, we entirely direct the labour of those people during  that given time. We become their masters or mistresses, and we compel  them to produce, within a certain period, a certain article. Now, that  article may be a useful and lasting one, or it may be a useless and  perishable one--it may be one useful to the whole community, or useful  only to ourselves. And our selfishness and folly, or our virtue and  prudence, are shown, not by our spending money, but by our spending it  for the wrong or the right thing; and we are wise and kind, not in  maintaining a certain number of people for a given period, but only in  requiring them to produce during that period, the kind of things which  shall be useful to society, instead of those which are only useful to  ourselves.      50. Thus, for instance: if you are a young lady, and employ a certain  number of sempstresses for a given time, in making a given number of  simple and serviceable dresses--suppose, seven; of which you can wear  one yourself for half the winter, and give six away to poor girls who  have none, you are spending your money unselfishly. But if you  employ the same number of sempstresses for the same number of days,  in making four, or five, or six beautiful flounces for your own  ball-dress--flounces which will clothe no one but yourself, and which  you will yourself be unable to wear at more than one ball--you are  employing your money selfishly. You have maintained, indeed, in each  case, the same number of people; but in the one case you have directed  their labour to the service of the community; in the other case you have  consumed it wholly upon yourself. I don't say you are never to do so; I  don't say you ought not sometimes to think of yourselves only, and to  make yourselves as pretty as you can; only do not confuse coquettishness  with benevolence, nor cheat yourselves into thinking that all the finery  you can wear is so much put into the hungry mouths of those beneath you:  it is not so; it is what you yourselves, whether you will or no, must  sometimes instinctively feel it to be--it is what those who stand  shivering in the streets, forming a line to watch you as you step out of  your carriages, _know_ it to be; those fine dresses do not mean that so  much has been put into their mouths, but that so much has been taken out  of their mouths.      51. The real politico-economical signification of every one of those  beautiful toilettes, is just this: that you have had a certain number of  people put for a certain number of days wholly under your authority, by  the sternest of slave-masters--hunger and cold; and you have said to  them, \"I will feed you, indeed, and clothe you, and give you fuel for so  many days; but during those days you shall work for me only: your little  brothers need clothes, but you shall make none for them: your sick  friend needs clothes, but you shall make none for her: you yourself will  soon need another and a warmer dress, but you shall make none for  yourself. You shall make nothing but lace and roses for me; for this  fortnight to come, you shall work at the patterns and petals, and then I  will crush and consume them away in an hour.\" You will perhaps  answer--\"It may not be particularly benevolent to do this, and we won't  call it so; but at any rate we do no wrong in taking their labour when  we pay them their wages: if we pay for their work, we have a right to  it.\"      52. No;--a thousand times no. The labour which you have paid for, does  indeed become, by the act of purchase, your own labour: you have bought  the hands and the time of those workers; they are, by right and justice,  your own hands, your own time. But have you a right to spend your own  time, to work with your own hands, only for your own advantage?--much  more, when, by purchase, you have invested your own person with the  strength of others; and added to your own life, a part of the life of  others? You may, indeed, to a certain extent, use their labour for your  delight: remember, I am making no general assertions against splendour  of dress, or pomp of accessories of life; on the contrary, there are  many reasons for thinking that we do not at present attach enough  importance to beautiful dress, as one of the means of influencing  general taste and character. But I _do_ say, that you must weigh the  value of what you ask these workers to produce for you in its own  distinct balance; that on its own worthiness or desirableness rests the  question of your kindness, and not merely on the fact of your having  employed people in producing it: and I say further, that as long as  there are cold and nakedness in the land around you, so long there can  be no question at all but that splendour of dress is a crime. In due  time, when we have nothing better to set people to work at, it may be  right to let them make lace and cut jewels; but as long as there are any  who have no blankets for their beds, and no rags for their bodies, so  long it is blanket-making and tailoring we must set people to work  at--not lace.      53. And it would be strange, if at any great assembly which, while it  dazzled the young and the thoughtless, beguiled the gentler hearts that  beat beneath the embroidery, with a placid sensation of luxurious  benevolence--as if by all that they wore in waywardness of beauty,  comfort had been first given to the distressed, and aid to the indigent;  it would be strange, I say, if, for a moment, the spirits of Truth and  of Terror, which walk invisibly among the masques of the earth, would  lift the dimness from our erring thoughts, and show us how--inasmuch as  the sums exhausted for that magnificence would have given back the  failing breath to many an unsheltered outcast on moor and street--they  who wear it have literally entered into partnership with Death; and  dressed themselves in his spoils. Yes, if the veil could be lifted not  only from your thoughts, but from your human sight, you would see--the  angels do see--on those gay white dresses of yours, strange dark spots,  and crimson patterns that you knew not of--spots of the inextinguishable  red that all the seas cannot wash away; yes, and among the pleasant  flowers that crown your fair heads, and glow on your wreathed hair, you  would see that one weed was always twisted which no one thought of--the  grass that grows on graves.      54. It was not, however, this last, this clearest and most appalling  view of our subject, that I intended to ask you to take this evening;  only it is impossible to set any part of the matter in its true light,  until we go to the root of it. But the point which it is our special  business to consider is, not whether costliness of dress is contrary to  charity; but whether it"]]]
