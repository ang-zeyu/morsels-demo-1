It's monstrous!\"    \"Oh, Everard, what _shall_ we do?\"    \"I don't know. I'm going out to think it over. Don't say a word about it  to anybody yet. Promise me you won't!\"    Everard seized his cap and waterproof, and plunged out-of-doors into the  rain. He did not return till dinner-time. If he was silent and  preoccupied at that meal, both Cousin Clare and Dulcie set it down as  natural to his new sense of responsibility. Lilias looked at him  uneasily. There was a hardness in his face which she had never seen  there before. She longed to catch him alone and question him, but after  dinner he purposely avoided her, and left a message that he had gone to  the stables. She would have liked to confide in Cousin Clare, but she  had given her promise to keep the secret, and even Dulcie must not share  it yet. The girls slept in separate rooms at home, so that when Lilias  had said good night to the family she was alone. She went to bed, as a  matter of course, but tossed about with throbbing heart and whirling  brain. Mr. Bowden's information had effectually banished sleep. In about  an hour, when the house was absolutely quiet, came a soft tap at her  door. She jumped up hastily, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened it.  Everard stood in the passage outside.    \"May I come in? I want to speak to you, Sissy! It's important,\" he  whispered.    \"I thought you had gone to bed,\" said Lilias, admitting him, and  dragging forward two basket chairs. \"What is it, Everard? Don't look  like that--you frighten me!\"    Her brother had seated himself wearily, and buried his head in his  hands. He raised two haggard eyes at her words.    \"I've come to say good-by to you, Sis. I'm going away to-night! Don't  speak to me, for I'm not in a mood for argument! Do you think that I  could stand by Grandfather's grave to-morrow, when I know he has  disinherited me? I tell you, I can't. I'm not going to stay and hear the  will read! If I'm kicked out of the property, at least I'll keep my  dignity. Why, everybody on the estate believed I was the heir! Only this  afternoon, Rogerson, the new under-gardener, asked me to keep him on,  and Hicks said he'd serve me as faithfully as he'd served the old  Squire. How could I face the servants when they knew the Chase wasn't  mine after all! The humiliation would be intolerable! No! I've all the  Ingleton pride in me, and if I'm not to be master here, I'll shake the  dust of the place off my feet for ever. Grandfather will have made some  provisions for you younger ones; he always promised to do that, and it's  right you should take it, but as for me, if he's left me anything, I  don't mean to touch a penny of it--it must be all or nothing! You others  are welcome to my share, whatever it is. I'm going out into the world to  earn my own living.\"    He spoke forcibly, and with desperate earnestness. To Lilias, watching  him anxiously, he seemed in these few hours to have changed from a boy  into a man. Eager words rose to her lips, but he stood up and stopped  her.    \"I've told you it's no use arguing! My mind's absolutely made up. I've  ordered Elton to have the small car ready, and to drive me to Balderton  to catch the midnight express to town. It's the last order I shall give  in this house. He looked surprised, but he didn't dare to question me.  To-morrow everybody will know that I've no more authority here than the  kids. I'll be far away by then, thank goodness.\"    \"But, Everard, what are you going to do in London? How can you earn your  own living?\" pressed Lilias.    \"Sweep a crossing, or go to sea! I don't care two-pence what happens to  me. Good-by, Sis, I'm off! You may tell the others to-morrow, if you  like. No, I won't promise to write! You'll be better without me. I've  closed this chapter of my life completely, and I'm going to begin a  different one. The two won't bear mixing up.\"    Giving his sister a hasty kiss, Everard left the room and walked softly  away down the passage. A few minutes later, Lilias heard the sound of  wheels, and, looking through the window, saw the rear lights of the car  disappearing down the drive, and away across the park. She went back to  bed, sobbing.          CHAPTER V    The New Owner      The wild wind and rain, which for some weeks had blown from the north,  changed suddenly to a southerly breeze, and the sun shone out in all its  spring glory on the day of Mr. Ingleton's funeral. Half the country-side  came to do honor to \"the old Squire.\" He had been a favorite in the  neighborhood, and people forgot his autocratic ways and remembered now  only his many kindnesses. The absence of Everard, who should have been  the chief representative of the family, caused universal comment, and  some rumor of the state of affairs began to be passed round among the  servants and guests. Cousin Clare, to whom Lilias had confided the  secret of her brother's flight, shook her head.    \"He might at least have shown his grandfather the respect of following  him to his grave!\" she commented. \"He owed that to him, at any rate. I  thought Everard would have realized such an obvious duty. Whatever comes  or does not come to us in the way of legacies cannot free us from our  obligations to the dead. It seems to me hardly decent to be thinking  about the disposal of the property while its late owner is still  unburied.\"    Lilias crept away, crying. She knew there was justice in Cousin Clare's  scathing judgment, but she was sure the latter did not, could not,  understand the extent of Everard's bitter disappointment. She did not  care to say any more, or ask questions, and could only wait until the  whole sad, miserable affair was over. Some of the guests returned to the  house after the funeral, and these, with the family, were present when  Mr. Bowden read aloud the will of the late Squire of Cheverley Chase.  Like most testamentary documents, it was couched in legal terms, but  Lilias and Dulcie, sitting in their black dresses beside Cousin Clare,  grasped the main features. There were certain legacies to servants and  friends, a provision for each of the grandchildren and for Cousin Clare,  then the entire residue of the estate was bequeathed to \"Leslie, only  child of my elder son, Tristram.\"    All, except the few who had known the secret beforehand, were filled  with surprise that Everard, who had always been regarded in the  neighborhood as \"the young squire\" should have been passed over in favor  of another heir. The guests, however, after a word or two of sympathy,  took their departure, and went away to spread the news, leaving the  family alone to discuss matters among themselves.    \"So I suppose the Chase isn't our home any longer?\" asked Dulcie, as the  young Ingletons clustered round their cousin for explanations. \"Who is  this Leslie? We've never heard anything of him before.\"    \"I didn't know Uncle Tristram had a son!\" said Roland.    \"Will everything be his instead of Everard's?\" asked Bevis pitifully.    \"No, and yes,\" replied Cousin Clare. \"The estate is certainly left to  Leslie, but, as it happens, she is a daughter, and not a son.\"    Here was a surprise indeed!    \"A daughter!\" echoed Lilias. \"The Chase left to a girl!\"    \"Remember, she is the daughter of the elder son, so that in your  grandfather's opinion she was the lawful heiress.\"    \"But where does she live?\"    \"How old is she?\"    \"Why have we never seen her?\"    \"It's a long story,\" said Cousin Clare. \"But, without going into any  details, I can tell you briefly that years ago your grandfather and your  Uncle Tristram had a serious quarrel. It was about a lady whom your  grandfather thought his elder son loved, and whom he very much wished  him to marry. Well, we can't love to order, and, though Tristram liked  and respected the prospective bride whom his father had chosen for him,  he had given his heart to a beautiful Italian girl, and he insisted upon  marrying her. The affair caused a complete breach between them, but  shortly before Tristram's death he patched up a half reconciliation, and  sent home a photograph of his wife and little daughter, whom he named  'Leslie' after her grandfather. I believe some years ago an effort was  made to bring the child over to England to be educated, but her mother,  who by that time was married again and living in Sicily, refused to give  her up to her English relations. I have never seen her myself, but she  must be quite fourteen years old by now. It will be a great surprise to  her to learn that she succeeds to the property.\"    \"And a great disappointment to us,\" said Lilias bitterly. \"It seems most  unfair, when we've lived at the Chase all these years, that this  interloper should step in and turn us out of our home.\"    \"I hate her!\" declared Clifford, clenching his little fists.    \"No, no, dears! Don't take it in that way!\" begged Cousin Clare.  \"Remember that, after all, the Chase was Grandfather's property, and he  had absolute right to leave it to whom he pleased. He stood in the  place of parents to you all, but that did not mean that he must will the  estate to Everard. Leslie is also his grandchild, and belongs to the  elder branch of the family. He has left you each a most generous legacy,  so that there is plenty for your education. I don't know what  arrangements will be made for you, but Mr. Bowden is one of your  guardians, and he is such a kind friend that I am sure he can be  thoroughly trusted to take good care of your affairs. Try to look on the  bright side of things. Matters might be so much worse.\"    In Lilias's opinion, at any rate, matters were quite bad enough. As  Everard's particular chum, she took his disinheritance more hardly than  Dulcie. She wondered what he was doing in London, and if he would send  her his address. It angered her that Mr. Bowden took his departure quite  calmly, and seemed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#8)"],[1,"origin is more interesting and less  symmetrical than the later invented scheme of classification. The Divorce  pamphlets were written because Milton was unhappily married. The  _Areopagitica_ was written because his heterodox views concerning  marriage had brought him into collision with the Presbyterian censors of  the press. His treatise on education was written because he had  undertaken the education of his own nephews, and had become deeply  interested in that question. In all three his own experience is the first  motive; in all three that experience is concealed beneath a formidable  array of general considerations, dogmatically propounded.    The case is the same with regard to the pamphlets that treat of religious  and civil liberty; they are not only occasional, but intensely personal,  even in their origins. The earliest of them, the five ecclesiastical  pamphlets of the year 1641, deal with a question which had been of  intimate concern to Milton ever since the beginning of his Cambridge  days. The celebrated controversy with Salmasius and his abettors,  concerning the death of King Charles, is a gladiatorial combat from which  every element save the personal is often absent. In these bouts offensive  biography and defensive autobiography serve for sword and shield. This  personal character of the prose writings, while it has repelled some  readers interested mainly in the questions discussed, has attracted  others who are interested chiefly in the writer. A rich harvest of  personal allusion has been gathered from the controversial treatises, and  perhaps, even now, the field has not been gleaned to the last ear. It is  worthy of remark, for instance, how Milton's pre-occupation with the  themes which he had already pondered, and turned this way and that in his  mind, to test their fitness for a monumental work, shows itself in his  choice of figure and allusion. Attention has often been called to the  elaborate comparison, founded on the history of Samson, in _The Reason of  Church Government urged against Prelaty_:--    \"I cannot better liken the state and person of a king than to that mighty  Nazarite Samson; who being disciplined from his birth in the precepts and  the practice of temperance and sobriety, without the strong drink of  injurious and excessive desires, grows up to a noble strength and  perfection with those his illustrious and sunny locks, the laws, waving  and curling about his god-like shoulders. And while he keeps them about  him undiminished and unshorn, he may with the jawbone of an ass, that is,  with the word of his meanest officer, suppress and put to confusion  thousands of those that rise against his just power. But laying down his  head among the strumpet flatteries of prelates, while he sleeps and  thinks no harm, they, wickedly shaving off all those bright and weighty  tresses of his law, and just prerogatives, which were his ornament and  strength, deliver him over to indirect and violent counsels, which, as  those Philistines, put out the fair and far-sighted eyes of his natural  discerning, and make him grind in the prison-house of their sinister ends  and practices upon him: till he, knowing this prelatical rasor to have  bereft him of his wonted might, nourish again his puissant hair, the  golden beams of law and right; and they, sternly shook, thunder with ruin  upon the heads of those his evil counsellors, but not without great  affliction to himself.\"    This ingenious allegorical application naturally finds no place in the  grave poem of Milton's latest years. And yet, in one passage at least,  his earlier love for the high-figured style took him captive again. The  strong drink from which the Samson of the play abstains is strong drink,  not \"injurious and excessive desires.\" There is no hint of prelatical  conspiracy in the enticements of Dalila. But perhaps some faint  reminiscence of his earlier fable concerning Samson's hair recurred to  Milton's mind when he gave to Manoa a speech comparing the locks of the  hero to the strength, not of the law, but of a nation in arms:--      And I persuade me God had not permitted    His strength again to grow up with his hair,    Garrisoned round about him like a camp    Of faithful soldiery, were not his purpose    To use him further yet in some great service.    The theme of _Samson Agonistes_ had thus already taken possession of  Milton's imagination when he wrote his first prose tractates. But the  same writings furnish even stronger evidence of his early dallyings with  the theme of _Paradise Lost_. \"It was from out the rind of one apple  tasted,\" he says in the _Areopagitica_, \"that the knowledge of good and  evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into the world.\" And  again, in _The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_:--\"The academics and  stoics ... knew not what a consummate and most adorned Pandora was  bestowed upon Adam, to be the nurse and guide of his arbitrary happiness  and perseverance, I mean, his native innocence and perfection, which  might have kept him from being our true Epimetheus.\" Some of these  references show the imaginative scheme of the _Paradise Lost_ in the  process of building. In one passage, for instance, of the last quoted  treatise, Milton expounds the pagan belief that God punishes his enemies  most when he throws them furthest from him:--\"Which then they held he  did, when he blinded, hardened, and stirred up his offenders, to finish  and pile up their desperate work since they had undertaken it. To banish  for ever into a local hell, whether in the air or in the centre, or in  that uttermost and bottomless gulf of chaos, deeper from holy bliss than  the world's diameter multiplied, they thought not a punishing so proper  and proportionate for God to inflict as to punish sin with sin.\" It would  seem as if the poet had not as yet fixed the situation of his local hell,  but remained suspended between rival theories. The other idea, of the  Divine permission and impulse given to hardened sinners, finds a  conspicuous place in the poem. In one instance, at least, a figure drawn  from the story of the Creation is violently handled to serve strange  uses. The evolution of the four elements from the chaotic welter of hot,  cold, moist, and dry, is adduced as a proof that the laws of God and of  nature approve free divorce:--\"By his divorcing command the world first  rose out of chaos, nor can be renewed again out of confusion, but by the  separating of unmeet consorts.\"    Allusions of this kind occur most frequently in the earlier prose  writings, while the studies that had been interrupted by controversy were  yet fresh in Milton's memory. They would hardly be worth the quotation,  were it not that they are another evidence of the transparency of his  mind. In looking through his prose works you see traces of all that was  engaging his imagination and thought at the time. Poetry is the highest  of expressive arts; and poets are the worst dissemblers or economisers of  truth in the world. Their knowledge, like their feeling, possesses them,  and must find expression as argument, or illustration, or figure,  whatever the immediate matter in hand. The prose works of Milton are  thus, from first to last, an exposition of himself. The divorce  pamphlets, especially, are hot with smothered personal feeling. Long  years afterwards, when time and change had softened and blurred it in  memory, his early misadventure was reflected in more than one passage of  the later poems. The humble plaint of Eve, and the description of her  reunion with her alienated lord, in the Tenth Book of _Paradise Lost_,  doubtless contains, as has often been said, some reflection of what took  place at a similar interview in 1645, when Mistress Mary Milton returned  to her offended husband. That one principal cause of the rupture has been  rightly divined, by Mr. Mark Pattison and others, is probable from  certain remarkable lines in the Eighth Book, where Adam describes how he  was presented with his bride:--                          On she came,    Led by her Heavenly Maker, though unseen,    And guided by his voice, nor uninformed    Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites.    Even at so wide a remove of time, the poet's wounded pride finds  expression in this singular theory--or, rather, in this more than dubious  piece of self-justification.    But although the hurt he had suffered, in his most susceptible feelings,  gives eloquence and plangency to his divorce pamphlets, it was not merely  to voice his sufferings that he wrote those pamphlets. Most men in  Milton's position, married to \"a nothing, a desertrice, an adversary,\"  would have recognised that theirs was one of those exceptional cases for  which the law cannot provide, and would have sat down under their unhappy  chance, to bear it or mitigate it as best they might. Some poets of the  time of the Romantic Revival would have claimed the privilege of genius  to be a law unto itself; the law of the State being designed for the  common rout, whose lesser sensibilities and weaker individuality make  them amenable to its discipline. Milton did neither the one thing nor the  other. The modern idolatry of genius was as yet uninvented; he was a  citizen first, a poet and an unhappy man afterwards. He directed his  energies to proving, not that he should be exempted from the operation of  the law, but that the law itself should be changed. He had entered into  marriage, with full ceremonial ushering, by the main door; he would go  out the same way, or not at all. Thus even in this most personal matter  he pleads, not for himself, but for the commonweal. He cannot conceive of  happiness as of a private possession, to be secretly enjoyed; it stands  rooted, like justice, in the wise and equal ordinances of the State; and  the only freedom that he values is freedom under the law.    Like the citizen of some antique state, he discourses of"]]]
