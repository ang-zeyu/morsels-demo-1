Mr. Darwin sometimes says they happen by chance; sometimes  he says they happen of necessity; at others he says, \"We are profoundly  ignorant of their causes.\" These are only different ways of saying that  they are not intentional. When a man lets anything fall from his hands,  and says it was accidental, he does not mean that it was causeless, he  only means that it was not intentional. And that is precisely what  Darwin means when he says that species arise out of accidental  variations. His whole book is an argument against teleology. The whole  question is, How are we to account for the innumerable varieties, kinds,  and genera of plants and animals, including man? Were they intended? or,  Did they arise from the gradual accumulations of unintentional  variations? His answer to these questions is plain. On page 245, he  says: \"Nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that  the more complex organs and instincts have been perfected not by means  superior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by innumerable  slight variations, each good for the individual possessor.  Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination[14]  insuperably great, cannot be considered real, if we admit the following  propositions, namely, that all parts of the organizations and instincts  offer, at least, individual differences; that there is a struggle for  existence, which leads to the preservation of profitable deviations of  structure or instinct; and, lastly, that gradations in the state of  perfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind.\" He  says, over and over, that if beauty or any variation of structure can be  shown to be intended, it would \"annihilate his theory.\" His doctrine is  that such unintended variations, which happen to be useful in the  struggle for life, are preserved, on the principle of the survival of  the fittest. He urges the usual objections to teleology derived from  undeveloped or useless organs, as web-feet in the upland goose and  frigate-bird, which never swim.    What, however, perhaps more than anything, makes clear his rejection of  design is the manner in which he deals with the complicated organs of  plants and animals. Why don't he say, they are the product of the divine  intelligence? If God made them, it makes no difference, so far as the  question of design is concerned, how He made them: whether at once or by  a process of evolution. But instead of referring them to the purpose of  God, he laboriously endeavors to prove that they may be accounted for  without any design or purpose whatever.    \"To suppose,\" he says, \"that the eye with all its inimitable  contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for  admitting different degrees of light, and for the correction of  spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural  selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.\" (p.  222) Nevertheless he attempts to explain the process. \"It is scarcely  possible,\" he says, \"to avoid comparing the eye with the telescope. We  know that this instrument has been perfected by the long continued  efforts of the highest of human intellects; and we naturally infer that  the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not  this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the  Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must  compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to  take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid,  and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part  of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to  separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at  different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer  slowly changing in form. Further, we must suppose that there is a power  represented by natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, always  intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers, and  carefully preserving each, which, under varied circumstances, tends to  produce a distinct image. We must suppose each new state of the  instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be preserved until a  better is produced, and the old ones to be all destroyed. In living  bodies, variations will cause the slight alterations, generation will  multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out  with unerring skill each improvement.\"[15] (p. 226) \"Let this process,\"  he says, \"go on for millions of years,\" and we shall at last have a  perfect eye.    It would be absurd to say anything disrespectful of such a man as Mr.  Darwin, and scarcely less absurd to indulge in any mere extravagance of  language; yet we are expressing our own experience, when we say that we  regard Mr. Darwin's books the best refutation of Mr. Darwin's theory. He  constantly shuts us up to the alternative of believing that the eye is a  work of design or the product of the unintended action of blind physical  causes. To any ordinarily constituted mind, it is absolutely impossible  to believe that it is not a work of design. Darwin himself, it is  evident, dear as his theory is, can hardly believe it. \"It is  indispensable,\" he says, \"to arrive at a just conclusion as to the  formation of the eye, that the reason should conquer the imagination;  but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any  degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to  so startling an extent.\" (p. 225)    It will be observed that every step in his account of the formation of  the eye is an arbitrary assumption. We must first assume a thick layer  of tissue; then that the tissue is transparent; then that it has  cavities filled with fluid; that beneath the tissue is a nerve sensitive  to light; then that the fluid is constantly varying in density and  thickness; that its surfaces are constantly changing their contour; that  its different portions are ever shifting their relative distances; that  every favorable change is seized upon and rendered permanent,--thus  after millions of years we may get an eye as perfect as that of an  eagle. In like manner we may suppose a man to sit down to account for  the origin and contents of the Bible, assuming as his \"working  hypothesis,\" that it is not the product of mind either human or divine,  but that it was made by a type-setting machine worked by steam, and  picking out type hap-hazard. In this way in a thousand years one  sentence might be produced, in another thousand a second, and in ten  thousand more, the two might get together in the right position. Thus in  the course of \"millions of years\" the Bible might have been produced,  with all its historical details, all its elevated truths, all its  devout and sublime poetry, and above all with the delineation of the  character of Christ, the [Greek: idea ton ideon], the ideal of majesty  and loveliness, before which the whole world, believing and unbelieving,  perforce bows down in reverence. And when reason has sufficiently  subdued the imagination to admit all this, then by the same theory we  may account for all the books in all languages in all the libraries in  the world. Thus we should have Darwinism applied in the sphere of  literature. This is the theory which we are told is to sweep away  Christianity and the Church!    Mr. Darwin gives the same unsatisfactory account of the marvellous  \"contrivances\" in the vegetable world. In one species of Orchids, the  labellum or lower lip is hollowed into a great bucket continually filled  with water, secreted from two horns which stand above it; when the  bucket is sufficiently filled, the water flows out through a pipe or  spout on one side. The bees, which crowd into the flower for sake of the  nectar, jostle each other, so that some fall into the water; and their  wings becoming wet they are unable to fly, and are obliged to crawl  through the spout. In doing this they come in contact with the pollen,  which, adhering to their backs, is carried off to other flowers. This  complicated contrivance by which the female plants are fertilized has,  according to the theory, been brought about by the slow process of  natural selection or survival of the fittest.    Still more wonderful is the arrangement in another species of Orchids.  When the bee begins to gnaw the labellum, he unavoidably touches a  tapering projection, which, when touched, transmits a vibration which  ruptures a membrane, which sets free a spring by which a mass of pollen  is shot, with unerring aim, over the back of the bee, who then departs  on his errand of fertilization.    A very large class of plants are fertilized by means of insects. These  flowers are beautiful, not for the sake of beauty,--for that Mr. Darwin  says would annihilate his theory,--but those which happen to be  beautiful attract insects, and thus become fertilized and perpetuated,  while the plainer ones are neglected and perish. So with regard to  birds. The females are generally plain, because those of bright colors  are so exposed during the period of incubation that they are destroyed  by their enemies. In like manner male birds are usually adorned with  brilliant plumage. This is accounted for on the ground that they are  more attractive, and thus they propagate their race, while the plainer  ones have few or no descendants. Thus all design is studiously and  laboriously excluded from every department of nature.    The preceding pages contain only a small part of the evidence furnished  by Mr. Darwin's own writings, that his doctrine involves the denial of  all final causes. The whole drift of his books is to prove that all the  organs of plants and animals, all their instincts and mental endowments,  may be accounted for by the blind operation of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],[0,"The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#8)"],[1,"should curse. We will repeat the       sorrowful cry of Israel and the complaints against the persecutions       which are directed against us. Then, even though each individual       may be against us, the masses, in their stupidity, will always be       for us. With the press in our hands, we can turn wrong into right,       dishonesty into honesty. We can shake all foundations, and separate       families. We can destroy faith in all that our enemies, until now,       have believed. We can ruin credits and arouse passions. We can       declare war; we can award fame or disgrace. We can uplift or ruin       talent.         \"'When Israel shall have gold and the press in his hands, we will       be able to ask: \"On what day will it please you to _put on Atarah_       (crown) which belongs to us by right, to erect Shisse (?) and       extend the Shebet (sceptre) over the nations of the earth?\"'         \"A noisy greeting followed these words and the agitated men who       listened hardly understood for some time what was being said at the       meeting. At last the voice of the Levite called upon all to be       silent.         \"'The Roshe-Bate-Aboth of the twelve tribes have uttered words of       wisdom. These words will be as pillars for the times to come, if       the son of him \"who has not rest\" will write these words upon his       memory and spread the seeds among the nation of Israel in order       that it may grow to be a mighty tree. They will be the sword with       which Israel will strike down his enemies. Our posterity must share       among themselves happiness, wealth and power as it shared       misfortune and dangers. They must help one another. Wherever one of       them places his foot, he must drag another--his brother--along with       him. If one of them is unfortunate, others must help him, if he but       lives according to the law of our nation.         \"'He who was in prison for ten years, may become a rich man to whom       princes will bow, if only our people will not forsake him. Where       everybody is against us, all will be for us. After forty years of       wandering in the desert, the hand of Jehovah brought us to power in       the land of Canaan; the same hand will lead us after forty-five       times forty years from our misfortune and miseries to rule over       lands which are forty-five times vaster than Canaan. If Israel       shall obey the decision here adopted by the Sanhedrin of the       Caballah, our grandchildren, coming a hundred years hence to the       grave of the founder of our union, will announce to him that they       have indeed become the princes of the world and that the promise       made to the nation of Israel has been fulfilled. Other nations will       become his slaves! Renew our oath, sons of the golden calf, and go       to all lands of the world.'         \"The blue flame flared up brightly upon the grave of the Rabbi;       each of the thirteen threw upon the tomb a stone which each carried       under his cloak.         \"It seemed to the doctor that on the top of the tombstone, in the       bluish flame, there appeared a monstrous golden figure of an       animal.         \"Then he heard the same metallic sound that he had heard when the       light first appeared. Then impenetrable darkness covered the       cemetery.         \"The white figures again slipped by among the tombstones. The gates       creaked softly.         \"The clock in the tower struck two past midnight. The last of the       mysterious visitors knocked at the window and a hoarse voice said       (as though the speaker knew that the watchman was not asleep):         \"'Close the house of life, watchman of those who are awaiting the       resurrection, and may your lips be sealed with the seal of Solomon       for a hundred years.'         \"The scholar still lay motionless; he was afraid to stir; all he       had heard had made upon him such a dreadful impression.         \"A noise near him indicated that his companion was rising.         \"'To concentrate in their hands all the capital of the nations of       all lands; to secure possession of all the land, railroads, mines,       houses; to be at the head of all organizations, to occupy the       highest governmental posts, to paralyze commerce and industry       everywhere, to seize the press, to direct legislation, public       opinion and national movements--and all for the purpose of       subjugating all nations on earth to their power!

My promise is fulfilled; but remember your vow--be silent       as to all that you have heard and seen here!'\"    This is the weird, fantastic \"thriller\" from which sprang the Protocols.  It is the first stage. According to this story not only were there  present at a secret meeting in the Prague Cemetery, the representatives  of the twelve tribes of Israel, ten of which totally disappeared nearly  twenty-five centuries ago, but also the son of \"the accursed one,\" the  Devil, was there, making side-remarks from time to time. His assigned  function was that of spreading the decisions of the Wise Men of Zion  among the Jews in order that they conquer the world.    Dr. Herman L. Strack, professor of theology at the University of Berlin,  one of the foremost Christian authorities on theological and religious  literature, commenting on this Goedsche-Retcliffe concoction, says that  this tale of the ghostly convocation in the Jewish cemetery at Prague,  discloses no real knowledge of Judaism, that the reference to mixed  marriages indicates gross ignorance of actual Jewish thought, and that  the Hebrew words supposed to have been employed by the spokesmen for the  various tribes appear to have been borrowed from a dictionary. He also  points to Goedsche-Retcliffe's story and the \"Rabbi's Speech\" about to  be mentioned as the sources of the Protocols.

A number of years after this Russian translation of the  Goedsche-Retcliffe story appeared, Sir John Retcliffe, alias Goedsche,  deeming it important for his purpose of adding fuel to the flame of  anti-semitism that had been lighted in Germany, undertook to convert  this work of fiction, this offspring of his imagination, into a  statement of fact. This led him to adopt the simple device of  consolidating into one continuous speech the dialogue contained in his  shilling shocker, and putting the speech into the mouth of an imaginary  Rabbi in such a way as to make it appear to be an address delivered by  him to a secret convocation of Jews. And the very man who had invented  the speeches set down in his work of fiction twenty years before, now  vouched for the authenticity of the obviously fabricated speech which he  attributed to a Rabbi who had his birth in the contorted mind of this  notorious forger.    A translation from the Russian of the apocryphal \"Rabbi's Speech,\" with  the introductory note as published in Russia by G. Butmi, in 1907, in a  book entitled \"The Enemy of the Human Race,\" dedicated by the author to  the Black Hundreds, will now be laid before the reader. A comparison of  it, with the scene in the cemetery, will at once demonstrate the  identity of authorship.
