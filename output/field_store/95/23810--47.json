(This refers to the fact that the tonic       is the principal tone, or generating tone of the key, _i.e._,       it is _the_ tone.)         2. _Super-tonic_--above the tone.         3. _Mediant_--midway between tonic and dominant.         4. _Sub-dominant_--the under dominant. (This name does not       refer to the position of the tone under the dominant but to       the fact that the fifth below the tonic is also a dominant       tone--the under dominant--just as the fifth above is the upper       dominant).         5. _Dominant_--the governing tone. (From the Latin word       _dominus_ meaning _master_.)         6. _Super-dominant_--above the dominant. Or       _Sub-mediant_--midway between tonic and sub-dominant.         7. _Leading tone_--the tone which demands resolution to the       tonic (one-half step above it).         8. _Octave_--the eighth tone.    92. The syllables commonly applied to the various major and minor scales  in teaching sight-singing are as follows:[16]    [Footnote 16: These syllables are said to have been derived originally  from the initial syllables of the \"Hymn to Saint John,\" the music of  which was a typical Gregorian chant. The application of these syllables  to the scale tones will be made clear by reference to this hymn as given  below. It will be observed that this hymn provided syllables only for  the six tones of the _hexachord_ then recognized; when the octave scale  was adopted (early in the sixteenth century) the initial letters of the  last line (s and i) were combined into a syllable for the seventh tone.    [Illustration: _Ut_ que-ant lax-is _Re_-so-na-re fi-bris _Mi_-ra  ges-to-rum _Fa_-mu-li tu-o-rum _Sol_-ve pol-lu-ti _La_-bi-i re-a-tum  Sanc-te Jo-han-nes.]]    Major--DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, TI, DO.    Minor[17]--original--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA.             harmonic--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FA, SI, LA.             melodic--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FI, SI, LA,               SOL, FA, MI, RE, DO, TI, LA.    [Footnote 17: A considerable number of teachers (particularly those who  did not learn to sing by syllable in childhood) object to calling the  tonic of the minor scale _la_, insisting that both major and minor tonic  should be called _do_. According to this plan the syllables used in  singing the harmonic minor scale would be: DO, RE, ME, FA, SOL, LE, TI,  DO.    There is no particular basis for this theory, for although all scales  must of course begin with the key-tone or tonic, this tonic may be  referred to by any syllable which will serve as a basis for an  association process enabling one to feel the force of the tone as a  closing point--a _home tone_. Thus in the Dorian mode the tonic would be  RE, in the Phrygian, MI, etc.]         It is interesting to study the changes in both spelling and       pronunciation that have occurred (and are still occurring) in       these syllables. The first one (ut) was changed to _DO_ as       early as the sixteenth century because of the difficulty of       producing a good singing tone on _ut_. For the same reason and       also in order to avoid having two diatonic syllables with the       same initial letter, the tonic-sol-fa system (invented in       England about 1812 and systematized about 1850) changed SI to       TI and this change has been almost universally adopted by       teachers of sight-singing in this country. The more elaborate       tonic-sol-fa spelling of the diatonic syllables (DOH, LAH,       etc.), has not, however, been favorably received in this       country and the tendency seems to be toward still further       simplification rather than toward elaboration. It is probable       that further changes in both spelling and pronunciation will       be made in the near future, one such change that seems       especially desirable being some other syllable than RE for the       second tone of the major scale, so that the present syllable       may be reserved for \"flat-two,\" thus providing a uniform       vowel-sound for all intermediate tones of the descending       chromatic scale, as is already the case in the ascending form.    93. The _chromatic scale_[18] is one which proceeds always by  half-steps. Its intervals are therefore always equal no matter with what  tone it begins. Since, however, we have (from the standpoint of the  piano keyboard) five pairs of tones[19] which are enharmonically the  same, it may readily be seen that the chromatic scale might be notated  in all sorts of fashions, and this is in fact the real status of the  matter, there being no one method uniformly agreed upon by composers.    [Footnote 18: The student should differentiate between the so-called  \"tonality\" scales like the major and minor, the tones of which are  actually used as a basis for \"key-feeling\" with the familiar experience  of coming home to the tonic after a melodic or harmonic excursion, and  on the other hand the purely artificial and mechanical construction of  the chromatic scale.]    [Footnote 19: Many other enharmonic notations are possible, altho the  \"five pairs of tones\" above referred to are the most common. Thus  E[sharp] and F are enharmonically the same, as are also C[flat] and B,  C[sharp] and B[double-sharp], etc.]         Parry (Grove's Dictionary, article _chromatic_) recommends       writing the scale with such accidentals as can occur in       chromatic chords without changing the key in which the passage       occurs. Thus, taking C as a type, \"the first accidental will       be D[flat], as the upper note of the minor ninth on the tonic;       the next will be E[flat], the minor third of the key; the next       F[sharp], the major third of the super-tonic--all of which can       occur without causing modulation--and the remaining two will       be A[flat] and B[flat], the minor sixth and seventh of the       key.\" According to this plan the chromatic scale beginning       with C would be spelled--C, D[flat], D, E[flat], E, F,       F[sharp], G, A[flat], A, B[flat], B, C--the form being the       same both ascending and descending. This is of course written       exclusively from a harmonic standpoint and the advantage of       such a form is its definiteness.    94. For _sight-singing purposes_ the chromatic scale[20] is usually  written by representing the intermediate tones in ascending by sharps,  (in some cases naturals and double-sharps), and the intermediate tones  in descending by flats (sometimes naturals and double-flats). The  chromatic scale in nine different positions, written from this  standpoint, follows, and the syllables most commonly applied in  sight-singing have also been added. In the first two scales the student  of harmony is asked to note that because of the very common practice of  modulating to the dominant and sub-dominant keys, the intermediate tones  [sharp]4 and [flat]7 are quite universally used in both ascending and  descending melody passages. In other words the scales that follow would  more nearly represent actual usage if in each case [sharp]4 (FI) were  substituted for [flat]5 (SE) in the descending scale; and if [flat]7  (TE) were substituted for [sharp]6 (LI) in the ascending form.    [Footnote 20: The word _chromatic_ means literally _colored_ and was  first applied to the intermediate tones because by using them the singer  could get smoother and more diversely-shaded progressions, _i.e._, could  get more _color_ than by using only the diatonic tones. Composers were  not long discovering the peculiar value of these additional tones and  soon found that these same tones were exceedingly valuable also in  modulating, hence the two uses of intermediate tones at the present  time--first, to embellish a melody; second, to modulate to another key.]    [Illustration]         _Note._--In writing chromatic scales from this sight-singing       standpoint the student is urged to adopt a three-step process;       first, writing the major diatonic scale both ascending and       descending; second, marking the half-steps; third, inserting       accidental notes calling for the intermediate tones. In the       above chromatic scales these intermediate tones have been       represented by black note-heads so as to differentiate them       from the notes representing diatonic scale tones.    95. The _whole-step scale_ (the third type mentioned in Sec. 79) is, as  its name implies, a scale in which the intervals between the tones  consist in every instance of whole-steps. This reduces the number of  tones in the scale to seven. Beginning with C the scale reads: C, D, E,  F[sharp] or G[flat], A[flat], B[flat], C. This scale has been used  somewhat extensively by the ultramodern French school of composition  represented by Debussy, Ravel, and others, but is not making any  progress toward universal adoption. The remarks of a recent English  writer[21] on this subject may be interesting to the student who is  puzzled by the apparent present-day tendencies of French music. He says:         \"The student of some interesting modern developments will also       speedily discover that the adoption of the so-called       whole-tone scale as a basis of music is, except upon a keyed       instrument tuned to the compromise of equal temperament,       unnatural and impossible. No player upon a stringed instrument       can play the scale of whole-tones and arrive at an octave       which is in tune with the starting note, unless he       deliberately changes one of the notes on the road and alters       it while playing it. The obvious result of the application of       the whole-tone scale to an orchestra or a string quartet would       be to force them to adopt the equal temperament of the       pianoforte, and play every interval except the octave out of       tune. When this modification had taken hold all music in the       pure scale would be distorted and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#8)"],[1,"these the most formidable are the vast  reptiles, of some of which antediluvian relics are preserved in our  museums, and certain gigantic winged creatures, half bird, half reptile.  These, together with lesser wild animals, corresponding to our tigers  or venomous serpents, it is left to the younger children to hunt and  destroy; because, according to the Ana, here ruthlessness is wanted,  and the younger the child the more ruthlessly he will destroy. There is  another class of animals in the destruction of which discrimination  is to be used, and against which children of intermediate age are  appointed--animals that do not threaten the life of man, but ravage the  produce of his labour, varieties of the elk and deer species, and  a smaller creature much akin to our rabbit, though infinitely more  destructive to crops, and much more cunning in its mode of depredation.  It is the first object of these appointed infants, to tame the more  intelligent of such animals into respect for enclosures signalised by  conspicuous landmarks, as dogs are taught to respect a larder, or even  to guard the master's property. It is only where such creatures are  found untamable to this extent that they are destroyed. Life is never  taken away for food or for sport, and never spared where untamably  inimical to the Ana. Concomitantly with these bodily services and tasks,  the mental education of the children goes on till boyhood ceases. It is  the general custom, then, to pass though a course of instruction at  the College of Sages, in which, besides more general studies, the pupil  receives special lessons in such vocation or direction of intellect  as he himself selects. Some, however, prefer to pass this period of  probation in travel, or to emigrate, or to settle down at once  into rural or commercial pursuits. No force is put upon individual  inclination.        Chapter X.      The word Ana (pronounced broadly 'Arna') corresponds with our plural  'men;' An (pronounced 'Arn'), the singular, with 'man.' The word for  woman is Gy (pronounced hard, as in Guy); it forms itself into Gy-ei for  the plural, but the G becomes soft in the plural like Jy-ei. They have  a proverb to the effect that this difference in pronunciation is  symbolical, for that the female sex is soft in the concrete, but hard to  deal with in the individual. The Gy-ei are in the fullest enjoyment of  all the rights of equality with males, for which certain philosophers  above ground contend.    In childhood they perform the offices of work and labour impartially  with the boys, and, indeed, in the earlier age appropriated to the  destruction of animals irreclaimably hostile, the girls are frequently  preferred, as being by constitution more ruthless under the influence of  fear or hate. In the interval between infancy and the marriageable age  familiar intercourse between the sexes is suspended. At the marriageable  age it is renewed, never with worse consequences than those which attend  upon marriage. All arts and vocations allotted to the one sex are open  to the other, and the Gy-ei arrogate to themselves a superiority in all  those abstruse and mystical branches of reasoning, for which they say  the Ana are unfitted by a duller sobriety of understanding, or the  routine of their matter-of-fact occupations, just as young ladies in our  own world constitute themselves authorities in the subtlest points of  theological doctrine, for which few men, actively engaged in worldly  business have sufficient learning or refinement of intellect.  Whether owing to early training in gymnastic exercises, or to their  constitutional organisation, the Gy-ei are usually superior to the Ana  in physical strength (an important element in the consideration and  maintenance of female rights). They attain to loftier stature, and amid  their rounder proportions are imbedded sinews and muscles as hardy  as those of the other sex. Indeed they assert that, according to the  original laws of nature, females were intended to be larger than males,  and maintain this dogma by reference to the earliest formations of life  in insects, and in the most ancient family of the vertebrata--viz.,  fishes--in both of which the females are generally large enough to make  a meal of their consorts if they so desire. Above all, the Gy-ei have a  readier and more concentred power over that mysterious fluid or agency  which contains the element of destruction, with a larger portion of that  sagacity which comprehends dissimulation. Thus they cannot only defend  themselves against all aggressions from the males, but could, at any  moment when he least expected his danger, terminate the existence of an  offending spouse. To the credit of the Gy-ei no instance of their abuse  of this awful superiority in the art of destruction is on record for  several ages. The last that occurred in the community I speak of appears  (according to their chronology) to have been about two thousand years  ago. A Gy, then, in a fit of jealousy, slew her husband; and this  abominable act inspired such terror among the males that they emigrated  in a body and left all the Gy-ei to themselves. The history runs that  the widowed Gy-ei, thus reduced to despair, fell upon the murderess when  in her sleep (and therefore unarmed), and killed her, and then entered  into a solemn obligation amongst themselves to abrogate forever the  exercise of their extreme conjugal powers, and to inculcate the  same obligation for ever and ever on their female children. By this  conciliatory process, a deputation despatched to the fugitive consorts  succeeded in persuading many to return, but those who did return were  mostly the elder ones. The younger, either from too craven a doubt of  their consorts, or too high an estimate of their own merits, rejected  all overtures, and, remaining in other communities, were caught up there  by other mates, with whom perhaps they were no better off. But the loss  of so large a portion of the male youth operated as a salutary warning  on the Gy-ei, and confirmed them in the pious resolution to which they  pledged themselves. Indeed it is now popularly considered that, by long  hereditary disuse, the Gy-ei have lost both the aggressive and defensive  superiority over the Ana which they once possessed, just as in the  inferior animals above the earth many peculiarities in their original  formation, intended by nature for their protection, gradually fade or  become inoperative when not needed under altered circumstances. I should  be sorry, however, for any An who induced a Gy to make the experiment  whether he or she were the stronger.    From the incident I have narrated, the Ana date certain alterations in  the marriage customs, tending, perhaps, somewhat to the advantage of the  male. They now bind themselves in wedlock only for three years; at the  end of each third year either male or female can divorce the other and  is free to marry again. At the end of ten years the An has the privilege  of taking a second wife, allowing the first to retire if she so please.  These regulations are for the most part a dead letter; divorces and  polygamy are extremely rare, and the marriage state now seems  singularly happy and serene among this astonishing people;--the Gy-ei,  notwithstanding their boastful superiority in physical strength and  intellectual abilities, being much curbed into gentle manners by the  dread of separation or of a second wife, and the Ana being very much the  creatures of custom, and not, except under great aggravation, likely  to exchange for hazardous novelties faces and manners to which they  are reconciled by habit. But there is one privilege the Gy-ei carefully  retain, and the desire for which perhaps forms the secret motive of most  lady asserters of woman rights above ground. They claim the privilege,  here usurped by men, of proclaiming their love and urging their suit;  in other words, of being the wooing party rather than the wooed. Such a  phenomenon as an old maid does not exist among the Gy-ei. Indeed it  is very seldom that a Gy does not secure any An upon whom she sets her  heart, if his affections be not strongly engaged elsewhere. However coy,  reluctant, and prudish, the male she courts may prove at first, yet her  perseverance, her ardour, her persuasive powers, her command over the  mystic agencies of vril, are pretty sure to run down his neck into  what we call \"the fatal noose.\" Their argument for the reversal of that  relationship of the sexes which the blind tyranny of man has established  on the surface of the earth, appears cogent, and is advanced with a  frankness which might well be commended to impartial consideration.  They say, that of the two the female is by nature of a more loving  disposition than the male--that love occupies a larger space in her  thoughts, and is more essential to her happiness, and that therefore  she ought to be the wooing party; that otherwise the male is a shy and  dubitant creature--that he has often a selfish predilection for the  single state--that he often pretends to misunderstand tender glances  and delicate hints--that, in short, he must be resolutely pursued and  captured. They add, moreover, that unless the Gy can secure the An of  her choice, and one whom she would not select out of the whole world  becomes her mate, she is not only less happy than she otherwise would  be, but she is not so good a being, that her qualities of heart are not  sufficiently developed; whereas the An is a creature that less lastingly  concentrates his affections on one object; that if he cannot get the  Gy whom he prefers he easily reconciles himself to another Gy; and,  finally, that at the worst, if he is loved and taken care of, it is less  necessary to the welfare of his existence that he should love as well  as be loved; he grows contented with his creature comforts, and the many  occupations of thought which he creates for himself.
