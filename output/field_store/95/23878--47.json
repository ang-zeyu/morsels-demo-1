I can hear them now.       Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad refrain?      Don't you remember that last good-by, and the dear eyes dim with tears?     Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,      Of lives that would blend like an angel-song        in the bliss of the coming years?       Oh, what have I lost!  What have I lost!  Ethel, forgive, forgive!      The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.     'Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live!      I have sinned, I have sunk to the lowest depths --        but oh, I have suffered so!       Hark!  Oh, hark!  I can hear the bells!...  Look! I can see her there,      Fair as a dream... but it fades... And now --        I can hear the dreadful hum     Of the crowded court... See! the Judge looks down...       _NOT GUILTY_, my Lord, I swear...      The bells -- I can hear the bells again!...  Ethel, I come, I come!...            *    *    *    *    *       \"Rouse up, old man, it's twelve o'clock.  You can't sleep here, you know.      Say! ain't you got no sentiment?  Lift up your muddled head;     Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go --      You darned old dirty hobo... My God!  Here, boys!  He's _DEAD!_\"          Comfort           Say!  You've struck a heap of trouble --      Bust in business, lost your wife;     No one cares a cent about you,      You don't care a cent for life;     Hard luck has of hope bereft you,      Health is failing, wish you'd die --     Why, you've still the sunshine left you      And the big, blue sky.       Sky so blue it makes you wonder      If it's heaven shining through;     Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,      Sun so bright it dazzles you;     Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging      All their fragrance on the breeze;     Dancing shadows, green, still meadows --      Don't you mope, you've still got these.       These, and none can take them from you;      These, and none can weigh their worth.     What! you're tired and broke and beaten? --      Why, you're rich -- you've got the earth!     Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,      While the blue sky bends above     You've got nearly all that matters --      You've got God, and God is love.          The Harpy                There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she;          She was old, so old, yet her years all told were but a score and three;          And she knew by heart, from finish to start, the Book of Iniquity.       There is no hope for such as I on earth, nor yet in Heaven;     Unloved I live, unloved I die, unpitied, unforgiven;     A loathed jade, I ply my trade, unhallowed and unshriven.       I paint my cheeks, for they are white, and cheeks of chalk men hate;     Mine eyes with wine I make them shine, that man may seek and sate;     With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait       Until they come, the nightly scum, with drunken eyes aflame;     Your sweethearts, sons, ye scornful ones -- 'tis I who know their shame.     The gods, ye see, are brutes to me -- and so I play my game.       For life is not the thing we thought, and not the thing we plan;     And Woman in a bitter world must do the best she can --     Must yield the stroke, and bear the yoke, and serve the will of man;       Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire,     Though be she loved for love alone, or be she loved for hire;     For every man since life began is tainted with the mire.       And though you know he love you so and set you on love's throne;     Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs, and let your heart be stone,     Lest you be left (as I was left) attainted and alone.       From love's close kiss to hell's abyss is one sheer flight, I trow,     And wedding ring and bridal bell are will-o'-wisps of woe,     And 'tis not wise to love too well, and this all women know.       Wherefore, the wolf-pack having gorged upon the lamb, their prey,     With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolf-pack pay --     With velvet paws and flensing claws, a tigress roused to slay.       One who in youth sought truest truth and found a devil's lies;     A symbol of the sin of man, a human sacrifice.     Yet shall I blame on man the shame?  Could it be otherwise?       Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride?     The Maker marred, and, evil-starred, I drift upon His tide;     And He alone shall judge His own, so I His judgment bide.            Fate has written a tragedy; its name is \"The Human Heart\".          The Theatre is the House of Life, Woman the mummer's part;          The Devil enters the prompter's box and the play is ready to start.          Premonition           'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright      (Oh, I remember so well, so well);     I walked with my love in a sea of light,      And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell.         And sudden the moon grew strangely dull,          And sudden my love had taken wing;         I looked on the face of a grinning skull,          I strained to my heart a ghastly thing.       'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still      In my arms, with her tender eyes aglow,     And she wondered why my lips were chill,      Why I was silent and kissed her so.         A year has gone and the moon is bright,          A gibbous moon, like a ghost of woe;         I sit by a new-made grave to-night,          And my heart is broken -- it's strange, you know.          The Tramps           Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped God's land together,      And we sang the old, old Earth-song, for our youth was very sweet;     When we drank and fought and lusted, as we mocked at tie and tether,      Along the road to Anywhere, the wide world at our feet --       Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had its story;      When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest was still unstale;     When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as, bathed in amber glory,      Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale?       Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster;      There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet O we loved it so!     As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was our master,      And no man guessed what dreams were ours, as, swinging heel and toe,     We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic road to Anywhere,      The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years ago.

Jean lost  nothing of this.  How glad he was that he had tarried in San Francisco  because of a mental picture of this very reception in far-off wild  Arizona.    When Guy deposited the bundle on the floor it jarred the room. It gave  forth metallic and rattling and crackling sounds.    \"Everybody stand back an' give me elbow room,\" ordered Jean,  majestically.  \"My good folks, I want you all to know this is somethin'  that doesn't happen often.  The bundle you see here weighed about a  hundred pounds when I packed it on my shoulder down Market Street in  Frisco.  It was stolen from me on shipboard. I got it back in San Diego  an' licked the thief.  It rode on a burro from San Diego to Yuma an'  once I thought the burro was lost for keeps. It came up the Colorado  River from Yuma to Ehrenberg an' there went on top of a stage.  We got  chased by bandits an' once when the horses were gallopin' hard it near  rolled off.  Then it went on the back of a pack horse an' helped wear  him out.  An' I reckon it would be somewhere else now if I hadn't  fallen in with a freighter goin' north from Phoenix to the Santa Fe  Trail.  The last lap when it sagged the back of a mule was the riskiest  an' full of the narrowest escapes. Twice my mule bucked off his pack  an' left my outfit scattered. Worst of all, my precious bundle made the  mule top heavy comin' down that place back here where the trail seems  to drop off the earth. There I was hard put to keep sight of my pack.  Sometimes it was on top an' other times the mule.  But it got here at  last.... An' now I'll open it.\"    After this long and impressive harangue, which at least augmented the  suspense of the women and worked the children into a frenzy, Jean  leisurely untied the many knots round the bundle and unrolled it. He  had packed that bundle for just such travel as it had sustained. Three  cloth-bound rifles he laid aside, and with them a long, very heavy  package tied between two thin wide boards.  From this came the metallic  clink.  \"Oo, I know what dem is!\" cried Lee, breaking the silence of  suspense.  Then Jean, tearing open a long flat parcel, spread before  the mute, rapt-eyed youngsters such magnificent things, as they had  never dreamed of--picture books, mouth-harps, dolls, a toy gun and a  toy pistol, a wonderful whistle and a fox horn, and last of all a box  of candy.  Before these treasures on the floor, too magical to be  touched at first, the two little boys and their sister simply knelt.  That was a sweet, full moment for Jean; yet even that was clouded by  the something which shadowed these innocent children fatefully born in  a wild place at a wild time.  Next Jean gave to his sister the presents  he had brought her--beautiful cloth for a dress, ribbons and a bit of  lace, handkerchiefs and buttons and yards of linen, a sewing case and a  whole box of spools of thread, a comb and brush and mirror, and lastly  a Spanish brooch inlaid with garnets.  \"There, Ann,\" said Jean, \"I  confess I asked a girl friend in Oregon to tell me some things my  sister might like.\"  Manifestly there was not much difference in girls.  Ann seemed stunned by this munificence, and then awakening, she hugged  Jean in a way that took his breath.  She was not a child any more, that  was certain.  Aunt Mary turned knowing eyes upon Jean.  \"Reckon you  couldn't have pleased Ann more.  She's engaged, Jean, an' where girls  are in that state these things mean a heap.... Ann, you'll be married  in that!\"  And she pointed to the beautiful folds of material that Ann  had spread out.    \"What's this?\" demanded Jean.  His sister's blushes were enough to  convict her, and they were mightily becoming, too.    \"Here, Aunt Mary,\" went on Jean, \"here's yours, an' here's somethin'  for each of my new sisters.\"  This distribution left the women as happy  and occupied, almost, as the children.  It left also another package,  the last one in the bundle.  Jean laid hold of it and, lifting it, he  was about to speak when he sustained a little shock of memory. Quite  distinctly he saw two little feet, with bare toes peeping out of  worn-out moccasins, and then round, bare, symmetrical ankles that had  been scratched by brush.  Next he saw Ellen Jorth's passionate face as  she looked when she had made the violent action so disconcerting to  him.  In this happy moment the memory seemed farther off than a few  hours.  It had crystallized.  It annoyed while it drew him.  As a  result he slowly laid this package aside and did not speak as he had  intended to.    \"Dad, I reckon I didn't fetch a lot for you an' the boys,\" continued  Jean.  \"Some knives, some pipes an' tobacco.  An' sure the guns.\"    \"Shore, you're a regular Santa Claus, Jean,\" replied his father. \"Wal,  wal, look at the kids.  An' look at Mary.  An' for the land's sake look  at Ann!  Wal, wal, I'm gettin' old.  I'd forgotten the pretty stuff an'  gimcracks that mean so much to women.  We're out of the world heah.  It's just as well you've lived apart from us, Jean, for comin' back  this way, with all that stuff, does us a lot of good.  I cain't say,  son, how obliged I am.  My mind has been set on the hard side of life.  An' it's shore good to forget--to see the smiles of the women an' the  joy of the kids.\"    At this juncture a tall young man entered the open door.  He looked a  rider.  All about him, even his face, except his eyes, seemed old, but  his eyes were young, fine, soft, and dark.    \"How do, y'u-all!\" he said, evenly.    Ann rose from her knees.  Then Jean did not need to be told who this  newcomer was.    \"Jean, this is my friend, Andrew Colmor.\"    Jean knew when he met Colmor's grip and the keen flash of his eyes that  he was glad Ann had set her heart upon one of their kind.  And his  second impression was something akin to the one given him in the road  by the admiring lad.  Colmor's estimate of him must have been a  monument built of Ann's eulogies.  Jean's heart suffered misgivings.  Could he live up to the character that somehow had forestalled his  advent in Grass Valley?  Surely life was measured differently here in  the Tonto Basin.    The children, bundling their treasures to their bosoms, were dragged  off to bed in some remote part of the house, from which their laughter  and voices came back with happy significance.  Jean forthwith had an  interested audience.  How eagerly these lonely pioneer people listened  to news of the outside world!  Jean talked until he was hoarse. In  their turn his hearers told him much that had never found place in the  few and short letters he had received since he had been left in Oregon.  Not a word about sheepmen or any hint of rustlers! Jean marked the  omission and thought all the more seriously of probabilities because  nothing was said.  Altogether the evening was a happy reunion of a  family of which all living members were there present.  Jean grasped  that this fact was one of significant satisfaction to his father.    \"Shore we're all goin' to live together heah,\" he declared.  \"I started  this range.  I call most of this valley mine.  We'll run up a cabin for  Ann soon as she says the word.  An' you, Jean, where's your girl? I  shore told you to fetch her.\"    \"Dad, I didn't have one,\" replied Jean.    \"Wal, I wish you had,\" returned the rancher.  \"You'll go courtin' one  of these Tonto hussies that I might object to.\"    \"Why, father, there's not a girl in the valley Jean would look twice  at,\" interposed Ann Isbel, with spirit.    Jean laughed the matter aside, but he had an uneasy memory.  Aunt Mary  averred, after the manner of relatives, that Jean would play havoc  among the women of the settlement.  And Jean retorted that at least one  member of the Isbels; should hold out against folly and fight and love  and marriage, the agents which had reduced the family to these few  present.  \"I'll be the last Isbel to go under,\" he concluded.    \"Son, you're talkin' wisdom,\" said his father.  \"An' shore that reminds  me of the uncle you're named after.  Jean Isbel! ... Wal, he was my  youngest brother an' shore a fire-eater.  Our mother was a French  creole from Louisiana, an' Jean must have inherited some of his  fightin' nature from her.  When the war of the rebellion started Jean  an' I enlisted. I was crippled before we ever got to the front.  But  Jean went through three Years before he was killed.  His company had  orders to fight to the last man.  An' Jean fought an' lived long enough  just to be that last man.\"    At length Jean was left alone with his father.    \"Reckon you're used to bunkin' outdoors?\" queried the rancher, rather  abruptly.    \"Most of the time,\" replied Jean.    \"Wal, there's room in the house, but I want you to sleep out. Come get  your beddin' an' gun. I'll show you.\"    They went outside on the porch, where Jean shouldered his roll of  tarpaulin and blankets.  His rifle, in its saddle sheath, leaned  against the door.  His father took it up and, half pulling it out,  looked at it by the starlight.  \"Forty-four, eh?  Wal, wal, there's  shore no better, if a man can hold straight.\"  At the moment a big gray  dog trotted up to sniff at Jean.  \"An' heah's your bunkmate, Shepp.  He's part lofer, Jean.  His mother was a favorite shepherd dog of mine.  His father was a big timber wolf that took us two years to kill.  Some  bad wolf packs runnin' this Basin.\"    The night was cold and still, darkly bright under moon and stars; the  smell of hay seemed to mingle with that of cedar.  Jean followed his  father round the house and up a gentle slope of grass to the edge of  the cedar line.  Here several trees with low-sweeping thick branches  formed a dense, impenetrable shade.    \"Son, your uncle Jean was scout for Liggett, one of the greatest rebels  the South had,\" said the rancher.  \"An' you're goin' to be scout for  the Isbels of Tonto.  Reckon you'll find it 'most as hot as your uncle  did.... "]]]
