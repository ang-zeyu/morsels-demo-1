[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1947"],[0,"Scaramouche: A Romance of the French Revolution (#8)"],[1,"be a warning  to you, Andre. You are, yourself, too prone to these new-fashioned  speculations upon a different constitution of the social order. You  see what comes of it. A fine, estimable young man, the only prop of  his widowed mother too, forgets himself, his position, his duty to that  mother--everything; and goes and gets himself killed like this. It is  infernally sad. On my soul it is sad.\" He produced a handkerchief, and  blew his nose with vehemence.    Andre-Louis felt a tightening of his heart, a lessening of the hopes,  never too sanguine, which he had founded upon his godfather.    \"Your criticisms,\" he said, \"are all for the conduct of the dead, and  none for that of the murderer. It does not seem possible that you should  be in sympathy with such a crime.\"    \"Crime?\" shrilled M. de Kercadiou. \"My God, boy, you are speaking of M.  de La Tour d'Azyr.\"    \"I am, and of the abominable murder he has committed...\"    \"Stop!\" M. de Kercadiou was very emphatic. \"I cannot permit that you  apply such terms to him. I cannot permit it. M. le Marquis is my friend,  and is likely very soon to stand in a still closer relationship.\"    \"Notwithstanding this?\" asked Andre-Louis.    M. de Kercadiou was frankly impatient.    \"Why, what has this to do with it? I may deplore it. But I have no  right to condemn it. It is a common way of adjusting differences between  gentlemen.\"    \"You really believe that?\"    \"What the devil do you imply, Andre? Should I say a thing that I don't  believe? You begin to make me angry.\"    \"'Thou shalt not kill,' is the King's law as well as God's.\"    \"You are determined to quarrel with me, I think. It was a duel...\"    Andre-Louis interrupted him. \"It is no more a duel than if it had been  fought with pistols of which only M. le Marquis's was loaded. He invited  Philippe to discuss the matter further, with the deliberate intent of  forcing a quarrel upon him and killing him. Be patient with me, monsieur  my god-father. I am not telling you of what I imagine but what M. le  Marquis himself admitted to me.\"    Dominated a little by the young man's earnestness, M. de Kercadiou's  pale eyes fell away. He turned with a shrug, and sauntered over to the  window.    \"It would need a court of honour to decide such an issue. And we have no  courts of honour,\" he said.    \"But we have courts of justice.\"    With returning testiness the seigneur swung round to face him again.  \"And what court of justice, do you think, would listen to such a plea as  you appear to have in mind?\"    \"There is the court of the King's Lieutenant at Rennes.\"    \"And do you think the King's Lieutenant would listen to you?\"    \"Not to me, perhaps, Monsieur. But if you were to bring the plaint...\"    \"I bring the plaint?\" M. de Kercadiou's pale eyes were wide with horror  of the suggestion.    \"The thing happened here on your domain.\"    \"I bring a plaint against M. de La Tour d'Azyr! You are out of your  senses, I think. Oh, you are mad; as mad as that poor friend of yours  who has come to this end through meddling in what did not concern him.  The language he used here to M. le Marquis on the score of Mabey was  of the most offensive. Perhaps you didn't know that. It does not at all  surprise me that the Marquis should have desired satisfaction.\"    \"I see,\" said Andre-Louis, on a note of hopelessness.    \"You see? What the devil do you see?\"    \"That I shall have to depend upon myself alone.\"    \"And what the devil do you propose to do, if you please?\"    \"I shall go to Rennes, and lay the facts before the King's Lieutenant.\"    \"He'll be too busy to see you.\" And M. de Kercadiou's mind swung a  trifle inconsequently, as weak minds will. \"There is trouble enough in  Rennes already on the score of these crazy States General, with which  the wonderful M. Necker is to repair the finances of the kingdom. As  if a peddling Swiss bank-clerk, who is also a damned Protestant, could  succeed where such men as Calonne and Brienne have failed.\"    \"Good-afternoon, monsieur my godfather,\" said Andre-Louis.    \"Where are you going?\" was the querulous demand.    \"Home at present. To Rennes in the morning.\"    \"Wait, boy, wait!\" The squat little man rolled forward, affectionate  concern on his great ugly face, and he set one of his podgy hands on  his godson's shoulder. \"Now listen to me, Andre,\" he reasoned. \"This is  sheer knight-errantry--moonshine, lunacy. You'll come to no good by it if  you persist. You've read 'Don Quixote,' and what happened to him when  he went tilting against windmills. It's what will happen to you, neither  more nor less. Leave things as they are, my boy. I wouldn't have a  mischief happen to you.\"    Andre-Louis looked at him, smiling wanly.    \"I swore an oath to-day which it would damn my soul to break.\"    \"You mean that you'll go in spite of anything that I may say?\" Impetuous  as he was inconsequent, M. de Kercadiou was bristling again. \"Very well,  then, go... Go to the devil!\"    \"I will begin with the King's Lieutenant.\"    \"And if you get into the trouble you are seeking, don't come whimpering  to me for assistance,\" the seigneur stormed. He was very angry now.  \"Since you choose to disobey me, you can break your empty head against  the windmill, and be damned to you.\"    Andre-Louis bowed with a touch of irony, and reached the door.    \"If the windmill should prove too formidable,\" said he, from the  threshold, \"I may see what can be done with the wind. Good-bye, monsieur  my godfather.\"    He was gone, and M. de Kercadiou was alone, purple in the face, puzzling  out that last cryptic utterance, and not at all happy in his mind,  either on the score of his godson or of M. de La Tour d'Azyr. He was  disposed to be angry with them both. He found these headstrong, wilful  men who relentlessly followed their own impulses very disturbing and  irritating. Himself he loved his ease, and to be at peace with his  neighbours; and that seemed to him so obviously the supreme good of life  that he was disposed to brand them as fools who troubled to seek other  things.            CHAPTER VI. THE WINDMILL    There was between Nantes and Rennes an established service of three  stage-coaches weekly in each direction, which for a sum of twenty-four  livres--roughly, the equivalent of an English guinea--would carry you the  seventy and odd miles of the journey in some fourteen hours. Once a week  one of the diligences going in each direction would swerve aside  from the highroad to call at Gavrillac, to bring and take letters,  newspapers, and sometimes passengers. It was usually by this coach  that Andre-Louis came and went when the occasion offered. At present,  however, he was too much in haste to lose a day awaiting the passing of  that diligence. So it was on a horse hired from the Breton arme that he  set out next morning; and an hour's brisk ride under a grey wintry sky,  by a half-ruined road through ten miles of flat, uninteresting country,  brought him to the city of Rennes.    He rode across the main bridge over the Vilaine, and so into the upper  and principal part of that important city of some thirty thousand  souls, most of whom, he opined from the seething, clamant crowds that  everywhere blocked his way, must on this day have taken to the streets.  Clearly Philippe had not overstated the excitement prevailing there.    He pushed on as best he could, and so came at last to the Place Royale,  where he found the crowd to be most dense. From the plinth of the  equestrian statue of Louis XV, a white-faced young man was excitedly  addressing the multitude. His youth and dress proclaimed the student,  and a group of his fellows, acting as a guard of honour to him, kept the  immediate precincts of the statue.    Over the heads of the crowd Andre-Louis caught a few of the phrases  flung forth by that eager voice.    \"It was the promise of the King... It is the King's authority they  flout... They arrogate to themselves the whole sovereignty in Brittany.  The King has dissolved them... These insolent nobles defying their  sovereign and the people...\"    Had he not known already, from what Philippe had told him, of the events  which had brought the Third Estate to the point of active revolt, those  few phrases would fully have informed him. This popular display of  temper was most opportune to his need, he thought. And in the hope that  it might serve his turn by disposing to reasonableness the mind of the  King's Lieutenant, he pushed on up the wide and well-paved Rue Royale,  where the concourse of people began to diminish. He put up his hired  horse at the Come de Cerf, and set out again, on foot, to the Palais de  Justice.    There was a brawling mob by the framework of poles and scaffoldings  about the building cathedral, upon which work had been commenced a year  ago. But he did not pause to ascertain the particular cause of that  gathering. He strode on, and thus came presently to the handsome  Italianate palace that was one of the few public edifices that had  survived the devastating fire of sixty years ago.    He won through with difficulty to the great hall, known as the Salle  des Pas Perdus, where he was left to cool his heels for a full half-hour  after he had found an usher so condescending as to inform the god who  presided over that shrine of Justice that a lawyer from Gavrillac humbly  begged an audience on an affair of gravity.    That the god condescended to see him at all was probably due to the  grave complexion of the hour. At long length he was escorted up the  broad stone staircase, and ushered into a spacious, meagrely furnished  anteroom, to make one of a waiting crowd of clients, mostly men.    There he spent another half-hour, and employed the time in considering  exactly what he should say. This consideration made him realize the  weakness of the case he proposed to set before a man whose views of law  and morality were coloured by his social rank.    At last he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#8)"],[1,"sum paid by the Chapter in accordance  with their agreement was only L1500. The same firm, the Skidmore Art  Company, who made it, also supplied the large corona and gasfittings.    A brass eagle presented by the Misses Rushort to the Cathedral, is placed  near the south-west corner of the screen; it was designed by Cottingham.    *The Central Tower.*--Immediately above the four great arches of the  central tower, the interior walls are, says Professor Willis in his report  on the Cathedral, \"Of a very singular construction; twelve piers of  compact masonry on each side, beside angle piers, are carried up to the  height of 26 ft., and connected half-way up by a horizontal course of  stone, in long pieces, and by an iron bar, which runs all round  immediately under this bonding course. Upon these gigantic stone gratings,  if I may be allowed the expression, the interior wall of the tower rests,  and they also carry the entire weight of the bell-chamber and bells.    The whole space is now completely open from the floor of the Cathedral to  the wooden floor of the bell-chamber, which is painted underneath in blue  and gold. From this floor hangs, the handsome corona of wrought iron.    Before Mr. Cottingham's restoration was commenced in 1843, however, the  whole appearance of the central tower was different, and the beautiful  lantern with its many shafts was hidden from view by a vault of the  fifteenth century, which rose above the great arches and completely  concealed the upper portion of the tower.    In his specific report of the condition of the central tower in  particular, which he was instructed to deliver in writing, Mr. Cottingham  said:    \"To enable me to form the opinion which I have now the honour of  reporting, I have carefully examined the construction of the four great  piers which support the tower; they are of Norman workmanship, and  sufficient in bulk to carry a much greater weight than the present tower,  had the masonry been more carefully constructed; they consist of a series  of semi-circular columns attached to a thin ashlar casing, which surrounds  the piers, and the chambers or cavities within are filled with a rubble  core, composed of broken stones, loam and lime grouting; this was  undoubtedly sufficient to carry a low Norman tower, but when the great  Early English shaft was added on the top of this work the pressure became  too great for such kind of masonry to bear. The ashlar and semi-columns,  not being well bonded and deeply headed into the rubble cores, split and  bulged, and the cores, for want of a proper proportion of lime, diminished  and crushed to pieces. To remedy these defects, a second facing of ashlar  has been attached to the piers, in some places by cutting out a part of  the old ashlar, and in others by merely fixing long slips of stone round  the pier with iron plugs, run in with lead,--these most unsightly  excrescences have destroyed the beauty of the original design, without  adding any strength to the masonry. The same unskilful hands blocked up  all the original Norman arches, except one, connected with the tower piers  and communicating with the aisles, choir, and transepts, leaving only a  small passage-way in each.    \"The first triforium arches in the choir and east side of the south  transept, abutting against the tower, have also been closed up with  masonry, so as to leave scarcely a trace of the rich work which lies  concealed behind it. These injudicious performances have tended to weaken  instead of strengthen the tower. The interior walls above the main arches  of the tower, up to the bases of the fifty-two pillars, which surround the  bellringers' chamber, are in a very ruinous state, particularly at the  four angles, where rude cavities, running in a diagonal direction, have  been made large enough for a man to creep in,--these unaccountable holes  have tended very much to increase the danger, as all the masonry connected  with them is drawn off its bond, and many of the stones shivered to pieces  by the enormous pressure above. The stone-work, also, above the pillars,  is drawn off at the angles just below the timber-work of the bell floor.  On the whole, I never witnessed a more awful monument of the fallibility  of human skill than the tower of Hereford Cathedral at this moment  presents.\"    In addition to the report of the architect the Chapter availed themselves,  on recommendation of the Bishop, of the opinion of Professor Willis, of  Cambridge. This gentleman, after the most minute scrutiny and  indefatigable labour, produced his elaborate and well-known report. He  essentially corroborated the architect, especially as to the general state  of the tower; and, under the strenuous exertions of Dean Merewether, the  great work of restoration was commenced. The tower contains a fine peal of  ten bells in the key of C. A new clock was erected in 1861, which strikes  the hours and quarter-hours.    *The North Transept.*--Passing through the north arch of the tower we come  into some of the most interesting parts of the Cathedral. The transept  beyond was entirely rebuilt for the reception of the shrine of Bishop  Cantilupe, when his body was removed from the Lady Chapel in 1287, after  the miracles reported at his tomb had already largely increased the  revenues of the Cathedral. The unusual shape of the arches and the fine  and effective windows of this transept render it one of the most  distinguished English specimens of the style.    [Illustration: NORTH ARCH OF CENTRAL TOWER, SHOWING MASONRY ERECTED ABOUT                                    1320.]         NORTH ARCH OF CENTRAL TOWER, SHOWING MASONRY ERECTED ABOUT 1320.      On the north is a window with triple lights on each side of a group of  banded shafts, the tracery above being formed of circles enclosing  trefoils. The heads of the lights are sharply pointed.    The west side has two lofty windows recessed inside triangular-headed  arches, which completely fill the two bays. They have three lights each,  and are exactly similar to the windows on the north side of the transept.    Surrounded by alternate shafts of sandstone and dark marble, a clustered  pier divides the eastern aisle of the transept into two bays. These shafts  have foliated capitals, and the bases have knots of foliage between them.    With the exception of one string of dog-tooth ornament the mouldings of  the main arches are plain.    Above is the interesting triforium stretching across the Norman arch  opening to the choir-aisle beyond the transept itself. There are in each  bay two pointed arches, each containing three smaller arches with foiled  headings surmounted by three open quatrefoils. The spandrels between the  arches are diapered in low relief with leaf ornament. Above, far back in  the clerestory arches, are octofoil windows with sills of over-lapping  courses, which incline forward to the string course above the triforium.    The shafts of all the windows are ringed at the angles, and the triangular  arches are of an unusual stilted shape, similar to those in the clerestory  of Worcester Cathedral on the south side of the nave. These are, however,  of later date, and may have been imitated by the Worcester architect.    The restoration of the north transept by Sir G. G. Scott was  satisfactorily carried out, and certainly improves the general effect.    *Monuments in the North Transept.*--The great north stained-glass window by  Hardman was placed there as a memorial to Archdeacon Lane-Freer who died  in 1863. Underneath this window, which is described later on in the  section devoted to stained glass, is the stone effigy of Bishop  Westfayling (died 1602). The canopy was removed by Wyatt, and the effigy  is now leaning on its side against the wall. There is an undoubted  original half-length portrait of this bishop in the Hall of Jesus College,  Oxford. There are monuments to other members of the family in the church  at Ross.    In the pavement near the choir-aisle is a brass to John Philips, the  author of _The Splendid Shilling_ and of _Cyder_, a poem endearing him to  Herefordshire. His family belonged to this county, although he himself was  born in Oxfordshire. There is also a monument to Philips in Poets' Corner,  Westminster Abbey. He died in 1708, at the early age of 32.                       [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT.]                               THE NORTH TRANSEPT.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      The next monument in the north transept is the effigy of Bishop Thomas  Charlton, treasurer of England, 1329. This effigy and its richly decorated  alcove or canopy was most luckily not touched by Wyatt.    Here are stained-glass windows to Captain Arkwright, lost in an avalanche;  Captain Kempson, and Rev. S. Clark, Headmaster of Battersea College.    In a line with the central pier of the eastern aisle is the most important  monument in the north transept, viz.:--the pedestal of the celebrated  shrine of St. Thomas de Cantilupe, 1282, who died at Civita Vecchia, near  Florence, on his way to Rome, August 25th, 1282. His heart was sent to  Ashridge in Buckinghamshire, part of the body was buried near Orvieto; and  the bones were brought to Hereford and deposited in the Lady Chapel.    The pedestal is in shape a long parallelogram, narrower at the lower end.  It is of Purbeck marble, and consists of two stages, the lower having a  series of cinquefoiled niches and fourteen figures of Templars in chain  armour in different attitudes, for Bishop Cantilupe was Provincial Grand  Master of the Knights Templars in England.    All the figures are seated with various monsters under their feet. The  filling of the spandrels between these niches and that of the spandrels  between the arches of the upper stage is especially noteworthy. It belongs  to the first Decorated period, and while the arrangement is still somewhat  stiff or formal, the forms are evidently directly copied from"]]]
