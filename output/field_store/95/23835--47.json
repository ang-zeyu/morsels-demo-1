"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19900"],[0,"The Mysteries of All Nations (#8)"],[1,"dreams were  sometimes, indeed generally, sent for instruction or admonition; and  in the prophetic dreams a clear and distinct impression was left  through a real or imaginary communication with an apparition. At times  the prophets had overpowering visions when awake, during which mighty  revelations were made to them. When prophetic revelations ceased, the  Jews had recourse to Bath Kol, that is, the Daughter of Voice, or the  Daughter of a Voice, because it succeeded, they say, the Oracular  Voice delivered from the Mercy Seat when Urim and Thummim was  consulted.    The prophetic spirit being so common among the Hebrews, it became  necessary to adopt a method to prevent false prophets from deceiving  the people. To deter men from pretending they possessed a prophetic  spirit, a severe punishment for every such pretence was  appointed,--strangling or stoning to death. The manner of trying a  false prophet was this: the judgments threatened by a prophet, and the  good things predicted by him, were observed. If the judgments declared  were not fulfilled, it was not regarded as conclusive evidence against  him, because it might be that the punishments were for some wise  reason averted; but if the promised good did not come to pass, the  predictor was condemned as a deceiver and false prophet. If the words  of a prophet were fulfilled in one or more particulars, but not in  all, he was not deemed worthy of credence. When once one was  condemned as a false prophet, no interest was powerful enough to save  him from death.    The trial of prophets prescribed by the Mosaic law was intended to  prevent impostors pretending to be prophets, and to save the people  from being enticed by wicked deceivers into idolatry. In the time of  Moses there were many who had recourse to diabolical arts. The  oblation of children to Moloch being frequently mentioned, together  with other diabolical and divinatory arts, reasons appear for  supposing there was something magical in such superstitious rites, and  that thereby people consulted demons about things future or secret.  Moloch was the principal idol of the Ammonites, but other nations took  the same idol for their chief god; for it appears from Pagan records,  that the different nations were so very accommodating with their gods  that they lent them to one another. Moloch seems to have been the same  as Baal, both names signifying dominion, or more particularly the sun,  the prince of the heavenly bodies.    There can be no doubt but the passage in the Old Testament, \"Thou  shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk,\" was a warning to the  Hebrews not to follow the example of the heathen in connection with  the payment by the latter of their first fruits. Dr. Cudworth, writing  on this subject, says that he learned from the comments of an ancient  Karaite upon the Pentateuch, that a superstitious rite prevailed among  the ancient idolators, of seething a kid in his mother's milk when  they had gathered in all their first fruits, and sprinkling the trees  and fields with the broth, after a magical manner, to make them more  fruitful in the following year. Spencer also observes that the Zabii  used this kind of magical broth to sprinkle their trees and gardens,  in hope of obtaining a plentiful crop.    The smooth stones mentioned by Isaiah, to which meat offerings were  offered and drink offerings poured out, were anointed stones in the  streets, on which passengers poured on them oil from phials; but what  advantages were to result from the custom we are not fully informed.  Oil and candles were believed by the ancients to possess peculiar  virtues. Oil was often burned in honour of the dead; and the  Algerines, when on the water, tied bundles of wax candles together,  and, with a pot of oil, threw them overboard as a present to the  saint, entombed near the Barbary shore, whom they regarded as their  protector. We believe few who partake of sheep-head or sheep-head  broth know that it is, or was, a custom with the Jews to serve up  sheep-head on New Year's Day at their chief entertainment, as a  mystical representation of the ram offered in sacrifice instead of  Isaac. When a family or company sat down to this repast, each person  took a piece of bread, and, dipping it in honey, said, \"May this year  be sweet and fruitful.\" The Jews, to cast their sins into the depth of  the sea, sometimes went after dinner to the brink of a pond, if not  near the sea, and threw into the water a live fish, in the hope that  it would carry away all their iniquities, never more to be found.    It was customary among the Pharisees not only to fast twice a week (on  Monday and Thursday), but at periods of perplexity to fast thirteen  days consecutively. Sometimes, on account of such small trifles as  dreams, they would abstain from food; but severe drought, pestilence,  famine, war, and inundations were sure to make them fast until nature  was nearly exhausted. The Hebrews held certain views and followed  particular customs with respect to the dust of heathen countries. Dust  that came from Gentile lands was reckoned so defiling, that the Jewish  rulers would not permit vegetables to be brought from heathen  countries into the land of Israel, lest the detested particles should  be brought along with them. The number 10 was much noticed and used by  the Jews. The blessing of the bridegroom, which consisted of seven  blessings, was of no avail unless delivered in the presence of ten  persons. Angels, which were believed to have the care of men, were  supposed to ride unseen, on white horses, beside the objects of their  attention.    Among the Jews there was a popular notion that the spirits of dead  persons whispered in a feeble and peculiar way out of the dust; and it  was a common belief that the soul had no rest unless the body was  interred. There were women among the Hebrews who predicted how long  one would live, and pretended to know when he was to die. One of a  Jew's solemn prayers on the day of expiation was that he might be  delivered from the punishment of the devil in his grave,--a punishment  supposed to be inflicted by causing the soul to return to the body,  breaking the deceased's bones, and tormenting both soul and body for a  season. A similar form of prayer was used by the Mohammedans.          CHAPTER III.

Egypt was a country steeped in superstition. The people believed in  sorcery, magic, and enchantments; and there is the fullest evidence in  the sacred pages that the Egyptian magicians were able to perform  dexterous feats that were truly surprising. Astronomy was studied with  a view to success in astrology, as the latter was a science much  esteemed, and very lucrative. Public or state astrologers were  consulted in cases of emergencies. None dared to practise astrology,  magic, sorcery, or any of the various modes of divination unless  authorised by a master in the art, before whom he had \"spread the  carpet\" for prayer. To procure sublime visions, seers shut themselves  up for a long time, without food or water, in a dark place, and prayed  aloud until they fainted. While in a swoon, strange visions appeared  to them, and revelations made which sometimes filled the nation with  gladness, and at other times spread mourning over the country. In  advanced ages, as well as in early times, men believed there were a  multitude of subordinate spirits, as ministers, to execute the behests  of the supreme sovereign. To these spirits were committed the  superintendence of all the different parts of nature, and their bodies  were imagined to be composed of that particular element in which they  resided. Altars were built in the midst of groves, where the spirits  were supposed to assemble. Gratitude and admiration tended to the  deification of departed heroes and other eminent persons. This  probably gave rise to the belief of national and tutelar gods, as well  as the practice of worshipping gods through the medium of statues cut  into human form. At one time demi-gods gradually rose in the scale of  divinities until they occupied the places of the heavenly bodies.  Thus, following ancient hyperbole, a king, for his beneficence, was  called the sun, and a queen, for her beauty, was styled the moon. As  this adulation advanced into an established worship, the compliment  was reversed by calling planets or luminaries after heroes. And to  render the subject more reconcilable to reason, the Eastern priests  taught that the early founders of states and inventors of arts were  divine intelligences, clothed with human bodies. When celestial  divinities disappeared or were obscured from observation, men had  recourse to symbols of a temporary nature that produced fire. Altars  of stone were built and consecrated in the name of the divinity whom  it was intended to represent. Such altars were called animated or  living stones, from a belief that a portion of divine spirit resided  in them, and the prayers and praises offered up before them were  thought to be as acceptable as if addressed to the gods themselves.  That those altars or stones might be as near as possible to the  objects of worship represented, they were generally placed on the tops  of mountains, or, in flat countries like Egypt, on high structures,  the works of men's hands. Many have attributed the building of the  pyramids to the worship of gods; but whether that was the purpose to  which those majestic structures, that have puzzled"]]]
