They pursued their route, but lessened  in their numbers every day. The gentlemen who, as we said before, had  come from different countries, after severally repeating their  obligations to the princess and her brothers, took leave of them one  after another as they approached the road by which they had come.    As soon as the princess reached home, she placed the cage in the garden,  and the Bird no sooner began to warble than he was surrounded by  nightingales, chaffinches, larks, linnets, goldfinches, and every  species of birds of the country. The branch of the Singing Tree was no  sooner set in the midst of the parterre, a little distance from the  house, than it took root and in a short time became a large tree, the  leaves of which gave as harmonious a concert as those of the parent from  which it was gathered. A large basin of beautiful marble was placed in  the garden, and when it was finished, the princess poured into it all  the Golden Water from the flagon, which instantly increased and swelled  so much that it soon reached up to the edges of the basin, and afterward  formed in the middle a fountain twenty feet high, which fell again into  the basin perpetually, without running over.    The report of these wonders was presently spread abroad, and as the  gates of the house and those of the gardens were shut to nobody, a great  number of people came to admire them.    Some days after, when the Princes Bahman and Perviz had recovered from  the fatigue of their journey, they resumed their former way of living;  and as their usual diversion was hunting, they mounted their horses and  went for the first time since their return, not to their own demesne,  but two or three leagues from their house. As they pursued their sport,  the emperor of Persia came in pursuit of game upon the same ground. When  they perceived, by the number of horsemen in different places, that he  would soon be up, they resolved to discontinue their chase, and retire  to avoid encountering him; but in the very road they took they chanced  to meet him in so narrow a way that they could not retreat without being  seen. In their surprise they had only time to alight and prostrate  themselves before the emperor, without lifting up their heads to look at  him. The emperor, who saw they were as well mounted and dressed as if  they had belonged to his court, had a curiosity to see their faces. He  stopped and commanded them to rise. The princes rose up and stood before  him with an easy and graceful air, accompanied with modest countenances.  The emperor took some time to view them before he spoke, and after he  had admired their good air and mien, asked them who they were and where  they lived.    \"Sir,\" said Prince Bahman, \"we are the sons of the late intendant of  your majesty's gardens, and live in a house which he built a little  before he died, till we should be fit to serve your majesty and ask of  you some employ when opportunity offered.\"    \"By what I perceive,\" replied the emperor, \"you love hunting.\" \"Sir,\"  replied Prince Bahman, \"it is our common exercise, and what none of your  majesty's subjects who intend to bear arms in your armies, ought,  according to the ancient custom of the kingdom, to neglect.\" The  emperor, charmed with so prudent an answer, said: \"Since it is so, I  should be glad to see your expertness in the chase; choose your own  game.\"    The princes mounted their horses again and followed the emperor, but had  not gone far before they saw many wild beasts together. Prince Bahman  chose a lion and Prince Perviz a bear, and pursued them with so much  intrepidity that the emperor was surprised. They came up with their game  nearly at the same time, and darted their javelins with so much skill  and address that they pierced the one the lion and the other the bear so  effectually that the emperor saw them fall one after the other.  Immediately afterward Prince Bahman pursued another bear, and Prince  Perviz another lion, and killed them in a short time, and would have  beaten out for fresh game, but the emperor would not let them, and sent  to them to come to him. When they approached he said: \"If I had given  you leave, you would soon have destroyed all my game; but it is not that  which I would preserve, but your persons; for I am so well assured your  bravery may one time or other be serviceable to me, that from this  moment your lives will be always dear to me.\"    The emperor, in short, conceived so great a kindness for the two  princes, that he invited them immediately to make him a visit, to which  Prince Bahman replied: \"Your majesty does us an honour we do not  deserve, and we beg you will excuse us.\"    The emperor, who could not comprehend what reason the princes could have  to refuse this token of his favour, pressed them to tell him why they  excused themselves. \"Sir,\" said Prince Bahman, \"we have a sister younger  than ourselves, with whom we live in such perfect union, that we  undertake nothing before we consult her, nor she anything without asking  our advice.\" \"I commend your brotherly affection,\" answered the emperor.  \"Consult your sister, meet me to-morrow, and give me an answer.\"    The princes went home, but neglected to speak of their adventure in  meeting the emperor and hunting with him, and also of the honour he had  done them, yet did not the next morning fail to meet him at the place  appointed. \"Well,\" said the emperor, \"have you spoken to your sister,  and has she consented to the pleasure I expect of seeing you?\" The two  princes looked at each other and blushed. \"Sir,\" said Prince Bahman, \"we  beg your majesty to excuse us, for both my brother and I forgot.\" \"Then  remember to-day,\" replied the emperor, \"and be sure to bring me an  answer to-morrow.\"    The princes were guilty of the same fault a second time, and the emperor  was so good-natured as to forgive their negligence; but to prevent their  forgetfulness the third time, he pulled three little golden balls out of  a purse, and put them into Prince Bahman's bosom. \"These balls,\" said  he, smiling, \"will prevent your forgetting a third time what I wish you  to do for my sake; since the noise they will make by falling on the  floor when you undress will remind you, if you do not recollect it  before.\" The event happened just as the emperor foresaw; and without  these balls the princes had not thought of speaking to their sister of  this affair, for as Prince Bahman unloosed his girdle to go to bed the  balls dropped on the floor, upon which he ran into Prince Perviz's  chamber, when both went into the Princess Periezade's apartment, and  after they had asked her pardon for coming at so unseasonable a time,  they told her all the circumstances of their meeting the emperor.    The princess was somewhat surprised at this intelligence. \"Your meeting  with the emperor,\" said she, \"is happy and honourable and may in the end  be highly advantageous to you, but it places me in an awkward position.  It was on my account, I know, you refused the emperor, and I am  infinitely obliged to you for doing so. I know by this that you would  rather be guilty of incivility toward the emperor than violate the union  we have sworn to each other. You judge right, for if you had once gone  you would insensibly have been engaged to devote yourselves to him. But  do you think it an easy matter absolutely to refuse the emperor what he  seems so earnestly to desire? Monarchs will be obeyed in their desires,  and it may be dangerous to oppose them; therefore, if to follow my  inclination I should dissuade you from obeying him, it may expose you to  his resentment, and may render myself and you miserable. These are my  sentiments; but before we conclude upon anything let us consult the  Talking Bird and hear what he says; he is penetrating, and has promised  his assistance in all difficulties.\"    The princess sent for the cage, and after she had related the  circumstances to the Bird in the presence of her brothers, asked him  what they should do in this perplexity. The Bird answered: \"The princes,  your brothers, must conform to the emperor's pleasure, and in their turn  invite him to come and see your house.\"    \"But, Bird,\" replied the princess, \"my brothers and I love one another,  and our friendship is yet undisturbed. Will not this step be injurious  to that friendship?\" \"Not at all,\" replied the Bird; \"it will tend  rather to cement it.\" \"Then,\" answered the princess, \"the emperor will  see me.\" The Bird told her it was necessary he should, and that  everything would go better afterward.    Next morning the princes met the emperor hunting, who asked them if they  had remembered to speak to their sister. Prince Bahman approached and  answered: \"Sir, we are ready to obey you, for we have not only obtained  our sister's consent with great ease, but she took it amiss that we  should pay her that deference in a matter wherein our duty to your  majesty was concerned. If we have offended, we hope you will pardon  us.\" \"Do not be uneasy,\" replied the emperor. \"I highly approve of your  conduct, and hope you will have the same deference and attachment to my  person, if I have ever so little share in your friendship.\" The princes,  confounded at the emperor's goodness, returned no other answer but a low  obeisance.    The emperor, contrary to his usual custom, did not hunt long that day.  Presuming that the princes possessed wit equal to their courage and  bravery, he longed with impatience to converse with them more at  liberty. He made them ride on each side of him, an honour which was  envied by the grand vizier, who was much mortified to see them preferred  before him.    When the emperor entered his capital, the eyes of the people, who stood  in crowds in the streets, were fixed upon the two Princes Bahman and  Perviz; and they were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#8)"],[1,". 13.]      +The Galilee[23] or Western Porch.+    [Footnote 23: The name \"Galilee\" is thus accounted for by the late  Rev. G. Millers in his \"Description of Ely Cathedral,\" p. 43. \"As  Galilee, bordering on the Gentiles, was the most remote part of the  Holy Land from the Holy City of Jerusalem, so was this part of the  building most distant from the sanctuary, occupied by those unhappy  persons, who, during their exclusion from the mysteries, were reputed  scarcely, if at all better than heathens.\"    Another writer gives as a reason for the name, that upon a woman  applying for leave to see a monk, her relation, she was answered in  the words of Scripture, \"Behold he goeth before you into Galilee,  there you shall see him.\"]    This has been stated to have been erected by Bishop Eustace  (1198-1215), but although he is known to have made large additions to  the building and to have built the Church of St. Mary, it has been  thought the present building is not quite so early as that date, and  that it was \"the work of some unknown benefactor, who had probably  seen Hugh de Northwold's presbytery, and determined to lengthen the  church westward as it had been extended in the opposite  direction?\"[24] and that it occupies the site of a former building.  Sir G. Scott seemed to think it was the work of Bishop Eustace.[25]    [Footnote 24: Stewart, p. 53.]    [Footnote 25: Mr. Scott's Lecture.]    It is a beautiful specimen, and may fairly be ranked among the most  exquisite Early English works we possess. \"Nothing,\" says Mr. Parker,  \"can exceed the richness, freedom and beauty of this work; it is one  of the finest porches in the world.\"[26] Externally, both sides are  adorned with four tiers of arcading of different heights, one above  another; in front, the recesses of the arches are deeper, and were  probably intended for the reception of statues; some of them are  ornamented with dog-tooth mouldings, and have trefoils in the  spandrils. It is of two stories without windows in the sides; in the  upper story there is a triple lancet window at the west end, the  middle light being higher than the one on either side; the lower story  receives light through the western opening. The arch of entrance is  very elegant, and worthy of notice; it is receding, with rich and  various mouldings, which on each side rest upon slender columns; a  central group of shafts separates the opening into two smaller arches,  with good tracery in the tympanum. The length on each side,  internally, is occupied by two large pointed arches, comprehending  under each two tiers of subordinate ones, the upper tier of five and  the lower of three, which contains both outer and inner arches of  different heights, supported by very slender columns; all the shafts  were originally of Purbeck marble, with elegant capitals; the ribs of  the vaulting are of free-stone, but the vault is of clunch. The arch  of communication with the Tower is also very beautiful; it is similar  in form to the exterior arch, but the ornaments in the mouldings are  richer and more delicate: this has just been restored, and the Purbeck  marble pillars--some of which had disappeared and others had become  decayed--have been replaced by pillars of Devonshire marble with  Purbeck plinths and capitals; the vesica in the tympanum has been  filled with stained glass representing St. Etheldreda, the foundress;  the original oaken doors have been repaired, faced, and ornamented  with scrollwork in iron: this has been effected at a cost of more than  L1000. contributed by Mrs. Waddington, of Twyford House, Winchester,  as a memorial to her husband.    [Footnote 26: Parker's \"Introduction to the study of Gothic  Architecture,\" p. 91.]      +The Interior of the Tower+    has been considerably improved by the removal of a floor which had  been inserted just above the lower arches, thus opening it to the  great lantern, bringing into view a series of beautiful colonnades  and arches, for many years hidden, except to those who explored the  upper portions, besides relieving it of the weight of a large quantity  of stone and materials.[27] The tops of the four fine arches which  originally supported the Tower can now be partially seen; they were  spacious openings, but are contracted by interior arches in a  different style, which were inserted in the early part of the  fifteenth century, for the purpose of strengthening the building. The  beautiful painted ceiling of the Tower was designed, and all its  essential parts executed, with a rare union of artistic skill and  archaeological knowledge, by H.S. le Strange, Esq., of Hunstanton Hall,  Norfolk, at the expense of H.R. Evans, Esq., then Registrar to the  Dean and Chapter; the centre contains a figure of the Saviour in an  aureole: He is represented as holding a globe in His left hand, and is  surrounded by the sun, moon, and stars; on either side are Cherubim  and Seraphim bearing scrolls containing the words \"Holy! Holy! Lord  God of Sabaoth.\" The eastern centre contains a shield on which is the  _dextra Domini_, the \"right hand of the Lord,\" as an emblem of the  Creator; the corners are enriched with foliage, and the whole is  surrounded by a border containing the words \"Thou art worthy, O Lord,  to receive glory, and honour, and power; for Thou hast created all  things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.\" This was  finished in 1855. The floor, of which the pattern forms a labyrinth,  was completed in 1870.    [Footnote 27: At the time these works were in progress (Oct., 1845),  Mr. Bassevi, the eminent architect of the Fitzwilliam Museum, at  Cambridge, visited the Tower, and unfortunately fell from one floor to  another, and was killed. He was buried in the north aisle of the  Choir, and an elegant monumental brass, by Messrs. Waller has been  laid over his remains.]    The window over the entrance from the Galilee, was inserted A.D. 1800,  and improved in 1807 at the expense of Bishop Yorke, who filled two  portions of the upper part with stained glass, the other two being  filled at the cost of Dr. Waddington, then a Prebendary of the  Cathedral; the remainder has lately been completed by Mr.  Clutterbuck; the subjects are taken from the history of our Lord.  This, with the wall decoration below, has been done at the expense of  J.T. Waddington, Esq., and of his widow. Beneath the window are four  shields of arms; the upper one on the south side shows the arms of  Bishop Yorke impaled with the arms of the see; on the north side are  those of Bishop Yorke with those of Dr. Waddington; the lower ones  contain on the south, the arms of J.T. Waddington, Esq., and on the  north side, the same impaled with those of the family of Cocksedge, of  which Mrs. Waddington was a member.           *       *       *       *       *    Before proceeding further the visitor should pause, and observe the  great length of the Cathedral, the noble appearance of the lofty  arches, and the sublime grandeur of the whole. When we look around and  see the lofty Tower with its decorated ceiling above; on the right,  the south-west Transept, rich in the extreme with its several arcades  of plain, intersecting, and trifoliated arches; and in front, through  the long vista of the Nave, the noble Octagon, and the enriched Choir,  to the extreme end of the church, we cannot but pause and admire the  skill of man shewn in such a work; but when we consider to whose  honour and glory such skill is exerted, we no longer wonder that man's  best energies should be called forth to construct and ornament such a  temple,         \"Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault       The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\"--_Gray_.    May those who visit this temple for the purpose of examining it as a  building made with hands, ever bear in mind the great and solemn  purpose for which it was erected--the worship of Almighty God--and let  their aspirations of prayer and praise ascend to Him in thankfulness  for the privilege afforded to them of freely and openly worshipping  Him, who as freely invites all to become partakers of a home made  without hands, eternal in the heavens.      +The South-west Transept+    was, until a few years ago, separated from the Tower by a wall of stud  and plaster, and used as a receptacle for materials required for the  repair of the fabric, but is now thrown open in all its beauty; it has  been repaired and restored at considerable expense.    The architecture of this portion of the Cathedral is worthy of special  notice; the various forms of the arches, and the beautiful mouldings  and ornaments on some of them, cannot but attract attention. The  panelled ceiling has been painted by T. Gambier Parry, Esq., of  Highnam Court, Gloucester; the floor has been re-laid with encaustic  tiles and marble; a new font[28] in the transitional style, has been  placed here, at the cost of the late Canon Selwyn, and this Transept  will in future be used as the Baptistry of the Cathedral. Several  windows, which had for many years been blocked up with stone and  rubbish, have been re-opened, and those of the lower tier at the south  end filled with stained glass by Mr. Wailes:         The west window contains--the Meeting of Jacob and Rachel;       the Choice of Esther; and the Crowning of Esther; and was       the gift of Dean Peacock.         The east window comprises--the Meeting of Isaac and Rebecca;       of Boaz and Ruth; and the Marriage at Cana: given by       Hamilton Cooke, Esq., of Carr House, Doncaster.    [Footnote 28: A font, the gift of Dean Spencer, in 1693, formerly  stood under the third arch on the south side of the Nave, but having  no accordance in style with the architecture of the building, it has  been removed, and placed in a newly erected church at Prickwillow,  near Ely.]    Adjoining this Transept on the east is the apsidal +Chapel of St.  Catharine+, for many years in ruins, but rebuilt in"]]]
