In order to lodge this group of amateurs in a very suitable to its regal  pretensions, architecture invented original and grand forms. Vast  structures always indicate some corresponding excess, some immoderate  concentration and accumulation of the labor of humanity. Look at the  Gothic cathedrals, the pyramids of Egypt, Paris of the present day, and  the docks of London!    On reaching the end of a long line of narrow streets, white walls, and  deserted gardens, the great ruin appears. There is nothing with which to  compare its form, while the line it describes on the sky is unique. No  mountains, no hills, no edifices, give any idea of it. It resembles all  these; it is a human structure, which time and events have so deformed  and transformed, as to render a natural production. Rising upward in the  air, its moss-stained embossed summit and indented crest with its wide  crevices, a red, mournful, decayed mass, silently reposes in a shroud of  clouds.    You enter, and it seems as if you had never seen anything in the world  so grand. The Coliseum itself is no approach to it, so much do a  multiplicity and irregularity of ruins add to the vastness of the vast  enclosure. Before these heaps of red corroded masonry, these round  vaults spanning the air like the arches of a mighty bridge before these  crumbling walls, you wonder whether an entire city did not once exist  there. Frequently an arch has fallen, and the monstrous mass that  sustained it still stands erect, exposing remnants of staircases and  fragments of arcades, like so many shapeless, deformed houses.    Sometimes it is cleft in the center, and a portion appears about to fall  and roll away, like a huge rock. Sections of wall and pieces of  tottering arches cling to it and dart their projections threateningly  upward in the air. The courts are strewed with various fragments, and  blocks of brick welded together by the action of time, like stones  incrusted with the deposits of the sea. Elsewhere are arcades quite  intact, piled up story upon story, the bright sky appearing behind them,  and above, along the dull red brickwork is a verdant head-dress of  plants, waving and rustling in the midst of the ethereal blue.    Here are mystic depths, wherein the bedewed shade prolongs itself among  mysterious shadows. Into these the ivy descends, and anemones, fennel,  and mallows fringe their brinks. Shafts of columns lie half-buried under  climbing vines and heaps of rubbish, while luxuriant clover carpets the  surrounding slopes. Small green oaks, with round tops, innumerable green  shrubs, and myriads of gillyflowers cling to the various projections,  nestle in the hollows, and deck its crest with their yellow clusters.  All these murmur in the breeze, and the birds are singing in the midst  of the imposing silence....    You ascend, I know not how many stories, and, on the summit, find the  pavement of the upper chambers to consist of checkered squares of  marble; owing to the shrubs and plants that have taken root among them,  these are disjoined in places, a fresh bit of mosaic sometimes appearing  intact on removing a layer of earth. Here were sixteen hundred seats of  polished marble. In the Baths of Diocletian there were places for three  thousand two hundred bathers. From this elevation, on casting your eyes  around, you see, on the plain, lines of ancient aqueducts radiating in  all directions and losing themselves in the distance, and, on the side  of Albano, three other vast ruins, masses of red and black arcades,  shattered and disintegrated brick by brick, and corroded by time.    You descend and take another glance. The hall of the \"piscine\" is a  hundred and twenty paces long; that in which the bathers disrobed is  eighty feet in height; the whole is covered with marble, and with such  beautiful marble that mantel ornaments are now made of its fragments. In  the sixteenth century the Farnese Hercules was discovered here, and the  Torso and Venus Callipygis, and I know not how many other masterpieces;  and in the seventeenth century hundreds of statues. No people, probably,  will ever again display the same luxurious conveniences, the same  diversions, and especially the same order of beauty, as that which the  Romans displayed in Rome.    Here only can you comprehend this assertion--a civilization other than  our own, other and different, but in its kind as complete and as  elegant. It is another animal, but equally perfect, like the mastodon,  previous to the modern elephant.          THE AQUEDUCT BUILDERS[15]    BY RODOLFO LANCIANI      One of the praises bestowed by Cicero on the founder of the city is that  \"he selected a district very rich in springs.\" A glance at the plan will  at once prove the accuracy of the statement. Twenty-three springs have  been described within the walls, several of which are still in  existence; others have disappeared owing to the increase of modern soil.  \"For four hundred and forty-one years,\" says Frontinus, \"the Romans  contented themselves with such water as they could get from the Tiber,  from wells, and from springs. Some of these springs are still held in  great veneration on account of their health-restoring qualities, like  the spring of the Camoenae, that of Apollo, and that of Juturna.\"    The first aqueduct, that of the \"Aqua Appia,\" is the joint work of  Appius Claudius Caecus and C. Plautius Venox, censors in 312  B.C. The first built the channel, the second discovered the  springs 1,153 meters northeast of the sixth and seventh milestones of  the Via Collatina. They are still to be seen, much reduced in volume, at  the bottom of some stone quarries near the farmhouse of La Rustica.    The second aqueduct was begun in 272 B.C. by Manius Curius  Dentatus, censor, and finished three years later by Fulvius Flaccus. The  water was taken from the river Anio 850 meters above St. Cosimato, on  the road from Tivoli to Arsoli (Valeria). The course of the channel can  be traced as far as Gallicano; from Gallicano to Rome it is  uncertain....    In 144 B.C. the Senate, considering that the increase of the  population had diminished the rate of distribution of water (from 530 to  430 liters per head), determined that the old aqueducts of the Appia and  the Anio should be repaired, and a new one built, the appropriation for  both works being 8,000,000 sesterces, or 1,760,000 lire.    The execution of the scheme was entrusted to Q. Marcius Rex. He selected  a group of springs at the foot of the Monte della Prugna, in the  territory of Arsoli, 4,437 meters to the right of the thirty-sixth  milestone of the Via Valeria; and after many years of untiring efforts  he succeeded in making a display of the water on the highest platform of  the Capitol. Agrippa restored the aqueduct in 33 B.C.; Augustus  doubled the volume of the water in 5 B.C. by the addition of  the Aqua Augusta. In 196 Septimius Severus brought in a new supply for  the use of his Thermae Severianae; in 212-213 Caracalla built a branch  aqueduct, four miles long, for the use of his baths; in 305-306  Diocletian did the same thing for his great thermae; and, finally,  Arcadius and Honorius devoted to the restoration of the aqueduct the  money seized from Count Gildo, the African rebel.    None of the Roman aqueducts are eulogized by Frontinus like the  Claudian. He calls it \"a work most magnificently done,\" and after  demonstrating in more than one way that the volume of the springs  collected by Claudius amounted to 4,607 quinariae, he says that there  was a reserve of 1,600 always ready.    The works, began by Caligula in A.D. 38, lasted fourteen years,  the water having reached Rome only on August 1, 52 (the birthday of  Claudius). The course of the aqueduct was first around the slopes of the  Monte Ripoli, like that of the Marcia and of the Anio Vetus. Domitian  shortened it by several miles by boring a tunnel 4,950 meters long  through the Monte Affiano. Length of channel, 68,750 meters, of which  15,000 was on arches; volume per day, 209,252 cubic meters. The Claudia  was used for the Imperial table; a branch aqueduct, 2,000 meters long,  left the main channel at Spem Veterem (Porta Maggiore), and following  the line of the Via Caelimontana (Villa Wolkonsky), of the Campus  Caelimontan (Lateran), and of the street now called di S. Stefano  Rotondo, reached the temple of Claudius by the church of SS. Giovanni e  Paolo, and the Imperial palace by the church of St. Bonaventura.    The Anio Novus, like the Vetus, was at first derived from the river of  the same name at the forty-second milestone of the road to Subiaco,  great precautions being taken for purifying the water. The works were  begun by Caligula in A.D. 38, and completed by Claudius on  August 1, 52, on a most magnificent scale, some of the arches reaching  the height of thirty-two meters above ground; and there were eight miles  of them. Yet, in spite of the purifying reservoir, and of the clear  springs of the Rivus Herculaneus (Fosso di Fioggio), which had been  mixed with the water from the river, the Anio Novus was hardly ever  drinkable. Whenever a shower fell on the Simbruine mountains, the water  would get troubled and saturated with mud and carbonate of lime. Trajan  improved its condition by carrying the head of the aqueduct higher up  the valley, where Nero had created three artificial lakes for the  adornment of his Villa Sublacensis. These lakes served more efficiently  as \"purgatories,\" than the artificial basin of Caligula, nine miles  below. The Anio Novus reached Rome in its own channel after a course of  86,964 meters, but for the last seven miles it ran on the same arches  with the Aqua Claudia. The Anio Novus was the largest of all Roman  aqueducts, discharging nearly three hundred thousand cubic meters per  day.    There are two places in the suburbs of Rome where these marvelous arches  of the Claudia and Anio Novus can be seen to advantage; one "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#8)"],[1,"intensity.    \"Bad dream?\"    The younger man admitted to that with a nod, partly against his will.    \"Well, you aren't the only one. Remember any of it?\"    With an effort, Dane looked away from the encircling dark. It was as if  the fear which had shaken him awake, now embodied, lurked right there.    \"No.\" He rubbed sleep-smarting eyes.    \"Neither did I,\" Tau remarked. \"But both of 'em must have been  jet-powered.\"    \"I suppose one could expect to have nightmares after yesterday.\" Dane  advanced the logical explanation, yet at the same time something deep  inside him denied every word of it. He had known nightmares before; none  of them had left this aftertaste. And he wanted no return of sleep  tonight. Reaching to the pile of wood he fed the fire as Tau settled  down beside him.    \"There is something else....\" the medic began, and then fell silent.  Dane did not press him. The younger man was too busy fighting a growing  desire to whirl and aim the fire ray into that darkness, to catch in its  withering blast that lurking thing he could _feel_ padded there, biding  its time.    Despite his efforts Dane did drowse again before morning, waking  unrefreshed, and, to his secret dismay, with no lessening of his odd  dislike for the country about them.    Asaki did not suggest that they trail the poachers into the morass of  Mygra. Instead the Chief Ranger was eager to press on in the opposite  direction, find a way over the range to the preserve where he could  assemble a punitive force to deal with the outlaws. So they began an  upward climb which took them away from the dank heat of the lowlands,  into the parched blaze of the sunbaked ledges above.    The sun was bright, far too bright, and there were few shadows left. Yet  Dane, stopping to drink sparingly from his canteen, could not lose that  sense of eyes upon him, of being tracked. Rock apes? Cunning as those  beasts were, it was against their nature to trail in utter silence, to  be able to carry through a long-term project. Lion, perhaps?    He noted that Nymani and Asaki took turns at rear guard today, and that  each was alert. Yet, oddly enough, none of them mentioned the uneasiness  they must all share.    They had a dry climb, finding no mountain stream to renew their water  supply. All being experienced in wilderness travel, they made a mouthful  of liquid go a long way. When the party halted slightly before midday,  canteens were still half full.    \"_Haugh!_\"    They jerked up, hands on weapons. A rock ape, its hideous body clearly  seen here, capered, coughed, spat. Asaki fired from the hip and the  thing screeched, clawed at its chest where the dark blood spewed out,  and raced for them. Nymani cut the beast down and they waited tensely  for the attack of the thing's tribe, which should have followed the  abortive lunge on the part of their scout. But there was  nothing--neither sound nor movement.    What did follow froze them all momentarily. That mangled body began to  move again, drew itself together, crawled toward them. Dane knew that it  was impossible that the creature could live with such wounds. Yet the  beast advanced, its head lolling on its hunched shoulders so that the  eyes were turned blindly up to the full glare of the sun, while it  crawled to reach the man it could not see.    \"Demon!\" Nymani dropped his needler, shrank back against the rocks.    As the thing advanced, before their eyes the impossible happened. Those  gaping wounds closed, the head straightened on the almost invisible  neck, the eyes glared once more with life, and slaver dripped from the  swine snout.    Jellico caught up the needler Nymani had dropped. With a coolness Dane  envied, the captain shot. And for the second time the rock ape  collapsed, torn to ribbons.    Nymani screamed, and Dane tried to choke back his own cry of horrified  protest. The dead thing put on life for the second time, crawled, got  somehow to its feet, healed itself, and came on. Asaki, his face  greenish-pale, stepped out stiffly as if each step he took was forced by  torture. He had dropped his needler. Now he caught up a rock as large as  his own head, raised it high with arms on which the muscles stood out  like ropes. He hurled the stone, and Dane heard as well as saw the  missile go home. The rock ape fell for the third time.    When one of those taloned paws began to move again, Nymani broke. He  ran, his screams echoing thinly in the air, as the thing lurched up, the  gory mess of its head weaving about. If his feet would have obeyed him,  Dane might have followed the Khatkan. As it was, he drew his ray and  aimed it at that shambling thing. Tau struck up the barrel.    The medic's face was livid; there was the same horror in his eyes. But  he moved out to front that monster.    A spot of shadow coalesced on the ground, deepened in hue, took on  substance. Crouched low facing the rock ape, its haunches quivering for  a deadly spring, narrowed green eyes holding on its prey, was a black  leopard.    The tiny forward and backward movements of its body steadied, and it  arched through the air, brought down the ape. A pitting, snarling tangle  rolled across the slope--and was gone!    Asaki's hands shook as he drew them down his sweating face. Jellico  readied a second clip in the needler mechanically. But Tau was swaying  so that Dane leaped to take the shock of the other's weight as he  collapsed. Only for a moment did the medic hang so, then he struggled to  stand erect.    \"Magic?\" Jellico's voice, as controlled as ever, broke the silence.    \"Mass hallucination,\" Tau corrected him. \"Very strong.\"    \"How!\" Asaki swallowed and began again. \"How was it done?\"    The medic shook his head. \"Not by the usual methods, that is certain.  And it worked on us--on me--when we weren't conditioned. I don't  understand that!\"    Dane could hardly believe it yet. He watched Jellico stride to where the  tangle of struggling beasts had rolled, saw him examine bare ground on  which no trace of the fight remained. They must accept Tau's  explanation; it was the only sane one.    Asaki's features were suddenly convulsed with a rage so stark that Dane  realized how much a veneer was the painfully built civilization of  Khatka.    \"_Lumbrilo!_\" The Chief Ranger made of that name a curse. Then with a  visible effort he controlled his emotions and came to Tau, looming over  the slighter medic almost menacingly.    \"How?\" he demanded for the second time.    \"I don't know.\"    \"He will try again?\"    \"Not the same perhaps--\"    But Asaki had already grasped the situation, was looking ahead.    \"We shall not know,\" he breathed, \"what is real, what is not.\"    \"There is also this,\" Tau warned. \"The unreal can kill the believer just  as quickly as the real!\"    \"That I know also. It has happened too many times lately. If we could  only find out how! Here are no drums, no singing--none of the tricks to  tangle a man's mind that he usually uses to summon his demons. So  without Lumbrilo, without his witch tools, how does he make us see what  is not?\"    \"That we must discover and speedily, sir. Or else we shall be lost among  the unreal and the real.\"    \"You also have the power. You can save us!\" Asaki protested.    Tau drew his arm across his face. Very little of the normal color had  returned to his thin, mobile features. He still leaned against Dane's  supporting arm.    \"A man can do only so much, sir. To battle Lumbrilo on his own ground is  exhausting and I can not fight so very often.\"    \"But will he not also be exhausted?\"    \"I wonder....\" Tau gazed beyond the Khatkan to the barren ground where  leopard and rock ape had ceased to be. \"This magic is a tricky thing,  sir. It builds and feeds upon a man's own imagination and inner fears.  Lumbrilo, having triggered ours, need not strive at all, but let us  ourselves raise that which will attack us.\"    \"Drugs?\" demanded Jellico.    Tau gave a start sufficient to take him out of Dane's loose hold. His  hand went to the packet of aid supplies which was his own care, his eyes  round with wonder and then shrewdly alert.    \"Captain, we disinfected those thorn punctures of yours. Thorson, your  foot salve.... But, no, I didn't use anything--\"    \"You forget, Craig, we all had scratches after that fight with the  apes.\"    Tau sat down on the ground. With feverish haste he unsealed his medical  supplies, laid out some containers. Then delicately he opened each,  examined its contents closely by eye, by smell, and two by taste. When  he was done he shook his head.    \"If these have been in any way meddled with, I would need laboratory  analysis to detect it. And I don't believe that Lumbrilo could hide  traces of his work so cleverly. Or has he been off-planet? Had much to  do with off-worlders?\" he asked the Chief Ranger.    \"By the nature of his position he is forbidden to space voyage, to have  any close relationship with any off-worlder. I do not think, medic, he  would choose your healing substances for his mischief. There would only  be chance to aid him then in producing the effects he wants. Though  there is often call for first aid in travel, he could not be _certain_  you would use any of your drugs on this trip to the preserve.\"    \"And Lumbrilo _was_ certain. He threatened something such as this,\"  Jellico reminded them.    \"So it would be something which we would all use, which we had to depend  upon....\"    \"The water!\" Dane had been holding his own canteen ready to drink. But  as that possible explanation dawned in his mind, he smelled instead of  tasted the liquid sloshing inside. There was no odor he could detect.  But he remembered Tau commenting on the powdered purifier pills at their  first camp.    \"That's it!\" Tau dug further into his kit, brought out the vial of white  powder with its grainy lumps. Pouring a little into the palm of his hand  he smelled it, touched it with the tip of his tongue. \"Purifier and  something"]]]
