Can give you four to one now. Anything  else we can do for you?\"    Drew dropped his voice. \"Do you have a safe here?\"    Topham's eyebrows climbed. \"Do you foresee a deposit or a withdrawal?\"    \"Deposit. I want to ride light today.\"    \"Then I'll admit possession of a safe, such as it is. _Don_ Lorenzo, _por  favor_, will you act as banker?\" He beckoned Drew after him into a small  back room which was in sharp contrast to the main part of the Four Jacks.    On one wall was a fanned display of old daggers and swords which dated a  century or so back to the Spanish colonial days. A bookcase crammed with  tightly squeezed volumes provided a resting place for pieces of native  pottery bearing grotesque animal designs. On the far wall were strips of  brightly colored woven materials flanking a huge closed cupboard, a very  old one, Drew thought. Its paneled front was carved with deeply incised  patterns centering about a shield bearing arms. Only the battered desk and  an attendant chair with a laced rawhide seat were of the frontier.    Topham took a chained key from the pocket of his fancy vest and went to  fit it into a lock concealed in the carved foliage of the cupboard. The  shield split down the middle, revealing shelves of metal boxes and packets  of papers. Drew unfastened his money belt and handed it over. As he was  tucking his shirt in his belt once more the gambler nodded at the  cupboard.    \"This is about as near a bank as we boast in Tubacca. Cahill has a  strongbox at the stage station, and Stein some kind of a lockup at his  store--that's the total for the town. We haven't grown to the size for a  real banking establishment--\"    \"Hey, Reese, th' Old Man about--?\"    Shannon was in the doorway. In the full light of day he looked younger.  Drew was puzzled. That strange animosity which had flashed between them  last night--why had he felt it? There was nothing like that emotion now.  But as Johnny Shannon's gaze flitted from Topham to the Kentuckian, Drew  was once more aware that, whatever he might outwardly seem, Johnny Shannon  was no boy. Behind that disarmingly youthful facade was another person  altogether.    \"Kirby, ain't it?\" Shannon smiled. \"Understand I got outta line th' other  night ... stepped on a lotta toes.\" That gaze flickered for the merest  instant to the Colts at the Kentuckian's belt. \"I sure had me a real  snootful an' I guess I was jus' fightin' th' war all over again. No hard  feelin's?\"    That guileless confession was very convincing on the surface. How did you  assess an emotion you did not understand yourself? Drew was teased by a  fleeting memory of the past, of a time when he had faced another pair of  eyes such as those, surface eyes behind which you could see nothing. Then  he became conscious that the pause was too lengthy, and he replied with a  hurry he immediately regretted:    \"No hard feelin's.\"    This time he was able to recognize the meaning of that quirk of Shannon's  lips. But prudence controlled the small flare of temper he felt inside  him. It did not really matter. Let Shannon think he was backing down. If  the time ever came that they did have to have a showdown, Johnny Shannon  might be the surprised one.    \"You're sure a trustin' fella.\" Shannon's fingers hooked to the front of  the gun belt riding low on the hip. \"Not askin' for no receipt or  nothin'....\"    Topham laughed. \"We don't forget what is due a customer, Johnny.\" He went  to the desk, scribbled a line on a piece of paper, and held it out to  Drew. \"This should meet all contingencies, such as some patron out there  getting downright ornery and putting a couple of extra buttonholes in my  vest by the six-gun slug method.\"    \"Heard tell as how you're fixin' to race your plug 'gainst Oro, Kirby,\"  Johnny drawled. \"Also as how you laid down some good round boys to back  his chance. I took me a piece of them--easy pickin's.\" The sneer was  plainer in his voice than it had been in his smile.    Drew's puzzlement grew. Why was Shannon leaning on him this way? Because  he had stepped in to stop the quirting of Teodoro? That was the only  reason the Kentuckian could think of.    \"That's a matter of opinion.\" Topham was studying them both with interest.  \"I'd say Oro has him some real competition at last. None of the Eclipse  blood was ever backward on the track.\"    \"You ridin' yourself?\" Shannon paid no attention to the gambler's comment.    Drew nodded. \"He knows me, and I ride light--\"    \"Sure, I suppose you do--now.\" Shannon's eyes flickered again, this time to  the locked cupboard. \"Heard tell--leastways Callie's been spoutin' it  around--that you was with General Forrest.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You sure musta pulled outta th' war better'n th' rest of us poor Rebs.  Got you a couple of blooded hosses an' a good heavy money belt. A sight  more luck than th' rest of us had--\"    \"Don't include yourself in the empty-pocket brigade, Johnny,\" Topham  rapped out. \"I don't see you going without eating money, drinking money  either, more's a pity. And if you're really looking for Rennie now, you'll  find him down at the course.\"    Shannon's smile was gone. He straightened away from the door frame which  had been supporting his shoulders. \"Thanks a lot, Reese.\" He left with the  same abruptness as he had from the stable alley.    \"So you're riding yourself.\" Topham ignored the departure. \"Leon Rivas,  Bartolome's son, will be up on Oro; he always rides for Rennie. He's  younger than you, but I'd say\"--the gambler studied Drew's lithe body  critically--\"you're about matched in weight. I'd shuck that gun belt,  though, and anything else you can. And good luck, Kirby. You'll need all  of it you can muster.\"    An hour later Drew followed Topham's advice, leaving gun belt, carbine,  and everything else he could unload in Callie's keeping before he swung up  on Shiloh. The big colt was nervous, tending to dance sideways, tossing  his head high. Drew concentrated on the business at hand, striving to  forget the crowd opening up to let him through, shouting encouragement or  disparagement. Ahead was the appointed track, a beaten stretch of earth,  part of the old road leading to the mines. The Kentuckian talked to Shiloh  as they went, keeping up a stream of words to firm the bond between horse  and rider.    There was a knot of men surrounding the golden horse, and as his rider  mounted, Oro put on a good show, rearing to paw the air with his forefeet  as if he wished nothing better than to meet his gray rival in an impromptu  boxing match. Then he nodded his head vigorously, acknowledging the shouts  from his enthusiastic supporters. Beside that magnificent blaze of color  Shiloh was drab, a shadow about to be put to flight by the sun.    They were to break at a starting shot, head to the big tree which made an  excellent landmark in the flat valley, rounding its patch of shade before  returning to the starting point. Drew brought Shiloh, still prancing and  playing with his bit, up beside Oro. The slim boy on the golden horse shot  the Kentuckian a shoulder-side look and grinned, raising his quirt in  salute as Drew nodded and smiled back.    Some of the noise died. _Don_ Lorenzo pointed a pistol skyward. Drew  strove to make his body one with Shiloh's small easy movements. The big  gray knew very well what was in progress, was tensing now for a swift  getaway leap. And he made it on the crack of the gun.    But if Shiloh had easily outdistanced all opposition before on those  improvised tracks, he was now meeting a far more equal race. The gray  colt's stride was effortless, he was pounding out with power--more than  Drew had ever known him to exert. Yet those golden legs matched his pace,  reach for reach, hoofbeat for hoofbeat.    \"Come on, boy!\" Drew's urging was lost in the wild shouting of the  spectators. Some who were mounted were trying to parallel the runners. But  Shiloh responded to his rider's encouragement even if he could not hear or  understand. Drew would never use quirt or spur on the stud. What Shiloh  had to give must come willingly and because he delighted in the giving.    They swept in and around the shade of the tree, made the arc to return.  That golden head with its tossing crown of black forelock; it _was_  slipping back! Oro was no longer nose to nose with Shiloh, rather now nose  to neck. Drew could hear Rivas' voice encouraging, pleading....    A mass of men, mounted and on foot, funneled the runners down to where the  line of rope lay straight to mark the finish. Oro was creeping up once  more, inch by hard-won inch.    Drew's head went up, his throat was rasped raw by the Yell which had taken  desperate gray-coated troopers down hedge-bordered roads in Kentucky and  steep ravines in Tennessee, sending them, if need be, straight into the  mouths of Yankee field guns. And the Yell brought Shiloh home, only a nose  ahead of his rival--as if he had been spurred by the now outlawed war cry.  Then Drew found he had his hands full trying to pull up the colt and  persuade him that the race was indeed over.            5      A black mule came up beside Drew as he slowly pulled Shiloh down to a  canter. Fenner, a wide grin splitting his beard, bellowed:    \"That shore was a race! Need any help, son?\"    Drew shook his head, wanting to bring Shiloh under full control at a rate  which would quiet the colt before they headed back to the furor about the  finish line. And only now did he have time to relish his own excited pride  and pleasure.    Since he had first seen Shiloh on that scouting trip back to Kentucky in  '64, he had known he must someday own the gray colt. He had lain out in  the brush for a long time that morning to watch the head groom of Red  Springs put the horse through his paces in the training paddock. And  watching jealously, Drew had realized that Shiloh "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#8)"],[1," in house framing. It is usually made with the handle fitting  into a socket on the shank, in order to withstand the shock of heavy  blows from the mallet.    The _mortise-chisel_, Fig. 68, is made abnormally thick to give the  stiffness necessary for levering the waste out of mortises.    (2) Chisels are also named according to their shapes: as,  skew-chisels, corner-chisels, round-nosed chisels, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 69. Paring with a Chisel.]    The angle of the bevel of a chisel is determined by the kind of wood  for which it is most used, hard wood requiring a wider angle than soft  wood, in order to support the edge. For ordinary work, the bevel is  correctly ground to an angle of about 20 deg. The chisel is a necessary  tool in making almost every kind of joint. It may almost be said that  one mark of a good workman is his preference for the chisel. Indeed an  excellent motto for the woodworker is: \"When in doubt, use a chisel\".    In general, there are two uses for the chisel (1), when it is driven  by a push with the hand, as in paring, and (2), when it is driven by  blows of a mallet, as in digging mortises.    In relation to the grain of the wood, it is used in three directions:  (1) longitudinally, that is with the grain, called paring; (2)  laterally, across the surface, called cutting sidewise; (3)  transversely, that is across the end, called cutting end-wood.    1. _Paring._ To remove shavings rapidly, the chisel is held flat side  up, the handle grasped by the right hand, with the thumb pointing  toward the shank, and the blade held in the left hand, as in Fig. 69.  Held in this way great control can be exerted and much force applied.  For paring the surface as flat and smooth as possible, the chisel  should be reversed, that is, held so that the flat side will act as a  guide. Held in this way the chisel has no equal for paring except  the plane. Paring with the chisel is the method used in cutting stop  chamfers. (See p. 185, Chapter VIII.) By holding the cutting edge  obliquely to the direction of the grain and of the cut, the effective  \"sliding cut\" is obtained, Fig. 64.    [Illustration: Fig. 70. Chiseling Out a Dado. (First Step).]    [Illustration: Fig. 71. Chiseling Out a Dado. (Second Step).]    2. In _sidewise chiseling_ the chisel is held in the same manner as in  paring. A typical form of sidewise chiseling is the cutting out of a  dado, Fig. 70. The work may be placed on the bench-hook or held in the  vise with the side up from which the groove is to be cut. The chisel  is pushed directly across the grain, the blade being somewhat inclined  to the upper surface so as to cut off a corner next the saw kerf.  After a few cuts thus made with the chisel inclined alternately both  ways, the ridge thus formed is taken off, Fig. 71. In this way the  surface is lowered to the required depth. If more force be required,  the palm of the hand may be used as a mallet.    [Illustration: Fig. 72. Perpendicular Chiseling.]    3. In _chiseling end-wood_, it is well, if possible, to rest the piece  to be trimmed flat on the cutting board or on a piece of waste wood.  Work done in this way is often called perpendicular chiseling, Fig. 72.  The handle is grasped in the right hand, thumb up, while the blade of  the chisel passes between the thumb and first finger of the left hand,  the back of which rests on the work and holds it in place. As the  right hand pushes the chisel downwards the thumb and first finger of  the left hand control its motion. When chiseling it is well to stand  so as to look along the line being cut. Incline the chisel toward you,  and use the near part of the cutting edge for a guide and the farther  corner for cutting, pushing the handle both down and forward at the  same time, Fig. 73. Or, by pushing the chisel sidewise with the  thumb of the left hand at the same time that the right hand pushes it  downward, the effective sliding cut is obtained.    [Illustration: Fig. 73. Chiseling End Wood.]    [Illustration: Fig. 74. Paring a Corner Round.]    [Illustration: Fig. 75. Right and Wrong Ways of Perpendicular  Chiseling.]    End chiseling requires considerable force and therefore only thin  shavings should be cut off at a time. Or the mallet may be used with  caution. In order to leave a smooth surface the chisel must be very  sharp. Even then the lower arris (corner) is likely to be splintered  off. This can be prevented by clamping the work down tight with a  handscrew to a perfectly smooth cutting board. It is often advisable  however, to set the piece upright in the vise and pare off thin  shavings horizontally, Fig. 74. In rounding a corner, both this and  perpendicular chiseling are common methods. In both cases care should  be taken to cut from the side toward the end and not into the grain,  lest the piece split, Fig. 75. In horizontal end paring, Fig. 74,  in order to prevent splintering, it is well to trim down the arrises  diagonally to the line and then to reduce the rest of the end surface.    In all hand chiseling, it is a wise precaution not to try to cut out  much material at each stroke but to work back gradually to the line.    [Illustration: Fig. 76. Mallet Chiseling. The Piece is Clamped Down on  the Bench With the Bench Hook.]    A typical form of mallet chiseling is the digging of a mortise, Fig.  76. (See also p. 56.) The chisel is held perpendicular in the left  hand, while the right hand drives blows with the mallet. The hammer  should never be used. (See mallet, p. 96.) By rocking the chisel and  at the same time giving it a twisting motion while the edge is kept  on the wood, the edge can be stepped to the exact place desired. Care  should be taken to work back to the lines gradually, to cut only part  way thru from each side (in the case of a thru mortise-and-tenon), and  to keep the cut faces perpendicular to the surfaces.    In sharpening a chisel it is of first importance that the back be  kept perfectly flat. The bevel is first ground on the grindstone to  an angle of about 20 deg. and great care should be taken to keep the edge  straight and at right angles to the sides of the blade.    [Illustration: Fig. 77. Whetting a Plane-Bit.]    After grinding it is necessary to whet the chisel and other edged  tools. (See also under oilstones, p. 121.) First see that there is  plenty of oil on the stone. If an iron box be used, Fig. 77, the oil  is obtained simply by turning the stone over, for it rests on a pad of  felt which is kept wet with kerosene.    Place the beveled edge flat on the stone, feeling to see if it does  lie flat, then tip up the chisel and rub it at an angle slightly more  obtuse than that which it was ground, Fig. 78. The more nearly the  chisel can be whetted at the angle at which it was ground the better.  In rubbing, use as much of the stone as possible, so as to wear it  down evenly. The motion may be back and forth or spiral, but in either  case it should be steady and not rocking. This whetting turns a light  wire edge over on the flat side. In order to remove this wire edge,  the back of the chisel, that is, the straight, unbeveled side, is held  perfectly flat on the whetstone and rubbed, then it is turned over and  the bevel rubbed again on the stone. It is necessary to reverse the  chisel in this way a number of times, in order to remove the wire  edge, but the chisel should never be tipped so as to put any bevel at  all on its flat side. Finally, the edge is touched up (stropped) by  being drawn over a piece of leather a few times, first on one side,  then on the other, still continuing to hold the chisel so as to keep  the bevel perfect.    [Illustration: Fig. 78. Grinding Angle, 20 deg. Whetting Angle, 25 deg.]    To test the sharpness of a whetted edge, draw the tip of the finger  or thumb lightly along it, Fig. 79. If the edge be dull, it will feel  smooth: if it be sharp, and if care be taken, it will score the skin a  little, not enough to cut thru, but just enough to be felt.    [Illustration: Fig. 79. Testing the Sharpness of a Chisel.]    The _gouge_ is a form of chisel, the blade of which is concave, and  hence the edge curved. When the bevel is on the outside, the common  form, it is called an outside bevel gouge or simply a \"gouge,\" Fig.  80; if the bevel is on the inside, it is called an inside bevel, or  inside ground, or scribing-gouge, or paring-gouge, Fig. 81.[3]        [Footnote 3: Another confusing nomenclature (Goss) gives the name      \"inside gouges\" to those with the cutting edge on the inside, and      \"outside gouges\" to those with the cutting edge on the outside.]    Carving tools are, properly speaking, all chisels, and are of  different shapes for facility in carving.    For ordinary gouging, Fig. 82, the blade is gripped firmly by the left  hand with the knuckles up, so that a strong control can be exerted  over it. The gouge is manipulated in much the same way as the  chisel, and like the chisel it is used longitudinally, laterally, and  transversely.    In working with the grain, by twisting the blade on its axis as it  moves forward, delicate paring cuts may be made. This is particularly  necessary in working cross-grained wood, and is a good illustration of  the advantage of the sliding cut.    [Illustration: Fig. 80. Firmer-Gouge Outside Bevel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 81. Inside Bevel Gouge.]    In gouging out broad surfaces like trays or saddle seats it will  be found of great advantage to work laterally, that is across the  surface, especially in even grained woods as sweet gum. The tool is  not so likely to slip off and run in as when working with the grain.    The gouge that is commonly used for cutting concave outlines on end  grain, is the inside bevel gouge. Like the chisel in cutting convex  outlines, it is pushed or driven perpendicularly thru the wood laid  flat on a cutting board on the bench, as in perpendicular chiseling.  Fig. 72, p. 56.
