It was bad enough for a  man to be sent--for a consideration--by his own Government to a strange  land, but to pay for the journey one's self, why! it seemed to them too  preposterous for words. They had quite an excited discussion about it  among themselves, the Persian idea being that every man must sponge upon  the Government to the utmost extent.    The young Prince hoped that I would travel as his guest in his carriage  to Teheran. Unfortunately, however, I had made other arrangements, and  was unable to accept his invitation.    My visit ended with renewed salaams and good wishes on their part for my  welfare on the long journey I was about to undertake. I noticed that,  with the exception of the Prince, who shook my hand warmly, the Mullahs  bowed over and over again, but did not touch my hand.    Now for the business visit at the post station. After a good deal of talk  and an unlimited consumption of tea, it had been arranged that a landau  with four post horses to be changed every six farsakhs, at each post  station, and a _fourgon_--a large van without springs, also with four  horses,--for luggage, should convey me to Teheran. So little luggage is  allowed inside one's carriage that an additional _fourgon_ is nearly  always required. One is told that large packages can be forwarded at a  small cost by the postal service, and that they will reach Teheran soon  after the passengers, but unhappy is the person that tries the rash  experiment. There is nothing to guarantee him that he will ever see his  luggage again. In Persia, a golden rule while travelling, that may  involve some loss of time but will avoid endless trouble and worry in the  end, is never to let one's luggage go out of sight. One is told that the  new Teheran road is a Russian enterprise, and therefore quite reliable,  and so it is, but not so the company of transportation, which is in the  hands of natives, the firm of Messrs. Bagheroff Brothers, which is merely  subsidized by the Russian Road Company.    As every one knows, in 1893 the Russians obtained a concession to  construct a carriage-road from Piri-Bazaar _via_ Resht to Kasvin, an  extension to Hamadan, and the purchase of the road from Kasvin to  Teheran, which was already in existence. Nominally the concession was not  granted to the Russian Government itself--as is generally believed in  England--but to a private company--the \"Compagnie d'Assurance et de  Transport en Perse,\" which, nevertheless, is a mere off-shoot of  Government enterprise and is backed by the Russian Government to no mean  degree. The Company's headquarters are in Moscow, and in Persia the chief  office is at Kasvin.    Here it may be well to add that if this important concession slipped out  of our hands we have only ourselves to blame. We can in no way accuse the  Russians of taking advantage of us, but can only admire them for knowing  how to take advantage of a good opportunity. We had the opportunity  first; it was offered us in the first instance by Persia which needed a  loan of a paltry sixty million francs, or a little over two million  pounds sterling. The concession was offered as a guarantee for the loan,  but we, as usual, temporised and thought it over and argued--especially  the people who did not know what they were arguing about--and eventually  absolutely refused to have anything to do with the scheme. The Russians  had the next offer and jumped at it, as was natural in people well versed  in Persian affairs, and well able to foresee the enormous possibilities  of such an undertaking.    It was, beyond doubt, from the very beginning--except to people  absolutely ignorant and mentally blind--that the concession, apart from  its political importance, was a most excellent financial investment. Not  only would the road be most useful for the transit of Russian goods to  the capital of Persia, and from there all over the country, but for  military purposes it would prove invaluable. Maybe its use in the latter  capacity will be shown sooner than we in England think.    Of course, to complete the scheme the landing at Enzeli must still be  improved, so that small ships may enter in safety and land passengers and  goods each journey without the unpleasant alternative, which we have  seen, of having to return to one's point of departure and begin again,  two, or three, or even four times. One gentleman I met in Persia told me  that on one occasion the journey from Baku to Enzeli--thirty-six  hours--occupied him the space of twenty-six days!    [Illustration: Fourgons on the Russian Road between Resht and Teheran.]    The Caspian is stormy the greater part of the year, the water shallow, no  protection from the wind exists on any side, and wrecks, considering the  small amount of navigation on that sea, are extremely frequent. As we  have seen, there are not more than six feet of water on the bar at  Enzeli, but with a jetty which could be built at no very considerable  expense (as it probably will be some day) and a dredger kept constantly  at work, Enzeli could become quite a possible harbour, and the dangers of  long delays and the present risks that await passengers and goods, if not  absolutely avoided, would at least be minimised to an almost  insignificant degree. The navigation of the lagoon and stream presents no  difficulty, and the Russians have already obtained the right to widen the  mouth of the Murd-ap at Enzeli, in conjunction with the concession of the  Piri-Bazaar-Teheran road.    The road was very easy to make, being mostly over flat country and rising  to no great elevation, 5,000 feet being the highest point. It follows the  old caravan track nearly all the way, the only important detour made by  the new road being between Paichinar and Kasvin, to avoid the high  Kharzan or Kiajan pass--7,500 feet--over which the old track went.    Considering the nature of the country it crosses, the new road is a  good one and is well kept. Three large bridges and fifty-eight small ones  have been spanned across streams and ravines, the longest being the  bridge at Menzil, 142 yards long.    From Resht, _via_ Deschambe Bazaar, to Kudum the road strikes due south  across country. From Kudum (altitude, 292 feet) to Rudbar (665 feet) the  road is practically along the old track on the north-west bank of the  Kizil Uzen River, which, from its source flows first in a south-easterly  direction, and then turns at Menzil almost at a right angle towards the  north-east, changing its name into Sefid Rud (the White River). Some  miles after passing Rudbar, the river has to be crossed by the great  bridge, to reach Menzil, which lies on the opposite side of the stream.    From Menzil to Kasvin the Russian engineers had slightly more trouble in  constructing the road. A good deal of blasting had to be done to make the  road sufficiently broad for wheeled traffic; then came the important  detour, as we have seen, from Paichinar to Kasvin, so that practically  the portion of the road from Menzil to Kasvin is a new road altogether,  _via_ Mala Ali and Kuhim, the old track being met again at the village of  Agha Baba.    The width of the road averages twenty-one feet. In difficult places, such  as along ravines, or where the road had to be cut into the rock, it is  naturally less wide, but nowhere under fourteen feet. The gradient  averages 1--20 to 1--24. At a very few points, however, it is as steep  as 1 in 15. If the hill portion of the road is excepted, where, being in  zig-zag, it has very sharp angles, a light railway could be laid upon it  in a surprisingly short time and at no considerable expense, the ground  having been made very hard nearly all along the road.    The capital of L340,000 employed in the construction of the road was  subscribed in the following manner: 1,000 shares of 1,000 rubles each, or  1,000,000 rubles original capital subscribed in Moscow; 1,000,000 rubles  debentures taken by the Russian Government, and a further 500,000 rubles  on condition that 700,000 rubles additional capital were subscribed,  which was at once done principally by the original shareholders.    The speculation had from the very beginning a prospect of being very  successful, even merely considered as a trade route--a prospect which the  British Government, capitalist, and merchant did not seem to grasp, but  which was fully appreciated by the quicker and more far-seeing Russian  official and trader. Any fair-minded person cannot help admiring the  Russian Government for the insight, enterprise and sound statesmanship  with which it lost no time in supporting the scheme (discarded by us as  worthless), and this it did, not by empty-winded, pompous speeches and  temporising promises, to which we have so long been accustomed, but by  supplying capital in hard cash, for the double purpose of enhancing to  its fullest extent Russian trade and of gaining the strategic advantages  of such an enterprise, which are too palpable to be referred to again.    So it was, that while we in England relied on the everlasting and  ever-idiotic notion that Russia would never have the means to take up the  loan, being--as we are told--a bankrupt country with no resources, and a  Government with no credit and no cash,--that we found ourselves left (and  laughed at), having lost an opportunity which will never present itself  again, and which will eventually cost us the loss of Northern Persia, if  not of the whole of Persia.    Russia--it is only too natural--having once set her foot, or even both  feet, on Persian soil, now tries to keep out other nations--which, owing  to her geographical position, she can do with no effort and no  trouble--in order to enhance her youthful but solid and fast-growing  industries and trade.    In the case of the Teheran road, the only one, it must be remembered,  leading with any safety to the Persian capital, it is theoretically open  to all nations.

Christ and the Apostles, the Patriarchs and Prophets,  were the embodiment of living principles and of living ideals.  Tintoretto felt this so vividly that he could not think of them  otherwise than as people of his own kind, living under conditions easily  intelligible to himself and to his fellow-men. Indeed, the more  intelligible and the more familiar the look and garb and surroundings of  biblical and saintly personages, the more would they drive home the  principles and ideas they incarnated. So Tintoretto did not hesitate to  turn every biblical episode into a picture of what the scene would look  like had it taken place under his own eyes, nor to tinge it with his own  mood.    His conception of the human form was, it is true, colossal, although the  slender elegance that was then coming into fashion, as if in protest  against physical force and organisation, influenced him considerably in  his construction of the female figure; but the effect which he must  always have produced upon his contemporaries, and which most of his  works still produce, is one of astounding reality as well as of wide  sweep and power. Thus, in the \"Discovery of the Body of St. Mark,\" in  the Brera, and in the \"Storm Rising while the Corpse is being Carried  through the Streets of Alexandria,\" in the Royal Palace at Venice, the  figures, although colossal, are so energetic and so easy in movement,  and the effects of perspective and of light and atmosphere are so on a  level with the gigantic figures, that the eye at once adapts itself to  the scale, and you feel as if you too partook of the strength and health  of heroes.      =XVII. Value of Minor Episodes in Art.=--That feeling for reality which  made the great painters look upon a picture as the representation of a  cubic content of atmosphere enveloping all the objects depicted, made  them also consider the fact that the given quantity of atmosphere is  sure to contain other objects than those the artist wants for his  purpose. He is free to leave them out, of course, but in so far as he  does, so far is he from producing an effect of reality. The eye does not  see everything, but all the eye would naturally see along with the  principal objects, must be painted, or the picture will not look true  to life. This incorporation of small episodes running parallel with the  subject rather than forming part of it, is one of the chief  characteristics of modern as distinguished from ancient art. It is this  which makes the Elizabethan drama so different from the Greek. It is  this again which already separates the works of Duccio and Giotto from  the plastic arts of Antiquity. Painting lends itself willingly to the  consideration of minor episodes, and for that reason is almost as well  fitted to be in touch with modern life as the novel itself. Such a  treatment saves a picture from looking prepared and cold, just as light  and atmosphere save it from rigidity and crudeness.    No better illustration of this can be found among Italian masters than  Tintoretto's \"Crucifixion\" in the Scuola di San Rocco. The scene is a  vast one, and although Christ is on the Cross, life does not stop. To  most of the people gathered there, what takes place is no more than a  common execution. Many of them are attending to it as to a tedious duty.  Others work away at some menial task more or less connected with the  Crucifixion, as unconcerned as cobblers humming over their last. Most of  the people in the huge canvas are represented, as no doubt they were in  life, without much personal feeling about Christ. His own friends are  painted with all their grief and despair, but the others are allowed to  feel as they please. The painter does not try to give them the proper  emotions. If one of the great novelists of to-day, if Tolstoi, for  instance, were to describe the Crucifixion, his account would read as if  it were a description of Tintoretto's picture. But Tintoretto's fairness  went even further than letting all the spectators feel as they pleased  about what he himself believed to be the greatest event that ever took  place. Among this multitude he allowed the light of heaven to shine upon  the wicked as well as upon the good, and the air to refresh them all  equally. In other words, this enormous canvas is a great sea of air and  light at the bottom of which the scene takes place. Without the  atmosphere and the just distribution of light, it would look as lifeless  and desolate, in spite of the crowd and animation, as if it were the  bottom of a dried up sea.      =XVIII. Tintoretto's Portraits.=--While all these advances were being  made, the art of portraiture had not stood still. Its popularity had  only increased as the years went on. Titian was too busy with  commissions for foreign princes to supply the great demand there was in  Venice alone. Tintoretto painted portraits not only with much of the air  of good breeding of Titian's likenesses, but with even greater  splendour, and with an astonishing rapidity of execution. The Venetian  portrait, it will be remembered, was expected to be more than a  likeness. It was expected to give pleasure to the eye, and to stimulate  the emotions. Tintoretto was ready to give ample satisfaction to all  such expectations. His portraits, although they are not so  individualised as Lotto's, nor such close studies of character as  Titian's, always render the man at his best, in glowing health, full of  life and determination. They give us the sensuous pleasure we get from  jewels, and at the same time they make us look back with amazement to a  State where the human plant was in such vigour as to produce old men of  the kind represented in most of Tintoretto's portraits.    With Tintoretto ends the universal interest the Venetian school arouses;  for although painting does not deteriorate in a day any more than it  grows to maturity in the same brief moment, the story of the decay has  none of the fascination of the growth. But several artists remain to be  considered who were not of the Venetian school in the strict sense of  the term, but who have always been included within it.      =XIX. Venetian Art and the Provinces.=--The Venetian provinces were held  together not merely by force of rule. In language and feeling no less  than in government, they formed a distinct unit within the Italian  peninsula. Painting being so truly a product of the soil as it was in  Italy during the Renaissance, the art of the provinces could not help  holding the same close relation to the art of Venice that their language  and modes of feeling held. But a difference must be made at once between  towns like Verona, with a school of at least as long a growth and with  as independent an evolution as the school of Venice itself, and towns  like Vicenza and Brescia whose chief painters never developed quite  independently of Venice or Verona. What makes Romanino and Moretto of  Brescia, or even the powerful Montagna of Vicenza, except when they are  at their very best, so much less enjoyable as a rule than the  Venetians--that is to say the painters wholly educated in Venice,--is  something they have in common with the Eclectics of a later day. They  are ill at ease about their art, which is no longer the utterly  unpremeditated outcome of a natural impulse. They saw greater painting  than their own in Venice and Verona, and not unfrequently their own  works show an uncouth attempt to adopt that greatness, which comes out  in exaggeration of colour even more than of form, and speaks for that  want of taste which is the indelible stamp of provincialism. But there  were Venetian towns without the traditions even of the schools of  Vicenza and Brescia, where, if you wanted to learn painting, you had to  apprentice yourself to somebody who had been taught by somebody who had  been a pupil of one of Giovanni Bellini's pupils. This was particularly  true of the towns in that long stretch of plain between the Julian Alps  and the sea, known as Friuli. Friuli produced one painter of remarkable  talents and great force, Giovanni Antonio Pordenone, but neither his  talents nor his force, nor even later study in Venice, could erase from  his works that stamp of provincialism which he inherited from his first  provincial master.    Such artists as these, however, never gained great favour in the  capital. Those whom Venice drew to herself when her own strength was  waning and when, like Rome in her decline, she began to absorb into  herself the talent of the provinces, were rather painters such as Paolo  Veronese whose art, although of independent growth, was sufficiently  like her own to be readily understood, or painters with an entirely new  vein, such as the Bassani.      =XX. Paul Veronese.=--Paolo was the product of four or five generations of  Veronese painters, the first two or three of which had spoken the  language of the whole mass of the people in a way that few other artists  had ever done. Consequently, in the early Renaissance, there were no  painters in the North of Italy, and few even in Florence, who were not  touched by the influence of the Veronese. But Paolo's own immediate  predecessors were no longer able to speak the language of the whole mass  of the people. There was one class they left out entirely, the class to  whom Titian and Tintoretto appealed so strongly, the class that ruled,  and that thought in the new way. Verona, being a dependency of Venice,  did no ruling, and certainly not at all so much thinking as Venice, and  life there continued healthful, simple, unconscious, untroubled by the  approaching storm in the world's feelings. But although thought and  feeling may be slow in invading a town, fashion comes there quickly.  Spanish fashions in dress, and Spanish"]]]
