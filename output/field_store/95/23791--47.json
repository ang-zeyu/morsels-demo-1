Some thought that all would have exactly  the same perfections and virtues; that all would be equal and alike.    'Abdu'l-Baha said there would be variety, and differing degrees of  attainment, as in this world.    The question was then asked as to how it would be possible with no  material bodies or environment to recognize different entities and  characters, when all would be in the same conditions and on the same plane  of existence.    'Abdu'l-Baha said if several people look into a mirror at the same moment,  they behold all the different personalities, their characteristics and  movements; the glass of the mirror into which they look is one. In your  mind you have a variety of thoughts, but all these thoughts are separate  and distinct. Also you may perhaps have hundreds of friends; but when you  call them before your memory you do not confuse them one with another:  each one is separate and distinct, having their own individualities and  characteristics.    Replying to another questioner, he said that when two people, husband and  wife for instance, have been completely united in this life their souls  being as one soul, then after one of them has passed away, this union of  heart and soul would remain unbroken.            SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIP      In the evening of September 28th, 'Abdu'l-Baha was with a number of  assembled guests.    He said all of you here are sisters. Bodily relationships may pass; even  two sisters may be inimical to each other, but the spiritual relationship  is eternal, and brings about mutual love and service.    Be always kind to everyone and a refuge for those who are without shelter.    Be daughters to those who are older than you.    Be sisters to those who are of your own age.    Be mothers to those who are younger than yourselves.    Be nurses to the sick, treasurers for the poor, and supply heavenly food  to the hungry.    A Persian doctor from Qazvin said this was a great work of God that the  East and the West had become so united, and we must always thank God that  the Baha'i cause had produced such great harmony and union between us. The  result of this visit of 'Abdu'l-Baha to the West would be very great.            A BAHA'I WEDDING      Quite an oriental note was struck toward the end of 'Abdu'l-Baha's London  visit, by the marriage of a young Persian couple who had sought his  presence for the ceremony, the bride journeying from Baghdad accompanied  by her uncle in order to meet her fiance here and be married before  'Abdu'l-Baha's departure. The bride's father and grandfather had been  followers of Baha'u'llah during the time of his banishment.    We hesitate to alter the bridegroom's description of the service and  therefore print it in his own simple and beautiful language. It will serve  to show a side not touched on elsewhere, and without which no idea of his  visit is complete. We refer to the attitude of reverence with which people  from the East who came to see 'Abdu'l-Baha regard their great teacher.  They invariably rise and stand with bowed heads whenever he enters the  room.    Mirza Dawud writes:--    On Sunday morning, the 1st of October, 1911, A.D., equal to the 9th Tishi  5972 (Hebrew Era), Regina Nur Mahal _Kh_anum, and Mirza Yuhanna Dawud were  admitted into the holy presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha: may my life be a  sacrifice to Him!    After receiving us, 'Abdu'l-Baha said, \"You are very welcome and it makes  me happy to see you here in London.\"    Looking at me he said, \"Never have I united anyone in marriage before,  except my own daughters, but as I love you much, and you have rendered a  great service to the Kingdom of Abha, both in this country and in other  lands, I will perform your marriage ceremony today. It is my hope that you  may both continue in the blessed path of service.\"    Then, first, 'Abdu'l-Baha took Nur Mahal _Kh_anum into the next room and  said to her, \"Do you love Mirza Yuhanna Dawud with all your heart and  soul?\" She answered, \"Yes, I do.\"    Then 'Abdu'l-Baha called me to him and put a similar question, that is to  say, \"Do you love Nur Mahal _Kh_anum with all your heart and soul?\" I  answered \"Yes, I do.\" We re-entered the room together and 'Abdu'l-Baha  took the right hand of the bride and gave it into that of the bridegroom  and asked us to say after him, \"We do all to please God.\"    We all sat down and 'Abdu'l-Baha continued; \"Marriage is a holy  institution and much encouraged in this blessed cause. Now you two are no  longer two, but one. Baha'u'llah's wish is that all men be of one mind and  consider themselves of one great household, that the mind of mankind be  not divided against itself.    \"It is my wish and hope that you may be blessed in your life. May God help  you to render great service to the kingdom of Abha and may you become a  means of its advancement.    \"May joy be increased to you as the years go by, and may you become  thriving trees bearing delicious and fragrant fruits which are the  blessings in the path of service.\"    When we came out, all the assembled friends both of Persia and London  congratulated us on the great honour that had been bestowed upon us, and  we were invited to dine by the kind hostess.    After a little while we gathered around the table with him. During the  meal one of the friends asked 'Abdu'l-Baha how he enjoyed his stay in  London, and what he thought of the English people. I acted as interpreter.  'Abdu'l-Baha replied: \"I have enjoyed London very much and the bright  faces of the friends have delighted my heart. I was drawn here by their  unity and love. In the world of existence there is no more powerful magnet  than the magnet of love. These few days will pass away, but their import  shall be remembered by God's friends in all ages and in all lands.    \"There are living nations and dead nations. Syria lost its civilization  through lethargy of spirit. The English nation is a living one, and when  in this spiritual springtime the divine truth come forth with renewed  vitality, the English will be like fruitful trees, and the Holy Spirit  will enable them to flourish in abundance. Then will they gain not only  materially, but in that which is far more important, spiritual progress,  which will enable them to render a greater service to the world of  humanity.\"    Another asked why the teachings of all religions are expressed largely by  parables and metaphors and not in the plain language of the people.    'Abdu'l-Baha replied:--\"Divine things are too deep to be expressed by  common words. The heavenly teachings are expressed in parable in order to  be understood and preserved for ages to come. When the spiritually minded  dive deeply into the ocean of their meaning they bring to the surface the  pearls of their inner significance. There is no greater pleasure than to  study God's Word with a spiritual mind.\"    \"The object of God's teaching to man is that man may know himself in order  to comprehend the greatness of God. The Word of God is for agreement and  concord. If you go to Persia where the friends of Abha are many, you will  at once realize the unifying force of God's work. They are doing their  utmost to strengthen this bond of amity. There, people of different  nationalities gather in one meeting and chant the divine tablets with one  accord. It might be supposed that they were all brethren. We do not  consider anyone a stranger, for it is said by Baha'u'llah 'Ye are all the  rays of one sun; the fruits of one tree; and the leaves of one branch.' We  desire the true brotherhood of humanity. This shall be so, and it has  already begun. Praise to be God, the Helper, the Pardoner!\"            THE VISIT TO BRISTOL      'Abdu'l-Baha spent the week end of September 23rd to 25th, at the Clifton  Guest House at Clifton, Bristol.    On the first afternoon, while driving, he expressed much interest in rural  England, marvelling at the century-old trees, and the vivid green of the  woods and downs, so unlike the arid East. \"Though it is autumn it seems  like spring,\" he said. The houses with their little plots of ground,  suggested a quotation which 'Abdu'l-Baha gave from Baha'u'llah's writings  in which the latter alludes to each family having a house with a piece of  land. 'Abdu'l-Baha likened the country to the soul and the city to the  body of man, saying, \"The body without the soul cannot live. It is good,\"  he remarked, \"to live under the sky, in the sunshine and fresh air.\"  Observing a young woman who rode by on horseback with her hair flying free  and several who bicycled past on their bicycles unattended, he said, \"This  is the age of woman. She should receive the same education as her brother  and enjoy the same privilege; for all souls are equal before God. Sex, in  its relation to the exigencies of the physical plane, has no connection  with the Spirit. In this age of spiritual awakening, the world has entered  upon the path of progress into the arena of development, where the power  of the spirit surpasses that of the body. Soon the spirit will have  dominion over the world of humanity.\"    In the evening greetings were cabled to the Baha'is of Tihran informing  them of 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence in Bristol. He sent his love and wished  them to know that he was well and happy with the Clifton friends. This was  sent in reply to a cablegram previously received from Tihran  congratulating the people of the Guest House on his prospective visit.    Later on a general reception was held, ninety people coming to meet  'Abdu'l-Baha who spoke to them with impressive earnestness.    'Abdu'l-Baha said, \"You are very welcome. I have come far to see you. I  praise God that after forty years of waiting I am permitted at last to  come and bring my message. This is an assembly full of spirituality. Those  who are present have turned their hearts towards God. They are looking and  longing for glad tidings. We have gathered here by the power of the  Spirit,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#8)"],[1,"the addresses of some individuals and centers in South  Africa. He hopes that through contact with the friends her interest in the  Teachings will be considerably increased and she will be stimulated to  help in spreading their knowledge throughout South Africa.    The Guardian wishes you to keep in closest touch with her through  correspondence, and to send her suitable literature on the Cause, and to  endeavour to make her join actively the Faith.    Again with many thanks for introducing this lady who indeed seems to be a  most promising worker, and with loving greetings to all the friends in  Auckland.    Yours ever in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Beloved bless you and aid you to surmount all obstacles that may  stand in your path, and aid you to lend a fresh impetus to the work that  has been so splendidly initiated._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (33) May 17th, 1938      Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of the 19th ins., and is indeed  pleased to know that your visit to Cairo has been so happy and successful,  and that the friends have extended to you such a warm hospitality all  through your stay.[+E9]    He hopes this letter will find you well, and enjoying your visit to your  relatives and fellow-believers in England.    With loving remembrances, and renewed thanks for your message,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Beloved fulfil your heart's desire in the service of His Faith,  and enable you to promote effectively the interests of its new-born  institutions._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (34) December 20th, 1938      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Your very cordial message of the 17th November addressed to our beloved  Guardian has duly reached him, and he has noted with keen appreciation  indeed the desire you had expressed of visiting the Holy Shrines on your  way back to New-Zealand.    As you must have surely read in the newspapers, however, the general  situation in Palestine is at present so gravely disturbed as to make it  quite impossible for you to undertake this trip in the next few months,  and in view of this the Guardian would advise that you postpone your visit  until the November of next year, by which time, it is hoped, the situation  throughout the country will have sufficiently improved to permit you to  undertake this long-cherished pilgrimage. The Guardian, needless to say,  would be also most delighted to meet you, and to hear from you directly of  the news of the Cause in New-Zealand, and to discuss certain matters which  the N.S.A.(7) has asked you to present to him for his instructions.    Regarding your question whether there is any special ceremony which the  believers should perform when they wish to \"name\" a baby; the Teachings do  not provide for any ceremony whatever on such occasions. We have no  \"baptismal service\" in the Cause, such as the Christians have. There would  be no objection, however, for the friends to come together on such happy  occasions, provided they do not hold an official public ceremony, and  provided also they strictly avoid uniformity and rigidity in all such  practices. No rule whatsoever that would tend to be rigid and uniform  should be allowed in such secondary matters, particularly as there are no  specific instructions in the Teachings regarding them.    With the warmest good wishes of the Guardian to you and to the friends,  and assuring you again of his hearty welcome to visit the Holy Shrines  during next autumn, and with greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-worker:_    _I shall indeed grieve if the situation in Palestine should prevent our  meeting and prevent your pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines. I pray that this  may not be the case. I am so eager to meet you, and express in person my  deep and abiding sense of appreciation of the splendid and historic  services you have rendered. I will continue to pray for you from the  depths of my heart._    _Your true and grateful brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (35) March 20th, 1939      Dear Baha'i Sister,    I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your  letter dated February 25th, informing him of the date of your departure  from England, and your inability to defer your visit to Haifa till next  November. He regrets indeed that you should find it impossible to extend  your stay in Europe and come to Palestine in autumn, as the situation here  is now so tense and dangerous that there seems very little hope of any  real amelioration in security conditions to take place by next May.  General conditions throughout the country are, at present, even worse than  a month ago, and the tension is daily increasing.    In case, however, security is reestablished by the time you reach  Port-Said, you would be welcome to visit the Shrines, but the Guardian  would be still away.    Wishing you again a successful and happy return home, and with the renewed  assurance of the Guardian's prayers for your welfare, protection and  guidance,    Yours most sincerely,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-worker:_    _I deeply regret that the situation in Palestine has not yet improved as I  realize how eager you are to visit the Holy Shrines. If however when you  reach Port-Said it will at all be possible for you to visit the Shrine,  you will be most welcome, I assure you. May the Almighty fulfil the  dearest hope of your heart,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (36) August 3rd, 1941      Dear Baha'i Sister:    Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter to him of May 10th,  which just came.    He was, as already expressed in the cable he sent you, greatly impressed  by the statement in the Quarterly on the true Baha'i attitude at the  present time. It displayed a correctness of viewpoint, a courage, and a  loyalty to Baha'u'llah which has led him to disseminate it far and wide:  in the American News Letter, in the two Haifa News Letters, English and  Persian, etc. It was indeed a timely and most noble contribution to the  Faith.    The friends in both Australia and New Zealand seem to have developed a  most outstanding soundness in their relation to the teachings. This leads  Shoghi Effendi to believe that they will make great contributions to the  unfoldment of the world-wide aspects of the Faith.    His prayers are always with you, and he most deeply appreciates the  splendid services you are rendering the Cause, and will pray that the way  will open for you to do even greater work and in an ever widening field.    Please assure all the dear friends of Auckland of his loving remembrance  and his prayers for their work.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-worker:_    _I cannot refrain from adding a few words in person to assure you of my  lively appreciation of your constancy and of the distinctive services you  are so ably and devotedly rendering our beloved Faith. That you may be  able to extend their range is my fervent and constant prayer. Persevere,  and be confident and happy._    _Your true and grateful brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (37) December 19th, 1947      Dear Baha'i Brother:    Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 12th has been received,  and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. The previous letter  you mention cannot have reached him, as he always replies to letters from  the friends.    Your book[+E10] touches on a very important subject, and he regrets that  he cannot read it himself. His work is so pressing and multiplying so fast  that he invariably refuses to go over the manuscripts the friends send him  as he simply cannot attend to such things as well as all his other work.  You should send it to the Reviewing Com. in the U.S.A. and ask their  advice. Perhaps an outside publisher would be interested in it? The Baha'i  funds have such heavy demands made on them at present that even essential  literature must often wait to be published, unfortunately.    He fully appreciates the fact that the believers locally, in different  parts of the world, often feel that their political party is in many ways  striving to accomplish ideals akin to our Baha'i aims--but the fact  remains that the only way for the Baha'is to preserve their international  character, their unity and integrity, is for them individually to  sacrifice these desired political affiliations for the universal good and  protection of the Faith. There is no political party in existence with  whose platform we wholly agree, and we must abstain from membership in  such parties. Likewise people who join the Faith must have the courage and  conviction to leave their political affiliations behind.    There is no reason why this should cause enmity as they are not joining  another party, but a universal Faith striving for the advancement of the  entire human race. He thinks there is very little possibility of any  politician joining the Faith. The sacrifice of such individuals' personal  ambitions is too great a one for them to make. The condition of the world  today is such that it is obvious no political solution to its problems is  going to be found. We Baha'is must therefore concentrate on Baha'u'llah's  World Order--the true solution.    He assures you he will pray your teaching labours may be very successful.  He will also pray for your dear mother's welfare.    With warmest greetings,  R. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Assuring you of my loving prayers for your welfare and success in the  service of our beloved Faith,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (38) November 23rd, 1949      Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letter of October 28 has been received, and our beloved Guardian has  instructed me to answer you on his behalf.    First, let me say how very deeply he appreciates the services you have"]]]
