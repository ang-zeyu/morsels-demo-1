And if  our priesthood in the Brahmanas feel themselves in the pride of  spiritual power lifted above the rules of moral law, they are not in  practice indifferent to it. Their lives are for the most part gentle  and good. Though \"truth\" in the Brahmanas usually means only  accordance with the ritual and mystic teachings of the Triple Science,  it sometimes signifies even there veracity and honesty also.  Truthfulness in speech is the hall-mark of the Brahman, says  Haridrumata Gautama to Satyakama Jabala (Chhand. Up. IV. iv. 5); and  even in the Brahmanas a lie is sometimes a sin. If conservatism  compels the priests to keep obscene old practices in their rituals,  they are not always satisfied with them, and voices begin to be heard  pleading that these rites are really obsolete. In short, a moral sense  is beginning to arise among them.    Now the moral law, in order that it may be feared, needs to be  embodied in the personality of a god. Most of their gods inspire no  fear at all in the souls of the Brahmans; but there is one of whom  they have a dread, which is all the greater for being illogical.  Prajapati is a vast impersonality, too remote and abstract to inspire  the soul with either fear or love. The other gods--Indra, Agni, Soma,  Varuna, Vishnu, and the rest--are his offspring, and are moved like  puppets by the machinery of the ritual of sacrifice created by him.  However much they may seem to differ one from another in their  attributes and personalities, they are in essence one and negligible  in the eyes of the master of the ritual lore. In the beginning, say  the Brahmanas, all the gods (except Prajapati, of course) were alike,  and all were mortal; then they performed sacrifices and thereby became  immortal, each with his peculiar attributes of divinity.[18] Thus at  bottom they are all the same thing, merely phases of the universal  godhead, waves stirred up by the current of the cosmic sacrifice. They  have no terrors for the priesthood. But there is one deity who  obstinately refuses to accommodate himself to this convenient point of  view, and that is Rudra, or Siva. By rights and logically he ought to  fall into rank with the rest of the gods; but there is a crossgrained  element in his nature which keeps him out. As we have seen, he comes  from a different source: in origin he was a demon, a power of terror,  whose realm of worship lay apart from that of the gods of higher  class, and now, although it has extended into the domains of orthodox  religion, an atmosphere of dread still broods over it.[19] Rudra  wields all his ancient terrors over a much widened area. The priests  have assigned him a regular place in their liturgies, and fully  recognise him in his several phases as Bhava, Sarva, Ugra, Maha-deva  or the Great God, Rudra, Isana or the Lord, and Asani or the  Thunderbolt (KB. VI. 2-9). Armed with his terrors, he is fit to be  employed in the service of conscience. Hence a myth has arisen that in  order to punish Prajapati for his incest with his daughter the gods  created Bhuta-pati (who is Pasu-pati or Rudra under a new name), who  stabbed him. The rest of the myth is as immaterial to our purpose as  it is unsavoury; what is important is that the conscience of the  Brahmans was beginning to feel slight qualms at the uncleanness of  some of their old myths and to look towards Rudra as in some degree an  avenger of sin. In this is implied an immense moral advance.  Henceforth there will be a gradual ennoblement of one of the phases of  the god's character. Many of the best minds among the Brahmans will  find their imaginations stirred and their consciences moved by  contemplation of him. To them he will be no more a mere demon of the  mountain and the wild. His destructive wrath they will interpret as  symbolising the everlasting process of death-in-life which is the  keynote of nature; in his wild dances they will see imaged forth the  everlasting throb of cosmic existence; to his terrors they will find a  reverse of infinite love and grace. The horrors of Rudra the deadly  are the mantle of Siva the gracious. Thus, while the god's character  in its lower phases remains the same as before, claiming the worship  of the basest classes of mankind, and nowise rising to a higher level,  it develops powerfully and fruitfully in one aspect which attracts  grave and earnest imaginations. The Muni, the contemplative ascetic,  penetrates in meditation through the terrors of Siva's outward form to  the god's inward love and wisdom, and beholds in him his own divine  prototype. And so Siva comes to be figured in this nobler aspect as  the divine Muni, the supreme saint and sage.    [Footnote 18: For the original mortality of the gods see TS. VII. iv.  2, 1, SB. X. iv. 33 f., XI. i. 2, 12, ii. 3, 6; for their primitive  non-differentiation, TS. VI. vi. 8, 2, SB. IV. v. 4, 1-4.]    [Footnote 19: Cf. e.g. KB. III. 4 & 6, VI. 2-9, and Ap. SS. VI. xiv.  11-13.]    While the worship of Siva is slowly making its way into the heart of  Brahmanic ritualism, another movement is at work which is gradually  drawing many of the keenest intellects among the Brahmans away from  the study of ritual towards an idealistic philosophy which views all  ritual with indifference. Its literature is the Upanishads.    The passing of the Rigvedic age has left to the Brahmans a doctrinal  legacy, which may be thus restated: a single divine principle through  a prototypic sacrifice has given birth to the universe, and all the  processes of cosmic nature are controlled by sacrifices founded upon  that primeval sacrifice. In short, the ritual symbolises and in a  sense actually _is_ the whole cosmic process. The ritual implies both  the knowledge of the law of sacrifice and the proper practice of that  law, _both understanding and works_. This is the standpoint of the  orthodox ritualist. But there has also arisen a new school among the  Brahmans, that of the Aupanishadas, which has laid down for its first  doctrine that _works are for the sake of understanding_, that the  practice of ritual is of value only as a help to the mystic knowledge  of the All. But here they have not halted; they have gone a further  step, and declared that _knowledge once attained, works become  needless_. Some even venture to hint that perhaps the highest  knowledge is not to be reached through works at all. And the knowledge  that the Aupanishadas seek is of Brahma, and _is_ Brahma.    The word _brahma_ is a neuter noun, and in the Rig-veda it means  something that can only be fully translated by a long circumlocution.  It may be rendered as \"the power of ritual devotion\"; that is to say,  it denotes the mystic or magic force which is put forth by the  poet-priest of the Rig-veda when he performs the rites of sacrifice  with appropriate chanting of hymns--in short, ritual magic. This  mystic force the Rigvedic poets have represented in personal form as  the god Brihaspati, in much the same way as they embodied the spirit  of the sacrifice in Vishnu. Their successors, the orthodox ritualists  of the Brahmanas, have not made much use of this term; but sometimes  they speak of Brahma as an abstract first principle, the highest and  ultimate source of all being, even of Prajapati (Samav. B. I. 1, Gop.  B. I. i. 4); and when they speak of Brahma they think of him not as a  power connected with religious ceremony but as a supremely  transcendent and absolutely unqualified and impersonal First  Existence. But the school of the Aupanishadas has gone further.  Seeking through works mystic knowledge as the highest reality, they  see in Brahma the perfect knowledge. To them the absolute First  Existence is also transcendently full and unqualified Thought. As  knowledge is power, the perfect Power is perfect Knowledge.    Brahma then is absolute knowledge; and all that exists is really  Brahma, one and indivisible in essence, but presenting itself  illusively to the finite consciousness as a world of plurality, of  most manifold subjects and objects of thought. The highest wisdom, the  greatest of all secrets, is to know this truth, to realise with full  consciousness that there exists only the One, Brahma, the infinite  Idea; and the sage of the Upanishads is he who has attained this  knowledge, understanding that he himself, as individual subject of  thought, is really identical with the universal Brahma. He has  realised that he is one with the Infinite Thought, he has raised  himself to the mystic heights of transcendental Being and Knowledge,  immeasurably far above nature and the gods. He knows all things at  their fountain-head, and life can nevermore bring harm to him; in his  knowledge he has salvation, and death will lead him to complete union  with Brahma.    The Aupanishadas have thus advanced from the pantheism of the orthodox  ritualists to a transcendental idealism. The process has been gradual.  It was only by degrees that they reached the idea of salvation in  knowledge, the knowledge that is union with Brahma; and it was  likewise only through slow stages that they were able to conceive of  Brahma in itself. Many passages in the Upanishads are full of  struggles to represent Brahma by symbols or forms perceptible to the  sense, such as ether, breath, the sun, etc. Priests endeavoured to  advance through ritual works to the ideas which these works are  supposed to symbolise: the ritual is the training-ground for the  higher knowledge, the leading-strings for infant philosophy. Gradually  men become capable of thinking without the help of these symbols:  philosophy grows to manhood, and looks with a certain contempt upon  those supports of its infancy.    The nature of Brahma as conceived in the Upanishads is a subject on  which endless controversies have raged, and we need not add to them.  Besides, the Upanishads themselves are not strictly consistent on this  point, or on others, for that matter; for they are not a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#8)"],[1,"no sermon. When the unbaptized were gone the tiny  church, that had seemed so thronged and stifling, grew to be  roomy and cool.    That was to me a very beautiful rendering of the Liturgy. Yet I  only understood a word here and there. I could follow the action  of the Divine Pageant throughout, and I would not have had the  mystery and aloofness of the words one whit lessened.    After it was over Reeve took me across to the native teacher's  house, where we found a very shy wife and a very composed baby to  greet us. Meanwhile the husband bustled about and gave us tea. I  liked his laugh and his boyish face, as well as his Biblical  English. He did not stint the tea in his blue pot. Soon we were  on our way back to my camp.    Jack had got a real good fire now in the shelter of the rocks,  and a hearty smell of fish frying reassured me as we drew near.    Reeve, who had seemed a little tired and washed out as we came  away from the church, now brightened up marvelously.    'I declare,' he said, 'it's just like old times. You know the  Tooting Road, where I used to work? It's just like the fried-fish  shop there, next door to the Surrey Arms. If we'd only got the  fog and the trams and a few of the old people here how fine it'd  be!'    We had found a subject that interested us both and lasted most of  the breakfast-time. His enthusiasm struck me as a little too  emphatic. I remarked that I thought he was well out of the  Tooting Road and out under blue sky on an African moorland.    'Look up there!' I said. 'That makes the Tooting Road seem rather  monstrous when one comes to think of it.' I pointed to the many  cattle and sheep and goats coming down to the stream at a  swinging pace through the gleaming woodland.    Two little boys were mounted on bulls; two or three others came  rushing behind. There was a barking of dogs and an ecstasy of  shouting.    'Oh, it's all very well,' he said, and his eyes flashed a little  scornfully.    Afterwards he took me to his home. His church stood out nobly as  we came up the path towards it. Within it was beautifully kept,  but I confess I was disappointed. It was all very neat, but it  suggested the skill of the church-furnishing firm too strongly. I  sighed a little as he showed me four enormous brazen vases of a  too familiar type. I longed for the two or three little red and  black earthen vases that I had seen on his teacher's altar; but I  kept my longing to myself.    He was a marvelous man for method, Leonard Reeve. He seemed to me  to organize classes with real talent anybody who came to the  Mission at all habitually was pigeon-holed as 'Inquirer,'  'Hearer,' 'Catechumen,' 'Under a cloud,' or something else, and  dealt with accordingly. His work, as I watched it day by day, and  evening by evening in church and school and villages and Mission  farm seemed to me well-considered and painstaking. On the other  hand he seemed to me not so happy, and not so very well.    The mail came in on the Monday.    I was to start the following Thursday for the railroad on my way  to my home again. We gloated over the letters and papers that  evening it was really a superb mail. The native boy with the bag  (I remember he was lanky and handsome and wore a rose-and-blue  zephyr) came up just as we stood in the avenue leading to the  house. We were smoking our pipes and arguing. The sun was almost  down.    What were we arguing about? Oh, he was arguing rather recklessly  about the glories of town-work. I retorted with few words, but  strong ones, in favor of work out in the country. Once I pressed  him rather inquisitively and mischievously as to his present work  on the veld. 'How can you hold such views and do it?' I asked him  point-blank. Thereat the fine side of the man showed.    His face flushed and his lips quivered. 'It's my job,' he said,  'and I'm not going to talk against it. I was arguing about  country-work in the abstract over there in England.' Then it was  that the boy came in sight with the letters. Reeve looked up and  watched him with real pleasure and gratitude. He said something  to him in the native language that seemed to amuse the boy very  much. I had thought his manners towards his flock very courteous,  but cold. I noticed a new tenderness now and from this night  forward.    I could read him like a book, this town-lover so I thought. He  had said too much to me, he had avowed to me his want of  affection for his work in so many words, and now he was on the  watch against himself, and burning to render reparation to a very  quick conscience.    He had a big mail, but he was not communicative about it. Indeed  we had not much time for our letters just then. We had Evensong  soon after sunset, then there was a class for catechumens that I  attended. I could not understand much, but it was good to watch  how they listened, all but the vigorous mail-boy, who nodded at  whiles unless I am mistaken. Afterwards we had a meal. It was by  mutual agreement that we read our letters over our bread and tea  and cheese. I read one of my letters with some indignation. It  was a letter from my schoolmaster, who was not very encouraging  on the subject of my locum tenens' industry.    'I thought I had got a first-rate man in Cochrane,' I said aloud.    'Cochrane of Peckham Downs?' asked Reeve, looking up and eyeing  me. 'What about him? Yes, I should say he was in his way quite  first-rate.'    'I'm glad to hear it, but I wish he would find country work more  congenial. My correspondent says he's quite got the hump about  our village.'    Leonard smiled. 'Some villages do tend to give people like  Cochrane and me the hump,' he said. 'But of course yours is  different.' 'Of course it is. Come and see it some day.' His  mouth twitched. 'If I get home-leave in two years' time,' he  said. 'I don't want to spend it in the country, not any of it,  thank you all the same. I like the town much too well.'    'The smell of the shop you named attracts you just like thyme  does me.'    'Yes,' he said, with a rather wry smile and a very real sigh.    Then we went on reading till bed-time. In the morning Lorenzo,  his house-boy, knocked me up just as the sun was rising. 'The  father is very sick,' he said. So he was very bad indeed with  fever, at least so it seemed to me. But I am not used to nursing  that malady. I think his temperature was 103 that day, which may  seem a modest figure to a pioneer, but struck a chance visitor as  none too reassuring. However, I kept my anxieties to myself, and  looked after him quietly. He said there was no need to worry  about a doctor. That night he seemed to be delirious, and talking  at large. I made up my mind I would send for the doctor in the  morning if his symptoms should last. But they did not. He  appeared to be quiet and sensible at sunrise, and his temperature  was a normal one. The morning after that, again, he seemed so  well that I left him with a fairish conscience on my return  journey for England. I want to tell you about that anxious night.  He gave himself away then. I don't think he remembered much  of what he had said next morning. It seemed sad to me his  self-revelation. He said he did not know what in the world to do,  he felt so ill and anxious. He was a Cockney born, and he had  loved his South London work. He really wanted to tackle the job in  front of him here. But the romance was there behind him in that  English city the unique sense of being in the right place the  great adventure the gleam.    Oh! why had he caught the fever? Not this fever, but the malaria  of Imperialism, and felt drawn to go so very far afield. He  didn't abuse the veld, the camping-out, the foot-slogging, the  primitive people. He was a very chivalrous person even in his  delirium.    But he spoke ecstatically of the streets, the tram-roads, the  lights of the town, the smartness of his flock, the delights of  their up-to-date humor.    The tragedy thickened. He told me of her who had promised to  marry him by Eastertide next year. Cecilia was her name.    She was a Londoner, and shared his views. 'Whatever will she  think of this place?' he asked. My eyes wandered to the iron  roof, to the floor-boarded walls, to the candle in a bottle that  fought the draught so bravely. He told me about a letter of hers  he had got by this mail. She had been working as a governess  these last few months at a country rectory in the Berkshire  moors. She found the village, and the neighborhood, and the life  there in general very flat indeed. They bored her; yet she was  keen, he said, on 'the work,' 'the work' as she had known it when  she worked for him in London. 'Whatever will she think of this  place?' he repeated. I looked at the floor, freshly treated with  cow-dung, and thought again for an answer, but I could think of  no very suitable one.    'I'll give you her letter to read,' he said, in a burst of  confidence. 'That puts it far more plainly than I can. My head's  so bad.' He looked worried, and I thought I had better leave him.    'No,' he said; 'do read to me a bit before you go.'    'What shall I read?'    He looked at me meditatively. 'You'll find something to the point  in there,' he said. He reached up to the little candle-box  bookcase over his head, and showed me a little crimson book. It  was an anthology. I should think it might be commendably put on  the 'Index Expurgatorius' of upcountry missionaries.    It was called 'The Cheerful City,' and dwelt on the delights of  civilization and urbanity. Doubtless it may serve a useful  purpose, thought I, in reconciling Londoners to their wen; but,  here, what does it spell for my delirious Cockney save only  desiderium?    I read him two or three selections obediently, but without  enthusiasm. Were they from Herrick and Charles Lamb? I rather  think they were.    Afterwards he asked me for a few verses of the Gospel. I cheered  up.    'What would you like?'    'Oh, that story at the"]]]
