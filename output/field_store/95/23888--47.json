That evening was passed  _tete-a-tete_ with comte Jean; he thought, as I did, that the foundation  of our treasure was firm as a rock, and he gave me many counsels for the  future which I promised to observe; for indeed it was to my own interest  to do so. Upon how many follies did we then debate, which, but a few  days afterwards we found practicable. The different ministers passed in  review before us; some we determined upon retaining, whilst others were  dismissed, and already I began in idea to act with sovereign power over  these illustrious personages, amongst whom I anticipated shortly playing  so important a part. \"After all,\" said I, \"the world is but an amusing  theatre, and I see no reason why a pretty woman should not play a  principal part in it.\"        CHAPTER III      The king's message--Letter from the countess--A second supper at  Versailles--The duc d'Ayen--A short account of M. de Fleury--The duc de  Duras--Conversation with the king--The next day--A visit from the duc  de Richelieu--Visit from the duc de la Vauguyon--Visit from comte  Jean--Visit from the king--A third supper--Favor    Early the following day I received a message from the king, accompanied  with a bouquet of flowers tied round with a string of diamonds. A short  letter was annexed to this splendid gift, which I would transcribe here,  had it not been taken from me with many others. My reply, which I wrote  upon the spur of the moment, was concise, and, as I preserved the rough  copy, under the impression of its being one day useful, I can give the  reader the exact words.    \"The billet traced by your noble hands, renders me the happiest of  women. My joy is beyond description. Thanks, monsieur le Baron, for your  charming flowers. Alas! they will be faded and withered by to-morrow,  but not so fleeting and short-lived are the sentiments with which you  have inspired me. Believe me, the desire you express to see me again  is entirely mutual; and in the impatience with which you await our next  interview, I read but my own sentiments. The ardor with which you long  to embrace me, is fully equalled by the affection which leads me to  desire no gratification greater than that of passing my whole life in  your society. Adieu, monsieur le baron; you have forbidden my addressing  you as your rank and my respect would have me, I will therefore content  myself with assuring you of the ardent affection of the        \"COMTESSE Du Barry.\"    The signature I adopted was a bold piece of falsehood, but it was too  late to recede; besides, I was addressing myself in my letter, not to  the king, but to the baron de Gonesse; for Louis, by I know not what  unaccountable caprice, seemed to wish to preserve his incognito. I have  since learned that Francis I assumed the same name, altho' upon a very  different occasion. Replying to a letter from Charles V, in which that  emperor had given himself a long string of high sounding titles, he  contented himself with simply signing his letter, _\"Francois, baron de  Gonesse._\" Louis XV was very fond of borrowed appellations. Unlike the  vanity so common to mankind, of seeking to set off their pretensions  by assumed titles, it is the pleasure of royalty to descend to a lower  grade in society when concealment becomes desirable, either from policy  or pleasure; and Louis sought in the familiarity in which a plain baron  might safely indulge, a relief from the ennui attendant upon the rigid  etiquette of a regal state. I had omitted in my letter to the baron,  to remind him that we were to meet that very evening, but that did not  prevent my repairing to Versailles punctually at the appointed hour. I  was conducted into the same apartment as before, where I found the same  females who had then assisted at my toilet* again prepared to lend their  aid; and from this moment I had a regular establishment of attendants  appointed for my use.         * A word of which the meaning has greatly changed over the       last two centuries.  Here it means putting on her clothing,       makeup, jewelry, and so forth.  Through most of this book it       is spelled \"toilette\".--Transcriber    The moment the king was informed of my arrival, unable to restrain his  impatience, he hastened to me to assist at my dressing table, and he  continued standing beside me so long as the operation lasted; I felt  greatly embarrassed, not knowing whether I durst take the liberty of  requesting him to be seated. However, my silence on the subject was  greatly admired, and ascribed to my perfect acquaintance with polished  life, when in reality it originated from mere timidity. My triumph was  complete; the monarch smiled at and admired every word as it fell from  my lips, kissed my hands, and played with the curls of my long hair,  sportively twisting his fingers amidst my flowing ringlets with all  the vivacity of a lover of twenty. The company upon this evening was  different from that of the former occasion, consisting of the duc de  Duras, first gentleman of the bedchamber, and the duc d'Ayen, who had  the reputation of being a great wit; however, in my opinion, he was  much more deserving the character of a real fiend; his very breath  was poisonous, and his touch venomous as the bite of an adder. I well  remember what M. de Fleury said of him to the king in my presence.  \"Sire,\" said he, \"the thing I most dread in the world next to a bite  from M. d'Ayen, is the bite of a mad dog.\" For my own part, I did not  in the end look upon him with less terror, and well he paid me for my  fears. Upon one occasion, when the king was speaking of me to him, he  said, \"I am well aware that I succeed St. Foix.\"    \"Yes, sire\"; replied the duke, \"in the same manner as your majesty  succeeds Pharamond!\"    I never forgave him those words, dictated by a fiendish malice. However,  upon the evening of my first introduction to him, he behaved to me with  the most marked politeness. I was then an object of no consequence to  his interests, and his vision had not yet revealed to him the height I  was destined to attain. He looked upon me but as one of those meteors  which sparkled and shone in the castle at Versailles for twenty-four  hours, and sank to rise no more.    The duc de Duras was not an ill-disposed person, but inconceivably  stupid; indeed, wit was by no means a family inheritance. Both father  and son, good sort of people in other respects, were for ever saying or  doing some good thing in support of their reputation for stupidity at  court. One day the king quite jokingly inquired of the duc de Duras,  what was done with the old moons. \"Upon my word, sire,\" replied he,  \"I can give you no idea, never having seen, but with your majesty's  permission, I will endeavor to learn from M. de Cassini*!\" To such a  pitch did the poor man's simplicity extend. Both father and son were  nominated to attend the king of Denmark, when on his road to visit  France. The king observed to a person who repeated it to me: \"The French  are generally styled a clever, witty nation; I cannot say I should ever  have been able to discover it, had I been tempted to form my opinion  from the specimen they have sent me.\"          *The royal astronomer--Transcriber    As far as I am concerned, after saying so many unfavorable things of the  Messrs. de Duras, I must do them the justice to say, that their conduct  towards me was everything that could be desired. I was always glad to  see them; it gave my own imagination a sort of sedative dose to converse  with these two simple-minded beings, whose interests I was always ready  to promote by every means in my power, and I trust the memory of what I  have done will be long remembered by the noble house of Duras.    This supper did not pass off so gaily as the former one. The duc de  Duras spoke as little as possible, in the dread of making some unlucky  speech, and the duc d'Ayen sat devouring the spleen he could not  give vent to, and meditating fresh objects upon whom to exercise his  malignity; he vainly endeavored to lead me on to make some ridiculous  observation, but without success; happily for him, the king did not  perceive his aim. My royal lover was indeed so entirely engrossed by me,  that he lost all the duke's manoeuvres; his transports appeared too much  for his senses to sustain, and he vowed that I should never quit him  more, but remain to be elevated by his power to the first place at  court. At the monarch's sign, the two guests withdrew.    When the duc d'Ayen quitted the room, \"That nobleman is by no means to  my taste,\" said I to the king, \"he has the air of a spy, who wishes me  no good.\"    \"Do you really think so, my lovely comtesse?\"    \"I am certain of it; and I already shudder at the bare anticipation of  an enemy having access to your majesty's ear.\"    \"Reassure yourself,\" said the king, with the utmost tenderness, \"in me  you have a sure defender, who will never forsake you; look upon me from  this minute as your natural protector, and woe to him on whose head your  displeasure shall fall.\"    After this conversation the king and myself retired to rest, and when he  quitted me in the morning, he entreated me not to return to Paris, but  to give him my company for a whole week. Lebel made his appearance to  beg I would consider myself mistress of the apartments I occupied, and  that he had received orders to provide me with an establishment upon the  most handsome scale.    That very day Henriette, whom I had sent for, and instituted as my head  waiting-woman, informed me, that an old gentleman, attired as tho' for a  grand gala, but who refused to send in his name, begged to be permitted  to pay his respects. I bade her admit him; it was the duc de Richelieu.    \"Madame la comtesse,\" said he, bowing low, \"I come to complain of your  want of condescension; unless, indeed, your memory has been at fault.  Was it possible that when I had the honor of supping "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#8)"],[1,"the Great Serpent, and he told  him how to plant these sacrifices.    43. From the home of KlictsÃ² they went to a place called Tse`binÃ yol  (Wind Circles Around a Rock). When they drew near the place they heard  loud peals of thunder and the lightning struck close to them in four  different places. They were now approaching the home of the lightning  gods; this is why destruction by the thunderbolt seemed to threaten  them. Then the Navajo spoke to the lightning, as he had formerly spoken  to the whirlwind, saying, \"'Tis I, Reared Within the Mountains. Who art  thou?\" whereat the thunder and the lightning ceased, and the travelers  walked on until they entered a house of black clouds, inside of a  mountain, which was the house of I`Â¢nÃ¬`, the Lightning. He was bald,  like the Great Serpent, having only a little tuft of hair over each ear.  At each of the four sides of the room where I`Â¢nÃ¬` sat was a lightning  bird; that in the east was black, that in the south was blue, that in  the west, yellow, and that in the north, white. From time to time the  birds flashed lightning from their claws to the center of the room where  the god sat, and the lightning was of the same color as the bird that  emitted it. When the travelers entered I`Â¢nÃ¬` said to Niltci, \"Who is  this that you have brought with you?\" The latter answered, \"It is a  Navajo who has been a captive with the Ute and has escaped. He has  suffered much. See how his knees and ankles are swollen.\" Then the  Lightning showed him two kethÃ wns, such as the shamans now sacrifice  under the name of I`Â¢nÃ¬`-bikeÃ§an, or sacrificial sticks of the  lightning, and, having instructed him how to make and to plant these, he  bade his visitors depart.    44. The next place they reached on their journey was SÃ Ã¯ byitsÃ²zi  (Narrow Sand Hills). They entered the hill and came to the house of  KaÂ¢lÃ¹gi, the Butterfly, a dwelling filled with butterflies and rainbows.  They found KaÂ¢lÃ¹gi and his wife sitting there, and also AtsÃ²s-bebagÃ ni  (House of Feathers), who wore black leggings. Here Niltci disappeared  and the woman had to put her questions to the Navajo. She inquired, as  the others had done, who he was, and he briefly told her his story. She  arose, went out, and presently returned with a large basin made of a  beautiful white shell; this was filled with water and soap root. She  laid it before the Navajo, saying, \"You are about to visit some fair and  beautiful people, and it is proper that you should bathe your body and  wash your hair well.\" When he had finished his bath he of the house of  feathers took fine corn meal and applied it to the feet, the knees, the  abdomen, and the other parts of the body which are usually touched in  healing ceremonies. Then, under the directions of AtsÃ²s-bebagÃ ni, the  Navajo rubbed his whole body with meal to dry himself and painted his  face white with glee (white earth}. House of Feathers next brought in  small bundles of the following plants: tcilÂ¢elgÃ­si (_Gutierrezia  euthamiÃ¦_), Ã§oikal (_Artemesia trifida_), tsÃ©ji, and tlo`nasÃ§Ã¡si  (_Bouteloua hirsuta_), burned them to charcoal, and directed the Indian  to blacken his legs and forearms with this substance. When this was done  he put spots of white on the black, and, in short, painted him as the  akÃ¡ninili, or courier (Fig. 52) sent out to summon guests to the dance,  is painted to this day in the ceremonies of the dsilyÃ­dje qaÃ§Ã l. When  the painting was done KaÂ¢lÃ¹gi EsÃ§Ã¡ya (Butterfly Woman) took hold of his  hair and pulled it downward and stretched it until it grew in profusion  down to his ankles. Then she pressed and worked his body and face all  over until she molded him into a youth of the most beautiful form and  feature. They gave him fine white moccasins and a collar of beaver skin  with a whistle attached to it; they put the kÃ basÃ§an, or plumed sticks  to represent wings, on his arms, and altogether dressed and adorned him  as the akÃ¡ninili is dressed and adorned. The woman gave him white corn  meal mixed with water to eat, and he slept all night in the house of the  butterflies. In the morning the woman (or goddess, as we might better  call her) laid two streaks of white lightning on the ground and bade him  stand on them with one foot on each streak. \"Now,\" she said, \"the white  lightning is yours; use it how and when you will.\" Then she told him to  go to the top of the hill in which their house lay. When he ascended he  found another house on the top, and in it he again met KaÂ¢lÃ¹gi and his  wife, who awaited him there. He observed a streak of white lightning  that spanned a broad valley, stretching from the hill on which he stood  to a distant wooded mountain. \"There,\" said KaÂ¢lÃ¹gi EsÃ§Ã¡ya, pointing to  the lightning, \"is the trail you must follow. It leads to yonder  mountain, which is named BistcÃ gi.\"    45. He followed the lightning trail and soon arrived at the house of  EstsÃ u-Â¢igÃ¬ni (Holy Woman). The house was inside of a black mountain;  but the lightning ended not until it went quite into the dwelling; so he  had only to follow it to find his way in. The door was of trees. Within,  on the east wall hung the sun and on the west wall hung the moon. Here  he was shown the kethÃ wn which is called EstsÃ n-Â¢igÃ¬nibikeÃ§Ã n, or the  sacrificial stick of the holy woman, and was told how to make it and how  to bury it. As he was about to depart from this place two of the wind  gods and the butterfly god appeared to him, and the whole party of four  set out for TcÃ¹ckai (Chusca Knoll of our geographers).    46. At this place they entered a house which was inside of the mountain.  It was two stories high; it had four rooms on the first story and four  on the second. It had four doorways, which were covered with trees for  doors; in the east was a black spruce tree, in the south a blue spruce  tree, in the west a yellow spruce tree, and in the north a white shining  spruce tree. Here dwelt four of the TcikÃ¨-cac-nÃ¡tlehi (Maiden that  Becomes a Bear). Their faces were white; their legs and forearms were  covered with shaggy hair; their hands were like those of human beings;  but their teeth were long and pointed. The first TcikÃ¨-cac-nÃ¡tlehi, it  is said, had twelve brothers. She learned the art of converting herself  into a bear from the coyote. She was a great warrior and invulnerable.  When she went to war she took out and hid her vital organs, so that no  one could kill her; when the battle was over she put them back in their  places again. The maidens showed him how to make four kethÃ wns and told  him how to bury them in order to properly sacrifice them.    47. From TcÃ¹ckai they went to NinÃ -qoÂ¢ezgÃ²Ã§ (Valley Surrounded on All  Sides by Hills), near [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, where they found the house of the  TsilkÃ¨-Â¢igÃ¬ni (Holy Young Men), of whom there were four. There were, in  the dwelling, four rooms, which had not smooth walls, but looked like  rooms in a cavern; yet the house was made of water. A number of plumed  arrows (kÃ¡tso-yisÃ§Ã n) were hanging on the walls, and each young man  (standing one in the east, one in the south, one in the west, and one in  the north) held such an arrow in his extended right hand. No kethÃ wn was  given him; but he was bidden to observe well how the holy young warriors  stood, that he might imitate them in the rites he should establish  amongst men.    48. The next place they visited was Tse`Ã§a-iskÃ¡gi (Rock that Bends  Back), where they entered a house, striped within horizontally of many  colors, and found eight more of the TsilkÃ¨-Â¢igÃ¬ni (Holy Young Men). Two  stood at each cardinal point and each one grasped a sapling which he  held over his upturned mouth, as if about to swallow it. One of the  young men addressed him, saying \"Do thus. There are eight of us here;  but when you do this in the dance that you will teach your people you  need not have eight young men--six will be enough.\"    49. From here they went to TcÃ©tcel-hyitsÃ² (Big Oaks), to visit the home  of [Â¢]igin-yosÃ­ni (yosÃ­ni is a species of squirrel). It was built of  black water-slime (Ã§raÃ§lÃ­Ã§) and the door was of red sunbeams. On the  east wall hung a big black log; on the south wall, a blue log; on the  west wall, a yellow log; and on the north wall, a white log; in which  logs the squirrels dwelt. Although they were squirrels, they were young  men and young women, and looked very much like one another. All had red  and black stripes on their backs. These taught him how to make and bury  the kethÃ wns sacred to themselves.    50. DsilninÃ¨la` (Last Mountain) is a conical, sharp pointed eminence,  shaped like a Navajo hogan or lodge. It is black and has white streaks  running down its sides. This was the next place they visited. Within the  mountain was a house, whose door was of darkness and was guarded by  TcÃ¡pani (the Bat) and an animal called ÃantsÃ² (of crepuscular or  nocturnal habits). Here dwelt many young men and young women who were  skunks (golÃ­ji), and they taught the Navajo wanderer how to make and how  to bury the kethÃ wns which are sacred to the skunk.    51. The next place to which they went was Dsil-nikÃ­Â¢i-Ã gi (Mountain  Comes Down Steep), and here they found the place where Glo`dsilkÃ Ã¯  (Abert's squirrel, _Sciurus aberti_) and Glo`dsiljÃ­ni dwelt. When the  four entered, the squirrels said to them: \"What do you want here? You  are always visiting where you are not welcome.\" The gods replied: \"Be  not angry with us. This is a Navajo who was a captive among the Ute, but  he has escaped and has suffered much. I`Â¢nÃ¬` (the Lightning) has bidden  us to take him to the homes of all the Â¢igÃ¬ni (holy ones, supernatural  beings); therefore we have brought him here.\" \"It is well,\" said the  squirrels; \"but he is hungry and must have some food.\" They brought him  piÃ±on nuts, pine nuts, spruce nuts, and service berries; but the gods  told him not to partake of the nuts or he"]]]
