This is the reason why in fording the northern rivers, no fishes  are seen, as in England, wandering in the water.    Of the hills many may be called with Homer's Ida 'abundant in springs',  but few can deserve the epithet which he bestows upon Pelion by 'waving  their leaves.'  They exhibit very little variety; being almost wholly  covered with dark heath, and even that seems to be checked in its growth.  What is not heath is nakedness, a little diversified by now and then a  stream rushing down the steep.  An eye accustomed to flowery pastures and  waving harvests is astonished and repelled by this wide extent of  hopeless sterility.  The appearance is that of matter incapable of form  or usefulness, dismissed by nature from her care and disinherited of her  favours, left in its original elemental state, or quickened only with one  sullen power of useless vegetation.    It will very readily occur, that this uniformity of barrenness can afford  very little amusement to the traveller; that it is easy to sit at home  and conceive rocks and heath, and waterfalls; and that these journeys are  useless labours, which neither impregnate the imagination, nor enlarge  the understanding.  It is true that of far the greater part of things, we  must content ourselves with such knowledge as description may exhibit, or  analogy supply; but it is true likewise, that these ideas are always  incomplete, and that at least, till we have compared them with realities,  we do not know them to be just.  As we see more, we become possessed of  more certainties, and consequently gain more principles of reasoning, and  found a wider basis of analogy.    Regions mountainous and wild, thinly inhabited, and little cultivated,  make a great part of the earth, and he that has never seen them, must  live unacquainted with much of the face of nature, and with one of the  great scenes of human existence.    As the day advanced towards noon, we entered a narrow valley not very  flowery, but sufficiently verdant.  Our guides told us, that the horses  could not travel all day without rest or meat, and intreated us to stop  here, because no grass would be found in any other place.  The request  was reasonable and the argument cogent.  We therefore willingly  dismounted and diverted ourselves as the place gave us opportunity.    I sat down on a bank, such as a writer of Romance might have delighted to  feign.  I had indeed no trees to whisper over my head, but a clear  rivulet streamed at my feet.  The day was calm, the air soft, and all was  rudeness, silence, and solitude.  Before me, and on either side, were  high hills, which by hindering the eye from ranging, forced the mind to  find entertainment for itself.  Whether I spent the hour well I know not;  for here I first conceived the thought of this narration.    We were in this place at ease and by choice, and had no evils to suffer  or to fear; yet the imaginations excited by the view of an unknown and  untravelled wilderness are not such as arise in the artificial solitude  of parks and gardens, a flattering notion of self-sufficiency, a placid  indulgence of voluntary delusions, a secure expansion of the fancy, or a  cool concentration of the mental powers.  The phantoms which haunt a  desert are want, and misery, and danger; the evils of dereliction rush  upon the thoughts; man is made unwillingly acquainted with his own  weakness, and meditation shows him only how little he can sustain, and  how little he can perform.  There were no traces of inhabitants, except  perhaps a rude pile of clods called a summer hut, in which a herdsman had  rested in the favourable seasons.  Whoever had been in the place where I  then sat, unprovided with provisions and ignorant of the country, might,  at least before the roads were made, have wandered among the rocks, till  he had perished with hardship, before he could have found either food or  shelter.  Yet what are these hillocks to the ridges of Taurus, or these  spots of wildness to the desarts of America?    It was not long before we were invited to mount, and continued our  journey along the side of a lough, kept full by many streams, which with  more or less rapidity and noise, crossed the road from the hills on the  other hand.  These currents, in their diminished state, after several dry  months, afford, to one who has always lived in level countries, an  unusual and delightful spectacle; but in the rainy season, such as every  winter may be expected to bring, must precipitate an impetuous and  tremendous flood.  I suppose the way by which we went, is at that time  impassable.          GLENSHEALS      The lough at last ended in a river broad and shallow like the rest, but  that it may be passed when it is deeper, there is a bridge over it.  Beyond it is a valley called Glensheals, inhabited by the clan of Macrae.  Here we found a village called Auknasheals, consisting of many huts,  perhaps twenty, built all of dry-stone, that is, stones piled up without  mortar.    We had, by the direction of the officers at Fort Augustus, taken bread  for ourselves, and tobacco for those Highlanders who might show us any  kindness.  We were now at a place where we could obtain milk, but we must  have wanted bread if we had not brought it.  The people of this valley  did not appear to know any English, and our guides now became doubly  necessary as interpreters.  A woman, whose hut was distinguished by  greater spaciousness and better architecture, brought out some pails of  milk.  The villagers gathered about us in considerable numbers, I believe  without any evil intention, but with a very savage wildness of aspect and  manner.  When our meal was over, Mr. Boswell sliced the bread, and  divided it amongst them, as he supposed them never to have tasted a  wheaten loaf before.  He then gave them little pieces of twisted tobacco,  and among the children we distributed a small handful of halfpence, which  they received with great eagerness.  Yet I have been since told, that the  people of that valley are not indigent; and when we mentioned them  afterwards as needy and pitiable, a Highland lady let us know, that we  might spare our commiseration; for the dame whose milk we drank had  probably more than a dozen milk-cows.  She seemed unwilling to take any  price, but being pressed to make a demand, at last named a shilling.  Honesty is not greater where elegance is less.  One of the bystanders, as  we were told afterwards, advised her to ask for more, but she said a  shilling was enough.  We gave her half a crown, and I hope got some  credit for our behaviour; for the company said, if our interpreters did  not flatter us, that they had not seen such a day since the old laird of  Macleod passed through their country.    The Macraes, as we heard afterwards in the Hebrides, were originally an  indigent and subordinate clan, and having no farms nor stock, were in  great numbers servants to the Maclellans, who, in the war of Charles the  First, took arms at the call of the heroic Montrose, and were, in one of  his battles, almost all destroyed.  The women that were left at home,  being thus deprived of their husbands, like the Scythian ladies of old,  married their servants, and the Macraes became a considerable race.          THE HIGHLANDS      As we continued our journey, we were at leisure to extend our  speculations, and to investigate the reason of those peculiarities by  which such rugged regions as these before us are generally distinguished.    Mountainous countries commonly contain the original, at least the oldest  race of inhabitants, for they are not easily conquered, because they must  be entered by narrow ways, exposed to every power of mischief from those  that occupy the heights; and every new ridge is a new fortress, where the  defendants have again the same advantages.  If the assailants either  force the strait, or storm the summit, they gain only so much ground;  their enemies are fled to take possession of the next rock, and the  pursuers stand at gaze, knowing neither where the ways of escape wind  among the steeps, nor where the bog has firmness to sustain them: besides  that, mountaineers have an agility in climbing and descending distinct  from strength or courage, and attainable only by use.    If the war be not soon concluded, the invaders are dislodged by hunger;  for in those anxious and toilsome marches, provisions cannot easily be  carried, and are never to be found.  The wealth of mountains is cattle,  which, while the men stand in the passes, the women drive away.  Such  lands at last cannot repay the expence of conquest, and therefore perhaps  have not been so often invaded by the mere ambition of dominion; as by  resentment of robberies and insults, or the desire of enjoying in  security the more fruitful provinces.    As mountains are long before they are conquered, they are likewise long  before they are civilized.  Men are softened by intercourse mutually  profitable, and instructed by comparing their own notions with those of  others.  Thus Caesar found the maritime parts of Britain made less  barbarous by their commerce with the Gauls.  Into a barren and rough  tract no stranger is brought either by the hope of gain or of pleasure.  The inhabitants having neither commodities for sale, nor money for  purchase, seldom visit more polished places, or if they do visit them,  seldom return.    It sometimes happens that by conquest, intermixture, or gradual  refinement, the cultivated parts of a country change their language.  The  mountaineers then become a distinct nation, cut off by dissimilitude of  speech from conversation with their neighbours.  Thus in Biscay, the  original Cantabrian, and in Dalecarlia, the old Swedish still subsists.  Thus Wales and the Highlands speak the tongue of the first inhabitants of  Britain, while the other parts have received first the Saxon, and in some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20656"],[0,"Old Christmas: from the Sketch Book of Washington Irving (#8)"],[1,"lasses in the neighbourhood; though these last, he affirms, are the most  difficult to keep in tune; your pretty female singer being exceedingly  wayward and capricious, and very liable to accident.\"    [Illustration]    As the morning, though frosty, was remarkably fine and clear, the most  of the family walked to the church, which was a very old building of  gray stone, and stood near a village, about half-a-mile from the park  gate. Adjoining it was a low snug parsonage, which seemed coeval with  the church. The front of it was perfectly matted with a yew-tree that  had been trained against its walls, through the dense foliage of which  apertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique  lattices. As we passed this sheltered nest, the parson issued forth and  preceded us.    I had expected to see a sleek well-conditioned pastor, such as is often  found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron's table; but I  was disappointed. The parson was a little, meagre, black-looking man,  with a grizzled wig that was too wide, and stood off from each ear; so  that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it, like a dried filbert  in its shell. He wore a rusty coat, with great skirts, and pockets that  would have held the church Bible and prayer-book; and his small legs  seemed still smaller, from being planted in large shoes, decorated with  enormous buckles.    [Illustration]    I was informed by Frank Bracebridge that the parson had been a chum of  his father's at Oxford, and had received this living shortly after the  latter had come to his estate. He was a complete black-letter hunter,  and would scarcely read a work printed in the Roman character. The  editions of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde were his delight; and he was  indefatigable in his researches after such old English writers as have  fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness. In deference, perhaps, to  the notions of Mr. Bracebridge, he had made diligent investigations into  the festive rights and holiday customs of former times; and had been as  zealous in the inquiry, as if he had been a boon companion; but it was  merely with that plodding spirit with which men of adust temperament  follow up any track of study, merely because it is denominated learning;  indifferent to its intrinsic nature, whether it be the illustration of  the wisdom, or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity. He had poured  over these old volumes so intensely, that they seemed to have been  reflected into his countenance indeed; which, if the face be an index  of the mind, might be compared to a title-page of black-letter.    [Illustration: \"On reaching the church-porch, we found the parson  rebuking the gray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe.\"--PAGE 95.]    On reaching the church-porch, we found the parson rebuking the  gray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which  the church was decorated. It was, he observed, an unholy plant, profaned  by having been used by the Druids in their mystic ceremonies; and though  it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of halls and  kitchens, yet it had been deemed by the Fathers of the Church as  unhallowed, and totally unfit for sacred purposes. So tenacious was he  on this point, that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great  part of the humble trophies of his taste, before the parson would  consent to enter upon the service of the day.    The interior of the church was venerable but simple; on the walls were  several mural monuments of the Bracebridges, and just beside the altar  was a tomb of ancient workmanship, on which lay the effigy of a warrior  in armour, with his legs crossed, a sign of his having been a crusader.  I was told it was one of the family who had signalised himself in the  Holy Land, and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the  hall.    [Illustration]    During service, Master Simon stood up in the pew, and repeated the  responses very audibly; evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion  punctually observed by a gentleman of the old school, and a man of old  family connections. I observed, too, that he turned over the leaves of a  folio prayer-book with something of a flourish; possibly to show off an  enormous seal-ring which enriched one of his fingers, and which had  the look of a family relic. But he was evidently most solicitous about  the musical part of the service, keeping his eye fixed intently on the  choir, and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis.    [Illustration: \"The orchestra was in a small gallery, and presented a  most whimsical grouping of heads.\"--PAGE 97.]    [Illustration]    The orchestra was in a small gallery, and presented a most whimsical  grouping of heads, piled one above the other, among which I  particularly noticed that of the village tailor, a pale fellow with a  retreating forehead and chin, who played on the clarionet, and seemed to  have blown his face to a point; and there was another, a short pursy  man, stooping and labouring at a bass viol, so as to show nothing but  the top of a round bald head, like the egg of an ostrich. There were two  or three pretty faces among the female singers, to which the keen air  of a frosty morning had given a bright rosy tint; but the gentlemen  choristers had evidently been chosen, like old Cremona fiddles, more for  tone than looks; and as several had to sing from the same book, there  were clusterings of odd physiognomies, not unlike those groups of  cherubs we sometimes see on country tombstones.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well, the vocal  parts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental, and some  loitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling  over a passage with prodigious celerity, and clearing more bars than the  keenest fox-hunter, to be in at the death. But the great trial was an  anthem that had been prepared and arranged by Master Simon, and on which  he had founded great expectation. Unluckily there was a blunder at the  very outset; the musicians became flurried; Master Simon was in a fever,  everything went on lamely and irregularly until they came to a chorus  beginning \"Now let us sing with one accord,\" which seemed to be a signal  for parting company: all became discord and confusion; each shifted for  himself, and got to the end as well, or rather as soon, as he could,  excepting one old chorister in a pair of horn spectacles bestriding and  pinching a long sonorous nose; who, happening to stand a little apart,  and being wrapped up in his own melody, kept on a quavering course,  wriggling his head, ogling his book, and winding all up by a nasal solo  of at least three bars' duration.    [Illustration]    The parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies of  Christmas, and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day of  thanksgiving, but of rejoicing; supporting the correctness of his  opinions by the earliest usages of the Church, and enforcing them by the  authorities of Theophilus of Cesarea, St. Cyprian, St. Chrysostom, St.  Augustine, and a cloud more of Saints and Fathers, from whom he made  copious quotations. I was a little at a loss to perceive the necessity  of such a mighty array of forces to maintain a point which no one  present seemed inclined to dispute; but I soon found that the good man  had a legion of ideal adversaries to contend with; having in the course  of his researches on the subject of Christmas, got completely embroiled  in the sectarian controversies of the Revolution, when the Puritans made  such a fierce assault upon the ceremonies of the Church, and poor old  Christmas was driven out of the land by proclamation of parliament.[E]  The worthy parson lived but with times past, and knew but a little of  the present.    Shut up among worm-eaten tomes in the retirement of his antiquated  little study, the pages of old times were to him as the gazettes of the  day; while the era of the Revolution was mere modern history. He forgot  that nearly two centuries had elapsed since the fiery persecution of  poor mince-pie throughout the land; when plum-porridge was denounced as  \"mere popery,\" and roast beef as antichristian; and that Christmas had  been brought in again triumphantly with the merry court of King Charles  at the Restoration. He kindled into warmth with the ardour of his  contest, and the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to combat; had  a stubborn conflict with old Prynne and two or three other forgotten  champions of the Roundheads, on the subject of Christmas festivity; and  concluded by urging his hearers, in the most solemn and affecting  manner, to stand to the traditionary customs of their fathers, and feast  and make merry on this joyful anniversary of the Church.    [Illustration]    I have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate  effects; for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and all  possessed with the gaiety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their  pastor. The elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard, greeting  and shaking hands; and the children ran about crying, Ule! Ule! and  repeating some uncouth rhymes,[F] which the parson, who had joined us,  informed me had been handed down from days of yore. The villagers doffed  their hats to the Squire as he passed, giving him the good wishes of the  season with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity, and were invited by  him to the hall, to take something to keep out the cold of the weather;  and I heard blessings uttered by several of the poor, which convinced me  that, in the midst of his enjoyments, the worthy old cavalier had not  forgotten the true Christmas virtue of charity.    [Illustration]    On our way homeward his heart seemed overflowing with generous and happy  feelings. As we passed over a rising ground which commanded something of  a"]]]
