Here,  as elsewhere, the old work, as far as it remained, has been left  undisturbed, and simply incorporated into the new, the architect  contenting himself with removing the modern walls which had been set up  at the extremities to keep out the weather, providing abutments to  strengthen the central arches, and supplying what was wanted to complete  the first design within the more limited area. During the reconstruction  of this transept the fine arcaded #Stone Screen# was revealed which  separates it from the space within the tower. The screen was buried some  four feet in earth, and the upper part entirely concealed by the smithy.  The style shows it to be of the fifteenth century, when there was  probably a similar screen on the opposite side of the choir, the two  backing the stalls, which are known to have been carried under the  tower. The existing screen is divided into two wide arches, slightly  depressed, with a moulding in four orders. It has been refaced on the  choir side, and a partition of ironwork, ornamented with coloured coats  of arms, inserted in the open spaces, to serve as a barrier without  obstructing the view in either direction.    Under one of the arches there is a stone coffin, with a much decayed  cover of Purbeck marble, which is supposed to have contained the body of  a Prior. It was opened for examination during the rebuilding, when a  skeleton was found within it, with sandals still on the feet, but as the  skull was gone it was evident that the coffin had previously been  opened. In the arch by its side there was another coffin of the same  character, which has unfortunately been shifted to the north ambulatory.  It is without a cover, and the skeleton is no longer there; but the  leaden envelope remains, more or less in the state in which it was  folded round the corpse. The arched recess on the east, by the side of  the opening to the ambulatory, is supposed to have been the entrance to  the Walden Chantry; but it has been built up with a return-wall.    The triforium is continuous through all three walls of the transept,  each bay consisting of a double pointed arch, except that above the  ambulatory, where the surviving Norman fragment shows three round-headed  openings, included in a semicircular arch with billet moulding. The  clerestory in the north wall, where the work is entirely new, is  ornamented with a traceried arcading on an interior plane, which has a  very beautiful effect.    #The South Transept#, opened after restoration on 14th March, 1891, had  been turned to account as a burial-ground, supplementary to that at the  west end. The side walls were allowed to stand for the enclosure, but  the south wall was pulled down, and another erected within the space, to  separate the \"Green Churchyard,\" as it was called, from the church. In  this case, therefore, the restoration meant little more than the removal  of the intercepting wall to open out the transept, and building a new  one at the extremity, with a partial reconstruction of those which were  decayed to connect them with it. In the renovation of both transepts  blue Bath stone has been used internally, and Portland stone with flints  for the exterior. The conservative nature of the work is here seen in  the side walls, each of which retains a bay of the old Norman triforium,  with its round-headed divisions, to which a new bay has been added, with  a slightly pointed arcade, as a connection, without any violent  contrast, between the older parts of the transept and the new south  wall. This presents an agreeable variety to that facing it in the  opposite transept. In the upper stage, instead of a triforium and  clerestory, there are three tall windows of two lights each, the central  being carried above the others, and distinguished by a more ornate  tracery, here taking a cruciform pattern above the trefoil-headed  divisions, instead of a foliated circle as in the side windows. The  arcading in which they are all placed is severely simple in character,  the slightly pointed headings resting on plain shafts, with moulded  bases and capitals--the whole composition a pleasing relief to the  heavier architecture on each side without being discordant. The same may  be said of the lower stage, also arcaded in three divisions,  corresponding with those above, but rather more massive in character.  The central arch forms a porch, giving access to the church on that  side, with a recess to the east and west of it, each lighted by a  dwarfed window. The eastern of these recesses answers the purpose of a  baptistery. #The Font# dates from the early fifteenth century, and is  octagonal in shape, with a tall cover, crocketed at the angles,  suspended on a swivel above it. The facets of the octagon are perfectly  plain, but there is an oblong incision in one of them which looks very  much like the matrix of a brass, or the seat of a sculptured panel,  which has been removed. There is a traditional interest attaching to the  font as that in which William Hogarth, the famous painter and satirist,  was baptized. He was born in Bartholomew Close on 10th November, 1697,  and his baptism is entered in the parish register on the 28th of the  same month.[2] It is recorded that the font had a narrow escape in the  eighteenth century, when the Vestry ordered it to be removed for a new  one, but fortunately the order was never carried out.    In a recess on the eastern side of the transept there is a monument to  #Elizabeth Freshwater#, whose effigy, in the costume and ruff collar of  her time, is shown kneeling at a small _priedieu_, with English and  Latin inscriptions beneath:        Here lyeth interred the body of Elizabeth Freshwater, late wife      of Thomas Freshwater, of Henbridge, in the County of Essex,      Esquire; eldest daughter of John Orme of this parish, Gentleman,      and Mary his wife. She died the 16th day of May Anno Domini      1617, being of the age of 26 years.            Mors properius, quali tinxisti tela veneno          Ut sic trina uno vulnere praeda cadat?          Unam saeva feris; sed et uno hoc occidit ictu          Uxor dulcis, amans filia, chara soror.          (=O hasty death, how hast them so contrived          Thy darts with venomous poison to direct          That, by one cruel stroke, not one but three are killed,          Sweet wife, a loving daughter, sister dear!)    The doorway beneath the monument opens on the staircase to the south  triforium.    #The Choir#, now restored as nearly as possible to its original state,  consists of five bays on each side, with an apsidal termination of five  arches, distinguished from the others (mainly semicircular) by their  \"stilted\" form and much narrower span, which, in fact, measures no more  than the diameter of the intervening columns, and gives an appearance of  extra massiveness to the east end of the church. All the arches display  some approximation to the \"horseshoe,\" in a slight inward inclination on  either side towards the capitals on which they rest; but the shape is  very definitely assumed in each of those immediately contiguous to the  transverse curve. These are of the genuine \"horseshoe\" pattern  characteristic of Arabian or Moorish buildings; and their exact  similarity in detail, with their position facing one another at each  extremity of the apse, would seem to indicate a structural necessity, or  deliberate intention in the design, which, neither here nor elsewhere in  the arcading, is to be attributed to any subsidence, or imperfect  workmanship, sometimes held to account for the deflection as a mere  accident.    [Illustration: THE FONT AND THE FRESHWATER MONUMENT                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    [Illustration: INTERIOR FROM THE EAST, SHOWING PRIOR BOLTON'S GALLERY                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    The character of these arches, with the slightly domical vaults  noticeable in the adjacent aisles, has led some persons to detect an  Oriental influence in the building--possibly traceable to the visitors  from Byzantium whom the founder is said to have consulted while it was  in course of erection--though it is argued to the contrary that these  features are sufficiently accounted for by the general tendency of  Anglo-Norman architecture at the time, as illustrated elsewhere.    The arcading throughout rests on massive piers and circular columns,  with square bases and abaci (incised at the angles) and low cushioned  capitals, ornamented with a simple scallop. Above the arches, on the  choir side, there is a billet moulding, which is considered unique in  that, instead of forming a separate decoration to each arch, it is  carried along horizontally above the abaci on either side in a  continuous line of ornament.    #The Triforium# consists of a series of rounded arches, the piers from  which they spring being placed directly above those of the main arcade.  Each of the side bays is divided into four compartments by small  columns, above which the tympanum of the enclosing arch is occupied by a  blank wall. The sequence is, of course, interrupted by the oriel window  in the central bay on the south; and the narrower openings in the apse  only admit of a twofold division. There are said to have been originally  windows at the back of the triforium-gallery, as at Durham,  Peterborough, and other Norman churches of the same period; but the  mutilation and rebuilding in the external walls have greatly destroyed  the original work.    #Prior Bolton's Window# was probably inserted about 1530, when the device  of a \"bolt in tun\" was officially authorized for Bolton's arms, on his  own choice, as presenting his name in the emblematical form then in  vogue. The window is an \"oriel\" in the Perpendicular style, separated  vertically by mullions into three lights in front, with one at each end  of the projection, and horizontally by transoms into an upper and lower  tier, the former"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21528"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine, Volume 1,  No. 1, August 1850 (#8)"],[1,"fleecy cloud-rack sails    'Fore the warm-breath'd summer gales,    Shedding blessings on the earth,    But heavenward points its primal birth.      \"Hark! the green-sedg'd chiming rill,    Weeding down yon cot-crown'd hill,    The torrent's dash, the river's gush,    The mighty wind-resounding crush    Of the fallen monarch of the wood,    Re-echo'd by the distant flood.    \"However, this masque is readable enough, though Flora and Zephyrus,  Oberon and Titania, not much wanted anywhere in the nineteenth century,  seem oddly out of place amid 'whippoor-wills,' and 'mockbirds,' and  other Yankee nationalities, pleasing and natural as they are in  themselves.

Lord Brougham observed, that no one who had  lived so long as he had in Parliament had ever taken notice so seldom of  any libellous matter published, or of any breach of privilege committed  against him. He might also add, that no person had ever been more the  object of the most indiscriminate, and he might say the most absurd and  the most unfounded abuse. Nevertheless, in all such cases he had adopted  a neutral course, and had left the truth to come out in the natural  lapse of events. There was, however, one species of breach of privilege  which he had never been disposed to pass unnoticed. Attacks one must  undergo. To be exposed to attacks was the fate of all men who lived in  public. No man ought to shrink from or be too sensitive to attacks; but,  under pretence of stating what a lord had said in Parliament, to put  words into his mouth which he had never uttered, for the purpose, the  express purpose, of calumniating him,--words which the writer of the  calumny must have well known that he had never uttered, to put such  words into his mouth for such a purpose, formed a case in which he  thought that the party calumniated was bound to bring the party so  offending under the notice of their lordships. Lord Brougham proceeded  to arraign the _Daily News_ for an example of this crime which would  have done no dishonor to the inventive faculties of the _Literary  World_.           *       *       *       *       *    A MOCK GUILLOTINE.--DELIRIUM TREMENS ON THE STAGE.--It is stated in  _Galignani's Messenger_ that at the end of the late carnival two married  women of Vidauban Department of the Var manufactured a lay figure,  entirely in white, and, after attaching a chain round its neck, placed  it in a small cart. Many of the inhabitants then paraded it through the  village in solemn procession, accompanied by a crowd of men carrying  axes, &c., and singing revolutionary songs. After a while they formed a  sort of revolutionary tribunal, and the figure, which was called  \"Blanc,\" was gravely tried, and, by the majority of the votes of the  crowd, condemned to death, the principal judge, a man named Arnaud,  saying, \"Blanc! you prevent us from dancing farandoles, and therefore we  condemn you to death!\" Thereupon, a man seized the figure, placed it on  a plank, and at one blow with his axe severed the head from the body. A  bottle of wine had been placed in the neck of the figure, and, this  having been broken by the blow, a resemblance of blood was produced. The  head was then cast into the crowd and torn to pieces by them. This  scandalous scene created a most painful impression throughout the  department. A few days afterward, four men who played a principal part  in the affair, and the two women who made the figure, were brought to  trial on the charge of exciting citizens to hatred of each other. The  men pleaded drunkenness as an excuse--the women declared that they had  only intended to amuse their children. Four of the accused were  acquitted, and the other two, who had acted as judge and executioner,  were condemned to four and three months' imprisonment. It is a pity that  by the application of some such law, the disgustingly vulgar and  brutalizing piece called _The Drunkard_, which has lately been played  with \"immense success\" at Barnum's Theatre, (and in which the chief  characters appear in all the stages of degradation until one of them is  nearly dead with the delirium tremens), cannot be suppressed. With all  its pretensions to morality, the play is irredeemably bad and base.           *       *       *       *       *    The CINCINNATI ART UNION advertises Powers's Greek Slave as one of its  prizes, and publishes an engraving of it which should frighten away all  subscriptions.           *       *       *       *       *    AMERICAN EXTENSION AND CONQUEST.--The Daily News thus opens an article  upon the recent attempt to invade Cuba:    \"Shortly after the American war; a sapient French statesman, writing  from Louisiana to his royal master in Paris, advised the French  government to cultivate a close and intimate alliance with the Cherokee  Indians, who, occupying as they did the defiles of the Alleghanies,  would form a permanent bulwark between the young Anglo-Saxon republic  and the French possessions on the Mississippi. But the permanent bulwark  could no more resist the advancing wave than a lath and plaster  breakwater could withstand the seas of the Channel. In a few short years  not a vestige of it was to be found, and in less than a quarter of a  century both French and Cherokees had disappeared from the scene. Not  only were the defiles of the Alleghanies opened, but the Alleghanies  themselves have since been virtually removed. Ever since the foundation  of the republic, our American kinsmen have been anxious to emulate and  surpass us in indulging that desire for territorial acquisition, which  seems to be, for the present at least, the ruling passion of the  Anglo-Saxon mind. Confined at first between the Alleghanies and the  Atlantic, they gradually spread westward to the Mississippi, of both  banks of which, from its sources to its _embouchure_, they possessed  themselves as early as 1806. Their coast line, which, originally, did  not extend beyond the St. Mary, was soon afterward carried round the  peninsula of Florida, and along the northern shore of the Mexican Gulf,  westward to the mouth of the Sabine. Not satisfied with this, they  planted themselves in Texas, and some years afterward transferred their  boundary to the Rio Grande. Oregon, New Mexico, and California, fell in  quick succession within the grasp of the confederacy. The entire  disappearance of the Spaniard from the continent is a consummation, not  even doubtful, but simply awaiting the convenience of the encroaching  Anglo-Saxon. For the accession of Canada, time is implicitly relied  upon--the idea of conquest in that quarter being out of the  question--and thus it is that even sober-minded men are beginning to  believe that the time is not far off when the glowing prophecies of the  most sanguine will be realized, that the boundaries of the republic  would yet be the Isthmus, the North Pole, and the two oceans.\"           *       *       *       *       *    LEDRU ROLLIN'S new work, \"The Decline of England,\" of which the first  volume only has appeared, is, as might have been anticipated, savagely  attacked in most of the British journals.
