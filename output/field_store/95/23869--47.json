All this was done without the aid or presence of Bernardin  de Saint-Pierre, the Intendant. The Minister of the Interior, meanwhile,  had communicated to him the decision of the National Convention, and  invited him to continue his duties up to the moment when the new  organization should be established. After remaining in his office until  July 9th, he retired from the Museum August 7th following, and finally  withdrew to the country at Essones.    The organization of the Museum is the same now as in 1793, having for  over a century been the chief biological centre of France, and with its  magnificent collections was never more useful in the advancement of  science than at this moment.    Let us now look at the composition of the assembly of professors, which  formed the Board of Administration of the Museum at the time of his  appointment.    The associates of Lamarck and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who had already been  connected with the Royal Garden and Cabinet, were Daubenton, Thouin,  Desfontaines, Portal, and Mertrude. The Nestor of the faculty was  Daubenton, who was born in 1716. He was the collaborator of Buffon in  the first part of his _Histoire Naturelle_, and the author of treatises  on the mammals and of papers on the bats and other mammals, also on  reptiles, together with embryological and anatomical essays. Thouin, the  professor of horticulture, was the veteran gardener and architect of the  Jardin des Plantes, and withal a most useful man. He was affable,  modest, genial, greatly beloved by his students, a man of high  character, and possessing much executive ability. A street near the  Jardin was named after him. He was succeeded by Bosc. Desfontaines  had the chair of botany, but his attainments as a botanist were  mediocre, and his lectures were said to have been tame and  uninteresting. Portal taught human anatomy, while Mertrude lectured on  vertebrate anatomy; his chair was filled by Cuvier in 1795.    Of this group Lamarck was _facile princeps_, as he combined great  sagacity and experience as a systematist with rare intellectual and  philosophic traits. For this reason his fame has perhaps outlasted that  of his young contemporary, Geoffroy St. Hilaire.    The necessities of the Museum led to the division of the chair of  zooelogy, botany being taught by Desfontaines. And now began a new  era in the life of Lamarck. After twenty-five years spent in botanical  research he was compelled, as there seemed nothing else for him to  undertake, to assume charge of the collection of invertebrate animals,  and to him was assigned that enormous, chaotic mass of forms then known  as molluscs, insects, worms, and microscopic animals. Had he continued  to teach botany, we might never have had the Lamarck of biology and  biological philosophy. But turned adrift in a world almost unexplored,  he faced the task with his old-time bravery and dogged persistence, and  at once showed the skill of a master mind in systematic work.    The two new professorships in zooelogy were filled, one by Lamarck,  previously known as a botanist, and the other by the young Etienne  Geoffroy St. Hilaire, then twenty-two years old, who was at that time a  student of Hauey, and in charge of the minerals, besides teaching  mineralogy with especial reference to crystallography.    To Geoffroy was assigned the four classes of vertebrates, but in reality  he only occupied himself with the mammals and birds. Afterwards  Lacepede[33] took charge of the reptiles and fishes. On the other hand,  Lamarck's field comprised more than nine-tenths of the animal kingdom.  Already the collections of insects, crustacea, worms, molluscs,  echinoderms, corals, etc., at the Museum were enormous. At this time  France began to send out those exploring expeditions to all parts of the  globe which were so numerous and fruitful during the first third of the  nineteenth century. The task of arranging and classifying single-handed  this enormous mass of material was enough to make a young man quail, and  it is a proof of the vigor, innate ability, and breadth of view of the  man that in this pioneer work he not only reduced to some order this  vast horde of forms, but showed such insight and brought about such  radical reforms in zooelogical classification, especially in the  foundation and limitation of certain classes, an insight no one before  him had evinced. To him and to Latreille much of the value of the _Regne  Animal_ of Cuvier, as regards invertebrate classes, is due.    The exact title of the chair held by Lamarck is given in the _Etat_ of  persons attached to the National Museum of Natural History at the date  of the 1er messidor, an II. of the Republic (1794), where he is  mentioned as follows: \"LAMARCK--fifty years old; married for the second  time; wife _enceinte_; six children; professor of zooelogy, of insects,  of worms, and microscopic animals.\" His salary, like that of the other  professors, was put at 2,868 livres, 6 sous, 8 deniers.[34]    Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire[35] has related how the professorship was  given to Lamarck.      \"The law of 1793 had prescribed that all parts of the natural    sciences should be equally taught. The insects, shells, and an    infinity of organisms--a portion of creation still almost    unknown--remained to be treated in such a course. A desire to comply    with the wishes of his colleagues, members of the administration,    and without doubt, also, the consciousness of his powers as an    investigator, determined M. de Lamarck: this task, so great, and    which would tend to lead him into numberless researches; this    friendless, unthankful task he accepted--courageous resolution,    which has resulted in giving us immense undertakings and great and    important works, among which posterity will distinguish and honor    forever the work which, entirely finished and collected into seven    volumes, is known under the name of _Animaux sans Vertebres_.\"    Before his appointment to this chair Lamarck had devoted considerable  attention to the study of conchology, and already possessed a rather  large collection of shells. His last botanical paper appeared in 1800,  but practically his botanical studies were over by 1793.    During the early years of the Revolution, namely, from 1789 to and  including 1791, Lamarck published nothing. Whether this was naturally  due to the social convulsions and turmoil which raged around the Jardin  des Plantes, or to other causes, is not known. In 1792, however, Lamarck  and his friends and colleagues, Bruguiere, Olivier, and the Abbe Hauey,  founded the _Journal d'Histoire Naturelle_, which contains nineteen  botanical articles, two on shells, besides one on physics, by Lamarck.  These, with many articles by other men of science, illustrated by  plates, indicate that during the years of social unrest and upheaval in  Paris, and though France was also engaged in foreign wars, the  philosophers preserved in some degree, at least, the traditional calm of  their profession, and passed their days and nights in absorption in  matters biological and physical. In 1801 appeared his _Systeme des  Animaux sans Vertebres_, preceded by the opening discourse of his  lectures on the lower animals, in which his views on the origin of  species were first propounded. During the years 1793-1798, or for a  period of six years, he published nothing on zooelogy, and during this  time only one paper appeared, in 1798, on the influence of the moon on  the earth's atmosphere. But as his memoirs on fire and on sound were  published in 1798, it is evident that his leisure hours during this  period, when not engaged in museum work and the preparation of his  lectures, were devoted to meditations on physical and meteorological  subjects, and most probably it was towards the end of this period that  he brooded over and conceived his views on organic evolution.    It appears that he was led, in the first place, to conchological studies  through his warm friendship for a fellow naturalist, and this is one of  many proofs of his affectionate, generous nature. The touching story is  told by Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire.[36]      \"It was impossible to assign him a professorship of botany. M. de    Lamarck, then forty-nine years old, accepted this change in his    scientific studies to take charge of that which everybody had    neglected; because it was, indeed, a heavy load, this branch of    natural history, where, with so varied relations, everything was to    be created. On one group he was a little prepared, but it was by    accident; a self-sacrifice to friendship was the cause. For it was    both to please his friend Bruguiere as well as to penetrate more    deeply into the affections of this very reserved naturalist, and    also to converse with him in the only language which he wished to    hear, which was restricted to conversations on shells, that M. de    Lamarck had made some conchological studies. Oh, how, in 1793, did    he regret that his friend had gone to Persia! He had wished, he had    planned, that he should take the professorship which it was proposed    to create. He would at least supply his place; it was in answer to    the yearnings of his soul, and this affectionate impulse became a    fundamental element in the nature of one of the greatest of    zooelogical geniuses of our epoch.\"    Once settled in his new line of work, Lamarck, the incipient zooelogist,  at a period in life when many students of less flexible and energetic  natures become either hide-bound and conservative, averse to taking up a  different course of study, or actually cease all work and rust  out--after a half century of his life had passed, this rare spirit,  burning with enthusiasm, charged like some old-time knight or explorer  into a new realm and into \"fresh fields and pastures new.\" His spirit,  still young and fresh after nearly thirty years of mental"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#8)"],[1,"Rude.    The plainsman lay in strained posture, his ear against the ground.    \"Hide the wagon and horses in the clump of cottonwoods,\" he ordered,  tersely. Springing to his feet, he ran to the top of the knoll above  the hollow, where he again placed his ear to the ground.    Jones's practiced ear had detected the quavering rumble of far-away,  thundering hoofs. He searched the wide waste of plain with his powerful  glass. To the southwest, miles distant, a cloud of dust mushroomed  skyward. \"Not buffalo,\" he muttered, \"maybe wild horses.\" He watched  and waited. The yellow cloud rolled forward, enlarging, spreading out,  and drove before it a darkly indistinct, moving mass. As soon as he had  one good look at this he ran back to his comrades.    \"Stampede! Wild horses! Indians! Look to your rifles and hide!\"    Wordless and pale, the men examined their Sharps, and made ready to  follow Jones. He slipped into the thorny brake and, flat on his  stomach, wormed his way like a snake far into the thickly interlaced  web of branches. Rude and Adams crawled after him. Words were  superfluous. Quiet, breathless, with beating hearts, the hunters  pressed close to the dry grass. A long, low, steady rumble filled the  air, and increased in volume till it became a roar. Moments, endless  moments, passed. The roar filled out like a flood slowly released from  its confines to sweep down with the sound of doom. The ground began to  tremble and quake: the light faded; the smell of dust pervaded the  thicket, then a continuous streaming roar, deafening as persistent roll  of thunder, pervaded the hiding place. The stampeding horses had split  round the hollow. The roar lessened. Swiftly as a departing snow-squall  rushing on through the pines, the thunderous thud and tramp of hoofs  died away.    The trained horses hidden in the cottonwoods never stirred. \"Lie low!  lie low!\" breathed the plainsman to his companions.    Throb of hoofs again became audible, not loud and madly pounding as  those that had passed, but low, muffled, rhythmic. Jones's sharp eye,  through a peephole in the thicket, saw a cream-colored mustang bob over  the knoll, carrying an Indian. Another and another, then a swiftly  following, close-packed throng appeared. Bright red feathers and white  gleamed; weapons glinted; gaunt, bronzed savage leaned forward on racy,  slender mustangs.    The plainsman shrank closer to the ground. \"Apache!\" he exclaimed to  himself, and gripped his rifle. The band galloped down to the hollow,  and slowing up, piled single file over the bank. The leader, a short,  squat chief, plunged into the brake not twenty yards from the hidden  men. Jones recognized the cream mustang; he knew the somber, sinister,  broad face. It belonged to the Red Chief of the Apaches.    \"Geronimo!\" murmured the plainsman through his teeth.    Well for the Apache that no falcon savage eye discovered aught strange  in the little hollow! One look at the sand of the stream bed would have  cost him his life. But the Indians crossed the thicket too far up; they  cantered up the slope and disappeared. The hoof-beats softened and  ceased.    \"Gone?\" whispered Rude.    \"Gone. But wait,\" whispered Jones. He knew the savage nature, and he  knew how to wait. After a long time, he cautiously crawled out of the  thicket and searched the surroundings with a plainsman's eye. He  climbed the slope and saw the clouds of dust, the near one small, the  far one large, which told him all he needed to know.    \"Comanches?\" queried Adams, with a quaver in his voice. He was new to  the plains.    \"Likely,\" said Jones, who thought it best not to tell all he knew. Then  he added to himself: \"We've no time to lose. There's water back here  somewhere. The Indians have spotted the buffalo, and were running the  horses away from the water.\"    The three got under way again, proceeding carefully, so as not to raise  the dust, and headed due southwest. Scantier and scantier grew the  grass; the hollows were washes of sand; steely gray dunes, like long,  flat, ocean swells, ribbed the prairie. The gray day declined. Late  into the purple night they traveled, then camped without fire.    In the gray morning Jones climbed a high ride and scanned the  southwest. Low dun-colored sandhills waved from him down and down, in  slow, deceptive descent. A solitary and remote waste reached out into  gray infinitude. A pale lake, gray as the rest of that gray expanse,  glimmered in the distance.    \"Mirage!\" he muttered, focusing his glass, which only magnified all  under the dead gray, steely sky. \"Water must be somewhere; but can that  be it? It's too pale and elusive to be real. No life--a blasted, staked  plain! Hello!\"    A thin, black, wavering line of wild fowl, moving in beautiful, rapid  flight, crossed the line of his vision. \"Geese flying north, and low.  There's water here,\" he said. He followed the flock with his glass, saw  them circle over the lake, and vanish in the gray sheen.    \"It's water.\" He hurried back to camp. His haggard and worn companions  scorned his discovery. Adams siding with Rude, who knew the plains,  said: \"Mirage! the lure of the desert!\" Yet dominated by a force too  powerful for them to resist, they followed the buffalo-hunter. All day  the gleaming lake beckoned them onward, and seemed to recede. All day  the drab clouds scudded before the cold north wind. In the gray  twilight, the lake suddenly lay before them, as if it had opened at  their feet. The men rejoiced, the horses lifted their noses and sniffed  the damp air.    The whinnies of the horses, the clank of harness, and splash of water,  the whirl of ducks did not blur out of Jones's keen ear a sound that  made him jump. It was the thump of hoofs, in a familiar beat, beat,  beat. He saw a shadow moving up a ridge. Soon, outlined black against  the yet light sky, a lone buffalo cow stood like a statue. A moment she  held toward the lake, studying the danger, then went out of sight over  the ridge.    Jones spurred his horse up the ascent, which was rather long and steep,  but he mounted the summit in time to see the cow join eight huge,  shaggy buffalo. The hunter reined in his horse, and standing high in  his stirrups, held his hat at arms' length over his head. So he  thrilled to a moment he had sought for two years. The last herd of  American bison was near at hand. The cow would not venture far from the  main herd; the eight stragglers were the old broken-down bulls that had  been expelled, at this season, from the herd by younger and more  vigorous bulls. The old monarchs saw the hunter at the same time his  eyes were gladdened by sight of them, and lumbered away after the cow,  to disappear in the gathering darkness. Frightened buffalo always make  straight for their fellows; and this knowledge contented Jones to  return to the lake, well satisfied that the herd would not be far away  in the morning, within easy striking distance by daylight.    At dark the storm which had threatened for days, broke in a fury of  rain, sleet and hail. The hunters stretched a piece of canvas over the  wheels of the north side of the wagon, and wet and shivering, crawled  under it to their blankets. During the night the storm raged with  unabated strength.    Dawn, forbidding and raw, lightened to the whistle of the sleety gusts.  Fire was out of the question. Chary of weight, the hunters had carried  no wood, and the buffalo chips they used for fuel were lumps of ice.  Grumbling, Adams and Rude ate a cold breakfast, while Jones, munching a  biscuit, faced the biting blast from the crest of the ridge. The middle  of the plain below held a ragged, circular mass, as still as stone. It  was the buffalo herd, with every shaggy head to the storm. So they  would stand, never budging from their tracks, till the blizzard of  sleet was over.    Jones, though eager and impatient, restrained himself, for it was  unwise to begin operations in the storm. There was nothing to do but  wait. Ill fared the hunters that day. Food had to be eaten uncooked.  The long hours dragged by with the little group huddled under icy  blankets. When darkness fell, the sleet changed to drizzling rain. This  blew over at midnight, and a colder wind, penetrating to the very  marrow of the sleepless men, made their condition worse. In the after  part of the night, the wolves howled mournfully.    With a gray, misty light appearing in the east, Jones threw off his  stiff, ice-incased blanket, and crawled out. A gaunt gray wolf, the  color of the day and the sand and the lake, sneaked away, looking back.  While moving and threshing about to warm his frozen blood, Jones  munched another biscuit. Five men crawled from under the wagon, and  made an unfruitful search for the whisky. Fearing it, Jones had thrown  the bottle away. The men cursed. The patient horses drooped sadly, and  shivered in the lee of the improvised tent. Jones kicked the inch-thick  casing of ice from his saddle. Kentuck, his racer, had been spared on  the whole trip for this day's work. The thoroughbred was cold, but as  Jones threw the saddle over him, he showed that he knew the chase  ahead, and was eager to be off. At last, after repeated efforts with  his benumbed fingers, Jones got the girths tight. He tied a bunch of  soft cords to the saddle and mounted.    \"Follow as fast as you can,\" he called to his surly men. \"The buffs  will run north against the wind. This is the right direction for us;  we'll soon leave the sand. Stick to my trail and come a-humming.\"    From the ridge he met the red sun, rising bright, and a keen  northeasterly wind that lashed like a whip. As he had anticipated, his  quarry had moved northward. Kentuck let out into a swinging stride,  which in an hour had the loping herd in sight. Every jump now took him  upon higher ground, where the sand failed, and the grass grew thicker  and began to bend under the wind.    In the teeth of the"]]]
