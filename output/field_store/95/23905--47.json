Those seven days had made a vast amount of difference to Dick Maitland,  so far as his usefulness as a seaman was concerned.  In that  comparatively brief period he had contrived not only to learn the name  and function of every bit of running rigging in the ship, but also to  lay his hand unerringly upon any required halyard, brace, sheet,  downhaul, clewline, or other item of gear in the darkest night; he was  as active and almost as handy aloft as the smartest A.B. in the ship;  and he proved to be a born helmsman, standing his \"trick\" at the wheel  from the very first, and leaving a straighter wake behind him than any  of the other men, even when the ship was scudding before a heavy  following sea.  Mr Sutcliffe, the chief mate, was delighted with his  young _protege_, and declared, in unnecessarily picturesque language,  that he would qualify the boy to perform the duties of an able seaman  before Natal Bluff should heave in sight.    But Dick was to prove his mettle in quite another fashion before long;  for the strong south-westerly breeze which the _Concordia_ encountered  on her seventh day out rapidly developed into so furious a gale that,  after battling with it for some fourteen hours, Captain Roberts decided  to heave-to under close-reefed fore and main topsails, and at eight  bells--noon--the order was accordingly given to clew up and furl the  already reefed courses, and to haul down and stow the fore-topmast  staysail.  This, under the weather conditions of the moment, was a task  requiring the services of all hands, and by the orders of the chief  mate, who was conducting the operations, Dick was stationed at the  weather fore clew-garnet, with three other hands.  The men, having gone  to their stations, were waiting for the word of command when suddenly  the chain main-tack carried away, and the part attached to the sail,  acting like a whip, struck one of the men who was standing by to ease it  away, smashed the poor fellow's right arm above the elbow, shattered his  jaw, and laid open his right cheek from the turn of the jaw to the right  ear, which was all but torn away from the man's head; the force of the  blow also was such as to dash the unfortunate fellow against the  bulwarks so violently that he instantly fell to the deck senseless.    The accident, naturally, at once occasioned the utmost confusion, in the  midst of which the mainsail promptly threshed itself to rags, the mate  sprang down the poop ladder and rushed to the spot, yelling a whole  string of orders, to which nobody paid the slightest attention, and  Dick, with two or three others, abandoned their posts and ran to the  injured man's assistance.    \"Back to your stations, you skowbanks,\" roared the mate.  \"What d'ye  mean by rushing about like a flock of frightened sheep?  D'ye want to  see the ship dismasted?  Here you, Dick, and Joe, pick him up and carry  him below to his bunk until the skipper can attend to him.\"    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" spoke Dick, \"but I am afraid we may do the  poor fellow some further injury if we attempt to carry him below.  I  understand that there is a spare bunk in the deckhouse where the  boatswain and carpenter are quartered.  May we not take him in there?  And, if you will give me leave, I will attend to his hurts.  I have  studied both medicine and surgery, and feel sure that I can do better  for him than anyone else, excepting, of course, a qualified surgeon.\"    \"The dickens!  You don't say so?\" ejaculated the mate, staring at Dick  in amazement.  \"Very well, then, in that case you had better take charge  of him.  And--yes, of course, take him into the deckhouse.  Now, lads,  clew up that fore-course, and be lively with it; haul taut your clew-  garnets, ease up your tack and sheet; man your buntlines and leach-  lines; that's your sort, up with it; away aloft, some of you, and make a  good, snug furl of it!\"    Quickly, yet with the utmost care, the injured seaman was lifted up and  carried into the deckhouse, where, in accordance with Dick's  instructions, he was laid upon the table, a mattress having first been  hurriedly dragged from one of the bunks and placed to receive him.  Then, leaving the patient for the moment in charge of the other man,  Dick hurried to the forecastle and brought up the medicine chest which  had been Humphrey's parting gift to him, and his case of surgical  instruments, which he opened and placed upon the carpenter's chest, to  the undisguised admiration and horror of his assistant, who gazed as  though fascinated at the array of highly polished saws, knives,  scissors, and other instruments of queer and horribly suggestive shape.  Then, dexterously removing the man's jacket and shirt while he still  remained unconscious, Dick rapidly proceeded to give his patient a  systematic overhaul, with the object of ascertaining the precise nature  and extent of his injuries.    He had just completed this examination when the injured man showed signs  of returning consciousness, at the same moment that the skipper, having  heard from the mate the particulars of the accident, came bustling into  the deckhouse with a bottle of brandy in one hand and a tumbler in the  other, intent upon doing something, though he scarcely knew what, for  the relief of the sufferer.  The brandy arrived in the nick of time,  and, seizing the bottle and tumbler unceremoniously, Maitland poured out  a small quantity and held the tumbler to the patient's lips.  With  difficulty the man contrived to swallow about a teaspoonful, which  considerably revived him, and then, with a groan of anguish, strove to  mumble a few words in spite of his broken jaw.  Now, if ever, was the  moment when Humphreys' doctrine of the efficacy of hypnotism might be  effectively tested, and fixing the man's upturned gaze with his own, in  the peculiar manner which Humphreys had described and illustrated, Dick  said to his patient, in a quiet, yet firm and confident tone of voice:    \"Now, Tom, don't attempt to say anything or ask any questions, but  listen to me.  You have met with an accident, but it is not at all  serious; and I am going to put you right and make you quite comfortable.  I shall be obliged to pull you about a bit, but understand this, you  will suffer no pain whatever, and when I have finished with you you will  fall into a quiet and refreshing sleep, from which you will awake  without fever or complication of any sort.  Now, turn over on your left  side, and let me begin by attending to the injuries of your face.\"    To the utter amazement of the skipper and Joe--the man who had assisted  Dick to carry the injured man into the deckhouse--the patient turned  quietly over on his left side as directed, without a groan or any other  sign of suffering, and resigned himself quite contentedly to Dick's  ministrations.  The latter, to all outward appearance perfectly calm and  self-possessed, but inwardly full of astonishment at the complete  success of his first experiment, at once proceeded with quick and deft  hands to arrange in position the shattered fragments of the jaw,  strapping them firmly in place with bandage and sticking plaster; then  he deftly drew together the edges of the gashed cheek, stitched up the  wound, applied an antiseptic dressing, and bound up the injured face in  such a manner that the patient might be enabled to take liquid  nourishment without disturbance of the dressings.  Lastly, he placed the  broken bone of the arm in position, and firmly secured it there with  splints and bandages.  As Dick inserted the last pin in the bandage and  arranged the arm in a comfortable position the patient closed his eyes,  and a minute later his quiet and regular breathing showed that he was  fast asleep!        CHAPTER FOUR.    PHIL GROSVENOR'S PROPOSITION.    \"Well, dash my wig,\" exclaimed the skipper, his face the picture of  blank astonishment, \"that beats the record!  Why, the man's fast asleep,  in spite of all your handling of him!  How in the name of all that's  wonderful did you manage to work that miracle, youngster?\"    \"Oh, easily enough!\" laughed Dick.  \"Everything is easy, you know, sir,  when you understand how to do it.  I learned how to do that, and a great  many other very useful things, under one of the cleverest men in London,  a man who would be famous but for the fact that he prefers to work in  the obscurity of the East-End, and let the poor enjoy the benefit of his  wonderful skill, instead of becoming a fashionable Harley Street  practitioner.  With your permission, sir, I will look after our friend  Tom, here; and I guarantee to have him up and about again, as well as  ever, before we reach the latitude of the Cape.\"    \"You do?\" ejaculated the skipper.  \"Then by George, sir, you shall have  the opportunity.  But, look here, why didn't you tell me that you were a  doctor, when you came and asked me to allow you to work your passage out  to South Africa?\"    \"Well, you see,\" answered Dick, \"I was rather down on my luck just then;  I--or rather, my mother--had learned, only a few days before, that she  had been robbed of all her money; and it was imperative that I should at  once go out into the world and earn more for her, hence my anxiety to go  to South Africa.  But I was so badly off that I couldn't even afford to  pay my fare out there; I therefore determined to work my passage.  And,  as I considered that the fact of my being a doctor would be no  recommendation to you, I decided not to mention it.\"    \"Ah!\" remarked the skipper; \"that is just where you made a big mistake;  your services as a medical man would have been far more valuable to me  than as an ordinary seaman.  Besides, you can do better work than mere  pulling and hauling and dipping your hands into the tar bucket."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#8)"],[1," swarmed; to say nothing of ants; indeed it almost seemed  as though every individual insect upon that particular patch of soil and  vegetation had scented us out and, having found us, was quite determined  that we should never escape them alive.  When presently we again began  to move, it seemed impossible to take a single step without tripping  over a land-crab's hole, or treading upon one of the creatures and  hearing and feeling it crackle and writhe underfoot.  Ugh! it was  horrible.    All these unpleasantnesses were sharply accentuated by the darkness,  which fell upon us like a pall; for now the stars began to be obscured  by great black clouds that came sweeping in from seaward, while the  increasing roar and swish in the boughs overhead seemed to indicate that  the wind was freshening.  Progress was difficult enough, under such  conditions, while we were traversing solid ground and had no special  need to pick our footsteps; how would it be, I wondered, when it came to  our re-crossing the belt of mangroves and mud that lay between us and  the gig?  Then, to add still further to our difficulties, the dank,  heavy, pestilential fog that rises from the tropical African rivers at  nightfall began to gather about us, and in a few minutes, from being  bathed in perspiration from our exertions, we were chilled to the bone,  with our teeth chattering to such an extent that we could scarcely  articulate an intelligible word.    \"Plenty too much fever here come,\" remarked Cupid, while his teeth  clattered together like castanets.  \"Sar, you lib for carry dem quinine  powder dat dem doctor sarve out dis morning?\"    \"Certainly, Cupid,\" jibbered the skipper.  \"M-m-many thanks for the  hint.  M-m-m-mister Fortes--ugh! t-t-take a p-p-pow-ow-der at once.\"    I did so, and handed one to the Krooboy, who simply put it, paper and  all, into his mouth, and swallowed the whole.  Having done this, Cupid  announced, as well as his chattering teeth would permit, that in view of  the fog and the intense darkness it would be simply suicidal for us to  attempt the passage of the mangroves without a light, and that therefore  he proposed to make his way alone to the gig, not only to reassure her  crew as to our safety, but also to procure a lantern.  And he enjoined  the skipper and me to remain exactly where we were until he should  return.  After an absence which seemed to be an age in duration, but  which was really not quite three-quarters of an hour, he reappeared,  accompanied by the coxswain of the boat and two other seamen, who  brought along with them a couple of lighted lanterns.  Thus reinforced  and assisted, we got under way again, and eventually, after a most  fatiguing and dangerous journey, reached the boat and shoved off into  the stream.  The gig was of course provided with a boat compass, and we  knew the exact bearing of the spot where the other boats lay hidden; but  we already knew also how complicated and confusing was the set of the  currents in the river, and how hopeless would consequently be any  attempt to find our friends in that thick fog.  We therefore did not  make the attempt, but, pushing off into the stream until we were clear  of the mosquitoes and other winged plagues that had been tormenting all  hands for so many hours, let go our anchor in one and a half fathoms of  water, and proceeded to take a meal prior to turning-in for the night.    Never in my life before, I think, had I spent so absolutely  uncomfortable a night.  What with the rats, cockroaches, fleas, and  other vermin with which the ship was overrun, to say nothing of the  complication of stenches which poisoned the atmosphere, the midshipmen's  berth aboard the _Psyche_ was by no means an ideal place to sleep in,  but it was luxury compared with the state of affairs in the gig.  For  aboard the _Psyche_ we at least slept dry, while in the boat we were  fully exposed to the encroachments of that vile, malodorous, disease-  laden fog which hemmed us in and pressed down upon us like a saturated  blanket, penetrating everywhere, soaking our clothing until we were wet  to the skin, chilling us to the very marrow, despite our greatcoats, so  that we were too miserable to sleep; while it so completely enveloped us  that, even with the help of half a dozen lanterns, we could not see a  boat's length in any direction.  As the foul water went swirling away  past us great bubbles came rising up from the mud below, from time to  time, bursting as they reached the surface, and giving off little puffs  of noxious, vile-smelling gas that were heavy with disease-germs.  Yet,  singularly enough, when at length the morning dawned and the fog  dispersed, not one of us aboard the gig betrayed the slightest trace of  fever, although, among them, the other boats mustered nearly a dozen  cases.    Our first business, after once more joining forces, was to pull into the  creek and call upon his Majesty, King Olomba; but, upon interviewing  that potentate, through the medium of Cupid, who acted as interpreter,  it at once became evident that our worthy skipper had been made the  victim of an elaborate hoax--even more elaborate, indeed, than we at the  moment expected; for the king not only vigorously disclaimed any  propensity toward slave-hunting or slave-dealing, but went the length of  strenuously denying that the river was ever used at all by slavers; also  he several times endeavoured to divert the conversation into another  channel by pointedly hinting at his readiness to accept a cask of rum as  a present, to which hint the skipper of course turned a deaf ear.  Then,  having got out of the old boy all the information that we could  extract--which, when we came to analyse it, amounted to just nothing--we  carefully searched the bush in the neighbourhood of the town, to see if  we could discover anything in the nature of a barracoon, but found no  trace whatever of any such thing.    Having drawn the creek blank, the skipper next determined to search a  spot known as the Camma Lagoon, some twelve miles farther up the river;  and, the sea-breeze having by this time set in, we stepped the masts and  made sail upon the boats, creeping up the river close to its northern  bank in order to dodge the current as much as possible.    Upon reaching the lagoon we found it to be in reality a sort of bay in  the north bank of the river, some five and a half miles long by about  three and three-quarter miles wide, with an island in the centre of it  occupying so large an extent of its area that at one spot the creek  behind was barely wide enough to allow the passage of a vessel of  moderate tonnage.  The eastern extremity of this creek, however, widened  out until it presented a sheet of water some two miles long by about a  mile and a half in width, with a depth of water ranging from two to  three fathoms.  Furthermore, the island itself and the adjacent banks of  the river were thickly wooded, affording perfect concealment, behind  which half a dozen slavers might lurk undetected; and altogether it  wore, as seen from the river, the aspect of an exceedingly promising  spot.  We therefore lowered the boats' sails, unshipped their masts,  and, keeping a bright look-out all round us, pulled warily into the  lagoon at its eastern extremity.    For the first mile of our passage we detected nothing whatever of a  suspicious character; but upon rounding the eastern extremity of the  island and entering the widest part of the lagoon we sighted two large  canoes paddling furiously up the creek, about a mile ahead of us.  The  captain at once brought his telescope to bear upon these craft, and with  its aid discovered that each canoe was manned by about forty black  paddlers, while the after end of each craft was occupied by some ten or  a dozen men in European dress, most of whom appeared to be armed with  muskets.  These men had the appearance of being either Portuguese or  Spaniards, and their presence in such a spot could mean but one thing,  namely, that there was a barracoon somewhere near at hand.  The skipper  accordingly gave the order to chase the two canoes, to which the boats'  crews responded with a cheer, and laid themselves down to their oars  with such a will that they almost lifted the boats out of the water.  But we had scarcely traversed a distance of half a dozen boats' lengths  when, upon opening up a little indentation in the shore of the mainland,  we saw before us a substantial wharf, long enough to accommodate two  fair-sized craft at once, with a wide open space at the back of it upon  which stood some eight or ten buildings, one of which was unmistakably a  barracoon of enormous size.    With another cheer the course of the boats was at once diverted toward  the wharf; and we had arrived within less than a hundred yards of it  when the deathlike silence which had hitherto prevailed ashore was  pierced by a shrill whistle, in response to which the whole face of the  bush bordering the open space at once began to spit flame, while the air  around us hummed and whined to the passage of a perfect storm of bullets  and slugs, among which could be detected the hum of round shot,  apparently nine-pounders, the gig weathered the storm unscathed; but  upon glancing back I saw that the other boats had been less fortunate,  there being a gap or two here and there where a moment before a man had  sat, while certain of the oars were at that moment slipping through the  rowlocks to trail in the water by their lanyards a second later.  Here  and there, too, could be seen a man hastily binding up a wounded limb or  head, either his own or that of a shipmate.    The skipper sprang to his feet in the stern-sheets of the gig, and drew  his sword.    \"Hurrah, lads!\" he shouted.  \"Give way, and get alongside that wharf as  quickly as you can.  Then let every man run his hardest for the shelter  of the buildings, carrying his musket and ammunition with him.  "]]]
