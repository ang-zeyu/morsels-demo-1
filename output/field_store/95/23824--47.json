At present 14 or 15 rooms may be traced on the ground  and the whole structure may have comprised 30 rooms. The wall lines are  not regular. In the western end of the structure there is a narrow  passageway into a large room in the center. Such passageways, while  often seen in the valley pueblos, are rare in these canyons. The three  rooms to the south of the passageway appear to have been added after the  rest of the structure was completed, and diminished in size regularly by  a series of steps or insets in the northern or passage wall.      [Illustration: Fig. 6--Ground plan of Pakashi-izini ruins, Canyon    del Muerto.]    The other portion of the ruin shows the remains of about 40 rooms on the  ground, in addition to three kivas; there may have been 60 rooms in this  part of the settlement, or 85 or 90 rooms altogether. The population  could not have been over 55 or 60 persons, or about 12 families. In  other words, it appears that, owing to the peculiarities of conditions  under which they lived, and of the ground plan which resulted, the  largest settlement of this class in the canyons, extending over 400 feet  in one direction, provided homes for a very limited number of people. As  it is probable that each family had one or more outlooks, occupied in  connection with their horticultural operations, it will readily be seen  that only a small number of inhabitants might leave a large number of  house remains, and that it is not necessary to assume either a large  population or a long period of occupancy.    The kivas are clustered in the lower end of the settlement, and all  appear to have been inclosed within walls or other buildings. Two of  them are fairly well preserved; of the third only a fragment remains.  The inclosure of the kivas is a suggestive feature, which will be  discussed later, as will also the square shaft shown on the plan as  attached to the principal kiva.    It will be noticed that in several places where bowlders occur within  the limits of the settlement they have been incorporated into the walls  and form part of them. In two places they have altered the direction of  walls and produced irregularities in the plan. Elsewhere the face of a  rock has been prolonged by a wall carried out to continue it, as in the  front wall of the principal kiva apartment. This apartment appears to  have been entered from the west through a passageway. This is an  anomalous feature and suggests modernness.      [Illustration: Fig. 7--Ground plan of a ruin in Canyon del Muerto.]    Figure 7 is a ground plan of another ruin in Del Muerto. There is a  slight cove or bay in the cliff at the point where the ruin occurs, and  the ground, which is on the level of the bottom lands, is strewn with  large bowlders, as in the example last described. But few remains of  walls are now observable, and there are traces of only one kiva. This  was situated near the outer edge of the settlement. The wall lines are  irregular and the disposition and size of the bowlders are such that it  is improbable that this site was ever occupied by a large cluster of  rooms. On the left of the plan will be seen a small room or storage cist  still intact. At the point marked > in the center of the site a burial  cist was found and excavated in 1884 by Mr Thomas V. Keam. It contained  the remains of a child, almost perfectly desiccated. It is said that  when the remains were first removed the color of the iris could be  distinguished. The specimen was subsequently deposited in the National  Museum.      [Illustration: Fig. 8--Ground plan of a ruin in Tseonitsosi canyon.]    A ruin which occurs in Tse-on-i-tso-si canyon, near the mouth of De  Chelly, is shown in plan in figure 8. There were two kivas, one of which  was benched. The number of rooms connected with them is remarkably  small--there could not have been more than six, if there were that  many--and the character of the site is such as to preclude the  possibility of other rooms in the immediate vicinity. Some of the walls  are still standing, and exhibit a fair degree of skill in masonry.      [Illustration: Fig. 9--Ground plan of a much obliterated ruin.]    A type of which there are many examples is shown in plan in figure 9.  These ruins occur on the flat, next the cliff, which is seldom bayed and  overhangs but slightly. They are usually so much obliterated that only  careful scrutiny reveals the presence of wall lines, and walls standing  to a height of 6 inches above the ground are rare. In the example  illustrated no traces of a kiva can be found, but the almost complete  destruction of the walls might account for this. There is every reason  to suppose that these ruins are of the same class as those described  above, the remains of home villages located without reference to  defense, and no reason to suppose otherwise. They are probably instances  where, owing to exposed situation, early abandonment, and possibly also  proximity to later establishments, destruction has proceeded at a  greater rate than in other examples.      [Illustration: Fig. 10--Ground plan of a ruin in Canyon de Chelly.]    Ruins of the class under discussion were not confined to any part of the  canyons, but were located wherever the conditions were favorable. An  example which occurs in the lower part of the canyon, at the point  marked 3 on the map, is shown in plan in figure 10. It occurs at the  back of a deep cove in a little branch canyon, and was at one time quite  an extensive village. It was located on a slight slope or raised place  next the cliffs and overhung by them. A stone dropped from the top of  the cliffs would fall 45 or 50 feet out from their base. There are  remains of three kivas. The central one, which was 12 feet in diameter,  still shows nearly all its periphery, and the wall is in one place  3 feet high. The western kiva is now almost obliterated, but it can  still be made out, and shows a diameter of 15 feet. It is 50 feet west  of the central kiva and on a level about 8 feet below it, being only  about 3 feet above the bottom land. East of the central kiva, and  between it and a large bowlder, there was another, of which only a part  now remains.    North of the central kiva, and extending nearly to the cliff behind,  there are remains of rooms. One corner is still standing to a height of  3 to 4 feet. The western wall was smoothly plastered outside and was  pierced by a narrow notched doorway. The northern wall has an opening  still intact, shown in plate LVIII; it is 2 feet high and 14 inches  wide, with a lintel composed of six small sticks about an inch in  diameter, laid side by side. The sticks are surmounted by a flat stone,  very roughly shaped and separated from them by an inch of mud plaster or  mortar. The masonry is exceptionally well executed, that of the northern  wall being composed of large stones carefully chinked and rubbed down.  The chinking appears to have been carried through in bands, producing a  decorative effect, resembling some of the masonry of the Chaco ruins.  The western wall is composed of larger stones laid up more roughly with  less chinking, and appears to have been a later addition. On the back  wall of the cave are marks of walls showing a number of additional  rooms, and there is no doubt that at one time there was quite an  extensive settlement here.    Around the corner from the last example, as it were (at the point marked  4 on the map), and at the mouth of a little canyon that opens out from  the head of the cove, the ruin shown in plate XLVI occurs. The village  was located on the canyon bottom, in a shallow cove hardly 25 feet deep,  but the view over the bottom is almost closed by a large sand dune, bare  on top and but scantily covered on the sides with grass and weeds. Were  it not for this dune, the site of the ruin would command one of the best  areas of cultivable land in the canyon, but apparently an extensive  outlook was not a desideratum. The slight elevation of the site above  the level of the bottom lands is shown in the illustration.      [Illustration: Plate XLVI    Village Ruin in Canyon De Chelly]    The village was not a large one, having been occupied probably by only  two families, yet there are traces of two kivas. That on the west is so  far obliterated that its outline can be made out only with difficulty.  That on the east still shows a part of its wall to a height of about a  foot. The plan, figure 11, shows the general arrangement. Some of the  walls are still standing to a height of 2 or 3 feet, and at the eastern  end of the ruin there is a room with walls 6 feet high. More than the  usual amount of mud mortar was used in the construction of the walls of  this room, and the interstices were filled with this, chinking with  small stones being but slightly practiced. The masonry of the other  walls is rougher, with even less chinking, and some of them show later  additions which did not follow the main lines. The eastern room had two  openings and the tops of the walls are apparently finished, for there  are no marks of roof timbers. The room may have been roofless, but the  same effect might have been produced by recent Navaho repairs and  alterations. In the exterior wall, at the southeastern corner, there is  a series of hand-holes, as though access to the interior were sometimes  had in this way, but the hand-holes are later than the wall. On the back  wall of the cove there are a number of pictographs.      [Illustration: Fig. 11--Ground plan of a village ruin.]      [Illustration: Fig. 12--Ground plan of kivas in Canyon de Chelly.]    Just above the mouth of Del Muerto and on the opposite side of the main  canyon, at the point marked 17 on the map, there was a village on the  canyon bottom.

I blinked in admiration while I waited for him to get his breath  so I could hand him Kyral's token.    In the light of the fire I saw what I'd half expected: he was the second  of the Dry-towners who'd tried to rough me up in the spaceport cafe.  Cuinn barely glanced at the cut stone and tossed it back, pointing out  one of the packhorses. \"Load your personal gear on that one, then get  busy and show this mush-headed wearer of sandals\"--an insult carrying  particularly filthy implications in Shainsa--\"how to fasten a  packstrap.\"    He drew breath and began to swear at the luckless youngster again, and I  relaxed. He evidently hadn't recognized me, either. I took the strap in  my hand, guiding it through the saddle loop. \"Like that,\" I told the  kid, and Cuinn stopped swearing long enough to give me a curt nod of  acknowledgment and point out a heap of boxed and crated objects.    \"Help him load up. We want to get clear of the city by daybreak,\" he  ordered, and went off to swear at someone else.    Kyral turned up at dawn, and a few minutes later the camp had vanished  into a small scattering of litter and we were on our way.    Kyral's caravan, in spite of Cuinn's cursing, was well-managed and  well-handled. The men were Dry-towners, eleven of them, silent and  capable and most of them very young. They were cheerful on the trail,  handled the pack animals competently, during the day, and spent most of  the nights grouped around the fire, gambling silently on the fall of the  cut-crystal prisms they used for dice.    Three days out of the Kharsa I began to worry about Cuinn.    It was of course a spectacular piece of bad luck to find all three of  the men from the spaceport cafe in Kyral's caravan. Kyral had obviously  not known me, and even by daylight he paid no attention to me except to  give an occasional order. The second of the three was a gangling kid who  probably never gave me a second look, let alone a third.    But Cuinn was another matter. He was a man my own age, and his fierce  eyes had a shrewdness in them that I did not trust. More than once I  caught him watching me, and on the two or three occasions when he drew  me into conversation, I found his questions more direct than Dry-town  good manners allowed. I weighed the possibility that I might have to  kill him before we reached Shainsa.    We crossed the foothills and began to climb upward toward the mountains.  The first few days I found myself short of breath as we worked upward  into thinner air, then my acclimatization returned and I began to fall  into the pattern of the days and nights on the trail. The Trade City  was still a beacon in the night, but its glow on the horizon grew dimmer  with each day's march.    Higher we climbed, along dangerous trails where men had to dismount and  let the pack animals pick their way, foot by foot. Here in these  altitudes the sun at noonday blazed redder and brighter, and the  Dry-towners, who come from the parched lands in the sea-bottoms, were  burned and blistered by the fierce light. I had grown up under the  blazing sun of Terra, and a red sun like Wolf, even at its hottest,  caused me no discomfort. This alone would have made me suspect. Once  again I found Cuinn's fierce eyes watching me.    As we crossed the passes and began to descend the long trail through the  thick forests, we got into nonhuman country. Racing against the Ghost  Wind, we skirted the country around Charin, and the woods inhabited by  the terrible Ya-men, birdlike creatures who turn cannibal when the Ghost  Wind blows.    Later the trail wound through thicker forests of indigo trees and  grayish-purple brushwood, and at night we heard the howls of the catmen  of these latitudes. At night we set guards about the caravan, and the  dark spaces and shadows were filled with noises and queer smells and  rustlings.    Nevertheless, the day's marches and the night watches passed without  event until the night I shared guard with Cuinn. I had posted myself at  the edge of the camp, the fire behind me. The men were sleeping rolls of  snores, huddled close around the fire. The animals, hobbled with double  ropes, front feet to hind feet, shifted uneasily and let out long  uncanny whines.    I heard Cuinn pacing behind me. I heard a rustle at the edge of the  forest, a stir and whisper beyond the trees, and turned to speak to him,  then saw him slipping away toward the outskirts of the clearing.    For a moment I thought nothing of it, thinking that he was taking a few  steps toward the gap in the trees where he had disappeared. I suppose I  had the idea that he had slipped away to investigate some noise or  shadow, and that I should be at hand.    Then I saw the flicker of lights beyond the trees--light from the  lantern Cuinn had been carrying in his hand! He was signaling!    I slipped the safety clasp from the hilt of my skean and went after him.  In the dimming glow of the fire I fancied I saw luminous eyes watching  me, and the skin on my back crawled. I crept up behind him and leaped.  We went down in a tangle of flailing legs and arms, and in less than a  second he had his skean out and I was gripping his wrist, trying  desperately to force the blade away from my throat.    I gasped, \"Don't be a fool! One yell and the whole camp will be awake!  Who were you signaling?\"    In the light of the fallen lantern, lips drawn back in a snarl, he  looked almost inhuman. He strained at the knife for a moment, then  dropped it. \"Let me up,\" he said.    I got up and kicked the fallen skean toward him. \"Put that away. What in  hell were you doing, trying to bring the catmen down on us?\"    For a moment he looked taken aback, then his fierce face closed down  again and he said wrathfully, \"Can't a man walk away from the camp  without being half strangled?\"    I glared at him, but realized I really had nothing to go by. He might  have been answering a call of nature, and the movement of the lantern  accidental. And if someone had jumped me from behind, I might have  pulled a knife on him myself. So I only said, \"Don't do it again. We're  all too jumpy.\"    There were no other incidents that night, or the next. The night after,  while I lay huddled in my shirtcloak and blanket by the fire, I saw  Cuinn slip out of his bedroll and steal away. A moment later there was a  gleam in the darkness, but before I could summon the resolve to get up  and face it out with him, he returned, looked cautiously at the snoring  men, and crawled back into his blankets.    While we were unpacking at the next camp, Kyral halted beside me. \"Heard  anything queer lately? I've got the notion we're being trailed. We'll be  out of these forests tomorrow, and after that it's clear road all the  way to Shainsa. If anything's going to happen, it will happen tonight.\"    I debated speaking to him about Cuinn's signals. No, I had my own  business waiting for me in Shainsa. Why mix myself up in some other,  private intrigue?    He said, \"I'm putting you and Cuinn on watch again. The old men doze  off, and the young fellows get to daydreaming or fooling around. That's  all right most of the time, but I want someone who'll keep his eyes open  tonight. Did you ever know Cuinn before this?\"    \"Never set eyes on him.\"    \"Funny, I had the notion--\" He shrugged, turned away, then stopped.    \"Don't think twice about rousing the camp if there's any disturbance.  Better a false alarm than an ambush that catches us all in our blankets.  If it came to a fight, we might be in a bad way. We all carry skeans,  but I don't think there's a shocker in the whole camp, let alone a gun.  You don't have one by any chance?\"    After the men had turned in, Cuinn patrolling the camp, halted a minute  beside me and cocked his head toward the rustling forest.    \"What's going on in there?\"    \"Who knows? Catmen on the prowl, probably, thinking the horses would  make a good meal, or maybe that we would.\"    \"Think it will come to a fight?\"    \"I wouldn't know.\"    He surveyed me for a moment without speaking. \"And if it did?\"    \"We'd fight.\" Then I sucked in my breath, for Cuinn had spoken Terran  Standard, and I, without thinking had answered in the same language. He  grinned, showing white teeth filed to a point.    \"I thought so!\"    I seized his shoulder and demanded roughly, \"And what are you going to  do about it?\"    \"That depends on you,\" he answered, \"and what you want in Shainsa. Tell  me the truth. What were you doing in the Terran Zone?\" He gave me no  chance to answer. \"You know who Kyral is, don't you?\"    \"A trader,\" I said, \"who pays my wages and minds his own affairs.\" I  moved backward, hand on my skean, braced for a sudden rush. He made no  aggressive motion, however.    \"Kyral told me you'd been asking questions about Rakhal Sensar,\" he  said. \"Clever. Now I, for one, could have told you he'd never set eyes  on Rakhal. I--\"    He broke off, hearing a noise in the forest, a long eerie howl. I  muttered, \"If you've brought them down on us--\"    He shook his head urgently. \"I had to take that chance, to get word to  the others. It won't work. Where's the girl?\"    I hardly heard him. I was hearing twigs snap, and silent sneaking feet.  I turned for a yell that would rouse the camp and Cuinn grabbed me hard,  saying insistently, \"Quick! Where's the girl! Go back and tell her it  won't work! If Kyral suspected--\"    He never finished the sentence. Just behind us came another of the long  eerie howls. I knocked Cuinn away, and suddenly the night was filled  with crouching forms that came down on us like a whirlwind.    I shouted madly as the camp came alive with men struggling out of  blankets, fighting for life itself. I ran hard, still shouting, for the  enclosure where we had tied the horses. A catman, slim and black-furred,  was crouched and cutting the hobble-strings of the nearest animal. I  hurled myself on him. He exploded, clawing,"]]]
