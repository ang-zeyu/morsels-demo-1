Our second law tells us that the original form of a word or of its  root must be preserved as far as possible.  Most of the words referred  to above in which single consonants are doubled or not doubled in  violation of the general rule are derived from the Latin, usually through  the French, and if we were familiar with those languages we should have a  key to their correct spelling.  But even without such thorough knowledge,  we may learn a few of the methods of derivation in those languages,  especially the Latin, as well as the simpler methods in use in the English.    Certain changes in the derived words are always made, as, for instance, the  dropping of the silent _e_ when a syllable beginning with a vowel is added.    Rule.  Silent _e_ at the end of a word is dropped whenever a syllable  beginning with a vowel is added.    This rule is not quite universal, though nearly so.  The silent _e_ is  always retained when the vowel at the beginning of the added syllable  would make a soft _c_ or _g_ hard, as in _serviceable, changeable,_ etc.  In _changing, chancing,_ etc., the _i_ of the added syllable is sufficient  to make the _c_ or _g_ retain its soft sound.  In such words as _cringe_  and _singe_ the silent _e_ is retained even before _i_ in order to avoid  confusing the words so formed with other words in which the _ng_ has a  nasal sound; thus we have _singeing_ to avoid confusion with _singing,_  though we have _singed_ in which the _e_ is dropped before _ed_ because the  dropping of it causes no confusion.  Formerly the silent _e_ was retained  in _moveable_; but now we write _movable,_ according to the rule.    Of course when the added syllable begins with a consonant, the silent  _e_ is not dropped, since dropping it would have the effect of  shortening the preceding vowel by making it stand before two consonants.    A few monosyllables ending in two vowels, one of which is silent _e,_  are exceptions: _duly, truly_; also _wholly_.    Also final _y_ is changed to _i_ when a syllable is added, unless that  added syllable begins with _i_ and two _i_'s would thus come together.  _I_ is a vowel never doubled.  Th{u} is we have _citified,_  but _citifying_.    We have already seen that final consonants may be doubled under certain  circumstances when a syllable is added.    These are nearly all the changes in spelling that are possible when  words are formed by adding syllables; but changes in pronunciation and  vowel values are often affected, as we have seen in _nation_ (_a_ long)  and _national_ (_a_ short).    Prefixes.  But words may be formed by prefixing syllables, or by combining  two or more words into one.  Many of these formations were effected in the  Latin before the words were introduced into English; but we can study the  principles governing them and gain a key to the spelling of many English  words.    In English we unite a preposition with a verb by placing it after the  verb and treating it as an adverb.  Thus we have \"breaking in,\"  \"running over,\" etc.  In Latin the preposition in such cases was  prefixed to the word; and there were particles used as prefixes which  were never used as prepositions.  We should become familiar with the  principal Latin prefixes and always take them into account in the  spelling of English words.  The principal Latin prefixes are:    ab (abs)---from  ad---to  ante---before  bi (bis)---twice  circum (circu)---around  con---with  contra(counter)---against  de---down, from  dis---apart, not  ex---out of, away from  extra---beyond  in---in, into, on; _also_ not (another word)  inter---between=  non---not  ob---in front of, in the way of  per---through  post---after  pre---before  pro---for, forth  re---back or again  retro---backward  se---aside  semi---half  sub---under  super---above, over  trans---over, beyond  ultra---beyond  vice---instead of.    Of these prefixes, those ending in a single consonant are likely to  change that consonant for euphony to the consonant beginning the word  to which the prefix is attached.  Thus _ad_ drops the _d_ in _ascend,_  becomes _ac_ in _accord, af_ in _affiliate, an_ in _annex, ap_ in  _appropriate, at_ in _attend; con_ becomes _com_ in _commotion,_ also  in _compunction_ and _compress, cor_ in _correspond, col_ in _collect,  co_ in _co-equal_; _dis_ becomes _dif_ in _differ_; _ex_ becomes _e_ in  _eject, ec_ in _eccentric, ef_ in _effect_; _in_ becomes _il_ in  _illuminate, im_ in _import, ir_ in _irreconcilable; ob_ becomes _op_  in _oppress, oc_ in _occasion, of_ in _offend_; and _sub_ becomes _suc_  in _succeed, sup_ in _support, suf_ in _suffix, sug_ in _suggest,  sus_ in _sustain_.  The final consonant is changed to a consonant that  can be easily pronounced before the consonant with which the following  syllable begins.  Following the rule that the root must be changed as  little as possible, it is always the prefix, not the root,  which is compelled to yield to the demands of euphony.    A little reflection upon the derivation of words will thus often give  us a key to the spelling.  For instance, suppose we are in doubt whether  _irredeemable_ has two _r_'s or only one: we now that _redeem_ is a  root, and therefore the _ir_ must be a prefix, and the two _r_'s are  accounted for,--- indeed are necessary in order to prevent our losing  sight of the derivation and meaning of the word.  In the same way, we can  never be in doubt as to the two _m_'s in _commotion, commencement,_ etc.    We have already noted the tendency of _y_ to become _i_ in the middle  of a word.  The exceptional cases are chiefly derivatives from the  Greek, and a study of the Greek prefixes will often give us a hint in  regard to the spelling of words containing _y_.  These prefixes,  given here in full for convenience, are:    a (an)---without, not  amphi---both, around  ana---up, back, through=  anti---against, opposite  apo (ap)---from  cata---down    dia---through  en (em)---in  epi (ep)---upon  hyper---over, excessive  hypo---under=  meta (met)---beyond, change  syn (sy, syl, sym)---with, together    In Greek words also we will find _ph_ with the sound of _f_.  We know that _symmetrical, hypophosphite, metaphysics, emphasis,_ etc.,  are Greek because of the key we find in the prefix, and we are thus  prepared for the _y_'s and _ph_'s.  _F_ does not exist in the Greek  alphabet (except as ph) and so we shall never find it in words derived  from the Greek.    The English prefixes are not so often useful in determining peculiar  spelling, but for completeness we give them here:    a---at, in, on (ahead)  be---to make, by (benumb)  en (em)---in, on, to make (encircle, empower)  for---not, from (forbear)  fore---before (forewarn)  mis---wrong, wrongly (misstate)  out---beyond (outbreak)  over---above (overruling)  to---the, this (to-night)  un---not, opposite  act (unable, undeceive)  under---beneath (undermine)  with---against, from (withstand)      CHAPTER III.    WORD-BUILDING---RULES AND APPLICATIONS.    There are a few rules and applications of the principles of word-formation  which may be found fully treated in the chapter on \"Orthography\" at the  beginning of the dictionary, but which we present here very briefly,  together with a summary of principles already discussed.    Rule 1.  _F, l,_ and _s_ at the end of a monosyllable after a single  vowel are commonly doubled.  The exceptions are the cases in which _s_  forms the plural or possessive case of a noun, or third person singular  of the verb, and the following words: _clef, if, of, pal, sol, as, gas,  has, was, yes, gris, his, is, thus, us.  L_ is not doubled at the end  of words of more than one syllable, as _parallel, willful,_ etc.    Rule 2.  No other consonants thus situated are doubled.  Exceptions:  _ebb, add, odd, egg, inn, bunn, err, burr, purr, butt, fizz, fuzz,  buzz,_ and a few very uncommon words, for which see the chapter in the  dictionary above referred to.    Rule 3.  A consonant standing at the end of a word immediately after a  diphthong or double vowel is never doubled.  The word _guess_ is only an  apparent exception, since _u_ does not form a combination with _e_ but  merely makes the _g_ hard.    Rule 4.  Monosyllables ending in the sound of _ic_ represented by _c_  usually take _k_ after the _c_, as in _back, knock,_ etc.  Exceptions:  _talc, zinc, roc, arc,_ and a few very uncommon words.  Words of more  than one syllable ending in _ic_ or _iac_ do not take _k_ after the _c_  (except _derrick_), as for example _elegiac, cubic, music,_ etc.  If the _c_ is preceded by any other vowel than _i_ or _ia, k_ is added  to the _c_, as in _barrack, hammock, wedlock_.  Exceptions:  _almanac, havoc,_ and a very few uncommon words.    Rule 5.  To preserve the hard sound of _c_ when a syllable is added  which begins with _e, i,_ or _y, k_ is placed after final _c_,  as in _trafficking, zincky, colicky_.    Rule 6.  _X_ and _h_ are never doubled, _v_ and _j_ seldom.  _G_ with the soft sound cannot be doubled, because then the first _g_  would be made hard.  Example: _mag'ic.  Q_ always appears with _u_  following it, and here _u_ has the value of the consonant _w_ and in no  way combines or is counted with the vowel which may follow it.  For  instance _squatting_ is written as if _squat_ contained but one vowel.    Rule 7.  In simple derivatives a single final consonant following a  single vowel in a syllable that receives an accent is doubled when  another syllable beginning with a vowel is added.    Rule 8.  When accent comes on a syllable standing next to the last,  it has a tendency to lengthen the vowel; but on syllables farther from  the end, the tendency is to shorten the vowel without doubling the  consonant.  For example, _na'tion_ (_a_ long), but _na'tional_  (_a_ short); _gram'mar,_ but _grammat'ical_.    Rule 9.  Silent _e_ at the end of a word is usually dropped  when a syllable beginning with a vowel is added."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#8)"],[1," to speak to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants in the open  air. He and the poet, arm in arm, still talking together as they went  along, proceeded to the spot. It was a small nook among the hills, with  a gray precipice behind, the stern front of which was relieved by the  pleasant foliage of many creeping plants, that made a [v]tapestry for  the naked rock by hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles. At  a small elevation above the ground, set in a rich framework of verdure,  there appeared a [v]niche, spacious enough to admit a human figure. Into  this natural pulpit Ernest ascended and threw a look of familiar  kindness around upon his audience. They stood, or sat, or reclined upon  the grass, as seemed good to each, with the departing sunshine falling  over them. In another direction was seen the Great Stone Face, with the  same cheer, combined with the same solemnity, in its benignant aspect.    Ernest began to speak, giving to the people of what was in his heart and  mind. His words had power, because they accorded with his thoughts; and  his thoughts had reality and depth, because they harmonized with the  life which he had always lived. The poet, as he listened, felt that the  being and character of Ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he  had ever written. His eyes glistening with tears, he gazed  reverentially at the venerable man, and said within himself that never  was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild,  sweet, thoughtful countenance with the glory of white hair diffused  about it. At a distance, but distinctly to be seen, high up in the  golden light of the setting sun, appeared the Great Stone Face, with  hoary mists around it, like the white hairs around the brow of Ernest.    At that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter,  the face of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expression, so full of  benevolence, that the poet, by an irresistible impulse, threw his arms  aloft, and shouted:    \"Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great Stone  Face!\"    Then all the people looked and saw that what the deep-sighted poet said  was true. The prophecy was fulfilled.

[Illustration: Priscilla and John Alden]          THE COURTSHIP OF MILES STANDISH          I        In the Old Colony days, in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims,      To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,      Clad in [v]doublet and hose, and boots of [v]Cordovan leather,      Strode, with a martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain.      Buried in thought he seemed, with hands behind him, and pausing      Ever and anon to behold the glittering weapons of warfare,      Hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber,--      Cutlass and corslet of steel, and his trusty [v]sword of Damascus.      Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic,      Broad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews of iron;      Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already      Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.      Near him was seated John Alden, his friend, and household companion,      Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window;      Fair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion.      Youngest of all was he of the men who came in the May Flower.        (Standish takes up a book and reads a moment.)      Suddenly breaking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,      Spake, in the pride of his heart, Miles Standish the Captain of          Plymouth.      \"Look at these arms,\" he said, \"the warlike weapons that hang here      Burnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection!      This is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this          breastplate,      Well, I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish;      Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet.      Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish      Would at this moment be mold, in the grave in the Flemish morasses.\"      Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:      \"Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;      He in his mercy preserved you to be our shield and our weapon!\"      Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:      \"See how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;      That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.      Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent [v]adage;      So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your inkhorn.      Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,      Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,      Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,      And, like Caesar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!\"      All was silent again; the Captain continued his reading.      Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling      Writing epistles important to go next day by the May Flower,      Ready to sail on the morrow, or next day at latest, God willing,      Homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,      Letters written by Alden and full of the name of Priscilla,      Full of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla.      Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla,      Till the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret      Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla!      Finally closing his book, with a bang of its [v]ponderous cover,      Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket,      Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth:      \"When you have finished your work, I have something important to tell          you.      Be not however in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!\"      Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,      Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:      \"Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen,      Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.\"      Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his phrases:      \"'Tis not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.      This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;      Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.      Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary;      Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.      Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla,      Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever      There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,      Two have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla      Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.      Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,      Being a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part.      Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth;      Say that a blunt old captain, a man not of words but of actions,      Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.      Not in these words, you know,"]]]
