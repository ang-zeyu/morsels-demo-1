But the innumerable horde swam in legions after  him, and when he reached his tower on the island thinking at least he  would be safe there, the mice followed him, gnawing the tower and  tearing for themselves an entrance with their sharp teeth, till at  last they reached him whom they sought. The cruel man was devoured by  the mice, which attacked him by scores. In his despair he offered his  soul to the Evil One, if he would release his body from such awful  agony. The Evil Spirit came, freed his body, but took his soul away  for himself.    Thus runs the legend. History however speaks less severely of Hatto,  the imperious prelate.           *       *       *       *       *    His great ambition was his desire of power. He was the founder of the  temporal power which the seat of Mayence obtained, and which later on  made it the first bishopric of the kingdom, but he was always hated by  the citizens, who suffered much owing to his proud, despotic  character.    It is true that he was the founder of the toll which ships in olden  times were obliged to pay on the Rhine, so that this fact and many  other cruel exactions of his, have helped to evolve the terrible  legend of the Mouse-Tower.          THE VALLEY OF THE NAHE    KREUZNACH    A mighty draught      Once upon a time in the high castle called Rheingrafenstein near  Kreuznach, the flower of the knights belonging to the Rhine country  were assembled.    They were powerful warriors, these nobles of ancient rank, but the  most prominent among them was the host himself, the proud Rhine Count.  Many a cup had he already emptied to the health of his distinguished  guests, and rising up once more from his richly carved chair he cast a  look over the brilliant assembly and said in a boastful tone:    \"I have got a knight's high boot here, my noble lords. A courier left  it behind him once. Now I promise on the honour of my house that  whoever will drink it empty at one draught, to him I will give the  village of Hueffelsheim yonder.\"    The count, smiling at the novelty of the challenge, took the boot from  his attendant's hand, caused it to be filled to the brim, and held up  this novel cup to his guests. \"Tis a fair challenge! Come on whoever  will dare!\" said he.    Among the illustrious company present there was one, John of  Sponheim, a knight well-known in the country for his enormous drinking  powers; but he remained unmoved at these defiant words, only looking  inquiringly at his neighbour, Knight Weinhart of Dhaun, who in great  perplexity, was striving to hide his head behind a large goblet. Old  Floersheimer, another knight whose thirst usually seemed unquenchable,  stroked his gray beard doubtfully, while Kunz of Stromberg, a tall  thin man, shook his head at the thought of the after-effects which  such a draught would bring. Even the chaplain of the castle, who  attributed his effective intoning of high-mass to the virtues of the  Rhenish wine which he indulged in so freely, looked longingly at the  boot, but had not the courage to attempt such a rash act.    Suddenly a knight, Boos of Waldeck by name rose. He was a muscular man  with the strength of a bear. In a voice of thunder he banged his  mighty fist upon the table and said scornfully, \"Bring me that little  boot!\"    The distinguished company stared at him in great astonishment, but  Boos of Waldeck, taking the boot in his sturdy fist, cried out. \"Your  health, my lords!\"    Then flourishing it in the air, he emptied the boot at one draught.    When this act was accomplished, Boos threw himself heavily into his  chair, and addressing the master of the ceremonies, said with a  humorous twinkle in his eye:    \"Did the courier not leave the other boot too? I might possibly win a  second bet, and thus acquire the village of Roxheim into the bargain.\"    The count looked much abashed, but the noble guests only laughed  heartily at the joke.    Thus stout Boos of Waldeck became lord of the village of Hueffelsheim.          The Foundation of Castle Sponheim      The following legend tells us about the origin of Castle Sponheim in  the valley of the Nahe. Once a Knight of Ravensberg was eagerly wooing  the beautiful young Countess of Heimburg, but there was a serious  obstacle in his path to success. Some years before a Ravensberg had  killed a Heimburg in a quarrel, and since that time a bitter feud had  divided the two houses. The brave knight felt this bitterly, but in  spite of it he did not leave off his wooing. The young countess was  much touched by his constancy, and one day she spoke thus to her  impetuous suitor:    \"My lord, if you will dare to go to the Holy Land there to expiate the  sins of your fathers, and bring me back a relic from the sepulchre of  our Redeemer, in that same hour your suit will be heard.\"    The knight in great joy kissed the maiden's slender hand and departed,  carrying the memory of her sweet smile away in his heart.    Just at this time the call of the Emperor Barbarossa, now an old man,  sounded throughout the land, and the Knight of Ravensberg did not  neglect the opportunity, but hastened forth to join the imperial army.    The expedition was a long and terrible one, and the troops wearily  made their way across the desert plains of Palestine.    The knight, though a brave man, had no special love for warlike  adventures, and during these exhausting marches he thought sorrowfully  of his quiet castle on the Nahe; of how he used to lie down there in  peace and safety at night without being in fear of the Saracens who,  under cover of darkness would break in waving their scimitars in air,  an event which was a nightly occurrence on this expedition.    Ravensberg however fought bravely in many a battle, and after the  deaths of Barbarossa and his son, he joined the army of Richard the  Lion-hearted.    Through all this anxious time he never forgot his dear one at home,  and his longing for her became stronger every day, till it seemed to  get beyond endurance.    King Richard was called back to England on some urgent state-affairs,  and the Knight of Ravensberg was among the few companions-in-arms who  embarked with him. The brave knight was very happy, and while the  king's ship was sailing along the coast of Greece and up the blue  Adriatic Sea, he would often stand on deck and weave bright dreams of  the future; sometimes when no one was near, he would pull out a little  black ebony box set with precious stones, on which a woman's name was  written in golden letters; the interior was beautifully lined with  costly silk; and a small splinter of wood lay within which the knight  would kiss most reverently. He had paid a large sum of money for it  in the Holy Land, where he had bought it from a Jewish merchant. This  man had sworn to him that this fragment was from the cross to which  the Son of God had been nailed.    The knight was very happy during this long homeward journey, but a  great misfortune awaited him. Just as the crusaders came in sight of  Italy their vessel was wrecked. The King of England, the Knight of  Ravensberg, and a few others were saved with great difficulty, and  brought to land. But our poor knight was inconsolable; he had held the  precious little box high above him in the water, but a mighty wave had  torn it from him, and on opening his eyes he found himself on shore.  The holy relic had saved him, but he had lost his treasure, and now  all hope of his promised happiness was gone.           *       *       *       *       *    One day a weary and dispirited crusader returned to the castle of  Heimburg. He announced his arrival to the young countess most humbly,  but she, her lovely face lighted up by a bright smile, hurried to meet  the knight whose sunburnt countenance betokened great hardships.    She listened silently to his mournful story, then raising her  beautiful head she asked: \"Was not the little box set with precious  stones and was not my name in golden letters on it?\"    \"Yes, noble lady,\" said the knight, the bitterness of his  disappointment newly awakened, \"And now it lies at the bottom of the  sea in spite of my fervent prayers to St. George to save the precious  fragment of our Saviour's cross.\"    The countess beckoned to a page, and after a few minutes the boy  brought her on a velvet cushion a little black ebony box set with  precious stones with a woman's name written on it. The knight uttered  a cry of joyful surprise, for he recognised the jewel at once.    \"Entreat the Holy Patron of Knighthood to pardon you,\" said the  countess with a smile. \"A strange knight brought this to the steward a  few days ago, and before I had time to send for him, he had  disappeared.\"    \"It was St. George himself!\" whispered the knight, crossing himself  piously, \"which proves that the fragment really belonged to the Holy  Cross.\"    Then he bent his knee before his charming mistress who, with a deep  blush on her cheeks, gave the man she had long but secretly loved  love's first kiss.           *       *       *       *       *    A happy marriage was speedily celebrated in Heimburg. The Knight of  Ravensberg then called his castle Spanheim (Span being the German word  for chip) in memory of the precious little relic. This name was later  on corrupted into Sponheim.          ASSMANNSHAUSEN    St. Clement's Chapel      [Illustration: Gefangener Raubritter--Nach dem Gemaelde von Konrad  Weigand (zur Sage: Die Clemenskapelle)]    There is a very melancholy legend connected with the foundation of St.  Clement's church, which was built on the banks of the Rhine and which,  not long since, was rebuilt and renovated by the generosity of the  present great lady of Rheinstein Castle.

The way into my parlor is up a winding stair;    And I have many curious things to show you when you're there.\"      \"Oh, no, no,\" said the little fly; \"to ask me is in vain;    For who goes up your winding stair can ne'er come down again.\"      \"I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;    Will you rest upon my little bed?\" said the spider to the fly.    \"There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin;    And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in!\"    \"Oh, no, no,\" said the little fly; \"for I've often heard it said,    They never, never wake again, who sleep upon your bed!\"      Said the cunning spider to the fly,--    \"Dear friend, what can I do    To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?\"      \"I thank you, gentle sir,\" she said, \"for what you're pleased to say,    And bidding you good-morning now, I'll call another day.\"      The spider turned him round about, and went into his den,    For well he knew the silly fly would soon come back again;    So he wove a subtle web in a little corner sly,    And set his table ready, to dine upon the fly.    Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,--    \"Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with the pearl and silver wing;      Your robes are green and purple, there's a crest upon your head!    Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!\"      Alas! alas! how very soon this silly little fly,    Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by.    With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,    Thinking only of her brilliant eyes, her green and purple hue,--    Thinking only of her crested head--poor foolish thing! At last,    Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast!    He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den,    Within his little parlor,--but she ne'er came out again!      And now, dear little children, who may this story read,    To idle, silly, flattering words, I pray you ne'er give heed;    Unto an evil counsellor close heart and ear and eye,    And take a lesson from this tale of the Spider and the Fly.

There once were two cats of Kilkenny,    Each thought there was one cat too many,    So they fought and they fit,    And they scratched and they bit,    Till, excepting their nails    And the tips of their tails,    Instead of two cats, there weren't any.        1 This pig went to the barn;    2 This ate all the corn;    3 This said he would tell;    4 This said he wasn't well;    5 This went week, week, week, over the door sill.          There was a little man,      And he had a little gun,    And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;      He went to the brook      And saw a little duck,    And he shot it through the head, head, head.        He carried it home      To his old wife Joan,    And bid a fire for to make, make, make,      To roast the little duck,      He had shot in the brook,    And he'd go and fetch her the drake, drake, drake.

I had a little husband, no bigger than my thumb;    I put him in a pint-pot, and there I bid him drum.
