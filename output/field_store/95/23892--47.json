And while her hands were busy, her  mother instructed her in the laws regulating a pious Jewish household  and in the conduct proper for a Jewish wife; for, of course, every  girl hoped to be a wife. A girl was born for no other purpose.    How soon it came, the pious burden of wifehood! One day the girl is  playing forfeits with her laughing friends, the next day she is missed  from the circle. She has been summoned to a conference with the  shadchan (marriage broker), who has been for months past advertising  her housewifely talents, her piety, her good looks, and her marriage  portion, among families with marriageable sons. Her parents are  pleased with the son-in-law proposed by the shadchan, and now, at the  last, the girl is brought in, to be examined and appraised by the  prospective parents-in-law. If the negotiations go off smoothly, the  marriage contract is written, presents are exchanged between the  engaged couple, through their respective parents, and all that is left  the girl of her maidenhood is a period of busy preparation for the  wedding.       [Illustration: HEDER (HEBREW SCHOOL) FOR BOYS IN POLOTZK]    If the girl is well-to-do, it is a happy interval, spent in visits to  the drapers and tailors, in collecting linens and featherbeds and  vessels of copper and brass. The former playmates come to inspect the  trousseau, enviously fingering the silks and velvets of the  bride-elect. The happy heroine tries on frocks and mantles before her  glass, blushing at references to the wedding day; and to the question,  \"How do you like the bridegroom?\" she replies, \"How should I know?  There was such a crowd at the betrothal that I didn't see him.\"    Marriage was a sacrament with us Jews in the Pale. To rear a family of  children was to serve God. Every Jewish man and woman had a part in  the fulfilment of the ancient promise given to Jacob that his seed  should be abundantly scattered over the earth. Parenthood, therefore,  was the great career. But while men, in addition to begetting, might  busy themselves with the study of the Law, woman's only work was  motherhood. To be left an old maid became, accordingly, the greatest  misfortune that could threaten a girl; and to ward off that calamity  the girl and her family, to the most distant relatives, would strain  every nerve, whether by contributing to her dowry, or hiding her  defects from the marriage broker, or praying and fasting that God  might send her a husband.    Not only must all the children of a family be mated, but they must  marry in the order of their ages. A younger daughter must on no  account marry before an elder. A houseful of daughters might be held  up because the eldest failed to find favor in the eyes of prospective  mothers-in-law; not one of the others could marry till the eldest was  disposed of.    A cousin of mine was guilty of the disloyalty of wishing to marry  before her elder sister, who was unfortunate enough to be rejected by  one mother-in-law after another. My uncle feared that the younger  daughter, who was of a firm and masterful nature, might carry out her  plans, thereby disgracing her unhappy sister. Accordingly he hastened  to conclude an alliance with a family far beneath him, and the girl  was hastily married to a boy of whom little was known beyond the fact  that he was inclined to consumption.    The consumptive tendency was no such horror, in an age when  superstition was more in vogue than science. For one patient that went  to a physician in Polotzk, there were ten who called in unlicensed  practitioners and miracle workers. If my mother had an obstinate  toothache that honored household remedies failed to relieve, she went  to Dvoshe, the pious woman, who cured by means of a flint and steel,  and a secret prayer pronounced as the sparks flew up. During an  epidemic of scarlet fever, we protected ourselves by wearing a piece  of red woolen tape around the neck. Pepper and salt tied in a corner  of the pocket was effective in warding off the evil eye. There were  lucky signs, lucky dreams, spirits, and hobgoblins, a grisly  collection, gathered by our wandering ancestors from the demonologies  of Asia and Europe.    Antiquated as our popular follies was the organization of our small  society. It was a caste system with social levels sharply marked off,  and families united by clannish ties. The rich looked down on the  poor, the merchants looked down on the artisans, and within the ranks  of the artisans higher and lower grades were distinguished. A  shoemaker's daughter could not hope to marry the son of a shopkeeper,  unless she brought an extra large dowry; and she had to make up her  mind to be snubbed by the sisters-in-law and cousins-in-law all her  life.    One qualification only could raise a man above his social level, and  that was scholarship. A boy born in the gutter need not despair of  entering the houses of the rich, if he had a good mind and a great  appetite for sacred learning. A poor scholar would be preferred in the  marriage market to a rich ignoramus. In the phrase of our  grandmothers, a boy stuffed with learning was worth more than a girl  stuffed with bank notes.    Simple piety unsupported by learning had a parallel value in the eyes  of good families. This was especially true among the Hasidim, the sect  of enthusiasts who set religious exaltation above rabbinical lore.  Ecstasy in prayer and fantastic merriment on days of religious  rejoicing, raised a Hasid to a hero among his kind. My father's  grandfather, who knew of Hebrew only enough to teach beginners, was  famous through a good part of the Pale for his holy life. Israel  Kimanyer he was called, from the village of Kimanye where he lived;  and people were proud to establish even the most distant relationship  with him. Israel was poor to the verge of beggary, but he prayed more  than other people, never failed in the slightest observance enjoined  on Jews, shared his last crust with every chance beggar, and sat up  nights to commune with God. His family connections included country  peddlers, starving artisans, and ne'er-do-wells; but Israel was a  zaddik--a man of piety--and the fame of his good life redeemed the  whole wretched clan. When his grandson, my father, came to marry, he  boasted his direct descent from Israel Kimanyer, and picked his bride  from the best families.    The little house may still be standing which the pious Jews of Kimanye  and the neighboring villages built for my great-grandfather, close on  a century ago. He was too poor to build his own house, so the good  people who loved him, and who were almost as poor as he, collected a  few rubles among themselves, and bought a site, and built the house.  Built, let it be known, with their own hands; for they were too poor  to hire workmen. They carried the beams and boards on their shoulders,  singing and dancing on the way, as they sang and danced at the  presentation of a scroll to the synagogue. They hauled and sawed and  hammered, till the last nail was driven home; and when they conducted  the holy man to his new abode, the rejoicing was greater than at the  crowning of a czar.    That little cabin was fit to be preserved as the monument to a  species of idealism that has rarely been known outside the Pale. What  was the ultimate source of the pious enthusiasm that built my  great-grandfather's house? What was the substance behind the show of  the Judaism of the Pale? Stripped of its grotesque mask of forms,  rites, and mediaeval superstitions, the religion of these fanatics was  simply the belief that God was, had been, and ever would be, and that  they, the children of Jacob, were His chosen messengers to carry His  Law to all the nations. Beneath the mountainous volumes of the  Talmudists and commentators, the Mosaic tablets remained intact. Out  of the mazes of the Cabala the pure doctrine of ancient Judaism found  its way to the hearts of the faithful. Sects and schools might rise  and fall, deafening the ears of the simple with the clamor of their  disputes, still the Jew, retiring within his own soul, heard the  voice of the God of Abraham. Prophets, messiahs, miracle workers  might have their day, still the Jew was conscious that between  himself and God no go-between was needed; that he, as well as every  one of his million brothers, had his portion of God's work to do. And  this close relation to God was the source of the strength that  sustained the Jew through all the trials of his life in the Pale.  Consciously or unconsciously, the Jew identified himself with the  cause of righteousness on earth; and hence the heroism with which he  met the battalions of tyrants.    No empty forms could have impressed the unborn children of the Pale so  deeply that they were prepared for willing martyrdom almost as soon as  they were weaned from their mother's breast. The flame of the burning  bush that had dazzled Moses still lighted the gloomy prison of the  Pale. Behind the mummeries, ceremonials, and symbolic accessories, the  object of the Jew's adoration was the face of God.    This has been many times proved by those who escaped from the Pale,  and, excited by sudden freedom, thought to rid themselves, by one  impatient effort, of every strand of their ancient bonds. Eager to be  merged in the better world in which they found themselves, the escaped  prisoners determined on a change of mind, a change of heart, a change  of manner. They rejoiced in their transformation, thinking that every  mark of their former slavery was obliterated. And then, one day,  caught in the vise of some crucial test, the Jew fixed his alarmed  gaze on his inmost soul, and found there the image of his father's  God.           *       *       *       *       *    Merrily played the fiddlers at the wedding of my father, who was the  grandson of Israel Kimanyer of sainted memory. The most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#8)"],[1,"St. Augustine was: he  was the ambassador of Europe to Britain.    William asserted that the Confessor, in the course of that connection  which followed naturally from his Norman education, had promised the  English crown to the holder of the Norman dukedom. Whether he did or not  we shall probably never know: it is not intrinsically impossible or even  improbable. To blame the promise as unpatriotic, even if it was given,  is to read duties defined at a much later date into the first feudal  chaos; to make such blame positive and personal is like expecting the  Ancient Britons to sing \"Rule Britannia.\" William further clinched his  case by declaring that Harold, the principal Saxon noble and the most  probable Saxon claimant, had, while enjoying the Duke's hospitality  after a shipwreck, sworn upon sacred relics not to dispute the Duke's  claim. About this episode also we must agree that we do not know; yet we  shall be quite out of touch with the time if we say that we do not care.  The element of sacrilege in the alleged perjury of Harold probably  affected the Pope when he blessed a banner for William's army; but it  did not affect the Pope much more than it would have affected the  people; and Harold's people quite as much as William's. Harold's people  presumably denied the fact; and their denial is probably the motive of  the very marked and almost eager emphasis with which the Bayeux Tapestry  asserts and reasserts the reality of the personal betrayal. There is  here a rather arresting fact to be noted. A great part of this  celebrated pictorial record is not concerned at all with the well-known  historical events which we have only to note rapidly here. It does,  indeed, dwell a little on the death of Edward; it depicts the  difficulties of William's enterprise in the felling of forests for  shipbuilding, in the crossing of the Channel, and especially in the  charge up the hill at Hastings, in which full justice is done to the  destructive resistance of Harold's army. But it was really after Duke  William had disembarked and defeated Harold on the Sussex coast, that he  did what is historically worthy to be called the Conquest. It is not  until these later operations that we have the note of the new and  scientific militarism from the Continent. Instead of marching upon  London he marched round it; and crossing the Thames at Wallingford cut  off the city from the rest of the country and compelled its surrender.  He had himself elected king with all the forms that would have  accompanied a peaceful succession to the Confessor, and after a brief  return to Normandy took up the work of war again to bring all England  under his crown. Marching through the snow, he laid waste the northern  counties, seized Chester, and made rather than won a kingdom. These  things are the foundations of historical England; but of these things  the pictures woven in honour of his house tell us nothing. The Bayeux  Tapestry may almost be said to stop before the Norman Conquest. But it  tells in great detail the tale of some trivial raid into Brittany solely  that Harold and William may appear as brothers in arms; and especially  that William may be depicted in the very act of giving arms to Harold.  And here again there is much more significance than a modern reader may  fancy, in its bearing upon the new birth of that time and the ancient  symbolism of arms. I have said that Duke William was a vassal of the  King of France; and that phrase in its use and abuse is the key to the  secular side of this epoch. William was indeed a most mutinous vassal,  and a vein of such mutiny runs through his family fortunes: his sons  Rufus and Henry I. disturbed him with internal ambitions antagonistic to  his own. But it would be a blunder to allow such personal broils to  obscure the system, which had indeed existed here before the Conquest,  which clarified and confirmed it. That system we call Feudalism.    That Feudalism was the main mark of the Middle Ages is a commonplace of  fashionable information; but it is of the sort that seeks the past  rather in Wardour Street than Watling Street. For that matter, the very  term \"mediaeval\" is used for almost anything from Early English to Early  Victorian. An eminent Socialist applied it to our armaments, which is  like applying it to our aeroplanes. Similarly the just description of  Feudalism, and of how far it was a part and how far rather an impediment  in the main mediaeval movement, is confused by current debates about  quite modern things--especially that modern thing, the English  squirearchy. Feudalism was very nearly the opposite of squirearchy. For  it is the whole point of the squire that his ownership is absolute and  is pacific. And it is the very definition of Feudalism that it was a  tenure, and a tenure by military service. Men paid their rent in steel  instead of gold, in spears and arrows against the enemies of their  landlord. But even these landlords were not landlords in the modern  sense; every one was practically as well as theoretically a tenant of  the King; and even he often fell into a feudal inferiority to a Pope or  an Emperor. To call it mere tenure by soldiering may seem a  simplification; but indeed it is precisely here that it was not so  simple as it seems. It is precisely a certain knot or enigma in the  nature of Feudalism which makes half the struggle of European history,  but especially English history.    There was a certain unique type of state and culture which we call  mediaeval, for want of a better word, which we see in the Gothic or the  great Schoolmen. This thing in itself was above all things logical. Its  very cult of authority was a thing of reason, as all men who can reason  themselves instantly recognize, even if, like Huxley, they deny its  premises or dislike its fruits. Being logical, it was very exact about  who had the authority. Now Feudalism was not quite logical, and was  never quite exact about who had the authority. Feudalism already  flourished before the mediaeval renascence began. It was, if not the  forest the mediaevals had to clear, at least the rude timber with which  they had to build. Feudalism was a fighting growth of the Dark Ages  before the Middle Ages; the age of barbarians resisted by  semi-barbarians. I do not say this in disparagement of it. Feudalism was  mostly a very human thing; the nearest contemporary name for it was  homage, a word which almost means humanity. On the other hand, mediaeval  logic, never quite reconciled to it, could become in its extremes  inhuman. It was often mere prejudice that protected men, and pure reason  that burned them. The feudal units grew through the lively localism of  the Dark Ages, when hills without roads shut in a valley like a  garrison. Patriotism had to be parochial; for men had no country, but  only a countryside. In such cases the lord grew larger than the king;  but it bred not only a local lordship but a kind of local liberty. And  it would be very inadvisable to ignore the freer element in Feudalism in  English history. For it is the one kind of freedom that the English have  had and held.    The knot in the system was something like this. In theory the King owned  everything, like an earthly providence; and that made for despotism and  \"divine right,\" which meant in substance a natural authority. In one  aspect the King was simply the one lord anointed by the Church, that is  recognized by the ethics of the age. But while there was more royalty in  theory, there could be more rebellion in practice. Fighting was much  more equal than in our age of munitions, and the various groups could  arm almost instantly with bows from the forest or spears from the smith.  Where men are military there is no militarism. But it is more vital that  while the kingdom was in this sense one territorial army, the regiments  of it were also kingdoms. The sub-units were also sub-loyalties. Hence  the loyalist to his lord might be a rebel to his king; or the king be a  demagogue delivering him from the lord. This tangle is responsible for  the tragic passions about betrayal, as in the case of William and  Harold; the alleged traitor who is always found to be recurrent, yet  always felt to be exceptional. To break the tie was at once easy and  terrible. Treason in the sense of rebellion was then really felt as  treason in the sense of treachery, since it was desertion on a perpetual  battlefield. Now, there was even more of this civil war in English than  in other history, and the more local and less logical energy on the  whole prevailed. Whether there was something in those island  idiosyncracies, shapeless as sea-mists, with which this story began, or  whether the Roman imprint had really been lighter than in Gaul, the  feudal undergrowth prevented even a full attempt to build the _Civitas  Dei_, or ideal mediaeval state. What emerged was a compromise, which men  long afterwards amused themselves by calling a constitution.    There are paradoxes permissible for the redressing of a bad balance in  criticism, and which may safely even be emphasized so long as they are  not isolated. One of these I have called at the beginning of this  chapter the strength of the weak kings. And there is a complement of it,  even in this crisis of the Norman mastery, which might well be called  the weakness of the strong kings. William of Normandy succeeded  immediately, he did not quite succeed ultimately; there was in his huge  success a secret of failure that only bore fruit long after his death.  It was certainly his single aim to simplify England into a popular  autocracy, like that growing up in France; with that aim he scattered  the feudal holdings in scraps, demanded a direct vow from the  sub-vassals to himself, and used any tool against the barony, from the  highest culture of the foreign ecclesiastics to the rudest relics of  Saxon custom. But the very parallel of France makes the paradox "]]]
