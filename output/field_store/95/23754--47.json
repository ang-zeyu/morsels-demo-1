Most oxidising  agents also act as de-sulphurisers.    _The de-oxidising agents_ most in use are the following:--    ~Charcoal.~--Powdered wood charcoal; it contains more or less  hygroscopic moisture and about 3 or 4 per cent. of ash. The rest may be  considered carbon. Carbon heated with metallic oxides takes the oxygen;  at low temperatures it forms carbon dioxide, and at higher ones, carbon  monoxide. Other conditions besides that of temperature have an influence  in producing these results; and as the quantity of charcoal required to  complete a definite reaction varies with these, it should be calculated  from the results of immediate experience rather than from theoretical  considerations.    ~Flour.~--Ordinary wheat flour is convenient in use. On being heated it  gives off inflammable gases which have a certain reducing effect, and a  residue of finely divided carbon is left. It is likely to vary in the  quantity of moisture it contains. Two parts of flour should be used  where one part of charcoal would be otherwise required.    ~Tartar.~--This is crude hydric potassic tartrate; the purified salt,  cream of tartar, may be used. On being heated it gives off inflammable  gases, and leaves a residue formed of potassic carbonate mixed with  finely divided carbon. Five parts of tartar should be used in the place  of one of charcoal.    ~Anthracite~ or ~Culm~ is a kind of coal containing 90 per cent. or more  of carbon. It gives off no inflammable gas. It is denser, and takes  longer in burning, than charcoal. Its reducing effect is little inferior  to that of charcoal. Almost any organic substance can be used as a  reducing agent, but it is well not to select one which melts, swells up,  or gives off much water and gas when heated in the furnace.    ~Potassic Cyanide~ is an easily fusible and somewhat volatile salt,  which, when fused, readily removes oxygen and sulphur from metallic  compounds, and forms potassic cyanate or sulphocyanate as the case may  be. Commercial samples vary much in purity; some contain less than 50  per cent. of the salt. For assaying, only the better qualities should be  used.    ~Iron~ is a de-sulphurising rather than a de-oxidising agent. Iron is  used in the form of rods, 1/2-inch in diameter, or of nails, or of hoop  iron. In the last case it should be thin enough to be bent without  difficulty. Wrought iron crucibles are very useful in the processes  required for making galena assays.    _The chief oxidising agents (which are also de-sulphurisers)_ are the  following:--    ~Nitre~, or Potassic Nitrate.--This salt fuses very easily to a watery  liquid. It oxidises most combustible substances with deflagration, and  thereby converts sulphides into sulphates, arsenides into arsenates, and  most metals into oxides. In the presence of strong bases, such as soda,  the whole of the sulphur is fully oxidised; but in many cases some  arsenic is apt to escape, and to give rise to a peculiar garlic-like  odour. The sulphates of soda and potash are thus formed, and float as a  watery liquid on the surface of the slag.    ~Red lead~ is an oxide of lead. About one-quarter of its oxygen is very  loosely held, and, hence, is available for oxidising purposes, without  any separation of metallic lead. The rest of the oxygen is also  available; but for each part of oxygen given off, about 13 parts of  metallic lead are deposited. In silver assays this power of readily  giving up oxygen is made use of. The residual oxide (litharge) acts as a  flux.    ~Hot air~ is the oxidising agent in roasting operations. The sulphur and  arsenic of such minerals as mispickel and pyrites are oxidised by the  hot air and pass off as sulphur dioxide and \"white arsenic.\" The metals  generally remain in the form of oxide, mixed with more or less sulphate  and arsenate. The residue may remain as a powdery substance (a calx), in  which case the process of roasting is termed calcination; or it may be a  pasty mass or liquid. In the calcination of somewhat fusible minerals,  the roasting should be done at a low temperature to avoid clotting;  arsenic and sulphur being with difficulty burnt off from the clotted  mineral. A low temperature, however, favours the formation of sulphates;  and these (if not removed) would reappear in a subsequent reduction as  sulphides. These sulphates may be decomposed by a higher temperature  towards the end of the operation; their removal is rendered more certain  by rubbing up the calx with some culm and re-roasting, or by strongly  heating the calx after the addition of solid ammonic carbonate. In  roasting operations, as large a surface of the substance as possible  should be exposed to the air. If done in a crucible, the crucible should  be of the Cornish type, short and open, not long and narrow. For  calcinations, _roasting dishes_ are useful: these are broad and shallow,  not unlike saucers, but unglazed. In those cases in which the products  of the roasting are liquid at the temperature used, a _scorifier_ (fig.  38) is suitable if it is desired to keep the liquid; but if the liquid  is best drained off as quickly as it is formed, a _cupel_ (fig. 5)  should be used.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    A scorifier is essentially a roasting dish sufficiently thick to resist,  for a time, the corrosive action of the fused metallic oxides it is to  contain. The essential property of a cupel is, that it is sufficiently  porous to allow the fused oxide to drain into it as fast as it is  formed. It should be large enough to absorb the whole of the liquid; and  of course must be made of a material upon which the liquid has no  corrosive action. Cupels do not bear transport well; hence the assayer  generally has to make them, or to supervise their making. A quantity of  bone ash is carefully mixed with water so that no lumps are formed, and  the mixture is then worked up by rubbing between the hands. The bone ash  is sufficiently wet when its cohesion is such that it can be pressed  into a lump, and yet be easily crumbled into powder. Cupel moulds should  be purchased. They are generally made of turned iron or brass. They  consist of three parts (1) a hollow cylinder; (2) a disc of metal; and  (3) a piston for compressing the bone ash and shaping the top of the  cupel. The disc forms a false bottom for the cylinder. This is put in  its place, and the cylinder filled (or nearly so) with the moistened  bone ash. The bone ash is then pressed into shape with the piston, and  the cupel finished with the help of three or four smart blows from a  mallet. Before removing the piston, turn it half-way round upon its axis  so as to loosen and smooth the face of the cupel. The cupel is got out  by pressing up the disc of metal forming the false bottom; the removal  is more easily effected if the mould is somewhat conical, instead of  cylindrical, in form. The cupels are put in a warm place to dry for two  or three days. A conveniently sized cupel is 1-1/4 inches in diameter  and about 3/4 inch high. The cavity of the cupel is about 1/4 inch deep,  and something of the shape shown in fig. 5.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    There are two kinds of furnaces required, the \"wind\" and \"muffle\"  furnaces. These are built of brick, fire-brick, of course, being used  for the lining. They are connected with a chimney that will provide a  good draught. Figure 6 shows a section of the wind furnace, fig. 7 a  section of the muffle furnace, and fig. 8 a general view of a group  comprising a muffle and two wind furnaces suitable for general work.  When in operation, the furnaces are covered with iron-bound tiles. The  opening under the door of the muffle is closed with a loosely fitting  brick. The floor of the muffle is protected with a layer of bone-ash,  which absorbs any oxide of lead that may be accidentally spilt. The fire  bars should be easily removable.    Few tools are wanted; the most important are some cast-iron moulds,  tongs (fig. 9), stirrers for calcining (fig. 10), and light tongs of a  special form for handling scorifiers and cupels (_see_ SILVER).    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    The coke used should be of good quality; the formation of a fused ash  (clinker), in any quantity, causes ceaseless trouble, and requires  frequent removal. The coke should be broken into lumps of a uniform size  (about 2 in. across) before being brought into the office. The furnace  should be well packed by stirring, raising the coke and not ramming it,  and it should be uniformly heated, not hot below and cold above. In  lighting a furnace, a start is made with wood and charcoal, this readily  ignites and sets fire to the coke, which of itself does not kindle  easily.    In commencing work, add (if necessary) fresh coke, and mix well; make  hollows, and into these put old crucibles; pack around with coke, so  that the surface shall be concave, sloping upwards from the mouths of  the crucibles to the sides of the furnace; close the furnace, and, when  uniformly heated, substitute for the empty crucibles those which contain  the assays. It is rarely advisable to have a very hot fire at first,  because with a gradual heat the gases and steam quietly escape through  the unfused mass, while with too strong a heat these might make some of  the matter in the crucible overflow. Moreover, if the heat should be too  strong at first, the flux might melt and run to the bottom of the  crucible, leaving the quartz, &c., as a pasty mass above; with a gentler  heat combination is completed, and the subsequent fiercer heat simply  melts the fusible compound into homogeneous slag.    The fused material may be left in the crucible and separated from it by  breaking when cold. It is generally more convenient to pour it into  cast-iron moulds. These moulds should be dry and smooth. They act best  when warmed and oiled or black-leaded.    Air"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#8)"],[1,"referred to God. The other is the formal aspect of the object, for it  is the medium on account of which we assent to such and such a point  of faith; and thus an act of faith is \"to believe God,\" since, as  stated above (ibid.) the formal object of faith is the First Truth,  to Which man gives his adhesion, so as to assent for Its sake to  whatever he believes.    Thirdly, if the object of faith be considered in so far as the  intellect is moved by the will, an act of faith is \"to believe in  God.\" For the First Truth is referred to the will, through having the  aspect of an end.    Reply Obj. 1: These three do not denote different acts of faith, but  one and the same act having different relations to the object of  faith.    This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.    Reply Obj. 3: Unbelievers cannot be said \"to believe in a God\" as  we understand it in relation to the act of faith. For they do not  believe that God exists under the conditions that faith determines;  hence they do not truly imply believe in a God, since, as the  Philosopher observes (Metaph. ix, text. 22) \"to know simple things  defectively is not to know them at all.\"    Reply Obj. 4: As stated above (I-II, Q. 9, A. 1) the will moves the  intellect and the other powers of the soul to the end: and in this  respect an act of faith is \"to believe in God.\"  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 3]    Whether It Is Necessary for Salvation to Believe Anything Above the  Natural Reason?    Objection 1: It would seem unnecessary for salvation to believe  anything above the natural reason. For the salvation and perfection of  a thing seem to be sufficiently insured by its natural endowments. Now  matters of faith, surpass man's natural reason, since they are things  unseen as stated above (Q. 1, A. 4). Therefore to believe seems  unnecessary for salvation.    Obj. 2: Further, it is dangerous for man to assent to matters,  wherein he cannot judge whether that which is proposed to him be true  or false, according to Job 12:11: \"Doth not the ear discern words?\"  Now a man cannot form a judgment of this kind in matters of faith,  since he cannot trace them back to first principles, by which all our  judgments are guided. Therefore it is dangerous to believe in such  matters. Therefore to believe is not necessary for salvation.    Obj. 3: Further, man's salvation rests on God, according to Ps.  36:39: \"But the salvation of the just is from the Lord.\" Now \"the  invisible things\" of God \"are clearly seen, being understood by the  things that are made; His eternal power also and Divinity,\" according  to Rom. 1:20: and those things which are clearly seen by the  understanding are not an object of belief. Therefore it is not  necessary for man's salvation, that he should believe certain things.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Heb. 11:6): \"Without faith it is  impossible to please God.\"    _I answer that,_ Wherever one nature is subordinate to another, we  find that two things concur towards the perfection of the lower  nature, one of which is in respect of that nature's proper movement,  while the other is in respect of the movement of the higher nature.  Thus water by its proper movement moves towards the centre (of the  earth), while according to the movement of the moon, it moves round  the centre by ebb and flow. In like manner the planets have their  proper movements from west to east, while in accordance with the  movement of the first heaven, they have a movement from east to west.  Now the created rational nature alone is immediately subordinate to  God, since other creatures do not attain to the universal, but only  to something particular, while they partake of the Divine goodness  either in _being_ only, as inanimate things, or also in _living,_ and  in _knowing singulars,_ as plants and animals; whereas the rational  nature, in as much as it apprehends the universal notion of good and  being, is immediately related to the universal principle of being.    Consequently the perfection of the rational creature consists not  only in what belongs to it in respect of its nature, but also in that  which it acquires through a supernatural participation of Divine  goodness. Hence it was said above (I-II, Q. 3, A. 8) that man's  ultimate happiness consists in a supernatural vision of God: to which  vision man cannot attain unless he be taught by God, according to  John 6:45: \"Every one that hath heard of the Father and hath learned  cometh to Me.\" Now man acquires a share of this learning, not indeed  all at once, but by little and little, according to the mode of his  nature: and every one who learns thus must needs believe, in order  that he may acquire science in a perfect degree; thus also the  Philosopher remarks (De Soph. Elench. i, 2) that \"it behooves a  learner to believe.\"    Hence in order that a man arrive at the perfect vision of heavenly  happiness, he must first of all believe God, as a disciple believes  the master who is teaching him.    Reply Obj. 1: Since man's nature is dependent on a higher nature,  natural knowledge does not suffice for its perfection, and some  supernatural knowledge is necessary, as stated above.    Reply Obj. 2: Just as man assents to first principles, by the natural  light of his intellect, so does a virtuous man, by the habit of  virtue, judge aright of things concerning that virtue; and in this  way, by the light of faith which God bestows on him, a man assents to  matters of faith and not to those which are against faith.  Consequently \"there is no\" danger or \"condemnation to them that are  in Christ Jesus,\" and whom He has enlightened by faith.    Reply Obj. 3: In many respects faith perceives the invisible things  of God in a higher way than natural reason does in proceeding to God  from His creatures. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 3:25): \"Many things  are shown to thee above the understandings of man.\"  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 4]    Whether It Is Necessary to Believe Those Things Which Can Be Proved  by Natural Reason?    Objection 1: It would seem unnecessary to believe those things which  can be proved by natural reason. For nothing is superfluous in God's  works, much less even than in the works of nature. Now it is  superfluous to employ other means, where one already suffices.  Therefore it would be superfluous to receive by faith, things that  can be known by natural reason.    Obj. 2: Further, those things must be believed, which are the object  of faith. Now science and faith are not about the same object, as  stated above (Q. 1, AA. 4, 5). Since therefore all things that can be  known by natural reason are an object of science, it seems that there  is no need to believe what can be proved by natural reason.    Obj. 3: Further, all things knowable scientifically [*Science is  certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its  demonstration] would seem to come under one head: so that if some of  them are proposed to man as objects of faith, in like manner the  others should also be believed. But this is not true. Therefore it is  not necessary to believe those things which can be proved by natural  reason.    _On the contrary,_ It is necessary to believe that God is one and  incorporeal: which things philosophers prove by natural reason.    _I answer that,_ It is necessary for man to accept by faith not only  things which are above reason, but also those which can be known by  reason: and this for three motives. First, in order that man may  arrive more quickly at the knowledge of Divine truth. Because the  science to whose province it belongs to prove the existence of God,  is the last of all to offer itself to human research, since it  presupposes many other sciences: so that it would not by until late  in life that man would arrive at the knowledge of God. The second  reason is, in order that the knowledge of God may be more general.  For many are unable to make progress in the study of science, either  through dullness of mind, or through having a number of occupations,  and temporal needs, or even through laziness in learning, all of whom  would be altogether deprived of the knowledge of God, unless Divine  things were brought to their knowledge under the guise of faith. The  third reason is for the sake of certitude. For human reason is very  deficient in things concerning God. A sign of this is that  philosophers in their researches, by natural investigation, into  human affairs, have fallen into many errors, and have disagreed among  themselves. And consequently, in order that men might have knowledge  of God, free of doubt and uncertainty, it was necessary for Divine  matters to be delivered to them by way of faith, being told to them,  as it were, by God Himself Who cannot lie.    Reply Obj. 1: The researches of natural reason do not suffice mankind  for the knowledge of Divine matters, even of those that can be proved  by reason: and so it is not superfluous if these others be believed.    Reply Obj. 2: Science and faith cannot be in the same subject and  about the same object: but what is an object of science for one, can  be an object of faith for another, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 5).    Reply Obj. 3: Although all things that can be known by science are  of one common scientific aspect, they do not all alike lead man to  beatitude: hence they are not all equally proposed to our belief.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 5]    Whether Man Is Bound to Believe Anything Explicitly?    Objection 1: It would seem that man is not bound to believe anything  explicitly. For no man is bound to do what is not in his power. Now it  is not in man's power to believe a thing explicitly, for it is written  (Rom. 10:14, 15): \"How shall they believe Him, of whom they have not  heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they  preach unless they be sent?\" Therefore man is"]]]
