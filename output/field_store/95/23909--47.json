We could see  their prolonged stand was not without its effect on the Westfield  bowlers.  Their bowling became less and less steady, and their style  seemed to lose its precision, as ball after ball fell hopelessly off  those obstinate bats.  This was evidently just what Steel wanted, and we  could tell by his frequent \"Played, sir!\" how thoroughly he approved of  the steady discipline of his men.  After a time the very monotony of the  game seemed to excite the spectators, who answered each neat \"block\"  with a cheer, which showed they, too, could appreciate the tactics of  our captain.    It was getting desperate for Westfield, and humiliating too, when one of  their bowlers happened to change his style.  Instead of the slashing  round-arm balls which he had hitherto sent in, he suddenly and without  warning put in an underhand lob--an easy, slow, tempting ball,  apparently bound to rise exactly on the player's bat.    Our man fell into the snare.  I could hear Steel, who was near me,  groan, as we watched him lift the bat which had till now remained so  well under control, and stepping forward prepare for a terrific \"slog.\"  Alas! the deceitful ball never rose at all, but pitching quietly a foot  before the crease, shot forward along the ground, and found its way at  last to the wicket, amid the tremendous shouts of all the crowd.    A parting being thus made between the two steady partners, the survivor,  as is so often the case, did not long remain behind his companion, and  when Steel went in, three wickets had already fallen with only fifteen  runs.    Will our captain save us from defeat?  See him stand coolly at the  wicket--how sure of himself he seems!--how indifferent to that imposing  combination of bowlers and fielders which surround him!  He takes his  time to get comfortably settled at his wicket, and kneels down to  tighten a shoestring, as if nobody was waiting for him.  Then pulling  down the peak of his cap to shade his eyes from the sun, he leisurely  turns his face to the bowler, and announces himself ready for the worst  that desperate character can do to him.    We watched breathlessly the result of his first over, and with an  excitement strangely in contrast with the indifferent and apparently  careless demeanour of the batsman himself.  It was soon apparent,  however, that we might dismiss all anxiety from our minds as to his  safety, for he set briskly to work, punishing every ball that came to  him, yet never giving a single chance.  I have rarely seen such good  \"all-round play.\"  Unlike the Westfield captain, who was strong only on  the leg side of the wicket, he was thoroughly at home from whatever side  the attack was delivered.  Some balls he hit to \"leg,\" and some he cut  with terrific force past \"cover-point.\"  No ball came amiss to him; he  was up to \"twisters,\" and \"lobs,\" and \"thunderbolts,\" and walked into  them all with faultless dexterity.    Up went our score.  Twenty grew to forty, and forty to fifty.  It was  all a matter of time now.  If the five remaining men still to go in  could together make a stand long enough to enable him to overtake the  enemy's score, he would assuredly do it, unless some unforeseen accident  prevented it.  Of these five I was next in order; nor was it long before  my turn arrived, and I found myself sallying forth to join my captain at  the wickets.  Remembering the poor figure I had cut in the first  innings, I was not very sanguine of distinguishing myself on this  occasion.  Still, there was something in being opposite Steel which gave  me confidence, and relieved me of the nervous sensations which marked my  late _debut_.    The first ball or two after my arrival fell to the lot of Steel, who  sent them flying promptly, and gave me some running to do in  consequence.  This helped still more to make me comfortable, so that  when at last my turn came to be bowled at, I experienced none of the  desolate feeling which had rendered my former brief innings so unhappy.    I manage to block the first ball, and the second also.  Then comes a  third, under which I contrive to get my bat and send it flying.    \"Come!\" shouts Steel, and I run.    \"Another!\" he cries; and I run again, and am safe back before the ball  returns to the wicket-keeper's hands.    Positively I had scored two!  I felt as proud as if I had been elected  an M.P.  The next ball went for two more, and I could hear a cheer from  the tent, which made me feel very valiant.  I glanced to the signal-  board; our score was ninety-six, only twenty-seven to win!  Why should  not I be able to hold out until Steel made up the figure, and so defeat  Westfield by four wickets?  At any rate I would try; and I sent my next  ball for a single.    Then it was Steel's turn to bat.  Of course he would send it flying.    Horrors!  He has missed it!  A deafening shout proclaims that his  glorious innings is at an end, and I feel like an orphan as I watch him,  with his bat under his arm, quitting the wicket at which he had put  together sixty-six runs in as fine a style as any player ever did.  It  was good to hear the applause which welcomed him back to the tent.    But what was to become of us?  Here were twenty-six runs to get, and the  four weakest batsmen of our side to play.  However, one can but do his  best.    So I played as carefully as I could, becoming gradually accustomed to  the bowling, and knocking an occasional one or two on to the score.  My  new companion, however, kept me company but a short time, and his  successor shorter still.  This fellow coming in now is our last man.  Will he and I ever be able to stick together till these fifteen runs  which are now required can be made up?    \"Steady, Tom,\" I whisper, as he passes me on the way to his wicket.  He  winks his answer.    It is a responsible thing for us two youngsters, with the whole fate of  the school depending on us.  But we keep cool, and play our very best.  One by one the score runs up.  Ten to win--now eight, seven.  It is  getting exciting.  The crowd hangs eagerly on the result of each ball.  Another two from my companion.  The Westfield fellows look nervously at  the signal-board, as if by watching it they could make our figure grow  less.  But, no!  Another two, from my bat this time, and then a single.  Only two to win!  The next ball gets past my comrade's bat, and skims  within a hair's-breadth of his bails.    \"Steady, now!\" cries Steel, cheerily.  \"Mind what you're at!\"    Steady it is.  The next two balls are blocked dead.    Then my companion makes a single.  Hurrah!  We are equal now.  At any  rate defeat is averted!  Now for victory!  It is my turn to bat; but  this ball is not the sort of one to play tricks with; so with an effort  I keep my bat square, and stop it without hitting.    \"Played, sir!\" cries some one, approvingly, and I feel my self-denial  rewarded.    But the next ball is not so dangerous.  I can see it is a careless one,  which I may safely punish.  Punish it I will; so I step forward, and  catching it on the bound, bang it I know not and care not where.    What shouting! what cheering as we run, one, two, three, four, five  times across the wickets!  The match is ours, with a wicket to spare;  and as we ride back that evening to Parkhurst, and talk and laugh and  exult over that day's victory, we are the happiest eleven fellows,  without exception, that ever rode on the top of an omnibus.        CHAPTER FIVE.    A BOATING ADVENTURE AT PARKHURST.    Once, and once only, did I play truant from Parkhurst, and that  transgression was attended with consequences so tragical that to this  day its memory is as vivid and impressive as if the event I am about to  record had happened only last week, instead of a quarter of a century  ago.    I shall recall it in the hope of deterring my readers from following my  foolish example--or at least of warning them of the terrible results  which may ensue from a thoughtless act of wrong-doing.    I have already mentioned that Parkhurst stood some two or three miles  above the point at which the River Colven flows into the sea.  From the  school-house we could often catch the hum of the waves breaking lazily  along the shore of Colveston Bay; or, if the wind blew hard from the  sea, it carried with it the roar of the breakers on the bar mouth, and  the distant thunder of the surf on the stony beach.    Of course, our walks and rambles constantly took the direction of the  shores of this bay; and though, perhaps, a schoolboy is more readily  impressed with other matters than the beauties of nature, I can remember  even now the once familiar view from Raven Cliff as if my eyes still  rested upon it.    I can see, on a hot summer afternoon, the great curve of that beautiful  bay, bounded at either extremity by headlands, bathed in soft blue haze.  I can see the cliffs and chines and sands basking, like myself, in the  sun.  On my right, the jagged outline of a ruined sea-girt castle stands  out like a sentinel betwixt is land and water.  On my left I can detect  the fishermen's white cottages crouching beneath the crags.  I can see  the long golden strip of strand beyond; and, farther still, across the  wide estuary of the Wraythe, the line of shadowy cliffs that extend like  a rugged wall out to the dim promontory of Shargle Head.    Above all, I can see again the sea, bluer even than the blue sky  overhead; and as it tumbles languidly in from the horizon, fringing the  amphitheatre of the bay with its edge of sparkling white, my ears can  catch the murmur of its solemn music as they heard it in those days long  gone by.    Well I remember, too, the same bay and the same sea; but oh, how  changed!    Far as the eye could reach the great white waves charged towards the  land, one upon another, furious and headlong; below us they thundered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#8)"],[1,"ogether,--the  original of Sindbad's valley-of-diamond story?    57. Well, Humboldt is reduced, by necessities of recent classification,  to call a bird three feet and a half across the wings, a sparrow. I  have no right to laugh at him, for I am just going, myself, to call the  cheerfulest and brightest of birds of the air, an owl. All these  architectural and sepulchral habits, these Egyptian manners of the  sand-martin, digging caves in the sand, and border-trooper's habits of  the chimney swallow, living in round towers instead of open air,  belonging to them as connected with the tribe of the falcons through  the owls! and not only so, but with the mammalia through the bats! A  swallow is an emancipated owl, and a glorified bat; but it never  forgets its fellowship with night.    58. Its _ancient_ fellowship, I had nearly written; so natural is it to  think of these similarly-minded creatures, when the feelings that both  show are evidently useless to one of them, as if the inferior had  changed into the higher. The doctrine of development seems at first to  explain all so pleasantly, that the scream of consent with which it has  been accepted by men of science, and the shriller vociferation of the  public's gregarious applause, scarcely permit you the power of  antagonistic reflection. I must justify to-day, in graver tone than  usual, the terms in which I have hitherto spoken,--it may have been  thought with less than the due respect to my audience,--of the popular  theory.    59. Supposing that the octohedrons of galena, of gold, and of oxide of  iron, were endowed with powers of reproduction, and perished at  appointed dates of dissolution or solution, you would without any doubt  have heard it by this time asserted that the octohedric form, which was  common to all, indicated their descent from a common progenitor; and it  would have been ingeniously explained to you how the angular offspring  of this eight-sided ancestor had developed themselves, by force of  circumstances, into their distinct metallic perfections; how the galena  had become gray and brittle under prolonged subterranean heat, and the  gold yellow and ductile, as it was rolled among the pebbles of  amber-colored streams.    60. By the denial to these structures of any individually reproductive  energy, you are forced to accept the inexplicable (and why expect it to  be otherwise than inexplicable?) fact, of the formation of a series of  bodies having very similar aspects, qualities, and chemical relations  to other substances, which yet have no connection whatever with each  other, and are governed, in their relation with their native rocks, by  entirely arbitrary laws. It has been the pride of modern chemistry to  extricate herself from the vanity of the alchemist, and to admit, with  resignation, the independent, though apparently fraternal, natures, of  silver, of lead, of platinum,--aluminium,--potassium. Hence, a rational  philosophy would deduce the probability that when the arborescence of  dead crystallization rose into the radiation of the living tree, and  sentient plume, the splendor of nature in her more exalted power would  not be restricted to a less variety of design; and the beautiful  caprice in which she gave to the silver its frost and to the opal its  fire, would not be subdued under the slow influences of accident and  time, when she wreathed the swan with snow, and bathed the dove in  iridescence. That the infinitely more exalted powers of life must  exercise more intimate influence over matter than the reckless forces  of cohesion;--and that the loves and hatreds of the now conscious  creatures would modify their forms into parallel beauty and  degradation, we might have anticipated by reason, and we ought long  since to have known by observation. But this law of its spirit over the  substance of the creature involves, necessarily, the indistinctness of  its type, and the existence of inferior and of higher conditions, which  whole eras of heroism and affection--whole eras of misery and  misconduct,--confirm into glory, or confuse into shame. Collecting the  causes of changed form, in lower creatures, by distress, or by  adaptation,--by the disturbance or intensifying of the parental  strength, and the native fortune--the wonder is, not that species  should sometimes be confused, but that the greater number of them  remain so splendidly, so manifestly, so eternally distinct; and that  the vile industries and vicious curiosities of modern science, while  they have robbed the fields of England of a thousand living creatures,  have not created in them one.    61. But even in the paltry knowledge we have obtained, what unanimity  have we?--what security? Suppose any man of ordinary sense, knowing the  value of time, and the relative importance of subjects of thought, and  that the whole scientific world was agog concerning the origin of  species, desired to know first of all--what was meant by a species.    He would naturally look for the definition of species first among the  higher animals, and expect it to be best defined in those which were  best known. And being referred for satisfaction to the 226th page of  the first volume of Mr. Darwin's \"Descent of Man,\" he would find this  passage:--    \"Man has been studied more carefully than any other organic being, and  yet there is the greatest possible diversity among capable judges,  whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as two  (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenbach), six  (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven (Pickering), fifteen  (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins), twenty-two (Morton), sixty  (Crawford), or as sixty-three according to Burke.\"    And in the meantime, while your men of science are thus vacillating, in  the definition of the species of the only animal they have the  opportunity of studying inside and out, between one and sixty-three;  and disputing about the origin, in past ages, of what they cannot  define in the present ones; and deciphering the filthy heraldries which  record the relation of humanity to the ascidian and the crocodile, you  have ceased utterly to distinguish between the two species of man,  evermore separate by infinite separation: of whom the one, capable of  loyalty and of love, can at least conceive spiritual natures which have  no taint from their own, and leave behind them, diffused among  thousands on earth, the happiness they never hoped, for themselves, in  the skies; and the other, capable only of avarice, hatred, and shame,  who in their lives are the companions of the swine, and leave in death  nothing but food for the worm and the vulture.    62. Now I have first traced for you the relations of the creature we  are examining to those beneath it and above, to the bat and to the  falcon. But you will find that it has still others to entirely another  world. As you watch it glance and skim over the surface of the waters,  has it never struck you what relation it bears to the creatures that  glance and glide _under_ their surface? Fly-catchers, some of  them, also,--fly-catchers in the same manner, with wide mouth; while in  motion the bird almost exactly combines the dart of the trout with the  dash of the dolphin, to the rounded forehead and projecting muzzle of  which its own bullet head and bill exactly correspond. In its plunge,  if you watch it bathing, you may see it dip its breast just as much  under the water as a porpoise shows its back above. You can only  rightly describe the bird by the resemblances, and images of what it  seems to have changed from,--then adding the fantastic and beautiful  contrast of the unimaginable change. It is an owl that has been trained  by the Graces. It is a bat that loves the morning light. It is the  aerial reflection of a dolphin. It is the tender domestication of a  trout.    63. And yet be assured, as it cannot have been all these creatures, so  it has never, in truth, been any of them. The transformations believed  in by the mythologists are at least spiritually true; you cannot too  carefully trace or too accurately consider them. But the  transformations believed in by the anatomist are as yet proved true in  no single instance, and in no substance, spiritual or material; and I  cannot too often, or too earnestly, urge you not to waste your time in  guessing what animals may once have been, while you remain in nearly  total ignorance of what they are.    64. Do you even know distinctly from each other,--(for that is the real  naturalist's business; instead of confounding them with each  other),--do you know distinctly the five great species of this familiar  bird?--the swallow, the house-martin, the sand-martin, the swift, and  the Alpine swift?--or can you so much as answer the first question  which would suggest itself to any careful observer of the form of its  most familiar species,--yet which I do not find proposed, far less  answered, in any scientific book,--namely, why a swallow has a  swallow-tail?    It is true that the tail feathers in many birds appear to be  entirely,--even cumbrously, decorative; as in the peacock, and birds of  paradise. But I am confident that it is not so in the swallow, and that  the forked tail, so defined in form and strong in plume, has indeed  important functions in guiding the flight; yet notice how surrounded  one is on all sides with pitfalls for the theorists. The forked tail  reminds you at once of a fish's; and yet, the action of the two  creatures is wholly contrary. A fish lashes himself forward with his  tail, and steers with his fins; a swallow lashes himself forward with  his fins, and steers with his tail; partly, not necessarily, because in  the most dashing of the swallows, the swift, the fork of the tail is  the least developed. And I never watch the bird for a moment without  finding myself in some fresh puzzle out of which there is no clue in  the"]]]
