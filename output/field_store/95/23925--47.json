A voluminous miscellany, composed at various periods, cannot be exempt  from slight inadvertencies. Such a circuit of multifarious knowledge  could not be traced were we to measure and count each step by some  critical pedometer; life would be too short to effect any reasonable  progress. Every work must be judged by its design, and is to be valued  by its result.      BRADENHAM HOUSE,      _March_, 1839.          CONTENTS OF VOLUME I.

They shall continue blind among the blind.            But thou, O word, so clear, so strong, so pure,              Thou sayest all which I for goal have taken.            I give thee to the future!

The history of human growth and development is at the same time the  history of the terrible struggle of every new idea heralding the  approach of a brighter dawn.  In its tenacious hold on tradition, the  Old has never hesitated to make use of the foulest and cruelest means  to stay the advent of the New, in whatever form or period the latter  may have asserted itself.  Nor need we retrace our steps into the  distant past to realize the enormity of opposition, difficulties, and  hardships placed in the path of every progressive idea.  The rack,  the thumbscrew, and the knout are still with us; so are the convict's  garb and the social wrath, all conspiring against the spirit that is  serenely marching on.    Anarchism could not hope to escape the fate of all other ideas of  innovation.  Indeed, as the most revolutionary and uncompromising  innovator, Anarchism must needs meet with the combined ignorance and  venom of the world it aims to reconstruct.    To deal even remotely with all that is being said and done against  Anarchism would necessitate the writing of a whole volume.  I shall  therefore meet only two of the principal objections.  In so doing, I  shall attempt to elucidate what Anarchism really stands for.    The strange phenomenon of the opposition to Anarchism is that it  brings to light the relation between so-called intelligence and  ignorance.  And yet this is not so very strange when we consider the  relativity of all things.  The ignorant mass has in its favor that it  makes no pretense of knowledge or tolerance.  Acting, as it always  does, by mere impulse, its reasons are like those of a child.  \"Why?\"  \"Because.\"  Yet the opposition of the uneducated to Anarchism  deserves the same consideration as that of the intelligent man.    What, then, are the objections?  First, Anarchism is impractical,  though a beautiful ideal.  Second, Anarchism stands for violence and  destruction, hence it must be repudiated as vile and dangerous.  Both the intelligent man and the ignorant mass judge not from a  thorough knowledge of the subject, but either from hearsay or false  interpretation.    A practical scheme, says Oscar Wilde, is either one already in  existence, or a scheme that could be carried out under the existing  conditions; but it is exactly the existing conditions that one  objects to, and any scheme that could accept these conditions is  wrong and foolish.  The true criterion of the practical, therefore,  is not whether the latter can keep intact the wrong or foolish;  rather is it whether the scheme has vitality enough to leave the  stagnant waters of the old, and build, as well as sustain, new life.  In the light of this conception, Anarchism is indeed practical.  More than any other idea, it is helping to do away with the wrong and  foolish; more than any other idea, it is building and sustaining new  life.    The emotions of the ignorant man are continuously kept at a pitch by  the most blood-curdling stories about Anarchism.  Not a thing too  outrageous to be employed against this philosophy and its exponents.  Therefore Anarchism represents to the unthinking what the proverbial  bad man does to the child,--a black monster bent on swallowing  everything; in short, destruction and violence.    Destruction and violence!  How is the ordinary man to know that the  most violent element in society is ignorance; that its power of  destruction is the very thing Anarchism is combating?  Nor is he  aware that Anarchism, whose roots, as it were, are part of nature's  forces, destroys, not healthful tissue, but parasitic growths that  feed on the life's essence of society.  It is merely clearing the  soil from weeds and sagebrush, that it may eventually bear healthy  fruit.    Someone has said that it requires less mental effort to condemn than  to think.  The widespread mental indolence, so prevalent in society,  proves this to be only too true.  Rather than to go to the bottom of  any given idea, to examine into its origin and meaning, most people  will either condemn it altogether, or rely on some superficial or  prejudicial definition of non-essentials.    Anarchism urges man to think, to investigate, to analyze every  proposition; but that the brain capacity of the average reader be not  taxed too much, I also shall begin with a definition, and then  elaborate on the latter.         ANARCHISM:--The philosophy of a new social order based on         liberty unrestricted by man-made law; the theory that all         forms of government rest on violence, and are therefore wrong         and harmful, as well as unnecessary.    The new social order rests, of course, on the materialistic basis of  life; but while all Anarchists agree that the main evil today is an  economic one, they maintain that the solution of that evil can be  brought about only through the consideration of EVERY PHASE of  life,--individual, as well as the collective; the internal, as well  as the external phases.    A thorough perusal of the history of human development will disclose  two elements in bitter conflict with each other; elements that are  only now beginning to be understood, not as foreign to each other,  but as closely related and truly harmonious, if only placed in proper  environment: the individual and social instincts.  The individual and  society have waged a relentless and bloody battle for ages, each  striving for supremacy, because each was blind to the value and  importance of the other.  The individual and social instincts,--the  one a most potent factor for individual endeavor, for growth,  aspiration, self-realization; the other an equally potent factor for  mutual helpfulness and social well-being.    The explanation of the storm raging within the individual, and  between him and his surroundings, is not far to seek.  The primitive  man, unable to understand his being, much less the unity of all life,  felt himself absolutely dependent on blind, hidden forces ever ready  to mock and taunt him.  Out of that attitude grew the religious  concepts of man as a mere speck of dust dependent on superior powers  on high, who can only be appeased by complete surrender.  All the  early sagas rest on that idea, which continues to be the LEIT-MOTIF  of the biblical tales dealing with the relation of man to God, to the  State, to society.  Again and again the same motif, MAN IS NOTHING,  THE POWERS ARE EVERYTHING.  Thus Jehovah would only endure man on  condition of complete surrender.  Man can have all the glories of the  earth, but he must not become conscious of himself.  The State,  society, and moral laws all sing the same refrain: Man can have all  the glories of the earth, but he must not become conscious of  himself.    Anarchism is the only philosophy which brings to man the  consciousness of himself; which maintains that God, the State, and  society are non-existent, that their promises are null and void,  since they can be fulfilled only through man's subordination.  Anarchism is therefore the teacher of the unity of life; not merely  in nature, but in man.  There is no conflict between the individual  and the social instincts, any more than there is between the heart  and the lungs: the one the receptacle of a precious life essence, the  other the repository of the element that keeps the essence pure and  strong.  The individual is the heart of society, conserving the  essence of social life; society is the lungs which are distributing  the element to keep the life essence--that is, the individual--pure  and strong.    \"The one thing of value in the world,\" says Emerson, \"is the active  soul; this every man contains within him.  The soul active sees  absolute truth and utters truth and creates.\"  In other words, the  individual instinct is the thing of value in the world.  It is the  true soul that sees and creates the truth alive, out of which is to  come a still greater truth, the re-born social soul.    Anarchism is the great liberator of man from the phantoms that have  held him captive; it is the arbiter and pacifier of the two forces  for individual and social harmony.  To accomplish that unity,  Anarchism has declared war on the pernicious influences which have so  far prevented the harmonious blending of individual and social  instincts, the individual and society.    Religion, the dominion of the human mind; Property, the dominion of  human needs; and Government, the dominion of human conduct, represent  the stronghold of man's enslavement and all the horrors it entails.  Religion! How it dominates man's mind, how it humiliates and degrades  his soul.  God is everything, man is nothing, says religion.  But out  of that nothing God has created a kingdom so despotic, so tyrannical,  so cruel, so terribly exacting that naught but gloom and tears and  blood have ruled the world since gods began.  Anarchism rouses man to  rebellion against this black monster.  Break your mental fetters, says  Anarchism to man, for not until you think and judge for yourself will  you get rid of the dominion of darkness, the greatest obstacle to all  progress.    Property, the dominion of man's needs, the denial of the right to  satisfy his needs.  Time was when property claimed a divine right,  when it came to man with the same refrain,"]]]
