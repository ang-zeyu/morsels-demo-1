Only when such a general framework of theory  is built up by a logical postulate, is the way open to make use of all  those observations of the laboratory and of the clinic, of the zooelogist  and of the anatomist. It is the theory which has to give the right  setting to those scattered observations. However far we may be from  being able to point to the special brain process which lies at the  bottom of the higher mental state, we know beforehand that there is no  shadow of an idea, no fringe of a feeling, no suggestion of a desire  which does not correspond to definite processes in the brain. The  details may and must be material for diverging theories, but the  conflict of such hypothetical opinions has nothing to do with the  certainty of the underlying conviction that if we knew the whole truth,  we should recognize every single mental happening as parallel to  physical processes in the nervous system. To explain mental facts means  to think them as parallel to the brain processes which have their own  causal connections in the physical world.    We started, for instance, from the old observation that two impressions  which come to our mind at the same time have a tendency to reawaken one  another; and we saw that psychology was well able to formulate these  facts in general statements of the association of ideas. But we realized  that that in itself is not really explanation. If the odor which we  smell awakes in us the name of a chemical substance, and if we now bring  this under the general heading of association of ideas, an explanation  is not really given by it. That smell sensation itself is not really  understood as a cause of those sound sensations of the word. We have no  insight into the connection of those two happenings. But the situation  is entirely changed, if we consider the smell effect from the point of  view of the parallelistic theory. Now the association of facts would  indicate that we got the first two impressions together, because two  brain processes were going on at the same time. My nose brought me the  smell stimulus, my ear gave me the sound stimulus, each going on in a  particular center, or, to express it in a simplified schematic way, each  reaching particular brain cells, and the excitement of these brain cells  being accompanied by the particular sensations. The physiologist has  many possibilities of conceiving the further stages of the process, in  order to satisfy the demand of explanation. He may say the excitement of  each of these two brain cells, the one in the olfactory center, the  other in the auditory center, irradiates in all directions through the  fine branches of the brain fibers. Each cell has relations to every  other cell in the brain; thus there is also one connecting path between  those two cells which were stimulated at once. Now if the two ends of an  anatomical path are excited at the same time, the path itself becomes  changed. The connecting way becomes a path of least resistance, and that  means that if, in future, one of the two brain cells becomes excited  again, the overflow of the nervous excitement will not now go on easily  in all directions, but only just along that one channel which leads to  that other brain cell. A theory like this explains in real explanatory  terms, in ways which physics and chemistry can demonstrate as necessary,  that any excitement of the odor cell runs over into the sound cell and  vice versa. In short, the psychological association of ideas, which we  should simply have to accept as inexplainable fact, is thus transformed  into a connection which we understand as necessary; and the fact is  really explained.    This simple scheme of the physiology of association for a hundred years  has given a most decided impulse to the progress of psychology. As the  association process can so easily be expressed in physiological terms,  the aim was prevalent to understand the interplay of mental life more  and more as the result of association. The underlying thought of this  whole association psychology was thus a conviction that whenever two  mental experiences occur together, either of them keeps the tendency to  reawaken the other at a later time. Through the endless combination  which life's impressions awaken in the mind from the first hour after  birth, the whole stream of memory images and thoughts and aims and  imaginations is thus to be explained.    The whole theory of physiological associationism works evidently with  two factors. First, there are millions of brain cells of which each one  may have its particular quality of sensation, and second, each brain  cell may work with any degree of energy, to which the intensity of the  sensation would correspond. If I distinguish ten thousand different  pitches of tone, they would be located in ten thousand different cell  groups, each one connected through a special fiber with a special string  in the ear. And each of these tones may be loud or faint, corresponding  to the amount of excitement in the particular cell group. Every other  variation must then result from the millionfold connections between  these brain cells. Indeed, the brain furnishes all possibilities for  such a theory. We know how every brain cell resolves itself into  tree-like branch systems which can take up excitements from all sides,  and how it can carry its own excitement through long connecting fibers  to distant places, and how the endings of these fibers clasp into the  branches of the next cell, allowing the propagation of excitement from  cell to cell. We know further how large spheres of the brain are  confined to cells of particular function, that for instance cells which  serve visual sensations are in the rear part of the brain hemispheres,  and so on. Finally we know how millions of connecting fibers represent  paths in all directions, allowing very well a cooeperation by association  between the most distant parts of the brain. The theories found their  richest development, when it was recognized that large spheres of our  brain centers evidently do not serve at all merely sensory states, but  that their cells have as their function only the intermediating between  different sensory centers. Such so-called association centers are thus  like complex switchboards between the various mental centers. Their own  activity is not accompanied by any mental content, but has only the  function of regulating transmission of the excitement from the one to  the other. Above all their operation would make it possible that through  associative processes, the wonderful complexity of our trains of thought  may be reached.    Yet even the highest development of the association theories did not  seem to do justice to the whole richness of the inner life. We may well  understand through those association processes that a rich supply of  memory pictures is at our disposal, that ideas stream plentifully to our  minds and enter into new and ever new combinations. But that alone is  not an account of our inner experience. If there is anything essential  for inner life, it is the attention which gives emphasis to certain  states and neglects others. And that means that certain mental contents  are growing not only in strength but in vividness and clearness, and  that others are losing their vividness, are inhibited and suppressed.  Here were always the real difficulties of the association theories; they  seemed so entirely unable to explain from their own means why certain  states become foremost in our minds and others fade away, why some have  the power to grow and others are neglected. These facts of attention and  vividness, inhibition and fading, worked almost as a temptation to give  up the physiological explanation altogether and to rely on some mystical  power, some mental influence which could pull and push the ideas without  any interference and help from the side of the brain. Yet since we have  seen that the truth of psychophysical parallelism has the meaning of a  postulate which we cannot escape unless we want to give up explanation  altogether, it is evident that such falling back into un-physiological  agencies would be just as inconsistent as if the naturalist should posit  miracles in the midst of chemistry or astronomy. If the facts which  cluster about attention cannot be understood by the simple scheme of  associationism, the demand must be for a better physiological theory.    The development of physiological psychology in recent years has indeed  shown the way to such a wider theory, which furnishes the physiological  accompaniment also for those experiences of attention and vividness  which form the weakness of associationism. This new development has come  up with the growing insight that the brain's mental functions are  related not only to the sensory impressions, but at the same time to the  motor expressions. The older view, still prevalent to-day in popular  writings, made the brain the reservoir of physical stimuli, which come  from the sense organs to the cortex of the brain hemispheres. There the  perceptions arose and through associative interplay the memory pictures  and the ideas of action and the feelings arose, and the whole inner life  was thus bound up with the processes in these sensorial spheres. When  the mind had done its work, finally an impulse was sent to some motor  apparatus in the brain which then sent off the impulse to some acting  muscles. That whole motor part was thus a kind of appendix to the brain  process. The psychical life had nothing to do with it but to give the  command for its action. The process in the motor part thus began when  the mental proceeding was completed.

A crumbling block of  masonry, the story of which is quite unknown, a round chapel dating from  the days when Christianity was young among the Slavs and still found  ready martyrs in its cause even among princes, and an _enceinte_ of  brick fortifications, stone-faced and in Vauban's best style, battered  by Frederick the Great's guns, are all that Vy[vs]ehrad has to show by  way of relics of a stormy past.    Vy[vs]ehrad is about the first striking view you obtain of Prague as the  _train de luxe_ brings you round a bend before crossing the railway  bridge over the Vltava. Travellers seeing Prague for the first time are  apt to mistake this hill of Vy[vs]ehrad for the castle. I did so myself;  my delight, therefore, at the first sight of Prague's crowning glory,  the Hrad[vs]any, was all the greater.    Seen against the evening sky, Vy[vs]ehrad looks very imposing; it is at  its best by winter twilight, when the heavy mass is dully reflected on  the surface of the frozen river. Then you may gain some idea of what  this rugged promontory stands for in the life-history of a race that has  passed through great tribulation. Two Gothic spires point to the skies,  rising from a church which, despite its newness, seems more in accord  with the spirit of Prague than do the copper domes of Jesuit  structures; but then this church is built on foundations so ancient as  to defy investigation by the most assiduous chroniclers. No doubt those  spires are right enough in their way, but they are almost painfully  modern and unromantic compared to a square bit of crumbling masonry that  clings limpet-like to the crags of Vy[vs]ehrad overhanging the river at  the feet of the twin church towers. For here, according to legend, is  the cradle of the city of Prague. In popular parlance this bit of  masonry is called Libu[vs]a's bath, and hereby hangs a tale to introduce  which we must hark back some fourteen centuries.           *       *       *       *       *    Some time in the sixth century--nobody seems to know exactly or to care  much when it was--one Czech or Czechus was wandering about this land of  Bohemia with a party of friends and relatives, probably a whole tribe of  them. Czech seems to have had the country to himself; if he had met any  strangers there would have been a fight, and we should have heard about  it. It may therefore be assumed that the former occupants, probably  lodgers only, had moved on. There was much movement going on in those  early centuries of the Christian era, the main tendency being from  north-east to south-west, from cold, damp and short-commons to warmth  and plenty. Now we have sufficient reason to believe that Thuringians  and Rugians abode for a while in Bohemia and parts of Bavaria, and  Lombards in Moravia, and that these gentry, hearing of loot to be had in  plenty farther south, left their temporary homes, crossed the Danube and  made themselves unpopular elsewhere, leaving the lands of Bohemia and  Moravia to anyone who cared to take them. This happened some time about  the middle of the sixth century, which gives us something more definite  to go upon as to Czech's place in time. Anyway, there were Czech, his  friends and relations wandering at their own sweet pleasure over the  rolling wood-clad landscape of Bohemia. On this excursion Czech espied  from afar a peculiar shaped hill (not one of the hills of Prague) to  which he promptly gave the appropriate name of [vR]ip. Now this  innocent-looking word is, by virtue of the sign placed over the R,  pronounced in a peculiar manner; between the initial consonant and the  \"i\" you should insert a sound somewhat like that of the French \"j\" as in  \"jamais,\" for instance. Heaven and the Czechs only know what meaning you  would convey did you neglect this euphonious concatenation of consonants  and simply say \"rip\"--probably something to cover the young person with  confusion; but rightly pronounced, and with due regard to the soft but  insistent sibilant, this mixture of sounds means--toadstool. It is all  so simple when once you know: [vR]ip = toadstool,--and there you are.  The description tallies too: the hill of [vR]ip does look like a  toadstool; I have seen it myself, and am prepared to support Czech's  statement on oath. Anyway, [vR]ip stands there still, much the same as  when Czech discovered it, but for a chapel dedicated to St. George on  its summit, the result of some one else's piety.    You can see [vR]ip for miles round, as it has chosen a fairly level  plain out of which to arise much like a mushroom on the lawn after a  rainy night. No wonder, then, that Czech made straight for [vR]ip,  climbed to the top, looked around him, approved of what he saw, and  decided to stay. He did, so did his friends and relatives and those that  came after them, and no power on earth was able to shift them. The  descendants of Czech are there still. One of these told me that the best  and sturdiest type of Czech is bred round about [vR]ip; he was born  thereabouts himself, and should know. I am prepared to believe it  anyway, as my friend is certainly of the best and sturdiest type of  Czech.    That much for Czech and his descendants; we must now skip a century or  two which even Cosmas of Prague was unable to fill out with legend, and  return to the lady whose bath I have already referred to. Not that I  believe the ruined bits of wall to have contained a lady's bathroom; I  have tried to imagine Libu[vs]a using the place for the morning tub,  and have failed to conjure up any picture that would carry conviction.  However, I do not wish to prejudice the case; come out to Prague and  judge for yourself.    Libu[vs]a was one of three sisters, daughters of Krok, Prince of  Bohemia, or at least some part of it, for frontiers in those very early  days were even more elastic than those drawn by International  Commissions. Anyway, there was Krok lording it over as much of Bohemia  as he could control, from his fastness of Vy[vs]ehrad. Of Libu[vs]a's  sisters, Kazi and Teta, nothing but their names is known even in legend;  they passed into oblivion on Krok's demise, for he ordained that  Libu[vs]a, his youngest daughter, should succeed him. Libu[vs]a,  according to legend, was a model of all the virtues, and as in those  days there was no ever-ready Press lurking to pounce on historical  inaccuracies, we may accept the statement of kindly Saga.    Libu[vs]a had a rare gift, one which proved uncomfortable to other  ladies of legend similarly endowed, uncomfortable both to themselves and  their belongings, the gift of prophecy. She foretold the future  greatness of Prague, and undoubtedly spotted a winner. This was not the  only occasion either, for she did herself a good turn too by means of  her supernatural power. As it happened, despite her possession of all  the virtues, she had trouble with her subjects, who declared themselves  weary of petticoat government and urged her to look round for a husband.  She did, calling to aid her uncanny gift. The discussion with her  subjects probably took place in the open, high up on Vy[vs]ehrad.  Libu[vs]a, with that far-away gaze proper to all soothsaying, pointed  out over the distant hills, saying, \"Behind those hills is a small river  called Belna, and on its bank a farm named Stadic. Near that farm is a  field, and in that field your future ruler is ploughing with two spotted  oxen. His name is P[vr]emysl, and his descendants will rule over you for  ever. Take my horse and follow it; you will be led to the place.\"    The lady was not quite correct about P[vr]emysl and his  descendants--they have ceased to rule over the Czechs, and are now  replaced by a sovereign people; but she certainly was right in her  description of her future husband and his surroundings. The search  party, following Libu[vs]a's horse, found P[vr]emysl busy at his plough,  roped him in and brought him to their Princess. Legend again asserts  that P[vr]emysl made a first-class husband and ruler (he probably did  exactly as his wife told him) and his descendants reigned with varying  fortunes, until the first years of the fourteenth century--a very good  innings for the lineage of P[vr]emysl, the sturdy farmer, and that  far-seeing lady Libu[vs]a, his wife. During those centuries the Czechs  had consolidated into an important kingdom; from a misty chaos of  heathen Slavonic tribes had grown a people brave and generous, with a  culture all its own, and above all with a surpassing gift of expressing  itself in music.    It must not be supposed that Libu[vs]a rested content with being wife to  P[vr]emysl, just keeping house, mending clothes and minding the babies.  She continued her activities as directress of her people's fortunes, and  is made responsible, among other matters, for choosing the site of the  Hrad[vs]any, the Castle of Prague, and this is what the chronicler has  to say about it.    One day as Libu[vs]a looked out from her fastness over the river towards  the wooded heights to northward, she was moved by the gift of prophecy  to which she was addicted when deeply stirred.    Her own abode, built by her father, hung upon that rocky crag called  Vy[vs]ehrad, and was probably by no means roomy; Krok, her father, had  no doubt found it a convenient spot, being somewhat difficult of access  in those days to armed visitors, who were likely to prove a disturbing  element. The ancient Slav preferred to build in secluded spots, on  heights amid forests for choice, there was so much to guard against in  those dark ages, so the wooded heights that Libu[vs]a looked out upon  must have appealed to her strongly. Anyway, she decided to act,  prefacing action by some quite useful sooth-saying. According to the  chronicler Cosmas of Prague, who lived three or four centuries after  Libu[vs]a had passed away, the following impressive scene was enacted:  Libu[vs"]]]
