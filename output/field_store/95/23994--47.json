In considering this further aspect it is necessary for  reasons already given, to place hygienic considerations first.    Is it reasonable to suppose that Nature ever intended the milk of the  cow or the egg of the fowl for the use of man as food? Can anyone deny  that Nature intended the cow's milk for the nourishment of her calf and  the hen's egg for the propagation of her species? It is begging the  question to say that the cow furnishes more milk than her calf requires,  or that it does not injure the hen to steal her eggs. Besides, it is not  true.    Regarding the dietetic value of milk and eggs, which is the question of  first importance, are we correct in drawing the inference that as Nature  did not intend these foods for man, therefore they are not suitable for  him? As far as the chemical constituents of these foods are concerned,  it is true they contain compounds essential to the nourishment of the  human body, and if this is going to be set up as an argument in favor of  their consumption, let it be remembered that flesh food also contains  compounds essential to nourishment. But the point is this: not what  valuable nutritive compounds does any food-substance contain, but what  value, _taking into consideration its total effects_, has the food in  question as a wholesome article of diet?    It seems to be quite generally acknowledged by the medical profession  that raw milk is a dangerous food on account of the fact that it is  liable from various causes, sometimes inevitable, to contain impurities.  Dr. Kellogg writes: Typhoid fever, cholera infantum, tuberculosis and  tubercular consumption--three of the most deadly diseases known; it is  very probable also, that diphtheria, scarlet fever and several other  maladies are communicated through the medium of milk.... It is safe to  say that very few people indeed are fully acquainted with the dangers to  life and health which lurk in the milk supply.... The teeming millions  of China, a country which contains nearly one-third of the entire  population of the globe, are practically ignorant of this article of  food. The high-class Hindoo regards milk as a loathsome and impure  article of food, speaking of it with the greatest contempt as  \"cow-juice,\" doubtless because of his observations of the deleterious  effect of the use of milk in its raw state.    The germs of tuberculosis seem to be the most dangerous in milk, for  they thrive and retain their vitality for many weeks, even in butter and  cheese. An eminent German authority, Hirschberger, is said to have found  10 per cent of the cows in the vicinity of large cities to be affected  by tuberculosis. Many other authorities might be quoted supporting the  contention that a large percentage of cows are afflicted by this deadly  disease. Other germs, quite as dangerous, find their way into milk in  numerous ways. Excreta, clinging to the hairs of the udder, are  frequently rubbed off into the pail by the action of the hand whilst  milking. Under the most careful sanitary precautions it is impossible to  obtain milk free from manure, from the ordinary germs of putrefaction to  the most deadly microbes known to science. There is little doubt but  that milk is one of the uncleanest and impurest of all foods.    Milk is constipating, and as constipation is one of the commonest  complaints, a preventive may be found in abstinence from this food. As  regards eggs, there is perhaps not so much to be said, although eggs so  quickly undergo a change akin to putrefaction that unless eaten fresh  they are unfit for food; moreover, (according to Dr. Haig) they contain  a considerable amount of xanthins, and cannot, therefore, be considered  a desirable food.    Dairy foods, we emphatically affirm, are not necessary to health. In the  section dealing with 'Physical Considerations' sufficient was said to  prove the eminent value of an exclusive vegetable diet, and the reader  is referred to that and the subsequent essay on Nutrition and Diet for  proof that man can and should live without animal food of any kind. Such  nutritive properties as are possessed by milk and eggs are abundantly  found in the vegetable kingdom. The table of comparative values given,  exhibits this quite plainly. That man can live a thoroughly healthy life  upon vegetable foods alone there is ample evidence to prove, and there  is good cause to believe that milk and eggs not only are quite  unnecessary, but are foods unsuited to the human organism, and may be,  and often are, the cause of disease. Of course, it is recognized that  with scrupulous care this danger can be minimized to a great extent, but  still it is always there, and as there is no reason why we should  consume such foods, it is not foolish to continue to do so?    But this is not all. It is quite as impossible to consume dairy produce  without slaughter as it is to eat flesh without slaughter. There are  probably as many bulls born as cows. One bull for breeding purposes  suffices for many cows and lives for many years, so what is to be done  with the bull calves if our humanitarian scruples debar us from  providing a vocation for the butcher? The country would soon be overrun  with vast herds of wild animals and the whole populace would have to  take to arms for self-preservation. So it comes to the same thing. If  we did not breed these animals for their flesh, or milk, or eggs, or  labour, we should have no use for them, and so should breed them no  longer, and they would quickly become extinct. The wild goat and sheep  and the feathered life might survive indefinitely in mountainous  districts, but large animals that are not domesticated, or bred for  slaughter, soon disappear before the approach of civilisation. The Irish  elk is extinct, and the buffalo of North America has been wiped out  during quite recent years. If leather became more expensive (much of it  is derived from horse hide) manufacturers of leather substitutes would  have a better market than they have at present.          VI    CONCLUSION      'However much thou art read in theory, if thou hast no practice thou art  ignorant,' says the Persian poet Sa'di. 'Conviction, were it never so  excellent, is worthless until it converts itself into Conduct. Nay,  properly, Conviction is not possible till then,' says Herr  Teufelsdrockh. It is never too late to be virtuous. It is right that we  should look before we leap, but it is gross misconduct to neglect duty  to conform to the consuetudes of the hour. We must endeavour in  practical life to carry out to the best of our ability our philosophical  and ethical convictions, for any lapse in such endeavour is what  constitutes immorality. We must live consistently with theory so long as  our chief purpose in life is advanced by so doing, but we must be  inconsistent when by antinomianism we better forward this purpose. To  illustrate: All morally-minded people desire to serve as a force working  for the happiness of the race. We are convinced that the slaughter of  animals for food is needless, and that it entails much physical and  mental suffering among men and animals and is therefore immoral.  Knowing this we should exert our best efforts to counteract the wrong,  firstly, by regulating our own conduct so as not to take either an  active or passive part in this needless massacre of sub-human life, and  secondly, by making those facts widely known which show the necessity  for food reform.    Now to go to the ultimate extreme as regards our own conduct we should  make no use of such things as leather, bone, catgut, etc. We should not  even so much as attend a concert where the players use catgut strings,  for however far distantly related cause and effect may be, the fact  remains that the more the demand, no matter how small, the more the  supply. We should not even be guilty of accosting a friend from over the  way lest in consequence he take more steps than otherwise he would do,  thus wearing out more shoe-leather. He who would practise such absurd  sansculottism as this would have to resort to the severest seclusion,  and plainly enough we cannot approve of such fanaticism. By turning  antinomian when necessary and staying amongst our fellows, making known  our views according to our ability and opportunity, we shall be doing  more towards establishing the proper relation between man and sub-man  than by turning cenobite and refusing all intercourse and association  with our fellows. Let us do small wrong that we may accomplish great  good. Let us practise our creed so far as to abstain from the eating of  animal food, and from the use of furs, feathers, seal and fox skins, and  similar ornaments, to obtain which necessitates the violation of our  fundamental principles. With regard to leather, this material is, under  present conditions, a 'by-product.' The hides of animals slaughtered for  their flesh are made into leather, and it is not censurable in a  vegetarian to use this article in the absence of a suitable substitute  when he knows that by so doing he is not asking an animal's life, nor a  fellow-being to degrade his character by taking it. There is a  substitute for leather now on the market, and it is hoped that it may  soon be in demand, for even a leather-tanner's work is not exactly an  ideal occupation.    Looking at the question of conviction and consistency in this way, there  are conceivable circumstances when the staunchest vegetarian may even  turn kreophagist. As to how far it is permissible to depart from the  strictest adherence to the principles of vegetarianism that have been  laid down, the individual must trust his own conscience to determine;  but we can confidently affirm that the eating of animal flesh is  unnecessary and immoral and retards"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#8)"],[1,"surrounded  all these buildings with a vast and lofty wall.\" Also \"he duly arranged  all that was necessary for the table and clothing of the monks,\" and \"many  lands which had been taken away he brought back into the property of the  Church and restored to it twenty-five manors.\" He also added one hundred  to the original number of the monks, and drew up a new system of  discipline to correct the laxity which was rife when he entered on the  primacy. He tells Anselm in a letter that \"the land in which he is, is  daily shaken with so many and so great tribulations, is stained with so  many adulteries and other impurities, that no order of men consults for  the benefit of his soul, or even desires to hear the salutary doctrine of  God for his increase in holiness.\" Perhaps the most interesting feature of  his reconstruction of the \"regula,\" or rule for the monks' discipline, was  his enactment with regard to the library and the studies of the brethren.  In the first week in Lent, the monks had to bring back and place in the  Chapter House the books which had been provided for their instruction  during the previous year. Those who had not duly performed the yearly  portion of reading prostrated themselves, confessing their fault and  asking pardon. A fresh distribution was then made, and the brethren  retired, each furnished with a year's literary task. Apparently no  examination was held, no test applied to discover whether the last year's  instruction had been digested and assimilated. It was assumed that  anything like a perfunctory performance of the allotted task was out  of the question.    Another important alteration introduced by Lanfranc was his inauguration  of the system under which the monastery was in immediate charge, no longer  of the archbishop, but of a prior. Henceforward the primate stood forth as  the head of the Church, rather than as merely the chief of her most  ancient foundation.    We have dwelt at some length on the subject of the monastery at  Canterbury, because, as we have said, it is impossible to learn the  lesson of the cathedral truly, unless we regard the fabric in its original  setting, surrounded by monastic buildings; and it is impossible to  interest ourselves in the monastic buildings without knowing something of  the institution which they housed.    [Illustration: DETAIL OF ST. ANSELM'S TOWER.]    The buildings which contained a great #monastery# like that of Canterbury  were necessarily very extensive. Chief among them was the chapter house,  which generally adjoined the principal cloister, bounded by the nave of  the church and one of the transepts. Then there were the buildings  necessary for the actual housing and daily living of the monks--the  dormitory, refectory, kitchen, buttery, and other indispensable offices.  Another highly important building, usually standing eastward of the  church, was the infirmary or hospital for sick brethren, with its chapel  duly attached. Further, the rules of Benedictine monasteries always  enjoined the strict observance of the duty of hospitality, and some part  of the buildings was invariably set aside for the due entertainment of  strangers of various ranks. Visitors of distinction were entertained in  special rooms which generally were attached to the house of the prior or  abbot: guests of a lower order were lodged hard by the hall of the  cellarer; while poor pilgrims and chance wanderers who craved a night's  shelter were bestowed, as a rule, near the main gate of the monastery.  Lastly, it must not be forgotten that a well-endowed monastery was always  the steward of a great estate, so that many storehouses and  farm-buildings--barns, granaries, bakehouse, etc.--were a necessary part  of the institution. Extensive stabling was also required to shelter the  horses of illustrious visitors and their suites. Moreover, the clergy  themselves were often greatly addicted to the chase, and we know that the  pious St. Thomas found time to cultivate a taste for horseflesh, which was  remarkable even in those days when all men who wanted to move at all were  bound to ride. The knights who murdered him thought it worth while to  pillage his stable after accomplishing their errand.    [Illustration: THE CHRISTCHURCH GATE  (FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY CARL NORMAN AND CO).]    The centre round which all these manifold buildings and offices were  ranged was, of course, the cathedral. Wherever available space and the  nature of the ground permitted it, the cloister and chief buildings were  placed under the shelter of the church on its southern side, as may be  seen, for instance, at Westminster, where the cloisters, chapter house,  deanery, refectory (now the College Hall), etc., are all gathered on the  south side of the Abbey. At Canterbury, however, the builders were not  able to follow the usual practice, owing to the fact that they were hemmed  in closely by the houses of the city on the south side, so that we find  that the space between the north side of the cathedral and the city wall,  all of which belonged to the monks, was the site of the monastic  buildings. The whole group formed by the cathedral and the subsidiary  buildings was girt by a massive wall, which was restored and made more  effective as a defence by Lanfranc. It is probable that some of the  remains of this wall, which still survive, may be considered as dating  from his time. The chief gate, both in ancient and modern days, is Prior  Goldstone's Gate, usually known as #Christ Church Gate#, an exceedingly  good example of the later Perpendicular style. A contemporary inscription  tells us that it was built in 1517. It stands at the end of Mercery Lane,  a lofty building with towers at its corners, and two storeys above the  archway. In front there is a central niche, in which an image of our  Saviour originally stood, while below a row of shields, much battered and  weather-beaten, display armorial bearings, doubtless those of pious  contributors to the cost of the building. An early work of Turner's has  preserved the corner pinnacles which once decorated the top of the gate;  these were removed some thirty years ago.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH-WEST PORCH OF THE CATHEDRAL.]    [Illustration: CLOISTERS OF THE MONKS' INFIRMARY.]    Entering the precincts through this gateway we find ourselves in what was  the _outer_ cemetery, in which members of the laity were allowed to be  buried. The _inner_ cemetery, reserved as a resting-place for the brethren  themselves, was formerly divided from the outer by a wall which extended  from St. Anselm's chapel. A Norman door, which was at one time part of  this wall, has now been put into a wall at the east end of the monks'  burying ground. This space is now called \"The Oaks.\" A bell tower,  _campanile_, doubtless used for tolling the passing bell, once stood on a  mound in the cemetery, close to the dividing wall. The houses on the south  side of this space are of no great antiquity or interest, and the site on  which they stand did not become part of the monastery grounds before a  comparatively late period. But if we skirt the east end of the cathedral  we come to the space formerly known as the \"Homors,\" a word supposed to be  a corruption of _Ormeaux_, a French word, meaning elms.[1] Here stood the  building in which guests of rank and distinction were entertained; and the  great hall, with its kitchen and offices, is still preserved in a house in  the north-east corner of the inclosure, now the residence of one of the  prebendaries. The original building was one of great importance in a  monastery like Canterbury, which was so often visited, as has already been  shown, by royal pilgrims. It is said to have been rebuilt from top to  bottom by Prior Chillenden, and the nature of the architecture, as far as  it can be traced, is not in any way at variance with this statement. The  hall, as it originally stood, was pierced with oriel windows rising to the  roof, and at its western end a walled-off portion was divided into two  storeys, the lower one containing the kitchens, while the upper one was  either a distinct room separated from the hall, or it may have been a  gallery opening upon it.      [1] Though it is also derived from one Dr. Omerus, who lived on the spot    in the thirteenth century.    To the west of this house we find the #ruins of the Infirmary#, which  contained a long hall with aisles, and a chapel at the east end. The hall  was used as the hospital, and the aisles were sometimes divided into  separate compartments; the chapel was really part of the hall, with only a  screen intervening, so that the sick brethren could take part in the  services. This infirmary survived until the Reformation period, but not  without undergoing alterations. Before the fifteenth century the south  aisle was devoted to the use of the sub-prior, and the chancel at the east  end of the chapel was partially restored about the middle of the  fourteenth century. A large east window was put in with three-light  windows on each side. In the north wall there is a curious opening,  through which, perhaps, sufferers from infectious diseases were allowed to  assist at the services. On the southern side, the whole row of the pillars  and arches of the chapel, and some traces of a clerestory, still remain.  On the wall are some traces of paintings, which are too faded to be  deciphered. Such of the pillars and arches of the hall as still survive  are strongly coloured by the great fire of 1174, in which Prior Conrad's  choir was destroyed.    [Illustration: RUINS OF THE MONKS' INFIRMARY.]    [Illustration: THE BAPTISTERY TOWER.]    Westward of the infirmary, and connected with St. Andrew's tower, stands a  strikingly beautiful building, which was once #the Vestiarium, or  Treasury#: it consists of two storeys, of which the lower is open on the  east and west, while the upper contained the treasury chamber, a finely  proportioned room,"]]]
