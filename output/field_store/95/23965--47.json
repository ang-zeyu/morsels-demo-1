Why  should you sharpen a knife?\"    The man could not help telling the truth to the manito, and so he  answered, but greatly against his will, \"I am sharpening the knife to  kill the wicked animals.\"    \"Which animal is wicked?\" asked the manito. \"Which one does you harm?\"    [Illustration: THE KNIFE ONLY WENT IN DEEPER]    \"Not one does me harm,\" said the man, \"but I do not like them. I will  make them afraid of me, and I will kill them.\"    \"You are a cruel, wicked man,\" said the manito. \"The animals have done  you no harm, and you do not need them for food. You shall no longer be a  man. You shall be a deer, and be afraid of every man in the forest.\"    The knife fell from the man's hand and struck his foot. He leaped and  stamped, but the knife only went in deeper. He cried aloud, but his  voice sounded strange. His hands were no longer hands, but feet. Antlers  grew from his head, and his whole body was not that of a man, but that  of a deer. He runs in the forest as he will, but whenever he sees a man,  he is afraid. His hoofs are split because the knife that he had made so  sharp fell upon his foot when he was a man; and whenever he looks at  them, he has to remember that it was his own wickedness which made him a  deer.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST GRASSHOPPER.      In a country that is far away there once lived a young man called  Tithonus. He was strong and beautiful. Light of heart and light of foot,  he hunted the deer or danced and sang the livelong day. Every one who  saw him loved him, but the one that loved him most was a goddess named  Aurora.    Every goddess had her own work, but the work of Aurora was most  beautiful of all, for she was the goddess of the morning. It was she who  went out to meet the sun and to light up his pathway. She watched over  the flowers, and whenever they saw her coming, their colors grew  brighter. She loved everything beautiful, and that is why she loved  Tithonus.    \"Many a year have I roamed through this country,\" she said to herself,  \"but never have I seen such bright blue eyes as those. O fairest of  youths,\" she cried, \"who are you? Some name should be yours that sounds  like the wind in the pine trees, or like the song of a bird among the  first blossoms.\"    The young man fell upon his knees before her. \"I know well,\" said he,  \"that you are no maiden of the earth. You are a goddess come down to us  from the skies. I am but a hunter, and I roam through the forest looking  for deer.\"    \"Come with me, fairest of hunters,\" said Aurora. \"Come with me to the  home of my father. You shall live among my brothers and hunt with them,  or go with me at the first brightness of the morning to carry light and  gladness to the flowers.\"    So it was that Tithonus went away from his own country and his own home  to live in the home of Aurora.    For a long time they were happy together, but one day Aurora said,  \"Tithonus, I am a goddess, and so I am immortal, but some day death will  bear you away from me. I will ask the father of the gods that you too  may be immortal.\"    Then Aurora went to the king of the gods and begged that he would make  Tithonus immortal.    \"Sometimes people are not pleased even when I have given them what they  ask,\" replied the king, \"so think well before you speak.\"    \"I have only one wish,\" said Aurora, \"and it is that Tithonus, the  fairest of youths, shall be immortal.\"    \"You have your wish,\" said the king of the gods, and again Tithonus and  Aurora roamed happily together through forest and field.    One day Tithonus asked, \"My Aurora, why is it that I cannot look  straight into your eyes as once I did?\" Another day he said, \"My Aurora,  why is it that I cannot put my hand in yours as once I did?\"    Then the goddess wept sorrowfully. \"The king of the gods gave me what I  asked for,\" she wailed, \"and I begged that you should be immortal. I did  not remember to ask that you should be always young.\"    Everyday Tithonus grew older and smaller. \"I am no longer happy in your  father's home,\" he said, \"with your brothers who are as beautiful and as  strong as I was when I first saw you. Let me go back to my own country.  Let me be a bird or an insect and live in the fields where we first  roamed together. Let me go, dearest goddess.\"    \"You shall do as you will,\" replied Aurora sadly. \"You shall be a  grasshopper, and whenever I hear the grasshopper's clear, merry song, I  shall remember the happy days when we were together.\"          THE STORY OF THE ORIOLE.      The king of the north once said to himself, \"I am master of the country  of ice and snow, but what is that if I cannot be ruler of the land of  sunshine and flowers? I am no king if I fear the king of the south. The  northwind shall bear my icy breath. Bird and beast shall quiver and  tremble with cold. I myself will call in the voice of the thunder, and  this ruler of the south, his king of summer, shall yield to my power.\"    The land of the south was ever bright and sunny, but all at once the sky  grew dark, and the sun hid himself in fear. Black storm-clouds came from  the north. An icy wind blew over the mountains. It wrestled with the  trees of the southland, and even the oaks could not stand against its  power. Their roots were tough and strong, but they had to yield, and the  fallen trees lay on the earth and wailed in sorrow as the cruel  storm-wind and rain beat upon them. The thunder growled in the hollows  of the mountains, and in the fearful gloom came the white fire of the  forked lightning, flaring through the clouds.    \"We shall perish,\" cried the animals of the sunny south. \"The arrows of  the lightning are aimed at us. O dear ruler of the southland, must we  yield to the cruel master of the north?\"    \"My king,\" said a little buzzing voice, \"may I go out and fight the  wicked master of the storm-wind?\"    The thunder was still for a moment, and a mocking laugh was heard from  among the clouds, for it was a little hornet that had asked to go out  and meet the power of the ruler of the north.    \"Dear king, may I go?\" repeated the hornet.    \"Yes, you may go,\" said the king of the south, and the little insect  went out alone, and bravely stung the master of the storm-wind.    The king of the north struck at him with a war-club, but the hornet only  flew above his head and stung him again. The hornet was too small to be  struck by the arrows of the lightning. He stung again and again, and at  last the king of the north went back to his own country, and drove  before him the thunder and lightning and rain and the black storm-clouds  and the icy wind.    \"Brave little hornet,\" said the king of the south, \"tell me what I can  do for you. You shall have whatever you ask.\"    Then said the little hornet, \"My king, on all the earth no one loves me.  I do not wish to harm people, but they fear my sting, and they will not  let me live beside their homes. Will you make men love me?\"    \"Little hornet,\" said the king gently, \"you shall no longer be a  stinging insect feared by men. You shall be a bright and happy oriole,  and when men see you, they will say, 'See the beautiful oriole. I shall  be glad if he will build his nest on our trees.'\"    So the hornet is now an oriole, a bird that is loved by every one. His  nest looks like that of a hornet because he learned how to build his  home before he became an oriole.          WHY THE PEACOCK'S TAIL HAS A HUNDRED EYES.      Juno, queen of the gods, had the fairest cow that any one ever saw. She  was creamy white, and her eyes were of as soft and bright a blue as  those of any maiden in the world. Juno and the king of the gods often  played tricks on each other, and Juno knew well that the king would try  to get her cow. There was a watchman named Argus, and one would think  that he could see all that was going on in the world, for he had a  hundred eyes, and no one had ever seen them all asleep at once, so Queen  Juno gave to Argus the work of watching the white cow.    The king of the gods knew what she had done, and he laughed to himself  and said, \"I will play a trick on Juno, and I will have the white cow.\"  He sent for Mercury and whispered in his ear, \"Mercury, go to the green  field where Argus watches the cream-white cow and get her for me.\"    Mercury was always happy when he could play a trick on any one, and he  set out gladly for the field where Argus watched the cream-white cow  with every one of his hundred eyes.    Now Mercury could tell merry stories of all that was done in the world.  He could sing, too, and the music of his voice had lulled many a god to  sleep. Argus knew that, but he had been alone a long time, and he  thought, \"What harm is there in listening to his merry chatter? I have a  hundred eyes, and even if half of them were asleep, the others could  easily keep watch of one cow.\" So he gladly hailed Mercury and said, \"I  have been alone in this field a long, long time, but you have roamed  about as you would. Will you not sing to me, and tell me what has  happened in the world? You would be glad to hear stories and music if  you had nothing to do but watch a cow, even if it was the cow of a  queen.\"    So Mercury sang and told stories. Some of the songs were merry, and some  were sad. The watchman closed one eye, then another and another, but  there were two eyes that would not close for all the sad songs and all  the merry ones. Then Mercury drew forth a hollow reed that he had  brought from the river and began to play on it. It was a magic reed, and  as he played, one could hear the water rippling gently on the shore and  the breath of the wind in the pine-trees; one could see the lilies  bending their heads as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22430"],[0,"Evolution in Modern Thought (#8)"],[1,"pieces of presumptive evidence a particularly weighty one  seems to me to be _the smallness of the steps of progress_ which we  can observe in certain cases, as for instance in leaf-imitation among  butterflies, and in mimicry generally. The resemblance to a leaf, for  instance of a particular Kallima, seems to us so close as to be  deceptive, and yet we find in another individual, or it may be in many  others, a spot added which increases the resemblance, and which could  not have become fixed unless the increased deceptiveness so produced  had frequently led to the overlooking of its much persecuted  possessor. But if we take the selection-value of the initial stages  for granted, we are confronted with the further question which I  myself formulated many years ago: How does it happen _that the  necessary beginnings of a useful variation are always present_? How  could insects which live upon or among green leaves become all green,  while those that live on bark become brown? How have the desert  animals become yellow and the Arctic animals white? Why were the  necessary variations always present? How could the green locust lay  brown eggs, or the privet caterpillar develop white and lilac-coloured  lines on its green skin?    It is of no use answering to this that the question is wrongly  formulated[37] and that it is the converse that is true; that the  process of selection takes place in accordance with the variations  that present themselves. This proposition is undeniably true, but so  also is another, which apparently negatives it: the variation required  has in the majority of cases actually presented itself. Selection  cannot solve this contradiction; it does not call forth the useful  variation, but simply works upon it. The ultimate reason why one and  the same insect should occur in green and in brown, as often happens  in caterpillars and locusts, lies in the fact that variations towards  brown presented themselves, and so also did variations towards green:  _the kernel of the riddle lies in the varying_, and for the present we  can only say, that small variations in different directions present  themselves in every species. Otherwise so many different kinds of  variations could not have arisen. I have endeavoured to explain this  remarkable fact by means of the intimate processes that must take  place within the germ-plasm, and I shall return to the problem when  dealing with \"germinal selection.\"    We have, however, to make still greater demands on variation, for it  is not enough that the necessary variation should occur in isolated  individuals, because in that case there would be small prospect of its  being preserved, notwithstanding its utility. Darwin at first  believed, that even single variations might lead to transformation of  the species, but later he became convinced that this was impossible,  at least without the cooeperation of other factors, such as isolation  and sexual selection.    In the case of the _green caterpillars with bright longitudinal  stripes_, numerous individuals exhibiting this useful variation must  have been produced to start with. In all higher, that is,  multicellular organisms, the germ-substance is the source of all  transmissible variations, and this germ-plasm is not a simple  substance but is made up of many primary constituents. The question  can therefore be more precisely stated thus: How does it come about  that in so many cases the useful variations present themselves in  numbers just where they are required, the white oblique lines in the  leaf-caterpillar on the under surface of the body, the accompanying  coloured stripes just above them? And, further, how has it come about  that in grass caterpillars, not oblique but longitudinal stripes,  which are more effective for concealment among grass and plants, have  been evolved? And finally, how is it that the same Hawk-moth  caterpillars, which to-day show oblique stripes, possessed  longitudinal stripes in Tertiary times? We can read this fact from the  history of their development, and I have before attempted to show the  biological significance of this change of colour.[38]    For the present I need only draw the conclusion that one and the same  caterpillar may exhibit the initial stages of both, and that it  depends on the manner in which these marking elements are  _intensified_ and _combined_ by natural selection whether whitish  longitudinal or oblique stripes should result. In this case then the  \"useful variations\" were actually \"always there,\" and we see that in  the same group of Lepidoptera, e.g. species of Sphingidae, evolution  has occurred in both directions according to whether the form lived  among grass or on broad leaves with oblique lateral veins, and we can  observe even now that the species with oblique stripes have  longitudinal stripes when young, that is to say, while the stripes  have no biological significance. The white places in the skin which  gave rise, probably first as small spots, to this protective marking  could be combined in one way or another according to the requirements  of the species. They must therefore either have possessed  selection-value from the first, or, if this was not the case at their  earliest occurrence, there must have been _some other factors_ which  raised them to the point of selection-value. I shall return to this in  discussing germinal selection. But the case may be followed still  farther, and leads us to the same alternative on a still more secure  basis.    Many years ago I observed in caterpillars of _Smerinthus populi_ (the  poplar hawk-moth), which also possess white oblique stripes, that  certain individuals showed _red spots_ above these stripes; these  spots occurred only on certain segments, and never flowed together to  form continuous stripes. In another species (_Smerinthus tiliae_)  similar blood-red spots unite to form a line-like coloured seam in the  last stage of larval life, while in _S. ocellata_ rust-red spots  appear in individual caterpillars, but more rarely than in _S.  populi_, and they show no tendency to flow together.    Thus we have here the origin of a new character, arising from small  beginnings, at least in _S. tiliae_, in which species the coloured  stripes are a normal specific character. In the other species, _S.  populi_ and _S. ocellata_, we find the beginnings of the same  variation, in one more rarely than in the other, and we can imagine  that, in the course of time, in these two species, coloured lines over  the oblique stripes will arise. In any case these spots are the  elements of variation, out of which coloured lines _may_ be evolved,  if they are combined in this direction through the agency of natural  selection. In _S. populi_ the spots are often small, but sometimes it  seems as though several had united to form large spots. Whether a  process of selection in this direction will arise in _S. populi_ and  _S. ocellata_, or whether it is now going on cannot be determined,  since we cannot tell in advance what biological value the marking  might have for these two species. It is conceivable that the spots may  have no selection-value as far as these species are concerned, and may  therefore disappear again in the course of phylogeny, or, on the other  hand, that they may be changed in another direction, for instance  towards imitation of the rust-red fungoid patches on poplar and willow  leaves. In any case we may regard the smallest spots as the initial  stages of variation, the larger as a cumulative summation of these.  Therefore either these initial stages must already possess  selection-value, or, as I said before: _There must be some other  reason for their cumulative summation_. I should like to give one more  example, in which we can infer, though we cannot directly observe, the  initial stages.    All the Holothurians or sea-cucumbers have in the skin calcereous  bodies of different forms, usually thick and irregular, which make the  skin tough and resistant. In a small group of them--the species of  Synapta--the calcareous bodies occur in the form of delicate anchors  of microscopic size. Up till 1897 these anchors, like many other  delicate microscopic structures, were regarded as curiosities, as  natural marvels. But a Swedish observer, Oestergren, has recently  shown that they have a biological significance: they serve the  footless Synapta as auxiliary organs of locomotion, since, when the  body swells up in the act of creeping, they press firmly with their  tips, which are embedded in the skin, against the substratum on which  the animal creeps, and thus prevent slipping backwards. In other  Holothurians this slipping is made impossible by the fixing of the  tube-feet. The anchors act automatically, sinking their tips towards  the ground when the corresponding part of the body thickens, and  returning to the original position at an angle of 45 degrees to the  upper surface when the part becomes thin again. The arms of the anchor  do not lie in the same plane as the shaft, and thus the curve of the  arms forms the outermost part of the anchor, and offers no further  resistance to the gliding of the animal. Every detail of the anchor,  the curved portion, the little teeth at the head, the arms, etc., can  be interpreted in the most beautiful way, above all the form of the  anchor itself, for the two arms prevent it from swaying round to the  side. The position of the anchors, too, is definite and significant;  they lie obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the animal, and  therefore they act alike whether the animal is creeping backwards or  forwards. Moreover, the tips would pierce through the skin if the  anchors lay in the longitudinal direction. Synapta burrows in the  sand; it first pushes in the thin anterior end, and thickens this  again, thus enlarging the hole, then the anterior tentacles displace  more sand, the body is worked in a little farther, and the"]]]
