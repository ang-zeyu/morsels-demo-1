Baker:    \"The most remarkable case on the subject that now occurs to my memory,  is that of Lord Ashburnham's family, in Sussex; to which, spring water  was supplied, from a considerable distance, in leaden pipes. In  consequence, his Lordship's servants were every year tormented with  colic, and some of them died. An eminent physician, of Battle, who  corresponded with me on the subject, sent up some gallons of that water,  which were analysed by Dr. Higgins, who reported that the water had  contained more than the common quantity of carbonic acid; and that he  found in it lead in solution, which he attributed to the carbonic acid.  In consequence of this, Lord Ashburnham substituted wooden for leaden  pipes; and from that time his family have had no particular complaints  in their bowels.\"    _Richmond, Sept. 27, 1802._      METHOD OF DETECTING LEAD, WHEN CONTAINED IN WATER.    One of the most delicate tests for detecting lead, is water impregnated  with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which instantly imparts to the fluid  containing the minutest quantity of lead, a brown or blackish tinge.    This test is so delicate that distilled water, when condensed by a  leaden pipe in a still tub, is affected by it. To shew the action of  this test, the following experiments will serve.      EXPERIMENT.    Pour into a wine-glass containing distilled water, an equal quantity of  water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas: no change will take  place; but if a 1/4 of a grain of acetate of lead (sugar of lead of  commerce), or any other preparation of lead, be added, the mixture will  instantly turn brown and dark-coloured.    To apply this test, one part of the suspected water need merely to be  mingled with a like quantity of water impregnated with sulphuretted  hydrogen. Or better, a larger quantity, a gallon for example, of the  water may be concentrated by evaporation to about half a pint, and then  submitted to the action of the test.    Another and more efficient mode of applying this test, is, to pass a  current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the suspected water in the  following manner.      EXPERIMENT.    [Illustration]    Take a bottle (_a_) or Florence flask, adapt to the mouth of it a cork  furnished with a glass tube (_b_), bent at right angles; let one leg of  the tube be immersed in the vial (_c_) containing the water to be  examined; as shewn in the following sketch. Then take one part of  sulphuret of antimony of commerce, break it into pieces of half the size  of split pease, put it into the flask, and pour upon it four parts of  common concentrated muriatic acid (spirit of salt of commerce).  Sulphuretted hydrogen gas will become disengaged from the materials in  abundance, and pass through the water in the vial (_c_). Let the  extrication of the gas be continued for about five minutes; and if the  minutest quantity of lead be present, the water will acquire a  dark-brown or blackish tinge. The extrication of the gas is facilitated  by the application of a gentle heat.    The action of the sulphuretted hydrogen test, when applied in this  manner, is astonishingly great; for one part of acetate of lead may be  detected by means of it, in 20000 parts of water.[24]    Another test for readily detecting lead in water, is sulphuretted  chyazate of potash, first pointed out as such by Mr. Porret. A few drops  of this re-agent, added to water containing lead, occasion a white  precipitate, consisting of small brilliant scales of a considerable  lustre.    Sulphate of potash, or sulphate of soda, is likewise a very delicate  test for detecting minute portions of lead. Dr. Thomson[25] discovered,  by means of it, one part of lead in 100000 parts of water; and this  acute Philosopher considers it as the most unequivocal test of lead that  we possess. Dr. Thomson remarks that \"no other precipitate can well be  confounded with it, except sulphate of barytes; and there is no  probability of the presence of barytes existing in common water.\"    Carbonate of potash, or carbonate of soda, may also be used as agents to  detect the presence of lead. By means of these salts Dr. Thomson was  enabled to detect the presence of a smaller quantity of lead in  distilled water, than by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen. But the  reader must here be told, that the use of these tests cannot be  entrusted to an unskilful hand; because the alkaline carbonates throw  down also lime and magnesia, two substances which are frequently found  in common water; the former tests, namely, water impregnated with  sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and nascent sulphuretted hydrogen, are  therefore preferable.    It is absolutely essential that the water impregnated with sulphuretted  hydrogen, when employed as a test for detecting very minute quantities  of lead, be fresh prepared; and if sulphate of potash, or sulphate of  soda, be used as tests, they should be perfectly pure. Sulphate of  potash is preferable to sulphate of soda. It is likewise advisable to  act with these tests upon water concentrated by boiling. The water to  which the test has been added does sometimes appear not to undergo any  change, at first; it is therefore necessary to suffer the mixture to  stand for a few hours; after which time the action of the test will be  more evident. Mr. Silvester[26] has proposed gallic acid as a delicate  test for detecting lead.      FOOTNOTES:    [11] Dalton, Manchester Memoirs, vol. iv. p. 55.    [12] Marsden's History of Sumatra.

The application of the sulphuretted hydrogen test requires some  precautions in those cases where other metals besides lead may be  expected; because silver, quicksilver, tin, copper, and several other  metals, are affected by it, as well as lead; but there is no chance of  these metals being met with in common water.--See _Chemical Tests_,  third edition, p. 207.

All  persons moderately conversant with the subject, are aware, that a  portion of alum is added to young and meagre red wines, for the purpose  of brightening their colour; that Brazil wood, or the husks of  elderberries and bilberries,[27] are employed to impart a deep rich  purple tint to red Port of a pale, faint colour; that gypsum is used to  render cloudy white wines transparent;[28] that an additional  astringency is imparted to immature red wines by means of oak-wood  sawdust,[29] and the husks of filberts; and that a mixture of spoiled  foreign and home-made wines is converted into the wretched compound  frequently sold in this town by the name of _genuine old Port_.    Various expedients are resorted to for the purpose of communicating  particular flavours to insipid wines. Thus a _nutty_ flavour is produced  by bitter almonds; factitious Port wine is flavoured with a tincture  drawn from the seeds of raisins; and the ingredients employed to form  the _bouquet_ of high-flavoured wines, are sweet-brier, oris-root,  clary, cherry laurel water, and elder-flowers.    The flavouring ingredients used by manufacturers, may all be purchased  by those dealers in wine who are initiated in the mysteries of the  trade; and even a manuscript recipe book for preparing them, and the  whole mystery of managing all sorts of wines, may be obtained on payment  of a considerable fee.    The sophistication of wine with substances not absolutely noxious to  health, is carried to an enormous extent in this metropolis. Many  thousand pipes of spoiled cyder are annually brought hither from the  country, for the purpose of being converted into factitious Port wine.  The art of manufacturing spurious wine is a regular trade of great  extent in this metropolis.    \"There is, in this city, a certain fraternity of chemical operators, who  work underground in holes, caverns, and dark retirements, to conceal  their mysteries from the eyes and observation of mankind. These  subterraneous philosophers are daily employed in the transmutation of  liquors; and by the power of magical drugs and incantations, raising  under the streets of London the choicest products of the hills and  valleys of France. They can squeeze Bourdeaux out of the sloe, and draw  Champagne from an apple.

The outstanding  personalities of the time were patriots, soldiers, politicians, not a  dreamer among them.    England was so nonchalantly free already, that the betting-book at  White's Club records that, \"Lord Glengall bets Lord Yarmouth one  hundred guineas to five that Buonaparte returns to Paris before Beau  Brummel returns to London!\" Burke and Pitt, and Fox and North, and  Canning might look after politics; Hargreaves and Crompton would take  care to keep English industries to the fore, and Watt, and the great  canal-builder Brindley, would solve the problem of distributing coal;  their lordships cracked their plovers' eggs, unable to pronounce even  the name of a single German town or philosopher, and showed their  impartial interest, much as now they do, in contemporary history, by  backing their opinions with guineas, with the odds on Caesar against  the \"Beau.\"    Weimar was a sunny little corner where poetry and philosophy and  literature were hatched, well out of reach of the political storms of  the time. The Grand Duke of Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach with his tiny  court, his Falstaffian army, his mint and his customs-houses, with his  well-conducted theatre and his suite of litterateurs, was one of three  hundred rulers in the Germany of that time.    The Holy Roman Empire, consisting, in Napoleon's time, of Austria,  Prussia, and a mass of minor states, these last grouped together under  the name of the Confederation of the Rhine, and wholly under French  influence, lasted one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight years, or  from Caesar's victory of Pharsalia down to August the 1st, 1806, when  Napoleon announced to the Diet that he no longer recognized it.    This institution had no political power, was merely a theoretical  political ring for the theoretical political conflicts of German  agitators and dreamers, and was composed of the representatives of  this tangle of powerless, but vain and self-conscious little states.  This Holy Roman Empire, with an Austrian at its head, and aided by  France, strove to prevent the development of a strong German state  under the leadership of Prussia. After Napoleon's day it became a  struggle between Prussia and Austria. Austria had only eight out of  thirty-six million German population, while Prussia was practically  entirely German, and Prussia used her army, politics, and commerce to  gain control in Germany. Even to-day Austria-Hungary contains the most  varied conglomeration of races of any nation in the world. Austria has  26,000,000 inhabitants, of whom 9,000,000 are Germans, 1,000,000  Italians and Rumanians, 6,000,000 Bohemians and Slovacs, 8,000,000  Poles and Ruthenians, 2,000,000 Slovenes and Croatians. Of the  19,000,000 of Hungary there are 9,000,000 Magyars, 2,000,000 Germans,  2,500,000 Slovacs and Ruthenians, 3,000,000 Rumanians, and nearly  3,000,000 Southern Slays.    Weimar was one of the three hundred capitals of this limp empire, with  tariffs, stamps, coins, uniforms, customs, gossip, interests, and a  sovereign of its own. When Bismarck undertook the unifying of the  customs tariffs of Germany, there were even then fifteen hundred  different tariffs in existence!    Weimar had its salon, its notables: Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, Frau  von Stein, Dr. Zimmermann as a valued correspondent; its Grand Duke  Karl August and his consort; Herder, who jealous of the renown of  Goethe, and piqued at the insufficient consideration he received, soon  departed, to return only when the Grand Duchess took him under her  wing and thus satisfied his morbid pride; its love affair, for did not  the beautiful Frau von Werthern leave her husband, carry out a mock  funeral, and, heralded as dead, elope to Africa with Herr von  Einsiedel? But Weimar was as far away from what we now agree to look  upon as the great events of the day, as were Lords Glengall and  Yarmouth at White's, in Saint James's.    It requires imagination to put Goethe and Schiller and Wieland in the  bow window at White's, and to place Lords Glengall and Yarmouth in  Frau von Stein's drawing-room in Weimar; but the discerning eye which  can see this picture, knows at a glance why England misunderstands  Germany and Germany misunderstands England. For White's is White's and  Weimar is Weimar, and one is British and one is German as much now as  then! In the one the winner of the Derby is of more importance than  any philosopher; in the other, philosophers, poets, professors, and  playwrights are almost as well known, as the pedigrees of the  yearlings to be sold at Newmarket, are known at White's. They still  have plover's eggs early in the season at White's, and they still  recognize the subtle distinction there between \"port wine\" and \"port\";  while in Weimar nobody, unless it be the duke, even boils his  sauerkraut in white wine!    One could easily write a chapter on Weimar and its self-satisfied  social and literary activities. There were three hundred or more  capitals of like complexion and isolation: some larger, some smaller,  none perhaps with such a splendid literary setting, but all  indifferent with the indifference of distant relatives who seldom see  one another, when the French Revolution exploded its bomb at the gates  of the world's habits of thought.    No intelligent man ever objected to the French Revolution because it  stood for human rights, but because it led straight to human wrongs.  The dream was angelic, but the nightmare in which it ended was  devilish. The French Revolution was the most colossal disappointment  that humanity has ever had to bear.    More than the demagogue gives us credit for, are the great majority of  us eager to help our neighbors. The trouble is that the demagogue  thinks this, the most difficult of all things, an easy task. God and  Nature are harsh when they are training men, and we, alas, are soft,  hence most of our failures. Correction must be given with a rod, not  with a sop. There lies all the trouble.    The political and philanthropic wise men were setting out for the  manger and the babe, their eyes on the star, laden with gifts, when  they were met by a whiff of grape-shot from the guns commanded by a  young Corsican genius. The French Revolution found us all sympathetic,  but making men of equal height by lopping off their heads; making them  free by giving no one a chance to be free; making them fraternal by  insisting that all should be addressed by the same title of,  \"citizen,\" was soon seen to be the method of a political nursery.    It was no fault of the French Revolution that it was no revolution at  all, in any political sense. Men maddened by oppression hit, kick,  bite, and burn. They are satisfied to shake the burden of the moment  off their backs, even though the burden they take on be of much the  same character. \"It is perfectly possible, to revive even in our own  day the fiscal tyranny which once left even European populations in  doubt whether it was worth while preserving life by thrift and toil.  You have only to tempt a portion of the population into temporary  idleness, by promising them a share in a fictitious hoard lying in an  imaginary strong-box which is supposed to contain all human wealth.  You have only to take the heart out of those who would willingly labor  and save, by taxing them ad misericordiam for the most laudable  philanthropic objects. For it makes not the smallest difference to the  motives of the thrifty and industrious part of mankind whether their  fiscal oppressor be an Eastern despot, or a feudal baron, or a  democratic legislature, and whether they are taxed for the benefit of  a corporation called Society or for the advantage of an individual  styled King or Lord,\" writes Sir Henry Maine. In short it matters not  in the least what you baptize oppression, so long as it is oppression,  or whether you call your tyrant \"Jim\" or \"My Lord,\" so long as he is a  tyrant. Many people are slowly awakening to the fact in England and in  America, that plain citizen \"Jim\" can be a most merciless tyrant in  spite of his unpretentious name and title. No royal tyrant ever dared  to attempt to gain his ends by dynamiting innocent people, as did the  trades-unionists at Los Angeles, or to starve a whole population as  did the trades-unionists in London. We have not escaped tyranny by  changing its name. The idea of the Contrat Social and of all its  dilutions since, has been that individuals go to make up society, and  that society under the name of the state must take charge of those  individuals. The French Revolution was a failure because it fell back  upon that tiresome and futile philosophy of government which had been  that of Louis XIV. Louis XIV took care of the individual units of the  state by exploiting them. He was a sound enough Socialist in theory.  France gained nothing of much value along the lines of political  philosophy.    Whether it is Louis XIV who says \"l'etat c'est moi\" or the citizens  banded together in a state, who claim that the functions of the state  are to meddle with the business of every man, matters little. It is  the same socialistic philosophy at bottom, and it has produced to-day  a France of thirty-eight millions of people pledged to sterility, one  million of whom are state officials superintending the affairs of the  others at a cost, in salaries alone, of upward of five hundred million  dollars a year.    In no political or philosophical sense was the French Revolution a  revolution at all. It was a change of administration and leaders, but  not a change of political theory. The French Revolution put the state  in impartial supremacy over all classes by destroying exemptions  claimed by the nobility and the clergy, and thus extended the power of  the state. The English Revolution without bloodshed reduced the power  of the state, not for the advantage of any class, but for individual  liberty and local self-govern"]]]
