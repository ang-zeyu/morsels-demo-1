Avoid such sentences as the following:--    \"He had good reason _to believe_ that the delay was not _an accident_  (accidental) but _premeditated_, and _for supposing_ (to suppose, or  else, for believing, above) that the fort, though strong both _by art_  and _naturally_ (nature), would be forced by the _treachery of the_  governor and the _indolent_ (indolence of the) general to capitulate  within a week.\"    \"They accused him of being _bribed_ (receiving bribes from) by the  king and _unwilling_ (neglecting) to take the city.\"      *41. Antithesis adds force, and often clearness.*--The meaning of  _liberal_ in the following sentence is ascertained by the  antithesis:--    \"All the pleasing illusions which made _power_(a) _gentle_(b) and  _obedience_(a') _liberal_(b') ... are now to be destroyed.\"    There is a kind of proportion. As _gentleness_ is to _power_, so  _liberality_ (in the sense here used) is to _obedience_. Now  _gentleness_ is the check on the excess of power; therefore _liberal_  here applies to that which checks the excess of obedience, _i.e._  checks servility. Hence _liberal_ here means \"free.\"    The contrast also adds force. \"They aimed at the _rule_(a), not at the  _destruction_(a'), of their country. They were men of great _civil_(b)  and great _military_(b') talents, and, if the _terror_(c), the  _ornament_(c') of their age.\"    Excessive antithesis is unnatural and wearisome:--    \"Who can persuade where _treason_(a) is above _reason_(a'), and  _might_(b) ruleth _right_(b'), and it is had for _lawful_(c)  whatsoever is _lustful_(c'), and _commotioners_(d) are better than  _commissioners_(d'), and _common woe_(e) is named common  _wealth_(e')?\"    *42. Epigram.*--It has been seen that the neglect of climax results in  lameness. Sometimes the suddenness of the descent produces amusement:  and when the descent is intentional and very sudden, the effect is  striking as well as amusing. Thus:--    (1) \"You are not only not vicious, you are virtuous,\" is a _climax_.    (2) \"You are not vicious, you are vice,\" is not _climax_, nor is it  _bathos_: it is _epigram_.[15]    Epigram may be defined as a \"short sentence expressing truth under an  amusing appearance of incongruity.\" It is often antithetical.      \"The Russian grandees came to { and diamonds,\" _climax_.       court dropping pearls      { and vermin,\" _epigram_.      \"These two nations were divided  { and the bitter remembrance       by mutual fear                { of recent losses,\" _climax_.                                     { and mountains,\" _epigram_.    There is a sort of implied antithesis in:--    \"He is full of information--(but flat also) like yesterday's _Times_.\"    \"Verbosity is cured (not by a small, but) by a large vocabulary.\"    The name of epigram may sometimes be given to a mere antithesis;  _e.g._ \"An educated man should know something of everything, and  everything of something.\"      *43. Let each sentence have one, and only one, principal subject of  thought.*    \"This great and good man died on the 17th of September, 1683, leaving  behind him the memory of many noble actions, and a numerous family, of  whom three were sons; one of them, George, the eldest, heir to his  father's virtues, as well as to his principal estates in Cumberland,  where most of his father's property was situate, and shortly  afterwards elected member for the county, which had for several  generations returned this family to serve in Parliament.\" Here we have  (1) the \"great and good man,\" (2) \"George,\" (3) \"the county,\"  disputing which is to be considered the principal subject. Two, if not  three sentences should have been made, instead of one. Carefully avoid  a long sentence like this, treating of many different subjects on one  level. It is called _heterogeneous_.      *44. The connection between different sentences must be kept up by  Adverbs used as Conjunctions, or by means of some other connecting  words at the beginning of each sentence.*--Leave out the conjunctions  and other connecting words, and it will be seen that the following  sentences lose much of their meaning:--    \"Pitt was in the army for a few months in time of peace. His  biographer (_accordingly_) insists on our confessing, that, if the  young cornet had remained in the service, he would have been one of  the ablest commanders that ever lived. (_But_) this is not all. Pitt  (, _it seems_,) was not merely a great poet _in esse_ and a great  general _in posse_, but a finished example of moral excellence....  (_The truth is, that_) there scarcely ever lived a person who had so  little claim to this sort of praise as Pitt. He was (_undoubtedly_) a  great man. (_But_) his was not a complete and well-proportioned  greatness. The public life of Hampden or of Somers resembles a regular  drama which can be criticised as a whole, and every scene of which is  to be viewed in connection with the main action. The public life of  Pitt (, _on the other hand_,) is,\" &c.    The following are some of the most common connecting adverbs, or  connecting phrases: (1) expressing consequence, similarity,  repetition, or resumption of a subject--_accordingly_, _therefore_,  _then_, _naturally_, _so that_, _thus_, _in this way_, _again_, _once  more_, _to resume_, _to continue_, _to sum up_, _in fact_, _upon  this_; (2) expressing opposition--_nevertheless_, _in spite of this_,  _yet_, _still_, _however_, _but_, _on the contrary_, _on the other  hand_; (3) expressing suspension--_undoubtedly ... but_; _indeed ...  yet_; _on the one hand ... on the other_; _partly ... partly_; _some  ... others_.    Avoid a style like that of Bishop Burnet, which strings together a  number of sentences with \"and\" or \"so,\" or with no conjunction at all:    \"Blake with the fleet happened to be at Malaga, before he made war  upon Spain; _and_ some of his seamen went ashore, _and_ met the Host  carried about; _and_ not only paid no respect to it, but laughed at  those who did.\" Write \"_When_ Blake &c.\"      *45. The connection between two long sentences sometimes requires a  short intervening sentence, showing the transition of thought.*    \"Without force or opposition, it (chivalry) subdued the fierceness of  pride and power; it obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft  collar[16] of social esteem, compelled stern authority to submit to  elegance, and gave a dominating vanquisher of laws to be subdued by  manners. But now (_all is to be changed_:) all the pleasing illusions  which made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the  different shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation,  incorporated into politics the sentiments that beautify and soften  private society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of  light and reason.\" If the words italicized were omitted, the  transition would be too abrupt: the conjunction _but_ alone would be  insufficient.      FOOTNOTES:    [5] _For_, at the beginning of a sentence, sometimes causes temporary  doubt, while the reader is finding out whether it is used as a  conjunction or preposition.    [6] _It_ should refer (1) either to the Noun immediately preceding, or  (2) to some Noun superior to all intervening Nouns in emphasis. See  (25).    [7] So useful that, on mature consideration, I am disposed to adopt  \"that\" here and in several of the following exceptional cases.    [8] Of course \"and which\" may be used where \"which\" precedes.    [9] \"That which,\" where _that_ is an _object_, _e.g._ \"then (set  forth) _that which_ is worse,\" _St. John_ ii. 10, is rare in modern  English.    [10] Sometimes the emphatic Adverb comes at the beginning, and causes  the transposition of an Auxiliary Verb, \"_Gladly_ do I consent.\"    [11] Of course punctuation will remove the ambiguity; but it is better  to express oneself clearly, as far as possible, independently of  punctuation.    [12] Professor Bain.    [13] See (30).    [14] The repetition of Auxiliary Verbs and Pronominal Adjectives is  also conducive to clearness.    [15] Professor Bain says: \"In the epigram the mind is roused by a  conflict or contradiction between the form of the language and the  meaning really conveyed.\"    [16] This metaphor is not recommended for imitation.             *       *       *       *       *      BREVITY.    *46. Metaphor is briefer than literal statement.* See (13).    \"The cares and responsibilities of a sovereign often disturb his  sleep,\" is not so brief as \"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,\"  where the effect of care on the mind is assimilated to the effect of a  heavy crown pressing on the head.      *47. General terms are briefer, though less forcible, than particular  terms.* Thus: \"He devours _literature_, no matter of what kind,\" is  shorter than, \"Novels or sermons, poems or histories, no matter what,  he devours them all.\"    *47 a. A phrase may be expressed by a word.*    \"These impressions _can never be forgotten_, i.e. are _indelible_.\"    \"The style of this book is _of such a nature that it cannot be  understood_, i.e. _unintelligible_.\"    The words \"of such a nature that\" are often unnecessarily inserted.  See the extract from Sir Archibald Alison.      *48. Participles can often be used as brief (though sometimes  ambiguous) equivalents of phrases containing Conjunctions and Verbs.*    \"Hearing (when he heard) this, he advanced.\" See (7) for more  instances. So \"phrases _containing_ conjunctions\" means \"phrases _that  contain_ conjunctions.\" \"_This done_, (for, _when this was done_) he  retired.\"    Sometimes the participle \"being\" is omitted. \"France at our doors, he  sees no danger nigh,\" for \"France being\" or \"though France is.\"      *49. Participles and participial adjectives may be used like  Adjectives, as equivalents for phrases containing the Relative.*    \"The never-_ceasing_ wind,\" \"the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22605"],[0,"Book-Lovers, Bibliomaniacs and Book Clubs (#8)"],[1,"able to appreciate the amount of gratuitous labor  performed by the officers and committees of private book clubs. It is  erroneous to suppose that beautiful books are a purely natural  offspring of the book club. The preparation of the material for  publication and successfully following it through all the various  stages of manufacture requires an enormous amount of detail work, as  well as an accurate knowledge of bookmaking. The president of a  prominent book club recently said, in his annual address to the  members:--    \"I wish that our members could be witnesses at the many conferences  held by the Committee on Publications and by the Council; of the  various experiments needed to settle upon the size and shape of the  book, the size of its page and its margins, the style of type, the  initial letters, head-bands, tail-pieces, engravings, etc. etc.; of  the printer's endless proofs, the making of a special paper (which  sometimes proves to be unsuited), and, finally, the style of binding.  What material, color, and general make-up shall it have? If our  members could thus follow the progress of the work from beginning to  finish they would be reconciled to disappointment. At any rate it is  through their subscriptions that these experiments can be undertaken,  and it is by knowledge thus gained that the Club has won credit for  the Arts and Crafts of our country, and made an honorable record even  in other lands; so that to be a member of the Club has become an  enviable distinction.\"    Owing to the tricks and stratagem practiced in _manufacturing_ \"de  luxe\" editions, some of our bibliophiles have taken matters of  bookmaking into their own hands, with the result that they have  organized clubs and societies, the members of which take much pleasure  in introducing to their library companions each year one or two  charming new acquaintances which come bearing the club's seal of  endorsement. A true bibliophile always feels a just pride in shelving  one of these book-treasures of his own club's production, and  thereafter displaying it before his friends, with the interesting bit  of information that \"This is the latest production of _our Club_; it  is issued _only for members_.\" For obviously an owner's interest in  any work is increased many fold by the fact that he is a constituent  part of the organization which produced the same: the relationship to  the book in such a case is akin to the love of a parent for a child;  and the owner of a fine library will not unusually regard his Club  publications and privately printed books as the objects therein which  are entitled to his fondest consideration.    I have recently taken occasion to examine with considerable care the  latest publications of the leading book clubs of this country, and to  compare them with some of the first issues of these same clubs. The  improvement in the later productions over the earlier ones astonished  me. There were as good artists, editors, binders, type, paper, ink,  and other accessories twenty years ago as we have now, and indeed it  is doubtful if our modern printing presses show much improvement in  the quality of work during that time; but it would seem that  persistent effort along the lines of experimental work has been  generously rewarded by a steady improvement in the general results now  attained. Nor is the situation injured by a slight tinge of friendly  rivalry among clubs, to lend an additional zest to their labors, and  to whet the praiseworthy ambition of each to make every succeeding  issue a little better than the last. There are many zealous  bibliophiles who belong to two or three book clubs at once, finding it  interesting to collect and compare the works produced by the several  clubs.    Many of our great scholars as well as leading publishers are members  of these book clubs, and serve on the councils and various committees;  so it must not be supposed by skeptics that their publications are in  the slightest degree amateurish. They employ the best talent and  materials; the councils and publication committees, as well, being  composed of persons of unquestioned integrity, who possess an  intelligent understanding of bookmaking.    Some of these clubs (particularly those whose membership is largely  local) have commodious quarters where the members may meet at all  times, whether to discuss matters of common business interest, to  exchange their latest jokes, or to generally discuss book-lore and  other congenial topics. The social features of some of the book clubs  are, however, reduced to the occasions of the annual meetings and  dinners. The \"Club-Room Question,\" in one of these organizations  having a membership of five hundred, distributed in one hundred and  sixty-seven cities and towns in this country and abroad, was recently  reported upon by the Council as follows:--        The question of providing and maintaining club rooms and      establishing a suitable library for the Society has been more      or less discussed since its incorporation. The Council has not      found that spacious and luxuriously furnished rooms are an      important requisite in accomplishing the expressed purpose and      limitations of the Society. These, according to Article I. of      the Constitution and By-laws, are to be \"the study and      promotion of the arts pertaining to fine bookmaking and      illustrating, and the occasional publication of specially      designed and illustrated books, for distribution among its      members at a minimum cost of production.\"        Then, too, while our membership is entirely homogeneous in      bibliomaniacal spirit, it is so scattered over such a vast      expanse of territory that only a small percentage of the      members would be able to enjoy club-room privileges; even      those within easy reach of such rooms would probably not      frequent them enough to justify any considerable expense in      maintenance. It would be necessary, also, to change the      present constitution (and to assess the members for annual      dues in order to meet current expenses), should the club-room      idea be carried out. This would be objectionable on various      grounds, and amongst these, because a non-resident member      might thus be paying an annual fee without receiving any      corresponding benefit in return; a condition in such case      which would be tantamount to his meeting an increased charge      each year for the privilege of subscribing and paying for the      Society's publications. Hence, the Council do not see their      way to entertaining or recommending the club-room feature. But      it is not supposed that the spirit of fellowship among our      bibliophiles--naturally related as they are by a kindred      interest--will in any degree suffer because of the lack of      such facilities. A personal contact, however agreeable, does      not seem essential. Certainly the many charming letters      received from members whom we have never seen, go far to      relieve the present lack in this regard, so far as the      officers are concerned.        As matters now stand, the Society has sufficiently comfortable      quarters in one of the offices of the Treasurer, where the      Council holds its meetings. These are found by experience to      be quite ample for all practical purposes and present needs.    Collectors of manuscripts and of unique copies often furnish the book  clubs with valuable and otherwise unprocurable material to be printed  for the members. Last year one collector alone furnished gratuitously  to a society of which he is a member, many thousands of dollars' worth  of unpublished manuscripts of interesting historical matter to be  printed exclusively for its members. In this way much valuable  material is preserved in print, when it would otherwise remain forever  unpublished and unobtainable.    During the past few years it has been my pleasant privilege to spend  many hours of each week in concurrent labor with the Council in the  preparation of the publications of The Bibliophile Society, in which  Council I have had the honor to serve continuously since its  organization.    There is no pleasure more delectable, no joy more inspiring than that  of devising books which prove a delight to the eye and a satisfaction  to the artistic tastes of those who are competent to appreciate the  qualities that should characterize a perfectly made book.    I now realize as never before why it is that our busiest men of  affairs, and scholars of renown, are actuated to serve so assiduously  in this labor of love; for surely no amount of effort, however  laborious, can be regarded as having been in any sense misguided or  wasted when it elicits such approbation as expressed in the following  letter from Charles A. Decker, Esq., a fellow member, of New York  City:--                                                    March 15th, 1904.        MR. H. H. HARPER, Treasurer,        The Bibliophile Society,          Colonial Building, Boston, Mass.        DEAR MR. HARPER:--        My stock of superlatives is insufficient to adequately express      my appreciation of \"Andre's Journal.\" Keats must have had a      psychic sense which enabled him to see the latest issue by our      Society, and he had this in view when he wrote the opening      line of _Endymion_. (Is n't \"A thing of beauty,\" &c., the      opening line?) Such books as the Council has planned are an      education to bibliophiles; the work is progressive, for each      issue is finer than the one which preceded it. Can any book be      finer than \"Andre's Journal\"? If so, I can't conceive it. Such      noble types, the pages so perfectly balanced; the margins so      broad; the paper of such beautiful texture; the ink so      brilliantly black; the maps so marvelously reproduced; the      etchings so artistically conceived and executed and the title      page so beautifully engraved;"]]]
