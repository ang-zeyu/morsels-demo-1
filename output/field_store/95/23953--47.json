However, it does not seem to him  likely that the French will really come here, and it was only because he  considered that it was just possible they might do so that he himself  suggested that I should come over and stay here until to-morrow  afternoon, lest, if we should have to leave suddenly, you might not  think that we had forgotten you in our haste to be off. For myself, I  wish that I could stay here. I suppose that if the French came you would  fight, and I could fight with your tribe?\"    \"Assuredly we will fight,\" the sheik said. \"Why should these Franks come  here to molest us? I love not the Turkish rule much, but we are in no  way molested. Assuredly every Arab through the desert will ride against  them and aid the Mamelukes to drive them into the sea. How great an army  would they bring against us?\"    \"We hear from the officers of our fleet that the news received in  England said that some 30,000 men were preparing to embark for some  unknown destination.\"    \"Thirty thousand!\" the sheik said scornfully; \"why, there are 10,000  Mameluke cavalry and fully 20,000 infantry, janizaries, and spahis,  besides the levy of the whole population, and the desert tribes can put  5000 horsemen into the field. They will never dare to come against us  unless with a force very much larger than you speak of. No, it is not  against Egypt that the expedition can have sailed.\"    \"That is what my father thinks,\" Edgar said; \"not because of the force  you could bring against them, but because they would know that they  might be cut off at any time from returning by our fleet, and their  position would then become desperate. We have long blockaded them in  their own ports, and if they are not strong enough to get out of these,  still less would they be able to leave Egypt.\"    \"Let us not talk more of them,\" the sheik said contemptuously. \"They are  dogs; if they come hither we shall know how to deal with them.\"          CHAPTER III.    LEFT BEHIND.      The sheik spoke a few words to two of his followers, who at once mounted  their horses and rode off.    \"They will bring us news if anything happens,\" he said; \"they will go  into Alexandria.\"    It was late in the evening when they returned.    \"You have news?\" the sheik said, as they came up to the fire by which he  was sitting. The moon was shining brightly, lighting up the wide expanse  of sand round the grove.    \"The Franks have come,\" one said.    Edgar sprung to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and alarm.    \"When did they come?\" the sheik asked.    \"When we reached the city all was quiet,\" the man said, \"except that  soldiers were working at the fortifications. When we asked why this was,  they said that some Bedouins had come in two hours before with the news  that the sea near Cape Harzet was covered with ships, and that they were  sailing this way. Many did not believe the story, but all the people and  the soldiers were ordered to work on the fortifications, to bring up  shot for the great guns, to carry stones to mend the walls where they  were broken, and to prepare for the defence. The sun was nigh half down  when we saw a great many white dots on the edge of the sea. They were  still some leagues away, when everyone pointed and cried out, 'It is the  enemy!' and worked harder than ever. It was not for two hours that we  were sure that they were ships. When we were so, we went, as you bade  us, to the English merchant's. He was busy directing men, who were going  backwards and forwards to a ship in the harbour. We said to him,  'Master, our sheik has sent us to carry him news should the fleet of the  Franks come here. He told us to come to you if it did so, as you might  wish to send for your son.'    \"'It is too late,' he said; 'too late for my son to come to me. I am on  the point of starting now, as you see. Many of the ships have already  put to sea, and the captain has sent to say that he cannot risk his  vessel by staying longer. The French will be here within two or three  hours, and although they will not venture to enter the harbour till  daybreak they could capture all vessels going out. Tell my son that I  regret much that I let him go away for the day, but had no thought that  the enemy would come so soon. Bid him not be uneasy about me, for it  will be dark in an hour, and the French will not be up until two hours  later, and they will have their hands full without trying to catch the  craft that are putting out from here. Here is a letter for him; I was  going to leave it here in case he returned.'    \"Five minutes afterwards he took his place in a boat and was rowed off  to the ship. We saw the men getting up the anchor, and then the sails  were spread, and she sailed out of the harbour. Then, not wishing to be  shut up in the town, we went out through the gates and rode to the  mound by the sea-shore that is called Marabout. Then we got off our  horses to see what would happen. It was dark when the Franks' vessels  came along; some of them sailed on towards the harbour, but most of them  anchored and let down their sails, and presently one could see vast  numbers of boats rowing towards the shore.\"    When the man had finished, Edgar opened the note that was handed to him.  It was written in pencil.         _My dear Edgar,--In face of all probabilities the French fleet is       in sight. They will be here soon after it is dark. The city is in a       state of mad excitement. The captain of the 'Petrel' has just come       in, saying that the French are coming along the coast from the       west, and that I must be on board before it is dark. For some       reasons I regret that you are not with me, but I believe that you       will be quite safe with your Arab friends, and possibly this may be       more to your liking than a long stay in London. Take care of       yourself, lad. God bless you!--Your affectionate father._    Edgar's first thought at hearing the news had been regret that he could  not accompany his father, but this was very speedily succeeded by a  feeling of delight that he would be enabled to witness stirring events.    \"Are you glad or sorry?\" the sheik asked.    \"I am much more glad than sorry,\" he replied. \"My father, no doubt, is  disappointed that I am not returning home with him. I should on no  account have remained behind had it been possible to join him in time.  As it is, it is neither my fault nor his, but, as I think, a stroke of  good fortune. And now, chief, I can accept your kind offer of  hospitality, and hope that if there is any fighting that I shall ride by  the side of Sidi.\"    The Arab smiled gravely. \"That assuredly you shall do. It is, as you  say, no one's fault, but the will of Allah, that has left you in my  charge, and I doubt not that good fortune will befall us thereby. Now,  what think you that is meant by the Franks landing at Marabout instead  of sailing on to attack the port?\"    \"It means, no doubt, that they are going to assault the city by land.  They probably do not know how weak are the fortifications, and fear that  the fleet might suffer much injury from their guns, and may therefore  prefer to attack from the land side.\"    \"But can they take the city that way?\"    \"I have no doubt that they can. Their guns could blow in the gates in a  very short time. Moreover, from the high ground near Pompey's Pillar  they could harass the defenders of the wall, or, if they chose, make a  breach in it. The wall is very old, and in many places in a bad state of  repair.\"    \"Could we go into the city and aid in the defence?\" the sheik asked.    \"There will be no entering from this side, sheik. The French army will  be between us and Alexandria, and, moreover, the guns from their  war-ships will be able to sweep the sands. We might pass round by the  south and enter the city from the other side; but your forty men would  add but little strength to the defence, and would be far more useful as  horsemen when the French begin their advance.\"    \"How long will it take them, think you, to capture the town? Help can  come down from Cairo in a week.\"    \"I think that the French will lose but little time, sheik. So long as  the town holds out, the fleet might be attacked by Nelson, should he  come back this way, while as soon as they have captured the town all  the light-draught vessels would find shelter in the harbour. You may be  sure that they would lose no time in mounting guns from the ships on the  forts, and render themselves perfectly safe from attack. They say that  Bonaparte is in command of the French. He is their ablest general, and  very active and enterprising. I should not be surprised if he captures  the place before sunset to-morrow.\"    The sheik made no reply. It seemed to him that Edgar's opinion that the  city which had withstood many sieges could be captured in a few hours  was too absurd to need argument.    \"There is nothing to be done now,\" he said; \"let us sleep. To-morrow,  before sunrise, we will make a detour round the south side of the city  and approach the eastern gate, and then decide whether to enter the town  or not.\"    In a few minutes there was silence in the camp, but long before the sun  rose everyone was astir. The women were to be left with the boys and old  men. The preparations were of the simplest character; each of the  thirty-eight men going hung a bag of dates at his saddle-bow, looked to  his firearms, and mounted. As the oasis was situated to the south-west  of the city, they did not strike the old bed of Lake Mareotis until  half-way along what had been its south shore.

If we had  come by train we would have missed all this beauty.\"    \"I see plainly that you do not appreciate the railroads, my dear,\"  returned her husband mischievously. \"This is the second time to-day that  you have slandered them. You sound like the early American traveler who  asserted that it was ridiculous to build railroads which did very  uncomfortably in two days what could be done delightfully by coach in  eight or ten.\"    \"Why, I should have thought people who had never heard of motor-cars  would have welcomed the quicker transportation the railroads offered,\"  was Mrs. Tolman's reply.    \"One would have thought so,\" answered Mr. Tolman. \"Still, when we recall  how primitive the first railroads were, the prejudice against them is  not to be wondered at.\"    \"How did they differ from those we have now, Dad?\" Doris asked.    \"In almost every way,\" answered her father, with a smile. \"You see at  the time Stephenson invented his steam locomotive nothing was known of  this novel method of travel. As I told you, persons were accustomed to  make journeys either by coach or canal. Then the steam engine was  invented and immediately the notion that this power might be applied to  transportation took possession of the minds of people in different parts  of England. As a result, first one and then another made a crude  locomotive and tried it out without scruple on the public highway, where  it not only frightened horses but terrified the passers-by. Many an  amusing story is told of the adventures of these amateur locomotives. A  machinist named Murdock, who was one of James Watt's assistants, built a  sort of grasshopper engine with very long piston rods and with legs at  the back to help push it along; with this odd contrivance he ventured  out into the road one night just at twilight. Unfortunately, however,  his restless toy started off before he was ready to have it, and  turning down an unfrequented lane encountered a timid clergyman who was  taking a peaceful stroll and frightened the old gentleman almost out of  his wits. The poor man had never seen a locomotive before and when the  steaming object with its glowing furnace and its host of moving arms and  legs came puffing toward him through the dusk he was overwhelmed with  terror and screamed loudly for help.\"    A laugh arose from the listeners.    \"And that is but one of the many droll experiences of the first  locomotive makers,\" continued Mr. Tolman. \"For example Trevithick,  another pioneer in the field, also built a small steam locomotive which  he took out on the road for a trial trip. It chanced that during the  experimental journey he and his fireman came to a tollgate and puffing  up to the keeper with the baby steam engine, they asked what the fee  would be for it to pass. Now the gate keeper, like the minister, had had  no acquaintance with locomotives, and on seeing the panting red object  looming like a specter out of the darkness and hearing a man's voice  intermingled with its gasps and snorts, he shouted with chattering  teeth:    \"There is nothing to pay, my dear Mr. Devil! Just d-r-i-v-e along as  f-a-s-t--as--ever--you--can.\"    His hearers applauded the story.    \"Who did finally invent the railroad?\" inquired Doris after the  merriment had subsided.    \"George Stephenson, an Englishman,\" replied her father. \"For some time  he had been experimenting with steam locomotives at the Newcastle coal  mines where some agency stronger than mules or horses was needed to  carry the products from one place to another. He had no idea of  transporting people when he began to work out the suggestion. All he  thought of was a coal train which would run on short lengths of track  from mine to mine. But the notion assumed unexpected proportions until  the Darlington road, the most ambitious of his projects, reached the  astonishing distance of thirty-seven miles. When the rails for it were  laid the engineer intended it should be used merely for coal  transportation, as its predecessors had been; but some of the miners who  lived along the route and were daily obliged to go back and forth to  work begged that some sort of a conveyance be made that could also run  along the track and enable them to ride to work instead of walking. So a  little log house not unlike a log cabin, with a table in the middle and  some chairs around it, was mounted on a cart that fitted the rails, and  a horse was harnessed to the unique vehicle.\"    \"And it was this log cabin on wheels that gave Stephenson his  inspiration for a railroad train!\" gasped Doris.    \"Yes,\" nodded her father. \"When the engineer saw the crude object the  first question that came to him was why could not a steam locomotive  propel cars filled with people as well as cars filled with coal.  Accordingly he set to work and had several coach bodies mounted on  trucks, installing a lever brake at the front of each one beside the  coachman's box. In front of the grotesque procession he placed a steam  locomotive and when he had fastened the coaches together he had the  first passenger train ever seen.\"    \"It must have been a funny looking thing!\" Steve exclaimed, smiling with  amusement at the picture the words suggested.    \"It certainly was,\" agreed his father. \"If you really wish to know how  funny, some time look up the prints of this great-great-grandfather of  our present-day Pullman and you will be well repaid for your trouble;  the contrast is laughable.\"    \"But was this absurd venture a success?\" queried Mrs. Tolman  incredulously.    \"Indeed it was!\" returned her husband. \"In fact, Stephenson, like Watt,  was one of the few world benefactors whose gift to humanity was  instantly hailed with appreciation. The railroad was, to be sure, a  wretched little affair when viewed from our modern standpoint, for there  were no gates at the crossings, no signals, springless cars, and every  imaginable discomfort. Fortunately, however, our ancestors had not grown  up amid the luxuries of this era, and being of rugged stock that was  well accustomed to hardships of every variety they pronounced the  invention a marvel, which in truth it was.    \"You've said it!\" chuckled Steve in the slang of the day.    \"In the meantime,\" went on Mr. Tolman, \"conditions all over England were  becoming more and more congested, and from every direction a clamor  arose for a remedy. You see the invention of steam spinning machinery  had greatly increased the output of the Manchester cotton mills until  there was no such thing as getting such a vast bulk of merchandise to  those who were eager to have it. Bales of goods waiting to be  transported to Liverpool not only overflowed the warehouses but were  even stacked in the open streets where they were at the mercy of robbers  and storms. The canals had all the business they could handle, and as is  always the result in such cases their owners became arrogant under their  prosperity and raised their prices, making not the slightest attempt to  help the public out of its dilemma. Undoubtedly something had to be done  and in desperation a committee from Parliament sent for Stephenson that  they might discuss with him the feasibility of building a railroad from  Manchester to Liverpool. The committee had no great faith in the  enterprise. Most of its members did not believe that a railroad of any  sort was practical or that it could ever attain speed enough to be of  service. However, it was a possibility, and as they did not know which  way to turn to quiet the exasperated populace they felt they might as  well investigate this remedy. It could do no harm.\"    Mr. Tolman paused as he stooped to change the gear of the car.    \"So Stephenson came before the board, and one question after another was  hurled at him. When, however, he was asked, half in ridicule, whether or  not his locomotive could make thirty miles an hour and he answered in  the affirmative, a shout of derision arose from the Parliament members.  Nobody believed such a miracle possible. Nevertheless, in spite of their  sceptical attitude, it was finally decided to build the  Liverpool-Manchester road and about a year before its opening a date was  set for a contest of locomotives to compete for the five-hundred-pound  prize offered by the directors of the road.\"    \"I suppose ever so many engines entered the lists,\" ventured Steve with  interest.    \"There were four,\" returned his father.    \"And Stephenson drove one of them?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Oh, I hope it got the prize!\" put in Doris eagerly.    Her father smiled at her earnestness.    \"It did,\" was his reply. \"Stephenson's engine was called the 'Rocket'  and was a great improvement over the locomotive he had used at the  mines, for this one had not only a steam blast but a multi-tubular  boiler, a tremendous advance in engine building.\"    \"I suppose that the winner of the prize not only got the money the road  offered but his engine was the one chosen as a pattern for those to be  used on the new railroad,\" ventured Stephen.    \"Precisely. So you see a great deal depended on the showing each  locomotive made. Unluckily in the excitement a tinder box had been  forgotten, and when it came time to start, the spark to light the fires  had to be obtained from a reading glass borrowed from one of the  spectators. This, of course, caused some delay. But once the fires were  blazing and steam up, the engines puffed away to the delight of those  looking on.\"    \"I am glad Stephenson was the winner,\" put in Doris.    \"Yes,\" agreed her father. \"He had worked hard and deserved success. It  would not have seemed fair for some one else to have stolen the fruit of  his toil and brain. Yet notwithstanding this, his path to fame was not  entirely smooth. Few persons "]]]
