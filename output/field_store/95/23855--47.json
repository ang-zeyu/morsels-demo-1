CHAPTER VII    ESTELLE'S LEAP      \"Oh!\" murmured Alice, shrinking down in her chair. \"Oh--my!\"    She gave a hasty glance over her shoulder, to behold Paul Ardite  standing back of her chair, an angry look on his face. Then Alice looked  at the sprawling form of the extra player. He was getting up with a  dazed expression on his countenance.    \"What--what does this mean?\" he gasped, striving to make his tones  indignant. But it is hard for dignity to assert itself when one is on  one's hands and knees in the grass, conscious that there is a big grass  stain on one's white cuff, and with one's clothing generally  disarranged. \"What does this mean? I demand an explanation,\" came from  Mr. Maurice Whitlow.    \"You know well enough what it means!\" snapped Paul. \"If you don't, why,  come back here and try it over again and I'll give you another  demonstration!\"    \"Oh, don't, Paul--please!\" pleaded Alice in a low voice.    \"There's no danger. He won't come,\" was the confident reply.    By this time Whitlow had picked himself up and was brushing his  garments. He settled his collar, straightened his lavender tie and wet  his lips as though about to speak.    \"You--you--I----\" he began. \"I don't see what right you had to----\"    \"That'll do now!\" interrupted Paul, sternly. \"It's of no use to go into  explanations. You know as well as I do what you were doing and why I  pitched you over the railing. I'll do it again if you want me to, but  twice as hard. And if I catch you here again, annoying any of the ladies  of this company, I'll report you to the director. Now skip--and stay  skipped!\" concluded Paul significantly. \"Perhaps you can't read that  notice?\" and he pointed to one recently posted on the main gateway  leading to the big farmhouse. It was to the effect that none of the  extra players were allowed admission to the grounds without a permit  from the director.    \"Huh! I'm as good an actor as you, any day!\" sneered Whitlow, as he  limped down the walk.    \"Maybe. But you can't get over with it--here!\" said Paul significantly.    The notice had been posted because so many of the cowboys and girls had  fairly overrun the precincts of Mr. Apgar's home. He and his family had  no privacy at all, and while they did not mind the regular members of  Mr. Pertell's company, with whom they were acquainted, they did not want  the hundreds of extra men, soldiers, cowboys and horsewomen running all  over the place.    So the rule had been adopted, and it was observed good-naturedly by  those to whom it applied. Whitlow must have considered himself above it.    \"Did he annoy you much, Alice?\" asked Paul.    \"Not so very. He was just what you might call--fresh. He asked for Miss  Brown, and when she wasn't here to snub him he turned the task over to  me. Ugh!\" and Alice began to scrub vigorously with her handkerchief the  fingers which Whitlow had grasped. \"I'm sorry you had that trouble with  him, Paul,\" she went on. \"But really----\"    \"It was no trouble--it was a pleasure!\" laughed Paul. \"I'd like to do it  over again if it were not for annoying you. I happened to come up behind  and heard what he was saying. So I just pitched into him. I don't  believe he'll come back. He'll be too much afraid of losing the work.  Mr. Pertell has had a great many applications from players out of work  who want to be taken on as extras, and he can have his pick. So those  that don't obey the regulations will get short notice. You won't be  troubled with him again.\"    And Alice was not, nor was Miss Brown. That is, as regards the extra  player's trespassing on the grounds about the farmhouse. But he was of  the kind that is persistent, and on several occasions, when the duties  of the girls brought them near to where Whitlow was acting, he smiled  and smirked at them.    Alice wished to tell Paul about it and have him administer another and  more severe chastisement to Whitlow, but Ruth and Estelle persuaded the  impulsive one to forego doing so.    \"I can look after myself, thank you, Alice dear,\" Estelle said. \"Now  that I don't have to board in the bungalow with him it is easier.\"    \"Don't make a scene,\" advised Ruth.    \"Oh, but I just can't bear to have him look at me,\" Alice said.    Several of the scenes in the principal drama had been made, but most of  the largest ones, those of the battles, of Alice's spy work, and of  Ruth's nursing, were yet to come.    The making of a big moving picture is the work not of days, but of  weeks, and often of months. If every scene took place in a studio,  where artificial lights could be used, the filming could go on every day  the actors were on hand, or whenever the director felt like working them  and the camera men. Often in a studio, even, the director will be  notional--\"temperamental,\" he might call it--and let a day go by, and  again the glare of the powerful lights may so affect the eyes of the  players that they have to rest, and so time is lost in that way.    But the time lost in a studio is as nothing compared to the time lost in  filming the big outdoor scenes. There the sun is a big factor, for a  brilliant light is needed to take pictures of galloping horses, swiftly  moving automobiles and locomotives, and every cloudy day means a loss of  time. For this reason many of the big film companies maintain studios in  California, where there are many days of sunshine. They can take  \"outdoor stuff\" almost any time after the sun is up.    But at Oak Farm there were times when everything would be in readiness  for a big scene, the camera men waiting, the players ready to dash into  their parts, and then clouds would form, or it would rain, and there  would be a postponement. But it was part of the game, and as the  salaries of the players went on whether they worked or not, they did not  complain.    One morning Alice, on going into Estelle's room, found her busy  \"padding\" herself before she put on her outer garments.    \"What in the world are you doing?\" Alice asked.    \"Getting ready for my big jump,\" was the answer.    \"Your big jump?\"    \"Yes, you know there is a scene where I carry a message from  headquarters to one of the Union generals at the front. Your father  plays the latter part.\"    \"Oh, yes, now I remember. And Daddy is sure no one can do quite as well  as he can in the tent scene, where he salutes you and takes the message  you have brought through with such peril.\"    \"Yes, that's nice. Well, I'm to ride along and be pursued by some  Confederate guerrillas. It's a race, and I decide to take a short cut,  not knowing the Confederates have burned the bridge. I have to leap my  horse down an embankment and ford the stream. I'm getting ready for the  jump now--that's why I'm padding myself. For Petro--that's my  horse--might slip or stumble in jumping down that embankment, and I want  to be ready to roll out of the way. It's much more comfortable to roll  in a padded suit--like a football player's--than in your ordinary  clothes. Your friend, Russ Dalwood, told me to do this, and I think it  is a good idea.\"    \"It's sure to be if Russ told you, isn't it, Ruth?\" asked Alice, with a  mischievous look at her sister, who had just come in.    \"How should I know?\" was the cool response. \"I suppose Mr. Dalwood knows  what he is doing, though.\"    \"Oh, how very formal we are all of a sudden,\" mocked Alice. \"You two  haven't quarreled, have you?\"    \"Silly,\" returned Ruth, blushing.    \"Are you really going to jump your horse down a cliff?\" asked Alice.    \"I really am,\" was the smiling answer. \"There is to be no fake about  this. But really there is little danger. I am so used to horses.\"    \"Yes, and I marvel at you,\" put in Ruth. \"Where did you learn it all?\"    \"I don't know. It seems to come natural to me.\"    \"You must have lived on a ranch a long time,\" ventured Ruth.    \"Did I? Well, perhaps I did. Say, lace this up the back for me, that's a  dear,\" and she turned around so that Alice or Ruth could fasten a  corset-like pad that covered a large part of her body. It would not  show under her dress, but would be a protection in case of a fall.    Alice and Ruth were so greatly interested in the coming perilous leap of  Estelle's that they did not pursue their inquiries about her life on a  ranch, though Alice casually remarked that it was strange she did not  speak more about it.    The two DeVere girls had no part in this one scene, and they went to  watch it, safely out of range of the cameras. For there were to be two  snapping this jump, to avoid the necessity of a retake in case one film  failed.    \"All ready now!\" called Mr. Pertell, when there had been several  rehearsals up to the actual point of making the jump. Estelle had raced  out of the woods bearing the message. The Confederate guerrillas had  pursued her, and she had found the bridge burned--one built for the  purpose and set fire to.    \"All ready for the jump?\" asked the director.    \"All ready,\" Estelle answered, looking to saddle girths and stirrups.    \"Then come on!\" yelled the director through his megaphone.    Estelle urged her horse forward. With shouts and yells, which, of  course, had no part in the picture, yet which served to aid them in  their acting, the players who were portraying the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20354"],[0,"Jack of Both Sides: The Story of a School War (#8)"],[1," be small, but he was brimful of bright ideas.    \"Fight,\" he replied. \"We're much fewer, but it would be mostly a matter  of siege and stratagem, and if we planned it out, I bet we could give  them a wipe-down.\"    \"I mayn't fight,\" said Frere sadly. \"They won't allow me to.\"    \"And I'm awfully afraid I can't,\" added Hughes.    \"What's more, you sha'n't, Ethel!\" said Simmons, who was amusingly  careful of his friend's health. \"There'll be lots of quiet work for you  and Frere--scouting and so forth.\"    \"I'm nuts on fighting,\" put in Armitage.    \"As for me, I'm spoiling for the fray,\" laughed Mason, exhibiting the  muscle of his arm with great pride.    \"Oh, well, it will teach them to respect us anyway. And that will be  something gained,\" said Simmons. \"Mason, will you captain us?\"    \"Not much! No, I'll do my duty as a lieutenant, but I am no commander.  Nor are you. You're too little.\"    \"Napoleon--Nelson!\" muttered Simmons. He would have liked the offer of  the post, and his size was a sore point with him.    \"Jack Brady must be captain,\" said Bacon firmly, and all agreed with  him.    \"However could we have forgotten him?\" exclaimed Hughes.    \"He's the right man, if he'll consent,\" remarked Mason. \"But I wish I  felt sure about that.\"    [Illustration]    \"Well, I see at the present moment he's hobnobbing with the enemy,\" said  Hughes doubtfully.    \"Oh, but he's really one of us, he has been all along,\" cried Simmons.  \"Here, Brady, you're wanted.\"    \"At your service,\" said Jack merrily, and, breaking off his conversation  with Trevelyan and Vickers, he joined the group of day-boys.    \"Brady, have you heard that they've dragged us into this row? That our  half's stopped along with the boarders'? Though none of us ever saw or  tasted so much as a drum-stick!\"    \"None of you? Ever?\" put in Jack. \"That's a big order, Piggy-wig.\"    \"You know what I mean,\" rejoined Bacon. \"They might have had a swan or a  peacock for all we knew about it.\"    \"But, my dear fellow, it's West you must blame. No one mentioned you.\"    \"No, but not one of them had the honesty to stand out and clear us--to  assure him we'd nothing to do with it,\" said Mason. \"Instead of that  they are careful to turn it into a mystery, on purpose that we may all  be suspected.\"    \"Well, well, it's only just a single half that's lost. It'll soon be  over and forgotten.\"    \"Will it?\" cried Simmons indignantly. \"I fancy it will be remembered  longer than you think by some. We mean to pay them in full for their  mean spite. We're going to unite and fight.\"    \"Oh, challenge them to a cricket match instead! I'll play for you.  Think how much more sportive that will be! Not to say, sensible.\"    \"Come, Brady, we're not babies. We mean to make them sorry by force.\"    \"Take care you're not made sorry by force, Lucy!\"    \"Oh, never fear! The masters won't know anything at all about it if we  can help it. We shall pick our opportunity. But look here, Brady, you've  got to captain us!\"    \"Bothered if I do!\" said Jack.    \"Very well, don't! Go over to the boarders instead, as you want to, and  repeat everything we've told you.\" Bacon spoke angrily.    \"Piggy-wig, don't be a fool! If you want me to quarrel either with your  set or with the other chaps, I say I won't, and that's flat! You must  take me as you find me, and if you're all bent on fighting and making  geese of yourselves, I shall just stay as I am--once for all--Jack of  Both Sides.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE MARCH HARE'S REVENGE      Cling, clang--creak! Cling, clang--creak! So the discordant bell sounded  forth in the playground, the interval between the strokes being filled  by a harsh, rusty squeak that set one's teeth on edge. The message it  bore to the boys was, \"Come in--quick! Come in--quick!\" For the time was  ten minutes to nine, and the day that following the incident which was  already known as the Chicken Row.    The monitors this week were Brady, Bacon, and Armitage, and they had  already gone in to their duties. The old bell always went on ringing for  two minutes, and the boys were in the habit of waiting until it was on  the point of ceasing, when they obeyed it with a rush.    But on this particular morning the day-scholars seemed, for some reason  best known to themselves, one and all consumed with zeal for their  studies. At the first preparatory creak they made a simultaneous dash  for the entrance, which caused much mirth amongst the boarders.    Cadbury waved his arm in their direction, and turned up his eyes with an  air of mock tragedy, while he spouted with rolling \"r's\":        \"How fair a sight it is to see      Youth lay aside its giddy glee,      Athirst for learning's boundless sea!      How different from you and me!\"    \"My dear boys,\" said Vickers, with pretended solemnity, \"I require  obedience in you, but I desire something more--something which you can  give, but I cannot command. That something is cheerful obedience--ready  obedience--obedience that hurries gladly at the call of duty. And now  that you see a pattern of such obedience, you might do worse than copy  it.\"    His imitation of Mr. West's emphatic voice and rather studied manner was  so true to life that it was greeted with a roar of laughter, and for  once Vickers had the gratification of seeing his wit appreciated. The  very phrase, \"you might do worse\", was a favourite with the head-master,  and one which the boys had long ago selected for mimicry.    But now there came the faint, irregular stroke that foretold the  stopping of the bell, and the boys moved quickly towards the entrance,  and began to jostle one another in their haste. On reaching the door,  however, much fumbling and kicking began.    \"Hi, you in front there! Look sharp and go in! We're waiting!\" cried  Hallett in a voice of angry authority, and pushing commenced in the  rear.    \"It's no good pushing; it's stuck!\" was holloaed back, and the kicking  and banging increased in vigour.    \"What nonsense! Let me come! It must be opened! Won't Pepper wire into  us in a minute!\"    Green elbowed his way to the front, and turned the handle violently.  Only once, and then he faced round with the exclamation, \"You fools!  It's locked!\"    At which news much breath and a little time were wasted in furious  threats towards those by whom they had been tricked.    \"Won't they pay for this!\"    \"West shall hear if they don't let us in sharp.\"    \"I'll knock their heads together when I do get in!\"    \"The impudent beggars! We'll give them such a lesson!\"    But within all was glee and triumph. Simmons and Bacon fairly danced  with malicious satisfaction, whilst Armitage and Mason chuckled grimly.    \"What'll they do? Go round to the front?\"    \"They'll catch it if they do.\"    \"We shall too if the joke once reaches West,\" said Jack. \"Don't you  think you might wind up the trick now, and let them in?\"    \"All in good time,\" said Mason coolly. The banging at the entrance grew  terrific, and though separated from the first class-room by a long  passage, he had to raise his voice to be heard above it. \"Let's be quite  sure that we're ready for them. You--Bacon and Armitage--have you done  your job?\"    \"Yes, properly.\"    \"We ought to, for we've been at it nearly half an hour.\"    \"And you others--Brady, Ethel, Lucy, et cetera--you've all got your  books ready?\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" laughed Simmons.    \"What was your job, Armie?\" asked Jack. He had been engrossed in inking  new slates.    Armitage smothered a laugh.    \"Muddling, Jack, my boy, muddling! And a truly artistic muddle have we  made. It's been a game of 'General Post' with the books. The  dictionaries have taken the atlases' place, the Greek grammars have  deposed the Latins, and--\"    \"Hist!\" interrupted Jack. \"I smell Pepper! We must whistle to Ethel.\"  And without waiting for permission he did so.    \"Ethel\" was posted down the long passage by the school entrance, with  instructions to turn the key back when he heard the signal. The sound of  unlocking was drowned in the hubbub without, and, turning, he fled  noiselessly up the passage and into the school-room, at the identical  moment in which two others made their appearance there--namely Mr.  Peace, through the opposite door, and Norman Hallett outside the window!    \"Now, then, where is everybody?\" cried the fussy little master, seeing  less than a dozen boys assembled for work. Then his eye fell on  Hallett's pale, angry face peering through the glass. \"Why, Hallett  outside? What's the meaning of this? What's the meaning of this?\"    \"Do you think perhaps they didn't hear the bell, sir?\" suggested  Simmons. \"They've been making rather a noise outside.\"    Mr. Peace was not deceived by the boy's demureness.    \"You want your ears boxed, you rogue!\" he began; but at that moment in  surged a torrent of rather frightened, very wrathful boys, who had been  unprofitably spending the last half-minute in striving with penknives to  force the lock of the already unfastened door.    However, the rudiments of school honour forbade their furnishing the  master with an account of the occurrence, and they had to content  themselves with breathing dark threats to those day-boys who crossed  their path in the frantic rush to the book-room.    At sight of that rush a few of the milder spirits, such as Hughes and  Frere, held their breath in dreadful foreboding, while the unconscious  Mr. Peace roared:    \"Now, then, how long do you mean to stay in there? The clock's on the  strike. I mark every boy who isn't in his place when it stops! Do you  hear me? Do you hear me, I say?\"    \"No,\" responded Cadbury, without thinking. Then, poking his head out,  \"What are we to do, sir, please? We can't find our books. Everything is  changed. It's worse than a spring cleaning. Won't you look and see,  sir?\"    [Illustration]    Before the invitation could be answered, there was an impatient knock of  authority in the school-room--a rap of"]]]
