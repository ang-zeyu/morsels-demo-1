Utterly unconscious of this world and all that is therein, he dwelt  continually on God, remaining submerged in supplications and prayers. Most  of the time, tears poured from his eyes. The Blessed Beauty singled him  out for special favor, and whenever He turned His attention toward Sadiq,  His loving-kindness was clear to see.    On a certain day they brought word that Sadiq was at the point of death. I  went to his bedside and found him breathing his last. He was suffering  from ileus, an abdominal pain and swelling. I hurried to Baha'u'llah and  described his condition. \"Go,\" He said. \"Place your hand on the distended  area and speak the words: 'O Thou the Healer!'\"(26)    I went back. I saw that the affected part had swollen up to the size of an  apple; it was hard as stone, in constant motion, twisting, and coiling  about itself like a snake. I placed my hand upon it; I turned toward God  and, humbly beseeching Him, I repeated the words, \"O Thou the Healer!\"  Instantly the sick man rose up. The ileus vanished; the swelling was  carried off.    This personified spirit lived contentedly in 'Iraq until the day when  Baha'u'llah's convoy wended its way out of Ba_gh_dad. As bidden, Sadiq  remained behind in that city. But his longing beat so passionately within  him that after the arrival of Baha'u'llah at Mosul, he could endure the  separation no more. Shoeless, hatless, he ran out alongside the courier  going to Mosul; ran and ran until, on that barren plain, with mercy all  about him, he fell to his rest.    May God give him to drink from \"a wine cup tempered at the camphor  fountain,\"(27) and send down crystal waters on his grave; may God perfume  his dust in that desert place with musk, and cause to descend there range  on range of light.            SHAH-MUHAMMAD-AMIN      _Sh_ah-Muhammad, who had the title of Amin, the Trusted One, was among the  earliest of believers, and most deeply enamored. He had listened to the  Divine summons in the flower of his youth, and set his face toward the  Kingdom. He had ripped from his gaze the veils of idle suppositions and  had won his heart's desire; neither the fancies current among the people  nor the reproaches of which he was the target turned him back. Unshaken,  he stood and faced a sea of troubles; staunch with the strength of the  Advent day, he confronted those who tried to thwart him and block his  path. The more they sought to instill doubts in his mind, the stronger he  became; the more they tormented him, the more progress he made. He was a  captive of the face of God, enslaved by the beauty of the All-Glorious; a  flame of God's love, a jetting fountain of the knowledge of Him.    Love smoldered in his heart, so that he had no peace; and when he could  bear the absence of the Beloved One no more, he left his native home, the  province of Yazd. He found the desert sands like silk under his feet;  light as the wind's breath, he passed over the mountains and across the  endless plains, until he stood at the door of his Love. He had freed  himself from the snare of separation, and in 'Iraq, he entered the  presence of Baha'u'llah.    Once he made his way into the home of the Darling of mankind, he was  emptied of every thought, released from every concern, and became the  recipient of boundless favor and grace. He passed some days in 'Iraq and  was directed to return to Persia. There he remained for a time,  frequenting the believers; and his pure breathings stirred each one of  them anew, so that each one yearned over the Faith, and became more  restless, more impatient than before.    Later he arrived at the Most Great Prison with Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, the  second Amin. On this journey he met with severe hardships, for it was  extremely difficult to find a way into the prison. Finally he was received  by Baha'u'llah in the public baths. Mirza Abu'l-Hasan was so overwhelmed  at the majestic presence of his Lord that he shook, stumbled, and fell to  the floor; his head was injured and the blood flowed out.    Amin, that is _Sh_ah-Muhammad, was honored with the title of the Trusted  One, and bounties were showered upon him. Full of eagerness and love,  taking with him Tablets from Baha'u'llah, he hastened back to Persia,  where, at all times worthy of trust, he labored for the Cause. His  services were outstanding, and he was a consolation to the believers'  hearts. There was none to compare with him for energy, enthusiasm and  zeal, and no man's services could equal his. He was a haven amidst the  people, known everywhere for devotion to the Holy Threshold, widely  acclaimed by the friends.    He never rested for a moment. Not one night did he spend on a bed of ease,  never did he lay down his head on comfort's pillow. He was continuously in  flight, soaring as the birds do, running like a deer, guesting in the  desert of oneness, alone and swift. He brought joy to all the believers;  to all, his coming was good news; to every seeker, he was a sign and  token. He was enamored of God, a vagrant in the desert of God's love. Like  the wind, he traveled over the face of the plains, and he was restive on  the heights of the hills. He was in a different country every day, and in  yet another land by nightfall. Never did he rest, never was he still. He  was forever rising up to serve.    But then they took him prisoner in A_dh_irbayjan, in the town of  Miyandu'ab. He fell a prey to some ruthless Kurds, a hostile band who  asked no questions of the innocent, defenseless man. Believing that this  stranger, like other foreigners, wished ill to the Kurdish people, and  taking him for worthless, they killed him.    When news of his martyrdom reached the Prison, all the captives grieved,  and they shed tears for him, resigned to God and undefended as he was in  his last hour. Even on the countenance of Baha'u'llah, there were visible  tokens of grief. A Tablet, infinitely tender, was revealed by the Supreme  Pen, commemorating the man who died on that calamitous plain, and many  other Tablets were sent down concerning him.    Today, under the shadowing mercy of God, he dwells in the bright Heavens.  He communes with the birds of holiness, and in the assemblage of splendors  he is immersed in light. The memory and praise of him shall remain, till  the end of time, in the pages of books and on the tongues and lips of men.    Unto him be salutations and praise; upon him be the glory of the  All-Glorious; upon him be the most great mercy of God.            MASHHADI FATTAH      Ma_sh_hadi Fattah was personified spirit. He was devotion itself. Brother  to Haji 'Ali-'Askar--of the same pure lineage--through the latter he came  into the Faith. Like the twins, Castor and Pollux, the two kept together  in one spot, and both were illumined with the light of belief.    In all things, the two were united as a pair; they shared the same  certitude and faith, the same conscience, and made their way out of  A_dh_irbayjan to Adrianople, emigrating at the same time. In every  circumstance of their life, they lived as one individual; their  disposition, their aims, their religion, character, behavior, faith,  certitude, knowledge--all were one. Even in the Most Great Prison, they  were constantly together.    Ma_sh_hadi Fattah possessed some merchandise; this was all he owned in the  world. He had entrusted it to persons in Adrianople, and later on those  unrighteous people did away with the goods. Thus, in the pathway of God,  he lost whatever he possessed. He passed his days, perfectly content, in  the Most Great Prison. He was utter selflessness; from him, no one ever  heard a syllable to indicate that he existed. He was always in a certain  corner of the prison, silently meditating, occupied with the remembrance  of God; at all times spiritually alert and mindful, in a state of  supplication.    Then came the Supreme Affliction. He could not tolerate the anguish of  parting with Baha'u'llah, and after Baha'u'llah's passing, he died of  grief. Blessed is he; again, blessed is he. Glad tidings to him; again,  glad tidings to him. Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious.            NABIL OF QA'IN      This distinguished man, Mulla Muhammad-'Ali,(28) was one of those whose  hearts were drawn to Baha'u'llah before the Declaration of the Bab; it was  then that he drank the red wine of knowledge from the hands of the  Cupbearer of grace. It happened that a prince, who was the son of Mir  Asadu'llah _Kh_an, prince of Qa'in, was commanded to remain as a political  hostage in Tihran. He was young, far away from his loving father, and  Mulla Muhammad-'Ali was his tutor and guardian. Since the youth was a  stranger in Tihran, the Blessed Beauty showed him special kindness. Many a  night the young prince was Baha'u'llah's guest at the mansion, and Mulla  Muhammad-'Ali would accompany him. This was prior to the Declaration of  the Bab.    It was then that this chief of all trusted friends was captivated by  Baha'u'llah, and wherever he went, spread loving praise of Him. After the  way of Islam, he also related the great miracles which he had, with his  own eyes, seen Baha'u'llah perform, and the marvels he had heard. He was  in ecstasy, burning up with love. In that condition, he returned to Qa'in  with the prince.    Later on that eminent scholar, Aqa Muhammad of Qa'in (whose title was  Nabil-i-Akbar) was made a mujtahid, a doctor of religious law, by the late  _Sh_ay_kh_ Murtada; he left, then, for Ba_gh_dad, became an ardent  follower of Baha'u'llah, and hastened back to Persia. The leading divines  and mujtahids were well aware of and acknowledged his vast scholarly  accomplishments, the breadth of his learning, and his high rank. When he  reached Qa'in, he began openly to spread the new Faith. The moment Mulla  Muhammad-'Ali heard the name of the Blessed Beauty, he immediately  accepted the Bab. \"I had the honor,\" he said, \"of meeting the Blessed  Beauty in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#8)"],[1,"did  bring the truth, ye refused to turn your faces towards Him, and persisted  in disporting yourselves with your pastimes and fancies. Ye welcomed Him  not, neither did ye seek His Presence, that ye might hear the verses of  God from His own mouth, and partake of the manifold wisdom of the  Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise. Ye have, by reason of your  failure, hindered the breath of God from being wafted over you, and have  withheld from your souls the sweetness of its fragrance. Ye continue  roving with delight in the valley of your corrupt desires. Ye and all ye  possess shall pass away. Ye shall, most certainly, return to God, and  shall be called to account for your doings in the presence of Him Who  shall gather together the entire creation....\"    The Bab, moreover, in the Qayyum-i-Asma, His celebrated commentary on the  Surih of Joseph, revealed in the first year of His Mission, and  characterized by Baha'u'llah as \"the first, the greatest, and mightiest of  all books\" in the Babi Dispensation, has issued this stirring call to the  kings and princes of the earth:    \"O concourse of kings and of the sons of kings! Lay aside, one and all,  your dominion which belongeth unto God.... Vain indeed is your dominion,  for God hath set aside earthly possessions for such as have denied Him....  O concourse of kings! Deliver with truth and in all haste the verses sent  down by Us to the peoples of Turkey and of India, and beyond them, with  power and with truth, to lands in both the East and the West.... By God!  If ye do well, to your own behoof will ye do well; and if ye deny God and  His signs, We, in very truth, having God, can well dispense with all  creatures and all earthly dominion.\"    And again: \"Fear ye God, O concourse of kings, lest ye remain afar from  Him Who is His Remembrance [the Bab], after the Truth hath come unto you  with a Book and signs from God, as spoken through the wondrous tongue of  Him Who is His Remembrance. Seek ye grace from God, for God hath ordained  for you, after ye have believed in Him, a Garden the vastness of which is  as the vastness of the whole of Paradise.\"    So much for the epoch-making counsels and warnings collectively addressed  by the Bab and Baha'u'llah to the sovereigns of the earth, and more  particularly directed to the kings of Christendom. I would be failing to  do justice to my theme were I to ignore, or even to dismiss briefly, those  audacious, fate-laden apostrophes to individual monarchs who, whether as  kings or emperors, have either viewed with cold indifference the  tribulations, or rejected with contempt the warnings, of the twin Founders  of our Faith. I can neither quote as fully as I should from the two  thousand and more verses that have streamed from the pen of Baha'u'llah  and, to a lesser extent, from that of the Bab, addressed to individual  monarchs in Europe and Asia, nor is it my purpose to expatiate upon the  circumstances that have provoked, or the consequences that have flowed  from, those astounding utterances. The historian of the future, viewing  more widely and in fuller perspective the momentous happenings of the  Apostolic and Formative Ages of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, will no doubt be  able to evaluate accurately and to describe in a circumstantial manner the  causes, the implications and the effects of these Divine Messages which,  in their scope and effectiveness, have certainly no parallel in the  religious annals of mankind.    To the French Emperor, Napoleon III, Baha'u'llah addressed these words: \"O  King of Paris! Tell the priest to ring the bells no longer. By God, the  True One! The Most Mighty Bell hath appeared in the form of Him Who is the  Most Great Name, and the fingers of the will of thy Lord, the Most  Exalted, the Most High, toll it out in the heaven of Immortality, in His  Name, the All-Glorious. Thus have the mighty verses of thy Lord been again  sent down unto thee, that thou mayest arise to remember God, the Creator  of earth and heaven, in these days when all the tribes of the earth have  mourned, and the foundations of the cities have trembled, and the dust of  irreligion hath enwrapped all men, except such as thy Lord, the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise, was pleased to spare.... Give ear, O King, unto  the Voice that calleth from the Fire which burneth in this Verdant Tree,  upon this Sinai which hath been raised above the hallowed and snow-white  Spot, beyond the Everlasting City: 'Verily, there is none other God but  Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful!' We, in truth, have sent Him  Whom We aided with the Holy Spirit [Jesus], that He may announce unto you  this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of your  Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and Whose signs have been  revealed in the West, that ye may set your faces towards Him  [Baha'u'llah], on this Day which God hath exalted above all other days,  and whereon the All-Merciful hath shed the splendor of His effulgent glory  upon all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Arise thou to serve  God and help His Cause. He, verily, will assist thee with the hosts of the  seen and unseen, and will set thee king over all that whereon the sun  riseth. Thy Lord, in truth, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.... Attire  thy temple with the ornament of My Name, and thy tongue with remembrance  of Me, and thine heart with love for Me, the Almighty, the Most High. We  have desired for thee naught except that which is better for thee than  what thou dost possess and all the treasures of the earth. Thy Lord,  verily, is knowing, informed of all....    \"O King! We heard the words thou didst utter in answer to the Czar of  Russia, concerning the decision made regarding the war [Crimean War]. Thy  Lord, verily, knoweth, is informed of all. Thou didst say: 'I lay asleep  upon my couch, when the cry of the oppressed, who were drowned in the  Black Sea, wakened me.' This is what we heard thee say, and, verily, thy  Lord is witness unto what I say. We testify that that which wakened thee  was not their cry, but the promptings of thine own passions, for We tested  thee, and found thee wanting. Comprehend the meaning of My words, and be  thou of the discerning.... Hadst thou been sincere in thy words, thou  wouldst have not cast behind thy back the Book of God, when it was sent  unto thee by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. We have proved thee  through it, and found thee other than that which thou didst profess.  Arise, and make amends for that which escaped thee. Erelong the world and  all that thou possessest will perish, and the kingdom will remain unto  God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers of old. It behooveth thee not to  conduct thine affairs according to the dictates of thy desires. Fear the  sighs of this Wronged One, and shield Him from the darts of such as act  unjustly. For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into  confusion, and thine empire shall pass from thine hands, as a punishment  for that which thou hast wrought. Then wilt thou know how thou hast  plainly erred. Commotions shall seize all the people in that land, unless  thou arisest to help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the Spirit of  God [Jesus] in this, the straight Path. Hath thy pomp made thee proud? By  My Life! It shall not endure; nay, it shall soon pass away, unless thou  holdest fast by this firm Cord. We see abasement hastening after thee,  while thou art of the heedless.... Abandon thy palaces to the people of  the graves, and thine empire to whosoever desireth it, and turn, then,  unto the Kingdom. This, verily, is what God hath chosen for thee, wert  thou of them that turn unto Him.... Shouldst thou desire to bear the  weight of thy dominion, bear it then to aid the Cause of thy Lord.  Glorified be this station which whoever attaineth thereunto hath attained  unto all good that proceedeth from Him Who is the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.... Exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess, knowing  they shall perish? Rejoicest thou in that thou rulest a span of earth,  when the whole world, in the estimation of the people of Baha, is worth as  much as the black in the eye of a dead ant? Abandon it unto such as have  set their affections upon it, and turn thou unto Him Who is the Desire of  the world. Whither are gone the proud and their palaces? Gaze thou into  their tombs, that thou mayest profit by this example, inasmuch as We made  it a lesson unto every beholder. Were the breezes of Revelation to seize  thee, thou wouldst flee the world, and turn unto the Kingdom, and wouldst  expend all thou possessest, that thou mayest draw nigh unto this sublime  Vision.\"            REVEALED TO THE POPE      To Pope Pius IX, Baha'u'llah revealed the following: \"O Pope! Rend the  veils asunder. He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with  clouds, and the decree hath been fulfilled by God, the Almighty, the  Unrestrained.... He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven even as He  came down from it the first time. Beware that thou dispute not with Him  even as the Pharisees disputed with Him [Jesus] without a clear token or  proof. On His right hand flow the living waters of grace, and on His left  the choice Wine of justice, whilst before Him march the angels of  Paradise, bearing the banners of His signs. Beware lest any name debar  thee from God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Leave thou the world  behind thee, and turn towards thy Lord, through Whom the whole earth hath  been illumined.... Dwellest thou in palaces whilst He Who is the King of  Revelation liveth in the most desolate of abodes? Leave them unto such as  desire them, and set thy face with joy and delight towards the Kingdom....  Arise in the name of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, amidst the peoples of the  earth, and seize thou the Cup of Life with the hands of confidence, and  first drink thou therefrom, and proffer it then to such as turn towards it"]]]
