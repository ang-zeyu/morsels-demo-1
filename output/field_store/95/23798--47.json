Yes he knows that--This very evening I was to have brought him a  gentleman from the city who does not know him and will I believe advance  some money.    SIR PETER. What[!] one Charles has never had money from before?    MOSES. Yes[--]Mr. Premium, of Crutched Friars.    SIR PETER. Egad, Sir Oliver a Thought strikes me!--Charles you say  does'nt know Mr. Premium?    MOSES. Not at all.    SIR PETER. Now then Sir Oliver you may have a better opportunity of  satisfying yourself than by an old romancing tale of a poor Relation--go  with my friend Moses and represent Mr. Premium and then I'll answer  for't you'll see your Nephew in all his glory.    SIR OLIVER. Egad I like this Idea better than the other, and I may visit  Joseph afterwards as old Stanley.    SIR PETER. True so you may.    ROWLEY. Well this is taking Charles rather at a disadvantage, to be  sure--however Moses--you understand Sir Peter and will be faithful----    MOSES. You may depend upon me--and this is near the Time I was to have  gone.    SIR OLIVER. I'll accompany you as soon as you please, Moses----but  hold--I have forgot one thing--how the plague shall I be able to pass  for a Jew?    MOSES. There's no need--the Principal is Christian.    SIR OLIVER. Is He--I'm very sorry to hear it--but then again--an't I  rather too smartly dressed to look like a money-Lender?    SIR PETER. Not at all; 'twould not be out of character, if you went in  your own carriage--would it, Moses!    MOSES. Not in the least.    SIR OLIVER. Well--but--how must I talk[?] there's certainly some cant of  usury and mode of treating that I ought to know.    SIR PETER. Oh, there's not much to learn--the great point as I take it  is to be exorbitant enough in your Demands hey Moses?    MOSES. Yes that's very great Point.    SIR OLIVER. I'll answer for't I'll not be wanting in that--I'll ask him  eight or ten per cent. on the loan--at least.    MOSES. You'll be found out directly--if you ask him no more than that,  you'll be discovered immediately.    SIR OLIVER. Hey!--what the Plague!--how much then?    MOSES. That depends upon the Circumstances--if he appears not very  anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per  cent.--but if you find him in great Distress, and want the monies very  bad--you may ask double.    SIR PETER. A good--[h]onest Trade you're learning, Sir Oliver--    SIR OLIVER. Truly, I think so--and not unprofitable--    MOSES. Then you know--you haven't the monies yourself, but are forced to  borrow them for him of a Friend.    SIR OLIVER. O I borrow it of a Friend do I?    MOSES. And your friend is an unconscion'd Dog--but you can't help it.    SIR OLIVER. My Friend's an unconscionable Dog, is he?    MOSES. Yes--and He himself hasn't the monies by him--but is forced to  sell stock--at a great loss--    SIR OLIVER. He is forced to sell stock is he--at a great loss, is  he--well that's very kind of him--    SIR PETER. Efaith, Sir Oliver--Mr. Premium I mean--you'll soon be master  of the Trade--but, Moses would have him inquire if the borrower is a  minor--    MOSES. O yes--    SIR PETER. And in that case his Conscience will direct him--    MOSES. To have the Bond in another Name to be sure.    SIR OLIVER. Well--well I shall be perfect--    SIR PETER. But hearkee wouldn't you have him also run out a little  against the annuity Bill--that would be in character I should think--    MOSES. Very much--    ROWLEY. And lament that a young man now must be at years of discretion  before He is suffered to ruin himself!    MOSES. Aye, great Pity!    SIR PETER. And abuse the Public for allowing merit to an act whose only  object is to snatch misfortune and imprudence from the rapacious Relief  of usury! and give the minor a chance of inheriting his estate without  being undone by coming into Possession.    SIR OLIVER. So--so--Moses shall give me further instructions as we go  together.    SIR PETER. You will not have much time[,] for your Nephew lives hard  bye--    SIR OLIVER. Oh Never--fear[:] my Tutor appears so able that tho' Charles  lived in the next street it must be my own Fault if I am not a compleat  Rogue before I turn the Corner--         [Exeunt SIR OLIVER and MOSES.]    SIR PETER. So--now I think Sir Oliver will be convinced--you shan't  follow them Rowley. You are partial and would have prepared Charles for  'tother plot.    ROWLEY. No upon my word Sir Peter--    SIR PETER. Well, go bring me this Snake, and I'll hear what he has to  say presently. I see Maria, and want to speak with her.--         [Exit ROWLEY.]  I should be glad to be convinced my suspicions of Lady Teazle and  Charles were unjust--I have never yet opened my mind on this subject to  my Friend Joseph. . . . I am determined. I will do it--He will give me  his opinion sincerely.--         Enter MARIA    So Child--has Mr. Surface returned with you--    MARIA. No Sir--He was engaged.    SIR PETER. Well--Maria--do you not reflect[,] the more you converse with  that amiable young man[,] what return his Partiality for you deserves?    MARIA. Indeed Sir Peter--your frequent importunity on this subject  distresses me extremely--you compell me to Declare that I know no man  who has ever paid me a particular Attention whom I would not prefer to  Mr. Surface--    SIR PETER. Soh! Here's Perverseness--no--no--Maria, 'tis Charles only  whom you would prefer--'tis evident his Vices and Follies have won your  Heart.    MARIA. This is unkind Sir--You know I have obey'd you in neither seeing  nor corresponding with him--I have heard enough to convince me that  He is unworthy my regard--Yet I cannot think it culpable--if while my  understanding severely condemns his Vices, my Heart suggests some Pity  for his Distresses.    SIR PETER. Well well pity him as much as you please, but give your Heart  and Hand to a worthier object.    MARIA. Never to his Brother!    SIR PETER. Go--perverse and obstinate! but take care, Madam--you have  never yet known what the authority of a Guardian is--don't compel me to  inform you of it.--    MARIA. I can only say, you shall not have just Reason--'tis true, by  my Father's will I am for a short period bound to regard you as his  substitute, but I must cease to think you so when you would compel me to  be miserable.         [Exit.]    SIR PETER. Was ever man so crossed as I am[?] everything conspiring to  fret me! I had not been involved in matrimony a fortnight[,] before  her Father--a hale and hearty man, died on purpose, I believe--for the  Pleasure of plaguing me with the care of his Daughter . . . but here  comes my Helpmate!--She appears in great good humour----how happy I  should be if I could teaze her into loving me tho' but a little----         Enter LADY TEAZLE    LADY TEAZLE. Lud! Sir Peter I hope you haven't been quarrelling with  Maria? It isn't using me well to be ill humour'd when I am not bye--!    SIR PETER. Ah! Lady Teazle you might have the Power to make me good  humour'd at all times--    LADY TEAZLE. I am sure--I wish I had--for I want you to be in a charming  sweet temper at this moment--do be good humour'd now--and let me have  two hundred Pounds will you?    SIR PETER. Two hundred Pounds! what an't I to be in a good humour  without paying for it--but speak to me thus--and Efaith there's nothing  I could refuse you. You shall have it--but seal me a bond for the  repayment.    LADY TEAZLE. O no--there--my Note of Hand will do as well--    SIR PETER. And you shall no longer reproach me with not giving you an  independent settlement--I shall shortly surprise you--and you'll not  call me ungenerous--but shall we always live thus--hey?    LADY TEAZLE. If you--please--I'm sure I don't care how soon we leave off  quarrelling provided you'll own you were tired first--    SIR PETER. Well--then let our future contest be who shall be most  obliging.    LADY TEAZLE. I assure you Sir Peter Good Nature becomes you--you look  now as you did before we were married--when you used to walk with me  under the Elms, and tell me stories of what a Gallant you were in your  youth--and chuck me under the chin you would--and ask me if I thought I  could love an old Fellow who would deny me nothing--didn't you?    SIR PETER. Yes--yes--and you were as kind and attentive----    LADY TEAZLE. Aye so I was--and would always take your Part, when my  acquaintance used to abuse you and turn you into ridicule--    SIR PETER. Indeed!    LADY TEAZLE. Aye--and when my cousin Sophy has called you a stiff  peevish old batchelor and laugh'd at me for thinking of marrying one who  might be my Father--I have always defended you--and said I didn't think  you so ugly by any means, and that you'd make a very good sort of a  husband--    SIR PETER. And you prophesied right--and we shall certainly now be the  happiest couple----    LADY TEAZLE. And never differ again.    SIR PETER. No never--tho' at the same time indeed--my dear Lady  Teazle--you must watch your Temper very narrowly--for in all our little  Quarrels--my dear--if you recollect my Love you always began first--    LADY TEAZLE. I beg your Pardon--my dear Sir Peter--indeed--you always  gave the provocation.    SIR PETER. Now--see, my Love take care--contradicting isn't the way to  keep Friends.    LADY TEAZLE. Then don't you begin it my Love!    SIR PETER. There now--you are going on--you don't perceive[,] my Life,  that you are just doing the very thing my Love which you know always  makes me angry.    LADY TEAZLE. Nay--you know if you will be angry without any reason--my  Dear----    SIR PETER. There now you want to quarrel again.    LADY TEAZLE. No--I am sure I don't--but if you will be so peevish----    SIR PETER. There--now who begins first?    LADY TEAZLE. Why you to be sure--I said nothing[--]but there's no  bearing your Temper.    SIR PETER. No--no--my dear--the fault's in your own temper.    LADY TEAZLE.

Exert ye with heart and soul, so that association,  love, unity and agreement be obtained between the hearts, all the aims may  be merged into one aim, all the songs become one song and the power of the  Holy Spirit may become so overwhelmingly victorious as to overcome all the  forces of the world of nature. Exert yourselves; your mission is  unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise, America will  assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will  emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plentitude of  its majesty and glory, be firmly established.    12 This phenomenal world will not remain in an unchanging condition even  for a short while. Second after second it undergoes change and  transformation. Every foundation will finally become collapsed; every  glory and splendor will at last vanish and disappear, but the Kingdom of  God is eternal and the heavenly sovereignty and majesty will stand firm,  everlasting. Hence in the estimation of a wise man the mat in the Kingdom  of God is preferable to the throne of the government of the world.    13 Continually my ear and eye are turned toward the Central States;  perchance a melody from some blessed souls may reach my ears--souls who are  the dawning-places of the love of God, the stars of the horizon of  sanctification and holiness--souls who will illumine this dark universe and  quicken to life this dead world. The joy of 'Abdu'l-Baha depends upon  this! I hope that you may become confirmed therein.    14 Consequently, those souls who are in a condition of the utmost  severance, purified from the defects of the world of nature, sanctified  from attachment to this earth, vivified with the breaths of eternal  life--with luminous hearts, with heavenly spirit, with attraction of  consciousness, with celestial magnanimity, with eloquent tongues and with  clear explanations--such souls must hasten and travel through all parts of  the Central States. In every city and village they must occupy themselves  with the diffusion of the divine exhortations and advices, guide the souls  and promote the oneness of the world of humanity. They must play the  melody of international conciliation with such power that every deaf one  may attain hearing, every extinct person may be set aglow, every dead one  may obtain new life and every indifferent soul may find ecstasy. It is  certain that such will be the consummation.    Let the spreaders of the fragrances of God recite this prayer every  morning:    O LORD, my God! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee for Thou hast guided  me to the highway of the kingdom, suffered me to walk in this straight and  far-stretching path, illumined my eye by beholding the splendors of Thy  light, inclined my ear to the melodies of the birds of holiness from the  kingdom of mysteries and attracted my heart with Thy love among the  righteous.    O Lord! Confirm me with the Holy Spirit, so that I may call in Thy Name  amongst the nations, and give the glad tidings of the manifestation of Thy  kingdom amongst mankind.    O Lord! I am weak, strengthen me with Thy power and potency. My tongue  falters, suffer me to utter Thy commemoration and praise. I am lowly,  honor me through admitting me into Thy kingdom. I am remote, cause me to  approach the threshold of Thy mercifulness. O Lord! Make me a brilliant  lamp, a shining star and a blessed tree, adorned with fruit, its branches  overshadowing all these regions. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful  and Unconstrained.            12: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE WESTERN STATES      _Revealed on February 15, 1917, in Baha'u'llah's room at the house of  Abbud in Akka, and addressed to the Baha'is of the eleven Western States  of the United States: New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California,  Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye friends and the maidservants of the Merciful, the chosen ones of the  Kingdom:    2 The Blessed state of California bears the utmost similarity to the Holy  Land, that is, the country of Palestine. The air is of the utmost  temperance, the plain very spacious, and the fruits of Palestine are seen  in that state in the utmost of freshness and delicacy. When 'Abdu'l-Baha  was traveling and journeying through those states, he found himself in  Palestine, for from every standpoint there was a perfect likeness between  this region and that state. Even the shores of the Pacific Ocean, in some  instances, show perfect resemblance to the shores of the Holy Land--even  the flora of the Holy Land have grown on those shores--the study of which  had led to much speculation and wonder.    3 Likewise, in the state of California and other Western states, wonderful  scenes of the world of nature, which bewilder the minds of men, are  manifest. Lofty mountains, deep canyons, great and majestic waterfalls,  and giant trees are witnessed on all sides, while its soil is in the  utmost fertility and richness. That blessed state is similar to the Holy  Land and that region and that country like unto a delectable paradise, is  in many ways identical with Palestine. Now just as there are natural  resemblances, heavenly resemblances must also be acquired.    4 The lights of the divine traces are manifest in Palestine. The majority  of the Israelitish Prophets raised the call of the Kingdom of God in this  holy ground. Having spread the spiritual teachings, the nostrils of the  spiritually-minded ones became fragrant, the eyes of the illumined souls  became brightened, the ears were thrilled through this song, the hearts  obtained eternal life from the soul-refreshing breeze of the Kingdom of  God and gained supreme illumination from the splendor of the Sun of  Reality. Then from this region the light was spread to Europe, America,  Asia, Africa and Australia.    5 Now California and the other Western States must earn an ideal  similarity with the Holy Land, and from that state and that region the  breaths of the Holy Spirit be diffused to all parts of America and Europe,  that the call of the Kingdom of God may exhilarate and rejoice all the  ears, the divine principles bestow a new life, the different parties may  become one party, the divergent ideas may disappear and revolve around one  unique center, the East and the West of America may embrace each other,  the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life  upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be  pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified  with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world,  the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration, and just as in the  state of California and other Western States the marvelous scenes of the  world of nature are evident and manifest, the great signs of the Kingdom  of God may also be unveiled so that the body may correspond with the  spirit, the outward world may become a symbol of the inward world, and the  mirror of the earth may become the mirror of the Kingdom, reflecting the  ideal virtues of heaven.    6 During My journey and traveling in those parts, I beheld wonderful  scenes and beautiful panoramas of nature, orchards and rivers; national  parks and general conclaves; deserts, plains, meadows and prairies; and  the grains and fruits of that region greatly attracted My attention; even  to the present moment they are in My mind.    7 Particularly was I greatly pleased with the meetings in San Francisco  and Oakland, the gatherings in Los Angeles, and the believers who came  from the cities of other states. Whenever their faces cross My memory,  immediately infinite happiness is realized.    8 Therefore I hope that the divine teachings like unto the rays of the sun  may be diffused in all the Western States, and the blessed verse of the  Qur'an, \"It is a good City and the Lord is the Forgiver!\"(17) may become  realized. Likewise, the significance of another Qur'anic verse, \"Do ye not  travel through the land?\"(18) and of the verse, \"Behold the traces of the  Mercy of God!\"(19) become revealed in the utmost effulgence.    9 Praise be to God that through the divine bounty and providence, in that  region the field of service is vast, the minds are in the utmost degree of  intelligence and progress, sciences and arts are being promoted, the  hearts like unto mirrors are in the utmost state of purity and  translucency, and the friends of God are in perfect attraction. Therefore  it is hoped that meetings for teaching will be organized and instituted,  and for the diffusion of the fragrances of God wise teachers may be sent  to cities, even to villages.    10 The teachers of the Cause must be heavenly, lordly and radiant. They  must be embodied spirit, personified intellect, and arise in service with  the utmost firmness, steadfastness and self-sacrifice. In their journeys  they must not be attached to food and clothing. They must concentrate  their thoughts on the outpourings of the Kingdom of God and beg for the  confirmations of the Holy Spirit. With a divine power, with an attraction  of consciousness, with heavenly glad tidings and celestial holiness they  must perfume the nostrils with the fragrances of the Paradise of Abha.    The following commune is to be read by them every day:    O GOD! O God! This is a broken-winged bird and his flight is very  slow--assist him so that he may fly toward the apex of prosperity and  salvation, wing his way with the utmost joy and"]]]
