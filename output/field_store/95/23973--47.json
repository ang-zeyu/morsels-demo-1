So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to  them:    \"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have  decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not  remain here.\"    \"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the  answer.    \"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"  said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies  to make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we will  drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country will  be rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"    \"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of  those growing is yet ripe enough to pick. I am greater than any  thorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Why destroy me?\"    \"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am  informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to  take the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him  to be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to  perform. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or  not.\"    At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of  producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He did  it very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange  piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could  be. But afterward she said:    \"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes nothing of  value. What else can you do?\"    The Wizard tried to think. Then he jointed together the blades of his  sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. But even  that did not satisfy the Princess.    Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil  which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever  idea from those commonplace things.    \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by  creating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit a  Destroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\"    So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and  set a lantern upon each of their heads.    \"Don't laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of my  magic.\"    [Illustration: \"NOW, PRINCESS,\" EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD.]    Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled  face, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. The  glare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of the  six great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. The  Mangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any  light that did not come directly from their suns.    Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,  where it covered quite a broad surface. When he lighted the oil a  hundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.    \"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who  wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within  this circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right,  they will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, the  light will wither him.\"    The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded  them to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were  scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of  baked potatoes. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged  from the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary to  plant them at once.    \"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any  Sorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that my people have  advised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful  Garden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the  Black Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them  around.\"    The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself  that he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had gone  both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit,  and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from  such a fate.    For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between  sleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends  were not disturbed in any way. They were even permitted to occupy the  House of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to  wander in the gardens in search of food.    Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and  walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They  saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and  twisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vines  touched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have  escaped being cast among them.    Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets  from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to  amuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his  glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part  of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could.  They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she  lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.    The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and  watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.    \"Don't be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the  round, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed  the sport very greatly.    Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,  solemn-eyed Mangaboos. Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered  with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the  kitten and the piglets.    \"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being  pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way  of the thorns.    The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to the  doorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they were  driven from the room and out upon the street. Here were more of the  vegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightened  creatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon the  tiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, while  Eureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also tried  to protect the pretty little things from injury. Slowly but steadily the  heartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through the  city and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the  mountain.    \"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape a  thorn.    \"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they  threatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten. \"If I were as big as you  are, Jim, I'd fight these miserable turnip-roots!\"    \"What would you do?\" enquired Jim.    \"I'd kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs.\"    \"All right,\" said the horse; \"I'll do it.\"    An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and  kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could. A dozen of them smashed  together and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked  again and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in  all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron  heels. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and  scratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetable  complexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse.    But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long. They tired Jim and  Eureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered with  mashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at last  and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 7.    INTO THE BLACK PIT AND OUT AGAIN      When they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunk  of deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme.  Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the  point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.    The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this  dark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it seemed  some of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall--they began  to pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners could  not get out again.    \"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim. \"It will be about the end of our  adventures, I guess.\"    \"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"he  would not see us suffer so.\"    \"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\"  added Eureka. \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go and  tell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue.\"    The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave a  leap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the  air. The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up their  thorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her. Eureka,  however, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount only  about a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"   [Illustration: Portrait.]  Baron von Steuben.      [1778]    The British, after a gay winter in Philadelphia, startled by the news  that a French fleet was on its way to America, marched for New York,  June 18,1778. The American army overtook them at Monmouth on the 28th;  General Charles Lee--a traitor as we now know, and as Washington then  suspected, forced into high place by influence in Congress--General Lee  led the party intended to attack, but he delayed so long that the  British attacked him instead.    The Americans were retreating through a narrow defile when Washington  came upon the field, and his Herculean efforts, brilliantly seconded by  Wayne, stayed the rout. A stout stand was made, and the British were  held at bay till evening, when they retired and continued their march to  New York. Washington followed and took up his station at White Plains.        CHAPTER V.    THE NORTHERN CAMPAIGN    [1775]    At the outbreak of hostilities the thoughts of the colonists naturally  turned to the Canadian border, the old battleground of the French and  Indian War. Then and now a hostility was felt for Canada which had not  slumbered since the burning of Schenectady in 1690.    May 10, 1775, Ethan Allen, at the head of a party of \"Green Mountain  Boys,\" surprised Fort Ticonderoga. Crown Point was taken two days later.  Two hundred and twenty cannon, besides other much-needed military  stores, fell into the hands of the Americans. Some of these heavy guns,  hauled over the Green Mountains on oxsleds the next winter, were planted  by Washington on Dorchester Heights.    In November, 1775, St. Johns and Montreal were captured by a small force  under General Montgomery. The Americans now seemed in a fair way to get  control of all Canada, which contained only 700 regular troops. It was  even hoped that Canada would make common cause with the colonies. Late  in the fall Benedict Arnold led 1,000 men up the Kennebec River and  through the wilderness--a terrible journey--to Quebec. Here he was  joined by Montgomery. On the night of December 30th, which was dark and  stormy, Montgomery and Arnold led their joint forces, numbering some  3,000, against the city. Arnold was to attack the lower town, while  Montgomery sought to gain the citadel. Montgomery had hardly passed the  first line of barricades when he was shot dead, and his troops retreated  in confusion. Arnold, too, was early wounded. Morgan, with 500 of his  famous riflemen, forced an entrance into the lower town. But they were  not re-enforced, and after a desperate street fight were taken  prisoners.    [1776]    A dreary and useless blockade was maintained for several months; until  in May the garrison sallied forth and routed the besiegers. The British  were successful in several small engagements during the summer of 1776;  and the Americans finally had to fall back to Crown Point and  Ticonderoga.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Richard Montgomery.      [1777]    In June of the next year a splendid expedition set sail from St. Johns  and swept proudly up Lake Champlain. Eight thousand British and Hessian  troops, under strict discipline and ably officered, forty cannon of the  best make, a horde of merciless Indians--with these forces General  Burgoyne, the commander of the expedition, expected to make an easy  conquest of upper New York, form a junction with Clinton at Albany, and,  by thus isolating New England from the Middle and Southern States, break  the back of the rebellion.    Ticonderoga was the first point of attack. Sugar Loaf Mountain, which  rose six hundred feet above the lake, had been neglected as too  difficult of access. Burgoyne's skilful engineers easily fortified this  on the night of July 4th, and Fort Ticonderoga became untenable. General  St. Clair, with his garrison of 3,000, at once evacuated it, and fled  south under cover of the night. He was pursued, and his rear guard of  1,200 men was shattered. The rest of his force reached Fort Edward.        [Illustration: Four soldiers in battle; two on the left holding muskets,  one just fallen and and an officer with his arms thrown up after being  shot.]  The Death of Montgomery at Quebec.      The loss of Ticonderoga spread alarm throughout the North. General  Schuyler, the head of the Northern department, appealed to Washington  for re-enforcements, and fell back from Fort Edward to the junction of  the Mohawk and Hudson.    Meanwhile Burgoyne was making a toilsome march toward Fort Edward.  Schuyler had destroyed the bridges and obstructed the roads, so that the  invading army was twenty-four days in going twenty-six miles. Up to this  point Burgoyne's advance had been little less than a triumphal march;  difficulties now began to surround him like a net.    Burgoyne had arranged for a branch expedition of 700 troops and 1,000  Indians under St. Leger, to sail up Lake Ontario, sweep across western  New York, and join the main body at Albany. August 3d, this expedition  reached Fort Schuyler, and besieged it. A party of 800 militia, led by  General Herkimer, a veteran German soldier, while marching to relieve  the fort, was surprised by an Indian ambush. The bloody battle of  Oriskany followed. St. Leger's further advance was checked, and soon  after, alarmed by exaggerated reports of a second relief expedition  under Arnold, he hurried back to Canada.    At Bennington, twenty-five miles east of Burgoyne's line of march, the  Americans had a depot of stores and horses. Burgoyne, who was running  short of provisions, sent a body of 500 troops, under Baume, to capture  these stores, and overawe the inhabitants by a raid through the  Connecticut valley. About 2,000 militia hastened to the defence of  Bennington. General Stark, who had fought gallantly at Bunker Hill and  Trenton, took command. August 16th, Baume was attacked on three sides at  once, Stark himself leading the charge against the enemy's front. Again  and again his men dashed up the hill where the British lay behind  breastworks. After a fight of two hours Baume surrendered, overpowered  by superior numbers. Re-enforcements which came up a little later were  driven back with considerable loss. The Americans took 700 prisoners and  1,000 stands of arms.      [Illustration: Herkimer seated against a tree with a leg wound, giving  orders to a soldier.]  General Herkimer at the Battle of Oriskany.      Burgoyne's situation was becoming dangerous. The failure of St. Leger  and the heavy loss at Bennington seriously disarranged his plans. The  troops detached to defend the posts in his rear had reduced his force to  about 6,000. He was greatly hampered by lack of provisions. Meanwhile  the American army had increased to 9,000. Schuyler had been supplanted  by Gates, who on September 12th advanced to a strong position on Bemis  Heights in the town of Stillwater. The right wing of the army rested on  the Hudson, the left on ridges and wood. In front was a ravine. On the  19th Burgoyne advanced to the attack in three columns. That led by  General Fraser, which tried to turn the American left, was the first to  engage. Arnold's wing, including Morgan's riflemen, met Fraser's  skirmishers a mile from the American lines. They were soon forced to  fall back; Burgoyne's central column came up, and the fight became  general. The battleground was covered by thick woods, with occasional  clearings, and the troops fought at close range. Four hours the battle  raged hotly. The British artillery was taken and retaken again and  again. Thirty-six of the forty-eight British gunners were either killed  or wounded. At sunset the Americans withdrew to their fortified lines,  leaving Burgoyne in possession of the field. It was a drawn battle, but  virtually a victory for the Americans. The British lost about 600, the  Americans half as many.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General John Stark.      Burgoyne's situation was now critical in the extreme. In the heart of  the enemy's country, his forces melting away while his opponents were  increasing, nearly out of provisions and his connections with his base  of supplies threatened by a party assailing Ticonderoga, Burgoyne's only  hope was that Clinton would force a passage up the Hudson. But the  latter, after capturing Forts Clinton and Montgomery early in October,  fell back to the lower Hudson and left Burgoyne to his fate.    October 7th, Burgoyne advanced a picked body of 1,500 men to reconnoitre  the American lines. Morgan's riflemen were sent out to \"begin the game.\"  The fighting soon became even hotter than in the previous battle. In an  hour the whole British line was retreating toward the camp. At this  point Arnold, whom, because of his preference for Schuyler, Gates had  deprived of his command, filled with the fury of battle, dashed upon the  field and assumed his old command. The soldiers greeted him with cheers,  and he led them on in one impetuous charge after another. The enemy  everywhere gave way in confusion, and at dusk the Germans were even  driven from their entrenched camp. The British loss was fully 600.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Horatio Gates.      The next day Burgoyne retreated to Saratoga, followed by Gates. The fine  army, which had set out with such high hopes only four months before,  was now almost a wreck. Eight hundred were in the hospital. On the 12th  the army had but five days' rations. Burgoyne could neither advance nor  retreat, and on the 17th he surrendered. The army were allowed free  passage to England on condition that they would not re-engage in the  war. The Americans got 35 superb cannon and 4,000 muskets. The Sunday  after the surrender, Timothy Dwight, afterward President of Yale  College, preached to Gates's soldiers from Joel ii. 20, \"I will remove  far off from you the northern army.\"    Gates deserved little credit for the defeat of Burgoyne.
