But if the birds continue talking, then the man will  live a long time.    The gray screech owl foretells cold weather. When the night is to be  very cold, then the owl cries out; it sounds just as if a person's  teeth chattered. When the owl cries out, all people wrap themselves in  their thickest robes; and they put plenty of wood on the fires.    The Ski-bi-bi-la is a small gray bird, with a black head, and spotted  on the breast. It lives in the woods, and it answers a person who  calls to it. When this bird says, \"Has it returned?\" people are glad.  They know that spring is near. When a boy hears the bird ask this  question, he runs to his mother; she tells him he must answer, \"No; it  has not yet returned.\"    When the people first hear the cry of the nighthawk in the spring,  they begin to talk of hunting buffalo. This is because when the hawk  returns, the buffaloes have become fat again and the birds bring the  news.          THE BIRD CHIEF    _Omaha_      All the birds were called together. To them was said, \"Whichever one  of you can fly farthest into the sky shall be chief.\"    All the birds flew to a great height. But Wren got under the thick  feathers of Eagle and sat there as Eagle flew. When all the birds  became wing-tired, they flew down again; but Eagle flew still higher.  When Eagle had gone as far as he could, Wren flew still higher.    When all the birds reached the ground, Eagle alone returned, after a  great while. Behold! Wren only was absent. So they awaited him. At  last he returned. Eagle had too highly been thinking of himself, being  sure of being made chief; and behold! Wren was made chief.          SONG OF THE BIRDS[H]    _Pawnee_          All around the birds in flocks are flying.      Dipping, rising, circling, see them coming.      See, many birds are flocking here,      All about us now together coming.        Yonder see the birds in flocks, come flying;      Dipping, rising, circling, see them gather.      Loud is the sound their winging makes.      Rushing, come they on the trees alighting.        From the flock an eagle now comes flying;      Dipping, rising, circling, comes she hither.      Loud screams the eagle, flying swift,      As an eagle flies, her nestlings seeking.        It is Kawas coming, Kawas flying;      Dipping, rising, circling, she advances.      See! Nearer she comes, nearer comes.      Now, alighted, she her nest is making.        Yonder people like the birds are flocking;      See them circling, this side, that side coming.      Loud is the sound their moving makes,      As together come they, onward come they.    FOOTNOTE:    [H] Rendition by Alice C. Fletcher.          SONG OF KAWAS, THE EAGLE[I]    _Pawnee_          O'er the prairie flits in ever widening circles the shadow of a          bird about me as I walk;      Upward turn my eyes, Kawas looks upon me, she turns with flapping          wings and far away she flies.        Round about a tree in ever widening circles an eagle flies, alert          watching o'er his nest;      Loudly whistles he, a challenge sending far, o'er the country wide          it echoes, there defying foes.    FOOTNOTE:    [I] Rendition by Alice C. Fletcher.          THE EAGLE'S REVENGE    _Cherokee_      Once a hunter in the mountains heard a noise at night like a rushing  wind. He went outside his tepee, and found an eagle was sitting on the  drying pole, feasting at the deer he had shot. So he shot the eagle.    The next morning the hunter took the deer back to the village. He told  how he had shot the deer and then the eagle. Therefore the chief sent  out men to bring in the eagle, and have an Eagle dance.    That night when they were dancing, there was a _whoop_ outside. A  strange warrior walked into the circle. He was not of that village.  They thought he had come from one of the other Cherokee villages.    This warrior told how he had killed a man. At the end of the story, he  yelled, \"_Hi!_\" One of the men with rattles, who was leading the  dance, fell dead. The stranger sang of another deed. At the end he  yelled, \"_Hi!_\" Another rattler fell dead. The people were frightened.  But the stranger sang of another great deed. Then again he yelled,  \"_Hi!_\" Again a man with the rattles fell dead. So all seven men who  had rattles and who were leading the dance fell dead. And the people  were too frightened to leave the lodge where they were dancing.    Then the stranger vanished into the darkness. Long after they learned  that the stranger was the brother of the eagle that had been killed.          THE RACE BETWEEN HUMMING BIRD AND CRANE    _Cherokee_      Humming Bird and Crane were both in love with a pretty woman. She  liked Humming Bird, who was handsome. Crane was ugly, but he would not  give up the pretty woman. So at last to get rid of him, she told them  they must have a race, and that she would marry the winner. Now  Humming Bird flew like a flash of light; but Crane was heavy and slow.    The birds started from the woman's house to fly around the world to  the beginning. Humming Bird flew off like an arrow. He flew all day  and when he stopped to roost he was far ahead.    Crane flew heavily, but he flew all night long. He stopped at daylight  at a creek to rest. Humming Bird waked up, and flew on again, and soon  he reached a creek, and behold! there was Crane, spearing tadpoles  with his long bill. Humming Bird flew on.    Soon Crane started on and flew all night as before. Humming Bird slept  on his roost.    Next morning Humming Bird flew on and Crane was far, far ahead. The  fourth day, Crane was spearing tadpoles for dinner when Humming Bird  caught up with him. By the seventh day Crane was a whole night's  travel ahead. At last he reached the beginning again. He stopped at  the creek and preened his feathers, and then in the early morning went  to the woman's house. Humming Bird was far, far behind.    But the woman declared she would not marry so ugly a man as Crane.  Therefore she remained single.          RABBIT AND THE TURKEYS    _Omaha_      Rabbit was going somewhere. At length he reached a place where there  were wild Turkeys.    \"Come,\" said Rabbit. \"I will sing dancing songs for you.\"    Turkeys went to him saying, \"Oho! Rabbit will sing dancing songs for  us!\"    \"When I sing for you, you larger ones must go around the circle next  to me. Beware lest you open your eyes. Should one of you open his  eyes, your eyes shall be red,\" said Rabbit.    Then he began to sing,        Alas for the gazer!      Eyes red! Eyes red!      Spread out your tails!      Spread out your tails!    Whenever a large Turkey came near, Rabbit seized it and put it in his  bag. While he was putting in a Turkey, another one opened his eyes a  little, and exclaimed, \"Why! He has captured nearly all of us large  ones!\"    Off they all flew with a whirring sound.    Rabbit took home those he had in his bag, saying to his grandmother,  \"Do not look at what is in that bag! I have brought it home on my back  and I wish you to guard it!\"    Then he went out to cut spits on which to roast the Turkeys. When the  old woman was alone, she thought, \"What could he have brought home on  his back?\" So she untied the bag, and when she looked in out flew all  the Turkeys, hitting their wings hard against the grass lodge, and  flying out the smoke hole. The old woman barely killed one by hitting  it. At length Rabbit came home.    \"Oh I have inflicted a severe injury on my grandchild,\" she said.    \"Really,\" he answered. \"Grandmother, I told you not to look at it.\"    But that is why Turkeys have red eyes.

Out  on the lake there were a great many ducks, geese, and swans swimming.  When Unktomi saw them he went backward out of sight, and picking some  grass, bound it up in a bundle. He placed this on his back and so went  again along by the side of the lake.    \"Unktomi, what are you carrying?\" asked the ducks and the geese and  the swans.    \"These are bad songs I am carrying,\" said Unktomi.    The ducks said, \"Unktomi, sing for us.\"    Unktomi replied, \"But the songs are very bad.\"    But the ducks insisted upon it. Then Unktomi said, \"Make a grass  lodge.\" So they went to work and made a large grass lodge.    \"Now, let all the ducks, geese, and swans gather inside the lodge and  I will sing for you,\" said Unktomi. So all the ducks and the geese and  the swans gathered inside and filled the grass lodge. Then Unktomi  took his place at the door of the lodge and said, \"If I sing for  you, no one must look, for that is the meaning of the song.\"    Then he began to sing,        Dance with your eyes shut;      If you open your eyes      Your eyes shall be red!      Your eyes shall be red!    When he said and sang this, the geese, ducks, and swans danced with  their eyes shut. Then Unktomi rose up "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22089"],[0,"The Liberty Minstrel (#8)"],[1,"e,      Whom he died to save.

Air, \"The Rose that all are praising.\"      [Music]    Oh, he is not the man for me,    Who buys or sells a slave,  Nor he who will not set him free,    But sends him to his grave;  But he whose noble heart beats warm    For all men's life and liberty;  Who loves alike each human form--    Oh that's the man for me,    Oh that's the man for me,    Oh that's the man for me.    He's not at all the man for me,    Who sells a man for gain,  Who bends the pliant servile knee,    To Slavery's God of shame!  But he whose God-like form erect    Proclaims that all alike are free  To think, and speak, and vote, and act,    Oh that's the man for me.    He sure is not the man for me    Whose spirit will succumb,  When men endowed with Liberty    Lie bleeding, bound and dumb;  But he whose faithful words of might    Ring through the land from shore to sea,  For man's eternal equal right,    Oh that's the man for me.    No, no, he's not the man for me    Whose voice o'er hill and plain,  Breaks forth for glorious liberty,    But binds himself, the chain!  The mightiest of the noble band    Who prays and toils the world to free,  With head, and heart, and voice, and vote--    Oh that's the man for me.          PILGRIM SONG.    Words by Geo. Lunt. Air \"Troubadour.\"      [Music]    Over the mountain wave    See where they come;  Storm-cloud and wintry wind    Welcome them home;  Yet where the sounding gale    Howls to the sea,  There their song peals along,    Deep toned and free.      Pilgrims and wanderers,      Hither we come;      Where the free dare to be,      This is our home.    England hath sunny dales,    Dearly they bloom;  Scotia hath heather-hills,    Sweet their perfume:  Yet through the wilderness    Cheerful we stray,  Native land, native land--    Home far away!      Pilgrims, &c.    Dim grew the forest path,    Onward they trod:  Firm beat their noble hearts,    Trusting in God!  Gray men and blooming maids,    High rose their song--  Hear it sweep, clear and deep    Ever along!      Pilgrims, &c.    Not theirs the glory-wreath,    Torn by the blast;  Heavenward their holy steps,    Heavenward they passed!  Green be their mossy graves!    Ours be their fame,  While their song peals along,    Ever the same!      Pilgrims, &c.          The Bondman.    FROM THE LIBERATOR.      Feebly the bondman toiled,    Sadly he wept--  Then to his wretched cot    Mournfully crept:  How doth his free-born soul    Pine 'neath his chain!  Slavery! Slavery!    Dark is thy reign.    Long ere the break of day,    Roused from repose,  Wearily toiling    Till after its close--  Praying for freedom,    He spends his last breath:  Liberty! Liberty!    Give me, or death.    When, when, oh Lord! will right    Triumph o'er wrong?  Tyrants oppress the weak,    Oh Lord! how long?  Hark! hark! a peal resounds    From shore to shore--  Tyranny! Tyranny!    Thy reign is o'er.    E'en now the morning    Gleams from the East--  Despots are feeling    Their triumph is past--  Strong hearts are answering    To freedom's loud call--  Liberty! Liberty!    Full and for all.          FOURTH OF JULY.    Words by Mrs. Sigourney. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    We have a goodly clime,    Broad vales and streams we boast;  Our mountain frontiers frown sublime,    Old Ocean guards our coast.    Suns bless our harvests fair,    With fervid smile serene,  But a dark shade is gathering there,    What can its blackness mean?    We have a birth-right proud,    For our young sons to claim--  An eagle soaring o'er the cloud,    In freedom and in fame.    We have a scutcheon bright,    By our dead fathers bought;  A fearful blot distains its white--    Who hath such evil wrought?    Our banner o'er the sea    Looks forth with starry eye,  Emblazoned glorious, bold and free,    A letter on the sky--    What hand with shameful stain,    Hath marred its heavenly blue?  The yoke, the fasces, and the chain,    Say, are these emblems true?    This day doth music rare    Swell through our nation's bound,  But Afric's wailing mingles there,    And Heaven doth hear the sound.    O God of power! we turn    In penitence to thee,  Bid our loved land the lesson learn--    To bid the slave be free.          YE SPIRITS OF THE FREE.    Air--\"My faith looks up to thee.\"      [Music]    Ye spirits of the free,  Can ye for ever see    Your brother man  A yoked and scourged slave,  Chains dragging to his grave,  And raise no hand to save?    Say if you can.    In pride and pomp to roll,  Shall tyrants from the soul    God's image tear,  And call the wreck their own,--  While from th' eternal throne,  They shut the stifled groan,    And bitter prayer?    Shall he a slave be bound,  Whom God hath doubly crowned    Creation's lord?  Shall men of Christian name,  Without a blush of shame,  Profess their tyrant claim    From God's own word?    No! at the battle cry,  A host prepared to die,    Shall arm for fight--  But not with martial steel,  Grasped with a murderous zeal;  No arms their foes shall feel,    But love and light.    Firm on Jehovah's laws,  Strong in their righteous cause,    They march to save.  And vain the tyrant's mail,  Against their battle-hail,  Till cease the woe and wail    Of tortured slave!          Sing Me a Triumph Song.      Sing me a triumph song,  Roll the glad notes along,    Great God, to thee!  Thine be the glory bright,  Source of all power and might!  For thou hast said, in might,    Man shall be free.    Sing me a triumph song,  Let all the sound prolong,    Air, earth, and sea,  Down falls the tyrant's power,  See his dread minions cower;  Now, from this glorious hour,    Man will be free.    Sing me a triumph song,  Sing in the mighty throng,    Sing Jubilee!  Let the broad welkin ring,  While to heaven's mighty King,  Honor and praise we sing,    For man is free.          WAKE, SONS OF THE PILGRIMS.    Air--\"M'Gregor's Gathering.\"      [Music]    Wake, sons of the Pilgrims, and look to your right!  The despots of Slav'ry are up in their might:  Indulge not in sleep, it's like digging the graves  Of blood-purchased freedom--'tis yielding like slaves.  Then halloo, halloo, halloo to the contest,  Awake from your slumbers, no longer delay,  But struggle for freedom, while struggle you may--  Then rally, rally, rally, rally, rally, rally,  While our forests shall wave or while rushes a river,  Oh, yield not your birth-right! maintain it for ever!    Wake, Sons of the Pilgrims! why slumber ye on?  Your chains are now forging, your fetters are done;  Oh! sleep not, like Samson, on Slavery's foul arm,  For, Delilah-like, she's now planning your harm.  Then halloo, halloo, halloo, to the contest!  Awake from your sleeping--nor slumber again,  Once bound in your fetters, you'll struggle in vain;  While your eye-balls may move, O wake up now, or never--  Wake, freemen! awake, or you're ruined forever!    Yes, freemen are waking! we fling to the breeze,  The bright flag of freedom, the banner of Peace;  The slave long forgotten, forlorn, and alone,  We hail as a brother--our own mother's son!  Then halloo, halloo, halloo, to the contest!  For freedom we rally--for freedom to all--  To rescue the slave, and ourselves too from thrall.  We rally, rally, rally, rally, rally, rally--  While a slave shall remain, bound, the weak by the stronger,  We will never disband, but strive harder and longer.          OUR COUNTRYMEN ARE DYING.    Words by C.W. Dennison. Tune--\"From Greenland's Icy Mountains.\"      [Music]    Our countrymen are dying    Beneath their cankering chains,  Full many a heart is sighing,    Where nought but slav'ry reigns;  No note of joy and gladness,    No voice with freedom's lay,  Fall on them in their sadness,    To wipe those tears away.    Where proud Potomac dashes    Along its northern strand,  Where Rappahannock lashes    Virginia's sparkling sand;  Where Eutaw, famed in story,    Flows swift to Santee's stream,  There, there in grief and gory,    The pining slave is seen!    And shall New England's daughters,    Descendants of the free,  Beside whose far-famed waters    Is heard sweet minstrelsy--  Shall they, when hearts are breaking,    And woman weeps in woe,  Shall they, all listless waiting,    No hearts of pity show.    No! let the shout for freedom    Ring out a certain peal,  Let sire and youthful maiden,    All who have hearts to feel,  Awake! and with the blessing    Of Him who came to save,  A holy, peaceful triumph,    Shall greet the kneeling slave!          We ask not Martial Glory.      We ask not \"martial glory,\"    Nor \"battles bravely won;\"  We tell no boastful story    To laud our \"favorite son;\"  We do not seek to gather    From glory's field of blood,  The laurels of the warrior,    Steeped in the crimson flood--    But we can boast that Birney    Holds not the tyrant's rod,  Nor binds in chains and fetters,    The image of his God;  No vassal, at his bidding,    Is doomed the lash to feel;  No menial crouches near him,    No Charley's[3] at his heel.    His heart is free from murder,    His hand without its stain;  His head and heart united,    To loose the bondman's chain:  His deeds of noble daring,    Shall make the tyrant cower;  Oppression flees before him,    With all its boasted power.    Soon shall the voice of freedom,    O'er earth its echoes roll--  And earth's rejoicing millions    Be free, from pole to pole.  Then rally round your leader,    Ye friends of liberty;  And let the shout for Birney,    Ring out o'er land and sea.    [Footnote 3: Clay's body servant.]          COME, JOIN THE ABOLITIONISTS.
