He is not much hurt, and it will be a lesson to both him  and his horse.  I am glad to see that he has so much spirit.\"    A short chuckle close by made Mr Rogers turn his head, and he saw that  the Zulu understood his words, and was smiling approval.    \"Brave boy!  Make big hunter warrior, some day,\" said the Zulu.    \"Boss Dick big brave hunter too,\" cried Coffee indignantly, as he went  and laid a hand upon the neck of Dick's horse.  \"Boss Dick go shoot  bok?\"    \"Not now, Coffee,\" replied Dick, smiling; and then the little group  remained watching Jack, who was in full chase of the springbok, which,  as he came nearer, began to skip and bound and gambol together, leaping  over each other's backs, but all the time watching the coming enemy.    It was an exciting time for Jack, and in it he forgot the pain in his  shoulder and the stiffness of his leg.  He had the rifle-barrel ready  cocked, and his feet out of the stirrups, and at last, when he had  galloped up to within a couple of hundred yards, he saw such evident  preparations for flight on the part of the little bok, that he leaped  down, dropped upon one knee, and fired straight at the flying herd.    Before the smoke had risen he had another cartridge in the rifle, and  fired again.  Once more he threw open the breech and loaded--and fired,  though by this time the bok were seven or eight hundred yards away.  But  in spite of the care in the aim taken, no bok fell struggling to the  ground, and Jack rode back slowly to join his father, wondering whether  the bore of his rifle was true, for he knew, he said to himself, that he  had aimed straight.    When he hinted at the possibility of the rifle being in fault, his  father smiled, and Dick gave him so comical a look that Jack said no  more, but rode on silently by the side of the waggon, till, seeing his  disappointment, his father joined him.    \"Why, you foolish boy,\" he exclaimed, \"it was not likely that you would  hit one of those flying bok.  It is a matter of long practice; and even  the Boers, who have studied such shooting for years, often miss.\"    \"But you see, father, I did make such a dreadful mess of it,\" pleaded  Jack.  \"I came off my horse; and then I shot over and over again, and  missed.  I can't help feeling what a muddle I made.\"    \"Well, for my part,\" said his father, \"I am rather glad that you failed.  If you had succeeded, my boy, without effort at the first trial, it  would have made you careless.  These failures will teach you the  necessity for using care, and trying to perfect yourself as a marksman.\"    \"But there'll be no bok for dinner,\" said Jack ruefully.    \"Never mind,\" replied Mr Rogers.  \"I daresay the boys will bring in  something.\"    He was right, for Coffee and Chicory brought in six great plain  partridges, which they had knocked down with their kiris, and these were  roasted at the midday meal, and eaten with the appetite found in the  desert.    As the day wore on, and after the refreshed oxen were once more doing  their duty, the effects of the last night's scare began to show itself,  Peter, Dirk, and Dinny declaring that they had seen lions creeping after  the waggon in the distance, ready to pounce upon the oxen as soon as it  was dark.    Dirk reported this to Mr Rogers, who gave them all a good, talking to  about their cowardice.    \"Why, look at these Zulu boys,\" he cried; \"they don't show any fear,  while you grown men are almost as bad as children.\"    \"Sure, sor, an' the Zulu boys don't know any better,\" said Dinny.  \"They're little better than the bastes themselves.\"    \"Well, there are my own boys,\" exclaimed Mr Rogers.  \"They are not  afraid.  I wonder at you, Dinny, an Irishman, and to set such a bad  example to these blacks.\"    \"And is it afraid?\" said Dinny.  \"Not a bit of it.  I'm not a bit afraid  at all; but I can't help thinking of what my poor mother's feelings  would be if she came to know that her only son Dennis had been aiten up  by wild bastes.  I don't mind a bit, but I wouldn't hurt her feelings  for the world.\"    \"Then oblige me, Dinny, by holding your tongue, for if I hear any more  complaints I shall send you back.\"    \"Sind me back!\" ejaculated Dinny, as soon as his master had gone.  \"Sind  me back across the big desert all alone by meself.  Why, it would be  worse than murther.  It's meself wishes I hadn't come.\"    Whatever he may have wished, these sharp words had the effect of  silencing Dinny for the time being; but when the Zulu had led them at  last, just at sundown, into a dense patch of forest, where the  overhanging trees made the gloom quite oppressive, Dinny's eyes showed  white circles round them; and if it had not been for the fact that they  found a Boer and his family encamped by the water they had been seeking,  the Irishman would have probably turned, and at all risks have fled.    People are ready enough to make friends out in the desert, and the Boer  gladly offered the use of the fire he had made, and a part of the  springbok he had shot, on receiving a share of some of the good things  brought by the newcomers.  Then, with the great camp-kettle simmering  over the fire, and with the boys patiently waiting for their share of  the provisions, guns were cleaned and laid ready for use, the men the  while busily attending to the oxen and horses, while the Zulu and his  boys collected wood into a pile to keep up the fire.    \"Sure an' it's a dreadful melancholy-looking place,\" said Dinny with a  shudder.  And then he listened attentively while the Boer expressed his  belief that there were lions in the neighbourhood, though they were not  often seen.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    HOW NATURE WAS STRONGER THAN TRAINING.    Days and days of steady travel, and the slowly gained miles mounted up  till they had journeyed far into the interior.  Mr Rogers, yielding to  the importunities of his boys, had several times over been ready to come  to a halt; but the Zulu still pointed forward, and feeling that there  must be much truth in his declarations regarding the game country on  ahead, he was allowed to act as guide.    It was a long journey, but though they did not have much sport, it was  not monotonous, for Mr Rogers was a good naturalist, and eager to  collect everything curious in beetle, butterfly, and bird, so that all  hands were pretty busy from dawn to dark.  Coffee and Chicory, after  they had been taught not to pull off the feathers, became very clever at  skinning birds, some of which had been denizens of the woods, some of  the lagoons and marshes they had passed, and which were shot at  daybreak, or else after sunset, from amongst the great beds of reeds.  Then if they were ducks, the bodies became occupants of the great pot;  if they were not considered eatable they fell to the share of the dogs.    That great iron pot, which was always suspended from three poles over  every fire that was made, became an institution.  The idea was taken  from a hint given by a hunting-party, one of the gentlemen forming it  telling Mr Rogers that, upon returning weary and exhausted to camp,  there was nothing so restorative us good rich soup.  Consequently,  whenever a buck was shot, great pieces of its flesh were placed in the  pot, and allowed to stew till all their goodness was gone, when the  blacks considered them a delicacy, the rich soup being the portion of  the hunting-party.    Game was scarce, but they got a sufficiency of either small bok or birds  to supply their wants; and, whether it was the constant change, the  fresh air, the rich meat essence which Dick partook of with avidity, or  whether it was a combination of the effect of all these, the change in  the boy was magical.  He could take a long ride now without feeling  weary, and wanting in appetite; he was ready to buckle to and help when  the waggon was stuck, literally putting his shoulder to the wheel with a  will, and in place of hanging back, he was now the first to spy out  game, and set off in chase, making Jack quite envious by coming back in  triumph with a couple of springbok hanging from his saddle-bows, both  having had to succumb to his rifle.    But this was not to be borne; and Jack at once took Chicory into his  confidence.    \"I must shoot a springbok, Chick,\" he said.  \"Dick has shot two.\"    \"Boss Jack shoot springbok to-morrow,\" said the boy, decisively; and  soon after daybreak roused his young master, and pointed out across the  plain towards the rising sun.    \"Bok,\" he said laconically; and while Jack was giving a finishing touch  or two to his dress, the boy ran off, and began to saddle Stockings,  having the little horse ready by the time Jack was prepared to mount.    The others were not awake, saving the Zulu and Dick, who had the morning  watch; so Jack got off unquestioned, and rode away in the direction  pointed out by Chicory, whose dark eyes made out the presence of the  little bok long before they could be seen by his young master, who began  to think that he had been deceived, and expressed his doubts upon the  point.    But Chicory smiled, and laid his hand upon Jack's arm, pointing to where  some shadow shapes of animals could be seen through the faint mist  hanging over a low clump of hillocks; and with a cry of joy the boy  pressed his horse's sides, and went off at a swinging canter, without  discomposing Chicory in the least, for the boy held on to a strap at the  pummel of the saddle as before, and there being no ant-bear hole in the  way, or, the horse having learned better through his fall, they rapidly  neared the little herd, which began the antics peculiar to these  animals, till the lad was getting close up, when they began to flee at a  tremendous rate.    Quick as thought, Jack had sprung from his saddle, and sent a bullet  after the herd; then another, and another; but all apparently without  result.  Then disappointed and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#8)"],[1," Suddenly, he felt that he could bear his captivity no longer, and he  resolved to try and make his way back to Pennsylvania. The Indians might  kill him, long before he could reach home; but if he staid, he must die  of hunger. He hurried ten or twelve miles eastward, when he came upon  fresh buffalo tracks, and soon caught sight of the buffalo. He shot one  of them, but he could not stop to cook the meat, and he ate it almost  raw. Then the thought of the old man and little child whom he had left  starving in the cabin behind him became too much for him. He remembered  what Tecaughretanego had said of God's care for those who trusted in  him; and he packed up all the meat he could carry, and went back to the  camp. The boy ate ravenously of the half-raw meat, as Smith had done,  but the old man waited patiently till it was well boiled. \"Let it be  done enough,\" he said, when Smith wished to take off the kettle too  soon; and when they had all satisfied their hunger, he made Smith  a speech upon the duty of receiving the bounty of Owaneeyo with  thankfulness. After this, Smith seems to have had no farther thoughts  of running away, and he made no attempt to escape until he had been four  years in captivity. He was then at Caughnewaga, the old Indian village  which the traveler may still see from his steamboat on the St. Lawrence  River near Montreal. He had come to this place with Tecaughretanego and  his little son in an elm-bark canoe, all the way from Detroit; and now,  hearing that a French ship was at Montreal with English prisoners of  war, he stole away from the Indians and got on board with the rest. The  prisoners were shortly afterwards exchanged, and Smith got home to his  friends early in 1760. They had never known whether he had been killed  or captured, and they were overjoyed to see him, though they found him  quite like an Indian in his walk and bearing.    He married, and settled down on a farm, but he was soon in arms against  the Indians. He served as a lieutenant in Bouquet's expedition, and  became a colonel of the Revolutionary army. After the war he took his  family to Kentucky, where he lived until he died in 1812. The Indians  left him unmolested in his reading or writing while he was among  them, and he had kept a journal, which he wrote out in the delightful  narrative of his captivity, first published in 1799. He modestly says in  his preface that the chief use he hopes for it is from his observations  on Indian warfare; but these have long ceased to be of practical value,  while his pictures of Indian life and his studies of Indian character  have a charm that will always last.          VI. THE CAPTIVITY OF BOONE AND KENTON.    Colonel Smith was not the first whose captivity was passed in the  Ohio country, but there is no record of any earlier captivity, though  hundreds of captives were given up to Bouquet by the Indians. In spite  of the treaties and promises on both sides, the fighting went on, and  the wilderness was soon again the prison of the white people whom the  savages had torn from their homes. The Ohio tribes harassed the outlying  settlements of Pennsylvania and Virginia, whose borders widened westward  with every year; but they were above all incensed against the pioneers  of Kentucky. Ohio was their home; there they had their camps and towns;  there they held their councils and festivals; there they buried their  dead and guarded their graves. But Kentucky was the pleasance of all the  nations, the hunting ground kept free by common consent, and left to the  herds of deer, elk, and buffalo, which ranged the woods and savannas,  and increased for the common use. When the white men discovered this  hunter's paradise, and began to come back with their families and waste  the game and fell the trees and plow the wild meadows, no wonder the  Indians were furious, and made Kentucky the Dark and Bloody Ground for  the enemies of their whole race, which they had already made it for one  another in the conflicts between the hunting parties of rival tribes.  It maddened them to find the cabins and the forts of the settlers in the  sacred region where no red man dare pitch his wigwam; and they made a  fierce and pitiless effort to drive out the invaders.    Among these was the famous Daniel Boone. He had heard of the glories of  the land from a hunter who wandered into Kentucky by chance and  returned to North Carolina to tell of it among his neighbors. Two years  afterwards, in 1769, when a man of forty, Boone came to see for himself  the things that he knew by hearsay, and he found that the half had not  been told. But among other surprises in store for him was falling into  the clutches of an Indian hunting party which ambushed him and the  friend who was with him. They both escaped, and soon afterwards Boone's  brother and a neighbor, who had followed him from North Carolina,  chanced upon their camp. Boone's friend was before long shot and  scalped by the Indians; the brother's neighbor was lost in the woods and  devoured by the wolves. Then the brother went home for ammunition, and  Boone was left a whole year alone in the wilderness. The charm of its  life was so great for him that after two years more he returned to North  Carolina, sold his farm, and came to Kentucky with his family. Other  families joined them, and the little settlement founded in the woods  where he had ranged solitary with no friend but his rifle and with foes  everywhere, was called Boonesborough.    The Revolutionary War broke out, and the Ohio Indians, who had hitherto  fought the pioneers as Englishmen, now fought them as Americans with  fresh fury, under the encouragement of the British commandant at  Detroit. In January, of 1778, Boone took thirty of his men, and went to  make salt at the Blue Licks, where, shortly after, while he was hunting  in the woods, he found himself in the midst of two hundred Indian  warriors, who were on their way to attack Boonesborough. He was then  fifty years old, and the young Indians soon overtook him when he tried  to escape by running, and made him their prisoner. His captors treated  him kindly, as their custom was with prisoners, until they decided  what should be done with them, and at the Licks his whole party gave  themselves up on promise of the same treatment. This was glory enough  for the present; the Indians, as they always did when they had won a  victory, went home to celebrate it, and left Boonesborough unmolested.    They took all their prisoners to the town of Old Chillicothe, on the  banks of the Little Miami in Greene County. What became of his men  we are not told; none of them kept a journal, as Smith did, but it is  certain that Boone was adopted into an Indian family as Smith was. The  Indians, in fact, all became fond of him, perhaps because he was so much  like themselves in temperament and behavior, for he was a grave, silent  man, very cold and wary, with a sort of savage calm. He was well versed  in their character, and knew how to play upon their vanity. One of the  few things he seems to have told of his captivity was that when they  asked him to take part in their shooting matches he beat them just often  enough to show them his wonderful skill with the rifle, and then allowed  them the pleasure of beating such a splendid shot as he had proved  himself. But probably he had other engaging qualities, or so it appeared  when the Indians took him with them to Detroit. The British commandant  offered them a ransom of a hundred pounds for him, while several other  Englishmen, who liked and pitied him, pressed him to take money and  other favors from them. Boone stoically refused because he could never  hope to make any return to them, and his red brethren refused because  they loved Boone too well to part with him at any price, and they took  him back to Old Chillicothe with them.    [Illustration: Daniel Boone shooting with the Indians 067]    He never betrayed the anxiety for his wife and children that constantly  tormented him, for fear of rousing the suspicions of the Indians; but  when he reached Old Chillicothe, and found a large party painted and  ready to take the warpath in a new attack upon Boones-borough, he could  bear it no longer. He showed no sign of his misery, however; he joined  the Indians in all their sports as before, but he was always watching  for some chance to escape, and one morning in the middle of June he  stole away from his captors. He made his way a hundred and sixty miles  through the woods, and on the ninth day entered Boonesborough, faint  with the fast which he had broken but once in his long flight, to find  that he had been given up for dead and his family had gone back to North  Carolina.    Boone spent the rest of his days fighting wild men and hunting wild  beasts in Kentucky, until both were well-nigh gone and the tamer life  of civilization pressed closer about him. Then he set out for Missouri,  where he found himself again in the wilderness, and dwelt there in his  beloved solitude till he died. Nothing ever moved him so much as the  memoir which a young man wrote down for him and had printed. He was fond  of having it read to him (for he could not read any more than he could  write), and he would cry out in delight over it, \"All true; not a lie  in it!\" But it is recorded that he once allowed himself to be so far  excited by the heroic behavior of a friend who had saved his life in  an Indian fight, at the risk of his own, as to say, \"You behaved like a  man, that time.\"    This friend was Simon Kenton, or rather Simon Butler, one of the  greatest of all the Indian hunters of Kentucky and Ohio. He had changed  his name to escape pursuit from his old home in Virginia, when he fled  leaving one of his neighbors, as he supposed, dead on the ground after  a fight, and he kept the name he had taken through the rest of his life.  He wandered about on the frontier and in the wilderness beyond"]]]
