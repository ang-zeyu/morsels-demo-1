Yea, to encourage them the more in this trade of breaking and  battering windows down, Cromwell himself, (as 'twas reported,) espying  a little crucifix in a window aloft, which none, perhaps, before had  scarce observed, gets a ladder, and breaks it down zealously with his  own hand.    \"But before I conclude the narrative, I must not forget to tell, how  they likwise broke open the chapterhouse, ransack'd the records, broke  the seals, tore the writings in pieces, specially such as had great  seals annexed unto them, which they took or mistook rather for the  popes bulls. So that a grave and sober person coming into the room at  the time, finds the floor all strewed and covered over with torn  papers, parchments and broken seals; and being astonisht at this sight,  does thus expostulate with them. Gentlemen, (says he,) what are ye  doing? they answered, we are pulling and tearing the popes bulls in  pieces. He replies, ye are much mistaken: for these writings are  neither the popes bulls, nor any thing relating to him. But they are  the evidences of several mens estates, and in destroying these, you  will destroy and undo many. With these they were something perswaded,  and prevailed upon by the same person, to permit him to carry away all  that were left undefaced, by which means, the writings the church hath  now came to be preserved.    \"Such was the souldiers carriage and behaviour all the time during  their stay at Peterburgh, which was a fortnights space: They went to  church duly, but it was only to do mischief, to break and batter the  windows and any carved work that was yet remaining, or to pull down  crosses wheresoever they could find them; which the first founders did  not set up with so much zeal, as these last confounders pulled them  down.    \"Thus, in a short time, a fair and goodly structure was quite stript of  all its ornamental beauty, and made a ruthful spectacle, a very chaos  of desolation and confusion, nothing scarce remaining but only bare  walls, broken seats, and shatter'd windows on every side.    \"And in the time of this publick confusion, two other things hapned not  unworthy of relating: the one for the strangeness, the other for the  sadness of the accident. The first was this, when now the church lay  open to all comers, without locks and bars, and none to look after  them, those specially that lead up to the leads above; two young  children not above five years old, had got up the steeple by  themselves, and having lost their way down, come to the place where the  great bells hang. Here there was a large round space left purposely in  the arch, when first built, for the drawing up bells or any other  things, as there should be occasion. This place used to be safely  closed before, but now it lay wide open, and was between thirty and  forty yards off from the ground. The two children, coming hither and  finding this passage, one, out of his childish simplicity, was for  jumping down: No, (saies the other) let us rather swarm down, there  being a bell rope then hanging down through that place to the  clockhouse below. Now, this last they did, and a gentleman walking  there beneath at that time, sees two children come with that swiftness  down the rope, like arrows from a bow, who were both taken up for dead,  on the place. This hapned on a Sunday ith' afternoon, in sermon time.  The news coming into the parish church, that two children falling off  from the minster were slain, the congregation were exceedingly  disorder'd, so that the preacher could not go on for a time, every  parent fearing it might be their own childrens case; till at length  they understood the truth and certainty of all. For it pleased God by a  strange and wonderful providence to preserve both these children,  having no hurt but only their hands galled by the rope, and their feet  a little stunted by the fall from the clock-house, where they were  thrown off, the rope being fastened there, and this some four or five  yards high. The persons, I suppose, are both living still; and one of  them, (whose father was then one of the chief tradesmen of the town)  since a grave minister, and rector of a parish in Northamptonshire.    \"The other thing that hapned of more fatal consequences was this:--it  being that time of the year when young lads are busie in rifling  jackdaws nests to get their young, a scholar of the free-school, a son  to a parliament officer, was got upon the top of the minster about this  employment; who going along the cieling in the body of the church, and  treading unwarily on some rotten boards, fell down from thence, upon  the loft where the organ now stands, having his pockets filled with  those inauspicious birds, and with the fall from so great a height, was  slain outright and never stirred more.    \"These two things hapned much about the same time, and in the time of  that publick confusion and disorder. But to proceed in our intended  narrative. These things I have related before were indeed the acts of  private persons only, men of wild intemperate zeal, and who had no  commission for what they did, but what was owing to the swords by their  sides. Yet notwithstanding all these things seemed afterwards to be  own'd and approved by the powers then in being, when they sold all the  churches lands, and many fair buildings adjoyning to the minster, were  likewise pulled down and sold by publick order and authority, such were  the cloysters, the old chapter-house, the library, the bishops hall and  chapel at the end of it: the hall was as fair a room as most in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#8)"],[1," test-tubes,  and retorts.  In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.  One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of  dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy  with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor.  A set of steps stood at one  side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and  above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man  to pass through.  At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was  thrown carelessly together.    By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated  all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that  ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face.  He was stiff and cold, and  had clearly been dead many hours.  It seemed to me that not only his  features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most  fantastic fashion.  By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar  instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a  hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine.  Beside it was a torn sheet  of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it.  Holmes glanced at it,  and then handed it to me.    \"You see,\" he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.    In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \"The sign  of the four.\"    \"In God's name, what does it all mean?\" I asked.    \"It means murder,\" said he, stooping over the dead man.  \"Ah, I  expected it.  Look here!\"  He pointed to what looked like a long, dark  thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.    \"It looks like a thorn,\" said I.    \"It is a thorn.  You may pick it out.  But be careful, for it is  poisoned.\"    I took it up between my finger and thumb.  It came away from the skin  so readily that hardly any mark was left behind.  One tiny speck of  blood showed where the puncture had been.    \"This is all an insoluble mystery to me,\" said I.  \"It grows darker  instead of clearer.\"    \"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it clears every instant.  I only  require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\"    We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the  chamber.  He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of  terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,  he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.    \"The treasure is gone!\" he said.  \"They have robbed him of the  treasure!  There is the hole through which we lowered it.  I helped him  to do it!  I was the last person who saw him!  I left him here last  night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.\"    \"What time was that?\"    \"It was ten o'clock.  And now he is dead, and the police will be called  in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am  sure I shall.  But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you don't  think that it was I?  Is it likely that I would have brought you here  if it were I?  Oh, dear! oh, dear!  I know that I shall go mad!\"  He  jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.    \"You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes, kindly, putting  his hand upon his shoulder.  \"Take my advice, and drive down to the  station to report this matter to the police.  Offer to assist them in  every way.  We shall wait here until your return.\"    The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him  stumbling down the stairs in the dark.        Chapter VI    Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration    \"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \"we have half an hour to  ourselves.  Let us make good use of it.  My case is, as I have told  you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of  over-confidence.  Simple as the case seems now, there may be something  deeper underlying it.\"    \"Simple!\" I ejaculated.    \"Surely,\" said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor  expounding to his class.  \"Just sit in the corner there, that your  footprints may not complicate matters.  Now to work!  In the first  place, how did these folk come, and how did they go?  The door has not  been opened since last night.  How of the window?\"  He carried the lamp  across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but  addressing them to himself rather than to me.  \"Window is snibbed on  the inner side. Framework is solid.  No hinges at the side.  Let us  open it.  No water-pipe near.  Roof quite out of reach.  Yet a man has  mounted by the window. It rained a little last night.  Here is the  print of a foot in mould upon the sill.  And here is a circular muddy  mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See  here, Watson!  This is really a very pretty demonstration.\"    I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs.  \"This is not a  footmark,\" said I.    \"It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a  wooden stump.  You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot  with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.\"    \"It is the wooden-legged man.\"    \"Quite so.  But there has been some one else,--a very able and  efficient ally.  Could you scale that wall, doctor?\"    I looked out of the open window.  The moon still shone brightly on that  angle of the house.  We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and,  look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice  in the brick-work.    \"It is absolutely impossible,\" I answered.    \"Without aid it is so.  But suppose you had a friend up here who  lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing  one end of it to this great hook in the wall.  Then, I think, if you  were an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all.  You would  depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the  rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside,  and get away in the way that he originally came.  As a minor point it  may be noted,\" he continued, fingering the rope, \"that our  wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional  sailor.  His hands were far from horny.  My lens discloses more than  one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I  gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin  off his hand.\"    \"This is all very well,\" said I, \"but the thing becomes more  unintelligible than ever.  How about this mysterious ally?  How came he  into the room?\"    \"Yes, the ally!\" repeated Holmes, pensively.  \"There are features of  interest about this ally.  He lifts the case from the regions of the  commonplace.  I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals  of crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves  from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\"    \"How came he, then?\"  I reiterated.  \"The door is locked, the window is  inaccessible.  Was it through the chimney?\"    \"The grate is much too small,\" he answered.  \"I had already considered  that possibility.\"    \"How then?\" I persisted.    \"You will not apply my precept,\" he said, shaking his head.  \"How often  have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible  whatever remains, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, must be the truth?  We know that  he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney.  We also  know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no  concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\"    \"He came through the hole in the roof,\" I cried.    \"Of course he did.  He must have done so. If you will have the kindness  to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room  above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found.\"    He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung  himself up into the garret.  Then, lying on his face, he reached down  for the lamp and held it while I followed him.    The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and  six the other.  The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin  lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam  to beam.  The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell  of the true roof of the house.  There was no furniture of any sort, and  the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.    \"Here you are, you see,\" said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against  the sloping wall.  \"This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof.  I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle  angle.  This, then, is the way by which Number One entered.  Let us see  if we can find any other traces of his individuality.\"    He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the  second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.  For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.  The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,--clear,  well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an  ordinary man.    \"Holmes,\" I said, in a whisper, \"a child has done the horrid thing.\"    He had recovered his self-possession in an instant.  \"I was staggered  for the moment,\" he said, \"but the thing is quite natural.  My memory  failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it.  There is nothing  more to be learned here.  Let us go down.\"    \"What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\" I asked, eagerly,  when we had regained the lower room once more.    \"My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\" said he, with a touch  of impatience.  \"You know my methods.  Apply them, and it will be  instructive to compare results.\"    \"I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\" I answered.    \"It will be clear enough to you soon,\" he said, in an off-hand way.  \"I  think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\"  He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room  on"]]]
