[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19560"],[0,"Applied Eugenics (#8)"],[1,"the  germ-cells of the next generation, and after maturity were ready to be  ejected from the body, and to form new threadworms.    Imagine this process taking place through generation after generation of  threadworms, and one will realize that the germ-plasm was passed on  directly from one generation to the next; that in each generation it  gave rise to body-plasm, but that it did not at any time lose its  identity or continuity, a part of the germ-plasm being always set aside,  undifferentiated, to be handed on to the next generation.    In the light of this example, one can better understand the definition  of germ-plasm as \"that part of the substance of the parents which does  not die with them, but perpetuates itself in their offspring.\" By  bringing his imagination into play, the reader will realize that there  is no limit to the backward continuity of this germ-plasm in the  threadworm. Granted that each species has arisen by evolution from some  other, this germ-cell which is observed in the body of the threadworm,  must be regarded as part of what may well be called a stream of  germ-plasm, that reaches back to the beginning of life in the world. It  will be equally evident that these is no foreordained limit to the  forward extension of the stream. It will continue in some branch, as  long as there are any threadworms or descendants of threadworms in the  world.    The reader may well express doubt as to whether what has been  demonstrated for the threadworm can be demonstrated for the higher  animals, including man. It must be admitted that in many of these  animals conditions are too unfavorable, and the process of embryology  too complicated, or too difficult to observe, to permit as distinct a  demonstration of this continuity of the germ-plasm, wherever it is  sought. But it has been demonstrated in a great many animals; no facts  which impair the theory have been discovered; and biologists therefore  feel perfectly justified in generalizing and declaring the continuity of  germ-plasm to be a law of the world of living things.    Focusing attention on its application to man, one sees that the race  must represent an immense network of lines of descent, running back  through a vast number of different forms of gradually diminishing  specialization, until it comes to a point where all its threads merge in  one knot--the single cell with which it may be supposed that life on  this globe began. Each individual is not only figuratively, but in a  very literal sense, the carrier of the heritage of the whole race--of  the whole past, indeed. Each individual is temporarily the custodian of  part of the \"stuff of life\"; from an evolutionary point of view, he may  be said to have been brought into existence, primarily to pass this  sacred heritage on to the next generation. From Nature's standpoint, he  is of little use in the world, his existence is scarcely justified,  unless he faithfully discharges this trust, passing on to the future  the \"Lamp of Life\" whose fire he has been created to guard for a short  while.    Immortality, we may point out in passing, is thus no mere _hope_ to the  parent: it is a _real possibility_. The death of the huge agglomeration  of highly specialized body-cells is a matter of little consequence, if  the germ-plasm, with its power to reproduce not only these body-cells,  but the mental traits--indeed, we may in a sense say the very soul--that  inhabited them, has been passed on. The individual continues to live, in  his offspring, just as the past lives in him. To the eugenist, life  everlasting is something more than a figure of speech or a theological  concept--it is as much a reality as the beat of the heart, the growth of  muscles or the activity of the mind.    This doctrine of the continuity of germ-plasm throws a fresh light on  the nature of human relationships. It is evident that the son who  resembles his father can not accurately be called a \"chip off the old  block.\" Rather, they are both chips off the same block; and aside from  bringing about the fusion of two distinct strains of germ-plasm, father  and mother are no more responsible for endowing the child with its  characters except in the choice of mate, than is the child for \"stamping  his impress\" on his parents. From another point of view, it has been  said that father and son ought to be thought of as half-brothers by two  different mothers, each being the product of the same strain of paternal  germ-plasm, but not of the same strain of maternal germ-plasm.  Biologically, the father or mother should not be thought of as the  _producer_ of a child, but as the trustee of a stream of germ-plasm  which produces a child whenever the proper conditions arise. Or as Sir  Michael Foster put it, \"The animal body is in reality a vehicle for ova  or sperm; and after the life of the parent has become potentially  renewed in the offspring, the body remains as a cast-off envelope whose  future is but to die.\" Finally to quote the metaphor of J. Arthur  Thomson, one may \"think for a moment of a baker who has a very precious  kind of leaven; he uses much of this in baking a large loaf; but he so  arranges matters by a clever contrivance that part of the original  leaven is always carried on unaltered, carefully preserved for the next  baking. Nature is the baker, the loaf is the body, the leaven is the  germ-plasm, and each baking is a generation.\"    When the respective functions and relative importance, from a genetic  point of view, of germ-plasm and body-plasm are understood, it must be  fairly evident that the natural point of attack for any attempt at race  betterment which aims to be fundamental rather than wholly superficial,  must be the germ-plasm rather than the body-plasm. The failure to hold  this point of view has been responsible for the disappointing results of  much of the sociological theory of the last century, and for the fact  that some of the work now carried on under the name of race betterment  is producing results that are of little or no significance to true race  betterment.    On the other hand, it must be fairly evident, from the pains which  Nature has taken to arrange for the transmission of the germ-plasm from  generation to generation, that she would also protect it from injury  with meticulous care. It seems hardly reasonable to suppose that a  material of this sort should be exposed, in the higher animals at least,  to all the vicissitudes of the environment, and to injury or change from  the chance of outward circumstances.    In spite of these presumptions which the biologist would, to say the  least, consider worthy of careful investigation, the world is full of  well-intentioned people who are anxious to improve the race, and who in  their attempts to do so, wholly ignore the germ-plasm. They see only the  body-plasm. They are devoted to the dogma that if they can change the  body (and what is here said of the body applies equally to the mind) in  the direction they wish, this change will in some unascertainable way be  reproduced in the next generation. They rarely stop to think that man is  an animal, or that the science of biology might conceivably have  something to say about the means by which his species can be improved;  but if they do, they commonly take refuge, deliberately or  unconsciously, in the biology of half a century ago, which still  believed that these changes of the body could be so impressed on the  germ-plasm as to be continued in the following generation.    Such an assumption is made to-day by few who have thoroughly studied the  subject. Even those who still believed in what is conventionally called  \"the inheritance of acquired characteristics\" would be quick to  repudiate any such application of the doctrine as is commonly made by  most of the philanthropists and social workers who are proceeding  without seeking the light of biology. But the idea that these  modifications are inherited is so widespread among all who have not  studied biology, and is so much a part of the tradition of society, that  the question must be here examined, before we can proceed confidently  with our program of eugenics.    The problem is first to be defined.    It is evident that all characters which make up a man or woman, or any  other organism, must be either germinal or acquired. It is impossible to  conceive of any other category. But it is frequently hard to say in  which class a given character falls. Worse still, many persons do not  even distinguish the two categories accurately--a confusion made easier  by the quibble that _all_ characters must be acquired, since the  organism starts from a single cell, which possesses practically none of  the traits of the adult.    What we mean by an inborn character is one whose expression is due to  something which is present in the germ-plasm; one which is inherent and  due to heredity. An acquired character is simply a modification, due to  some cause external to the germ-plasm acting on an inborn character. In  looking at an individual, one can not always say with certainty which  characters are which; but with a little trouble, one can usually reach a  reliable decision. It is possible to measure the variation in a given  character in a group of parents and their children, in a number of  different environments; if the degree of resemblance between parent and  offspring is about the same in each case, regardless of the different  surroundings in which the children may have been brought up, the  character may properly be called germinal. This is the biometric method  of investigation. In practice, one can often reach a decision by much  simpler means: if the character is one that appears at birth, e.g.,  skin color, it is usually safe to assume that it is a germinal  character, unless there is some evident reason for deciding otherwise,  as in the case of a child born with some disease from which the mother  had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#8)"],[1,"the enemy whenever and wherever he can!\"    \"I shall also enlist my troops, and lead them against the enemy,\"  exclaimed Staps, with sparkling eyes. \"But my troops will not be made of  flesh and blood. They will be the songs I sing, and one day I shall  march out with them, and challenge the tyrant to mortal combat! Yes, you  are right in saying, 'Every one must fight after his own fashion, and  according to his power and influence;' let me fight, too, after my  fashion!\"    \"Go and fight, and may the blessings of all the brave follow you!\" said  Schill, placing his hand on the head of the youth. \"Let us take here,  under the German oak, a solemn oath that we will devote our fortunes,  our lives, and our sacred honor, to the fatherland!\"    \"Yes,\" exclaimed Pueckler and Staps, \"we will take that oath!\"    \"Let us,\" said Schill, \"then swear to strive for nothing but to deliver  Germany from the grasp of the tyrant.\"    \"We swear,\" continued Schill, \"to regard ourselves from this hour as  soldiers of the grand army one day to battle for our liberties--to leave  nothing undone in enlisting fresh troops--that our life shall be nothing  but an inexorable and never-flagging struggle against the usurper--that  we will rather die than submit. We vow vengeance against him, and  deliverance to the fatherland!\"    When all had repeated this oath, Schill said, solemnly, \"The German oak  has heard our words, and they are registered on high; now, my friends,  let us go and enter into a new life--a new future. Let us take care of  the body, in order to impart strength to the mind to carry out its  schemes. Come, let us go!\"    They passed on, and soon reached the village, guided by Staps to the  parsonage.    The clergyman joyfully received the officers; his wife prepared her best  rooms for them, and pledged herself, like her husband, to protect them  at the risk of her life, if French soldiers should arrive, and search  the house for wounded Prussians.    \"Now you are safe, and I can go,\" said Frederick Staps, when he was  again alone with his friends, their host having withdrawn to prepare  every thing that was necessary for the comfort of his guests. \"I cannot  stay here any longer, for I have promised my father to proceed without  delay to Leipsic, and I must keep my pledge to him, as I shall keep it  to you. Farewell, friends; may God protect you, and may your deeds fill  the world with your glory, so that the poor merchant's apprentice in  Leipsic may also hear of it!\"    \"The poor merchant's apprentice is also a soldier of our grand army of  the future,\" said Schill; \"we have enlisted him, and he will go and  fulfil his duty to his fatherland.\"    \"Yes, you may depend on it he will do his duty,\" exclaimed Staps, \"and  you will hear of him one day. Farewell, and, please God! we shall meet  again!\"    \"Yes, we shall meet again,\" said the two officers, cordially shaking  hands with the youth, and taking leave of him.    Staps left the room hastily. When he turned round once more at the door,  and greeted the friends with a nod, they saw that his eyes were filled  with tears.    The clergyman's wife now entered to serve up the dinner she herself had  prepared, and there was added a bottle of old Hock from the wine-cellar.    \"In the first place, however,\" said the clergyman to Schill, \"I must see  and dress your arm, sir; I am quite experienced in dressing wounds,  having taken lessons in surgery in order to assist our poor peasants in  case of injuries, and render it unnecessary for them to pay large  doctors' bills. Let me, therefore, be your surgeon, too.\"    Schill gratefully accepted his kind offer, and after his wife had  brought every thing necessary for dressing a wound, the clergyman  examined Schill's arm, and removed the coagulated blood from it.    \"It is a very deep flesh-wound,\" he said, \"fortunately the bone is  uninjured.\"    \"Then I shall soon be able to use my arm again?\" asked Schill, joyfully.    \"Not for a few weeks yet, unless you wish to run the risk of losing it  entirely. Mortification might set in after the wound has commenced  ulcerating. Hence, you must be very cautious, and live as quietly as  possible. Your hands are now already burning, and your fever will be  very severe. Unfortunately, I have brought up my wine in vain. Both of  you, gentlemen, will not be able to drink it to-day, nor to-morrow, nor  the day after to-morrow either. For the first three days your fever, as  I stated already, will be very serious.\"    This prediction was fulfilled. For three days the officers were unable  to rise from their couch. They were delirious, and unaware of the danger  menacing them. A French regiment had come to the village to spend the  night, and four of its officers established their headquarters at the  parsonage.    But as soon as the French troops had been descried in the neighborhood  of the village, the clergyman, assisted by his wife and servants, had  removed the wounded, and prepared a safe refuge for them in the hay-loft  of his barn, far from the dwelling-house. He himself remained with them,  and, while his wife received the French officers, and informed them that  her husband was not at home, the good old man was sitting in the  hay-loft beside his guests, nursing them with the kindness of a father  and the skill of an experienced physician. He had locked the door of his  asylum, and a loaded gun and unsheathed sword were within his reach, in  order forcibly to drive back the French, in case they should try to  penetrate into this hiding-place.    But the danger passed, and the fever abated. Four days afterward the two  Prussians were strong enough to continue their journey. The clergyman  himself drove them in his carriage to the neighboring town, where they  bought two horses and departed--not together, however, but by different  routes. Count Pueckler took the road to Breslau; Ferdinand von Schill  turned toward Kolberg.    Before parting, they cordially shook hands once more.    \"Let us remember the oath under the German oak,\" said Schill.    \"Yes,\" replied Pueckler. \"We shall not desert the fatherland, but serve  it with our whole strength, and after that is exhausted, we know how to  die.\"          CHAPTER IV.    IN BERLIN.      The utmost uneasiness and suspense prevailed in Berlin. Several rumors  had already reached the capital. It was reported that, on the 14th of  October, a battle had taken place between the Prussians and French  forces. To-day was the 18th, and no news had been received; nothing  definite was known about the result of the battle. But the people said,  if it had been favorable to the Prussians, the couriers, to whom joy  would have lent wings, would have reached the capital long since; and  this continued silence and incertitude seemed to the inhabitants of  Berlin more discouraging than any positive intelligence, however  disastrous it might be.    No one had the heart to work longer--no one could be prevailed upon to  follow his usual avocation; all felt paralyzed by a secret terror; and  hastened into the street, as though they hoped some decisive news would  fly through the air and put an end to this dreadful suspense.    All Berlin seemed to have met in the streets on the morning of this 18th  October, and the people hastened in vast crowds toward the house of the  governor of the capital; they consisted to-day not only of the lower  classes of society but the noblest and best had united with them. Men of  mind and education, the representatives of art and science, were to be  seen among them. There was no distinction of rank or position--every one  felt that he was united with his fellow-citizens by the same care,  anxiety, and affection; every one knew that all the thousands  surrounding him entertained the same wishes and apprehensions, and thus  social distinctions were unnoticed. The high-born and the rich, the poor  and the lowly, all felt only that they were Prussians--that they were  Germans; all were animated by one desire; to learn what had been the  result of the battle, and whether the Prussians, faithful to their  ancient military glory, had defeated the enemy, or, like the other  nations, succumbed to Napoleon.    Thousands hastened, therefore, to the residence of the governor of  Berlin, Count von Schulenburg, and called vociferously for him. When the  count appeared on the balcony and asked what the crowd wanted, hundreds  of voices shouted in thundering chorus: \"We want to know whether the  army has fought a battle, and whether it was defeated!\"    Count Schulenburg shrugged his shoulders, and amid the silence that  ensued his ringing voice was heard to say: \"I have not yet received any  definite intelligence; but so soon as I have it, I shall deem it  incumbent upon me to communicate it to the citizens of Berlin.\"    The governor returned with tottering steps into his house. For a moment  the people remained silent, and seemed still to listen to the words they  had just heard; but suddenly a loud, powerful voice shouted: \"If the  governor does not know any thing, perhaps Professor Lange does. He has  established a newspaper for the special purpose of communicating to us  the latest news from the seat of war; let us go to his house and ask him  what the _Telegraph_ says.\"[8]    [Footnote 8: The _Telegraph_ was a journal founded by a certain  Professor Lange, on the day when the Prussian army left Berlin. In his  prospectus he spoke in the most fulsome terms of the \"invincible army of  Frederick the Great,\" and promised to publish always the latest news  from the seat of war.]    \"Yes, yes, let us go to his house and ask him what the _Telegraph_  says!\" yelled the crowd. \"Where does Professor Lange live? Who can guide  us to him?\"    \"I can do so,\" said the same voice that had spoken before. \"Professor  Lange lives at 22 Leipsic Street.\"    \"Come, come, let us go to Professor Lange! Let us hear what the  _Telegraph_ says!\""]]]
