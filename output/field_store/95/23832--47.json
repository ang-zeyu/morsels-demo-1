The assertion that you  have been 'provoked' will not avail you much: I know that Digby is  teasing and provoking, and is therefore very wrong, but if you cannot  bear a little teasing, how are you to get on in the world? You are  not a baby now, though you have acted more like a wild beast than  a reasonable creature. I am willing and desirous to believe that  something more than usual has been the cause of this ebullition of  temper, for I hoped lately that you were endeavoring to overcome this  sad propensity of yours.\"    \"I assure you, sir,\" said Reginald, raising his open countenance to his  master's, \"I tried very much to bear with Frank, and I think I should  if he had not said so much about--about--\"    Here Reginald's voice failed; a sensation of choking anger prevented  him from finishing his sentence.    \"About what?\" said the doctor, steadily.    \"About my brother,\" said Reginald, abruptly.    \"And what did he say about your brother that chafed you so much?\"    Reginald changed color, and his eyes' lighted up with passion. He did  not reply at first, but as his master seemed quietly awaiting his answer,  he at length burst out,--    \"He had been going on all the afternoon about Louis: he tried to put  me in a passion; he said all he could--every thing that was unkind and  provoking, and it was more than a fellow could stand. I bore it as long  as I could--\"    \"You are giving me a proof of your gentle endurance now, I suppose,\"  said the doctor.    \"I beg your pardon, sir, but I can't help it,--I feel so angry when I  think of it, that I am afraid I should knock him down again if he were  to repeat it.\"    \"For shame, sir!\" said the doctor, sternly; \"I should have thought that  you had already had a lesson you would not easily have forgotten. What  did he say of your brother that irritated you? I insist upon knowing.\"    \"He said Louis was--that Louis did not speak the truth, sir. He said  that I believed it--that _I_ believed it\"--and Reginald's passionate  sobs choked his utterance.    \"Believed what?\" asked the doctor.    \"Something that happened yesterday,\" said Reginald; \"he said that--he  was a hypocrite, and he went on taunting me about last summer.\"    \"_About last summer!_\" repeated the doctor.    \"Yes, sir--about a mistake. Nobody makes allowances for Louis. I could  have borne it all if he had not said that _I_ knew Louis was a liar. I'd  knock any one down that I was able who should say so! Indeed,\" continued  Reginald, fiercely, \"I begged him to leave off, and not provoke me, but  he would have it, and he knew what I was.\"    \"Enough--enough--hush,\" said Dr. Wilkinson: \"I beg I may hear no more  of knocking down. Don't add to your fault by working yourself into a  passion with me. Some provocation you certainly have had, but nothing  can justify such unrestrained fury. Consider what would have been your  condition at present, if your rage had been fatal to your cousin; it  would have availed you little to have pleaded the aggravation; your  whole life would have been embittered by the indulgence of your vengeful  feelings--one moment have destroyed the enjoyment of years. Thank God,  Mortimer, that you have been spared so terrible a punishment. But you  will always be in danger of this unless you learn to put a curb on your  hasty temper. The same feelings which urge you into a quarrel as a boy,  will hurry you into the duel as a man. It is a false spirit of honor and  manliness that makes you so ready to resent every little insult. In the  life of the only perfect Man that ever lived, our great Example and  Master, we do not see this impatience of contradiction: 'When He was  reviled, He reviled not again;' and if He, the Lord of all, could  condescend to endure such contradiction of sinners against Himself,  shall it be too much for us to bear a little with the contradiction of  our fellow-creatures? My boy, if we do not strive to bear a little  of the burden and heat of the day, we are not worthy to bear the noble  name of Christians.\"    \"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Reginald, quite softened by the earnest  manner of his master; \"I am very sorry I have been so hasty and wrong.  I dare not make any promises for the future, for I know I cannot  certainly keep them, but, with God's help, I hope to remember what  you have so kindly said to me.\"    \"With His help we may do all things,\" said Dr. Wilkinson; \"you may by  this help overcome the stumbling-stone of your violent passions, which  otherwise may become an effectual barrier in the way of your attaining  the prize of eternal life; and remember that 'he that is slow to anger  is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that  taketh a city.'\"    There was a minute's silence, which Reginald broke by asking if he  might attend on Frank until he was well.    \"Can I hope that you will be gentle,\" said the doctor; \"that you will  remember he is in invalid--one of your making, Mortimer; and that if he  is impatient and fretful, you are the cause?\"    \"I will try, sir, to make amends to him,\" said Reginald, looking down;  \"I hope I may be able to be patient.\"    \"I will give orders that you may go to him,\" said the doctor; and after  a pause, he added, \"another offence of this kind I shall visit with the  heaviest displeasure. I am in hopes that the anxiety you have undergone,  and the present state of your cousin, may be a lesson to you; but if  I find this ineffectual, I shall cease to consider you a reasonable  creature, and shall treat you accordingly.\"    Dr. Wilkinson then rose and left the room. Reginald lingered a few  minutes to compose himself before joining his school-fellows; his heart  was very full, and he felt an earnest desire to abide by his master's  counsel, as well as grateful for the leniency and kindness with which  he had been treated, which made him feel his fault much more deeply  than the severest punishment.    The breakfast time was very unpleasant for Louis that morning; he was  full of anxiety as to the result of Mr. Witworth's discovery, and his  sickness of heart entirely deprived him of appetite. When the meal was  dispatched, Reginald went off to Frank, whom he found in a darkened  room, very restless and impatient. He had passed a very bad night, and  was suffering considerable pain. Reginald had to endure much ill-nature  and peevishness; all of which he endeavored to bear with gentleness, and  during the time Frank was ill, he gave up all his play-hours to wait on  him and to amuse him as he grew better; and the exercise of patience  which this office entailed was greatly beneficial to his hasty and  proud spirit.    Mr. Danby was in the midst of the second-class lessons that morning,  when one of the first class brought him a little slip of paper. Mr.  Danby glanced at the few words written thereon, and when the class  had finished he desired Louis to go to Dr. Wilkinson. All remnant of  color fled from Louis' cheek, though he obeyed without making any reply,  and with a very sinking heart entered the room where the doctor was  engaged with the first class. The keen eye of his master detected him  the instant he made his appearance, but he took no notice of him until  he had finished his business; then, while his pupils were putting up  their books he turned to Louis, and pointing to a little table by his  side, said, \"_There_ is a volume, Louis Mortimer, with which I suspect  you have some acquaintance.\"    Louis advanced to the table, and beheld the Key to Kenrick's Greek  Exercises.    \"You know it?\" said the doctor.    \"Yes, sir, but I did not use it,\" said Louis.    \"You will not deny that it was found among your books in the  school-room,\" said the doctor.    \"I know, sir, Mr. Witworth found it, but I assure you I did not  put it there,\" replied Louis, very gently.    \"Have you never used it at all?\" asked Dr. Wilkinson.    \"Never, sir,\" replied Louis, firmly.    At this moment, he met the eye of Hamilton, who was standing near  Dr. Wilkinson, and who looked very scornfully and incredulously at  him as he paused to hear the result of the inquiry. Louis remembered  that Hamilton had seen the key Churchill had left, and he hastily  exclaimed, \"I assure you, Mr. Hamilton, I did not.\"    \"What is this, Hamilton?\" said Dr. Wilkinson, turning round.  \"Do you know any thing of this matter?\"    \"I would much rather not answer,\" said Hamilton, abruptly,  \"if you will excuse me, sir.\"    \"I must, however, beg that you will, if you please,\" replied the doctor.    \"I really know nothing positively, I can say nothing certainly. You  would not wish, sir, that any imagination of mine should prejudice  you to Louis Mortimer's disadvantage; I am not able to say any thing,\"  and Hamilton turned away in some confusion, vexed that he should have  been appealed to.    Dr. Wilkinson looked half perplexed--he paused a moment and fixed his  eyes on the table. Louis ventured to say, \"Mr. Hamilton saw a book once  before with my lesson books, but I never used it.\"    \"What do you mean by _saw a book_?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#8)"],[1,"fatal mission to the Hopituh in the sixteenth  century. This bit of wall, which now forms part of a sheep-fold, is  pointed out as the remains of one of the mission buildings.    Other groups followed--the Mole, the Spider, and the \"Wíksrun.\" These  latter took their name from a curious ornament worn by the men. A piece  of the leg-bone of a bear, from which the marrow had been extracted and  a stopper fixed in one end, was attached to the fillet binding the hair,  and hung down in front of the forehead. This gens and the Mole are now  extinct.    Shumopavi received no further accession of population, but lost to  some extent by a portion of the Bear people moving across to Walpi.  No important event seems to have occurred among them for a long period  after the destruction of Sikyátki, in which they bore some part, and  only cursory mention is made of the ingress of \"enemies from the north;\"  but their village, apparently, was not assailed.    The Oraibi traditions tend to confirm those of Shumopavi, and tell that  the first houses there were built by Bears, who came from the latter  place. The following is from a curious legend of the early settlement:    The Bear people had two chiefs, who were brothers; the elder was called  Vwen-ti-só-mo, and the younger Ma-tcí-to. They had a desperate quarrel  at Shumopavi, and their people divided into two factions, according as  they inclined to one or other of the contestants. After a long period of  contention Ma-tcí-to and his followers withdrew to the mesa where Oraibi  now stands, about 8 miles northwest from Shumopavi, and built houses a  little to the southwest of the limits of the present town. These houses  were afterwards destroyed by \"enemies from the north,\" and the older  portion of the existing town, the southwest ends of the house rows, were  built with stones from the demolished houses. Fragments of these early  walls are still occasionally unearthed.    After Ma-tcí-to and his people were established there, whenever any of  the Shumopavi people became dissatisfied with that place they built at  Oraibi, Ma-tcí-to placed a little stone monument about halfway between  these two villages to mark the boundary of the land. Vwenti-so´-mo  objected to this, but it was ultimately accepted with the proviso that  the village growing the fastest should have the privilege of moving it  toward the other village. The monument still stands, and is on the  direct Oraibi trail from Shumopavi, 3 miles from the latter. It is a  well dressed, rectangular block of sandstone, projecting two feet above  the ground, and measures 8½ by 7 inches. On the end is carved the rude  semblance of a human head, or mask, the eyes and mouth being merely  round shallow holes, with a black line painted around them. The stone is  pecked on the side, but the head and front are rubbed quite smooth, and  the block, tapering slightly to the base, suggests the ancient Roman  Termini.    There are Eagle people living at Oraibi, Mashongnavi, and Walpi, and it  would seem as if they had journeyed for some time with the later Snake  people and others from the northwest. Vague traditions attach them to  several of the ruins north of the Moen-kopi, although most of these are  regarded as the remains of Snake dwellings.    The legend of the Eagle people introduces them from the west, coming in  by way of the Moen-kopi water course. They found many people living in  Tusayan, at Oraibi, the Middle Mesa, and near the East Mesa, but the  Snake village was yet in the valley. Some of the Eagles remained at  Oraibi, but the main body moved to a large mound just east of  Mashongnavi, on the summit of which they built a village and called it  Shi-tái-mu. Numerous traces of small-roomed houses can be seen on this  mound and on some of the lower surroundings. The uneven summit is about  300 by 200 feet, and the village seems to have been built in the form of  an irregular ellipse, but the ground plan is very obscure.      [Illustration: Plate IX. Mishiptonga (Jeditoh).]    While the Eagles were living at Shi-tái-mu, they sent \"Yellow Foot\" to  the mountain in the east (at the headwaters of the Rio Grande) to obtain  a dog. After many perilous adventures in caverns guarded by bear,  mountain lion, and rattlesnake, he got two dogs and returned. They were  wanted to keep the coyotes out of the corn and the gardens. The dogs  grew numerous, and would go to Mashongnavi in search of food, and also  to some of the people of that village, which led to serious quarrels  between them and the Eagle people. Ultimately the Shi-tái-mu chief  proclaimed a feast, and told the people to prepare to leave the village  forever. On the feast day the women arranged the food basins on the  ground in a long line leading out of the village. The people passed  along this line, tasting a mouthful here or there, but without stopping,  and when they reached the last basin they were beyond the limits of the  village. Without turning around they continued on down into the valley  until they were halted by the Snake people. An arrangement was effected  with the latter, and the Eagles built their houses in the Snake village.  A few of the Eagle families who had become attached to Mashongnavi chose  to go to that village, where their descendants still reside, and are yet  held as close relatives by the Eagles of Walpi. The land around the East  Mesa was then portioned out, the Snakes, Horns, Bears, and Eagles each  receiving separate lands, and these old allotments are still  approximately maintained.    According to the Eagle traditions the early occupants of Tusayan came in  the following succession: Snake, Horn, Bear, Middle Mesa, Oraibi, and  Eagle, and finally from the south came the Water families. This sequence  is also recognized in the general tenor of the legends of the other  groups.    Shupaulovi, a small village quite close to Mashongnavi, would seem to  have been established just before the coming of the Water people. Nor  does there seem to have been any very long interval between the arrival  of the earliest occupants of the Middle Mesa and this latest colony.  These were the Sun people, and like the Squash folk, claim to have come  from Palátkwabi, the Red Land, in the south. On their northward  migration, when they came to the valley of the Colorado Chiquito, they  found the Water people there, with whom they lived for some time. This  combined village was built upon Homólobi, a round terraced mound near  Sunset Crossing, where fragmentary ruins covering a wide area can yet be  traced.    Incoming people from the east had built the large village of Awatubi,  high rock, upon a steep mesa about nine miles southeast from Walpi. When  the Sun people came into Tusayan they halted at that village and a few  of them remained there permanently, but the others continued west to the  Middle Mesa. At that time also they say Chukubi, Shitaimu, Mashongnavi,  and the Squash village on the terrace were all occupied, and they built  on the terrace close to the Squash village also. The Sun people were  then very numerous and soon spread their dwellings over the summit where  the ruin now stands, and many indistinct lines of house walls around  this dilapidated village attest its former size. Like the neighboring  village, it takes its name from a rock near by, which is used as a place  for the deposit of votive offerings, but the etymology of the term can  not be traced.    Some of the Bear people also took up their abode at Shupaulovi, and  later a nyumu of the Water family called Batni, moisture, built with  them; and the diminished families of the existing village are still  composed entirely of these three nyumu.    The next arrivals seem to have been the Asanyumu, who in early days  lived in the region of the Chama, in New Mexico, at a village called  Kaékibi, near the place now known as Abiquiu. When they left that region  they moved slowly westward to a place called Túwii (Santo Domingo),  where some of them are said to still reside. The next halt was at  Kaiwáika (Laguna) where it is said some families still remain, and they  staid also a short time at A´ikoka (Acoma); but none of them remained at  that place. From the latter place they went to Sióki (Zuñi), where they  remained a long time and left a number of their people there, who are  now called Aiyáhokwi by the Zuñi. They finally reached Tusayan by way of  Awatubi. They had been preceded from the same part of New Mexico by the  Honan nyumu (the Badger people), whom they found living at the  last-named village. The Magpie, the Pute Kóhu (Boomerang-shaped hunting  stick), and the Field-mouse families of the Asa remained and built  beside the Badger, but the rest of its groups continued across to the  Walpi Mesa. They were not at first permitted to come up to Walpi, which  then occupied its present site, but were allotted a place to build at  Coyote Water, a small spring on the east side of the mesa, just under  the gap. They had not lived there very long, however, when for some  valuable services in defeating at one time a raid of the Ute (who used  to be called the Tcingawúptuh) and of the Navajo at another, they were  given for planting grounds all the space on the mesa summit from the gap  to where Sichumovi now stands, and the same width, extending across the  valley to the east. On the mesa summit they built the early portion of  the house mass on the north side of the village, now known as Hano. But  soon after this came a succession of dry seasons, which caused a great  scarcity of food almost amounting to a famine, and many moved away to  distant streams. The Asa people went to Túpkabi (Deep Canyon, the de  Chelly), about 70 miles northeast from Walpi, where the Navajo received  them kindly and supplied them with food. The Asa had preserved some  seeds of the peach, which they planted in the canyon nooks, and numerous  little orchards still flourish there. They also"]]]
