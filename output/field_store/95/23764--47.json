Now let the bar approach the magnet. When within a short  distance consequent points will be formed and the polarity at the ends  will be reversed, the bar having four poles, as in the second sketch.  The bar of soft iron must have certain dimensions depending on the  size and power of the horseshoe magnet. By using a powerful  electro-magnet in place of a permanent one, a soft iron bar of  considerable size may be used, and the change of polarity exhibited by  showing the repulsion in one case for the south pole and in the other  for the north pole of a heavy permanent magnet. When in the proper  position a very small movement of the soft iron bar is sufficient to  produce the change.    WM. A. ANTHONY.    Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., March 2, 1879.           *       *       *       *       *      GARY'S NEUTRAL LINE.    _To the Editor of the Scientific American:_    I have just read the article in the issue of March 8, on the Gary  Motor, and cannot refrain from offering a suggestion on the subject.  When I read the article referred to in _Harper's_, I formed the same  opinion of the so-called invention that the writer in the SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN has expressed, and, in the main, such is my opinion still. I,  however, tried the experiment by which Gary claims to prove the  existence of his neutral line, and soon found the same explanation  that the writer in the AMERICAN has given. I then, curiously enough,  modified the experiment in precisely the manner he suggests, placing  the magnet in a vertical position, and using first a piece of sheet  iron and then an iron wire under it. This was before seeing the  article in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. My experiment is well illustrated  by the writer's diagram, except that the nail should be at the end of  the iron wire, where its polarity is of course most strongly marked.  But the result is not as he states it. For, as the wire is brought up  toward the magnet, the nail drops off before the wire touches the  magnet. When the sheet iron is used, the point at which the nail drops  off is farther from the magnet than in the case of the wire, and when  it is brought nearer it will again pick up the nail, which then  continues to cling until the iron touches the magnet and afterwards.  Thus the existence of a line in which the soft iron, or induced  magnet, does not attract the nail, and above and below which it does  attract it, is demonstrated. That the polarity of the induced magnet  is reversed when it crosses this line may be demonstrated as follows:  When it is held beyond (or below) this line (Fig. 1), the negative  pole of the permanent magnet, the positive being kept at a distance,  may be made to approach the iron and touch it, without causing the  nail to drop. (Fig. 3.) But when contact occurs, the whole of the iron  must possess the polarity of that part of the magnet which it touches,  namely, negative. Hence in the position indicated in Fig. 1, the  polarity of the induced magnet does not correspond with that of the  permanent magnet, but is as indicated by the letters. On the other  hand, if the positive pole alone be made to approach, the nail will  drop; but when it is very near, or in contact, it again holds the  nail, and the iron is now positive; and if the negative pole also be  now brought into contact, the polarity of the soft iron will  correspond with that of the magnet, as shown in Fig. 2.    [Illustration: Gary's Neutral Line A.]    [Illustration: Gary's Neutral Line B.]    [Illustration: Gary's Neutral Line C.]    These experiments should be performed with the soft iron under both  poles of the magnet, and the ends of the former should extend somewhat  beyond the poles of the latter, or the nail is liable to jump to the  magnet as the \"neutral\" line is crossed. The position of the letters  in Fig. 1, of the previous article, represents the polarity of the  induced magnet to be the same as that of the permanent, which is true  only within (or above) the line described; and this, together with his  statement that no such line can be discovered, appears to indicate  that the writer relied upon his knowledge of the laws of magnetism to  state what would be the result, without testing it experimentally. It  is probable that this reversal of polarity is susceptible of  explanation by the known laws of magnetic currents, but if it has  hitherto escaped observation, its discovery is certainly deserving of  notice, and may lead to valuable results. Of the fact, any one may  easily convince himself by the simple experiments above described.    G. H.

Such is not the case. By an arrangement between Mr.  Wenzel, Mr. Brandon of Paris, and myself, patents have been obtained  in France, England, etc., for the clock, and issued in my name; but  the honor of the invention belongs exclusively to Hermann J.

The thriving town of Decorah lies in a romantic valley of the Upper  Iowa River, and the cave is almost within its corporate limits.  Following the left bank of the stream, one soon reaches the vicinity,  and with a hard scramble through a loose shale, up the side of a  precipitous hill, forming the immediate bank of the river, the  entrance is gained--an opening 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. These  dimensions generally describe the cave's section. From the entrance  the course is a steep decline--seldom less than 40 deg.. At times the  ceiling is so low that progress on hands and knees is necessary. About  125 feet from the entrance the \"Ice Chamber\" is reached. At this spot  the cave widens into a well proportioned room, 8 by 12 feet. The floor  is solid ice of unknown thickness, and on the right hand wall of the  room a curtain of ice drops to the floor, from a crevice extending  horizontally in the rock at the height of one's eyes. Close  examination discovers the water oozing from this crevice, and as it  finds its way down the side it freezes in the low temperature of the  chamber. Singularly this one crevice, and that no wider than a knife  edge, furnishes this, nature's ice house, with the necessary water. It  was a hot day in August, the thermometer marking 80 deg. in the shade  when the visit was made, and comparatively the cold was intense. In  common with all visitors, we detached some large pieces of ice and  with them hurriedly departed, glad to regain the warmth of the outside  world.    The most remarkable fact in connection with this wonder is that the  water only freezes in the summer. As the cold of actual winter comes  on the ice of the cave gradually melts, and when the river below is  frozen by the fierce cold of Northern Iowa, the ice has disappeared  and a muddy slush has taken the place of the frigid floor. I would add  that the ice chamber forms the terminus of the cave. Beyond a shallow  crevice in the crumbling rock forbids further advance. The rock  formation of this region is the Portland sandstone.    Why should the temperature of the ice chamber be such as to freeze the  water trickling into it? And above all, why should the ice disappear  with the cold of winter?    Mansfield, O. H. M. W.           *       *       *       *       *          THE WRITING TELEGRAPH.      On the evening of February 26, 1879, the writing telegraph of Mr. E.  A. Cowper, of London, was exhibited in operation before the Society of  Telegraph Engineers, in that city. It is a curious and remarkable  invention. By its use the handwriting of the operator may be  transmitted, but a double circuit, that is, two telegraph wires, are  used. The operator moves with his hand an upright pointer or stylus,  with which he writes the message on paper. The stylus has two arms  connected with it, one of which arms, when the stylus makes an upward  movement, causes a current to be sent over one wire, while the other  arm causes a current to pass over the other wire when the stylus is  moved laterally. These two motions are, at the receiving end of the  line, made to operate on the needles of galvanometers, and the latter  are by silk threads combined or connected with a delicately suspended  ink tube, from which a minute stream of ink falls upon the strip of  paper below it; the arrangement being such that the combined motions  of the galvanometers so move the ink pen as to make it correspond to  the motion of the stylus at the sending end. The apparatus is said to  work very well, and it is expected that it will form a useful adjunct  to the art of telegraphy. We present herewith a facsimile of writing  done by this new instrument, which has been worked with success over a  line of forty miles length. It is hardly probable that it can compete  in rapidity with some of the telegraph instruments now in use; but for  many purposes it is likely to become important, while in point of  ingenuity it is certainly a great achievement, and the author is  deserving of the highest credit.

The food supply of Russia is inexhaustible. Her industries are working  chiefly for the home market. They can only win by the campaign. The  curtailing of food and raw material exports may benefit her home  industries by cheapening production.    In case of a shortage of war supplies Russia will be able to get them  from neutral countries--for example, from the United States. But where  will Germany get them? What shall she do when her stock of saltpetre  runs out? For the time being saltpetre is obtained by all countries from  Chile only.    France is an agricultural country which has large supplies of food. Her  manufactures are poorly developed, and they are working for a foreign  market which will not be closed. Her resources are so large that she  will be able to stand the campaign with comparative ease.    Owing to her insular position, England will lose but very little through  this war, provided she is able to maintain the supremacy of her navy  over the German fleet. The British merchant marine and her manufactures  will gain quite considerably.    The public credit of France and Great Britain is inexhaustible, and it  will not be restricted to Russia, while she is an ally of these  countries.          Proposed Internal Loans of Russia    [Russkia Vedomosti, No. 222, Sept. 27, (Oct. 3,) 1914, P. 3.]      Prof. Migoulin has submitted to the Russian Minister of Finance a scheme  for new internal loans to meet the extraordinary expenditures caused by  the present war.    It is proposed to enlist the support of various groups of capitalists  and of small property holders and to obtain from them about  2,500,000,000 rubles, ($1,500,000,000.)    Four different loans are contemplated. Persons desiring to invest their  savings at a small but sure interest rate will be able to buy the  certificates at a 5 per cent. loan. These certificates will have a face  value of 100 rubles, and they will sell at $90. The interest rate will  not be changed within the next fifteen or twenty years. Therefore, the  actual interest rate will be 5.56 per cent. on the original investment.    A 6 per cent. loan will cater to those investors who like to place their  loans at shorter terms. The certificates of this loan will be sold at  premiums. Five-year certificates will be sold at ninety-six for a  hundred rubles face value, four-year certificates at ninety-seven,  three-year certificates at ninety-eight, two-year certificates at  ninety-nine, and one-year certificates at par. This loan will be free  from the interest (coupon) tax, but not from the income and inheritance  taxes. In case of success one billion worth of these certificates will  be issued.    For persons interested in the changes of values upon Stock Exchange  different loans will be issued. In the first place, no interest-bearing  ten-ruble certificates with a large number of winners will be issued. A  considerable number of these certificates will be redeemed each year. It  is proposed to have one winner of 200,000 rubles, one of 100,000, two of  50,000, one of 25,000, about fifty of 10,000 rubles each, some 3,950  \"chances\" of from 100 to 500 rubles each. The whole loan may amount to  100,000,000 rubles. It is to be redeemed within fifty years.    Should this loan prove a success it will be followed by another of equal  amount.    Finally, Prof. Migoulin proposes to obtain about 200,000,000 rubles by  selling 4 per cent. Government bonds in fifty-ruble denominations. This  loan, too, will be equipped with the winners at the annual draw for the  redemption.    The first of the proposed loans will be realized soon. The Government  has decided to obtain 500,000,000 rubles at 5 per cent. This new loan  will increase the present debt of the Russian Government of  8,838,000,000 rubles ($4,500,000,000) to 9,338,000,000 rubles. Russia  has to pay 370,000,000 rubles annually for the interest on her debts.  About one-half of her indebtedness is due to railroad building and to  other more or less productive expenditures. But the other half of her  indebtedness has been spent on armaments, wars, and other unproductive  items.    Russia's new budget is about 3,500,000,000 rubles ($1,800,000,000.) The  interest on the new loan will increase this budget only 6 per cent. But  this new loan increases again her unproductive debt and places a heavy  burden upon the taxpayer for whom the Government has prepared many  \"surprises\" this year.    The possibilities of _internal_ loans are not very great. During the  first month of the war about 380,000,000 rubles of savings were  withdrawn from the banks. Of this sum only 76,000,000 were redeposited  later when the first excitement had passed. The rest of the money  evidently was either used up for production, for consumption, or for  private storing of ready cash. How much of this money will come forth to  buy the various short-time loans no one is able to tell beforehand. But  the big manufacturing interests are craving for _foreign gold loans_,  not for internal paper money loans.          How Russian Manufacturers Feel    [Digested from Russkia Vedomosti, No. 266, Nov. 18, (Dec. 1,) 1914, P.  6.]      The manufacturers of war supplies are making large profits through the  war. All they need is Government advances to buy their raw material. The  Government permits them to borrow from the State bank upon Government  orders for war supplies. The only difficulty lies in the extent of the  credit. The Government would not permit borrowing more than one-third of  the amount of its orders, while the manufacturers are asking for  two-fifths.    The manufacturers who are using imported raw material and are working  for the private consumer are suffering heavily from the war. The lack of  coal, of hides, of wool and of cotton is threatening Russian industry  with a crisis. There is a great want of hydroscopic (absorbent) cotton,  since the only factory for this product was in Poland (City of Zgerzc)  and has been destroyed. Lack of dyestuffs and other chemicals is  hampering many other industries. The importation of tea and coffee has  been curtailed considerably.    Russian cotton mills used to get 45 per cent. of their raw material from  the United States, since only 55 per cent. of their demand can be  supplied by Central Asia.    Furthermore, this Asiatic cotton can be used for the coarser grades of  manufacturing only.    The war has cut off the American supply altogether.    Moreover, the manufacturers need cash to buy the cotton available. But  they have none. They have already applied for some hundred million  rubles gold loan from the Treasury, but the Government has promised them  only about eight million from the new loan.    The wool manufacturers are faring no better than the cotton interests.  The only way to get raw wool seems to be to ship it from Australia via  Vladivostok. But the lack of foreign exchange prevents them from using  this source.    The tea trade of Russia will be paralyzed soon for the same reason.    The big manufacturers see only three possibilities of remedying this  situation. The first would be to export gold, the other to export  Russian commodities on a large scale, and the third--to get a gold loan  from Great Britain.    The first proposition is impossible, since the Government will not  permit any exportation of gold at this moment. The second proposition  won't work owing to the demoralized transportation. Thus the only escape  from a serious national crisis seems to lie in a large foreign gold  loan.    This idea is favored by such prominent manufacturers as S.I.  Tschetverikov, G.M. Mark, and A.E. Vladimirov of Moscow, the first  speaking for the wool interests, and other two for the tea wholesalers.  Mr. N.A. Vtovov voices the same sentiments on behalf of the Russian  cotton mill owners.          New Sources of Revenue Needed    By A. Sokolov.    [From Russkia Vedomosti, No. 171, July 26 (Aug. 8), 1914.]      Russia entered upon the present war better equipped financially than  ever before in her history. But it is evident that her ordinary  resources will not suffice, and the Ministry of Finance will have to  find new sources of revenue to meet the gigantic expenditures. The  Ministry of Finance has begun the usual banking and credit  operations--the supervision of specie payments, the issuance of paper  money, and the discounting of the Treasury notes in the State Bank. In  addition to these the Ministry is ready to turn to new taxes.    It proposes to increase the tax on tobacco and to raise the price of  whisky. Both are desirable objects of taxation. The tobacco tax has been  relatively low in Russia. Only the poorer grades of tobacco have been  taxed 100 per cent. ad valorem, while the higher grades have been taxed  at a lower rate.    Any increase of indirect taxation can be justified only by the present  emergency. We should bear in mind that already three-fourths of the  Russian revenue raised by taxation comes through indirect taxes. Further  increase of these taxes will inflict new heavy burdens upon the poorer  classes, who in any case will have to bear the heaviest burden of the  war.    The present historical moment is of such magnitude that it can be  compared only with the Napoleonic wars. But at that time also the higher  classes had to contribute to the war expenditures. In 1810 an income tax  was put upon the landed nobility. Wishing to make it appear that the war  tax is a voluntary contribution, the Government levied it according to  the declarations of the taxpayers and refused to listen to informers as  to tax-dodging. The tax rate was progressive, with a maximum of 10 per  cent. All incomes below 500 rubles ($250)[1] were exempt.    It is to be hoped that the great memory of the year 1812 will induce the  well-to-do classes to contribute their share to the expenditures"]]]
