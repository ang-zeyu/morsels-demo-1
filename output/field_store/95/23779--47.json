We are men, and not mere animals, because a  special form of it is with us always; we are nobler and baser men, as it  is with us more or less; but it is never given to us in any degree which  can make us more than men.      45. Observe:--I give you this general statement doubtfully, and only as  that towards which an impartial reasoner will, I think, be inclined by  existing data. But I shall be able to show you, without any doubt, in  the course of our studies, that the achievements of art which have been  usually looked upon as the results of peculiar inspiration have been  arrived at only through long courses of wisely directed labour, and  under the influence of feelings which are common to all humanity.    But of these feelings and powers which in different degrees are common  to humanity, you are to note that there are three principal divisions:  first, the instincts of construction or melody, which we share with  lower animals, and which are in us as native as the instinct of the bee  or nightingale; secondly, the faculty of vision, or of dreaming, whether  in sleep or in conscious trance, or by voluntarily exerted fancy; and  lastly, the power of rational inference and collection, of both the laws  and forms of beauty.      46. Now the faculty of vision, being closely associated with the  innermost spiritual nature, is the one which has by most reasoners been  held for the peculiar channel of Divine teaching: and it is a fact that  great part of purely didactic art has been the record, whether in  language, or by linear representation, of actual vision involuntarily  received at the moment, though cast on a mental retina blanched  by the past course of faithful life. But it is also true that  these visions, where most distinctly received, are always--I speak  deliberately--_always_, the _sign of some mental limitation or  derangement_; and that the persons who most clearly recognise their  value, exaggeratedly estimate it, choosing what they find to be useful,  and calling that \"inspired,\" and disregarding what they perceive to be  useless, though presented to the visionary by an equal authority.      47. Thus it is probable that no work of art has been more widely  didactic than Albert Duerer's engraving, known as the \"Knight and  Death.\"[6] But that is only one of a series of works representing  similarly vivid dreams, of which some are uninteresting, except for the  manner of their representation, as the \"St. Hubert,\" and others are  unintelligible; some, frightful, and wholly unprofitable; so that we  find the visionary faculty in that great painter, when accurately  examined, to be a morbid influence, abasing his skill more frequently  than encouraging it, and sacrificing the greater part of his energies  upon vain subjects, two only being produced, in the course of a long  life, which are of high didactic value, and both of these capable only  of giving sad courage.[7] Whatever the value of these two, it bears more  the aspect of a treasure obtained at great cost of suffering, than of a  directly granted gift from heaven.    [Footnote 6: Standard Series, No. 9.]    [Footnote 7: The meaning of the \"Knight and Death,\" even in this  respect, has lately been questioned on good grounds.]      48. On the contrary, not only the highest, but the most consistent  results have been attained in art by men in whom the faculty of vision,  however strong, was subordinate to that of deliberative design, and  tranquillised by a measured, continual, not feverish, but affectionate,  observance of the quite unvisionary facts of the surrounding world.    And so far as we can trace the connection of their powers with the moral  character of their lives, we shall find that the best art is the work of  good, but of not distinctively religious men, who, at least, are  conscious of no inspiration, and often so unconscious of their  superiority to others, that one of the greatest of them, Reynolds,  deceived by his modesty, has asserted that \"all things are possible to  well-directed labour.\"      49. The second question, namely, how far art, if not inspired, has yet  been ennobled by religion, I shall not touch upon to-day; for it both  requires technical criticism, and would divert you too long from the  main question of all,--How far religion has been helped by art?    You will find that the operation of formative art--(I will not speak  to-day of music)--the operation of formative art on religious creed is  essentially twofold; the realisation, to the eyes, of imagined spiritual  persons; and the limitation of their imagined presence to certain  places. We will examine these two functions of it successively.      50. And first, consider accurately what the agency of art is, in  realising, to the sight, our conceptions of spiritual persons.    For instance. Assume that we believe that the Madonna is always present  to hear and answer our prayers. Assume also that this is true. I think  that persons in a perfectly honest, faithful, and humble temper, would  in that case desire only to feel so much of the Divine presence as the  spiritual Power herself chose to make felt; and, above all things, not  to think they saw, or knew, anything except what might be truly  perceived or known.    But a mind imperfectly faithful, and impatient in its distress, or  craving in its dulness for a more distinct and convincing sense of the  Divinity, would endeavour to complete, or perhaps we should rather say  to contract, its conception, into the definite figure of a woman wearing  a blue or crimson dress, and having fair features, dark eyes, and  gracefully arranged hair.    Suppose, after forming such a conception, that we have the power to  realise and preserve it, this image of a beautiful figure with a  pleasant expression cannot but have the tendency of afterwards leading  us to think of the Virgin as present, when she is not actually present;  or as pleased with us, when she is not actually pleased; or if we  resolutely prevent ourselves from such imagination, nevertheless the  existence of the image beside us will often turn our thoughts towards  subjects of religion, when otherwise they would have been differently  occupied; and, in the midst of other occupations, will familiarise more  or less, and even mechanically associate with common or faultful states  of mind, the appearance of the supposed Divine person.      51. There are thus two distinct operations upon our mind: first, the art  makes us believe what we would not otherwise have believed; and  secondly, it makes us think of subjects we should not otherwise have  thought of, intruding them amidst our ordinary thoughts in a confusing  and familiar manner. We cannot with any certainty affirm the advantage  or the harm of such accidental pieties, for their effect will be very  different on different characters: but, without any question, the art,  which makes us believe what we would not have otherwise believed, is  misapplied, and in most instances very dangerously so. Our duty is to  believe in the existence of Divine, or any other, persons, only upon  rational proofs of their existence; and not because we have seen  pictures of them.[8]    [Footnote 8: I have expunged a sentence insisting farther on this point,  having come to reverence more, as I grew older, every simple means of  stimulating all religious belief and affection. It is the lower and  realistic world which is fullest of false beliefs and vain loves.]      52. But now observe, it is here necessary to draw a distinction, so  subtle that in dealing with facts it is continually impossible to mark  it with precision, yet so vital, that not only your understanding of the  power of art, but the working of your minds in matters of primal moment  to you, depends on the effort you make to affirm this distinction  strongly. The art which realises a creature of the imagination is only  mischievous when that realisation is conceived to imply, or does  practically induce a belief in, the real existence of the imagined  personage, contrary to, or unjustified by the other evidence of its  existence. But if the art only represents the personage on the  understanding that its form is imaginary, then the effort at realisation  is healthful and beneficial.    For instance, the Greek design of Apollo crossing the sea to Delphi,  which is one of the most interesting of Le Normant's series, so far as  it is only an expression, under the symbol of a human form, of what may  be rightly imagined respecting the solar power, is right and ennobling;  but so far as it conveyed to the Greek the idea of there being a real  Apollo, it was mischievous, whether there be, or be not, a real Apollo.  If there is no real Apollo, then the art was mischievous because it  deceived; but if there is a real Apollo, then it was still more  mischievous,[9] for it not only began the degradation of the image of  that true god into a decoration for niches, and a device for seals; but  prevented any true witness being borne to his existence. For if the  Greeks, instead of multiplying representations of what they imagined to  be the figure of the god, had given us accurate drawings of the heroes  and battles of Marathon and Salamis, and had simply told us in plain  Greek what evidence they had of the power of Apollo, either through his  oracles, his help or chastisement, or by immediate vision, they would  have served their religion more truly than by all the vase-paintings and  fine statues that ever were buried or adored.      53. Now in this particular instance, and in many other examples of fine  Greek art, the two conditions of thought, symbolic and realistic, are  mingled; and the art is helpful, as I will hereafter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#8)"],[1,"on the rocks for some distance and climb to the ridge whose  farther slope led down to Granite Creek. He did not follow the trail,  but struck straight across an outcropping ledge, descended to Granite  Creek and strode along next the hill where the soil was gravelly and  barren. When he had gone some distance, he sat down and took from under  his coat two huge, crudely made moccasins of coyote skin. These he  pulled on over his shoes, tied them around his ankles and went on, still  keeping close under the hill.    He reached the place where Fred Thurman lay, stood well away from the  body and studied every detail closely. Then, stepping carefully on  trampled brush and rocks, he approached and cautiously lifted Lone's  coat. It was not a pretty sight, but Swan's interest held him there for  perhaps ten minutes, his eyes leaving the body only when the blaze-faced  horse moved. Then Swan would look up quickly at the horse, seem  reassured when he saw that the animal was not watching anything at a  distance, and return to his curious task. Finally he drew the coat back  over the head and shoulders, placed each stone exactly as he had found  it and went up to the horse, examining the saddle rather closely. After  that he retreated as carefully as he had approached. When he had gone  half a mile or so upstream he found a place where he could wash his  hands without wetting his moccasins, returned to the rocky hillside and  took off the clumsy footgear and stowed them away under his coat. Then  with long strides that covered the ground as fast as a horse could do  without loping, Swan headed as straight as might be for the Thurman  ranch.    About noon Swan approached the crowd of men and a few women who stood  at a little distance and whispered together, with their faces averted  from the body around which the men stood grouped. The news had spread as  such news will, even in a country so sparsely settled as the Sawtooth.  Swan counted forty men,--he did not bother with the women. Fred Thurman  had been known to every one of them. Some one had spread a piece of  canvas over the corpse, and Swan did not go very near. The blaze-faced  horse had been led farther away and tied to a cottonwood, where some one  had thrown down a bundle of hay. The Sawtooth country was rather  punctilious in its duty toward the law, and it was generally believed  that the coroner would want to see the horse that had caused the  tragedy.    Half an hour after Swan arrived, the coroner came in a machine, and with  him came the sheriff. The coroner, an important little man, examined the  body, the horse and the saddle, and there was the usual formula of  swearing in a jury. The inquest was rather short, since there was only  one witness to testify, and Lone merely told how he had discovered the  horse there by the creek, and that the body had not been moved from  where he found it.    Swan went over to where Lone, anxious to get away from the place, was  untying his horse after the jury had officially named the death an  accident.    \"I guess those horses could be turned loose,\" he began without prelude.  \"What you think, Lone? I been to Thurman's ranch, and I don't find  anybody. Some horses in a corral, and pigs in a pen, and chickens. I  guess Thurman was living alone. Should I tell the coroner that?\"    \"I dunno,\" Lone replied shortly. \"You might speak to the sheriff. I  reckon he's the man to take charge of things.\"    \"It's bad business, getting killed,\" Swan said vaguely. \"It makes me  feel damn sorry when I go to that ranch. There's the horses waiting for  breakfast--and Thurman, he's dead over here and can't feed his pigs and  his chickens. It's a white cat over there that comes to meet me and rubs  my leg and purrs like it's lonesome. That's a nice ranch he's got, too.  Now what becomes of that ranch? What you think, Lone?\"    \"Hell, how should I know?\" Lone scowled at him from the saddle and rode  away, leaving Swan standing there staring after him. He turned away to  find the sheriff and almost collided with Brit Hunter, who was glancing  speculatively from him to Lone Morgan. Swan stopped and put out his hand  to shake.    \"Lone says I should tell the sheriff I could look after Fred Thurman's  ranch. What you think, Mr. Hunter?\"    \"Good idea, I guess. Somebody'll have to. They can't----\" He checked  himself. \"You got a horse? I'll ride over with yuh, maybe.\"    \"I got legs,\" Swan returned laconically. \"They don't get scared, Mr.  Hunter, and maybe kill me sometime. You could tell the sheriff I'm  government hunter and honest man, and I take good care of things. You  could do that, please?\"    \"Sure,\" said Brit and rode over to where the sheriff was standing.    The sheriff listened, nodded, beckoned to Swan. \"The court'll have to  settle up the estate and find his heirs, if he's got any. But you look  after things--what's your name? Vjolmar--how yuh spell it? I'll swear  you in as a deputy. Good Lord, you're a husky son-of-a-gun!\" The  sheriff's eyes went up to Swan's hat crown, descended to his shoulders  and lingered there admiringly for a moment, traveled down his flat,  hard-muscled body and his straight legs. \"I'll bet you could put up  some fight, if you had to,\" he commented.    Swan grinned good-humoredly, glanced conscience-stricken at the covered  figure on the ground and straightened his face decorously.    \"I could lick you good,\" he admitted in a stage whisper. \"I'm a  son-off-a-gun all right--only I don't never get mad at somebody.\"    Brit Hunter smiled at that, it was so like Swan Vjolmar. But when they  were halfway to Thurman's ranch--Brit on horseback and Swan striding  easily along beside him, leading the blaze-faced horse, he glanced down  at Swan's face and wondered if Swan had not lied a little.    \"What's on your mind, Swan?\" he asked abruptly.    Swan started and looked up at him, glanced at the empty hills on either  side, and stopped still in the trail.    \"Mr. Hunter, you been longer in the country than I have been. You seen  some good riding, I bet. Maybe you see some men ride backwards on a  horse?\"    Brit looked at him uncomprehendingly. \"Backwards?\"    Swan led up the blaze-faced horse and pointed to the right stirrup.  \"Spurs would scratch like that if you jerk your foot, maybe. You're a  good rider, Mr. Hunter, you can tell. That's a right stirrup, ain't it?  Fred Thurman, he's got his left foot twist around, all broke from  jerking in his stirrup. Left foot in right stirrup----\" He pushed back  his hat and rumpled his yellow hair, looking up into Brit's face  inquiringly. \"Left foot in right stirrup is riding backwards. That's a  damn good rider to ride like that--what you think, Mr. Hunter?\"          CHAPTER SIX    LONE ADVISES SILENCE      Twice in the next week Lone found an excuse for riding over to the  Sawtooth. During his first visit, the foreman's wife told him that the  young lady was still too sick to talk much. The second time he went, Pop  Bridgers spied him first and cackled over his coming to see the girl.  Lone grinned and dissembled as best he could, knowing that Pop Bridgers  fed his imagination upon denials and argument and remonstrance and was  likely to build gossip that might spread beyond the Sawtooth. Wherefore  he did not go near the foreman's house that day, but contented himself  with gathering from Pop's talk that the girl was still there.    After that he rode here and there, wherever he would be likely to meet a  Sawtooth rider, and so at last he came upon Al Woodruff loping along the  crest of Juniper Ridge. Al at first displayed no intention of stopping,  but pulled up when he saw John Doe slowing down significantly. Lone  would have preferred a chat with some one else, for this was a  sharp-eyed, sharp-tongued man; but Al Woodruff stayed at the ranch and  would know all the news, and even though he might give it an ill-natured  twist, Lone would at least know what was going on. Al hailed him with a  laughing epithet.    \"Say, you sure enough played hell all around, bringin' Brit Hunter's  girl to the Sawtooth!\" he began, chuckling as if he had some secret  joke. \"Where'd you pick her up, Lone? She claims you found her at Rock  City. That right?\"    \"No, it ain't right,\" Lone denied promptly, his dark eyes meeting Al's  glance steadily. \"I found her in that gulch away this side. She was in  amongst the rocks where she was trying to keep outa the rain. Brit  Hunter's girl, is she? She told me she was going to the Sawtooth. She'd  have made it, too, if it hadn't been for the storm. She got as far as  the gulch, and the lightning scared her from going any farther.\" He  offered Al his tobacco sack and fumbled for a match. \"I never knew Brit  Hunter had a girl.\"    \"Nor me,\" Al said and sifted tobacco into a cigarette paper. \"Bob, he  drove her over there yesterday. Took him close to all day to make the  trip--and Bob, he claims to hate women!\"    \"So would I, if I'd got stung for fifty thousand. She ain't that kind.  She's a nice girl, far as I could tell. She got well, all right, did  she?\"    \"Yeah--only she was still coughing some when she left the ranch. She  like to of had pneumonia, I guess. Queer how she claimed she spent the  night in Rock City, ain't it?\"    \"No,\" Lone answered judicially, \"I don't know as it's so queer. She  never realized how far she'd walked, I reckon. She was plumb crazy when  I found her. You couldn't take any stock in what she said. Say, you  didn't see that bay I was halter-breaking, did yuh, Al? He jumped the  fence and got away on me, day before yesterday. I'd like to catch him up  again. He'll make a good horse.\"    Al had not seen the bay, and the talk tapered off desultorily to a final  \"So-long, see yuh later.\" Lone rode on, careful not to look back. So she  was Brit Hunter's girl! Lone whistled softly to himself while he studied  this new angle of the problem,--for a problem he was beginning to  consider it. She was Brit"]]]
