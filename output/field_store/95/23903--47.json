CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTION.--TWO CLASSES OF EMIGRANTS--TWO GOVERNMENTS FOR SEVENTY  YEARS--THE \"PILGRIM FATHERS\"--THEIR PILGRIMAGES AND SETTLEMENT.      In proceeding to trace the development and characteristics of Puritanism  in an English colony, I beg to remark that I write, not as an  Englishman, but as a Canadian colonist by birth and life-long residence,  and as an early and constant advocate of those equal rights, civil and  religious, and that system of government in the enjoyment of which  Canada is conspicuous.    In tracing the origin and development of those views and feelings which  culminated in the American Revolution, in the separation of thirteen  colonies from Great Britain, it is necessary to notice the early  settlement and progress of those New England colonies in which the seeds  of that revolution were first sown and grew to maturity.    The colonies of New England resulted from two distinct emigrations of  English Puritans; two classes of Puritans; two distinct governments for  more than sixty years. The one class of these emigrants were called  \"Pilgrim Fathers,\" having first fled from England to Holland, and thence  emigrated to New England in 1620, in the _Mayflower_, and called their  place of settlement \"New Plymouth,\" where they elected seven Governors  in succession, and existed under a self-constituted government for  seventy years. The other class were called \"Puritan Fathers;\" the first  instalment of their emigration took place in 1629, under Endicot; they  were known as the Massachusetts Bay Company, and their final capital was  Boston, which afterwards became the capital of the Province and of the  State.    The characteristics of the separate and independent government of these  two classes of Puritans were widely different. The one was tolerant and  non-persecuting, and loyal to the King during the whole period of its  seventy years' existence; the other was an intolerant persecutor of all  religionists who did not adopt its worship, and disloyal from the  beginning to the Government from which it held its Charter.    It is essential to my purpose to compare and contrast the proceedings of  these two governments in relation to religious liberty and loyalty. I  will first give a short account of the origin and government of the  \"_Pilgrim_ Fathers\" of New Plymouth, and then the government of the  \"_Puritan_ Fathers\" of Massachusetts Bay.[1]    In the later years of Queen Elizabeth, a \"fiery young clergyman,\" named  Robert Brown, declared against the lawfulness of both Episcopal and  Presbyterian Church government, or of fellowship with either  Episcopalians or Presbyterians, and in favour of the absolute  independence of each congregation, and the ordination as well as  selection of the minister by it. This was the origin of the Independents  in England. The zeal of Brown, like that of most violent zealots, soon  cooled, and he returned and obtained a living again in the Church of  England, which he possessed until his death; but his principles of  separation and independence survived. The first congregation was formed  about the year 1602, near the confines of York, Nottingham, and  Leicester, and chose for its pastor John Robinson. They gathered for  worship secretly, and were compelled to change their places of meeting  in order to elude the pursuit of spies and soldiers. After enduring many  cruel sufferings, Robinson, with the greater part of his congregation,  determined to escape persecution by becoming _pilgrims_ in a foreign  land.

S.    _Courtier._ Fool! I will tell you who Charudatta is.        A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow,      Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low;      Father to good men; virtue's touchstone he;      The mirror of the learned; and the sea      Where all the tides of character unite;      A righteous man, whom pride could never blight;      A treasure-house, with human virtues stored;      Courtesy's essence, honor's precious hoard.      He doth to life its fullest meaning give,      So good is he; we others breathe, not live.                  48    Let us be gone.    _Sansthanaka._ Without Vasantasena?    _Courtier._ Vasantasena has disappeared.    _Sansthanaka._ How?    _Courtier._        Like sick men's strength, or like the blind man's sight,      Like the fool's judgment, like the sluggard's might,      Like thoughtless scoundrels' store of wisdom's light,      Like love, when foemen fan our slumbering wrath,      So did _she_ vanish, when you crossed her path.              49    _Sansthanaka._ I'm not going without Vasantasena.    _Courtier._ And did you never hear this?        To hold a horse, you need a rein;      To hold an elephant, a chain;      To hold a woman, use a heart;      And if you haven't one, depart.                              50    _Sansthanaka._ If you're going, go along. I'm not going.    _Courtier._ Very well. I will go.              [_Exit._    P. 38.2]    _Sansthanaka._ Mashter's gone, sure enough. [_To Maitreya._] Well,  you man with the head that looks like a caret, you manikin, take a  sheat, take a sheat.    _Maitreya._ We have already been invited to take a seat.    _Sansthanaka._ By whom?    _Maitreya._ By destiny.    _Sansthanaka._ Shtand up, then, shtand up!    _Maitreya._ We shall.    _Sansthanaka._ When?    _Maitreya._ When fate is kind again.    _Sansthanaka._ Weep, then, weep!    _Maitreya._ We have wept.    _Sansthanaka._ Who made you?    _Maitreya._ Poverty.    _Sansthanaka._ Laugh, then, laugh!    _Maitreya._ Laugh we shall.    _Sansthanaka._ When?    _Maitreya._ When Charudatta is happy once more.    _Sansthanaka._ You manikin, give poor little Charudatta thish messhage  from me. \"Thish wench with golden ornaments and golden jewels, thish  female shtage-manager looking after the rehearsal of a new play, thish  Vasantasena--she has been in love with you ever shince she went into the  park where Kama's temple shtands. And when we tried to conciliate her by  force, she went into your houshe. Now if you shend her away yourshelf  and hand her over to me, if you reshtore her at once, without any  lawshuit in court, then I'll be friends with you forever. But if you  don't reshtore her, there will be a fight to the death.\" Remember:        Shmear a pumpkin-shtalk with cow-dung;        Keep your vegetables dried;      Cook your rice in winter evenings;        And be sure your meat is fried.

Tell it to him sho that  I can hear it as I roosht in the dove-cote on the top of my own  palace. If you shay it different, I'll chew your head like an apple  caught in the crack of a door.    _Maitreya._ Very well. I shall tell him.    _Sansthanaka._ [_Aside._] Tell me, shervant. Is mashter really gone?    _Servant._ Yes, sir.    _Sansthanaka._ Then we will go as quickly as we can.    _Servant._ Then take your sword, master.    _Sansthanaka._ You can keep it.    _Servant._ Here it is, master. Take your sword, master.    _Sansthanaka._ [_Taking it by the wrong end._]        My shword, red as a radish shkin,        Ne'er finds the time to molder;      Shee how it shleeps its sheath within!

I am sure you would only add to the poor man's  sorrows.    _Radanika._ Good Maitreya, you know Radanika. Her lips are sealed.    _Maitreya._ So be it.           *       *       *       *       *    _Charudatta._ [_To Vasantasena._] Radanika, Rohasena likes the fresh  air, but he will be cold in the evening chill. Pray bring him into the  house, and cover him with this mantle. [_He gives her the mantle._]    P. 49.19]    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] See! He thinks I am his servant. [_She  takes the mantle and perceives its perfume. Ardently to herself._] Oh,  beautiful! The mantle is fragrant with jasmine. His youthful days  are not wholly indifferent to the pleasures of the world. [_She wraps  it about her, without letting Charudatta see._]    _Charudatta._ Come, Radanika, take Rohasena and enter the heart  of the house.    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Ah me unhappy, that have little part  or lot in your heart!    _Charudatta._ Come, Radanika, will you not even answer? Alas!        When man once sees that miserable day,      When fate almighty sweeps his wealth away,      Then ancient friendships will no longer hold,      Then all his former bosom-friends grow cold.                 53    _Maitreya._ [_Drawing near to Radanika._] Sir, here is Radanika.    _Charudatta._ Here is Radanika? Who then is this--        This unknown lady, by my robe        Thus clinging, desecrated,    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Say rather \"consecrated.\"    _Charudatta._ Until she seems the crescent moon.        With clouds of autumn[38] mated?                           54    But no! I may not gaze upon another's wife.    _Maitreya._ Oh, you need not fear that you are looking at another  man's wife. This is Vasantasena, who has been in love with you  ever since she saw you in the garden where Kama's temple stands.    _Charudatta._ What! this is Vasantasena? [_Aside._]        My love for whom--my fortune spent--      My wretched self in twain has rent.      Like coward's anger, inward bent.                            55    [23. 19. S.    _Maitreya._ My friend, that brother-in-law of the king says--    _Charudatta._ Well?    _Maitreya._ \"This wench with golden ornaments and golden jewels,  this female stage-manager looking after the rehearsal of a new  play, this Vasantasena--she has been in love with you ever since  she went into the park where Kama's temple stands. And when we  tried to conciliate her by force, she went into your house.\"    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] \"Tried to conciliate me by force\"--truly,  I am honored by these words.    _Maitreya._ \"Now if you send her away yourself and hand her over  to me, if you restore her at once, without any lawsuit in court,  then I'll be friends with you forever. Otherwise, there will be a  fight to the death.\"    _Charudatta._ [_Contemptuously._] He is a fool. [_To himself._] How is  this maiden worthy of the worship that we pay a goddess! For now        Although I bade her enter, yet she seeks        To spare my poverty, nor enters here;      Though men are known to her, yet all she speaks        Contains no word to wound a modest ear.                    56    [_Aloud._] Mistress Vasantasena, I have unwittingly made myself  guilty of an offense; for I greeted as a servant one whom I did not  recognize. I bend my neck to ask your pardon.    _Vasantasena._ It is I who have offended by this unseemly intrusion.  I bow my head to seek your forgiveness.    _Maitreya._ Yes, with your pretty bows you two have knocked your  heads together, till they look like a couple of rice-fields. I also bow  my head like a camel colt's knee and beseech you both to stand  up. [_He does so, then rises._]    _Charudatta._ Very well, let us no longer trouble ourselves with  conventions.    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] What a delightfully clever hint! But  it would hardly be proper to spend the night, considering how I  came hither. Well, I will at least say this much. [_Aloud._] If I am  to receive thus much of your favor, sir, I should be glad to leave  these jewels in your house. It was for the sake of the jewels that  those scoundrels pursued me.    P. 45.14]    _Charudatta._ This house is not worthy of the trust.    _Vasantasena._ You mistake, sir! It is to men that treasures are  entrusted, not to houses.    _Charudatta._ Maitreya, will you receive the jewels?    _Vasantasena._ I am much indebted to you. [_She hands him the  jewels._]    _Maitreya._ [_Receiving them._] Heaven bless you, madam.    _Charudatta._ Fool! They are only entrusted to us.    _Maitreya._ [_Aside._] Then the thieves may take them, for all I care.    _Charudatta._ In a very short time--    _Maitreya._ What she has entrusted to us, belongs to us.    _Charudatta._ I shall restore them.    _Vasantasena._ I should be grateful, sir, if this gentleman would  accompany me home.    _Charudatta._ Maitreya, pray accompany our guest.    _Maitreya._ She walks as gracefully as a female swan, and you are  the gay flamingo to accompany her. But I am only a poor Brahman,  and wherever I go, the people will fall upon me just as dogs will  snap at a victim dragged to the cross-roads.    _Charudatta._ Very well. I will accompany her myself. Let the  torches be lighted, to ensure our safety on the highway.    _Maitreya._ Vardhamanaka, light the torches.    _Vardhamanaka._ [_Aside to Maitreya._] What! light torches without  oil?    _Maitreya._ [_Aside to Charudatta._] These torches of ours are like  courtezans who despise their poor lovers. They won't light up unless  you feed them.    [25.23. S.    _Charudatta._ Enough, Maitreya! We need no torches. See, we have  a lamp upon the king's highway.        Attended by her starry servants all,        And pale to see as a loving maiden's cheeks,      Rises before our eyes the moon's bright ball,      Whose pure beams on the high-piled darkness fall        Like streaming milk that"]]]
