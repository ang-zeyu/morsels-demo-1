Should Thy bounty be withheld from anyone,  how could he be reckoned among the followers of the Faith in Thy Day?    Bless me, O my God, and those who will believe in Thy signs on the  appointed Day, and such as cherish my love in their hearts--a love which  Thou dost instill into them. Verily, Thou art the Lord of righteousness,  the Most Exalted.    --The Bab        \"I beg Thy forgiveness, O my God, and implore...\"      I beg Thy forgiveness, O my God, and implore pardon after the manner Thou  wishest Thy servants to direct themselves to Thee. I beg of Thee to wash  away our sins as befitteth Thy Lordship, and to forgive me, my parents,  and those who in Thy estimation have entered the abode of Thy love in a  manner which is worthy of Thy transcendent sovereignty and well beseemeth  the glory of Thy celestial power.    O my God! Thou hast inspired my soul to offer its supplication to Thee,  and but for Thee, I would not call upon Thee. Lauded and glorified art  Thou; I yield Thee praise inasmuch as Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me,  and I beg Thee to forgive me, since I have fallen short in my duty to know  Thee and have failed to walk in the path of Thy love.    --The Bab        \"O Lord! In this Most Great Dispensation Thou...\"      O Lord! In this Most Great Dispensation Thou dost accept the intercession  of children in behalf of their parents. This is one of the special  infinite bestowals of this Dispensation. Therefore, O Thou kind Lord,  accept the request of this Thy servant at the threshold of Thy singleness  and submerge his father in the ocean of Thy grace, because this son hath  arisen to render Thee service and is exerting effort at all times in the  pathway of Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Forgiver and the  Kind!    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, my God! This Thy handmaid is calling...\"      O God, my God! This Thy handmaid is calling upon Thee, trusting in Thee,  turning her face unto Thee, imploring Thee to shed Thy heavenly bounties  upon her, and to disclose unto her Thy spiritual mysteries, and to cast  upon her the lights of Thy Godhead.    O my Lord! Make the eyes of my husband to see. Rejoice Thou his heart with  the light of the knowledge of Thee, draw Thou his mind unto Thy luminous  beauty, cheer Thou his spirit by revealing unto him Thy manifest  splendors.    O my Lord! Lift Thou the veil from before his sight. Rain down Thy  plenteous bounties upon him, intoxicate him with the wine of love for  Thee, make him one of Thy angels whose feet walk upon this earth even as  their souls are soaring through the high heavens. Cause him to become a  brilliant lamp, shining out with the light of Thy wisdom in the midst of  Thy people.    Verily, Thou art the Precious, the Ever-Bestowing, the Open of Hand.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"My Lord! My Lord! I praise Thee and I thank...\"      My Lord! My Lord! I praise Thee and I thank Thee for that whereby Thou  hast favored Thine humble maidservant, Thy slave beseeching and  supplicating Thee, because Thou hast verily guided her unto Thine obvious  Kingdom and caused her to hear Thine exalted Call in the contingent world  and to behold Thy Signs which prove the appearance of Thy victorious reign  over all things.    O my Lord, I dedicate that which is in my womb unto Thee. Then cause it to  be a praiseworthy child in Thy Kingdom and a fortunate one by Thy favor  and Thy generosity; to develop and to grow up under the charge of Thine  education. Verily, Thou art the Gracious! Verily, Thou art the Lord of  Great Favor!    --'Abdu'l-Baha          FIRMNESS IN THE COVENANT        \"Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity, and the...\"      Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity, and the Maker of nations, and the  Fashioner of every moldering bone! I pray Thee, by Thy Name through which  Thou didst call all mankind unto the horizon of Thy majesty and glory, and  didst guide Thy servants to the court of Thy grace and favors, to number  me with such as have rid themselves from everything except Thyself, and  have set themselves towards Thee, and have not been kept back by such  misfortunes as were decreed by Thee, from turning in the direction of Thy  gifts.    I have laid hold, O my Lord, on the handle of Thy bounty, and clung  steadfastly to the hem of the robe of Thy favor. Send down, then, upon me,  out of the clouds of Thy generosity, what will purge out from me the  remembrance of anyone except Thee, and make me able to turn unto Him Who  is the Object of the adoration of all mankind, against Whom have been  arrayed the stirrers of sedition, who have broken Thy covenant, and  disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs.    Deny me not, O my Lord, the fragrances of Thy raiment in Thy days, and  deprive me not of the breathings of Thy Revelation at the appearance of  the splendors of the light of Thy face. Powerful art Thou to do what  pleaseth Thee. Naught can resist Thy will, nor frustrate what Thou hast  purposed by Thy power.    No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"He is the Mighty, the Pardoner, the Compassionate!...\"      He is the Mighty, the Pardoner, the Compassionate!    O God, my God! Thou beholdest Thy servants in the abyss of perdition and  error; where is Thy light of divine guidance, O Thou the Desire of the  world? Thou knowest their helplessness and their feebleness; where is Thy  power, O Thou in Whose grasp lie the powers of heaven and earth?    I ask Thee, O Lord my God, by the splendor of the lights of Thy  loving-kindness and the billows of the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom  and by Thy Word wherewith Thou hast swayed the peoples of Thy dominion, to  grant that I may be one of them that have observed Thy bidding in Thy  Book. And do Thou ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy  trusted ones, them that have quaffed the wine of divine inspiration from  the chalice of Thy bounty and hastened to do Thy pleasure and observe Thy  Covenant and Testament. Powerful art Thou to do as Thou willest. There is  none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    Decree for me, by Thy bounty, O Lord, that which shall prosper me in this  world and hereafter and shall draw me nigh unto Thee, O Thou Who art the  Lord of all men. There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Mighty,  the Glorified.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Make firm our steps, O Lord, in Thy path...\"      Make firm our steps, O Lord, in Thy path and strengthen Thou our hearts in  Thine obedience. Turn our faces toward the beauty of Thy oneness, and  gladden our bosoms with the signs of Thy divine unity. Adorn our bodies  with the robe of Thy bounty, and remove from our eyes the veil of  sinfulness, and give us the chalice of Thy grace; that the essence of all  beings may sing Thy praise before the vision of Thy grandeur. Reveal then  Thyself, O Lord, by Thy merciful utterance and the mystery of Thy divine  being, that the holy ecstasy of prayer may fill our souls--a prayer that  shall rise above words and letters and transcend the murmur of syllables  and sounds--that all things may be merged into nothingness before the  revelation of Thy splendor.    Lord! These are servants that have remained fast and firm in Thy Covenant  and Thy Testament, that have held fast unto the cord of constancy in Thy  Cause and clung unto the hem of the robe of Thy grandeur. Assist them, O  Lord, with Thy grace, confirm with Thy power and strengthen their loins in  obedience to Thee.    Thou art the Pardoner, the Gracious.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O compassionate God! Thanks be to Thee for...\"      O compassionate God! Thanks be to Thee for Thou hast awakened and made me  conscious. Thou hast given me a seeing eye and favored me with a hearing  ear, hast led me to Thy kingdom and guided me to Thy path. Thou hast shown  me the right way and caused me to enter the ark of deliverance. O God!  Keep me steadfast and make me firm and staunch. Protect me from violent  tests, and preserve and shelter me in the strongly fortified fortress of  Thy Covenant and Testament. Thou art the Powerful. Thou art the Seeing.  Thou art the Hearing.    O Thou the Compassionate God. Bestow upon me a heart which, like unto  glass, may be illumined with the light of Thy love, and confer upon me  thoughts which may change this world into a rose garden through the  outpourings of heavenly grace.    Thou art the Compassionate, the Merciful. Thou art the Great Beneficent  God.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my Lord and my Hope! Help Thou Thy...\"      O my Lord and my Hope! Help Thou Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy  mighty Covenant, to remain faithful to Thy manifest Cause, and to carry  out the commandments Thou didst set down for them in Thy Book of  Splendors; that they may become banners of guidance and lamps of the  Company above, wellsprings of Thine infinite wisdom, and stars that lead  aright, as they shine down from the supernal sky.    Verily, art Thou the Invincible, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          FORGIVENESS        \"Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Chosen Ones, and  by the Bearers of Thy Trust, and by Him Whom Thou hast ordained to be the  Seal of Thy Prophets and of Thy Messengers, to let Thy remembrance be my  companion, and Thy love my aim, and Thy face my goal, and Thy name my  lamp, and Thy wish my desire, and Thy pleasure my delight.    I am a sinner, O my Lord, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving. As soon as I  recognized Thee, I hastened to attain the exalted court of Thy  loving-kindness. Forgive me, O my Lord, my sins which have hindered me  from walking in the ways of Thy good pleasure, and from attaining the  shores of the ocean of Thy oneness.    There is no one, O my Lord, who can deal bountifully with me to whom I can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#8)"],[1,"of pure gold will pass straight through it aloof as a  cloud, and will neither turn back, nor pause. Such a man is assuredly of  Me. From his garment the Concourse on high can inhale the fragrance of  sanctity.... And if he met the fairest and most comely of women, he would  not feel his heart seduced by the least shadow of desire for her beauty.  Such an one indeed is the creation of spotless chastity. Thus instructeth  you the Pen of the Ancient of Days, as bidden by your Lord, the Almighty,  the All-Bountiful.\" \"They that follow their lusts and corrupt  inclinations,\" is yet another warning, \"have erred and dissipated their  efforts. They indeed are of the lost.\" \"It behooveth the people of Baha,\"  He also has written, \"to die to the world and all that is therein, to be  so detached from all earthly things that the inmates of Paradise may  inhale from their garment the sweet smelling savor of sanctity.... They  that have tarnished the fair name of the Cause of God by following the  things of the flesh--these are in palpable error!\" \"Purity and chastity,\"  He particularly admonishes, \"have been, and still are, the most great  ornaments for the handmaidens of God. God is My Witness! The brightness of  the light of chastity sheddeth its illumination upon the worlds of the  spirit, and its fragrance is wafted even unto the Most Exalted Paradise.\"  \"God,\" He again affirms, \"hath verily made chastity to be a crown for the  heads of His handmaidens. Great is the blessedness of that handmaiden that  hath attained unto this great station.\" \"We, verily, have decreed in Our  Book,\" is His assurance, \"a goodly and bountiful reward to whosoever will  turn away from wickedness, and lead a chaste and godly life. He, in truth,  is the Great Giver, the All-Bountiful.\" \"We have sustained the weight of  all calamities,\" He testifies, \"to sanctify you from all earthly  corruption and ye are yet indifferent.... We, verily, behold your actions.  If We perceive from them the sweet smelling savor of purity and holiness,  We will most certainly bless you. Then will the tongues of the inmates of  Paradise utter your praise and magnify your names amidst them who have  drawn nigh unto God.\"    \"The drinking of wine,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"is, according to the text of  the Most Holy Book, forbidden; for it is the cause of chronic diseases,  weakeneth the nerves, and consumeth the mind.\" \"Drink ye, O handmaidens of  God,\" Baha'u'llah Himself has affirmed, \"the Mystic Wine from the cup of  My words. Cast away, then, from you that which your minds abhor, for it  hath been forbidden unto you in His Tablets and His Scriptures. Beware  lest ye barter away the River that is life indeed for that which the souls  of the pure-hearted detest. Become ye intoxicated with the wine of the  love of God, and not with that which deadeneth your minds, O ye that adore  Him! Verily, it hath been forbidden unto every believer, whether man or  woman. Thus hath the sun of My commandment shone forth above the horizon  of My utterance, that the handmaidens who believe in Me may be illumined.\"    It must be remembered, however, that the maintenance of such a high  standard of moral conduct is not to be associated or confused with any  form of asceticism, or of excessive and bigoted puritanism. The standard  inculcated by Baha'u'llah seeks, under no circumstances, to deny anyone  the legitimate right and privilege to derive the fullest advantage and  benefit from the manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures with which the  world has been so plentifully enriched by an All-Loving Creator. \"Should a  man,\" Baha'u'llah Himself reassures us, \"wish to adorn himself with the  ornaments of the earth, to wear its apparels, or partake of the benefits  it can bestow, no harm can befall him, if he alloweth nothing whatever to  intervene between him and God, for God hath ordained every good thing,  whether created in the heavens or in the earth, for such of His servants  as truly believe in Him. Eat ye, O people, of the good things which God  hath allowed you, and deprive not yourselves from His wondrous bounties.  Render thanks and praise unto Him, and be of them that are truly  thankful.\"    As to racial prejudice, the corrosion of which, for well-nigh a century,  has bitten into the fiber, and attacked the whole social structure of  American society, it should be regarded as constituting the most vital and  challenging issue confronting the Baha'i community at the present stage of  its evolution. The ceaseless exertions which this issue of paramount  importance calls for, the sacrifices it must impose, the care and  vigilance it demands, the moral courage and fortitude it requires, the  tact and sympathy it necessitates, invest this problem, which the American  believers are still far from having satisfactorily resolved, with an  urgency and importance that cannot be overestimated. White and Negro, high  and low, young and old, whether newly converted to the Faith or not, all  who stand identified with it must participate in, and lend their  assistance, each according to his or her capacity, experience, and  opportunities, to the common task of fulfilling the instructions,  realizing the hopes, and following the example, of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Whether  colored or noncolored, neither race has the right, or can conscientiously  claim, to be regarded as absolved from such an obligation, as having  realized such hopes, or having faithfully followed such an example. A long  and thorny road, beset with pitfalls, still remains untraveled, both by  the white and the Negro exponents of the redeeming Faith of Baha'u'llah.  On the distance they cover, and the manner in which they travel that road,  must depend, to an extent which few among them can imagine, the operation  of those intangible influences which are indispensable to the spiritual  triumph of the American believers and the material success of their newly  launched enterprise.    Let them call to mind, fearlessly and determinedly, the example and  conduct of 'Abdu'l-Baha while in their midst. Let them remember His  courage, His genuine love, His informal and indiscriminating fellowship,  His contempt for and impatience of criticism, tempered by His tact and  wisdom. Let them revive and perpetuate the memory of those unforgettable  and historic episodes and occasions on which He so strikingly demonstrated  His keen sense of justice, His spontaneous sympathy for the downtrodden,  His ever-abiding sense of the oneness of the human race, His overflowing  love for its members, and His displeasure with those who dared to flout  His wishes, to deride His methods, to challenge His principles, or to  nullify His acts.    To discriminate against any race, on the ground of its being socially  backward, politically immature, and numerically in a minority, is a  flagrant violation of the spirit that animates the Faith of Baha'u'llah.  The consciousness of any division or cleavage in its ranks is alien to its  very purpose, principles, and ideals. Once its members have fully  recognized the claim of its Author, and, by identifying themselves with  its Administrative Order, accepted unreservedly the principles and laws  embodied in its teachings, every differentiation of class, creed, or color  must automatically be obliterated, and never be allowed, under any  pretext, and however great the pressure of events or of public opinion, to  reassert itself. If any discrimination is at all to be tolerated, it  should be a discrimination not against, but rather in favor of the  minority, be it racial or otherwise. Unlike the nations and peoples of the  earth, be they of the East or of the West, democratic or authoritarian,  communist or capitalist, whether belonging to the Old World or the New,  who either ignore, trample upon, or extirpate, the racial, religious, or  political minorities within the sphere of their jurisdiction, every  organized community enlisted under the banner of Baha'u'llah should feel  it to be its first and inescapable obligation to nurture, encourage, and  safeguard every minority belonging to any faith, race, class, or nation  within it. So great and vital is this principle that in such  circumstances, as when an equal number of ballots have been cast in an  election, or where the qualifications for any office are balanced as  between the various races, faiths or nationalities within the community,  priority should unhesitatingly be accorded the party representing the  minority, and this for no other reason except to stimulate and encourage  it, and afford it an opportunity to further the interests of the  community. In the light of this principle, and bearing in mind the extreme  desirability of having the minority elements participate and share  responsibility in the conduct of Baha'i activity, it should be the duty of  every Baha'i community so to arrange its affairs that in cases where  individuals belonging to the divers minority elements within it are  already qualified and fulfill the necessary requirements, Baha'i  representative institutions, be they Assemblies, conventions, conferences,  or committees, may have represented on them as many of these divers  elements, racial or otherwise, as possible. The adoption of such a course,  and faithful adherence to it, would not only be a source of inspiration  and encouragement to those elements that are numerically small and  inadequately represented, but would demonstrate to the world at large the  universality and representative character of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and  the freedom of His followers from the taint of those prejudices which have  already wrought such havoc in the domestic affairs, as well as the foreign  relationships, of the nations.    Freedom from racial prejudice, in any of its forms, should, at such a time  as this when an increasingly large section of the human race is falling a  victim to its devastating ferocity, be adopted as the watchword"]]]
