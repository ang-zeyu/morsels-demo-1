Objects are to us in reality only aggregates of  sensations.    2. The sensations belong to the different organs of the senses--sight,  hearing, touch, the muscular sense, &c. Whatever be the sense  affected, one sensation has the same rights as the others, from the  point of view of the cognition of external objects. It is impossible  to distinguish them into subjective and objective, by giving to this  distinction the meaning that certain sensations represent objects as  they are, while certain others simply represent our manner of feeling.  This is an illegitimate distinction, since all sensations have the  same physiological condition, the excitement of a sensory nerve, and  result from the properties of this nerve when stimulated.    3. Consequently, it is impossible for us to form a conception of  matter in terms of movement, and to explain by the modalities of  movement the properties of bodies; for this theory amounts to giving  to certain sensations, especially those of the muscular sense, the  hegemony over the others. We cannot explain, we have not the right to  explain, one sensation by another, and the mechanical theory of matter  has simply the value of a symbol.

Hamilton's  Philosophy_, chap. x. p. 176, _et. seq._]    [Footnote 12: See p. 18, _sup._--ED.]          BOOK II    THE DEFINITION OF MIND          CHAPTER I    THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN COGNITION[13] AND ITS OBJECT      After having thus studied matter and reduced it to sensations, we  shall apply the same method of analysis to mind, and inquire whether  mind possesses any characteristic which allows it to be distinguished  from matter.    Before going any further, let me clear up an ambiguity. All the first  part of this work has been devoted to the study of what is known to us  in and by sensation; and I have taken upon myself, without advancing  any kind of justifying reason, to call that which is known to us, by  this method, by the name of matter, thus losing sight of the fact that  matter only exists by contra-distinction and opposition to mind, and  that if mind did not exist, neither would matter. I have thus appeared  to prejudge the question to be resolved.    The whole of this terminology must now be considered as having simply  a conventional value, and must be set aside for the present. These  are the precise terms in which this question presents itself to my  mind. A part of the knowable consists in sensations. We must,  therefore, without troubling to style this aggregate of sensations  _matter_ rather than _mind_, make an analysis of the phenomena known  by the name of mind, and see whether they differ from the preceding  ones. Let us, therefore, make an inventory of mind. By the process of  enumeration, we find quoted as psychological phenomena, the  sensations, the perceptions, the ideas, the recollections, the  reasonings, the emotions, the desires, the imaginations, and the acts  of attention and of will. These appear to be, at the first glance, the  elements of mind; but, on reflection, one perceives that these  elements belong to two distinct categories, of which it is easy to  recognise the duality, although, in fact and in reality, these two  elements are constantly combined. The first of these elements may  receive the generic name of objects of cognition, or objects known,  and the second that of acts of cognition.    Here are a few examples of concrete facts, which only require a rapid  analysis to make their double nature plain. In a sensation which we  feel are two things: a particular state, or an object which one knows,  and the act of knowing it, of feeling it, of taking cognisance of it;  in other words, every sensation comprises an impression and a  cognition. In a recollection there is, in like manner, a certain image  of the past and the fact consisting in the taking cognisance of this  image. It is, in other terms, the distinction between the intelligence  and the object. Similarly, all reasoning has an object; there must be  matter on which to reason, whether this matter be supplied by the  facts or the ideas. Again, a desire, a volition, an act of reflection,  has need of a point of application. One does not will in the air, one  wills something; one does not reflect in the void, one reflects over a  fact or over some difficulty.    We may then provisionally distinguish in an inventory of the mind a  something which is perceived, understood, desired, or willed, and,  beyond that, the fact of perceiving, of understanding, or desiring, or  of willing.    To illustrate this distinction by an example, I shall say that an  analogous separation can be effected in an act of vision, by showing  that the act of vision, which is a concrete operation, comprises two  distinct elements: the object seen and the eye which sees. But this  is, of course, only a rough comparison, of which we shall soon see the  imperfections when we are further advanced in the study of the  question.    To this activity which exists and manifests itself in the facts of  feeling, perceiving, &c., we can give a name in order to identify and  recognise it: we will call it the consciousness[14] (_la conscience_),  and we will call object everything which is not the act of  consciousness.    After this preliminary distinction, to which we shall often refer, we  will go over the principal manifestations of the mind, and we will  first study the objects of cognition, reserving for another chapter  the study of the acts of cognition--that is to say, of consciousness.  We will thus examine successively sensation, idea, emotion, and will.    It has been often maintained that the peculiar property of mind is to  perceive sensations. It has also been said that thought--that is, the  property of representing to one's self that which does not  exist--distinguishes mind from matter. Lastly, it has not failed to be  affirmed that one thing which the mind brings into the material world  is its power of emotion; and moralists, choosing somewhat arbitrarily  among certain emotions, have said that the mind is the creator of  goodness. We will endeavour to analyse these different affirmations.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 13: See [Note 3], _sup._ on p. 15.--ED.]    [Footnote 14: The word \"_conscience_\" is one of those which has been  used in the greatest number of different meanings. Let it be, at  least, understood that _I_ use it here in an intellectual and not a  moral sense. I do not attach to the conscience the idea of a moral  approbation or disapprobation, of a duty, of a remorse. The best  example to illustrate conscience has, perhaps, been formed by LADD. It  is the contrast between a person awake and sleeping a dreamless sleep.  The first has consciousness of a number of things; the latter has  consciousness of nothing. Let me now add that we distinguish from  consciousness that multitude of things of which one has consciousness  of. Of these we make the object of consciousness. [_Conscience_ has  throughout been rendered \"consciousness.\"--ED.]]          CHAPTER II    DEFINITION OF SENSATION      When making the analysis of matter we impliedly admitted two  propositions: first, that sensation is the _tertium quid_ which is  interposed between the excitant of our sensory nerves and ourselves;  secondly, that the aggregate of our sensations is all we can know of  the outer world, so that it is correct to define this last as the  collection of our present, past, and possible sensations. It is not  claimed that the outer world is nothing else than this, but it is  claimed with good reason that the outer world is nothing else _to us_.    It would be possible to draw from the above considerations a clear  definition of sensation, and especially it would be possible to decide  henceforth from the foregoing whether sensation is a physical or a  mental phenomenon, and whether it belongs to matter or to mind. This  is the important point, the one which we now state, and which we will  endeavour to resolve. To make the question clearer, we will begin it  afresh, as if it were new, and as if the facts hitherto analysed did  not already prejudge the solution. Let us begin by giving a definition  of sensation from the point of view of experimental psychology.    Sensation, then, is the phenomenon which is produced and which one  experiences when an excitant has just acted on one of our organs of  sense. This phenomenon is therefore composed of two parts: an action  exercised from outside by some body or other on our nervous substance;  and, then, the fact of feeling this action.    This fact of feeling, this state of consciousness, is necessary to  constitute sensation; when it does not exist, it is preferable to give  the phenomenon another name, otherwise the fault is committed of  mixing up separate facts. Physiologists have, on this point, some  faults of terminology with which to reproach themselves: for they have  employed the word sensibility with too little of the critical spirit.  Sensibility, being capacity for sensation, presupposes, like sensation  itself, consciousness. It has, therefore, been wrong, in physiology,  to speak of the sensibility of the tissues and organs, which, like the  vegetable tissues or the animal organs of vegetative life, properly  speaking, feel nothing, but react by rapid or slow movements to the  excitements they are made to receive. Reaction, by a movement or any  kind of modification, to an excitement, does not constitute a  sensation unless consciousness is joined with it, and, consequently,  it would be wiser to give unfelt excitements and reactions the name of  excitability.    The clearest examples of sensation are furnished by the study of man,  and are taken from cases where we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],[0,"The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#8)"],[1,"asked her. \"Are you hungry?\"    But Miss Kitty Cat soon showed that she wasn't hungry, for she wouldn't  touch anything that Mrs. Green offered her.    \"Well, you'll have to run away, anyhow,\" Mrs. Green told her. \"I can't  take a step with you right under my feet.\"    Though Miss Kitty Cat trotted towards the door, she soon made it plain  that she didn't intend to leave the kitchen unless her mistress went  with her. She came back and twitched Mrs. Green's apron gently with her  claws. Then she ran to the doorway again and called to Mrs. Green.    It seemed to Miss Kitty Cat that she couldn't have said more clearly  that she wanted to lead Mrs. Green somewhere. But still Mrs. Green  didn't quite understand.    \"Scat!\" she cried, just a bit impatiently. \"I've too much to do to be  bothered this morning. I suppose you've caught a mouse and want to show  it to me. You'll have to bring it here, for I haven't any time to waste  to-day.\"    Miss Kitty Cat felt somewhat hurt. She went out and sat on the doorstep  and looked in at Farmer Green's wife. Now and then she gave a plaintive  mew. But Mrs. Green wouldn't pay any attention to her.    \"Dear me!\" said Miss Kitty. \"Mrs. Green is busier than ever this  morning.\"    Old dog Spot had been watching Miss Kitty's actions. And now, as she  started towards the barn, he sidled up to her, wagging his tail to show  her that he wanted to have a few friendly words with her.    \"If Mrs. Green won't come with you, I'll be glad to,\" he offered. \"Just  lead the way and I'll follow.\"    \"You?\" Miss Kitty Cat exclaimed with scorn. \"You needn't think I'd take  you where I want Mrs. Green to come. You needn't think I'd show you what  I want her to see.\"    \"Ho!\" cried old Spot. \"I don't know how you're going to stop me from  following you.\"    \"I do,\" said Miss Kitty firmly. \"If you try to tag along after me where  I'm going I'll soon make you wish you had minded your own affairs.\"    There was a look in her eyes that old Spot did not like. It reminded him  of the time when he cornered Miss Kitty in the barn, soon after she  arrived at the farm. He remembered that his nose still bore the marks of  her sharp claws.    \"Well, well!\" he said. \"I was only joking. I'm too busy to bother with  you, anyhow. I have a little matter to attend to in the pasture. There's  a Woodchuck up there that's getting too bold.\"    Then he trotted off, trying to look as important as possible, so that no  one would think he was afraid of Miss Kitty Cat.    \"Good!\" Miss Kitty cried, as she watched him while he started up the  lane.    \"I'm glad he's out of the way. It would be awkward if I had to fight him  while I'm doing what I'm going to do.\"          XXIV    FIVE IN A BASKET      \"WELL, if you're not bothering me again!\" Farmer Green's wife exclaimed.    Miss Kitty Cat had come up behind her and brushed against her, asking at  the same time with her most polite mew if Mrs. Green wouldn't please  turn around.    Mrs. Green looked over her shoulder.    \"I declare!\" she cried. \"So that's what you've been fussing about, is  it?\"    Miss Kitty Cat gently laid something on the floor at her mistress' feet.  And she acted much pleased when Mrs. Green bent over and picked up a  tiny, soft, pudgy--kitten.    \"What do you think of that?\" Miss Kitty Cat asked Mrs. Green. At least,  that was what Mrs. Green understood her to say.    Anyhow, Miss Kitty appeared delighted with what Mrs. Green told her. And  feeling that her youngster was in safe hands, Miss Kitty Cat ran out of  the kitchen and disappeared.    In a little while she returned, carrying another kitten in her mouth.  Mrs. Green admired this one as much as the first. And again Miss Kitty  vanished.    She returned with a third kitten; she returned with a fourth one.    \"Well, well!\" Farmer Green's wife said to her. \"We have enough  now--don't you think so?\"    Mrs. Green soon learned that Miss Kitty Cat was not quite of the same  mind. She made one more trip across the yard to the barn. And at last,  with an air of great pride she set down a fifth kitten upon the kitchen  floor.    \"That's all, Mrs. Green,\" Miss Kitty said. \"They're so beautiful it's a  shame there aren't twice as many.\"    But Mrs. Green was out in the woodshed and didn't hear her. She came in  soon with a basket.    \"This is what old Spot used to sleep in when he was a puppy,\" Mrs. Green  told Miss Kitty Cat. \"I suppose you're willing to use it for your  family.\"    Miss Kitty made no objection when Mrs. Green carefully laid the five  kittens side by side on an old shawl which she spread in the bottom of  the basket. Then Mrs. Green picked up the precious burden and with Miss  Kitty following closely, set it down in a corner of the woodshed.    \"There!\" said Mrs. Green. \"Now they're snug and warm. And I'll set  your milk right beside the basket, so you won't have to leave your  family when you drink it.\"    [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Guards Her Kittens.]    It was not long before old dog Spot poked his long nose though the  woodshed doorway and spied Miss Kitty Cat close beside the basket,  lapping her milk. He gave a short bark when he saw her. And to his  astonishment both Miss Kitty Cat and Farmer Green's wife came running at  him.    Mrs. Green had a broom in her hand and Miss Kitty Cat had her claws in  her paws. They both ordered him to keep away from the woodshed. And Spot  sneaked off to the barn and hid in the stall beside the old horse  Ebenezer.    \"What's troubling you?\" Ebenezer inquired in his slow way.    \"It's that ill-natured Miss Kitty Cat,\" Spot exclaimed. \"She has a big  family of kittens. And she's terribly touchy about anybody's coming near  them. Although she's keeping them in my basket, she hasn't even invited  me to have a look at them.... I only hope,\" he added, \"they won't grow  up to be like their mother.\"    Old Ebenezer looked down at him with mild surprise.    \"What's the matter with Miss Kitty?\" he asked.    \"She can't take a joke,\" said Spot. \"If you chase her, she always claws  you if she can.\"    Now, that was one of the first things Miss Kitty taught her children.  She claimed that claws were made to be used--especially on old dog  Spot.    But when a kitten tried its claws on one of its mates Miss Kitty always  cuffed it smartly. She claimed, then, that claws were _not_ made to be  used--especially on one's own family.    And in time the kittens learned their lessons perfectly.
