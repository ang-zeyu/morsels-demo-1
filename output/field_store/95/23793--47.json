The utmost simplicity and flexibility  should be observed, and a selection from the Baha'i Sacred Writing should  serve the purpose at the present time, provided this selection is not  rigidly and uniformly adopted on all such occasions.\"    \"There is no objection whatsoever to non-Baha'is being present when the  long prayer for the dead is read, as long as they respect our manner of  reading it by rising and standing as the Baha'is do on this occasion. Nor,  indeed, is there any objection to non-Baha'is being present during the  reading of any Baha'i prayer for the departed.    \"An official Baha'i funeral service should only be given for a believer,  but there is no objection to the reading of Baha'i prayers, or indeed, to  a Baha'i conducting the funeral service of a non-Baha'i if this has been  requested.\"            86: GREATEST NAME (TRANSLATION OF SYMBOL OF)      \"He also wishes me to inform you that the symbol of the Greatest Name  represents an invocation which can be translated either as 'O Glory of  Glories' or 'O Glory of the All-Glorious'. The word Glory used in this  connection is a translation of the Arabic term 'Baha, the name of  Baha'u'llah.\"            87: GROUP, BAHA'I      \"...next to an isolated believer, any number of confirmed Baha'is less  than nine persons should be considered as automatically constituting a  Baha'i Group...\"            88: GUARDIAN (INFALLIBILITY OF THE)      \"The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are  related strictly to the Cause and interpretation of the teachings; he is  not an infallible authority on other subjects, such as economics, science,  etc. When he feels that a certain thing is essential for the protection of  the Cause, even if it is something that affects a person personally, he  must be obeyed, but when he gives advice, such as that he gave you in a  previous letter about your future, it is not binding; you are free to  follow it or not as you please.\"            89: GUIDANCE, DIVINE (OF GUARDIAN)      \"He feels that if ... ponders more deeply about the fundamentals of Divine  Revelation, she will also come to understand the Guardianship. Once the  mind and heart have grasped the fact that God guides men through a  Mouthpiece, a human being, a Prophet, infallible and unerring, it is only  a logical projection of this acceptance to also accept the station of  'Abdu'l-Baha and the Guardians. The Guardians are the evidence of the  maturity of mankind in the sense that at long last men have progressed to  the point of having one world, and of needing one world management for  human affairs. In the spiritual realm they have also reached the point  where God could leave, in human hands (i.e. the Guardians) guided directly  by the Bab and Baha'u'llah, as the Master states in His Will, the affairs  of His Faith for this Dispensation. This is what is meant by 'this is the  day which will not be followed by night.' In this Dispensation, divine  guidance flows on to us in this world after the Prophet's ascension,  through first the Master, and then the Guardians. If a person can accept  Baha'u'llah's function, it should not present any difficulty to them to  also accept what He has ordained in a Divinely guided individual in  matters pertaining to the Faith.\"            90: GUIDANCE (INDIVIDUAL)      \"The questions you ask in your letter about individual guidance have two  aspects, one might say. It is good that people should turn to God and  beseech His aid in solving their problems and guiding their acts, indeed  every day of their lives, if they feel the desire to do so. But they  cannot possibly impose what they feel to be their guidance on anyone else,  let alone on Assemblies or Committees, as Baha'u'llah has expressly laid  down the law of consultation and never indicated that anything else  superseded it.\"    \"As to meditation: This also is a field in which the individual is free.  There are no set forms of meditation prescribed in the teachings, no plan  as such, for inner development. The friends are urged--nay enjoined--to  pray, and they also should meditate, but the manner of doing the latter is  left entirely to the individual.\"            91: GUIDANCE (QUESTION OF)      \"The question of Guidance is a very subtle one. We cannot be positive that  an impulse or a dream is guidance. We can seek, through earnest prayer and  longing, sincerely to do God's will, His guidance. We can try, as you say,  to emulate the Master and at all times live up to the teachings, but we  cannot be sure that doing these things we are still making no mistakes and  are perfectly guided. These things help us not to make so many mistakes  and to receive more directly the guidance God seeks to give us.\"            92: HANDS OF THE CAUSE--INSTITUTIONS (STATION AND FUNCTION--WHEN MENTIONED  IN WRITING)      \"The rank and position of the Hands of the Cause are superior to the  position of the National Assemblies. In writing concerning the Hands,  therefore, when there is reference to the Institutions of the Faith, after  the Guardian should be mentioned the Hands, and then the National  Bodies...\"            93: HAZIRATU'L-QUDS (FUNCTIONS OF)      \"While the National Office in Wilmette, designated by the Guardian as  Haziratu'l-Quds, is primarily an administrative center, its use should by  no means be confined to purely administrative work, but should include  such activities of a social and intellectual character, both local and  national, as can best establish its character as the foremost teaching and  administrative center of the Faith throughout the States.\"    \"As a teaching center, where Baha'i lectures, conferences, meetings,  whether local, regional or national, could be held, the Haziratu'l-Quds  can also prove of invaluable help, and the N.S.A. should indeed see to it  that the necessary facilities are provided in the building for that  purpose. But thus combining these three features, namely teaching,  administrative, and social the Haziratu'l-Quds can best fulfill its  mission, as the visible symbol of the steadily-growing National Baha'i  Community in Northern America, and as the chief rallying center for all  its activities and plans throughout that Continent.\"            94: HEALING      \"The Guardian knows nothing about your kind of healing... But he can lay  down for your guidance certain broad principles: There is no such thing as  Baha'i healers or a Baha'i type of healing. In His Most Holy Book (the  Aqdas) Baha'u'llah says to consult the best physicians, in other words,  doctors who have studied a scientific system of medicine; He never gave us  to believe, He Himself would heal us through 'Healers' but rather through  prayer and the assistance of medicine and approved treatments. Now, as  long as your healing is in no opposition to these principles, as long as  you do not try and take the place of a regular doctor in trying to heal  others, but only give them your kind of help through constructive  suggestion--or whatever it may be--and do not associate this help with  being a channel of the direct grace of Baha'u'llah, the Guardian sees no  harm in your continuing your assistance to others. But you must  conscientiously decide whether, in view of the above, you are really  justified in continuing. He will pray for your guidance and happiness.\"            95: HEROISM IS NEEDED      \"These, indeed, are the days when heroism is needed on the part of the  believers. Self-sacrifice, courage, indomitable hope and confidence are  characteristics they should show forth, because these very attributes  cannot but fix the attention of the public and lead them to enquire what,  in a world so hopelessly chaotic and bewildered, leads these people to be  so assured, so confident, so full of devotion? Increasingly, as time goes  by, the characteristics of the Baha'is will be that which captures the  attention of their fellow-citizens. They must show their aloofness from  the hatreds and recriminations which are tearing at the hearts of  humanity, and demonstrate by deed and word their profound belief in the  future peaceful unification of the entire human race.\"            96: HIDDEN WORDS (ARABIC)      \"As to the passage No. 13 of the Arabic Hidden Words: That which  Baha'u'llah declares we can find abiding within us is the power of the  Divine Spirit, the reflection of the light of His Revelation. This  reflection of the Divine Spirit, however, can in no way be compared to the  Revelation which God discloses to His Prophets and Messengers. The  similarity in the terminology should not confuse this distinction which is  most fundamental.\"            97: HOLY DAYS--BAHA'I      \"He wishes the Baha'is to press for recognition of their right to observe  their own Holy Days, and to observe them whenever possible in strict  accordance with our teachings.\"    \"He wishes also to stress the fact that, according to the Baha'i laws,  work is forbidden on our nine Holy Days. Believers who have independent  businesses or shops should refrain from working on these days. Those who  are in government employ should, on religious grounds, make an effort to  be excused from work; all believers, whoever their employers, should do  likewise. If the government or other employers refuse to grant them these  days off, they are not required to forfeit their employment, but they  should make every effort to have the independent status of the Faith  recognized and their right to hold their own religious Holy Days  acknowledged.\"            98: HOLY DAYS OF OTHER RELIGIONS      \"As regards the celebration of the Christian Holiday by the believers; it  is surely preferable and even highly advisable that the friends should in  their relation to each other discontinue observing such holidays as  Christmas and New Years, and to have their festival gatherings of this  nature instead during the Intercalary Days and Naw-Ruz....\"            99: HOLY SHRINE (BELIEV"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#8)"],[1,"for the teachings of the Cause along that line. We  should always take such opportunities that present themselves. May be we  would succeed to render some service to society and alleviate its ills.    November 10, 1930    Shoghi Effendi hopes that with the combined efforts of the friends and the  Master's infinite mercy a great success will be achieved at both of the  conferences. While visiting the Blessed Shrines he will remember the  delegates and ask for them divine guidance. If presented properly the  position of women in the Baha'i teachings will surely attract much  attention, for it is not only legal but also spiritual and educational.  Our ideals are so high and at the same time so practicable that all other  views will fall short if compared to them.    Shoghi Effendi hopes that many will be able to attend these conferences  and render all the assistance they possibly can.    [From the Guardian:]    I trust that the message sent on behalf of the Greatest Holy Leaf and  myself has reached in time and been conveyed to the members of the  conference. May the Almighty Hand of Baha'u'llah guide your steps and  sustain your efforts in the manifold services you are rendering to the  Cause. I will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.    January 7, 1931          Publication of the \"Dawn-Breakers\"      The Guardian has also received the account of the National Fund of the  National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India & Burma and he read it  with careful attention and deep interest.    He was very pleased to learn with what self-sacrificing efforts our Indian  brothers are toiling and he fervently prays that the Almighty may  continually shower His blessings upon them that they may be able to spread  the Cause in the most rapid and in the most efficient way.    Shoghi Effendi was particularly rejoiced at the perseverance with which  our talented Baha'i brother, Dr. Pritam Singh, is carrying on his work in  connection with the publication of the \"Baha'i Weekly\", copies of which he  has received and read with deepest interest.    You may have heard of the projected publication by the Baha'i Publishing  Committee of the book entitled \"The Dawn-Breakers\" being Nabil's narrative  of the early days of the Baha'i revelation, recently translated by the  Guardian. It is hoped that the Indian friends will order a few copies of  this highly valuable book and that they will send a few others to some of  the leading libraries in India and Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    My prayers will continue to be offered on behalf of the loyal and  self-sacrificing friends in India and Burma. Prof. Pritam Singh's notable  and ever-increasing share in the administrative, literary and financial  activities of the Faith in that land is a source of genuine and constant  satisfaction. I would specially request your Assembly to prepare a  comprehensive and detailed report on the activities and progress of the  Faith in India and Burma during the last two years, 1930-32, for inclusion  in the forthcoming issue of the Baha'i World. Will you kindly forward the  report to Mr. Horace Holley as soon as possible, as he has been charged to  draw up a survey similar to the one published in the last volume. I would  also urge the friends in India and Burma to order as many copies of the  \"Dawn-Breakers\" as they possibly can as I regard its circulation of vital  importance to the Cause.    August 29, 1931          Advertisements in Baha'i Periodicals      Shoghi Effendi wishes me to drop you these few lines to draw your  attention to a general principle he has laid down for all the Baha'i  periodicals, namely that they should be very careful in selecting the  advertisements they accept to publish. It should be highly dignified, such  as books for example, otherwise it would detract from the dignity of the  periodical itself. This may cause certain difficulty in financially  establishing the paper, but we should face the sacrifice and not endanger  the prestige of our publications. He wishes you to take note of this  general recommendation in accepting advertisements for the Baha'i Weekly.    January 7, 1932          Mrs. Ransom Kehler Visits India      Mrs. Ransom Kehler has informed us of her trip to India. Shoghi Effendi  hopes that the friends will give her all the necessary facilities to make  of her tour a real success. The report of her work in Australia and New  Zealand has been brilliant. There is no reason why she should not do the  same in India and Burma if she is given the chance, and be put in touch  with really open-minded and interested people. In America she is  considered among the first class national teachers and is well informed as  to the progress of modern thought and the teachings of the Cause. May be  she will be able to give a new impetus to the teaching work....    He trusts that through the efforts of you and the other members of the  National Assembly the Cause will take a real lead in uniting the different  elements existing in India and turn the face of its people to the light of  God shining through Baha'u'llah.    [From the Guardian:]    Your most welcome letter interrupting a prolonged silence on your part,  has brought joy and strength to my heart. I will most assuredly pray for  your complete recovery, for in you the Cause in India has an invaluable  asset which I, for my part, greatly value and prize. I trust and pray that  Mrs. Kehler's visit will lend a fresh impetus to the work which you are so  ably conducting. I would certainly advise her to prolong her stay in your  midst if it is practicable for her to do so. It is a splendid opportunity  which the friends in India should utilize to the utmost possible extent.  May the Beloved bless and reinforce your high endeavours, remove every  obstacle from your path, and enable you at once to broaden and reinforce  the foundations of the Faith in that troubled land.    February 11, 1932    Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear of the arrangements you have made for  the trip of Mrs. Ransom Kehler to India. Being thoroughly familiar with  the teachings and a competent speaker, she should succeed to render  wonderful services to the progress of the movement in India. She could be  easily ranked as a first class teacher among the Baha'is of America and  has been the cause of guidance to innumerable souls. Guided and helped by  Prof. Pritam Singh she should be able to awaken many souls to the spirit  and teachings of Baha'u'llah.    March 12, 1932          Translation of Baha'u'llah & the New Era      [From the Guardian:]    I wish to urge you to take as soon as you possibly can, the necessary and  most effective steps to ensure the translation of Dr. Esslemont's book  into Urdu and Gujrati. I have already expressed the desirability to have  these translations to a number of pilgrims, but so far my hopes have not  materialized. This book has already been translated and printed into eight  different languages, the latest being Russian, Hebrew and Chinese. The  Persian, the Albanian, the Bulgarian, the French and the Swedish versions  will be printed this year. I wish you to do all in your power to ensure  the speedy and correct translation of this book into these two languages,  and if necessary to hire the services of a competent non-Baha'i  translator. I shall be only too pleased to assist financially both with  regard to their translation and publication. May the Beloved guide and  assist you in this vital and important task.    March 12, 1932          Mrs. Kehler Visits Calcutta      Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  March 14th 1932 informing him about the arrival of Mrs. Ransom Kehler to  Calcutta. He was very glad to know that her visit was successful and that  it has very much stimulated the teaching work in that city. He sincerely  hopes that as a consequence a number of souls will enter the Cause and be  inspired by its divine teachings and ennobling spirit.    Such teachers of the Cause who, with all sincerity and determination,  undertake such long trips, should be very much helped by the resident  believers if real progress is to be achieved. They ought to be assisted to  reach important people speak to intelligent and receptive audiences, and  obtain interviews with persons whose heart is open to the light of God.  Otherwise, during their short stay they would, like a helpless man in a  strange country, be impotent to achieve their purpose.    Shoghi Effendi is very glad the friends have taken the necessary step to  assist Mrs. Ransom Kehler by appointing Professor Pritam Singh to  accompany her in her trip through India. May God help her and help you in  proclaiming the Word of God through the length and breadth of that vast  land.    March 28, 1932    He was very glad to learn of the plans you made for Mrs. Ransom Kehler. He  sincerely hopes that in these meetings and public lectures delivered in so  many cities, she has been able to attract some new souls to the Cause and  confirm people who until now have been merely interested. We should admit,  however, that the time at her disposal was too short to give her the  chance of doing her best. A teacher ought to remain at least a few months  in the same city if he wants to really confirm souls. Mere passing and  giving a lecture or two is not sufficient unless there are resident  Baha'is to continue the work that was merely started. Anyhow Mrs. Ransom  Kehler is expected to reach Haifa in about 3 weeks and Shoghi Effendi will  hear the report of her journey from herself.          Translation of Baha'u'llah and the New Era      The Guardian was very glad to learn of your quick response to his  expressed desire in having Dr. Esslemont's book translated into Urdu and  Gujrati. As he comes to learn from one of the Parsee pilgrims here in  Haifa, the book has already been translated by a competent Baha'i in India  into Gujrati. So there remains"]]]
