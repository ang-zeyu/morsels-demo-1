He resided in Barbary fourteen years,  during which the harms he did to the Christians are inexpressible.\"[9]    FOOTNOTES:    [8] Morgan, _Hist. of Algiers_, 233. (1731.)    [9] Morgan, 257.          V.    KHEYR-ED-D[=I]N BARBAROSSA.    1518-1530.      Ur[=u]j Barbarossa, the gallant, impulsive, reckless, lovable soldier  of fortune was dead, and it seemed as if all the power he had built up  by his indomitable energy must inevitably vanish with its founder. The  Marquis de Comares and the Spanish army held the fate of Algiers in  their hands; one steady march, and surely the Corsairs must be swept  out of Africa. But, with what would seem incredible folly, if it had  not been often repeated, the troops were shipped back to Spain, the  Marquis returned to his post at Oran, and the opportunity was lost for  three hundred years. The Algerines drew breath again, and their leader  began to prepare fresh schemes of conquest.    The mantle of Ur[=u]j had fallen upon worthy shoulders. The elder  brother possessed, indeed, matchless qualities for deeds of  derring-do; to lead a storming party, board a galleon,--cut and thrust  and \"have at you,\"--he had no equal: but Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n, with like  courage and determination, was gifted with prudent and statesmanlike  intelligence, which led him to greater enterprizes, though not to  more daring exploits. He measured the risk by the end, and never  exposed himself needlessly to the hazard of defeat; but when he saw  his way clear, none struck harder or more effectual blows.[10]    His first proceeding was typical of his sagacious mind. He sent an  ambassador to Constantinople, to lay his homage at the feet of the  Grand Signior, and to beg his Majesty's favour and protection for the  new province of Algiers, which was now by his humble servant added to  the Ottoman Empire. The reply was gracious. Sel[=i]m had just  conquered Egypt, and Algiers formed an important western extension of  his African dominion. The sage Corsair was immediately appointed  Beglerbeg, or Governor-General, of Algiers (1519), and invested with  the insignia of office, the horse and scimitar and horsetail-banner.  Not only this, but the Sultan sent a guard of two thousand Janissaries  to his viceroy's aid, and offered special inducements to such of his  subjects as would pass westward to Algiers and help to strengthen the  Corsair's authority.    [Illustration: OBSERVATION WITH THE CROSSBOW.    (_Jurien de la Graviere._)]    The Beglerbeg lost no time in repairing the damage of the Spaniards.  He reinforced his garrisons along the coast, at Meliana, Shersh[=e]l,  Tinnis, and Mustagh[=a]nim, and struck up alliances with the great  Arab tribes of the interior. An armada of some fifty men-of-war and  transports, including eight galleys-royal, under the command of  Admiral Don Hugo de Moncada, in vain landed an army of veterans on the  Algerine strand--they were driven back in confusion, and one of those  storms, for which the coast bears so evil a name, finished the work of  Turkish steel (1519). One after the other, the ports and strongholds  of Middle Barbary fell into the Corsair's hands: Col, Bona,  Constantine, owned the sway of Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n Barbarossa, who was now  free to resume his favourite occupation of scouring the seas in search  of Christian quarry. Once or twice in every year he would lead out  his own eighteen stout galleots, and call to his side other daring  spirits whom the renown of his name had drawn from the Levant, each  with his own swift cruiser manned by stout arms and the pick of  Turkish desperadoes. There you might see him surrounded by captains  who were soon to be famous wherever ships were to be seized or coasts  harried;--by Dragut, S[=a]lih Reis, Sin[=a]n the \"Jew of Smyrna,\" who  was suspected of black arts because he could take a declination with  the crossbow, and that redoubtable rover Ayd[=i]n Reis, whom the  Spaniards dubbed _Cachadiablo_, or \"Drub-devil,\" though he had better  been named Drub-Spaniard. The season for cruising began in May, and  lasted till the autumn storms warned vessels to keep the harbours, or  at least to attempt no distant expeditions. During the summer months  the Algerine galleots infested every part of the Western  Mediterranean, levied contributions of slaves and treasure upon the  Balearic Isles and the coasts of Spain, and even passed beyond the  straits to waylay the argosies which were returning to Cadiz laden  with the gold and jewels of the Indies. Nothing was safe from their  attacks; not a vessel ran the gauntlet of the Barbary coast in her  passage from Spain to Italy without many a heart quaking within her.  The \"Scourge of Christendom\" had begun, which was to keep all the  nations of Europe in perpetual alarm for three centuries. The Algerine  Corsairs were masters of the sea, and they made their mastery felt by  all who dared to cross their path; and not merchantmen only, but  galleys-royal of his Catholic Majesty learnt to dread the creak of the  Turkish rowlock.    One day in 1529 Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n despatched his trusty lieutenant  \"Drub-Devil\" with fourteen galleots to make a descent upon Majorca and  the neighbouring islands. No job could be more suited to the Corsair's  taste, and S[=a]lih Reis, who was with him, fully shared his enjoyment  of the task. The pair began in the usual way by taking several prizes  on the high seas, dropping down upon the islands and the Spanish  coasts, and carrying off abundance of Christians to serve at the oar,  or to purchase their liberty with those pieces-of-eight which never  came amiss to the rover's pockets. Tidings reaching them of a party of  Moriscos who were eager to make their escape from their Spanish  masters, and were ready to pay handsomely for a passage to Barbary.  \"Drub-Devil\" and his comrades landed by night near Oliva, embarked two  hundred families and much treasure, and lay-to under the island of  Formentara. Unfortunately General Portundo, with eight Spanish  galleys, was just then on his way back from Genoa, whither he had  conveyed Charles V. to be crowned Emperor by the Pope at Bologna; and,  being straightway informed of the piratical exploit which had taken  place, bore away for the Balearic Isles in hot pursuit. \"Drub-Devil\"  hastily landed his Morisco friends, to be the better prepared to fight  or run, for the sight of eight big galleys was more than he had  bargained for; but to his surprise the enemy came on, well within  gun-shot, without firing a single round. Portundo was anxious not to  sink the Turks, for fear of drowning the fugitive Moriscos, whom he  supposed to be on board, and for whose recapture he was to have ten  thousand ducats; but the Corsairs imputed his conduct to cowardice,  and, suddenly changing their part from attacked to attackers, they  swooped like eagles upon the galleys, and after a brisk hand-to-hand  combat, in which Portundo was slain, they carried seven of them by  assault, and sent the other flying at topmost speed to Ivica. This  bold stroke brought to Algiers, besides the Moriscos, who had watched  the battle anxiously from the island, many valuable captives of rank,  and released hundreds of Moslem galley-slaves from irons and the  lash.[11] \"Drub-Devil\" had a splendid reception, we may be sure, when  the people of Algiers saw seven royal galleys, including the  _capitana_, or flagship, of Spain, moored in their roads; and it is no  wonder that with such triumphs the new Barbary State flourished  exceedingly.    Fortified by a series of unbroken successes, Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n at last  ventured to attack the Spanish garrison, which had all this time  affronted him at the Penon de Alger. It was provoking to be obliged to  beach his galleots a mile to the west, and to drag them painfully up  the strand; and the merchantmen, moored east of the city, were exposed  to the weather to such a degree as to imperil their commerce.  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n resolved to have a port of his own at Algiers, with no  Spanish bridle to curb him. He summoned Don Martin de Vargas to  surrender, and, on his refusal, bombarded the Penon day and night for  fifteen days with heavy cannon, partly founded in Algiers, partly  seized from a French galleon, till an assault was practicable, when  the feeble remnant of the garrison was quickly overpowered and sent to  the bagnios. The stones of the fortress were used to build the great  mole which protects Algiers harbour on the west, and for two whole  years the Christian slaves were laboriously employed upon the work.    To aggravate this disaster, a curious sight was seen a fortnight after  the fall of the Penon. Nine transports, full of men and ammunition for  the reinforcement of the garrison, hove in sight, and long they  searched to and fro for the well-known fortress they had come to  succour. And whilst they marvelled that they could not discover it,  out dashed the Corsairs in their galleots and light sheb[=e]ks, and  seized the whole convoy, together with two thousand seven hundred  captives and a fine store of arms and provisions.[12]    Everything that Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n took in hand seemed to prosper. His  fleet increased month by month, till he had thirty-six of his own  galleots perpetually on the cruise in the summer season; his prizes  were innumerable, and his forces were increased by the fighting men of  the seventy thousand Moriscos whom he rescued, in a series of voyages,  from servitude in Spain. The waste places of Africa were peopled with  the industrious agriculturists and artisans whom the Spanish  Government knew not how to employ. The foundries and dockyards of  Algiers teemed with busy workmen. Seven thousand Christian slaves  laboured at the defensive works and the harbour; and every attempt of  the Emperor to rescue them and destroy the pirates was repelled with  disastrous loss.

When at last the man's incorrigible rudeness  brought about his dismissal Srikantha Babu anxiously interceded for him.  \"It was not he, it was the liquor,\" he insisted.    [Illustration: The Ganges]    He could not bear to see anyone sorrowing or even to hear of it. So when  any one of the boys wanted to torment him they had only to read out  passages from Vidyasagar's \"Banishment of Sita\"; whereat he would be  greatly exercised, thrusting out his hands in protest and begging and  praying of them to stop.    This old man was the friend alike of my father, my elder brothers and  ourselves. He was of an age with each and every one of us. As any piece  of stone is good enough for the freshet to dance round and gambol with,  so the least provocation would suffice to make him beside himself with  joy. Once I had composed a hymn, and had not failed to make due allusion  to the trials and tribulations of this world. Srikantha Babu was  convinced that my father would be overjoyed at such a perfect gem of a  devotional poem. With unbounded enthusiasm he volunteered personally to  acquaint him with it. By a piece of good fortune I was not there at the  time but heard afterwards that my father was hugely amused that the  sorrows of the world should have so early moved his youngest son to the  point of versification. I am sure Gobinda Babu, the superintendent,  would have shown more respect for my effort on so serious a subject.    In singing I was Srikantha Babu's favorite pupil. He had taught me a  song: \"No more of Vraja[18] for me,\" and would drag me about to  everyone's rooms and get me to sing it to them. I would sing and he  would thrum an accompaniment on his _sitar_ and when we came to the  chorus he would join in, and repeat it over and over again, smiling and  nodding his head at each one in turn, as if nudging them on to a more  enthusiastic appreciation.    He was a devoted admirer of my father. A hymn had been set to one of his  tunes, \"For He is the heart of our hearts.\" When he sang this to my  father Srikantha Babu got so excited that he jumped up from his seat and  in alternation violently twanged his _sitar_ as he sang: \"For He is the  heart of our hearts\" and then waved his hand about my father's face as  he changed the words to \"For _you_ are the heart of our hearts.\"    When the old man paid his last visit to my father, the latter, himself  bed-ridden, was at a river-side villa in Chinsurah. Srikantha Babu,  stricken with his last illness, could not rise unaided and had to push  open his eyelids to see. In this state, tended by his daughter, he  journeyed to Chinsurah from his place in Birbhoom. With a great effort  he managed to take the dust of my father's feet and then return to his  lodgings in Chinsurah where he breathed his last a few days later. I  heard afterwards from his daughter that he went to his eternal youth  with the song \"How sweet is thy mercy, Lord!\" on his lips.          (11) _Our Bengali Course Ends_      At School we were then in the class below the highest one. At home we  had advanced in Bengali much further than the subjects taught in the  class. We had been through Akshay Datta's book on Popular Physics, and  had also finished the epic of Meghnadvadha. We read our physics without  any reference to physical objects and so our knowledge of the subject  was correspondingly bookish. In fact the time spent on it had been  thoroughly wasted; much more so to my mind than if it had been wasted in  doing nothing. The Meghnadvadha, also, was not a thing of joy to us. The  tastiest tit-bit may not be relished when thrown at one's head. To  employ an epic to teach language is like using a sword to shave  with--sad for the sword, bad for the chin. A poem should be taught from  the emotional standpoint; inveigling it into service as  grammar-cum-dictionary is not calculated to propitiate the divine  Saraswati.    All of a sudden our Normal School career came to an end; and thereby  hangs a tale. One of our school teachers wanted to borrow a copy of my  grandfather's life by Mitra from our library. My nephew and classmate  Satya managed to screw up courage enough to volunteer to mention this to  my father. He came to the conclusion that everyday Bengali would hardly  do to approach him with. So he concocted and delivered himself of an  archaic phrase with such meticulous precision that my father must have  felt our study of the Bengali language had gone a bit too far and was in  danger of over-reaching itself. So the next morning, when according to  our wont our table had been placed in the south verandah, the blackboard  hung up on a nail in the wall, and everything was in readiness for our  lessons with Nilkamal Babu, we three were sent for by my father to his  room upstairs. \"You need not do any more Bengali lessons,\" he said. Our  minds danced for very joy.    Nilkamal Babu was waiting downstairs, our books were lying open on the  table, and the idea of getting us once more to go through the  Meghnadvadha doubtless still occupied his mind. But as on one's  death-bed the various routine of daily life seems unreal, so, in a  moment, did everything, from the Pandit down to the nail on which the  blackboard was hung, become for us as empty as a mirage. Our sole  trouble was how to give this news to Nilkamal Babu with due decorum. We  did it at last with considerable restraint, while the geometrical  figures on the blackboard stared at us in wonder and the blank verse of  the Meghnadvadha looked blankly on.    Our Pandit's parting words were: \"At the call of duty I may have been  sometimes harsh with you--do not keep that in remembrance. You will  learn the value of what I have taught you later on.\"    Indeed I have learnt that value. It was because we were taught in our  own language that our minds quickened. Learning should as far as  possible follow the process of eating. When the taste begins from the  first bite, the stomach is awakened to its function before it is loaded,  so that its digestive juices get full play. Nothing like this happens,  however, when the Bengali boy is taught in English. The first bite bids  fair to wrench loose both rows of teeth--like a veritable earthquake in  the mouth! And by the time he discovers that the morsel is not of the  genus stone, but a digestible bonbon, half his allotted span of life is  over. While one is choking and spluttering over the spelling and  grammar, the inside remains starved, and when at length the taste is  felt, the appetite has vanished. If the whole mind does not work from  the beginning its full powers remain undeveloped to the end. While all  around was the cry for English teaching, my third brother was brave  enough to keep us to our Bengali course. To him in heaven my grateful  reverence.          (12) _The Professor_      On leaving the Normal School we were sent to the Bengal Academy, a  Eurasian institution. We felt we had gained an access of dignity, that  we had grown up--at least into the first storey of freedom. In point of  fact the only progress we made in that academy was towards freedom. What  we were taught there we never understood, nor did we make any attempt to  learn, nor did it seem to make any difference to anybody that we did  not. The boys here were annoying but not disgusting--which was a great  comfort. They wrote ASS on their palms and slapped it on to our backs  with a cordial \"hello!\" They gave us a dig in the ribs from behind and  looked innocently another way. They dabbed banana pulp on our heads and  made away unperceived. Nevertheless it was like coming out of slime on  to rock--we were worried but not soiled.    This school had one great advantage for me. No one there cherished the  forlorn hope that boys of our sort could make any advance in learning.  It was a petty institution with an insufficient income, so that we had  one supreme merit in the eyes of its authorities--we paid our fees  regularly. This prevented even the Latin Grammar from proving a  stumbling block, and the most egregious of blunders left our backs  unscathed. Pity for us had nothing to do with it--the school authorities  had spoken to the teachers!    Still, harmless though it was, after all it was a school. The rooms were  cruelly dismal with their walls on guard like policemen. The house was  more like a pigeon-holed box than a human habitation. No decoration, no  pictures, not a touch of colour, not an attempt to attract the boyish  heart. The fact that likes and dislikes form a large part of the child  mind was completely ignored. Naturally our whole being was depressed as  we stepped through its doorway into the narrow quadrangle--and playing  truant became chronic with us.    In this we found an accomplice. My elder brothers had a Persian tutor.  We used to call him Munshi. He was of middle age and all skin and bone,  as though dark parchment had been stretched over his skeleton without  any filling of flesh and blood. He probably knew Persian well, his  knowledge of English was quite fair, but in neither of these directions  lay his ambition. His belief was that his proficiency in singlestick  was matched only by his skill in song. He would stand in the sun in the  middle of our courtyard and go through a wonderful series of antics with  a staff--his own shadow being his antagonist. I need hardly add that his  shadow never got the better of him and when at the end he gave a great  big shout and whacked it on the head with a victorious smile, it lay  submissively prone at his feet. His singing, nasal and out of tune,  sounded like a gruesome mixture of groaning and moaning coming from some  ghost-world. Our singing master Vishnu would sometimes chaff him: \"Look  here, Munshi, you'll be taking the bread out of our mouths at this  rate!\" To which his only reply would be a disdainful smile.    This shows that the Munshi was amenable to soft words; and in fact,  whenever we wanted we could persuade him to "]]]
