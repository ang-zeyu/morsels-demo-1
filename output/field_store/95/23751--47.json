Some of the cargoes carried by these Nile boats are worth describing,  and large numbers are employed in carrying \"tibbin\" from the farms to  the larger towns. \"Tibbin\" is the chopped straw upon which horses and  cattle in the towns are mainly fed, and it is loaded on to the boats  in a huge pyramidical pile carried upon planks which considerably  overhang the boat's sides. The steersman is placed upon the top of  this stack, and is enabled to guide his vessel by a long pole lashed  to the tiller, and it is curious to notice that the \"tibbin,\" though  finely chopped, does not appear to blow away.    In a somewhat similar manner the immense quantity of balass and other  water-pots, which are manufactured at Girgeh, Sohag, and other places  on the Upper Nile, are transported down-stream. In this case, however,  large beams of wood are laid across the boats, which are often loaded  in couples lashed together, and from which are slung nets upon which  the water-pots are piled to the height of 10 or 12 feet, and one may  often meet long processions of these boats slowly drifting down stream  to Assiut or Cairo.    Another frequent cargo is sugar-cane, perhaps the greatest industry of  the upper river, and at Manfalut, Rhoda, Magaga, and many other places  large sugar factories have sprung into existence of late years. The  trade is a very profitable one for Egypt, but, unfortunately, their  tall chimneys and ugly factories, which are always built close to the  Nile bank, are doing much to spoil the beauties of the river, and,  worst of all, noisy little steam tugs and huge iron barges are yearly  becoming more numerous.    Though, as we have seen, crocodiles have long ago left the Lower Nile,  the river abounds in fish, and from the terraces of its banks one may  constantly see fishermen throwing their hand-nets, while in the  shallows and backwaters of the river, drag-nets are frequently  employed. I recently watched the operation, which I will describe.  Beginning at the lower end of the reach, seven men were employed in  working the net, three at either end to haul it, while another, wading  in the middle, supported it at the centre. Meanwhile two of their  party had run far up the banks, one on either side, and then, entering  the water, slowly descended towards the nets, shouting and beating the  water with sticks, thus driving the fish towards the nets. Usually the  fish so caught are small, or of only moderate size, though I have  frequently seen exposed for sale in the markets fish weighing upwards  of 300 pounds and 6 feet or more in length.    The Nile Valley is comparatively wide for a considerable distance  above Cairo, and while the hills which fringe the Lybian desert are  generally in view in the distance, those on the eastern side gradually  close in upon the river as we ascend, and in many places, such as  Gibel Kasr-es-Saad, or \"the castle of the hunter,\" Feshun, or Gibel  Abou Fedr, rise almost perpendicularly from the river to the height of  1,000 feet or more, and although considerable areas of cultivated land  are to be found at intervals on the eastern side, practically all the  agricultural land of Upper Egypt lies on the western bank of the  river.    The rock of which the hills are formed is limestone, and it is a very  dazzling sight as you pass some of these precipitous cliffs in the  brilliant sunshine, especially where the quarrymen are working and the  sunburnt outside has been removed, exposing the pure whiteness of the  stone.    Along the narrow bank of shingle at the foot of the cliffs flocks of  dark-coated sheep and goats wander in search of such scant herbage as  may be found along the water's edge, and many native boats lie along  the banks loading the stone extracted by the quarrymen, who look like  flies on the face of the rock high above you. Enormous quantities of  stone are required for the building of the various dams and locks on  the river, as well as for the making of embankments and \"spurs.\" These  \"spurs\" are little embankments which project into the river at a  slight angle pointing down-stream, and are made in order to turn the  direction of the current towards the middle of the river, and so  protect the banks from the scour of the water; for each year a portion  of the banks is lost, and in many places large numbers of palm-trees  and dwellings are swept away, for the native seems incapable of  learning how unwise it is to build at the water's edge. Sometimes  whole fields are washed away by the flood, and the soil, carried  down-stream, forms a new island, or is perhaps deposited on the  opposite side of the river many miles below. When this occurs, the new  land so formed is held to be the property of the farmer or landowner  who has suffered loss.    These changes of the river-banks are often rapid. One year vessels may  discharge their passengers or cargoes upon the bank whereon some town  or village is built, and which the following year may be separated  from the river by fields many acres in extent; and each year in going  up the Nile one may notice striking changes in this way.    As the Nile winds in its course the rocky hills on either side  alternately approach close to the river, revealing a succession of  rock-hewn tombs or ancient monasteries, or recede far into the  distance, half hidden in the vegetation of the arable land; but,  speaking generally, the river flows principally on the eastern side of  the valley, while all the large towns, such as Wasta, Minyeh, Assiut,  or Girgeh are built upon the western bank, where the largest area of  fertility is situated.    As we ascend the river the vegetation slowly changes; cotton and  wheat, so freely grown in the Delta, give place to sugar-cane and  Indian corn, and the feathery foliage of the sunt and mimosa trees is  more in evidence than the more richly clad lebbek or sycamore.    In many places are fields of the large-leaved castor-oil plants, whose  crimson flower contrasts with the delicately tinted blossoms of the  poppies which, for the sake of their opium, are grown upon the  shelving banks. The dom palm also is a new growth, and denotes our  approach to tropical regions, while the type and costume of the people  have undergone a change, for they are darker and broader in feature  than the people of Lower Egypt, and the prevailing colour of their  clothing is a dark brown, the natural colour of their sheep, from  whose wool their heavy homespun cloth is made.    The limestone hills which have been our companions since leaving Cairo  also disappear, and a little way above Luxor low hills of sandstone  closely confine the river in a very narrow channel. This is the Gibel  Silsileh, which from the earliest times has supplied the stone of  which the temples are built. These celebrated quarries produce the  finest stone in the country, and have always been worked in the most  scientific and methodical manner, deep cuttings following the veins  of good stone which only was extracted, while the river front has  remained practically untouched--a contrast to the modern method of  quarrying, where the most striking bluffs upon the Nile are being  recklessly blown away, causing an enormous waste of material as well  as seriously affecting the beauty of the scenery.          CHAPTER VII    THE NILE--III      After a river journey of 583 miles from Cairo, Assuan is  reached--limit of Egypt proper and the beginning of an entirely new  phase of Nile scenery. Cultivation in any large sense has been left  behind, and we are now in Nubia, a land of rock and sand, sparsely  inhabited, and, excepting in very small patches along the water's  edge, producing no crops.    [Illustration: FIRST CATARACT FROM ELEPHANTINE ISLAND.]    Built at the northern end of what is called the first cataract, Assuan  is perhaps the most interesting and prettily-situated town in Upper  Egypt. Facing the green island of Elephantine and the golden  sand-drifts which cover the low range of hills across the river,  Assuan stretches along the river-bank, its white buildings partly  screened by the avenue of palms and lebbek-trees which shade its  principal street, while to the north are dense groves of date-palms,  past which the Nile sweeps in a splendid curve and is lost to sight  among the hills. Behind, beyond its open-air markets and the  picturesque camp of the Besharin, the desert stretches unbroken to  the shores of the Red Sea.    The bazaars of Assuan are extremely picturesque, and are covered  almost throughout their length; the lanes which constitute them are  narrow and winding, forming enticing vistas whose distances are  emphasized by the occasional glints of sunlight which break in upon  their generally subdued light. In the shops are exposed for sale all  those various goods and commodities which native life demands; but  visitors are mostly attracted by the stalls of the curio sellers, who  display a strange medley of coloured beads and baskets, rich  embroideries, stuffed animals, and large quantities of arms and  armour, so-called trophies of the wars in the Sudan. Though most of  these relics are spurious, genuine helmets and coats of mail of old  Persian and Saracenic times may occasionally be found, while large  numbers of spears and swords are undoubtedly of Dervish manufacture.    For most Englishmen Assuan has also a tragic interest in its  association with the expedition for the relief of General Gordon, and  the subsequent Mahdist wars, when regiment after regiment of British  soldiers passed through her streets on their way towards those burning  deserts from which so many of them were destined never to return.  Those were exciting, if anxious, days for Assuan, and many visitors  will remember how, some years ago, the presence of Dervish horsemen in  its immediate vicinity rendered it unsafe for them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#8)"],[1,"she would be made Empress it  might have been different, but with so many others sharing Chow-sin's  favour, her promotion to first place in the Great One's household was by  no means certain. Besides, she was Su-nan's favourite child, and the old  man could not bear the thought of separation from her. Rather would he  give up his life than let her go to this cruel ruler.    \"No, you shall not do it,\" said he to Ta-ki, \"not though I must die to  save you.\"    The beautiful girl listened to her father's words, in tears. Throwing  herself at his feet she thanked him for his mercy and promised to love  him more fondly than ever. She told him that her vanity had not been  flattered by what most girls might have thought an honour, that she  would rather have the love of one good man like her father, than share  with others the affections of a king.    After listening to his daughter, the viceroy sent a respectful answer to  the palace, thanking the Emperor for his favour, but saying he could not  give up Ta-ki. \"She is unworthy of the honour you purpose doing her,\" he  said, in conclusion, \"for, having been the apple of her father's eye,  she would not be happy to share even your most august favour with the  many others you have chosen.\"    [Illustration: \"THROWING HERSELF AT HIS FEET SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS  MERCY.\"]    When the Emperor learned of Su-nan's reply he could hardly believe his  ears. To have his command thus disobeyed was an unheard-of crime. Never  before had a subject of the Middle Kingdom offered such an insult to a  ruler. Boiling with rage, he ordered his prime minister to send forth  an army that would bring the viceroy to his senses. \"Tell him if he  disobeys that he and his family, together with all they possess, shall  be destroyed.\"    Delighted at the success of his plot against Su-nan, the Prime Minister  sent a regiment of soldiers to bring the rebel to terms. In the meantime  the friends of the daring viceroy had not been idle. Hearing of the  danger threatening their ruler, who had become a general favourite,  hundreds of men offered him their aid against the army of Chow-sin. Thus  when the Emperor's banners were seen approaching and the war drums were  heard rolling in the distance, the rebels, with a great shout, dashed  forth to do battle for their leader. In the fight that took place the  Imperial soldiers were forced to run.    When the Emperor heard of this defeat he was hot with anger. He called  together his advisers and commanded that an army, double the size of the  first one, should be sent to Su-nan's country to destroy the fields and  villages of the people who had risen up against him. \"Spare not one of  them,\" he shouted, \"for they are traitors to the Dragon Throne.\"    Once more the viceroy's friends resolved to support him, even to the  death. Ta-ki, his daughter, went apart from the other members of the  family, weeping most bitterly that she had brought such sorrow upon  them. \"Rather would I go into the palace and be the lowest among  Chow-sin's women than to be the cause of all this grief,\" she cried,  in desperation.    But her father soothed her, saying, \"Be of good cheer, Ta-ki. The  Emperor's army, though it be twice as large as mine, shall not overcome  us. Right is on our side. The gods of battle will help those who fight  for justice.\"    One week later a second battle was fought, and the struggle was so close  that none could foresee the result. The Imperial army was commanded by  the oldest nobles in the kingdom, those most skilled in warfare, while  the viceroy's men were young and poorly drilled. Moreover, the members  of the Dragon Army had been promised double pay if they should  accomplish the wishes of their sovereign, while Su-nan's soldiers knew  only too well that they would be put to the sword if they should be  defeated.    Just as the clash of arms was at its highest, the sound of gongs was  heard upon a distant hill. The government troops were amazed at seeing  fresh companies marching to the rescue of their foe. With a wild cry of  disappointment they turned and fled from the field. These unexpected  reinforcements turned out to be women whom Ta-ki had persuaded to dress  up as soldiers and go with her for the purpose of frightening the enemy.  Thus for a second time was Su-nan victorious.    During the following year several battles occurred that counted for  little, except that in each of them many of Su-nan's followers were  killed. At last one of the viceroy's best friends came to him, saying,  \"Noble lord, it is useless to continue the struggle. I fear you must  give up the fight. You have lost more than half your supporters; the  remaining bowmen are either sick or wounded and can be of little use.  The Emperor, moreover, is even now raising a new army from the distant  provinces, and will soon send against us a force ten times as great as  any we have yet seen. There being no hope of victory, further fighting  would be folly. Lead, therefore, your daughter to the palace. Throw  yourself upon the mercy of the throne. You must accept cheerfully the  fate the gods have suffered you to bear.\"    Ta-ki, chancing to overhear this conversation, rushed in and begged her  father to hold out no longer, but to deliver her up to the greed of the  wicked Chow-sin.    With a sigh, the viceroy yielded to their wishes. The next day he  despatched a messenger to the Emperor, promising to bring Ta-ki at once  to the capital.    Now we must not forget Fox Sprite, the demon, who had been commanded by  the good goddess Lu-o to bring a dreadful punishment upon the Emperor.  Through all the years of strife between Chow-sin and the rebels, Fox  Sprite had been waiting patiently for his chance. He knew well that some  day, sooner or later, there would come an hour when Chow-sin would be at  his mercy. When the time came, therefore, for Ta-ki to go to the palace,  Fox Sprite felt that at last his chance had come. The beautiful maiden  for whom Chow-sin had given up so many hundreds of his soldiers, would  clearly have great power over the Emperor. She must be made to help  in the punishment of her wicked husband. So Fox Sprite made himself  invisible and travelled with the viceroy's party as it went from central  China to the capital.    On the last night of their journey Su-nan and his daughter stopped for  rest and food at a large inn. No sooner had the girl gone to her room  for the night than Fox Sprite followed her. Then he made himself  visible. At first she was frightened to see so strange a being in her  room, but when Fox Sprite told her he was a servant of the great  goddess, Lu-o, she was comforted, for she knew that Lu-o was the friend  of women and children.    \"But how can _I_ help to punish the Emperor?\" she faltered, when the  sprite told her he wanted her assistance. \"I am but a helpless girl,\"  and here she began to cry.    \"Dry your tears,\" he said soothingly. \"It will be very easy. Only let me  take your form for a little. When I am the Emperor's wife,\" laughing, \"I  shall find a way to punish him, for no one can give a man more pain that  his wife can, if she desires to do so. You know, I am a servant of Lu-o  and can do anything I wish.\"    \"But the Emperor won't have a fox for a wife,\" she sobbed.    \"Though I am still a fox I shall look like the beautiful Ta-ki. Make  your heart easy. He will never know.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" she smiled, \"you will put your spirit into my body and you  will look just like me, though you really won't be me. But what will  become of the real me? Shall I have to be a fox and look like you?\"    \"No, not unless you want to. I will make you invisible, and you can be  ready to go back into your own body when I have got rid of the Emperor.\"    \"Very well,\" replied the girl, somewhat relieved by his explanation,  \"but try not to be too long about it, because I don't like the idea of  somebody else walking about in my body.\"    So Fox Sprite caused his own spirit to enter the girl's body, and no  one could have told by her outward appearance that any change had taken  place. The beautiful girl was now in reality the sly Fox Sprite, but in  one way only did she look like a fox. When the fox-spirit entered her  body, her feet suddenly shrivelled up and became very similar in shape  and size to the feet of the animal who had her in his power. When the  fox noticed this, at first he was somewhat annoyed, but, feeling that no  one else would know, he did not take the trouble to change the fox feet  back to human form.    On the following morning, when the viceroy called his daughter for the  last stage of their journey, he greeted Fox Sprite without suspecting  that anything unusual had happened since he had last seen Ta-ki. So well  did this crafty spirit perform his part that the father was completely  deceived, by look, by voice, and by gesture.    The next day the travellers arrived at the capital and Su-nan presented  himself before Chow-sin, the Emperor, leading Fox Sprite with him. Of  course the crafty fox with all his magic powers was soon able to gain  the mastery over the wicked ruler. The Great One pardoned Su-nan,  although he had fully intended to put him to death as a rebel.    Now the chance for which Fox Sprite had been waiting had come. He began  at once, causing the Emperor to do many deeds of violence. The people  had already begun to dislike Chow-sin, and soon he became hateful in  their sight. Many of the leading members of the court were put to death  unjustly. Horrible tortures were devised for punishing those who did not  find favour with the crown. At last there was open talk of a rebellion.  Of course, all these things delighted the wily fox, for he saw that,  sooner or later, the Son of Heaven would be turned out of the palace,  and he knew that then his work for the goddess Lu-o would be finished.    Besides worming his way into the heart of the Emperor, the fox became  a general favourite"]]]
