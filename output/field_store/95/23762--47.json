Crossing the Seine, one is in the land of cider and Pont l'Eveque  cheese. At Honfleur you will find a very good _table-d'hote_ at the  old-fashioned Cheval Blanc on the Quai; and at the Ferme St-Simeon up on  the hill, in beautifully wooded ground, there is to be obtained some  particularly good sparkling cider. Honfleur has a special reputation for  its shrimps and prawns.      Trouville Deauville    During the Trouville fortnight, when all the world descends upon  Trouville, the various big hotels and the Casino have more clients than  they really can cater for. At the Roches Noires one is likely to be kept  waiting for a table, and at the Casino a harassed waiter thrusts a red  mullet before one, when one has ordered a sole. The _moules_ of  Trouville are supposed to be particularly good, and also the fish. There  are _table-d'hote_ meals at the restaurants of the Helder and De la  Plage, the second being the cheaper of the two, and food is to be  obtained at the little Cafe Restaurant on the edge of the _promenade des  planches_. But Trouville in the season may be taken to be exiled Paris  in a fever, half as expensive again, and not half so \"well done.\"    Of the little bathing-places immediately east of  Trouville--Houlgate-Beuzeval, Dives, Cabourg--there is little or nothing  to say. At Cabourg the Hotel des Ducs de Normandie has some kiosks with  a full view of the sea, where it is pleasant to breakfast, and the  Casino can always be taken for granted as a _pis aller_ at all these  little bathing-places. The quaintness of the old inn Guillaume le  Conquerant at Dives counts for something, and the 5 franc _table-d'hote_  dinner there is good of its kind.      Caen    _Tripes a la mode de Caen_ may be a homely dish but it is not to be  despised, and it can be eaten quite at its best in the town where it was  invented. I have eaten it with great content at a bourgeois restaurant,  opposite to the Church of St-Pierre, the Restaurant Pepin, if my memory  serves me rightly, and a _Sole Bordeaux_ to precede it. The proprietor,  M. Chandivert, was very anxious that I should add a _Caneton Rouennaise_  to the feast, but I told him that \"to every town its dish.\" He gave me a  capital pint of red wine, and impressed on me the fact that he had  obtained a gold medal at some exhibition for his _andouillettes_. Caen  is the town of the _charcutiers_, and you may see more good cold viands  shown in windows, in a walk through its streets, than you will find  anywhere else outside a cookery exhibition. Caen is an oasis in the  midst of the bad cookery of Western Normandy; and the restaurant at the  Hotel d'Angleterre and the Restaurant de Madrid are very much above the  average of the restaurant of a French country town. In both restaurants  you can dine and breakfast in the shade in the open air, the Madrid  having a good garden, the Angleterre a great tent in the courtyard,--a  welcome change from the stuffy rooms, full of flies, of most Normandy  hotels. I have a most pleasant memory of a _Homard Americaine_, cooked  at the Hotel d'Angleterre, which was the very best lobster I ever ate in  my life. The old _chef_ who made the fame of the Angleterre has retired,  but his successor is said to show no falling off in the art of preparing  a good dinner. I would suggest to the wayfarer to breakfast in the  garden of the Madrid and dine at the Angleterre. There is a little  restaurant, A la Tour des Gens d'Armes, on the left bank of the canal  which is much frequented by students, and where an _al fresco_ lunch is  served at a very small price. The food is good for the money, and there  is always a chance of finding some merry gathering there. A note of  warning should be sounded as to the cider and _vin ordinaire_ supplied  as part of the _table-d'hote_ dinners in Caen, and indeed everywhere in  Normandy. There is almost invariably good cider to be had and good wine  on payment, but the cider and wine usually put on the table rival each  other as throat-cutting beverages. Vieux Calvados is an excellent  _pousse cafe_. It reads almost like a fairy-tale to be able to recount  that the delicious oysters from the coast-villages of Ouistreham and  Courseulles can be bought at 50 centimes the dozen or very little more.      Cherbourg    This calling-place for Atlantic steamers is a very likely place for the  earnest gourmet to find himself stranded in for a day, and I regret that  there is no gastronomic find to report there. A most competent authority  writes thus to me on the capabilities of the place:--    \"There are no restaurants, in the true sense of the word, in Cherbourg.    \"The leading hotel, where most of the people go, and which is the  largest, with the best cuisine and service, is the Hotel du Casino. This  hotel is managed by Monsieur Marius, and though partially shut during  the winter season, travellers can always get a good plain dinner there.  During the summer season, that is from May till October, the hotel is  fully open, and has a _petits chevaux_ room, entry free of course, and  also good military music in the gardens, twice a week. The gardens are  also very prettily illuminated very often, whilst from time to time  firework displays help to pass away the evenings. The dining-hall faces  the only nice portion of beach in the town, and being entirely covered  in with glass, is warm in winter and cool in summer, when it can all be  open. The meals are usually _table-d'hote_, but it is possible also to  order a dinner if one prefers to do so. Here also the traveller will  find a little English spoken among the waiters and management, which may  be useful to him. The wines are pretty good, but there is no very  special brand for which the place is known; also good Scotch and Irish  whisky can be obtained at a reasonable price; the hotel does not boast  of any special _plat_ either.    \"The Hotel de France, another fair-sized hotel, is the one patronised  mostly by the naval and military authorities of the town, but is not so  amusing a place for the traveller to stay at or dine at; though I  understand that the dinner to be obtained there is in every way  satisfactory.    \"Finally, I might mention two other hotels at which one can dine  comfortably; these are the Hotel d'Amiraute and the Hotel d'Angleterre,  at both of which a good plain dinner is served.    \"The chief joint obtainable here to be recommended is of course the  mutton, as Cherbourg is noted for its _pre-sale_ all over France; but  beyond this the food is of the usual ordinary kind to be obtained in  most French towns of this size.\"    M. Roche, who made a little fortune in London in Old Compton Street, has  taken a little hotel near Granville, and as he learned cooking under  Frederic of the Tour d'Argent, he may be depended upon for an excellent  meal.      Breton Resorts    Of the land of butter and eggs I have not much to write. Correspondents  at St-Malo say a good word of the feeding both at the Hotel de l'Univers  and the Hotel du Centre et de la Paix; but I cannot speak of either of  these from personal knowledge, nor do I know anything of Dinard, though  it is said that the best cookery in the province is found there. Cancale  of course has its oyster-beds, and the esculent bivalve can be eaten  within sight of the mud-flat on which it erstwhile reposed. The one  restaurant in this part of the world for which every one has a good word  is that of Poulard Aine at Mont St-Michel, where there is a cheap  _table-d'hote_ and where a good meal _a la carte_ is also to be  obtained.    Artichokes, prawns, potatoes, _langouste_, eggs, lobsters, crabs, are  good all along the Breton coast; and at Quimper, at the Hotel de l'Epee,  you can--if you are in luck--get fresh sardines.    Here is a typical Breton menu, one of the meals at the Hotel des Bains  de Mer, Roscoff:--             Artichauts a l'Huile.         Pommes de terre a l'Huile.      Porc frais froid aux Cornichons.           Langouste Mayonnaise.            Canards aux Navets.           Omelette fines Herbes.             Filet aux Pommes.            Fromage a la Creme.           Fruits, biscuits, etc.            Cidre a discretion.    This is rather a terrible mass of food ranged in the strangest order,  but I insert it to show the traveller in Brittany that he need never  think his meal ended when he reaches the omelette, and that he had  better take a gargantuan appetite with him.    Apart from being a good homely place to stay at, La Villa Julia at Pont  Aven is worth a visit, for it has been the temporary home of many of the  greatest French painters, notably poor Bastien Lepage. They are  welcome, and are provided with studios, only being charged 5 francs a  day \"pension.\" \"The country is charming\" writes an enthusiastic  correspondent \"and one lingers there, and the food is excellent. Even  were it not, dear old Mlle. Julia is worth a journey. She is one of the  most delightful of French landladies. In the old inn the walls of one  large room are covered with pictures and sketches given her by her  _chers artistes_.\"      Brest    This great naval town has better cafes than it has dining or lunching  places; the Cafe Brestois in the Rue de Siam, and the Grand Cafe in the  same street being both good. Besides the restaurants attached to the  Hotels des Voyageurs, Rue de Siam, Continentale, and de France in the  Rue de la Mairie, there are the Restaurant Aury and the Brasserie de la  Marine, both on the Champ de Bataille, but I have no details concerning  them.

There was nothing indolent about him, but his appearance  spoke of tranquillity. He was one of those who never seemed to expect  anything from anybody, who liked to work when he thought proper, and  whose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble.    I began to comprehend his character, simply from the way in which he  listened to the wild and impassioned verbiage of my worthy uncle. While  the excellent Professor spoke sentence after sentence, he stood with  folded arms, utterly still, motionless to all my uncle's gesticulations.  When he wanted to say No he moved his head from left to right; when he  acquiesced he nodded, so slightly that you could scarcely see the  undulation of his head. This economy of motion was carried to the length  of avarice.    Judging from his appearance I should have been a long time before I had  suspected him to be what he was, a mighty hunter. Certainly his manner  was not likely to frighten the game. How, then, did he contrive to get  at his prey?    My surprise was slightly modified when I knew that this tranquil and  solemn personage was only a hunter of the eider duck, the down of which  is, after all, the greatest source of the Icelanders' wealth.    In the early days of summer, the female of the eider, a pretty sort of  duck, builds its nest amid the rocks of the fjords--the name given to  all narrow gulfs in Scandinavian countries--with which every part of the  island is indented. No sooner has the eider duck made her nest than she  lines the inside of it with the softest down from her breast. Then comes  the hunter or trader, taking away the nest, the poor bereaved female  begins her task over again, and this continues as long as any eider down  is to be found.    When she can find no more the male bird sets to work to see what he can  do. As, however, his down is not so soft, and has therefore no  commercial value, the hunter does not take the trouble to rob him of his  nest lining. The nest is accordingly finished, the eggs are laid, the  little ones are born, and next year the harvest of eider down is again  collected.    Now, as the eider duck never selects steep rocks or aspects to build its  nest, but rather sloping and low cliffs near to the sea, the Icelandic  hunter can carry on his trade operations without much difficulty. He is  like a farmer who has neither to plow, to sow, nor to harrow, only to  collect his harvest.    This grave, sententious, silent person, as phlegmatic as an Englishman  on the French stage, was named Hans Bjelke. He had called upon us in  consequence of the recommendation of M. Fridriksson. He was, in fact,  our future guide. It struck me that had I sought the world over, I could  not have found a greater contradiction to my impulsive uncle.    They, however, readily understood one another. Neither of them had any  thought about money; one was ready to take all that was offered him, the  other ready to offer anything that was asked. It may readily be  conceived, then, that an understanding was soon come to between them.    Now, the understanding was, that he was to take us to the village of  Stapi, situated on the southern slope of the peninsula of Sneffels, at  the very foot of the volcano. Hans, the guide, told us the distance was  about twenty-two miles, a journey which my uncle supposed would take  about two days.    But when my uncle came to understand that they were Danish miles, of  eight thousand yards each, he was obliged to be more moderate in his  ideas, and, considering the horrible roads we had to follow, to allow  eight or ten days for the journey.    Four horses were prepared for us, two to carry the baggage, and two to  bear the important weight of myself and uncle. Hans declared that  nothing ever would make him climb on the back of any animal. He knew  every inch of that part of the coast, and promised to take us the very  shortest way.    His engagement with my uncle was by no means to cease with our arrival  at Stapi; he was further to remain in his service during the whole time  required for the completion of his scientific investigations, at the  fixed salary of three rix-dollars a week, being exactly fourteen  shillings and twopence, minus one farthing, English currency. One  stipulation, however, was made by the guide--the money was to be paid to  him every Saturday night, failing which, his engagement was at an end.    The day of our departure was fixed. My uncle wished to hand the  eider-down hunter an advance, but he refused in one emphatic word--    \"Efter.\"    Which being translated from Icelandic into plain English means--\"After.\"    The treaty concluded, our worthy guide retired without another word.    \"A splendid fellow,\" said my uncle; \"only he little suspects the  marvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world.\"    \"You mean, then,\" I cried in amazement, \"that he should accompany us?\"    \"To the interior of the earth, yes,\" replied my uncle. \"Why not?\"    There were yet forty-eight hours to elapse before we made our final  start. To my great regret, our whole time was taken up in making  preparations for our journey. All our industry and ability were devoted  to packing every object in the most advantageous manner--the instruments  on one side, the arms on the other, the tools here and the provisions  there. There were, in fact, four distinct groups.    The instruments were of course of the best manufacture:    1. A centigrade thermometer of Eigel, counting up to 150 degrees, which  to me did not appear half enough--or too much. Too hot by half, if the  degree of heat was to ascend so high--in which case we should certainly  be cooked--not enough, if we wanted to ascertain the exact temperature  of springs or metal in a state of fusion.    2. A manometer worked by compressed air, an instrument used to ascertain  the upper atmospheric pressure on the level of the ocean. Perhaps a  common barometer would not have done as well, the atmospheric pressure  being likely to increase in proportion as we descended below the surface  of the earth.    3. A first-class chronometer made by Boissonnas, of Geneva, set at the  meridian of Hamburg, from which Germans calculate, as the English do  from Greenwich, and the French from Paris.    4. Two compasses, one for horizontal guidance, the other to ascertain  the dip.    5. A night glass.    6. Two Ruhmkorff coils, which, by means of a current of electricity,  would ensure us a very excellent, easily carried, and certain means of  obtaining light.    7. A voltaic battery on the newest principle.[1]    [1] Thermometer (<i>thermos</i>, and <i>metron</i>, measure); an instrument for  measuring the temperature of the air.--Manometer (<i>manos</i>,and <i>metron</i>,  measure); an instrument to show the density or rarity of  gases.--Chronometer (<i>chronos</i>. time, and <i>metros</i>, measure) a time  measurer, or superior watch--Ruhmkorff's coil, an instrument for  producing currents of induced electricity of great intensity. It  consists of a coil of copper wire, insulated by being covered with silk,  surrounded by another coil of fine wire, also insulated, in which a  momentary current is induced when a current is passed through the inner  coil from a voltaic battery. When the apparatus is in action, the gas  becomes luminous, and produces a white and continued light. The battery  and wire are carried in a leather bag, which the traveler fastens by a  strap to his shoulders. The lantern is in front, and enables the  benighted wanderer to see in the most profound obscurity. He may venture  without fear of explosion into the midst of the most inflammable gases,  and the lantern will burn beneath the deepest waters. H. D. Ruhmkorff,  an able and learned chemist, discovered the induction coil. In 1864 he  won the quinquennial French prize of L2,000 for this ingenious  application of electricity--A voltaic battery, so called from Volta, its  designer, is an apparatus consisting of a series of metal plates  arranged in pairs and subjected to the action of saline solutions for  producing currents of electricity.    Our arms consisted of two rifles, with two revolving six-shooters. Why  these arms were provided it was impossible for me to say. I had every  reason to believe that we had neither wild beasts nor savage natives to  fear. My uncle, on the other hand, was quite as devoted to his arsenal  as to his collection of instruments, and above all was very careful with  his provision of fulminating or gun cotton, warranted to keep in any  climate, and of which the expansive force was known to be greater than  that of ordinary gunpowder.    Our tools consisted of two pickaxes, two crowbars, a silken ladder,  three iron-shod Alpine poles, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges, some  pointed pieces of iron, and a quantity of strong rope. You may conceive  that the whole made a tolerable parcel, especially when I mention that  the ladder itself was three hundred feet long!    Then there came the important question of provisions. The hamper was not  very large but tolerably satisfactory, for I knew that in concentrated  essence of meat and biscuit there was enough to last six months. The  only liquid provided by my uncle was Schiedam. Of water, not a drop. We  had, however, an ample supply of gourds, and my uncle counted on finding  water, and enough to fill them, as soon as we commenced our downward  journey. My remarks as to the temperature, the quality, and even as to  the possibility of none being found, remained wholly without effect.    To make up the exact list of our traveling gear--for the guidance of  future travelers--add, that we carried a medicine and surgical chest  with all apparatus necessary for wounds, fractures and blows; lint,  scissors, lancets--in fact, a perfect collection of horrible looking  instruments; a number of vials containing ammonia, alcohol, ether,  Goulard water,"]]]
