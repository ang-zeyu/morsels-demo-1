Thankfully Rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep  the other in sight. The light points gathered, hung in a small  luminous cloud over the rocks. But Rynch had prudently withdrawn under  a bush, and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the  sparks, for no such crown came to his sentry post.    Drugged with fatigue, the younger man slept, awaking to full day, a  fog of bewilderment and disorientation. To open his eyes to this  blue-green pocket instead of to four dirty walls, was wrong.    Remembering, he started up and slunk down the slope, angry at his  failure. He found the other's track, not turning back as he had half  feared, cleanly printed on level spots of wet earth--eastward now.  What was the purpose of the other's expedition? Was he going to use  the open cut through which the river ran as a way of penetrating the  wooded country?    Now Rynch considered the problem from his own angle. The man from the  spacer had made no effort to conceal his trail, in fact it would  almost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot  prints on favorable stretches of ground. Did he guess that Rynch  lurked behind, was now leading him on for some purpose of his own? Or  were those traces left to guide another party from the camp?    To advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery. Rynch  surveyed the nearer bank. Clumps of small trees and high growing  bushes dotted that expanse, an ideal cover.    He was hardly out of sight of the bush which had sheltered him when he  heard the coughing roar of a water-cat. And the feline was attacking  an enemy, enraged to the pitch of vocal frenzy. Rynch ran a zigzag  course from one clump of bush to the next. That sound of snarling,  spitting hate ended in mid-cry as Rynch crawled to the river bank.    The man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three-prong  attack from a female and her cubs. Three red bodies were flat and  still on the gravel as the off-worlder leaned back against a rock  breathing heavily. As Rynch sighted him, he stooped to recover the  needler he had dropped, lurched away from the rock towards the water,  and so blundered straight into another Jumalan trap.    His unsteady foot advancing for another step came down on a slippery  surface, and he fell forward as his legs were engulfed in the trap  burrow of a strong-jaws. With a startled cry the man dropped the  needler again, clawed at the ground about him. Already he was buried  to his knees, then his mid-thighs, in the artificial quicksand. But he  had not lost his head and was jerking from side to side in an effort  to pull free.    Rynch got to his feet, walked with slow deliberation down to the  river's brink. The trapped prisoner had shied halfway around,  stretching out his arms to find a firmer grip on some rock large and  heavy enough to anchor him. After his first startled cry he had made  no sound, but now, as he sighted Rynch, his eyes widened and his lips  parted.    The box on his chest caught on a stone he had dragged to him in a  desperate try for support. There was a spitting of sparks and the  stranger worked frantically at the buckle of the webbing harness to  loosen it and toss the whole thing from him. The box struck one of the  dead water-cats, flashed as fur and flesh were singed.    Rynch watched dispassionately before he caught the needler, jerking it  away from the prisoner. The man eyed him steadily, and his expression  did not alter even when Rynch swung the off-world weapon to center its  sights on the late owner.    \"Suppose,\" Rynch's voice was rusty sounding in his own ears, \"we talk  now.\"    The man nodded. \"As you wish, Brodie.\"          6      \"Brodie?\" Rynch squatted on his heels.    Those gray eyes, so light in the other's deeply tanned face, narrowed  the smallest fraction, Rynch noted with an inner surge of triumph.    \"Were you looking for me?\" he added.    \"Yes.\"    \"Why?\"    \"We found an L-B--we wondered if there were survivors.\"    Slowly Rynch shook his head. \"No--you knew I was here. Because you  brought me!\" He fashioned his suspicions into one quick thrust.    This time there was not the slightest hint of self-betrayal from the  other.    \"You see,\" Rynch leaned forward, but still well out of reach from the  captive, \"I remember!\"    Now there was a faint flicker of answer in the man's eyes. He asked  quietly:    \"What do you remember, Brodie?\"    \"Enough to know that I am not Brodie. That I did not get here on the  L-B, did not build that camp.\"    He ran one hand over the stock of the needler. Whatever motive lay  behind this weird game into which he had been unwillingly introduced,  he was now sure that it was serious enough to be dangerous.    \"You have no cup this time.\"    \"So you do remember.\" The other accepted that calmly. \"All right. That  need not necessarily spoil our plans. You have nothing to return to on  Nahuatl--unless you _liked_ the Starfall.\" His voice was icy with  contempt. \"To play our roles will be for your advantage, too.\" He  paused, his gaze centering on Rynch with the intensity of one willing  the desired answer out of his inferior.    Nahuatl. Rynch caught at that. He had been on or in Nahuatl--a planet?  a city? If he could make this man believe he remembered everything  clearly, more than just the scattered patches that he did....    \"You had me planted here, then came back to hunt me. Why? What makes  Rynch Brodie so important?\"    \"Close to a billion credits!\" The man from the spacer leaned well back  in the hole, his arms spread flat out on either side to keep his body  from sinking deeper. \"A billion credits,\" he repeated softly.    Rynch laughed. \"You'll have to think of a better one than that,  fly-boy.\"    \"The stakes would have to be high, wouldn't they, for us to go to all  this staging? You've been conditioned, Brodie, illegally  brain-channeled!\"    To Rynch the words meant nothing. If they ever had, that was gone,  lost in the maze of other things which had been blotted out of his  mind by the Brodie past. But he would not give the other the advantage  of knowing his uncertainty.    \"You need a Brodie for a billion credits. But you don't have a Brodie  now!\"    To his surprise the prisoner in the earth trap laughed. \"I'll have a  Brodie when he's needed. Think about a good share of a billion  credits, boy, keep thinking of that hard.\"    \"I will.\"    \"Thoughts alone won't work it, you know.\" For the first time there was  a hint of some emotion in the man's voice.    \"You mean I need you? I don't think so. I've stopped being a plaque  for someone to play across the board.\" That expression brought another  momentary flash of hazy memory--a smoky, crowded room where men slid  counters back and forth across tables--not one of Brodie's edited  recalls, but his own.    Rynch stood up, started for the rise of the slope, but before he  topped that he glanced back. The damaged com box still smoked where  its wearer had flung it. Now the man was already straining forward  with both arms, trying to reach a rock just a finger space beyond.  Lucky for him the burrow was an old one, uninhabited. In time he  should be able to work his way out. Meanwhile there was the whole of a  wide countryside in which Rynch could discover a hideout--no one would  find him now against his will.    He tried, as he strode along, to piece together more of his memories  and the scanty information he had had from the Nahuatl man. So he had  been \"brain-channeled,\" given a set of false memories to fit a Rynch  Brodie whose presence on this world meant a billion credits for  someone. He could not believe that this was the spaceman's game alone,  for hadn't he spoken of \"we\"?    A billion credits! The sum was fantastic, the whole story  unbelievable.    There was a hot stab of pain on his instep. Rynch cried out, stamped  hard. One of the clawed scavengers was crushed. The man leaped back in  time to avoid another step into a swarming mass of them at work on  some unidentifiable carrion. Staring down at the welter of scaled,  segmented bodies and busy claws, he gasped.    Three dead water-cats were near the man trapped in the pit. Bait to  draw these voracious eaters straight to the prisoner. Rynch's empty  stomach heaved. He swung around, ran across the grassy verge of the  upper bank, hoping he was not too late.    As he half fell, half slid down to the water, he saw that the man had  managed to hook the webbing of the smouldering box to him, was casting  it out and dragging it back patiently, aiming at the nearest rock of  size, fruitlessly attempting to hitch its straps over the round of  stone.    Rynch dashed on, caught at that loop of webbing, and dug his heels  into the loose gravel as he began a steady pull. With his aid the  other crawled out, lay panting. Rynch grabbed the man's shoulder,  jerked him away from the body of the female water-cat. He was sure he  had seen a telltale scurrying around the smaller of the dead cubs.    The man straightened, glanced toward Rynch who was backing off, the  needler up and ready between them.    \"My turn to ask why?\"    Then his gaze followed Rynch's. The smallest cub twitched from side to  side. Not with any faint trace of life, but under the attack of the  scavengers. More scuttled towards the second cub.    \"Thanks!\" The stranger was on his feet. \"My name is Ras Hume. I don't  think I told you that when we last met.\"    \"This doesn't make any difference. I'm not your man, not Brodie!\"    Hume shrugged. \"You think about it, Brodie, think about it with care.  Come back to camp with me and--\"    \"No!\" Rynch interrupted. \"You go your way, I go mine from here on.\"    Again the other laughed. \"Not so simple as all that, boy. We've  started something which can't just be turned off as easily as you snap  down a switch.\" He took a step or two in Rynch's direction.    The younger man brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19092"],[0,"The Adventures of Paddy Beaver (#8)"],[1,"n.    That afternoon Old Man Coyote tried his new plan. He slipped into the  Green Forest, looking this way and that way to be sure that no one saw  him. Then very, very softly, he crept up through the Green Forest  towards the pond of Paddy the Beaver. As he drew near, he heard a crash,  and it made him smile. He knew what it meant. It meant that Paddy was at  work cutting down trees. With his stomach almost on the ground, he crept  forward little by little, little by little, taking the greatest care not  to rustle so much as a leaf. Presently he reached a place where he could  see the aspen-trees, and there sure enough was Paddy, sitting up on his  hind legs and hard at work cutting another tree.    Old Man Coyote lay down for a few minutes to watch. Then he wriggled  a little nearer. Slowly and carefully he drew his legs under him and  made ready for a rush. Paddy the Beaver was his at last! At just  that very minute a harsh scream rang out right over his head \"Thief!  thief! thief!\"    It was Sammy Jay, who had silently followed him all the way. Paddy the  Beaver didn't stop to even look around. He knew what that scream meant,  and he scrambled down his little path to the water as he never had  scrambled before. And as he dived with a great splash, Old Man Coyote  landed with a great jump on the very edge of the pond.          XIX    PADDY AND SAMMY JAY BECOME FRIENDS      Paddy the Beaver floated in his pond and grinned in the most provoking  way at Old Man Coyote, who had so nearly caught him. Old Man Coyote  fairly danced with anger on the bank. He had felt so sure of Paddy  that time that it was hard work to believe that Paddy had really gotten  away from him. He bared his long cruel teeth, and he looked very fierce  and ugly.    \"Come on in; the water's fine!\" called Paddy.    Now, of course, this wasn't a nice thing for Paddy to do, for it only  made Old Man Coyote all the angrier. You see, Paddy knew perfectly well  that he was absolutely safe, and he just couldn't resist the temptation  to say some unkind things. He had had to be on the watch for days lest  he should be caught, and so he hadn't been able to work quite so well as  he could have done with nothing to fear, and he still had a lot of  preparations to make for winter. So he told Old Man Coyote just what he  thought of him, and that he wasn't as smart as he thought he was or he  never would have left a footprint in the mud to give him away.    When Sammy Jay, who was listening and chuckling as he listened, heard  that, he flew down where he would be just out of reach of Old Man  Coyote, and then he just turned that tongue of his loose, and you know  that some people say that Sammy's tongue is hung in the middle and wags  at both ends. Of course, this isn't really so, but when he gets to  abusing people it seems as if it must be true. He called Old Man Coyote  every bad name he could think of. He called him a sneak, a thief, a  coward, a bully, and a lot of other things.    \"You said I had warned Paddy that you were trying to catch him and that  was why you failed to find him at work at night, and all the time you  had warned him yourself!\" screamed Sammy. \"I used to think that you were  smart, but I know better now. Paddy is twice as smart as you are.\"      \"Mr. Coyote is ever so sly;    Mr. Coyote is clever and spry;      If you believe all you hear.    Mr. Coyote is naught of the kind;    Mr. Coyote is stupid and blind;      He can't catch a flea on his ear.\"    Paddy the Beaver laughed till the tears came at Sammy's foolish verse,  but it made Old Man Coyote angrier than ever. He was angry with Paddy  for escaping from him, and he was angry with Sammy, terribly angry, and  the worst of it was he couldn't catch either one, for one was at home in  the water and the other was at home in the air and he couldn't follow in  either place. Finally he saw it was of no use to stay there to be  laughed at, so, muttering and grumbling, he started for the Green  Meadows.    As soon as he was out of sight Paddy turned to Sammy Jay.    \"Mr. Jay,\" said he, knowing how it pleased Sammy to be called mister,  \"Mr. Jay, you have done me a mighty good turn to-day, and I am not going  to forget it. You can call me what you please and scream at me all you  please, but you won't get any satisfaction out of it, because I simply  won't get angry. I will say to myself, 'Mr. Jay saved my life the other  day,' and then I won't mind your tongue.\"    Now this made Sammy feel very proud and very happy. You know it is very  seldom that he hears anything nice said of him. He flew down on the  stump of one of the trees Paddy had cut. \"Let's be friends,\" said he.    \"With all my heart!\" replied Paddy.    [Illustration]          XX    SAMMY JAY OFFERS TO HELP PADDY      Paddy sat looking thoughtfully at the aspen-trees he would have to cut  to complete his store of food for the winter. All those near the edge of  his pond had been cut. The others were scattered about some little  distance away. \"I don't know,\" said Paddy out loud. \"I don't know.\"    \"What don't you know?\" asked Sammy Jay, who, now that he and Paddy had  become friends, was very much interested in what Paddy was doing.    \"Why,\" replied Paddy, \"I don't know just how I am going to get those  trees. Now that Old Man Coyote is watching for me, it isn't safe for  me to go very far from my pond. I suppose I could dig a canal up to  some of the nearest trees and then float them down to the pond, but  it is hard to work and keep sharp watch for enemies at the same time.  I guess I'll have to be content with some of these alders growing  close to the water, but the bark of aspens is so much better that  I--I wish I could get them.\"    \"What's a canal?\" asked Sammy abruptly.    \"A canal? Why, a canal is a kind of ditch in which water can run,\"  replied Paddy.    Sammy nodded. \"I've seen Farmer Brown dig one over on the Green Meadows,  but it looked like a great deal of work. I didn't suppose that any one  else could do it. Do you really mean that you can dig a canal, Paddy?\"    \"Of course I mean it,\" replied Paddy, in a surprised tone of voice. \"I  have helped dig lots of canals. You ought to see some of them back where  I came from.\"    \"I'd like to,\" replied Sammy. \"I think it is perfectly wonderful. I  don't see how you do it.\"    \"It's easy enough when you know how,\" replied Paddy. \"If I dared to, I'd  show you.\"    Sammy had a sudden idea. It almost made him gasp. \"I tell you what, you  work and I'll keep watch!\" he cried. \"You know my eyes are very sharp.\"    \"Will you?\" cried Paddy eagerly. \"That would be perfectly splendid. You  have the sharpest eyes of any one whom I know, and I would feel  perfectly safe with you on watch. But I don't want to put you to all  that trouble, Mr. Jay.\"    \"Of course I will,\" replied Sammy, \"and it won't be any trouble at all.  I'll just love to do it.\" You see, it made Sammy feel very proud to have  Paddy say that he had such sharp eyes. \"When will you begin?\"    \"Right away, if you will just take a look around and see that it is  perfectly safe for me to come out on land.\"    Sammy didn't wait to hear more. He spread his beautiful blue wings and  started off over the Green Forest straight for the Green Meadows. Paddy  watched him go with a puzzled and disappointed air. \"That's funny,\"  thought he. \"I thought he really meant it, and now off he goes without  even saying good-by.\"    In a little while back came Sammy, all out of breath. \"It's all right,\"  he panted. \"You can go to work just as soon as you please.\"    Paddy looked more puzzled than ever. \"How do you know?\" he asked. \"I  haven't seen you looking around.\"    \"I did better than that,\" replied Sammy. \"If Old Man Coyote had been  hiding somewhere in the Green Forest, it might have taken me some time  to find him. But he isn't. You see, I flew straight over to his home in  the Green Meadows to see if he is there, and he is. He's taking a  sun-bath and looking as cross as two sticks. I don't think he'll be back  here this morning, but I'll keep a sharp watch while you work.\"    Paddy made Sammy a low bow. \"You certainly are smart, Mr. Jay,\" said  he. \"I wouldn't have thought of going over to Old Man Coyote's home to  see if he was there. I'll feel perfectly safe with you on guard. Now  I'll get to work.\"          XXI    PADDY AND SAMMY JAY WORK TOGETHER      Jerry Muskrat had been home at the Smiling Pool for several days. But  he couldn't stay there long. Oh, my, no! He just had to get back to see  what his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, was doing. So as soon as he was  sure that everything was all right at the Smiling Pool he hurried back  up the Laughing Brook to Paddy's pond, deep in the Green Forest. As soon  as he was in sight of it, he looked eagerly for Paddy. At first he  didn't see him. Then he stopped and gazed over at the place where Paddy  had been cutting aspen-trees for food. Something was going on there,  something queer. He couldn't make it out.    Just then Sammy Jay came flying over.    \"What's Paddy doing?\" Jerry asked.    Sammy Jay dropped down to the top of an alder-tree and fluffed out all  his feathers in a very important way. \"Oh,\" said he, \"Paddy and I are  building something!\"    \"You! Paddy and you! Ha, ha! Paddy and you building something!\"  Jerry laughed.    \"Yes, me!\" snapped Sammy angrily. \"That's what I said; Paddy and I are  building something.\"    Jerry had begun to swim across the pond by this time, and Sammy was  flying across. \"Why don't you tell the truth, Sammy, and say that Paddy  is building something and you are making him all the trouble you can?\"  called Jerry.    Sammy's eyes snapped angrily, and he darted down at Jerry's little brown  head. \"It isn't true!\" he shrieked. \"You ask Paddy if I'm not helping!\"    Jerry ducked under water to escape Sammy's sharp bill. When he came up  again, Sammy was over in the little grove of aspen-trees where Paddy was  at work. Then Jerry "]]]
