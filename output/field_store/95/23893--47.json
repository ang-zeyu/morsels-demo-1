[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#8)"],[1,"Sunday night, I was, in  the immediate later hours in especial--for it may be imagined whether I  slept--still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me.  I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word Mrs. Grose had kept  back. I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was not from a failure  of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems to me  indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow's sun was high I had  restlessly read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were  to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences. What they gave me  above all was just the sinister figure of the living man--the dead one  would keep awhile!--and of the months he had continuously passed at Bly,  which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The limit of this evil time  had arrived only when, on the dawn of a winter's morning, Peter Quint  was found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road  from the village: a catastrophe explained--superficially at least--by a  visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced--and  as, on the final evidence, HAD been--by a fatal slip, in the dark and  after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong  path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn  mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much--practically, in  the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but  there had been matters in his life--strange passages and perils, secret  disorders, vices more than suspected--that would have accounted for a  good deal more.    I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible  picture of my state of mind; but I was in these days literally able to  find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded  of me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and  difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen--oh, in  the right quarter!--that I could succeed where many another girl might  have failed. It was an immense help to me--I confess I rather applaud  myself as I look back!--that I saw my service so strongly and so simply.  I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the  most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had  suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one's own  committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united in  our danger. They had nothing but me, and I--well, I had THEM. It was  in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an  image richly material. I was a screen--I was to stand before them. The  more I saw, the less they would. I began to watch them in a stifled  suspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too  long, have turned to something like madness. What saved me, as I now  see, was that it turned to something else altogether. It didn't last as  suspense--it was superseded by horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes--from  the moment I really took hold.    This moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in the  grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles indoors,  on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to finish a  book, and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young  man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His  sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with  her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the  day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of  how, like her brother, she contrived--it was the charming thing in both  children--to let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany  me without appearing to surround. They were never importunate and yet  never listless. My attention to them all really went to seeing them  amuse themselves immensely without me: this was a spectacle they seemed  actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer. I walked  in a world of their invention--they had no occasion whatever to draw  upon mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some  remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that  was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly  distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion;  I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and  that Flora was playing very hard. We were on the edge of the lake, and,  as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof.    Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other  side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this  knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world--the  strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly  merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work--for I was something  or other that could sit--on the old stone bench which overlooked the  pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet  without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person.  The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but  it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There  was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction  I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what I should  see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising  my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to the stitching in which I  was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort not to move  them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able to make up my  mind what to do. There was an alien object in view--a figure whose right  of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect counting  over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was more  natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the  place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman's boy, from the  village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude  as I was conscious--still even without looking--of its having upon the  character and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than  that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were  not.    Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as  soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right  second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I  transferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment, was  about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the  wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I  held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden  innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited,  but nothing came; then, in the first place--and there is something  more dire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate--I was  determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from her had  previously dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that, also  within the minute, she had, in her play, turned her back to the water.  This was her attitude when I at last looked at her--looked with the  confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct personal  notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which happened to  have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea  of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make  the thing a boat. This second morsel, as I watched her, she was  very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place. My  apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some  seconds I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes--I  faced what I had to face.          VII      I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give  no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still  hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: \"They KNOW--it's  too monstrous: they know, they know!\"    \"And what on earth--?\" I felt her incredulity as she held me.    \"Why, all that WE know--and heaven knows what else besides!\" Then, as  she released me, I made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now with  full coherency even to myself. \"Two hours ago, in the garden\"--I could  scarce articulate--\"Flora SAW!\"    Mrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. \"She  has told you?\" she panted.    \"Not a word--that's the horror. She kept it to herself! The child of  eight, THAT child!\" Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of  it.    Mrs. Grose, of course, could only gape the wider. \"Then how do you  know?\"    \"I was there--I saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.\"    \"Do you mean aware of HIM?\"    \"No--of HER.\" I was conscious as I spoke that I looked prodigious  things, for I got the slow reflection of them in my companion's face.  \"Another person--this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror  and evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful--with such an air also,  and such a face!--on the other side of the lake. I was there with the  child--quiet for the hour; and in the midst of it she came.\"    \"Came how--from where?\"    \"From where they come from! She just appeared and stood there--but not  so near.\"    \"And without coming nearer?\"    \"Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as  you!\"    My friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. \"Was she someone  you've never seen?\"    \"Yes. But someone the child has. Someone YOU have.\" Then, to show how I  had thought it all out: \"My predecessor--the one who died.\"    \"Miss Jessel?\"    \"Miss Jessel.

Notwithstanding this there set in considerable emigration from the  Southern States followed by an agitation for the acquisition of Texas.  In 1827, therefore, Coahuila and Texas were organized as a State with  a law prohibiting slavery. As this, however, did not check the  immigration, President Guerro issued a decree[20] in 1829 abolishing  slavery in Mexico on the occasion of the celebration of the  independence of Mexico and in 1830 ordered a military occupation of  the State to enforce the anti-slavery measure.[4] But the aggressive  southerner ever endeavoring to extend the territory of slavery had all  but won the day in Texas. In 1836 Texas declared itself a republic  with a constitution permitting the introduction of slavery and  forbidding the residence of free Negroes without the consent of its  Congress. Then came the Mexican War resulting in the defeat of Mexico  and the cession to the United States of a vast territory of which  California was the most valuable part.    It is clear, therefore, that at the time the United States government  acquired the territory of California from Mexico, slavery had been  abolished there nearly twenty years. The pro-slavery party, however,  did not consider this action of Mexico a finality in the settlement of  the slavery question in the new possessions. When a bill providing for  the purchase of this territory was laid before the house, David  Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, after consultation with other northern  democrats, offered the following amendment:         \"Provided that an express and fundamental condition to the       acquisition of any territory from the republic of Mexico by the       United States, by virtue of any treaty which may be negotiated       between them, and to the use by the executive of the moneys       herein appropriated, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude       shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime       whereof the party shall first be duly convicted.\"[21]    This proviso was adopted by a vote of 83 to 64. The bill carrying this  proviso was then reported to the Senate where followed a heated debate  which lasted until adjournment, the proviso being killed in the midst  of stormy scenes in Congress.[22] This discussion showed that few  statesmen believed that slavery would be profitable in California.  They were not unlike Daniel Webster who, while speaking on the  admission of the State of Texas, said that slavery was effectually  excluded from California and New Mexico by a law even superior to that  which admits and sanctions it in Texas. He meant the law of nature.  The physiographic conditions of the country would forever exclude  African slavery there; and it needed not the application of a proviso.  If the question was then before the Senate he would not vote \"to add a  prohibition--to reaffirm an ordinance of nature, nor reenact the will  of God.\"[23]    The coming and going of the Negro in California did not especially  interest any one until the beginning of the immigration of the  forties. The subject of slavery in California was officially called to  the attention of the inhabitants through the issuance of a  proclamation by the Commander in Chief of the District in regard to  the unlawful enslaving of the Indians. He was endeavoring to protect  them, but they were enslaved[24] in spite of his efforts. The  legislature undertook to perpetuate this system by enacting a law  permitting the enslavement of Indians, the only condition upon the  master being a bond of a small sum, that he would not abuse or cruelly  treat the slaves. Under the provision of the same law, Indians could  be arrested as vagrants and sold to the highest bidder within  twenty-four hours after the arrest, and the buyer had the privilege of  the labor for a period not exceeding four months.[25] An Indian  arrested for a violation of a law could demand a jury trial, but could  not testify in his own behalf against a white person. If found guilty  of any crime, he could either be imprisoned or whipped, the whipping  not to exceed twenty-four lashes.[26]    Later there was a steady influx of southerners and their Negro slaves  into the territory of California, after the country was taken over by  the United States. Then came the question as to the enslavement of the  Negro. The situation became serious after the Congress of the United  States appropriated three millions of dollars for the purchase of the  new territory, and still more so after gold was discovered there.  Mexican rule ended with the cession of the territory to the United  States; and yet session after session of Congress adjourned without  giving California a territorial form of government. The question of  slavery in the newly acquired territory divided Congress so that they  could not decide the issue. Southern newspapers were advertising for  slave-owners to send names and the number of slaves they were taking  to California to found a _New Colony_.[27]    The settlers were divided. Some came because they either disliked  slavery, or were too poor to own slaves. They recognized the  possibilities for making California a free State and did not care to  be designated _Poor White Trash_ by masters who were being allowed to  fill the State with Negro slaves to constitute the basis of an  aristocracy like that in the South. There were other inhabitants in  California at the time who, being slave-owners, were southern  sympathizers. They were determined either to have slavery in  California or make a desperate effort before seeing the territory  given up as a free State.[28] It did not require very much  investigation, however, to show that the pro-slavery party was in the  minority. The editor of the _Californian_ said in May, 1848, that he  voiced the sentiments of the people in California in saying that  slavery was neither needed nor desired there. A correspondent of this  paper hoping to hold that section for free labor said: \"If white labor  is too high for agriculture, laborers on contract may be brought from  China.\" Referring to the proposal to make the commonwealth a slave  State Buckelew said: \"We have not heard one of our acquaintance in  this country advocate this measure and we are almost certain that  97-100 of the present population are opposed to it.\" Again it is  remarked in this paper: \"We left the slave states because we did not  like to bring up a family in a miserable, can't-help-one's-self  condition,\" and dearly as he loved the union, he would prefer  California independent to seeing her a slave State.[29]    The lack of law and order and fear of the southern slave-owners with  their herds of Negro slaves finally led to the call of the  Constitutional Convention. The question of slavery there was not so  much debated in that body as was expected. Some excited pro-slavery  leaders were talking of an independent _Pacific Republic_. The  southern faction in the convention was led by a Mr. Gwyn, who  afterwards became a United States Senator from California, and the  northern element was ably represented by a Mr. Broderick, who later  was chosen State Senator.[30] The convention finally drafted their  constitution with a section which provided that \"neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude unless for the punishment of crime shall ever be  tolerated in this state.\"    The pro-slavery faction in the convention was determined to have  slavery somewhere and had managed to have the eastern boundary of  California so designated that it extended as far as the Rocky  Mountains. This would have resulted in rejection by Congress, or a  division of the territory into a Northern and a Southern California,  giving the pro-slavery element a new State. The unwieldy boundary,  however, was discovered in time to have it changed, but not until  after much debate, which almost wrecked the constitution. The  California representatives elected by the convention left for  Washington, where they presented to Congress the constitution and the  petition of the California settlers asking for admission as a State.  There had never been a precedent for their act. Yet the settlers in  California felt perfectly justified, since it was their only safeguard  against the pro-slavery leaders who were bringing their slaves into  the territory.    Leaders at the national capital naturally hesitated, not knowing  whether or not the admission of California under the conditions thus  obtaining would aggravate or improve the national situation.  California, however, cared little about the national situation, as is  attested by the resolutions of 1850 to the effect: \"That any attempts  by congress to interfere with the institution of slavery in any of the  territories of the United States would create just grounds of alarm  in many of the States of the union; and that such interference is  unnecessary, inexpedient, and in violation of good faith; since, when  any such territory applies for admission into the union as a state,  the people thereof alone have the right, and should be left free and  unrestrained, to decide such question for themselves.\" Broderick moved  the insertion of the following: \"That opposition to the admission of a  state into the union with a constitution prohibiting slavery, on  account of such prohibition, is a policy wholly unjustifiable and  unstatesmanlike, and in violation of that spirit of concession and  compromise by which alone the federal constitution was adopted, and by  which alone it can be perpetuated.\" This amendment was adopted.[31]    After a debate of four months Congress admitted California as a free  State as one of five compromises. Jefferson Davis, however, repudiated  the idea of advantage to his section. He said: \"Where is the  concession to the South? Is it in the admission, as a "]]]
