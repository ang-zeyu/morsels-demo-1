Go on.\"    \"The clocks had chimed eleven when I gave up, and I felt physically  sick. The air by this time was poisonous, literally poisonous. I  dropped into the easy-chair and began to wonder what the end of it  would be. Then, in the shadowy parts of the room, outside the circle  of light cast by the lamp, I detected--darker patches. For awhile I  tried to believe that they were imaginary, but when I saw one move  along the bookcase, glide down its side, and come across the carpet,  towards me, I knew that they were not. Before heaven, sir\"--his voice  shook--\"either I am mad, or to-night my room was filled with things  that _crawled_! They were everywhere; on the floor, on the walls, even  on the ceiling above me! Where the light was I couldn't detect them,  but the shadows were alive, alive with things--the size of my two  hands; and in the growing stillness--\"    His voice had become husky. Dr. Cairn stood still, as a man of stone,  watching him.    \"In the stillness, very faintly, _they rustled_!\"    Silence fell. A car passed outside in Half-Moon Street; its throb died  away. A clock was chiming the half-hour after midnight. Dr. Cairn  spoke:    \"Anything else?\"    \"One other thing, sir. I was gripping the chair arms; I felt that I  had to grip something to prevent myself from slipping into madness. My  left hand--\" he glanced at it with a sort of repugnance--\"something  hairy--and indescribably loathsome--touched it; just brushed against  it. But it was too much. I'm ashamed to tell you, sir; I screamed,  screamed like any hysterical girl, and for the second time, ran! I ran  from my own rooms, grabbed a hat and coat; and left my dressing gown  on the floor!\"    He turned, leaning both elbows on the mantel-piece, and buried his  face in his hands.    \"Have another drink,\" said Dr. Cairn. \"You called on Antony Ferrara  to-day, didn't you? How did he receive you?\"    \"That brings me to something else I wanted to tell you,\" continued  Robert, squirting soda-water into his glass. \"Myra--goes there.\"    \"Where--to his chambers?\"    \"Yes.\"    Dr. Cairn began to pace the room again.    \"I am not surprised,\" he admitted; \"she has always been taught to  regard him in the light of a brother. But nevertheless we must put a  stop to it. How did you learn this?\"    Robert Cairn gave him an account of the morning's incidents,  describing Ferrara's chambers with a minute exactness which revealed  how deep, how indelible an impression their strangeness had made upon  his mind.    \"There is one thing,\" he concluded, \"against which I am always coming  up, I puzzled over it at Oxford, and others did, too; I came against  it to-day. Who _is_ Antony Ferrara? Where did Sir Michael find him?  What kind of woman bore such a son?\"    \"Stop boy!\" cried Dr. Cairn.    Robert started, looking at his father across the table.    \"You are already in danger, Rob. I won't disguise that fact from you.  Myra Duquesne is no relation of Ferrara's; therefore, since she  inherits half of Sir Michael's fortune, a certain course must have  suggested itself to Antony. You, patently, are an obstacle! That's  bad enough, boy; let us deal with it before we look for further  trouble.\"    \"He took up a blackened briar from the table and began to load it.    \"Regarding your next move,\" he continued slowly, \"there can be no  question. You must return to your chambers!\"    \"What!\"    \"There can be no question, Rob. A kind of attack has been made upon  you which only _you_ can repel. If you desert your chambers, it will  be repeated here. At present it is evidently localised. There are laws  governing these things; laws as immutable as any other laws in Nature.  One of them is this: the powers of darkness (to employ a conventional  and significant phrase) cannot triumph over the powers of Will. Below  the Godhead, Will is the supreme force of the Universe. _Resist_! You  _must_ resist, or you are lost!\"    \"What do you mean, sir?\"    \"I mean that destruction of mind, and of something more than mind,  threatens you. If you retreat you are lost. Go back to your rooms.  _Seek_ your foe; strive to haul him into the light and crush him! The  phenomena at your rooms belong to one of two varieties; at present it  seems impossible to classify them more closely. Both are dangerous,  though in different ways. I suspect, however, that a purely mental  effort will be sufficient to disperse these nauseous shadow-things.  Probably you will not be troubled again to-night, but whenever the  phenomena return, take off your coat to them! You require no better  companion than the one you had:--Mark Twain! Treat your visitors as  one might imagine he would have treated them; as a very poor joke! But  whenever it begins again, ring me up. Don't hesitate, whatever the  hour. I shall be at the hospital all day, but from seven onward I  shall be here and shall make a point of remaining. Give me a call when  you return, now, and if there is no earlier occasion, another in the  morning. Then rely upon my active co-operation throughout the  following night.\"    \"Active, sir?\"    \"I said active, Rob. The next repetition of these manifestations shall  be the last. Good-night. Remember, you have only to lift the receiver  to know that you are not alone in your fight.\"    Robert Cairn took a second cigar, lighted it, finished his whisky, and  squared his shoulders.    \"Good-night, sir,\" he said. \"I shan't run away a third time!\"    When the door had closed upon his exit, Dr. Cairn resumed his restless  pacing up and down the library. He had given Roman counsel, for he had  sent his son out to face, alone, a real and dreadful danger. Only thus  could he hope to save him, but nevertheless it had been hard. The next  fight would be a fight to the finish, for Robert had said, \"I shan't  run away a third time;\" and he was a man of his word.    As Dr. Cairn had declared, the manifestations belonged to one of two  varieties. According to the most ancient science in the world, the  science by which the Egyptians, and perhaps even earlier peoples,  ordered their lives, we share this, our plane of existence, with  certain other creatures, often called Elementals. Mercifully, these  fearsome entities are invisible to our normal sight, just as the finer  tones of music are inaudible to our normal powers of hearing.    Victims of delirium tremens, opium smokers, and other debauchees,  artificially open that finer, latent power of vision; and the horrors  which surround them are not imaginary but are Elementals attracted to  the victim by his peculiar excesses.    The crawling things, then, which reeked abominably might be Elementals  (so Dr. Cairn reasoned) superimposed upon Robert Cairn's consciousness  by a directing, malignant intelligence. On the other hand they might  be mere glamours--or thought-forms--thrust upon him by the same wizard  mind; emanations from an evil, powerful will.    His reflections were interrupted by the ringing of the 'phone bell. He  took up the receiver.    \"Hullo!\"    \"That you, sir? All's clear here, now. I'm turning in.\"    \"Right. Good-night, Rob. Ring me in the morning.\"    \"Good-night, sir.\"    Dr. Cairn refilled his charred briar, and, taking from a drawer in the  writing table a thick MS., sat down and began to study the  closely-written pages. The paper was in the cramped handwriting of the  late Sir Michael Ferrara, his travelling companion through many  strange adventures; and the sun had been flooding the library with  dimmed golden light for several hours, and a bustle below stairs  acclaiming an awakened household, ere the doctor's studies were  interrupted. Again, it was the 'phone bell. He rose, switched off the  reading-lamp, and lifted the instrument.    \"That you, Rob?\"    \"Yes, sir. All's well, thank God! Can I breakfast with you?\"    \"Certainly, my boy!\" Dr. Cairn glanced at his watch. \"Why, upon my  soul it's seven o'clock!\"          CHAPTER VI    THE BEETLES      Sixteen hours had elapsed and London's clocks were booming eleven that  night, when the uncanny drama entered upon its final stage. Once more  Dr. Cairn sat alone with Sir Michael's manuscript, but at frequent  intervals his glance would stray to the telephone at his elbow. He had  given orders to the effect that he was on no account to be disturbed  and that his car should be ready at the door from ten o'clock onward.    As the sound of the final strokes was dying away the expected summons  came. Dr. Cairn's jaw squared and his mouth was very grim, when he  recognised his son's voice over the wires.    \"Well, boy?\"    \"They're here, sir--now, while I'm speaking! I have been  fighting--fighting hard--for half an hour. The place smells like a  charnel-house and the--shapes are taking definite, horrible form! They  have ... _eyes_!\" His voice sounded harsh. \"Quite black the eyes are,  and they shine like beads! It's gradually wearing me down, although I  have myself in hand, so far. I mean I might crack up--at any moment.  Bah!--\"    His voice ceased.    \"Hullo!\" cried Dr. Cairn. \"Hullo, Rob!\"    \"It's all right, sir,\" came, all but inaudibly. \"The--things are all  around the edge of the light patch; they make a sort of rustling  noise. It is a tremendous, conscious _effort_ to keep them at bay.  While I was speaking, I somehow lost my grip of the situation.  One--crawled ... it fastened on my hand ... a hairy, many-limbed  horror.... Oh, my God! another is touching....\"    \"Rob! Rob! Keep your nerve, boy! Do you hear?\"    \"Yes--yes--\" faintly.    \"_Pray_, my boy--pray for strength, and it will come to you! You  _must_ hold out for another ten minutes. Ten minutes--do you  understand?\"    \"Yes! yes!--Merciful God!--if you can help me, do it, sir, or--\"    \"Hold out, boy! In _ten minutes_ you'll have won.\"    Dr. Cairn hung up the receiver, raced from the library, and grabbing a  cap from the rack in the hall, ran down the steps and bounded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1,"and remained a pigeon. The  eleven laughed at him and said:    \"Poor fellow, your bride betrayed you, didn't she? So you have to remain  shut up in your feather shirt while we go off and have a jolly time!\"    \"Yes,\" the Twelfth Pigeon said, \"she broke her promise and now she goes  wandering up and down the world hunting for me. If she doesn't find me I  shall nevermore escape the feather shirt but shall have to fly about  forever as a pigeon. But I know she will find me for she will never  stop until she does. And when she finds me, then the enchantment will be  broken forever and I can marry her!\"    The eleven youths went laughing arm in arm out of the house and in a few  moments the solitary Pigeon flew after them. Instantly the girl slipped  out from behind the door and hurried home with her pitcher of water.  Then she ran quickly across to the bath-house and all out of breath she  cried to the Princess:    \"O Princess, I have such a wonderful story to tell you all about a  rooster with wooden shoes and twelve pigeons only eleven of them are not  pigeons but handsome young men and the twelfth one has to stay in his  feather shirt because--\"    At mention of the enchanted pigeons, the Princess turned pale. She held  up her hand and made the girl pause until she had her breath, then she  questioned her until she knew the whole story.    \"It must be my love!\" the Princess thought to herself. \"Thank God I have  found him at last!\"    The next day at the same hour she went with the girl to the town well  and when the rooster clattered by in his wooden shoes they followed him  home and slipping into the house they hid behind the door and waited.  Presently twelve pigeons flew in. Eleven of them dipped in the milk and  came out handsome young men. The Twelfth sat disconsolately on the  window sill and remained a pigeon. The eleven laughed at him and twitted  him with having had a bride that had betrayed him. Then the eleven went  away laughing arm in arm. Before the Twelfth could fly after them, the  Princess ran out from behind the door and cried:    \"My dear one, I have found you at last!\"    The Pigeon flew into her hands and she took him and kissed his coral  beak and smoothed his gleaming plumage with her lips. Then she put him  in the milk and the feather shirt opened and her own true love stepped  out.    She led him at once to her father and when the King found him well  trained in all the arts a prince should know he accepted him as his  future son-in-law and presented him to the people.    So after all the Princess's mother was able to give her daughter the  gorgeous wedding she had planned for years and years. Preparations were  begun at once but the Queen insisted on making such vast quantities of  little round cakes and candied fruits and sweetmeats of all kinds that  it was three whole months before the wedding actually took place. By  that time the roses were again blooming in the Princess's cheeks, her  eyes were brighter than before, and her long shining hair was more  golden than ever.    All the neighboring kings were invited to the wedding and when they saw  the bride they shook their heads sadly and said among themselves:    \"Lost her looks indeed! What did people mean by saying such a thing?  Why, she's the most beautiful princess in the world! What a pity she  didn't marry one of our sons!\"    But when they met the Prince of her choice, they saw at once why the  Princess had fallen in love with him.    \"Any girl would!\" they said.    It was a big wedding, as I told you before, and the only guest present  who was not a king or a queen or a royal personage of some sort was the  poor girl who saw the rooster with wooden shoes in the first place. The  Queen, of course, had wanted only royalty but the Princess declared that  the poor girl was her dear friend and would have to be invited. So the  Queen, when she saw that the Princess was set on having her own way, had  the poor girl come to the palace before the wedding and decked her out  in rich clothes until people were sure that she was some strange  princess whom the bride had met on her travels.    \"My dear,\" whispered the Princess as they sat down beside each other at  the wedding feast, \"how beautiful you look!\"    \"But I'm not as beautiful as you!\" the girl said.    The Princess laughed.    \"Of course not! No one can be as beautiful as I am because I have the  secret of beauty!\"    \"Dear Princess,\" the poor girl begged, \"won't you tell me the secret of  beauty?\"    The Princess leaned over and whispered something in the poor girl's ear.    It was only one word:    \"Happiness!\"    [Illustration]          THE LITTLE LAME FOX      [Illustration]    _The Story of the Youngest Brother Who Found the Magic Grape-Vine and  Married the Golden Maiden_          THE LITTLE LAME FOX      There was once a wealthy farmer who had three sons. The oldest was a  selfish overbearing fellow. The second was a weak chap who always did  everything his brother suggested. The youngest whose name was Janko was  not as bright and clever as his brothers but he was honest and,  moreover, he had a good heart and in this world a good heart, you know,  is more likely to bring its owner happiness than wicked brains.    \"That booby!\" the oldest brother would say whenever he saw Janko. And  the second would snicker and repeat the ugly word, \"Booby!\"    The father was proud of his three sons and happy to see them grow up  strong and healthy.    \"They're good boys,\" he'd say to himself, \"and I'm a fortunate father.\"    Now there was one very curious thing about this farmer that nobody  understood. One of his eyes was always laughing and the other was always  weeping.    \"What's the matter with your father's eyes?\" people used to ask the  sons.    The sons didn't know any more than any one else. One day they were in  the garden discussing the matter among themselves.    \"Why don't we just go and ask him?\" Janko suggested.    \"If anybody is to ask him, I will!\" declared the oldest brother  importantly.    So he went indoors to his father and said:    \"Father, people are forever talking about your eyes. Now I wish you  would tell me why one of them is always laughing and the other always  weeping.\"    \"My eyes, indeed!\" cried the farmer, and in a rage he snatched up a  knife and hurled it straight at his son. The young man dodged aside and  fled and the knife stuck in the door jamb.    All out of breath the oldest brother returned to the others but of  course he was ashamed to tell them what had happened. So he said to  them:    \"If you want to know what's the matter with father's eyes, you'll have  to ask him yourselves.\"    So the second brother went in to the farmer and he had exactly the same  experience. When he came out he gave his older brother a wink and said  to Janko:    \"Now it is your turn, Booby. Father is waiting for you.\"    So Janko went in to his father and said:    \"You have told my brothers why one of your eyes is always laughing and  the other always weeping. Now please tell me for I, too, want to know.\"    In a rage the farmer snatched up the knife again and lifted his arm to  hurl it. But Janko stood perfectly still. Why should he turn and run  away as though he had done something wrong? He had only asked his father  a civil question and if his father did not wish to answer it, he could  tell him so.    The farmer when he saw that the boy was not to be frightened smiled and  laid the knife aside.    \"Thank God,\" he said, \"I have one son who is not a coward! I have been  waiting these many years to have my sons ask me this very question. My  right eye laughs because God has blessed me and made me rich and has  allowed my three sons to grow to manhood, strong and healthy. My left  eye weeps because I can never forget a Magic Grape-Vine which once grew  in my garden. It used to give me a bucket of wine every hour of the  twenty-four! One night a thief came and stole my Magic Vine and I have  never heard of it since. Do you wonder that my left eye weeps at the  memory of this wonderful Vine? Alas, the bucket of wine that used to  flow out of it every hour of the day and night--I have never tasted its  like since!\"    \"Father,\" Janko said, \"dry your weeping eye! I and my brothers will go  out into the world and find your Magic Grape-Vine wherever it is  hidden!\"    With that Janko ran out to his brothers and when they heard what he had  to say they laughed and called him, \"Booby!\" and asked him didn't he  suppose that they had already planned to do just this thing. Of course  they hadn't, but they were so jealous and ill-natured that they couldn't  bear the thought of his being the first to suggest anything.    \"We mustn't lose any more time,\" Janko said.    \"It doesn't matter how much time you lose, Mr. Booby! As for us we two  are going to start out to-morrow at sunrise.\"    \"But, brothers,\" Janko begged, \"please let me go, too!\"    \"No!\" they told him shortly. \"You can stay home and look after the  farm!\"    But their father when he heard the discussion said, no, Janko was also  to go as he was the bravest of them all. After that the brothers,  because they didn't want their father to tell how they had been afraid  and run away, had to agree.    So the next morning early the three of them started out, each with a  wallet well-stocked with food.    \"How are we going to get rid of the Booby?\" the second one whispered.    \"Trust me!\" the oldest one whispered back with a wink.    Presently they came to a crossroads where three roads branched. Now the  oldest brother knew that after a short distance two of the roads came  together again. So he motioned the second brother slyly that he was to  take the middle road. Then he said:    \"Brothers, let us part here and each take a different road. Do you  agree?\"    \"Yes,\" the other two said, \"we agree.\"    \"Then suppose Janko take the left-hand road.\"    \"And I'll take the middle road,\" the second cried.    \"And I,"]]]
