It is enough that I _have_ thought  of it, and can release you.\"    \"Have I ever sought release?\"    \"In words. No. Never.\"    \"In what, then?\"    \"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of  life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of  any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,\"  said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him, \"tell me,  would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"    He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of  himself. But he said, with a struggle, \"You think not.\"    \"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered. \"Heaven  knows! When _I_ have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and  irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,  yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless  girl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by  Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your  one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and  regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart,  for the love of him you once were.\"    He was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed.    \"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have  pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the  recollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it  happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have  chosen!\"    She left him, and they parted.    \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you  delight to torture me?\"    \"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.    \"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more! I don't wish to see it. Show me no  more!\"    But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him  to observe what happened next.    They were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or  handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful  young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,  until he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.  The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more  children there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;  and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty  children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting  itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but  no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed  heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to  mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most  ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I  never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all  the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and, for the  precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!  to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold  young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to  have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And  yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have  questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the  lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose  waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in  short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest  licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.    But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately  ensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne  towards it in the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time  to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with  Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and  the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him,  with chairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of  brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round the  neck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The  shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package  was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in  the act of putting a doll's frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than  suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden  platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and  gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough  that by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the parlour,  and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where they went  to bed, and so subsided.    And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of  the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her  and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such  another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have  called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his  life, his sight grew very dim indeed.    \"Belle,\" said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, \"I saw an  old friend of yours this afternoon.\"    \"Who was it?\"    \"Guess!\"    \"How can I? Tut, don't I know?\" she added in the same breath, laughing  as he laughed. \"Mr. Scrooge.\"    \"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut  up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His  partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.  Quite alone in the world, I do believe.\"    \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me from this place.\"    \"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\" said the  Ghost. \"That they are what they are, do not blame me!\"    \"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"I cannot bear it!\"    He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face  in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it  had shown him, wrestled with it.    \"Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer!\"    In the struggle--if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost,  with no visible resistance on its own part, was undisturbed by any  effort of its adversary--Scrooge observed that its light was burning  high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him,  he seized the extinguisher cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down  upon its head.    The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its  whole form; but, though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he  could not hide the light, which streamed from under it in an unbroken  flood upon the ground.    He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible  drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a  parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel  to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep.          STAVE THREE    THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS      Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in  bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told  that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was  restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial  purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger dispatched to  him through Jacob Marley's intervention. But, finding that he turned  uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this  new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own  hands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the  bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its  appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.    Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being  acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of  day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing  that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;  between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide  and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite  as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was  ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing  between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.    Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means  prepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and  no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five  minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.  All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze  of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the  hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen  ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;  and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an  interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the  consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you  or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the  predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would  unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that  the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining  room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea  taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in  his slippers to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#8)"],[1,"in that final measure.  One beat is borrowed for the  preliminary tone of the next phrase (that does not appear in our  example, but corresponds to the preliminary tone at the beginning); and  three beats are represented by rests, which cancel the resonance of the  melody-tone _g_, but do not actually negate the effect of the  cadence-chord.  In consequence of these two reductions, the time-value  of the _cadence-tone_ is diminished to two beats, and the whole cadence  assumes a lighter, less obstinate and stagnant character.  Of the six  beats belonging to the cadence-chord, four are occupied by the tones of  the accompaniment, which thus serves to bridge over the measure of  repose without destroying the impression of a cadence.    The treatment of the cadence is similar to this in Ex. 18.    In Ex. 17, No. 1, the cadence-chord falls, properly, upon the primary  accent (first beat) of the final measure--in this instance the fifth  measure, as we have learned.  The six beats to which it is entitled are  all occupied by the simple reiteration of the final melody tone, while  the sense of \"interruption\" is imparted by the long rest in the lower  parts.    It is by thus sustaining the rhythmic pulse, during the measure  allotted to the cadence-chord, that the desired dual impression,--that  of cadential interruption without actual cessation,--is secured.  It is  like rounding off a corner that might otherwise be too angular or  abrupt.          *      *      *      *      *      *    The question naturally arises: What tones are chosen to provide  material for this continuation of the rhythm?  They are usually derived  from the cadence-chord, or its auxiliary embellishments; and the  methods employed may be classified as follows:    (1) The rhythmic pulse is marked in the accompanying (subordinate)  parts, as seen in Ex. 15, Ex. 18, and the following:--    [Illustration: Example 20.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]    [Illustration: Example 20 continued.]      The point of repose is marked by the longer melody tone _f_, on the  accent of the fourth measure.  The value of the cadence-chord is  recorded, however, in the living tones of the accompanying figure,  which here (as in almost every similar case in composition) continues  its rhythmic movement undisturbed.    (2) The cadence-chord, or, more properly, the _cadence-tone_ in the  melody, is shifted to some later beat in the cadence measure.  Thus:    [Illustration: Example 21.  Fragment of Mozart.]      In this example there is in reality no irregularity, because the  cadence-tone rests upon an _accented beat_ (the fourth, in 6-8  measure), and the conditions of a cadence are fulfilled by _any_  accent, primary or secondary, of the final measure.  But it belongs,  nevertheless, to this class of disguised cadences; for whatever  results, thus, in abbreviating the value of the cadence-chord, lightens  the effect of the cadence, and serves the desirable purpose so  persistently pursued by all good writers.  Further:--    [Illustration: Example 22.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    [Illustration: Example 22 continued.  Fragments of Mendelssohn,  Schumann, and Mozart.]      Nos. 2 and 3 illustrate the method most commonly adopted in shifting  the cadence-tone forward to a later beat; namely, by placing an  embellishing tone (usually the upper or lower neighbor) of the  cadence-tone upon the accented beat belonging properly to the latter.  Nos. 4 and 5 are both extreme cases; the actual cadence-tone is shifted  to the very end of the measure, so that the effect of cadential  interruption is very vague and transient,--and will be quite lost  unless the player is intelligent enough to emphasize, slightly, the  phrasing (by making a distinct, though very brief, pause before  attacking the following measure).  See also Ex. 17, No. 2, the first  phrase; here, again, the melody runs on (through tones which embellish  the cadence-chord, _f-a-c_) to the last 8th-note of the fourth measure.    (3) A certain--entirely optional--number of tones are borrowed from the  value of the cadence-chord, as _preliminary tones_ of the following  phrase.  An illustration of this has already been seen in Ex. 14, No. 2  and No. 3.  It is the employment of such preliminary tones, that, as  thoroughly explained in Chapter III, creates a distinction between the  _melodic_ beginning and the actual vital starting point of the phrase;  or that gives the phrase an apparently shifted location in its measures.    Further (the actual cadence-tone is marked):--    [Illustration: Example 23.  Fragments of Beethoven and Mendelssohn.]    [Illustration: Example 23 continued.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]    No. 1 illustrates, again, the absence of preliminary tones in one  phrase, and their presence in the next.  In each of these examples  (excepting, perhaps, No. 2) the cadence is so thoroughly disguised that  there is little, if any, evidence left of the \"point of repose.\"  In  No. 4, particularly, the cadence-measure is rhythmically the most  active one in the phrase.  And yet the presence of a genuine cadence at  each of these places, marked *, is as certain and indisputable as in  Ex. 19.  The ear will accept a cadence upon the slightest evidence _in  the right place_,--where a cadence is expected.  See, also, Mozart  pianoforte sonata No. 10 (in D major), first 12 measures; measure 8 is  a _cadence-measure_.    Here follow a few more examples which illustrate the most extreme  application of this principle of borrowed tones,--a mode of treatment  very common in the music of Mozart, Haydn, and, in fact, all classic  writers:--    [Illustration: Example 24.  Fragments of Mozart.]    [Illustration: Example 24 continued.  Fragment of Beethoven.]      It is difficult to believe that in each of these cases the long array  of 16th-notes should not constitute the actual beginning of the phrase,  but are only preliminary; and yet this is the only correct view to take  of it, and it is the view which will simplify all analysis, when  thoroughly comprehended.  It must be seen that the cluster of  16th-notes in the cadence-measure (of the preceding phrase) is  _one-sixteenth short of a full measure_, and, therefore, it does not  represent the first measure of the next phrase, because our inviolable  rule is that the first measure of a phrase is its first _full_ measure.  The above examples emphasize the correct manner of counting the  measures; and they simply illustrate possible methods of _disguising  the cadence_.    In some cases it is difficult to determine whether the tones which thus  disturb the \"repose\" of the cadence-measure belong to the cadence-chord  (that is, to the _present_ phrase), or, as preliminary tones, to the  following phrase.  Upon careful scrutiny, however, it will be found  possible to decide, by examining their melodic bearing, to which phrase  they pertain.  In Example 22, they are manifestly (even in No. 5) a  part of the present phrase; in Example 23 and 24 they are as certainly  preliminary to the phrase which follows.  In the following example they  seem to constitute an entirely independent little \"interlude,\" without  direct reference to either phrase:    [Illustration: Example 25.  Fragment of Mozart.]          *      *      *      *      *      *    THE ELISION.--Finally, there are some (very rare) instances where the  composer appears to yield to the seductive influence of such extensive  preliminary groups as those seen in Example 24, and by setting aside  the trifling discrepancy, permits the apparent preliminary tones to  represent the _actual first measure of the next phrase_.  This is  easily accomplished, when, as in Example 24, No. 2, it is only one  16th-note short of a full measure.  And although this 16th, being the  cadence-chord, is actually equivalent to the whole measure, it is  sometimes less confusing to the hearer to silence it.  This is called  stifling the cadence (or Elision); and its presence depends simply upon  sufficient proof that what was supposed to be the cadence-measure (and  to a certain extent is such) is at the same time _really the first  measure of the next sentence_.  The following contains an illustration  of the elision of a cadence:    [Illustration: Example 26.  Fragment of Mozart.]    [Illustration: Example 26 continued.]      The proofs of this very singular and apparently untrustworthy analysis  are: (1) That there is absolutely no doubt about the first cadence,  marked *; (2) that a cadence is consequently due, and expected, four  measures later,--this proving the measure in question to be the  \"cadence-measure of the old phrase,\" as it is marked and as it appeals  to our sense of cadence; (3) that the last four measures unmistakably  represent a regular, compact phrase,--this proving that the  \"cadence-measure of the old phrase\" is unquestionably _at the same time  the first measure, or actual beginning, of the new phrase_.  In a word,  one measure is lost--not in effect, for the elements of the expected  cadence are all present,--but in the counting.  This lost measure is  the stifled cadence-measure, omitted by Elision.    Such cases are, as stated, very rare; so rare that the student will do  wisely to leave them quite out of his calculations.    In order to elucidate the embarrassing matter still more fully, we  shall take two more examples of a very misleading character, which the  superficial observer would probably define as elisions, but which are  almost certainly regular cases of disguised cadence merely:    [Illustration: Example 27.  Fragment of Mozart.]      Here again there is no doubt of the presence of a cadence at the first  *; but this \"cadence-measure\" appears almost as certainly to be at the  same time the initial measure of a new phrase.  This, however, proves  not to be the case, because _there are four measures left, without this  one_.  That is, counting backward from the final cadence, we locate the  \"first"]]]
