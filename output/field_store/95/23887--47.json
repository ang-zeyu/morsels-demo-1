He had hoped that to  leave the carcass in such a way would draw both animals back to the raft  when they were hungry. And they had not fed particularly well that day.    Thorvald? Well, the Survey officer had made it very plain during the  past five days of what Shann had come to look upon as an uneasy  partnership that he considered himself far abler to manage in the field,  while he had grave doubts of Shann's efficiency in the direction of  survival potential.    The Terran started along the pattern of retreat he had laid out to the  river bed. His heart pounded as he ran, not because of the physical  effort he was expending, but because again from the camp had come that  blood-freezing howl. A lighter line marked the lip of the cut in which  the stream was set, something he had not foreseen. He threw himself down  to crawl the last few feet, hugging the earth.    That very pale luminescence was easily accounted for by what lay below.  Shann licked his lips and tasted the sting of sap smeared on his face  during his struggle with the bushes. While the strip of meadow behind  him now had been spotted with light plants, the cut below showed an  almost solid line of them stringing willow-wise along the water's edge.  To go down at this point was simply to spotlight his presence for any  Throg on his trail. He could only continue along the upper bank, hoping  to finally find an end to the growth of luminescent vegetation below.    Shann was perhaps five yards from the point where he had come to the  river, when a commotion behind made him freeze and turn his head  cautiously. The camp was half hidden, and the fires there must be dying.  But a twisting, struggling mass was rolling across the meadow in his  general direction.    Thorvald fighting off an attack? The wolverines? Shann drew his legs  under him, ready to erupt into a counter-offensive. He hesitated  between drawing stunner or knife. In his brush with the injured Throg at  the wreck the stunner had had little impression on the enemy. And now he  wondered if his blade, though it was super-steel at its toughest, could  pierce any joint in the armored bodies of the aliens.    There was surely a fight in progress. The whole crazily weaving blot  collapsed and rolled down upon three bright light plants. Dull sheen of  Throg casing was revealed ... no sign of fur, or flesh, or clothing. Two  of the aliens battling? But why?    One of those figures got up stiffly, bent over the huddle still on the  ground, and pulled at something. The wooden shaft of Shann's spear was  wanly visible. And the form on the ground did not stir as that was  jerked loose. The Throg leader dead? Shann hoped so. He slid his knife  back into the sheath, tapped the hilt to make sure it was firmly in  place, and crawled on. The river, twisting here and there, was a  promising pool of dusky shadow ahead. The bank of willow-things was  coming to an end, and none too soon. For when he glanced back again he  saw another Throg run across the meadow, and he watched them lift their  fellow, carrying him back to camp.    The Throgs might seem indestructible, but he had put an end to one,  aided by luck and a very rough weapon. With that to bolster his  self-confidence to a higher notch, Shann dropped by cautious degrees  over the bank and down to the water's edge. When his boots splashed into  the oily flood he began to tramp downstream, feeling the pull of the  water, first ankle high and then about his calves. This early in the  season they did hot have to fear floods, and hereabouts the stream was  wide and shallow, save in mid-current at the center point.    Twice more he had to skirt patches of light plants, and once a young  tree stood bathed in radiance with a pinkish tinge instead of the usual  ghostly gray. Within the haze which tented the drooping branches,  flitted small glittering, flying things; and the scent of its half-open  buds was heavy on the air, neither pleasant nor unpleasant in Shann's  nostrils, merely different.    He dared to whistle, a soft call he hoped would carry along the cut  between the high banks. But, though he paused and listened until it  seemed that every cell in his thin body was occupied in that act, he  heard no answering call from the wolverines, nor any suggestion that  either the animals or Thorvald were headed in the direction of the raft.    What was he going to do if none of the others joined him downstream?  Thorvald had said not to linger there past daylight. Yet Shann knew that  unless he actually sighted a Throg patrol splashing after him he would  wait until he made sure of the others' fate. Both Taggi and Togi were as  important to him as the Survey officer. Perhaps more so, he told himself  now, because he understood them to a certain degree and found  companionship in their undemanding company which he could not claim from  the man.    Why _did_ Thorvald insist upon their going on to the seashore? To  Shann's mind his own first plan of holing up back in the eastern  mountains was better. Those heights had as many hiding places as the  fiord country. But Thorvald had suddenly become so set on this westward  trek that he had given in. As much as he inwardly rebelled when he took  them, he found himself obeying the older man's orders. It was only when  he was alone, as now, that he began to question both Thorvald's motives  and his authority.    Three sprigs of a light bush set in a triangle. Shann paused and then  climbed out on the bank, shaking the water from his boots as Taggi might  shake such drops from a furred limb. This was the sign they had set to  mark their rendezvous point, but....    Shann whirled, drawing his stunner. The raft was a dark blob on the  surface of the water some feet farther on. And now it was bobbing up and  down violently. That was not the result of any normal tug of current. He  heard an indignant squeal and relaxed with a little laugh. He need not  have worried about the wolverines; that bait had drawn them all right.  Both of them were now engaged in eating, though they had to conduct  their feast on the rather shaky foundation of the makeshift transport.    They paid no attention as he waded out, pulling at the anchor cord as he  went. The wind must have carried his familiar scent to them. As the  water climbed to his shoulders Shann put one hand on the outmost log of  the raft. One of the animals snarled a warning at being disturbed. Or  had that been at him?    Shann stood where he was, listening intently. Yes, there was a splashing  sound from upstream. Whoever followed his own recent trail was taking no  care to keep that pursuit a secret, and the pace of the newcomer was  fast enough to spell trouble.    Throgs? Tensely the Terran waited for some reaction from the wolverines.  He was sure that if the aliens had followed him, both animals would give  warning. Save when they had gone wild upon hearing that strange wail  from the camp, they avoided meeting the enemy.    But from all sounds the animals had not stopped feeding. So the other  was no beetle-head. On the other hand, why would Thorvald so advertise  his coming, unless the need for speed was greater than caution? Shann  drew taut the mooring cord, bringing out his knife to saw through that  tough length. A figure passed the three-sprig signal, ran onto the raft.    \"Lantee?\" The call came in a hoarse, demanding whisper.    \"Here.\"    \"Cut loose. We have to get out of here!\"    Thorvald flung himself forward, and together the men scrambled up on the  raft. The mangled carcass plunged into the water, dislodged by their  efforts. But before the wolverines could follow it, the mooring vine  snapped, and the river current took them. Feeling the raft sway and  begin to spin, the wolverines whined, crouched in the middle of what now  seemed a very frail craft.    Behind them, far away but too clear, sounded that eerie howling, topping  the sigh of the night wind.    \"I saw----\" Thorvald gasped, pausing as if to catch full lungfuls of air  to back his words, \"they have a 'hound!' That's what you hear.\"          5. PURSUIT      As the raft revolved slowly it also slipped downstream at a steadily  increasing pace, for the current had them in hold. The wolverines  pressed close to Shann until the musky scent of their fur, their animal  warmth, enveloped him. One growled deep in its throat, perhaps in answer  to that wind-borne wail.    \"Hound?\" Shann asked.    Beside him in the dark Thorvald was working loose one of the poles they  had readied to help control the raft's voyaging. The current carried  them along, but there was a need for those lengths of sapling to fend  them free from rocks and water-buried snags.    \"What hound?\" the younger man demanded more sharply when there came no  immediate answer.    \"The Throgs' tracker. But why did they import one?\" Thorvald's  puzzlement was plain in his tone. He added a moment later, with some of  his usual firmness, \"We may be in for bad trouble now. Use of a hound  means an attempt to take prisoners----\"    \"Then they do not know that we are here, as Terrans, I mean?\"    Thorvald seemed to be sorting out his thoughts when he replied to that.  \"They could have brought a hound here just on chance that they might  miss one of us in the initial mop-up. Or, if they believe we are  natives, they could want a specimen for study.\"    \"Wouldn't they just blast down Terrans on sight?\"    Shann saw the dark blot which was Thorvald's head shake in negation.    \"They might need a live Terran--badly and soon.\"    \"Why?\"    \"To operate the camp call beam.\"    Shann's momentary bewilderment vanished. He knew enough of Survey  procedure to guess the reason for such a move on the part of the aliens.    \"The settler transport?\"    \"Yes, the ship. She won't planet here without the proper signal. And the  Throgs can't give that. If they don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#8)"],[1,"very widely known. He only changed the name to Eight Colors  a few weeks ago. And it's for sure that your ship didn't get any  messages while the Lhari were in warp-drive. You mention entirely too  many names, but I notice you aren't giving out any further information.\"    \"I'm looking for a man called Rupert Steele.\"    \"I thought you were looking for Raynor Three,\" said Raynor One, staring  at the Mentorian cloak. \"I can think of a lot of people who might want  to know how I react to certain names, and find out if I know the wrong  people, if they are the wrong people. What makes you think I'd admit it  if I did?\"    Now, Bart thought, they had reached a deadlock. Somebody had to trust  somebody. This could go on all night--parry and riposte, question and  evasive answer, each of them throwing back the other's questions in a  verbal fencing-match. Raynor One wasn't giving away any information.  And, considering what was probably at stake, Bart didn't blame him much.    He flung the Mentorian cloak down on the table.    \"This got me out of trouble--the hard way,\" he said. \"I never wore one  before and I never intend to again. I want to find Rupert Steele because  he's my father!\"    \"Your father. And just how are you going to prove that exceptionally  interesting statement?\"    Without warning, Bart lost his temper.    \"I don't care whether I prove it or not! _You_ try proving something for  a change, why don't you? If you know Rupert Steele, I don't have to  prove who I am--just take a good look at me! Or so Briscoe told me--a  man who called himself Briscoe, anyway. He gave me papers to travel  under that name! I didn't ask for them, he shoved them into my hand.  _That_ Briscoe is dead.\" Bart struck his fist hard on the desk, bending  over Raynor One angrily.    \"He sent me to find a man named Raynor Three. But the only one I really  care about finding is my father. Now you know as much as I do, how about  giving _me_ some information for a change?\"    He ran out of breath and stood glaring down at Raynor One, fists  clenched. Raynor One got up and said, quick, savage and quiet, \"Did  anyone see you come here?\"    \"Only the girl downstairs.\"    \"How did you get through the Lhari? In that?\" He moved his head at the  Mentorian cloak.    Bart explained briefly, and Raynor One shook his head.    \"You were lucky,\" he said, \"you could have been blinded. You must have  inherited flash-accommodation from the Mentorian side--Rupert Steele  didn't have it. I'll tell you this much,\" he added, sitting down again.  \"In a manner of speaking, you're my boss. Eight Colors--it used to be  Alpha Transshipping--is what they call a middleman outfit. The  interplanet cargo lines transport from planet to planet within a  system--that's free competition--and the Lhari ships transport from star  to star--that's a monopoly all over the galaxy. The middleman outfits  arrange for orderly and businesslike liaison between the two. Rupert  Steele bought into this company, a long time ago, but he left it for me  to manage, until recently.\"    Raynor punched a button, said to the image of the glossy girl at the  desk, \"Violet, get Three for me. You may have to send a message to the  _Multiphase_.\"    He swung round to Bart again. \"You want a lot of explanations? Well,  you'll have to get 'em from somebody else. I don't know what this is all  about. I don't _want_ to know: I have to do business with the Lhari. The  less I know, the less I'm apt to say to the wrong people. But I promised  Three that if you turned up, or if anyone came and asked for the Eighth  Color, I'd send you to him. That's all.\"    He motioned Bart ungraciously to a seat, and shut his mouth firmly, as  if he had already said too much. Bart sat. After a while he heard the  elevator again; the panel slid open and Raynor Three came into the room.    It had to be Raynor Three; there was no one else he could have been. He  was as like Raynor One as Tweedledum to Tweedledee: tall, stern, ascetic  and grim. He wore the full uniform of a Mentorian on Lhari ships: the  white smock of a medic, the metallic blue cloak, the low silvery  sandals.    He said, \"What's doing, One? Violet--\" and then he caught sight of Bart.  His eyes narrowed and he drew a quick breath, his face twisting up into  apprehension and shock.    \"It must be Steele's boy,\" he said, and immediately Bart saw the  difference between the--were they brothers? For Raynor One's face,  controlled and stern, had not altered all during their interview, but  Raynor Three's smile was wry and kindly at once, and his voice was low  and gentle. \"He's the image of Rupert. Did he come in on his own name?  How'd he manage it?\"    \"No. He had David Briscoe's papers.\"    \"So the old man got through,\" said Raynor Three, with a low whistle.  \"But that's not safe. Quick, give them to me, Bart.\"    \"The Lhari have them.\"    Raynor One walked to the window and said in his deadpan voice, \"It's  useless. But get the kid out of here before they come looking for me.  Look.\"    He pointed. Below them, the streets were alive with uniformed Lhari and  Mentorians. Bart felt sick.    \"If they had the same efficiency with red tape that we humans have, he'd  never have made it this far.\"    Raynor Three actually smiled. \"But you can count on them for that much  inefficiency,\" he said, and his eyes twinkled for a moment at Bart.  \"That's how it was so easy to work the old double-shuffle trick on them.  They had Steele's description but not his name, so Briscoe took Steele's  papers and managed to slip through. Once they landed on Earth, they had  the Steele _names_, but by the time that cleared, you were outbound with  another set of papers. It may have confused them, because they knew  _David_ Briscoe was dead--and there was just a chance you were an  innocent bystander who could raise a real row if they pulled you in. Did  old Briscoe get away?\"    \"No,\" Bart said, harshly, \"he's dead.\"    Raynor Three's mobile face held shocked sadness. \"Two brave men,\" he  said softly, \"Edmund Briscoe the father, David Briscoe the son. Remember  the name, Bart, because I won't remember it.\"    \"Why not?\"    Raynor Three gave him a gold-glinting, enigmatic glance. \"I'm a  Mentorian, remember? I'm good at not remembering things. Just be glad I  remember Rupert Steele. If you'd been a few days later, I wouldn't have  remembered him, though I promised to wait for you.\"    Raynor One demanded, \"Get him _out_ of here, Three!\"    Raynor Three swung to Bart. \"Put that on again.\" He indicated the  Mentorian cloak. \"Pull the hood right up over your head. Now, if we meet  anyone, say a polite good afternoon in Lhari--you _can_ speak  Lhari?--and leave the rest of the talking to me.\"    Bart felt like cringing as they came out into the street full of Lhari;  but Raynor Three whispered, \"Attack is the best defense,\" and went up to  one of the Lhari. \"What's going on, _rieko mori_?\"    \"A passenger on the ship got away without going through Decontam. He may  spread disease, so of course we have alerted all authorities,\" the Lhari  said.    As the Lhari strode past, Raynor Three grimaced. \"Clever, that. Now the  whole planet will be hunting for any stranger, worrying themselves into  fits about some unauthorized germ. We'd better get you to a safe place.  My country house is a good way off, but I have a copter.\"    Bart demanded, as they climbed in, \"Are you taking me to my father?\"    \"Wait till we get to my place,\" Raynor Three said, taking the controls  and putting the machine in the air. \"Just lean back and enjoy the trip,  huh?\"    Bart relaxed against the cushions, but he still felt apprehensive. Where  was his father? If he was a fugitive from the Lhari, he might by now be  at the other end of the galaxy. But if his father couldn't travel on  Lhari ships, and if he had been here, the chances were that he was still  somewhere in the Procyon system.    They flew for a long time; across low hills, patchwork agricultural  districts, towns, and then for a long time over water. The copter had  automatic controls, but Raynor Three kept it on manual, and Bart  wondered if the Mentorian just didn't want to talk.    It began to descend, at last, toward a small green hill, bright in the  last gold rays on sunset. A small domelike pink bubble rose out of the  hill. Raynor Three set the copter neatly down on a platform that slid  shut after them, unfastened their seat belts and gave Bart a hand to  climb out.    He ushered him into a living room of glass and chrome, softly lighted,  but deserted and faintly dusty. Raynor pushed a switch; soft music came  on, and the carpets caressed his feet. He motioned Bart to a chair.    \"You're safe here, for a while,\" Raynor Three said, \"though how long,  nobody knows. But so far, I've been above suspicion.\"'    Bart leaned back; the chair was very comfortable, but the comfort could  not help him to relax.    \"Where is my father?\" he demanded.    Raynor Three stood looking down at him, his mobile face drawn and  strange. \"I guess I can't put it off any longer,\" he said softly. Then  he covered his face with his hands. From behind them hoarse words came,  choked with emotion.    \"Your father is dead, Bart. I--I killed him.\"          CHAPTER SIX      For a moment Bart stared, frozen, unable to move, his very ears refusing  the words he heard. Had this all been another cruel trick, then, a trap,  a betrayal? He rose and looked wildly around the room, as if the glass  walls were a cage closing in on him.    \"Murderer!\" he flung at Raynor, and took a step toward him, his clenched  fists coming up. He'd been shoved around too long, but here he had one  of them right in front of him, and for once he'd hit back! He'd start by  taking Raynor Three apart--in small pieces! \"You--you rotten murderer!\"    Raynor Three made no move to defend himself. \"Bart,\" he said  compassionately, \"sit down and listen to me. No, I'm no murderer. I--I  shouldn't"]]]
