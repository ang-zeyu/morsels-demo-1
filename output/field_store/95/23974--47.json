[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#8)"],[1,"published for children, the prevalence  of songs suited to the contralto voice is noticeable, indicating  apparently that the compass of infant voices at least is about the same  as that of the adult contralto. If there is any generally recognized  theory upon the subject, it would seem to be this; but from a  physiological standpoint the voices of children are totally unlike the  woman contralto, and especially is this true of children of from six to  eight years of age whose songs are usually written so low in range. An  error, started anywhere or at any time, of theory or of practice, if it  once become incorporated into the literature of a subject, is liable to  be frequently copied, and enjoy a long and useless life. So with this  treatment of the child-voice. The error is in supposing that it consists  of a limited number of quite low tones. It has its origin in the sole  use of the so-called chest-voice of the child, and when the evident  strain under which a child of six or seven years labors to sing up is  observed, the conclusion seems safe that they cannot sing high. While,  on the other hand, they manage with apparent ease to sing down even as  low as        [Music: a]    This conception has in divers ways so imbedded itself into the musical  literature for little children, that all efforts to uproot it have so  far been apparently futile. There are, however, very many supervisors of  school music, and the number is growing, who have recognized that this  treatment of little children's voices is a vocal barbarity, and the  device of pitching songs higher than they are written to overcome the  difficulty is more common than might be supposed. There can be no doubt  that in a short time the practice of carrying the tones of little  children three and four notes below the first line of the staff will not  be tolerated.    The common, even universal, tendency of primary classes to drop in pitch  when singing with the usual thick tone might show anyone that the voice  was being used in an abnormal manner. Furthermore, the intonation of  children of any age is something horrible when the thick voice is used.  Even carefully-selected and trained boy choristers, if they use this  voice, are frequently off the key even when supported by men's voices  and the organ. So in addition to other reasons for using the thin  register may be added this, that habits of faulty intonation are surely  fostered by the use of the thick voice.    Picture to yourself the short, thin, weak vocal bands of a child of six  or seven years attached to cartilaginous walls so devoid of rigidity  that in that dreaded disease of childhood-- croup-- they often collapse.  That is not an instrument for the production of tones in the contralto  compass. No wonder the pitch is wavering. If infant classes are to sing  with the usual tones, the common advice to make the singing-exercise  short is extremely judicious. It would be better to omit it.    The intimation that the last word can now be said on this subject is not  for a moment intended, but experience has given some tolerably safe  hints in reference to the compass of the child-voice in the thin  register at the ages mentioned, and it is advised never to carry the  compass lower than E first line, nor higher than F fifth line of the  staff, and the upper extreme must be sung sparingly. The easiest tones  lie from        [Music: f' d'']    The injunction to sing very softly need hardly be repeated.    Passing now to children who range in age from nine to eleven years, who  are found in the fourth and fifth years of school-life, it may be  observed that there is quite a marked increase in the evenness and  firmness of their tones. It is quite possible, especially at the age of  about eleven years, to extent the compass to G above the staff and to D  or C below; but if it does no harm, it serves no particular good end  either, and unless care is taken, the children will push the highest  tones. All of the necessary music drill can be kept within the suggested  range, and it is just as well to keep on the safe side. Then again, the  extremes in age between children of the same class grow farther apart as  we ascend in grade, and the compass must be kept within the vocal powers  of the youngest, and, from a voice-standpoint, weakest pupils. Protect  the voice, and nature will attend to its development.    From the time children pass the age of twelve years on to the period of  puberty, the child-voice is at its best, and if the use of the thin  register has been faithfully adhered to in the lower grades, the  singing-tone will now be both pure and brilliant. It will be found not  at all difficult to carry the same voice as low or lower than middle C  without any perceptible change in tone-quality, and G above the staff  will be sung with absolute ease. How much higher, if any, the compass  may be carried is open to discussion. It is not at all necessary in  school music to go any higher, for, even where it is deemed best to  raise the pitch of the song or exercise to avoid too low tones, the  pitch of the highest note will seldom be above G-- space above.    Still, it is the practice of choirmasters to carry the tone of soprano  boys much higher in vowel-practice, as high even as        [Music: c''']    and although that is a pretty altitudinous pitch, there are very few  choir-boys who, when taught to breathe properly, etc., will not take it  occasionally with perfect ease. The head-register, even in woman's  voice, is capable of great expansion, if good habits of tone-production  are followed. But again it is well to be on the safe side; and  choir-boys, who are selected because they have good vocal organs, and  who are drilled far more than school children, are hardly a criterion to  go by.    It must not be forgotten that the thin voice can be pushed and forced.  Good judgment must be exercised in controlling the power of voice, or  children will strain the vocal mechanism in trying to outsing each other  on _high_ tones.    The question, How high may boys or girls sing who have passed twelve  years of age and whose voices show no signs of break, is not so very  important after all, for if they have been well trained in soft tone, no  danger of vocal strain need be feared even if an occasional high A or B  flat is struck.    The reason for the ease with which children sing the high head-tones is  found in the structure of the vocal bands. They are _thin_.  Consequently, there is, compared to the entire substance of the vocal  bands, a larger portion proportionately set in vibration than for the  production of the head-tone in woman's voice. And when the child-voice  is so used that no strain of the laryngeal structure is occasioned, that  is, when the vocal ligaments are exercised in a normal manner, it cannot  but happen that the muscles controlling the vocal bands will increase in  strength, and that the bands themselves, composed as they are of  numberless elastic fibres, will improve in general tone and elasticity.    The suggestions made in regard to the compass of voice are, be it said,  simply suggestions based on experimental teaching and are such as it is  believed may be followed with safety in school singing. If they do not  square with the music of books and charts, why, as before said, it is a  very simple matter to give a higher key for any exercise, than the one  in which it is written. A supervisor, by marking the exercises in the  desk copy, can ensure the use of the key he desires. If it is objected  that the tones then sung will not represent the real pitch of the  written notes, why that is at once admitted. What then? The idea of  teaching absolute pitch is a chimera. Pianos are not alike in pitch,  neither are tuning-forks. Classes will often for one cause or another  end a half tone or a tone lower than they began even if the pitch as  written is given. It may not be desirable to sing in one key music that  is read in another, but it certainly is less objectionable in every way  than is an unsafe use of the voice. The correct use of the voice must  transcend all considerations in vocal music, and no sort of practice  which misuses the vocal organs can be excused for a moment.          CHAPTER V.    POSITION, BREATHING, ATTACK, TONE FORMATION.      One way to secure good position is to require the pupils to stand.  Unless the singing-period directly follows a recess, or the drill in  physical exercises, the pupils will welcome the opportunity. As soon as  standing becomes irksome resume the seats. No further direction in  regard to sitting position is necessary than that the body should be  held not stiffly, but easily erect and self-supporting, resting neither  upon the back of chair nor upon the desk in front. A doubled-up, cramped  position is, of course, all wrong, and may be avoided if the pupils are  permitted to alternate between sitting and standing positions; but, if  required to sit as suggested for too long a time, the rule will soon \"be  honored more in the breach than in the observance.\" This brings us to  the consideration of      _Breathing_,    for the latter in its relations to vocalization depends much upon  position. The breath is the motive power of the voice in speech or song,  and the fundamental importance of managing it aright has been understood  by every teacher of voice since the time of Porpora.    How for singing purposes breath shall be taken, how exhaled, how managed  in short, is not yet entirely settled and presumably never will be, for  people are not born wise, and some never acquire wisdom, of whom a few  teach music. Browne and Behnke, in \"Voice, Song, and Speech,\" p.  138-142, describe the process of breathing as follows:    \"There are three ways of carrying on the process of respiration, namely,  midriff breathing, rib-breathing, and collar-bone breathing. These three  ways are not wholly independent of one another."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#8)"],[1," the federal government power  to appoint governors of States and to veto state legislation. In the  notes of a speech presenting this plan, he disclaimed the belief that  it was \"attainable,\" but thought it \"a model which we ought to  approach as near as possible.\"[33] After the Madison plan had been  preferred, however, Hamilton gave it earnest support, and although he  could not cast New York's vote, since a majority of the State's  representatives had withdrawn, he was privileged to sign the  Constitution. If he had never done anything else, it was glory enough  to have subscribed his name to that immortal record. When Hamilton  returned home, however, he found himself discredited by a majority of  the people. \"You were not authorised by the State,\" said Governor  Clinton.[34] Richard Morris, the chief justice, remarked to him: \"You  will find yourself, I fear, in a hornet's nest.\"[35]    [Footnote 33: _Works_, Vol. 1, p. 357. G.T. Curtis, _Commentaries on  the Constitution_, pp. 371, 381, presents a very careful analysis of  Hamilton's plan. For fac-simile copy of Hamilton's plan, see  _Documentary History of the Constitution_ (a recent Government  publication), Vol. 3, p. 771.]    [Footnote 34: M.E. Lamb, _History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.  318.]    [Footnote 35: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 318.]    On September 28, 1787, Congress transmitted a draft of the  Constitution, which required the assent of nine of the thirteen  States, to the several legislatures. At once it became the sole topic  of discussion. In New York it was the occasion of riots, of mobs, and  of violent contests. It was called the \"triple-headed monster,\" and  declared to be \"as deep and wicked a conspiracy as ever was invented  in the darkest ages against the liberties of a free people.\" Its  opponents, numbering four-sevenths of the community--although their  strength was mainly in the country[36]--and calling themselves Federal  Republicans, organised a society and opened correspondence with  leading men in other States. \"All the old alarm about liberty was now  revived,\" says W.G. Sumner, \"and all the elements of anarchy and  repudiation which had been growing so strong for twenty years were  arrayed in hostility.\"[37] But its bitterest opponent in the thirteen  Colonies was George Clinton.[38] \"He preferred to remain the most  powerful citizen of New York, rather than occupy a subordinate place  under a national government in which his own State was not  foremost.\"[39] On the other hand, the _Federalist_, written largely by  Hamilton, carried conviction to the minds of thousands who had  previously doubted the wisdom of the plan. In the last number of the  series, he said: \"The system, though it may not be perfect in every  part, is upon the whole a good one, is the best that the present views  and circumstances will permit, and is such an one as promises every  species of security which a reasonable people can desire.\"[40]    [Footnote 36: W.G. Sumner, _Life of Hamilton_, p. 137.]    [Footnote 37: _Ibid._, p. 135.]    [Footnote 38: John Fiske, _Critical Period of American History_, p.  340.]    [Footnote 39: John Fiske, _Essays Historical and Literary_, Vol. 1, p.  118.]    [Footnote 40: _Works of Hamilton_, Vol. 9, p. 548.]    When the Legislature opened, Governor Clinton delivered the usual  speech or message, but he said nothing of what everybody else was  talking about. Consideration of the Constitution was the only  important business before that body; four States had already ratified  it, and three others had it under consideration; yet the Governor said  not a word. His idea was for New York to hold off and let the others  try it. Then, if the Union succeeded, although revenue difficulties  were expected to break it up immediately,[41] the State could come in.  Meantime, like Patrick Henry of Virginia, he proposed another general  convention, to be held as soon as possible, to consider amendments.  Thus matters drifted until January, 1788, when Egbert Benson, now a  member of the Legislature, offered a resolution for holding a state  convention to consider the federal document. Dilatory motions blocked  its way, and its friends began to despair of better things; but Benson  persisted, until, at last, after great bitterness, the resolution was  adopted.    [Footnote 41: W.G. Sumner, _Life of Hamilton_, p. 137.]    Of the sixty-one delegates to this convention, which assembled at the  courthouse in Poughkeepsie on June 17, two-thirds were opposed to the  Constitution.[42] The convention organised with Governor Clinton for  president. Among the champions of the Constitution appeared Hamilton,  Jay, Robert R. Livingston, Robert Morris, James Duane, then mayor of  New York, John Sloss Hobart, Richard Harrison, and others of like  character. Robert Yates, Samuel Jones, Melancthon Smith, and John  Lansing, Jr., led the fight against it. Beginning on June 19, the  discussion continued until July 28. Hamilton, his eloquence at its  best, so that at times there was not a dry eye in the assembly,[43]  especially emphasised the public debt. \"It is a fact that should  strike us with shame, that we are obliged to borrow money in order to  pay the interest of our debt. It is a fact that these debts are  accumulating every day by compound interest.\"[44] In the old  Confederation, he declared, the idea of liberty alone was considered,  but that another thing was equally important--\"I mean a principle of  strength and stability in the organisation of our government, and of  vigour in its operations.\"[45] Professor Sumner, in his admirable  biography, expresses surprise that nothing is said about debts in the  _Federalist_, and comparatively little about the Supreme Court. \"This  is very remarkable,\" he says, \"in view of the subsequent history; for  if there is any 'sleeping giant' in the Constitution, it has proved to  be the power of the Supreme Court to pass upon the constitutionality  of laws. It does not appear that Hamilton or anybody else foresaw that  this function of the Court would build upon the written constitution a  body of living constitutional law.\"[46]    [Footnote 42: _Ibid._, 137.]    [Footnote 43: M.E. Lamb, _History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.  320.]    [Footnote 44: _Hamilton's Works_, Vol. 1, p. 491.]    [Footnote 45: _Ibid._, p. 449.]    [Footnote 46: W.G. Sumner, _Life of Hamilton_, p. 139.]    Melancthon Smith was the ablest opponent of the Constitution. Familiar  with political history, and one of the ablest debaters in the country,  he proved himself no mean antagonist even for Hamilton. \"He must have  been a man of rare candour, too,\" says John Fiske, \"for after weeks of  debate he owned himself convinced.\"[47] Whatever could be said against  the Constitution, Smith voiced it; and there was apparent merit in  some of his objections. To a majority of the people, New York appeared  to be surrendering natural advantages in much larger measure than  other Commonwealths, while its concession of political power struck  them as not unlikely to endanger the personal liberty of the citizen  and the independence of the State. They disliked the idea of a far-off  government, with many officers drawing large salaries, administering  the army, the navy, and the diplomatic relations with nations of the  Old World. It was so different from anything experienced since their  separation from England, that they dreaded this centralised power;  and, to minimise it, they proposed several amendments, among them one  that no person should be eligible to the office of President for a  third term. Time has demonstrated the wisdom of some of these  suggestions; but commendable as they now appear after the lapse of  more than a century, they were of trifling importance compared to the  necessity for a closer, stronger union of the States in 1787.    [Footnote 47: John Fiske, _Essays Historical and Literary_, Vol. 1, p.  125.]    Federalists were much alarmed over the failure of New York to ratify.  Although the State ranked only fifth in population, commercially it  was the centre of the Union. From the standpoint of military  movements, too, it had been supremely important in the days of  Montcalm and Burgoyne, and it was felt that a Federal Union cut in  twain by the Mohawk and Hudson valleys must have a short life. \"For my  own part,\" said Hamilton, \"the more I can penetrate the views of the  anti-federal party in this State, the more I dread the consequences of  the non-adoption of the Constitution by any of the other States--the  more I fear eventual disunion and civil war.\"[48] His fear bred an  apparent willingness to agree to a conditional ratification,[49] until  Madison settled the question that there could be no such thing as  conditional ratification since constitutional secession would be  absurd. On July 11 Jay moved that \"the Constitution be ratified, and  that whatever amendments might be deemed expedient should be  recommended.\" This, however, did not satisfy the opposition, and the  discussion continued.    [Footnote 48: _Hamilton's Works_, Vol. 8, p. 187.]    [Footnote 49: _Ibid._, p. 191.]    Hamilton, however, did not rely upon argument alone. He arranged for  news of the Virginia and New Hampshire conventions, and while Clinton,  clinging to his demand for conditional ratification, still hesitated,  word came from New Hampshire, by a system of horse expresses, telling  the glad story that the requisite number of States had been secured.  This reduced the question to ratification or secession. A few days  later it was learned that Virginia had also joined the majority. The  support of Patrick Henry had been a tower of strength to Governor  Clinton, and his defeat exaggerated Clinton's fear that New York City  and the southern counties which favoured the Constitution might now  execute their threat to split off unless New York ratified. Then came  Melancthon Smith's change to the federalist side. This was"]]]
