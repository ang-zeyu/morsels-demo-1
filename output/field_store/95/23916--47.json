And the moment Dusty Moth saw what he was about he  gave a frightful scream--and flew off into the night.    \"He's a queer one!\" Freddie Firefly mused. \"Now, I've always thought  Betsy was a fine-looking----\" Just then his eyes fell upon the picture  for the first time. And Freddie Firefly's mouth fell open in  astonishment.    So amazed was he by what he saw that he tumbled right over backwards.  And then, scrambling to his feet, he wrapped the rhubarb leaf hastily  around the picture and slung it across his back again.    \"Jimmy Rabbit has made a terrible mistake!\" he groaned, as he started  for the duck pond.           *       *       *       *       *    Back at the meeting place once more, Freddie Firefly rushed up to Jimmy  Rabbit in great excitement.    \"Do you know what you did?\" he cried. \"You brought me the wrong picture.  And Dusty Moth has gone shrieking off into the darkness, he was so  disappointed. This is not Betsy Butterfly's picture! It's some  dreadful-looking caterpillar. And when I glanced at it just now, over  in the orchard, it sent a chill all through me.\"    For the time being Jimmy Rabbit said nothing. At first he had seemed  quite upset. But before Freddie had finished speaking he had begun to  smile. And then he unwrapped the picture once more and leaned it against  a stone, where the moon's rays fell squarely upon it.    \"You're mistaken,\" he informed Freddie then. \"This _is_ a picture of  Betsy Butterfly. I painted it myself; and I ought to know. As I  explained last night, I made it earlier in the summer; and as I said,  she has changed somewhat in the meantime. But it's a very good likeness  of her as she was once.\"    \"You mean--\" gasped Freddie Firefly--\"you mean that Betsy Butterfly was  once an ugly caterpillar?\"    \"Why, certainly!\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"And so was Dusty Moth, for that  matter. Yes! he was a caterpillar himself, once--and a much uglier one  than Betsy, if only he knew it.    \"In fact,\" said Jimmy, looking at the picture with his head on one side,  \"as caterpillars go, Betsy Butterfly was a great beauty, even at so  early an age.\"          XXII    THE SKIPPER      IN Farmer Green's meadow there lived a very nervous person called the  Skipper. He was a distant cousin of Betsy Butterfly's. And since the two  were almost exactly the same age, they quite naturally spent a good deal  of time together.    The Skipper was of a dark, somber brown shade. And it always seemed to  the gaily colored Betsy that he tried to make up for his dull appearance  by being extremely lively in his movements. He was forever skipping  suddenly from one place to another--a trick which had caused people to  call him by so odd a name.    Much as she liked this queer cousin, Betsy often found his uncertain  habit somewhat annoying. It was not very pleasant, when talking to him,  to discover that he had unexpectedly left her when she supposed he was  right beside her, or behind her. If she had anything important to tell  him she frequently had to hurry after him. And the worst of it was, once  she had overtaken him she never knew when he would dart away again.    As the summer lengthened it seemed to Betsy Butterfly that the Skipper  grew more flighty than ever. Once she had been able to say a few words  to him before he went swooping off. But now--now she could not even tell  him that it was a nice day without following her cousin at least half an  hour in order to finish her remark.    \"You're becoming terribly fidgety,\" Betsy told him at last. \"If you  don't look out you'll have nervous prostration--or I shall, if you don't  stop jumping about like a jack-in-the-box. I advise you,\" she said, \"to  see a doctor before you get any worse.\"    Of course, it must not be supposed that Betsy Butterfly could say all  that to her cousin without going to a good deal of trouble. As a matter  of fact, she had to follow him about the fields for two whole days and  travel several miles before she succeeded in finishing what she wanted  to say to him.    \"Why, I feel fine!\" the Skipper cried. \"I don't need a doctor. I----\"    He started to skip away from the wild morning-glory blossom on which he  had perched himself. But Betsy caught him just in time--and held him.    \"Now, you listen to me!\" she commanded. \"You're in a dangerous  condition. Some day someone will come to you with an important message.  And if you go sailing off the way you do, how's he ever going to tell  the whole message until it's too late, perhaps?\"    \"If it was good news it wouldn't hurt it to keep it a while,\" the  Skipper asserted cheerfully. And he gave a quick spring, with the hope  of escaping from Betsy's grasp. But she held him firmly by the  coat-tails.    \"Suppose I wanted to warn you not to go near the flower garden, because  Johnnie Green was waiting there for you with his net, to capture you and  put you in his collection? You might be sorry, afterwards, if you didn't  sit still and listen to me.\"    \"That's so!\" said the Skipper. \"I hadn't thought of that. I'd see a  doctor at once; but I don't know any.\"    \"Go to Aunt Polly Woodchuck, under the hill,\" Betsy Butterfly advised  him. \"She's the best doctor for miles around.\"    So they went, together, to call on Aunt Polly. The old lady looked at  the Skipper and shook her head. \"I can't help him,\" she said.    Betsy asked anxiously, \"Is his trouble catching?\"    \"No, indeed!\" said Aunt Polly. \"He can't stay in one place long enough  to give it to anybody.\"    Well, after that Betsy saw very little of her cousin the Skipper. But  she did not mind that, especially since she soon made the acquaintance  of a very agreeable young gentleman, who dressed in the height of  fashion. He wore a swallowtail coat every day. And the neighbors all  said that his manners were delightful.    _He_ never went skipping off while Betsy Butterfly was talking to him.

It was  through her manifesting a preference for me that, as I have told you,  Monsieur le Capitaine, I felt obliged to absent myself from her father's  employment.  It was most difficult at first to restrain myself from  talking.  But I soon got over that, for when I was about to speak I made  an uncertain sort of noise, which turned off suspicion.  That the head  labourer had some doubt about me, I verily believe.  I thought at first I  would try to get to London, but the roads thereto, I learnt, were so bad  and travelling so insecure, even for the poorest, that I considered it  best to remain in this neighbourhood, as I wanted to see Mademoiselle  P--- once more, and settle with her uncle for the money of mine in his  hands.  I thought if I could only communicate with him he would befriend  me, so I went on my way.    \"I travelled all that day until I got into a place called Warrington, by  the side of a river.  It is a town full of old quaint houses built of  timber and plaster.  I was very tired when I arrived there at nightfall,  but obtained shelter in an old house near the bridge, and as I had the  money my mistress gave me I bought some food at a little shop; a  Frenchman does not want very heavy meals, so that I did pretty well.  The  next day I went to a baker's and got some more bread.  I interested the  baker's wife, and when she found I was deaf and dumb, she not only would  not take money for her bread, but also gave me some meat and potatoes.  It seemed she had a relation affected as I was supposed to be.  I then  went out to a farm-yard, and having begged some straw I turned to my  never-failing fountain of help--basket making.  I made a number of  baskets and other little things, all of which on taking into the town I  sold readily.  I begged some more straw of a man at a stable, and set to  work again.  I sold off my baskets and fancy articles much quicker than I  could make them.  I soon got so well known that I excited some attention;  but one day being at a public tavern, where I had gone to deliver a  basket ordered, the word 'Liverpool' fell upon my ears and caused me to  tremble.  Near me sat two men who looked like drovers.  They were talking  about Liverpool affairs: one of them told the other that there had been  lately a great fire near the dock, where a quantity of provisions had  been burnt, and much property destroyed besides.  They then spoke of the  escape of my companions and myself, and for the first time I heard of  their fate, and how, one by one, they had been recaptured or willingly  returned.  I then heard of their trials and the miseries they had  encountered.  The drovers also spoke of one prisoner who had disappeared  and got away completely, but that there was a hot search after him, as  he, it was supposed, was the ringleader in the late outbreak, and that it  was planned and carried out by him.  I felt that they alluded to myself,  and that this place would grow too warm for me, as I knew that I was  already an object of public remark, owing to my supposed infirmities and  the extraordinary dexterity of my fingers.  It will be recollected that I  bought some bread at a little shop near the market-place.  Passing there  the day after I arrived, I saw a bill in the window bearing the words  \"_lodgings to let_.\"  I, therefore, by signs made the woman of the shop  comprehend that I wanted such accommodation.  I took the bill out of the  window, pointed to the words, and the to myself; then I laid my hand on  my head as if in the attitude of sleep.  The good woman quite  comprehended me, and nodding her head to my dumb proposition led the way  up a small flight of stairs, and at once installed me in the vacant room.  It was small and poorly furnished, but very clean.  I soon made myself at  home; and never wanted anything doing for me, so that the widow's  intercourse with me was very limited.  I knew I could not write without  betraying my foreign origin, so the way I did first was to get a book and  pick out words signifying what I wanted, and from these words the good  woman made out a sentence.  I wanted so little that we had no difficulty  in making out a dialogue.  After hearing the talk of the drovers I  determined to leave the town without delay, for my fears of recapture  quite unmanned me, making me needlessly dread any intercourse with  strangers.  Having thus resolved to leave Warrington I bade goodbye to my  kind landlady, giving her a trifle over her demand, and then shaped my  way to the northward.  I went to several towns, large and small, and  stayed in Manchester a week, where I sold what I made very readily.  My  supposed infirmities excited general commiseration everywhere, and  numerous little acts of kindness did I receive.  I wandered about the  neighbouring towns in the vicinity for a long time, being loth to leave  it for several reasons; in fact I quite established a connection amongst  the farmers and gentry, who employed me in fabricating little articles of  fancy work and repairing all sorts of things most diverse in their  natures and uses.  At one farm-house I mended a tea-pot and a  ploughshare, and at a gentleman's house, near St. Helen's, repaired a  cart, and almost re-built a boat, which was used on his fish-pond.  I  turned my hand to any and everything.  I do not say I did everything  well, but I did it satisfactorily to those who employed me.  I now began  to be troubled about my money which was accumulating, being obliged to  carry it about with me, as I feared being pillaged of it.  I therefore  resolved on coming back to Liverpool and finding out Monsieur P--- at all  hazards, trusting to chance that I should not be recognised.  Who could  do so?  Who would know me in the town save the Tower gaolers who would  scarcely be out at night; even they would not recollect me in the dark  streets of the town?  When this resolve came upon me I was at a place  called Upholland where I had been living three or four days, repairing  some weaver's looms--for there are a good many weavers in that little  town.  I had nearly finished the work I had undertaken, and was intending  to come to Liverpool direct at the end of the following week, when my  design was frustrated by a curious and most unexpected circumstance.  About three miles from Upholland there is a very high hill called  Ashurst.  On the top of this is a beacon tower which looks at a distance  like a church steeple rising over the top of the hill, just as if the  body of the church were on the other side of the crest.  This beacon is  intended to communicate alarm to the neighbouring country in war time, it  being one of a line of beacons to and from different places.  I had once  or twice walked to this high place to enjoy the fine prospect.  On Sunday  last I had gone there and extended my walk down the hill to a place where  the road, after passing a pretty old entrance-gateway, moat, and old  hall, dips very prettily down to bridge over a small stream.  This bridge  (Cobb's Brow Bridge) is covered with ivy, and is very picturesque.  Just  before the road rather abruptly descends there are, on the right hand  side of it, a number of remarkably old and noble oak trees, quite giants.  Some are hollowed out, and one is so large that it will accommodate  several persons.  This tree has been used by what you call gipsies--and  shows that fire has been made in it.    \"Well, on Sunday, in the afternoon, I was sitting under one of these fine  old trees, when I saw a cavalcade coming down the road, consisting of two  ladies and a gentleman mounted on fine horses, and attended by two  serving-men or grooms.  When the party had arrived opposite the trees  they stopped to examine them, when one of the ladies, struck with the  wonderful size of the largest tree, expressed her admiration of it in  very purely-pronounced French.  I was so surprised that I became  completely unnerved, was thrown off my guard, and, in the excitement of  the moment, at hearing my native tongue so beautifully pronounced, sprang  up, and rushing forward echoed in my own tongue the lady's commendation  of those grand old trees.  I immediately found out my error, for, to my  grief, the other young lady, whom I at once recognized, exclaimed--\"Why  this is the dumb man who was at the Hall the other day repairing the  broken glass vases!\"  I at first denied that such was the case, but on  the grooms coming up they both identified me.  In fact, I knew both from  having applied to the younger of the two, only a few days previously, to  obtain for me employment in the house of his master, in any way my  services could be made available.  Thus I had through him obtained  permission to repair the vases which had been much injured, and which I  had most successfully put in order.  The gentleman then asked me who I  was, called me an impostor, and ordered his servants to seize me.  This  they did, when I at once admitted who I was and where I came from.  The  gentleman, although entreated most earnestly by the ladies to allow me to  go away, would not consent to his servants releasing me, but ordered them  to take me to Ormschurch (Ormskirk), about five miles distant, and have  me put into the little prison there, which you call the cage.  The  ladies, with tears in their eyes, on seeing me thus seized by the  servant-men, bade them not use me roughly, and one of them slipped a gold  piece into my hand, bidding me in French to be of good cheer, for there  was a talk of immediate peace, when I should be released.  The gentleman  rode away calling the young ladies to follow him without delay, bidding,  at the same time, the servants to see that I was delivered over to the  proper authorities at Ormschurch, so that I might be transmitted to  Liverpool.  As soon as the master and the ladies were out of sight,"]]]
