This hybrid  image of decay, conjured up out of emptiness, contradiction and vain  imagining, in which all the instincts of _decadence_, all the cowardices  and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!--      20.    In my condemnation of Christianity I surely hope I do no injustice to a  related religion with an even larger number of believers: I allude to  _Buddhism_. Both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religions--they  are both _decadence_ religions--but they are separated from each other  in a very remarkable way. For the fact that he is able to _compare_ them  at all the critic of Christianity is indebted to the scholars of  India.--Buddhism is a hundred times as realistic as Christianity--it is  part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively  and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of philosophical  speculation. The concept, \"god,\" was already disposed of before it  appeared. Buddhism is the only genuinely _positive_ religion to be  encountered in history, and this applies even to its epistemology (which  is a strict phenomenalism). It does not speak of a \"struggle with sin,\"  but, yielding to reality, of the \"struggle with suffering.\" Sharply  differentiating itself from Christianity, it puts the self-deception  that lies in moral concepts behind it; it is, in my phrase, _beyond_  good and evil.--The two physiological facts upon which it grounds itself  and upon which it bestows its chief attention are: first, an excessive  sensitiveness to sensation, which manifests itself as a refined  susceptibility to pain, and _secondly_, an extraordinary spirituality, a  too protracted concern with concepts and logical procedures, under the  influence of which the instinct of personality has yielded to a notion  of the \"impersonal.\" (--Both of these states will be familiar to a few  of my readers, the objectivists, by experience, as they are to me).  These physiological states produced a _depression_, and Buddha tried to  combat it by hygienic measures. Against it he prescribed a life in the  open, a life of travel; moderation in eating and a careful selection of  foods; caution in the use of intoxicants; the same caution in arousing  any of the passions that foster a bilious habit and heat the blood;  finally, no _worry_, either on one's own account or on account of  others. He encourages ideas that make for either quiet contentment or  good cheer--he finds means to combat ideas of other sorts. He  understands good, the state of goodness, as something which promotes  health. _Prayer_ is not included, and neither is _asceticism_. There is  no categorical imperative nor any disciplines, even within the walls of  a monastery (--it is always possible to leave--). These things would  have been simply means of increasing the excessive sensitiveness above  mentioned. For the same reason he does not advocate any conflict with  unbelievers; his teaching is antagonistic to nothing so much as to  revenge, aversion, _ressentiment_ (--\"enmity never brings an end to  enmity\": the moving refrain of all Buddhism....) And in all this he was  right, for it is precisely these passions which, in view of his main  regiminal purpose, are _unhealthful_. The mental fatigue that he  observes, already plainly displayed in too much \"objectivity\" (that is,  in the individual's loss of interest in himself, in loss of balance and  of \"egoism\"), he combats by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual  interests back to the _ego_. In Buddha's teaching egoism is a duty. The  \"one thing needful,\" the question \"how can you be delivered from  suffering,\" regulates and determines the whole spiritual diet.  (--Perhaps one will here recall that Athenian who also declared war upon  pure \"scientificality,\" to wit, Socrates, who also elevated egoism to  the estate of a morality).      21.    The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of  great gentleness and liberality, and _no_ militarism; moreover, it must  get its start among the higher and better educated classes.  Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata,  and they are _attained_. Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection  is merely an object of aspiration: perfection is actually normal.--    Under Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed  come to the fore: it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their  salvation in it. Here the prevailing pastime, the favourite remedy for  boredom is the discussion of sin, self-criticism, the inquisition of  conscience; here the emotion produced by _power_ (called \"God\") is  pumped up (by prayer); here the highest good is regarded as  unattainable, as a gift, as \"grace.\" Here, too, open dealing is lacking;  concealment and the darkened room are Christian. Here body is despised  and hygiene is denounced as sensual; the church even ranges itself  against cleanliness (--the first Christian order after the banishment of  the Moors closed the public baths, of which there were 270 in Cordova  alone). Christian, too, is a certain cruelty toward one's self and  toward others; hatred of unbelievers; the will to persecute. Sombre and  disquieting ideas are in the foreground; the most esteemed states of  mind, bearing the most respectable names, are epileptoid; the diet is so  regulated as to engender morbid symptoms and over-stimulate the nerves.  Christian, again, is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth, to  the \"aristocratic\"--along with a sort of secret rivalry with them (--one  resigns one's \"body\" to them; one wants _only_ one's \"soul\"...). And  Christian is all hatred of the intellect, of pride, of courage, of  freedom, of intellectual _libertinage_; Christian is all hatred of the  senses, of joy in the senses, of joy in general....      22.    When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest  orders, the _underworld_ of the ancient world, and began seeking power  among barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with _exhausted_ men,  but with men still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture--in  brief, strong men, but bungled men. Here, unlike in the case of the  Buddhists, the cause of discontent with self, suffering through self, is  _not_ merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on  the contrary, an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others, a  tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas.  Christianity had to embrace _barbaric_ concepts and valuations in order  to obtain mastery over barbarians: of such sort, for example, are the  sacrifices of the first-born, the drinking of blood as a sacrament, the  disdain of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its forms,  whether bodily or not; the whole pomp of the cult. Buddhism is a  religion for peoples in a further state of development, for races that  have become kind, gentle and over-spiritualized (--Europe is not yet  ripe for it--): it is a summons that takes them back to peace and  cheerfulness, to a careful rationing of the spirit, to a certain  hardening of the body. Christianity aims at mastering _beasts of prey_;  its modus operandi is to make them _ill_--to make feeble is the  Christian recipe for taming, for \"_civilizing_.\" Buddhism is a religion  for the closing, over-wearied stages of civilization. Christianity  appears before civilization has so much as begun--under certain  circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof.      23.    Buddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times more austere, more honest, more  objective. It no longer has to _justify_ its pains, its susceptibility  to suffering, by interpreting these things in terms of sin--it simply  says, as it simply thinks, \"I suffer.\" To the barbarian, however,  suffering in itself is scarcely understandable: what he needs, first of  all, is an explanation as to _why_ he suffers. (His mere instinct  prompts him to deny his suffering altogether, or to endure it in  silence.) Here the word \"devil\" was a blessing: man had to have an  omnipotent and terrible enemy--there was no need to be ashamed of  suffering at the hands of such an enemy.--    At the bottom of Christianity there are several subtleties that belong  to the Orient. In the first place, it knows that it is of very little  consequence whether a thing be true or not, so long as it is _believed_  to be true. Truth and _faith_: here we have two wholly distinct worlds  of ideas, almost two diametrically _opposite_ worlds--the road to the  one and the road to the other lie miles apart. To understand that fact  thoroughly--this is almost enough, in the Orient, to _make_ one a sage.  The Brahmins knew it, Plato knew it, every student of the esoteric knows  it. When, for example, a man gets any _pleasure_ out of the notion that  he has been saved from sin, it is _not_ necessary for him to be actually  sinful, but merely to _feel_ sinful. But when _faith_ is thus exalted  above everything else, it necessarily follows that reason, knowledge and  patient inquiry have to be discredited: the road to the truth becomes a  forbidden road.--Hope, in its stronger forms, is a great deal more  powerful _stimulans_ to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be.  Man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict  with actuality can dash it--so high, indeed, that no fulfilment can  _satisfy_ it: a hope reaching out beyond this world. (Precisely because  of this power that hope has of making the suffering hold out, the Greeks  regarded it as the evil of evils, as the most _malign_ of evils; it  remained behind at the source of all evil.)[3]--In order that _love_ may  be possible, God must become a person; in order that the lower instincts  may take a hand in the matter God must be young. To satisfy the ardor of  the woman a beautiful saint must appear "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#8)"],[1,"day. The masks  which had been sung and prayed over all night were laid away in the niche  behind the song-priest. The little girl who performed the previous night  returned to the lodge, but I could not see that she was there for any  purpose save to eat some of the remaining food, which had been gathered  into two large parcels and left by the old woman who removed the vessels  after the feast. A red blanket was laid and upon it a piece of white  cotton. A reed five inches in length and twice the diameter of the others  heretofore used was prepared. The reed was colored black in the usual  manner and filled with a feather ball and tobacco. It was lighted with the  crystal and touched with the pollen. Upon the completion of the tube the  invalid took his seat on the west side of the rug, the attendant who  prepared the tube sitting on the west side; he took from one pouch four  white shell beads and from another a turquoise bead; he looped a cord of  white cotton yarn some three feet long around the pollen end of the tube  and fastened to the loop two wing feathers of the Arctic blue bird, one  from the right wing and one from the left, and a tail feather from the  same bird and three feathers from a bird of yellow plumage, the right and  left wing and tail feather. The five beads were strung on the string, the  turquoise being the first put on; these were slipped up the cord and two  under tail-feathers and a hair from the beard of the turkey were fastened  to the end of the string with a loop similar to that which attached it to  the tube. (See PL CXIX.). This was the great (cigarette) offering to  Hasjelti and must be placed in a canyon near a spring, for all birds  gather at the waters. This was offered that the song-priest might have his  prayers passed straight over the line of song. This offering secures the  presence of this most valued god and so fills the mind of the song-priest  with song and prayer that it comes forth without hesitation and without  thought, so that he may never have to think for his words. A small  quantity of each variety of sand used in decorating was placed on a husk  with a little tobacco, and on these a pinch of corn pollen; the tube was  then laid on the husk and the string and feathers carefully placed. Two  additional feathers, the under tail of the eagle and turkey, were laid on  the husk. A blue feather was dipped in water, then in pollen, and rubbed  twice over these feathers; an attendant folded the parcel and the  song-priest received it and touched it to the soles of the feet, knees,  palms, breast, and back and mouth of the invalid; he then put a pinch of  the pollen into the invalid's mouth, and a pinch on the top of the head;  he placed the folded husk in the invalid's hand, and stood in front of him  and whispered a long prayer which the invalid repeated after him. The  manner of holding the husk has been previously described. The man with  painted face received the husk from the theurgist, who returned to his  seat and at once opened the chant with the rattle. At the close of the  chant the holder of the husk touched the soles of the feet, palms, etc.,  of the invalid with it and left the lodge. This precious parcel was taken  three miles distant and deposited in a canyon near a spring where there is  a luxuriant growth of reeds. Prayers were offered by the depositor for  health, rain, food, and good fortune to all. Only the theurgist and his  attendants and a few of the near relatives of the invalid were present at  this ceremony.                                  [Illustration]          SECOND CEREMONY.      The sweat-house priest preceded the invalid and song-priest, the latter  carrying his medicine basket, wands, etc. The hot stones and pine boughs  were put into the sweat house; meal was sprinkled around the west base and  the wands deposited, as before described, by the song-priest. Three white  and black striped blankets were placed over the entrance, one upon the  other, and upon these were a buckskin and several folds of white muslin.  An attendant brought a large medicine bowl half filled with pine needles;  water was poured upon these; a small earthen bowl and a gourd containing  water were placed before the song-priest, who put into the bowl chopped  sage, over which he sprinkled dried foods reduced to powder; a small  quantity of meal was also sprinkled into the gourd and bowl. The song then  began. A small pine bough was laid to the right of the entrance of the  sweat house. The opening of the song was a call upon the gods to impart to  the medicine power to complete the cure of the invalid and to make all  people well, and to have a wet and good ground all over the earth. This  song is specially addressed to Toneennili, the water sprinkler.    Hasjelti and Hostjoghon arrived just as the sick man emerged from the  sweat house. The invalid bathed himself from the bowl of pine needles and  water. Taking the sheep's horn in the left hand and a piece of hide in the  right, Hasjelti pressed the invalid's body as before described. The god  was requested by the priest of the sweat house to pay special attention to  the rubbing of the head of the invalid. The small gourd was handed to  Hasjelti, who gave four drafts of its contents to the invalid. Hasjelti  touched the soles of the feet, palms, etc., of the invalid with medicine  water from the bowl. The gods then suddenly disappeared. On this occasion  Hostjoghon took no part in administering the medicine. The invalid, after  putting on his clothing, proceeded to the lodge, followed by the  song-priest. The sweat house was razed as usual, and the pine boughs and  stones were placed to the north of the house in a small pinon tree; the  logs of the house were deposited on the ground a few feet from the tree. A  line of meal the length of the medicine tube was sprinkled on the logs and  the tube laid thereon. Meal was sprinkled over the tube and logs.          THIRD CEREMONY.      The first sand painting occurred on October 16; it was begun in the early  forenoon and completed at sundown. Common yellowish sand was brought in  blankets. This formed the ground color for the painting. It was laid to  form a square 3 inches in depth and 4 feet in diameter. Upon this three  figures were painted after the manner described of the painting of the  rainbow over the sweat house. Nine turkey wands were placed on the south,  west, and north sides of the square, and a line of meal with four  foot-marks extended from near the entrance of the lodge to the painting.  (See Pl. CXX.)    Hasjelti stands to the north end in the illustration, holding the emblem  of the concentrated winds. The square is ornamented at the corners with  eagle plumes, tied on with cotton cord; an eagle plume is attached to the  head of Hasjelti with cotton cord. The upper horizontal lines on the face  denote clouds; the perpendicular lines denote rain; the lower horizontal  and perpendicular lines denote the first vegetation used by man.  Hasjelti's chin is covered with corn pollen, the head is surrounded with  red sunlight, the red cross lines on the blue denote larynx; he wears ear  rings of turquoise, fringed leggings of white buckskin, and beaded  moccasins tied on with cotton cord. The figure to the south end is  Hostjoghon; he too has the eagle plume on the head, which is encircled  with red sunshine. His earrings are of turquoise; he has fox-skin ribbons  attached to the wrists; these are highly ornamented at the loose ends with  beaded pendants attached by cotton strings; he carries wild turkey and  eagle feather wands, brightened with red, blue, and yellow sunbeams. The  center figure is one of the Hostjobokon, and upon this figure the invalid  for whom the ceremonial is held sits. The four footprints are made of  meal. These the invalid steps upon as he advances and takes his seat, with  knees drawn up, upon the central figure. After dark the invalid walked  over the line of meal, being careful to step upon the footprints in order  that his mental and moral qualities might be strengthened. The invalid  removed his clothing immediately after entering the lodge; he had downy  breast feathers of the eagle attached to the scalp lock with white cotton  cord; he advanced to the painting and took his seat upon the central  figure. An attendant followed him, and with his right hand swept the line  of meal after the invalid, removing all traces of it. The entrance of the  invalid into the lodge was a signal for the song-priest to open the chant  with the rattle. Hasjelti and Hostjoghon bounded into the lodge hooting  wildly. The former carried the square (the concentrated winds), which he  placed over the sick man's head. Hostjoghon carried a turkey wand in each  hand, and these he waved over the invalid's head and hooted; this was  repeated four times, and each time the gods ran out of the lodge. Hasjelti  wore a velvet dress, but Hostjoghon's body was nude, painted white. This  wild, weird ceremony over, the sick man arose and the song-priest gathered  the turkey wands from around the painting, while an attendant erased it by  rubbing his hands over the sand to the center. The sands were gathered  into a blanket and carried out of the lodge and deposited some distance  away from the lodge, where the sun could not generate the germ of the  disease. The sand is never touched by any one when once carried out,  though before the paintings are erased the people clamor to touch them,  and then rub their hands over their own bodies that they may be cured of  any malady. The invalid, after putting on his clothes, returned to his  family lodge. A group then gathered around the spot where the paintings  had been and joined in a weird chant, which closed the fifth day's  ceremony.                                  [Illustration]            SIXTH DAY.      Preparations for a great sand painting began at daylight. Sand for the  ground work was carried in"]]]
