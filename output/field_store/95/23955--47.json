He took advantage then of the temporary absence of their  army in the west, and descended upon their homes in the region now known  as Bessarabia and massacred all their wives and children. This act of  savage cruelty drove the Magyars away finally from the Danube, and they  migrated north and west to found the present kingdom of Hungary.    Relieved of the fear of the Magyars, King Simeon now attacked the  Grecian Empire again, captured Adrianople, and laid siege to  Constantinople. There were two emperors in the city then, in succession  to Leo the Philosopher--Romanus Lecapenus and Constantine  Porphyrogenitus. For all the grandeur of their names they rivalled one  another in incompetency and timidity. Simeon was able to force upon the  Grecian Empire a humiliating peace, which made Bulgaria now the  paramount Power in the Balkans, since Servia had been already subdued by  her arms. From the Roman Pope, Simeon received authority to be called  \"Czar of the Bulgarians and Autocrat of the Greeks.\" His capital at  Preslav--now in ruins--was in his time one of the great cities of  Europe, and a contemporary description of his palace says:        If a stranger coming from afar enters the outer court of the      princely dwelling, he will be amazed, and ask many a question as      he walks up to the gates. And if he goes within, he will see on      either side buildings decorated with stone and wainscoted with      wood of various colours. And if he goes yet farther into the      courtyard he will behold lofty palaces and churches, bedecked      with countless stones and wood and frescoes without, and with      marble and copper and silver and gold within. Such grandeur he      has never seen before, for in his own land there are only      miserable huts of straw. Beside himself with astonishment, he      will scarce believe his eyes. But if he perchance espy the      prince sitting in his robe covered with pearls, with a chain of      coins round his neck and bracelets on his wrists, girt about      with a purple girdle and a sword of gold at his side, while on      either hand his nobles are seated with golden chains, girdles,      and bracelets upon them; then will he answer when one asks him      on his return home what he has seen: \"I know not how to      describe it; only thine own eyes could comprehend such      splendour.\"    Under Simeon, art and literature flourished (in a Middle Ages sense) in  Bulgaria; the Cyrillic alphabet--still used in Russia, Bulgaria, and  Servia--had supplanted the Greek alphabet and had added to the growing  sense of national consciousness. Simeon encouraged the production of  books, and tradition credits him with having himself translated into the  Slav language some of the writings of St. Chrysostom.    [Illustration: A WEDDING IN THE RHODOPES]    But all this Bulgarian prosperity had a serious check when Simeon died  in 927 and the Czar Peter ascended the throne. Scarcely was Simeon cold  in his grave before internal struggles had begun, owing to the  jealousies of some of the nobles and their spirit of adventure. The  boyars (knights) of Bulgaria had always had great authority. Now they  took advantage of a monarch who was more suited for the cloister than  the Court to revive old pretensions to independent power. Czar Peter  turned to the Greek Empire for help, and sought to strengthen his  position at home by a marriage with the grand-daughter of the Emperor  Romanus Lecapenus. That policy served until a vigorous Greek Emperor  came to the throne at Constantinople and set himself to avenge the  victories of Simeon. The Greek Emperor called in the aid of the northern  Russians against their kinsfolk the Bulgarian Slavs. There followed a  typical Balkan year of war. The Russians succeeded only too well against  the Bulgarians, and then the Greeks, in fear, joined with the Bulgarians  to resist their further progress. Then the Servians took advantage of  the war to shake off the Bulgarian suzerainty and regain their  independence. An opposition party in Bulgaria, disgusted with the  misfortunes which had befallen their country under Peter, added to these  misfortunes by a revolt, and seceded to found the kingdom of Western  Bulgaria under the boyar Shishman Mokar (963). To add to the troubles of  the Balkans, the Bogomil heresy appeared, dividing further the strength  of the Bulgarian nation. The Bogomils were the first of a long series of  Slavonic fanatics, ancestors in spirit of the Doukhobors, the Stundists,  and the Tolstoyans of our days, preaching the hermit life as the only  truly holy one, forbidding marriage as well as war and the eating of  meat. It was with such dissensions among the Christian states of the  Balkans that the way was prepared for the coming of the Turk to the  Peninsula.    In 969 Boris II. followed Peter on the Bulgarian throne. He was faced by  a new Russian invasion and by an attack from Czar David of Western  Bulgaria. This latter attack he beat off, but was overwhelmed before the  tide of Russian invasion and himself captured in battle. The Russians  passed over Bulgaria to attack Constantinople, and that brought the  Greeks into line with the Bulgarians to resist the invader. The Emperor  John Zemissius made bold war upon the Russians, and captured from them  their Bulgarian prisoner, the Czar Boris II. The Greek Emperor made no  magnanimous use of his victory. He deposed the Bulgarian Czar and the  Bulgarian Patriarch, emasculated the Czar's brother, and turned Bulgaria  into a Greek province. Only in the rebel province of West Bulgaria did  Bulgarian independence at this time survive, and from that province  there arose in time a deliverer, the Czar Samuel, who was the fourth son  of that boyar Shishman who founded the Western Bulgarian kingdom. At the  beginning of his reign, in 976, Samuel had control only over the  territory which is now known as Macedonia, but soon he united to it all  the old Empire of Bulgaria, and stretched the sway of his race over much  of the land which is now comprised in Albania, Greece, and Servia. He  began, then, a stern war with the Greek Emperor, Basil II., known to  history as \"the Bulgar-slayer,\" against whom is alleged a cruelty  horrible even for the Balkans.    Capturing a Bulgarian army of over 10,000 men, Basil II. had all the  soldiers blinded, leaving to each of their centurions, however, one eye,  so that the mutilated men might be led back to their own country. A  realistically horrible picture in the Sofia National Gallery  commemorates this classic horror.    The war between the Czar Samuel and the Emperor Basil II. was marked by  fluctuating fortunes. At first the Bulgarians were altogether  successful, and in 981 Basil was so completely defeated that for fifteen  years he was obliged to leave Samuel as the real master of the Balkan  Peninsula. Then the tide turned. Near Thermopylae, Samuel was decisively  defeated by the Greeks, and soon after found his Empire reduced to the  dimensions of Albania and West Macedonia. War troubles that the Greeks  had with Asia brought to the Czar Samuel a brief respite, but a  campaign in 1014--this was the one marked by the blinding of the captive  Bulgarian army--shattered finally his power. He died that year  heart-broken, it is said, at the sight of the return of his blinded  army.    Thus, to quote a Bulgarian chronicle:        In 1015 Bulgaria was brought to subjection. A new state of      things began for the Bulgarians, who till then had never felt      the control of an enemy. The people longed for liberty, and      there were many attempts at revolt. Towards 1186, two brothers,      John and Peter Assen, raised a revolt and succeeded in      re-establishing the ancient kingdom, choosing as capital      Tirnova, their native town. It was then that Tirnova became what      it still remains, the historic town of Bulgaria. The reign of      John and Peter Assen was a brilliant time for Bulgaria. Art and      literature flourished as never before, and commerce developed to      a considerable extent. Once more the Bulgarian Empire was      respected and feared abroad.    But this Bulgarian Empire was doomed to as short a life as its  predecessor, though for a brief while it held out the illusionary hope  of permanency. Bulgaria, from the Danube to the Rhodope Mountains, was  won from the Greeks, and John Assen was powerful enough to dream of  entering into alliance with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. An  assassin's sword, however, ended John Assen's life prematurely. He was  followed on the throne by his brother Peter. He, too, was assassinated,  and was succeeded by his brother Kalojan, who had all the warlike  virtues of John Assen, and re-established the Bulgarian Empire with  territories which embraced more than half the whole Balkan Peninsula.  Seeking to add to the reality of power some validity of title, Kalojan  entered into negotiations with the Pope of Rome, made his submission to  the Roman Church, and was crowned by a Papal nuncio as king.    It was about this time that Constantinople was captured by the  Crusaders, and Count Baldwin of Flanders ascended the throne of the  Caesars. The Greeks, driven from their capital but still holding some  territory, made an alliance with Kalojan, and once again Greek and  Bulgar fought side by side, defeating the Franks and taking the Emperor  Baldwin prisoner. Then the alliance ended--never, it seems, can Bulgar  and Greek be long at peace--and a war raged between the Greek Empire and  Bulgaria, until in 1207 Kalojan was assassinated.    A brief period of prosperity continued for Bulgaria while John Assen  II. was on the throne. He was the most civilised and humane of all the  rulers of ancient Bulgaria, and there is no stain of a massacre or a  murder remembered against his name. He made wars reluctantly, but always  successfully."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22260"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Abbey Church of Tewkesbury (#8)"],[1,"not long before the Dissolution for the purpose of making  room for a larger and more splendid chapel. This chapel, Mr. Blunt  adds, was never completed, the plans of the builders being upset by  the general dissolution of the monasteries.    The Capella Ecclesiae Conventualis above mentioned would rather imply  the existence of another Capella Mariae to which the parishioners had  ordinary access, and this reference to it tends to strengthen the  theory that on the north side of the north transept there was a  detached Lady Chapel as at Bristol.    On the other hand, the orders of Henry VIII.'s Commissioners expressly  mention the Lady Chapel as a part of the building to be pulled down,  as being superfluous. This is a matter of exact history, and we have  either to accept the conclusion that the Commissioners ordered the  chapel to be destroyed, and that it was done, or else that they  ordered the destruction of a building which did not exist. To support  the former alternative we have the tradition, and it is nothing more,  that the Lady Chapel was destroyed because of the delay of the good  people of Tewkesbury in buying the choir.    FOOTNOTES:    [3] Some of the stone in the tower is undoubtedly Caen stone, brought  from Normandy for the work.    [4] Mr. W. St. John Hope suggests that there was to be _one_ central  western tower, within which this arch would not look out of place.    [5] A good view of the north-east end at close quarters can be  obtained from the Abbey Tea Gardens.    [6] There are records of interments in the Lady Chapel: William Lord  de la Zouch of Mortimer in 1335, another Lord de la Zouch in 1371, and  the widow of the latter in 1408. In 1472 the Bishop of Worcester  appropriated the church of Little Compton to the Convent of Tewkesbury  to augment the salaries of the priests officiating in the chapel of  the Virgin Mary there.          CHAPTER III.    THE INTERIOR.      THE NAVE.    The Norman nave bears a close resemblance to that at Gloucester, and  has the distinguishing feature of the simple cylindrical columns.  These massive piers are found at the Priory Church at Great Malvern,  and also at Pershore; but those at Gloucester and Tewkesbury are  considerably larger than the others.[7] At Tewkesbury the nave is  particularly impressive from the height of the piers, and from the  severely formal character of the arches supported by them. The  simplicity of the nave as a whole has led some to ascribe the building  of it to a date earlier than that of the nave at Gloucester; but if  the received accounts go for anything, the building of the two fabrics  was contemporaneous. Pershore, Gloucester, and Tewkesbury are by some  considered to have been the production of one master-builder. If this  be so, it is a matter of regret that his name has not come down to our  time.    At Gloucester and at Tewkesbury many of the stones bear on their faces  the interesting devices incised by the Norman masons. These marks are  in many cases the same, but there are some found at Gloucester which  are not found at Tewkesbury, and _vice versa_. One small point may be  noticed which may perhaps interest a few, viz., that the same workman  set out and worked at the first few courses of the stone work of the  staircases, and then was followed by others, possibly less  intelligent, but capable of following the indicated plan. A monk named  Alfred was the \"Master of the Work,\" and it would be interesting to  know if the stones marked A are marked with his mark.       [Illustration: _Photo. A.H. Hughes._     THE NAVE, FROM THE WEST END.]    The nave here was being built in all probability while the great  Flambard was busy with Durham (1105-1130), and very soon after he had  finished his labours at Twynham or Christchurch, Hants. Gloucester is  generally assigned to Serlo, 1089 to 1100, and Norwich was begun in  1096.       [Illustration: MASONS' MARKS.]    Above the arches of the nave are small double round-headed openings  into a very narrow triforium walk, which is vaulted, as at Gloucester,  with a quadrantal arch.    There is another peculiarity, too, here, in that the vaulting of the  roof springs from corbels which rest directly on the capitals of the  piers. As a result of this the roof looks low and heavy.    The triforium openings, which are divided by small shafts, similar in  character to those in the tower chamber, are 5 feet 6 inches high and  4 feet 10 inches wide. The passage is 26 inches wide and 6-1/2 to 7 feet  high.    The two western bays of the triforium are not alike. On the north the  openings correspond to those in the other bays, and are not contracted  to correspond with the narrowed arch below; whereas on the south side  they are so contracted. By this means the square angle of the western  pier was continued to the roof. On the north side the western pier  ends abruptly at the capital of the respond.    The clerestory windows are partly concealed by the vaulting. Of course  the original windows were much smaller, and were removed and the space  enlarged when the re-roofing was done in the fourteenth century.    =The Roof.=--Originally, no doubt, as at Peterborough, where it  remains, the inner roof was a flat panelled ceiling of wood, supported  by a moulded framing. Whether the wooden roof decayed or was destroyed  by fire, it was found necessary in the early part of the fourteenth  century to re-roof the nave, and the present vaulting was then  constructed. Beautiful though it is architecturally, it has the effect  of dwarfing the nave, as it springs directly from the tops of the  piers in the nave. In character it is a simple pointed vaulting, and  the ribs at their many points of intersection are lavishly decorated  with bosses.    Originally the vaulting was painted and gilded, but owing to the  idiosyncrasies of those who fancied they were having things done  \"decently and in order,\" it was colour-washed in the early part of  this century. The present scheme of colour decoration was carried out  by Mr. T. Gambier Parry. Its chief merit is that it throws out the  bosses in very strong relief. The bosses can be studied with an  opera-glass, but it is less fatiguing to examine them with the help of  a pocket mirror. There is a tradition that the bosses were carved by a  monk who was not held in much esteem by his companions, and was a butt  for their gibes and witticisms. Whether this was so or not, he knew  how to carve rudely and effectively in stone, and long may his work  remain with us. They represent in a highly pictorial manner the life  of our Lord. Beginning at the west end, the central bosses depict: (1)  The Nativity. (2) The Shepherds rendering homage. (3) The Magi on  their journey. (4) The Magi in adoration. (5) The finding of Christ in  the Temple. (6) The triumphal entry into Jerusalem. (7) The Last  Supper.[8] (8) The Betrayal. (9) The Flagellation. (10) The  Crucifixion. (11) The Resurrection. (12) The Ascension. (13) The Day  of Pentecost. (14) The Coronation of the Virgin. (15) The Last  Judgment.    The other bosses contain angels bearing musical instruments of every  known kind, and alternating, more or less regularly, with angels  censing and angels bearing emblems of the Passion.    On the south side: (1) Angels with pipe and tambourine. (2) Angels  with cymbals and bagpipes. (3) Angels with hurdy-gurdy and harp. (4)  Angels with dulcimer and organ. (5 and 6) Angels censing. (7) St.  Matthew and St. John with their emblems, a scroll and an eagle. (8)  Angel with a violin; others with emblems of the Passion, _i.e._,  posts, spear, and scourges.    On the north side are to be found: (1) Angel with pipe and tabor;  another censing. (2) Angel with harp; another censing. (3) Angels with  rebec and zither. (4) Angels with tabor and zither. (5 and 6) Angels  censing. (7) St. Luke and St. Mark, with their emblems, a winged ox,  and a winged lion. (8) Angel with a harp; others with emblems of the  Passion, _i.e._, a crown of thorns, a sponge, a cross, and a scourge.    Mr. Gambier Parry, who personally supervised, where he did not  personally execute, the decoration of the roof, termed it \"a  marvellous specimen of English carving,\" and says that \"together with  the cathedrals of Gloucester and Norwich, it combined some of the  finest features of mediaeval sculpture.\" Further he adds that though  \"fine details must not be looked for, yet it exhibited a vigour of  conception and a charm of inspiration which quite atoned for any  faults.\"    At the west end of the building are two half-figures, male and female,  like the figure-heads of ships, which serve as corbels for the  vaulting of the roof. They have been thought by some to represent Adam  and Eve, and by others to represent the founder, Fitz-Hamon, and  Sibylla his wife.    =The Font= (p. 40).--With the exception of the shaft, which has some  good hall-flower ornament,[9] and the Purbeck marble base, this is  entirely new work, dating only from the restoration carried out  1875-79. Formerly the old font, of which portions remain in the  church, stood in the apsidal chapel in the south transept, and the  choice of position for the new one is not quite happy. The canopy is  very fine work, but the font as a whole is as much too high as the  choir screen is too low. It is also placed at far too great a height  above the surrounding floor to be comfortable for a party of sponsors,  and from its height it interferes with the beautiful vista of the nave  as viewed from the outside of the open west door on a fine day in  summer. There is no reason for placing the font in this position, and  a Baptistery could have well been made in the north-west corner of the  nave.    =The Lectern=, also a gift from Rev. C.W. Grove in memory of his wife,  was presented in 1878. Formerly it blocked up the central passage up  the nave, but was removed to counterbalance the pulpit.    =The Pulpit= was given to the"]]]
