To these terms  Lycophron agreed; and Periander was making ready to pass into Corcyra  and his son to return to Corinth, when the Corcyreans, being informed  of what was taking place, to keep Periander away, put the young man to  death. For this reason it was that Periander took vengeance on the  Corcyreans.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 15: From Book III of the \"History.\" Translated by George  Rawlinson. Periander was tyrant of Corinth, succeeding to power about  625 B.C. He is believed to have reigned forty years.]    [Footnote 16: A city on the coast of Argolis, one of the states of  southern Greece.]    [Footnote 17: Now known as Corfu, an island lying off the western  coast of Greece, adjacent to Epirus.]          THUCYDIDES         Born in Athens about 471 B.C.; died about 401; celebrated as       a historian; claimed blood relationship with Miltiades and       Cimon; possest an ample fortune; in 424 commanded an       expedition against Brasidas, but failing in it went into       exile, returning to Athens twenty years later; did not live       to finish his \"History of the Peloponnesian War,\" the       narrative ending seven years before the war closed; the       Greek text first printed by Aldus at Venice in 1502.[18]    I    THE ATHENIANS AND SPARTANS CONTRASTED[19]      Such were the causes of ill feeling which at this time existed between  the Athenians and Peloponnesians;[20] the Corinthians complaining that  the Athenians were blockading their colony of Potidaea, which was  occupied by a Corinthian and Peloponnesian garrison; the Athenians  rejoining that the Peloponnesians had excited to revolt a state which  was an ally and tributary of theirs, and that they had now openly  joined the Potidaeans, and were fighting on their side. The  Peloponnesian war, however, had not yet broken out; the peace still  continued; for thus far the Corinthians had acted alone.    But now, seeing Potidaea[21] besieged, they bestirred themselves in  earnest. Corinthian troops were shut up within the walls, and they  were afraid of losing the town; so without delay they invited the  allies to meet at Sparta. There they inveighed against the Athenians,  whom they affirmed to have broken the treaty and to have wronged the  Peloponnesians.... The Megarians alleged, among other grounds of  complaint, that they were excluded from all harbors within the  Athenian dominion and from the Athenian market, contrary to the  treaty. The Corinthians waited until the other allies had stirred up  the Lacedaemonians; at length they came forward, and, last of all,  spoke as follows:    \"The spirit of trust, Lacedaemonians, which animates your own political  and social life makes you distrust others who, like ourselves, have  something unpleasant to say, and this temper of mind, tho favorable to  moderation, too often leaves you in ignorance of what is going on  outside your own country. Time after time we have warned you of the  mischief which the Athenians would do to us, but instead of taking our  words to heart, you chose to suspect that we spoke only from  interested motives. And this is the reason why you have brought the  allies to Sparta, too late, not before but after the injury has been  inflicted, and when they are smarting under the sense of it. Which of  them all has a better right to speak than ourselves, who have the  heaviest accusations to make, outraged as we are by the Athenians, and  neglected by you? If the crimes which they are committing against  Hellas were being done in a corner, then you might be ignorant, and we  should have to inform you of them; but now, what need of many words?  Some of us, as you see, have been already enslaved; they are at this  moment intriguing against others, notably against allies of ours; and  long ago they had made all their preparations in expectation of war.  Else why did they seduce from her allegiance Corcyra, which they still  hold in defiance of us, and why are they blockading Potidaea, the  latter a most advantageous post for the command of the Thracian  peninsula, the former a great naval power which might have assisted  the Peloponnesians?    \"And the blame of all this rests on you; for you originally allowed  them to fortify their city after the Persian war, and afterward to  build their Long Walls;[22] and to this hour you have gone on  defrauding of liberty their unfortunate subjects, and are now  beginning to take it away from your own allies. For the true enslaver  of a people is he who can put an end to their slavery, but has no care  about it; and all the more, if he be reputed the champion of liberty  in Hellas. And so we have met at last, but with what difficulty! and  even now we have no definite object. By this time we ought to have  been considering, not whether we are wronged, but how we are to be  revenged. The aggressor is not now threatening, but advancing; he has  made up his mind, while we are resolved about nothing. And we know too  well how by slow degrees and with stealthy steps the Athenians  encroach upon their neighbors. While they think that you are too dull  to observe them, they are more careful; but, when they know that you  wilfully overlook their aggressions, they will strike you and not  spare. Of all Hellenes, Lacedaemonians, you are the only people who  never do anything; on the approach of an enemy, you are content to  defend yourselves against him, not by acts, but by intentions, and  seek to overthrow him, not in the infancy but in the fulness of his  strength. How came you to be considered safe? That reputation of  yours was never justified by facts. We all know that the Persian made  his way from the ends of the earth against Peloponnesus before you  encountered him in a worthy manner; and now you are blind to the  doings of the Athenians, who are not at a distance, as he was, but  close at hand. Instead of attacking your enemy, you wait to be  attacked, and take the chances of a struggle which has been deferred  until his power is doubled. And you know that the barbarian miscarried  chiefly through his own errors, and that we have oftener been  delivered from these very Athenians by blunders of their own than by  any aid from you. Some have already been ruined by the hopes which you  inspired in them; for so entirely did they trust you that they took no  precautions themselves. These things we say in no accusing or hostile  spirit--let that be understood--but by way of expostulation. For men  expostulate with erring friends; they bring accusations against  enemies who have done them a wrong.    \"And surely we have a right to find fault with our neighbors if any  one ever had. There are important interests at stake to which, as far  as we can see, you are insensible. And you have never considered what  manner of men are these Athenians with whom you will have to fight,  and how utterly unlike yourselves. They are revolutionary, equally  quick in the conception and in the execution of every new plan; while  you are conservative--careful only to keep what you have, originating  nothing, and not acting even when action is most necessary. They are  bold beyond their strength; they run risks which prudence would  condemn; and in the midst of misfortune they are full of hope. Whereas  it is your nature, tho strong, to act feebly; when your plans are most  prudent, to distrust them; and when calamities come upon you, to think  that you will never be delivered from them. They are impetuous, and  you are dilatory; they are always abroad, and you are always at home.  For they hope to gain something by leaving their homes; but you are  afraid that any new enterprise may imperil what you have already. When  conquerors, they pursue their victory to the utmost; when defeated,  they fall back the least. Their bodies they devote to their country as  tho they belonged to other men; their true self is in their mind,  which is most truly their own when employed in her service. When they  do not carry out an intention which they have formed, they seem to  have sustained a personal bereavement; when an enterprise succeeds,  they have gained a mere instalment of what is to come; but if they  fail, they at once conceive new hopes and so fill up the void. With  them alone to hope is to have, for they lose not a moment in the  execution of an idea. This is the lifelong task, full of danger and  toil, which they are always imposing upon themselves. None enjoy their  good things less, because they are always seeking for more. To do  their duty is their only holiday, and they deem the quiet of inaction  to be as disagreeable as the most tiresome business. If a man should  say to them, in a word, that they were born neither to have peace  themselves nor to allow peace to other men, he would simply speak the  truth.    \"In the face of such an enemy, Lacedaemonians, you persist in doing  nothing. You do not see that peace is best secured by those who use  their strength justly, but whose attitude shows that they have no  intention of submitting to wrong. Justice with you seems to consist in  giving no annoyance to others and in defending yourselves only against  positive injury. But this policy would hardly be successful, even if  your neighbors were like yourselves; and in the present case, as we  pointed out just now, your ways compared with theirs are  old-fashioned. And, as in the arts, so also in politics, the new must  always prevail over the old. In settled times the traditions of  government should be observed; but when circumstances are changing and  men are compelled to meet them, much originality is required.    \"The Athenians have had a wider experience, and therefore the  administration of their state has improved faster than yours.

III. \"Furor Domini\"    Unfortunately for Vasco Nunez, Arbolancha arrived just two months after  Pedrarias had sailed.  The discovery of the Pacific was the greatest  single exploit since the voyage of Columbus.  It was impossible for the  King to proceed further against Balboa under such circumstances.  Arbolancha was graciously received, therefore, and after his story had  been heard a ship was sent back to Darien instructing Pedrarias to let  Balboa alone, appointing him an adelantado, or governor of the islands  he had discovered in the South Sea, and all such countries as he might  discover beyond.    All this, however took time, and Balboa was having a hard time with  Pedrarias.  In spite of all the skill of the envenomed Encisco, who had  been appointed the public prosecutor in Pedrarias's administration,  Balboa was at last acquitted of having been concerned in the death of  Nicuesa.  Pedrarias, furious at the verdict, made living a burden to  poor Vasco Nunez by civil suits which ate up all his property.    It had not fared well with the expedition of Pedrarias, either, for in  six weeks after they landed, over seven hundred of his unacclimated men  were dead of fever and other diseases, incident to their lack of {43}  precaution and the unhealthy climate of the Isthmus.  They had been  buried in their brocades, as has been pithily remarked, and forgotten.  The condition of the survivors was also precarious.  They were starving  in their silks and satins.    Pedrarias, however, did not lack courage.  He sent the survivors  hunting for treasures.  Under different captains he dispatched them far  and wide through the Isthmus to gather gold, pearls, and food.  They  turned its pleasant valleys and its noble hills into earthly hells.  Murder, outrage and rapine flourished unchecked, even encouraged and  rewarded.  All the good work of Balboa in pacifying the natives and  laying the foundation for a wise and kindly rule was undone in a few  months.    Such cruelties had never before been practised in any part of the New  World settled by the Spaniards.  I do not suppose the men under  Pedrarias were any worse than others.  Indeed, they were better than  some of them, but they took their cue from their terrible commander.  Fiske calls him \"a two-legged tiger.\"  That he was an old man seems to  add to the horror which the story of his course inspires.  The  recklessness of an unthinking young man may be better understood than  the cold, calculating fury and ferocity of threescore and ten.  To his  previous appellations, a third was added.  Men called him, \"_Furor  Domini_\"--\"The Scourge of God.\"  Not Attila himself, to whom the title  was originally applied, was more ruthless and more terrible.    Balboa remonstrated, but to no avail.  He wrote letter after letter to  the king, depicting the results of Pedrarias' actions, and some tidings  of his successive communications, came trickling back to the {44}  governor, who had been especially cautioned by the King to deal  mercifully with the inhabitants and set them an example of Christian  kindness and gentleness that they might be won to the religion of Jesus  thereby!  Pedrarias was furious against Balboa, and would have withheld  the King's dispatches acknowledging the discovery of the South Sea by  appointing him adelantado; but the Bishop of Darien, whose friendship  Balboa had gained, protested and the dispatches were finally delivered.  The good Bishop did more.  He brought about a composition of the bitter  quarrel between Balboa and Pedrarias.  A marriage was arranged between  the eldest daughter of Pedrarias and Balboa.  Balboa still loved his  Indian wife; it is evident that he never intended to marry the daughter  of Pedrarias, and that he entered upon the engagement simply to quiet  the old man and secure his countenance and assistance for the  undertaking he projected to the mysterious golden land toward the  south.  There was a public betrothal which effected the reconciliation.  And now Pedrarias could not do enough for Balboa, whom he called his  \"dear son.\"      IV. The End of Balboa    Balboa, therefore, proposed to Pedrarias that he should immediately set  forth upon the South Sea voyage.  Inasmuch as Pedrarias was to be  supreme in the New World and as Balboa was only a provincial governor  under him, the old reprobate at last consented.    Balboa decided that four ships, brigantines, would be needed for his  expedition.  The only timber fit for shipping, of which the Spaniards  were aware, {45} grew on the eastern side of the Isthmus.  It would be  necessary, therefore, to cut and work up the frames and timbers of the  ships on the eastern side, then carry the material across the Isthmus,  and there put it together.  Vasco Nunez reconnoitered the ground and  decided to start his ship-building operations at a new settlement  called Ada.  The timber when cut and worked had to be carried sixteen  miles away to the top of the mountain, then down the other slope, to a  convenient spot on the river Valsa, where the keels were to be laid,  the frames put together, the shipbuilding completed, and the boats  launched on the river, which was navigable to the sea.    This amazing undertaking was carried out as planned.  There were two  setbacks before the work was completed.  In one case, after the frames  had been made and carried with prodigious toil to the other side of the  mountain, they were discovered to be full of worms and had to be thrown  away.  After they had been replaced, and while the men were building  the brigantines, a flood washed every vestige of their labor into the  river.  But, as before, nothing could daunt Balboa.  Finally, after  labors and disappointments enough to crush the heart of an ordinary  man, two of the brigantines were launched in the river.  Most of the  carrying had been done by Indians, over two thousand of whom died under  the tremendous exactions of the work.    Embarking upon the two brigantines, Balboa soon reached the Pacific,  where he was presently joined by the two remaining boats as they were  completed.  He had now four fairly serviceable ships and three hundred  of the best men of the New World under his command.  He was well  equipped and well provisioned {46} for the voyage and lacked only a  little iron and a little pitch, which, of course, would have to be  brought to him from Ada on the other side of the Isthmus.  The lack of  that little iron and that little pitch proved the undoing of Vasco  Nunez.  If he had been able to obtain them or if he had sailed away  without them, he might have been the conqueror of Peru; in which case  that unhappy country would have been spared the hideous excesses and  the frightful internal brawls and revolutions which afterward almost  ruined it under the long rule of the ferocious Pizarros.  Balboa would  have done better from a military standpoint than his successors, and as  a statesman as well as a soldier the results of his policy would have  been felt for generations.    History goes on to state that while he was waiting for the pitch and  iron, word was brought to him that Pedrarias was to be superseded in  his government.  This would have been delightful tidings under any  other circumstances, but now that a reconciliation had been patched up  between him and the governor, he rightly felt that the arrival of a new  governor might materially alter the existing state of affairs.  Therefore, he determined to send a party of four adherents across the  mountains to Ada to find out if the rumours were true.    If Pedrarias was supplanted the messengers were to return immediately,  and without further delay they would at once set sail.  If Pedrarias  was still there, well and good.  There would be no occasion for such  precipitate action and they could wait for the pitch and iron.  He was  discussing this matter with some friends on a rainy day in 1517--the  month and the date not being determinable now.  The sentry attached to  the governor's quarters, driven to the shelter of the {47} house by the  storm, overheard a part of this harmless conversation.  There is  nothing so dangerous as a half-truth; it is worse than a whole lie.  The soldier who had aforetime felt the weight of Balboa's heavy hand  for some dereliction of duty, catching sentences here and there,  fancied he detected treachery to Pedrarias and thought he saw an  opportunity of revenging himself, and of currying favor with the  governor, by reporting it at the first convenient opportunity.    Now, there lived at Ada at the time one Andres Garavito.  This man was  Balboa's bitter enemy.  He had presumed to make dishonorable overtures  to Balboa's Indian wife.  The woman had indignantly repulsed his  advances and had made them known to her husband.  Balboa had sternly  reproved Garavito and threatened him with death.  Garavito had  nourished his hatred, and had sought opportunity to injure his former  captain.  The men sent by Balboa to Ada to find out the state of  affairs were very maladroit in their manoeuvres, and their peculiar  actions awakened the suspicions of Pedrarias.  The first one who  entered the town was seized and cast into prison.  The others thereupon  came openly to Ada and declared their purposes.  This seems to have  quieted, temporarily, the suspicions of Pedrarias; but the implacable  Garavito, taking opportunity, when the governor's mind was unsettled  and hesitant, assured him that Balboa had not the slightest intention  whatever of marrying Pedrarias's daughter; that he was devoted to his  Indian wife, and intended to remain true to her; that it was his  purpose to sail to the South Sea,"]]]
