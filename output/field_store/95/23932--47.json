According to Lant Carpenter, some 75 per cent. of solid fatty acids may  be obtained from tallow by the sulphuric acid process, owing to the  conversion of a considerable quantity of oleic acid into isoleic acid  (_vide_ p. 12), but in the process a considerable proportion of black  pitch is obtained. C. Dreymann has recently patented (Eng. Pat. 10,466,  1904) two processes whereby the production of any large amount of  hydrocarbons is obviated. In the one case, after saponification with  sulphuric acid, the liberated fatty acids are washed with water and  treated with an oxide, carbonate, or other acid-fixing body, _e.g._,  sodium carbonate, prior to distillation. In this way the distillate is  much clearer than by the ordinary process, and is almost odourless,  while the amount of unsaponifiable matter is only about 1.2 per cent.  The second method claimed consists in the conversion of the fatty acids  into their methyl esters by treatment with methyl alcohol and  hydrochloric acid gas, and purification of the esters by steam  distillation, the pure esters being subsequently decomposed with  superheated steam, in an autoclave, with or without the addition of an  oxide, _e.g._, 0.1 per cent. zinc oxide, to facilitate their  decomposition.    _Twitchell's Reagent._--In Twitchell's process use is made of the  important discovery that aqueous solutions of fatty aromatic sulphuric  acids, such as benzene- or naphthalene-stearosulphonic acid, readily  dissolve fatty bodies, thereby facilitating their dissociation into  fatty acids and glycerol. These compounds are stable at 100 deg. C., and are  prepared by treating a mixture of benzene or naphthalene and oleic acid  with an excess of sulphuric acid, the following reaction taking place:--        C_{6}H_{6} + C_{18}H_{34}O_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} =          C_{6}H_{4}(SO_{3}H)C_{18}H_{35}O + H_{2}O.    On boiling the resultant product with water two layers separate, the  lower one consisting of a clear aqueous solution of sulphuric acid and  whatever benzene-sulphonic acid has been formed, while the upper layer,  which is a viscous oil, contains the benzene-stearosulphonic acid. This,  after washing first with hydrochloric acid and then rapidly with  petroleum ether, and drying at 100 deg. C. is then ready for use; the  addition of a small quantity of this reagent to a mixture of fat  (previously purified) and water, agitated by boiling with open steam,  effects almost complete separation of the fatty acid from glycerol.    The process is generally carried out in two wooden vats, covered with  closely fitting lids, furnished with the necessary draw-off cocks, the  first vat containing a lead coil and the other a brass steam coil.    In the first vat, the fat or oil is prepared by boiling with 1 or 2 per  cent. of sulphuric acid (141 deg. Tw. or 60 deg. B.) for one or two hours and  allowed to rest, preferably overnight; by this treatment the fat is  deprived of any dirt, lime or other impurity present. After withdrawing  the acid liquor, the fat or oil is transferred to the other vat, where  it is mixed with one-fifth of its bulk of water (condensed or  distilled), and open steam applied. As soon as boiling takes place, the  requisite amount of reagent is washed into the vat by the aid of a  little hot water through a glass funnel, and the whole is boiled  continuously for twelve or even twenty-four hours, until the free fatty  acids amount to 85-90 per cent. The amount of reagent used varies with  the grade of material, the smaller the amount consistent with efficient  results, the better the colour of the finished product; with good  material, from 1/2 to 3/4 per cent. is sufficient, but for materials of  lower grade proportionately more up to 2 per cent. is required. The  reaction appears to proceed better with materials containing a fair  quantity of free acidity.    When the process has proceeded sufficiently far, the boiling is stopped  and free steam allowed to fill the vat to obviate any discoloration of  the fatty acids by contact with the air, whilst the contents of the vat  settle.    The settled glycerine water, which should amount in bulk to 50 or 60 per  cent. of the fatty matter taken, and have a density of 7-1/2 deg. Tw. (5 deg.  B.), is removed to a receptacle for subsequent neutralisation with milk  of lime, and, after the separation of sludge, is ready for  concentration.    The fatty acids remaining in the vat are boiled with a small quantity  (0.05 per cent., or 1/10 of the Twitchell reagent requisite) of  commercial barium carbonate, previously mixed with a little water; the  boiling may be prolonged twenty or thirty minutes, and at the end of  that period the contents of the vat are allowed to rest; the water  separated should be neutral to methyl-orange indicator.    It is claimed that fatty acids so treated are not affected by the air,  and may be stored in wooden packages.    _Hydrochloric Acid._--Lewkowitsch (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1903, 67)  has carried out a number of experiments on the accelerating influence of  hydrochloric acid upon the hydrolysis of oils and fats, which show that  acid of a specific gravity of 1.16 has a very marked effect on most  oils, cocoa-nut, cotton-seed, whale and rape oils, tallow and lard being  broken up into fatty acid and glycerol to the extent of some 82-96 per  cent. after boiling 100 grams of the oil or fat with 100 c.c. of acid  for twenty-four hours. The maximum amount of hydrolysis was attained  with cocoa-nut oil, probably owing to its large proportion of the  glycerides of volatile fatty acids. Castor oil is abnormal in only  undergoing about 20 per cent. hydrolysis, but this is attributed to the  different constitution of its fatty acids, and the ready formation of  polymerisation products. Experiments were also made as to whether the  addition of other catalytic agents aided the action of the hydrochloric  acid; mercury, copper sulphate, mercury oxide, zinc, zinc dust,  aluminium chloride, nitrobenzene and aniline being tried, in the  proportion of 1 per cent. The experiments were made on neutral lard and  lard containing 5 per cent. of free fatty acids, but in no case was any  appreciable effect produced.    So far this process has not been adopted on the practical scale, its  chief drawback being the length of time required for saponification.  Undoubtedly the hydrolysis would be greatly facilitated if the oil and  acid could be made to form a satisfactory emulsion, but although saponin  has been tried for the purpose, no means of attaining this object has  yet been devised.    _Sulphurous Acid or Bisulphite._--The use of these substances has been  patented by Stein, Berge and De Roubaix (Germ. Pat. 61,329), the fat  being heated in contact with the reagent for about nine hours at  175 deg.-180 deg. C. under a pressure of some 18 atmospheres, but the process  does not appear to be of any considerable importance.    _Lime._--The use of lime for the saponification of oils and fats was  first adopted on the technical scale for the production of candle-making  material, by De Milly in 1831. The insoluble lime soap formed is  decomposed by sulphuric acid, and the fatty acids steam distilled.    The amount of lime theoretically necessary to hydrolyse a given quantity  of a triglyceride, ignoring for the moment any catalytic influence, can  be readily calculated; thus with stearin the reaction may be represented  by the equation:--         CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                                        CH_{2}OH       |                                                           |      2CHOOC_{18}H_{35} + 3Ca(OH)_{2} = 3Ca(OOC_{18}H_{35})_{2} + 2CHOH       |                                                           |       CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                                        CH_{2}OH        stearin           milk of lime    calcium stearate         glycerol    In this instance, since the molecular weight of stearin is 890 and that  of milk of lime is 74, it is at once apparent that for every 1,780 parts  of stearin, 222 parts of milk of lime or 168 parts of quick-lime, CaO,  would be required. It is found in practice, however, that an excess of  3-5 per cent. above the theoretical quantity of lime is necessary to  complete the hydrolysis of a fat when carried on in an open vessel at  100 deg.-105 deg. C., but that if the saponification be conducted under  pressure in autoclaves the amount of lime necessary to secure almost  perfect hydrolysis is reduced to 2-3 per cent. on the fat, the treatment  of fats with 3 per cent. of lime under a pressure of 10 atmospheres  producing a yield of 95 per cent. of fatty acids in seven hours. The  lower the pressure in the autoclave, the lighter will be the colour of the  resultant fatty acids.    _Magnesia._--It has been proposed to substitute magnesia for lime in the  process of saponification under pressure, but comparative experiments  with lime and magnesia, using 3 per cent. of lime and 2.7 per cent. of  magnesia (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, xii., 163), show that saponification  by means of magnesia is less complete than with lime, and, moreover, the  reaction requires a higher temperature and therefore tends to darken the  product.    _Zinc Oxide._--The use of zinc oxide as accelerating agent has been  suggested by two or three observers. Poullain and Michaud, in 1882, were  granted a patent for this process, the quantity of zinc oxide  recommended to be added to the oil or fat being 0.2 to 0.5 per cent.  Rost, in 1903, obtained a French patent for the saponification of oils  and fats by steam under pressure in the presence of finely divided  metals or metallic oxides, and specially mentions zinc oxide for the  purpose.    It has also been proposed to use zinc oxide in conjunction with lime in  the autoclave to obviate to some extent the discoloration of the fatty  acids.

After a time Joe Blunt reined up, and they proceeded at an easy ambling  pace.  Joe and his friend Henri were so used to these beautiful scenes  that they had long ceased to be _enthusiastically_ affected by them,  though they never ceased to delight in them.    \"I hope,\" said Joe, \"that them sodgers 'll go their ways soon.  I've no  notion o' them chaps when they're left at a place wi' nothin' to do but  whittle sticks.\"    \"Why, Joe!\" exclaimed Dick Varley in a tone of surprise, \"I thought you  were admirin' the beautiful face o' nature all this time, and yer only  thinkin' about the sodgers.  Now, that's strange!\"    \"Not so strange after all, lad,\" answered Joe.  \"When a man's used to a  thing he gits to admire an' enjoy it without speakin' much about it.  But it _is_ true, boy, that mankind gits in coorse o' time to think  little o' the blissins he's used to.\"    \"Oui, c'est _vrai_!\" murmured Henri emphatically.    \"Well, Joe Blunt, it may be so; but I'm thankful _I'm_ not used to this  sort o' thing yet,\" exclaimed Varley.  \"Let's have another gallop--so  ho! come along, Crusoe!\" shouted the youth, as he shook his reins, and  flew over a long stretch of prairie on which at that moment they  entered.    Joe smiled as he followed his enthusiastic companion, but after a short  run he pulled up.    \"Hold on, youngster,\" he cried, \"ye must larn to do as yer bid, lad;  it's trouble enough to be among wild Injuns and wild buffaloes, as I  hope soon to be, without havin' wild comrades to look after.\"    Dick laughed and reined in his panting horse.  \"I'll be as obedient as  Crusoe,\" he said, \"and no one can beat him.\"    \"Besides,\" continued Joe, \"the horses won't travel far if we begin by  runnin' all the wind out o' them.\"    \"Wah!\" exclaimed Henri, as the led horse became restive; \"I think we  must give to him de pack-hoss for to lead, eh!\"    \"Not a bad notion, Henri.  We'll make that the penalty of runnin' off  again; so look out, Master Dick.\"    \"I'm down,\" replied Dick with a modest air, \"obedient as a baby, and  won't run off again--till--the next time.  By the way, Joe, how many  days' provisions did ye bring?\"    \"Two.  That's 'nough to carry us to the Great Prairie, which is three  weeks distant from this; our own good rifles must make up the  difference, and keep us when we git there.\"    \"And s'pose we neither find deer nor buffalo,\" suggested Dick.    \"I s'pose we'll have to starve.\"    \"Dat is cumfer'able to tink upon,\" remarked Henri.    \"More comfortable to think o' than to undergo,\" said Dick, \"but I s'pose  there's little chance o' that.\"    \"Well, not much,\" replied Joe Blunt, patting his horse's neck; \"but d'ye  see, lad, ye niver can count for sartin on anythin'.  The deer and  buffalo ought to be thick in them plains at this time--and when the  buffalo _are_ thick they covers the plains till ye can hardly see the  end o' them; but, ye see, sometimes the rascally Red-skins takes it into  their heads to burn the prairies, and sometimes ye find the place that  should ha' bin black wi' buffalo, black as a coal wi' fire for miles an'  miles on end.  At other times the Red-skins go huntin' in 'ticlar  places, and sweeps them clean o' every hoof that don't git away.  Sometimes, too, the animals seems to take a scunner at a place and keeps  out o' the way.  But one way or another men gin'rally manage to scramble  through.\"    \"Look yonder, Joe,\" exclaimed Dick, pointing to the summit of a distant  ridge, where a small black object was seen moving against the sky,  \"that's a deer, ain't it?\"    Joe shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed earnestly at the object in  question.  \"Yer right, boy; and by good luck we've got the wind of him.  Cut in an' take your chance now.  There's a long strip o' wood as'll let  ye git close to him.\"    Before the sentence was well finished, Dick and Crusoe were off at full  gallop.  For a few hundred yards they coursed along the bottom of a  hollow; then turning to the right they entered the strip of wood, and in  a few minutes gained the edge of it.  Here Dick dismounted.    \"You can't help me here, Crusoe.  Stay where you are, pup, and hold my  horse.\"    Crusoe seized the end of the line, which was fastened to the horse's  nose, in his mouth, and lay down on a hillock of moss, submissively  placing his chin on his fore-paws, and watching his master as he stepped  noiselessly through the wood.  In a few minutes Dick emerged from among  the trees, and, creeping from bush to bush, succeeded in getting to  within six hundred yards of the deer, which was a beautiful little  antelope.  Beyond the bush behind which he now crouched all was bare  open ground, without a shrub or hillock large enough to conceal the  hunter.  There was a slight undulation in the ground, however, which  enabled him to advance about fifty yards further, by means of lying down  quite flat and working himself forward like a serpent.  Further than  this he could not move without being seen by the antelope, which browsed  on the ridge before him in fancied security.  The distance was too great  even for a long shot, but Dick knew of a weak point in this little  creature's nature which enabled him to accomplish his purpose--a weak  point which it shares in common with animals of a higher order,--namely,  curiosity.    The little antelope of the North American prairies is intensely curious  about everything that it does not quite understand, and will not rest  satisfied until it has endeavoured to clear up the mystery.  Availing  himself of this propensity, Dick did what both Indians and hunters are  accustomed to do on these occasions,--he put a piece of rag on the end  of his ramrod, and, keeping his person concealed and perfectly still,  waved this miniature flag in the air.  The antelope noticed it at once,  and, pricking up its ears, began to advance, timidly and slowly, step by  step, to see what remarkable phenomenon it could be.  In a few seconds  the flag was lowered, a sharp crack followed, and the antelope fell dead  upon the plain.    \"Ha, boy! that's a good supper, anyhow,\" cried Joe, as he galloped up  and dismounted.    \"Goot! dat is better nor dried meat,\" added Henri.  \"Give him to me; I  will put him on my hoss, vich is strongar dan yourn.  But ver is your  hoss?\"    \"He'll be here in a minute,\" replied Dick, putting his fingers to his  mouth and giving forth a shrill whistle.    The instant Crusoe heard the sound he made a savage and apparently  uncalled-for dash at the horse's heels.  This wild act, so contrary to  the dog's gentle nature, was a mere piece of acting.  He knew that the  horse would not advance without getting a fright, so he gave him one in  this way which sent him off at a gallop.  Crusoe followed close at his  heels, so as to bring the line alongside of the nag's body, and thereby  prevent its getting entangled; but despite his best efforts the horse  got on one side of a tree and he on the other, so he wisely let go his  hold of the line, and waited till more open ground enabled him to catch  it again.  Then he hung heavily back, gradually checked the horse's  speed, and finally trotted him up to his master's side.    \"'Tis a cliver cur, good sooth,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt in surprise.    \"Ah, Joe! you haven't seen much of Crusoe yet.  He's as good as a man  any day.  I've done little else but train him for two years gone by, and  he can do most anything but shoot--he can't handle the rifle nohow.\"    \"Ha! then, I tink perhaps hims could if he wos try,\" said Henri,  plunging on to his horse with a laugh, and arranging the carcase of the  antelope across the pommel of his saddle.    Thus they hunted and galloped, and trotted and ambled on through wood  and plain all day, until the sun began to descend below the tree-tops of  the bluffs on the west--then Joe Blunt looked about him for a place on  which to camp, and finally fixed on a spot under the shadow of a noble  birch by the margin of a little stream.  The carpet of grass on its  banks was soft like green velvet, and the rippling waters of the brook  were clear as crystal--very different from the muddy Missouri into which  it flowed.    While Dick Varley felled and cut up firewood, Henri unpacked the horses  and turned them loose to graze, and Joe kindled the fire and prepared  venison steaks and hot tea for supper.    In excursions of this kind it is customary to \"hobble\" the horses; that  is, to tie their fore-legs together, so that they cannot run either fast  or far, but are free enough to amble about with a clumsy sort of hop in  search of food.  This is deemed a sufficient check on their tendency to  roam, although some of the knowing horses sometimes learn to hop so fast  with their hobbles as to give their owners much trouble to recapture  them.  But when out in the prairies where Indians are known or supposed  to be in the neighbourhood, the horses are picketed by means of a pin or  stake attached to the ends of their long laryats, as well as hobbled--  for Indians deem it no disgrace to steal or tell lies, though they think  it disgraceful to be found out in doing either.  And so expert are these  dark-skinned natives of the western prairies, that they will creep into  the midst of an enemy's camp, cut the laryats and hobbles of several  horses, spring suddenly on their backs, and gallop away.    They not only steal from white men, but tribes that are at enmity steal  from each other, and the boldness with which they do this is most  remarkable.  When Indians are travelling in a country where enemies are  prowling, they guard their camps at night with jealous care.  The horses  in particular are both hobbled and picketed, and sentries are posted all  round the camp.  Yet, in spite of these precautions, hostile Indians  manage to elude the sentries, and creep into the camp.  When a thief  thus succeeds in effecting an entrance, his "]]]
