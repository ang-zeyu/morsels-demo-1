The vagaries of the architects who began in 1634 to construct the  present edifice, are well illustrated in the changes of plan to which  they subjected this unfortunate church. The length became the breadth,  the isolated chapel of the Virgin, part of the main building; the choir,  another chapel; and the High Altar was removed from the eastern to the  northern end, where a new choir had been built for its reception. This  confusion of plan was carried out with logical confusion of style and  detail. The facade has Corinthian columns of the XVII century; the nave  is said to be \"transition Gothic,\" the choir is decorated with mural  paintings, and the High Altar, a work of Revoil, adds to the banalities  of the XVII and XVIII centuries a rich incongruity of which the XIX has  no reason to be proud. The whole interior is so full of naves of unequal  length, and radiating chapels, of arches of differing forms, tastes, and  styles, that it defies concise description and is unworthy of serious  consideration. Provence has modest Cathedrals of small architectural  significance, but except Sainte-Reparate of Nice, it has none so chaotic  and commonplace as Sainte-Marie-Majeure of Toulon.      [Sidenote: Frejus.]    Frejus, which claims to be \"the oldest city in France,\" was one of the  numerous trading ports of the Phoenician, and later, during the period  of her civic grandeur, an arsenal of the Roman navy. Her most  interesting ruins are the Coliseum, the Theatre, the old Citadel, and  the Aqueduct, suggestions of a really great city of the long-gone past.  Frejus lost prestige with the decadence of the Empire, and after a  destruction by the Saracens in the X century, Nature gave the blow which  finally crushed her when the sea retreated a mile, and her old Roman  light-house was left to overlook merely a long stretch of barren, sandy  land. Owing to this stranded, inland position, she has escaped both the  dignity of a modern sea-port and the prostitution of a Rivieran resort,  and is a little dead city, the seat of an ancient Provencal \"Cathedral  of the Sea.\" This Cathedral is largely free from XVII and XVIII century  disfigurements; and the pity is that having escaped this, a French  church's imminent peril, it should have become so built around that the  character of the exterior is almost lost. The facade is severely plain,  an uninteresting re-building of 1823, but the carved wood of its portals  is beautiful. The towers, as in other maritime Cathedrals of Provence,  recall the perils and dangers of their days; and these towers of Frejus,  although none the less practically defensive, have a more churchly  appearance than those of Antibes, Grasse, and Vence. Over the vestibuled  entrance rises the western tower. Its heavy, rectangular base is the  support of a super-structure which was replaced in the XVI century by  one more in keeping with conventional ecclesiastical models. Then the  windows of the base, whose rounded arches are still traceable, were  walled in; and the new octagonal stage with high windows of its own was  completed by a tile-covered spire. The more interesting tower is that  which surmounts the apse. This was the lookout, facing the sea, the  really vital defence of the church. Its upper room was a storage place  for arms and ammunition, and on the side which faces the city was open,  with a broad, pointed arch. Above, the tower ends in machiolated  battlements and presents a very strong and stern front seaward, perhaps  no stronger, but more artistic and grim than towers of other Provencal  Cathedrals.    The entrance of the church is curiously complicated. To the left is the  little baptistery; directly before one, a narrow stairway which leads to  the Cloister; and on the right, a low-arched vestibule which opens into  the nave of the Cathedral. The interior of Saint-Etienne is dark and  somewhat gloomy, but that is an inherent trait of a fortress-church, for  every added inch of window-opening brought an ell of danger. The nave is  unusually low and broad, and its buttressed piers are of immense weight,  ending severely in a plain, moulded band. On these great piers rest the  cross-vaults of the roof and the broad arches of the wall. The north  aisle, disproportionately narrow, is a later addition. Behind the altar  is a true Provencal apse, shallow and rectangular, and beyond its  rounded roof opens the smaller half-dome. Architecturally, this is an  interesting interior; but the traveller who has not time to spend in  musings will fail to see it in its original intention;--cold, severely  plain, heavy, with perhaps too many arch-lines, but sober and simple. A  futile wooden wainscot now surrounds the church and breaks its wall  space, liberal coats of whitewash conceal the building material, and  taking from the church the severity of its stone, give it an appearance  of poor deprecatory bareness.    [Illustration: \"THE DESECRATION OF THE LITTLE CLOISTER.\"--FREJUS.]    Near the entrance of the Cathedral is its most ancient portion, the  baptistery, formerly a building apart, but now an integral part of the  church itself. It is perhaps the most interesting Christian monument in  Frejus, a reminder of those early centuries when, in France as in Italy,  the little baptistery was the popular form of Christian architectural  expression. Here it has the very usual octagonal shape; the arches are  upheld by grayish columns of granite with capitals of white marble, and  in the centre stands the font. Between the columns are small  recesses, alternately rectangular and semi-domed, and above all, is a  modern dome and lantern. Structurally interesting, and reminiscent of  the stately baptistery of Aix, the effect of this little chamber, like  the church's interior, is marred by the whitewashes from whose  industrious brushes nothing but the grayish columns have escaped. And  here again, the traveller who would see the builders' work, free from  the disfigurements of time, must pause and imagine.    Yet even imagination seems powerless before the desecration of the  little Cloister. Charming it must have been to have entered its quiet  walks, with their slender columns of white marble, to have seen the  quaint old well in the little, sun-lit close. Now, between the slender  columns, boards have been placed which shut out light and sun. The  traveller sat down on an old wheel-barrow, waiting till he could see in  the dim and misty light. All around him was forgetfulness of the  Cloister's holy uses; signs of desecration and neglect. One end of the  cloister-walk was a thoroughfare, where the wheel-barrow had worn its  weary way; and even in the deserted corners there was the dust and dirt  of a work-a-day world. The beautiful little capitals of the slender  columns rose from among the boards, clipped and worn; above, he dimly  saw the curious wooden ceiling which would seem to have taken the place  of the usual stone vaulting; through chinks of the plank-wall he caught  glimpses of a little close; and at length, having seen the most  melancholy of \"Cathedrals of the Sea,\" in its disguise of whitewash,  decay, and misuse, he went his way.      [Sidenote: Antibes.]    That part of the southern coast of France called the Riviera seems now  only to evoke visions of the most beautiful banality; of a life more  artificial than the stage--which at least aims to present  reality--transplanted to a scene of such incomparable loveliness that  Nature herself adds a new and exquisite sumptuousness to the luxury of  civilisation. The Riviera means a land of many follies and every  vice;--each folly so delicious, each vice so regal, they seem to be  sought and desired of all men. Where else can be seen in such careless  magnificence Dukes of Russia with their polish of manner and their  veiled insolence; Englishmen correct and blase; Americans a bit  vociferous and truly amused; great ladies of all ages and manners;  adventurers high and low; and the beautiful, sparkling women of no name,  bravely dressed and barbarously jewelled? Such is the Riviera of to-day;  the life imposed upon it by hordes of foreign idlers in a land whose  warmth and luxuriance may have lent itself but too easily to the vicious  and frivolous pleasures for which they have made it notorious, but a  land which has no native history that is effeminate, nor any so unworthy  as its exotic present. \"The Riviera\" may be Nice, Beaulieu, and their  like, but the Provencal Mediterranean and its neighbouring territory  have been the fatherland of warriors in real mail and of princes of real  power, of the Emperor Pertinax of pagan times, of those who fought  successfully against Mahmoud and Tergament, and of many Knights of  Malta, long the \"Forlorn Hope\" of Christendom.    Discreetly hidden from vulgar eyes that delight in the architecture of the  modern caravanserai, are the ruins of these older days--Amphitheatres,  Fountains, Temples, and Aqueducts of the Romans; the Castles, Abbeys,  and Cathedrals of mediaeval times. Here are the larger number, if not the  most interesting, of those curious churches of the sea, which protected  the French townsman of the Mediterranean coast from the rapacity of  sea-rovers and pirates, and many more orthodox enemies of the Middle Ages.    From the great beauty of its situation, the small city of Antibes is  at once a type of the old regime and of the new. Lying on the sea,  with a background of snow-capped mountains, it has not entirely  escaped the fate of Nice; neither has it yet lost all its old  Provencal characteristics. It is a pathetic compromise between the  quaint reality of the old and the blatancy of the new. The little  parish church is of the very far past, having lost its Cathedral rank  over six hundred years ago to Sainte-Marie in Grasse, a town scarcely  younger than its own.

American bog plants,--pollen in exactly same state  as in hybrids,--same in geraniums. Persian and Chinese{73} lilac will  not seed in Italy and England. Probably double plants and all fruits owe  their developed parts primarily <?> to sterility and extra food thus <?>  applied{74}. There is here gradation <in> sterility and then parts, like  diseases, are transmitted hereditarily. We cannot assign any cause why  the Pontic Azalea produces plenty of pollen and not American{75}, why  common lilac seeds and not Persian, we see no difference in healthiness.  We know not on what circumstances these facts depend, why ferret breeds,  and cheetah{76}, elephant and pig in India will not.         {73} Lindley's remark is quoted in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 9.       Linnaeus' remark is to the effect that Alpine plants tend to be       sterile under cultivation (see _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p.       147). In the same place the author speaks of peat-loving plants       being sterile in our gardens,--no doubt the American bog-plants       referred to above. On the following page (p. 148) the sterility of       the lilac (_Syringa persica_ and _chinensis_) is referred to.         {74} The author probably means that the increase in the petals is       due to a greater food supply being available for them owing to       sterility. See the discussion in _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p.       151. It must be noted that doubleness of the flower may exist       without noticeable sterility.         {75} I have not come across this case in the author's works.         {76} For the somewhat doubtful case of the cheetah (_Felis jubata_)       see _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p. 133. I do not know to what       fact \"pig in India\" refers.    Now in crossing it is certain every peculiarity in form and constitution  is transmitted: an alpine plant transmits its alpine tendency to its  offspring, an American plant its American-bog constitution, and <with>  animals, those peculiarities, on which{77} when placed out of their  natural conditions they are incapable of breeding; and moreover they  transmit every part of their constitution, their respiration, their  pulse, their instinct, which are all suddenly modified, can it be  wondered at that they are incapable of breeding? I think it may be truly  said it would be more wonderful if they did. But it may be asked why  have not the recognised varieties, supposed to have been produced  through the means of man, [not refused to breed] have all bred{78}.  Variation depends on change of condition and selection{79}, as far as  man's systematic or unsystematic selection <has> gone; he takes external  form, has little power from ignorance over internal invisible  constitutional differences. Races which have long been domesticated, and  have much varied, are precisely those which were capable of bearing  great changes, whose constitutions were adapted to a diversity of  climates. Nature changes slowly and by degrees. According to many  authors probably breeds of dogs are another case of modified species  freely crossing. There is no variety which <illegible> has been <illegible>  adapted to peculiar soil or situation for a thousand years and another  rigorously adapted to another, till such can be produced, the question  is not tried{80}. Man in past ages, could transport into different  climates, animals and plants which would freely propagate in such new  climates. Nature could effect, with selection, such changes slowly, so  that precisely those animals which are adapted to submit to great  changes have given rise to diverse races,--and indeed great doubt on  this head{81}.         {77} This sentence should run \"on which depends their incapacity to       breed in unnatural conditions.\"         {78} This sentence ends in confusion: it should clearly close with       the words \"refused to breed\" in place of the bracket and the       present concluding phrase.         {79} The author doubtless refers to the change produced by the       _summation_ of variation by means of selection.         {80} The meaning of this sentence is made clear by a passage in the       MS. of 1844:--\"Until man selects two varieties from the same stock,       adapted to two climates or to other different external conditions,       and confines each rigidly for one or several thousand years to such       conditions, always selecting the individuals best adapted to them,       he cannot be said to have even commenced the experiment.\" That is,       the attempt to produce mutually sterile domestic breeds.         {81} This passage is to some extent a repetition of a previous one       and may have been intended to replace an earlier sentence. I have       thought it best to give both. In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 141, vi.       p. 176, the author gives his opinion that the power of resisting       diverse conditions, seen in man and his domestic animals, is an       example \"of a very common flexibility of constitution.\"    Before leaving this subject well to observe that it was shown that a  certain amount of variation is consequent on mere act of reproduction,  both by buds and sexually,--is vastly increased when parents exposed for  some generations to new conditions{82}, and we now find that many  animals when exposed for first time to very new conditions, are <as>  incapable of breeding as hybrids. It [probably] bears also on supposed  fact of crossed animals when not infertile, as in mongrels, tending to  vary much, as likewise seems to be the case, when true hybrids possess  just sufficient fertility to propagate with the parent breeds and _inter  se_ for some generations. This is Koelreuter's belief. These facts throw  light on each other and support the truth of each other, we see  throughout a connection between the reproductive faculties and exposure  to changed conditions of life whether by crossing or exposure of the  individuals{83}.         {82} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. Chs. I. and V., the author does not       admit reproduction, apart from environment, as being a cause of       variation. With regard to the cumulative effect of new conditions       there are many passages in the _Origin_, Ed. i. e.g. pp. 7, 12, vi.       pp. 8, 14.         {83} As already pointed out, this is the important principle       investigated in the author's _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_.       Professor Bateson has suggested to me that the experiments should       be repeated with gametically pure individuals.    _Difficulties on theory of selection_{84}. It may be objected such  perfect organs as eye and ear, could never be formed, in latter less  difficulty as gradations more perfect; at first appears monstrous and to  <the> end appears difficulty. But think of gradation, even now manifest,  (Tibia and Fibula). Everyone will allow if every fossil preserved,  gradation infinitely more perfect; for possibility of selection a  perfect <?> gradation is required. Different groups of structure, slight  gradation in each group,--every analogy renders it probable that  intermediate forms have existed. Be it remembered what strange  metamorphoses; part of eye, not directly connected with vision, might  come to be [thus used] gradually worked in for this end,--swimming  bladder by gradation of structure is admitted to belong to the ear  system,--rattlesnake. [Woodpecker best adapted to climb.] In some cases  gradation not possible,--as vertebrae,--actually vary in domestic  animals,--less difficult if growth followed. Looking to whole animals, a  bat formed not for flight{85}. Suppose we had flying fish{86} and not  one of our now called flying fish preserved, who would have guessed  intermediate habits. Woodpeckers and tree-frogs both live in countries  where no trees{87}.         {84} In the _Origin_ a chapter is given up to \"difficulties on       theory\": the discussion in the present essay seems slight even when       it is remembered how small a space is here available. For _Tibia_       &c. see p. 48.         {85} This may be interpreted \"The general structure of a bat is the       same as that of non-flying mammals.\"         {86} That is truly winged fish.         {87} The terrestrial woodpecker of S. America formed the subject of       a paper by Darwin, _Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1870. See _Life and       Letters_, vol. iii. p. 153.    The gradations by which each individual organ has arrived at its present  state, and each individual animal with its aggregate of organs has  arrived, probably never could be known, and all present great  difficulties. I merely wish to show that the proposition is not so  monstrous as it at first appears, and that if good reason can be  advanced for believing the species have descended from common parents,  the difficulty of imagining intermediate forms of structure not  sufficient to make one at once reject the theory.      Sec. III. <ON VARIATION IN INSTINCTS AND OTHER MENTAL ATTRIBUTES.>    The mental powers of different animals in wild and tame state [present  still greater difficulties] require a separate section. Be it remembered  I have nothing to do with origin of memory, attention, and the different  faculties of the mind{88}, but merely with their differences in each of  the great divisions of nature. Disposition, courage, pertinacity <?>,  suspicion, restlessness, ill-temper, sagacity and <the> reverse  unquestionably vary in animals and are inherited (Cuba wildness dogs,  rabbits, fear against particular object as man Galapagos{89}). Habits  purely corporeal, breeding season &c., time of going to rest &c., vary  and are hereditary, like the analogous habits of plants which vary and  are inherited. Habits of body, as manner of movement d^o. and d^o.  Habits, as pointing and setting on certain occasions d^o. Taste for  hunting certain objects and manner of doing so,--sheep-dog.
