Surely, knocking  off Percy's hat was an act of simple courtesy which anyone would  have performed automatically!\"    \"You might have been some awful bounder. Or, what would have been  almost worse, a slow-witted idiot who would have stopped to ask  questions before doing anything. To think I should have had the  luck to pick you out of all London!\"    \"I've been looking on it as a piece of luck--but entirely from my  viewpoint.\"    She put a small hand on his arm, and spoke earnestly.    \"Mr. Bevan, you mustn't think that, because I've been laughing a  good deal and have seemed to treat all this as a joke, you haven't  saved me from real trouble. If you hadn't been there and hadn't  acted with such presence of mind, it would have been terrible!\"    \"But surely, if that fellow was annoying you, you could have called  a policeman?\"    \"Oh, it wasn't anything like that. It was much, much worse. But I  mustn't go on like this. It isn't fair on you.\" Her eyes lit up  again with the old shining smile. \"I know you have no curiosity  about me, but still there's no knowing whether I might not arouse  some if I went on piling up the mystery. And the silly part is that  really there's no mystery at all. It's just that I can't tell  anyone about it.\"    \"That very fact seems to me to constitute the makings of a pretty  fair mystery.\"    \"Well, what I mean is, I'm not a princess in disguise trying to  escape from anarchists, or anything like those things you read  about in books. I'm just in a perfectly simple piece of trouble.  You would be bored to death if I told you about it.\"    \"Try me.\"    She shook her head.    \"No. Besides, here we are.\" The cab had stopped at the hotel, and a  commissionaire was already opening the door. \"Now, if you haven't  repented of your rash offer and really are going to be so awfully  kind as to let me have that money, would you mind rushing off and  getting it, because I must hurry. I can just catch a good train,  and it's hours to the next.\"    \"Will you wait here? I'll be back in a moment.\"    \"Very well.\"    The last George saw of her was another of those exhilarating smiles  of hers. It was literally the last he saw of her, for, when he  returned not more than two minutes later, the cab had gone, the  girl had gone, and the world was empty.    To him, gaping at this wholly unforeseen calamity the commissionaire  vouchsafed information.    \"The young lady took the cab on, sir.\"    \"Took the cab on?\"    \"Almost immediately after you had gone, sir, she got in again and  told the man to drive to Waterloo.\"    George could make nothing of it. He stood there in silent  perplexity, and might have continued to stand indefinitely, had not  his mind been distracted by a dictatorial voice at his elbow.    \"You, sir! Dammit!\"    A second taxi-cab had pulled up, and from it a stout, scarlet-  faced young man had sprung. One glance told George all. The hunt  was up once more. The bloodhound had picked up the trail. Percy was  in again!    For the first time since he had become aware of her flight, George  was thankful that the girl had disappeared. He perceived that he  had too quickly eliminated Percy from the list of the Things That  Matter. Engrossed with his own affairs, and having regarded their  late skirmish as a decisive battle from which there would be no  rallying, he had overlooked the possibility of this annoying and  unnecessary person following them in another cab--a task which, in  the congested, slow-moving traffic, must have been a perfectly  simple one. Well, here he was, his soul manifestly all stirred up  and his blood-pressure at a far higher figure than his doctor would  have approved of, and the matter would have to be opened all over  again.    \"Now then!\" said the stout young man.    George regarded him with a critical and unfriendly eye. He disliked  this fatty degeneration excessively. Looking him up and down, he  could find no point about him that gave him the least pleasure,  with the single exception of the state of his hat, in the side of  which he was rejoiced to perceive there was a large and unshapely  dent.    \"You thought you had shaken me off! You thought you'd given me the  slip! Well, you're wrong!\"    George eyed him coldly.    \"I know what's the matter with you,\" he said. \"Someone's been  feeding you meat.\"    The young man bubbled with fury. His face turned a deeper scarlet.  He gesticulated.    \"You blackguard! Where's my sister?\"    At this extraordinary remark the world rocked about George dizzily.  The words upset his entire diagnosis of the situation. Until that  moment he had looked upon this man as a Lothario, a pursuer of  damsels. That the other could possibly have any right on his side  had never occurred to him. He felt unmanned by the shock. It seemed  to cut the ground from under his feet.    \"Your sister!\"    \"You heard what I said. Where is she?\"    George was still endeavouring to adjust his scattered faculties.  He felt foolish and apologetic. He had imagined himself unassailably  in the right, and it now appeared that he was in the wrong.    For a moment he was about to become conciliatory. Then the  recollection of the girl's panic and her hints at some trouble  which threatened her--presumably through the medium of this man,  brother or no brother--checked him. He did not know what it was all  about, but the one thing that did stand out clearly in the welter  of confused happenings was the girl's need for his assistance.  Whatever might be the rights of the case, he was her accomplice,  and must behave as such.    \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said.    The young man shook a large, gloved fist in his face.    \"You blackguard!\"    A rich, deep, soft, soothing voice slid into the heated scene like  the Holy Grail sliding athwart a sunbeam.    \"What's all this?\"    A vast policeman had materialized from nowhere. He stood beside  them, a living statue of Vigilant Authority. One thumb rested  easily on his broad belt. The fingers of the other hand caressed  lightly a moustache that had caused more heart-burnings among the  gentler sex than any other two moustaches in the C-division. The  eyes above the moustache were stern and questioning.    \"What's all this?\"    George liked policemen. He knew the way to treat them. His voice,  when he replied, had precisely the correct note of respectful  deference which the Force likes to hear.    \"I really couldn't say, officer,\" he said, with just that air of  having in a time of trouble found a kind elder brother to help him  out of his difficulties which made the constable his ally on the  spot. \"I was standing here, when this man suddenly made his  extraordinary attack on me. I wish you would ask him to go away.\"    The policeman tapped the stout young man on the shoulder.    \"This won't do, you know!\" he said austerely. \"This sort o' thing  won't do, 'ere, you know!\"    \"Take your hands off me!\" snorted Percy.    A frown appeared on the Olympian brow. Jove reached for his  thunderbolts.    \"'Ullo! 'Ullo! 'Ullo!\" he said in a shocked voice, as of a god  defied by a mortal. \"'Ullo! 'Ullo! 'Ul-lo!\"    His fingers fell on Percy's shoulder again, but this time not in a  mere warning tap. They rested where they fell--in an iron clutch.    \"It won't do, you know,\" he said. \"This sort o' thing won't do!\"  Madness came upon the stout young man. Common prudence and the  lessons of a carefully-taught youth fell from him like a garment.  With an incoherent howl he wriggled round and punched the policeman  smartly in the stomach.    \"Ho!\" quoth the outraged officer, suddenly becoming human. His  left hand removed itself from the belt, and he got a businesslike  grip on his adversary's collar. \"Will you come along with me!\"    It was amazing. The thing had happened in such an incredibly brief  space of time. One moment, it seemed to George, he was the centre  of a nasty row in one of the most public spots in London; the next,  the focus had shifted; he had ceased to matter; and the entire  attention of the metropolis was focused on his late assailant, as,  urged by the arm of the Law, he made that journey to Vine Street  Police Station which so many a better man than he had trod.    George watched the pair as they moved up the Haymarket, followed by  a growing and increasingly absorbed crowd; then he turned into the  hotel.    \"This,\" he said to himself; \"is the middle of a perfect day! And I  thought London dull!\"        CHAPTER 5.    George awoke next morning with a misty sense that somehow the world  had changed. As the last remnants of sleep left him, he was aware  of a vague excitement. Then he sat up in bed with a jerk. He had  remembered that he was in love.    There was no doubt about it. A curious happiness pervaded his  entire being. He felt young and active. Everything was emphatically  for the best in this best of all possible worlds. The sun was  shining. Even the sound of someone in the street below whistling  one of his old compositions, of which he had heartily sickened  twelve months before, was pleasant to his ears, and this in spite  of the fact that the unseen whistler only touched the key in odd  spots and had a poor memory for tunes. George sprang lightly out of  bed, and turned on the cold tap in the bath-room. While he lathered  his face for its morning shave he beamed at himself in the mirror.    It had come at last. The Real Thing.    George had never been in love before. Not really in love. True,  from the age of fifteen, he had been in varying degrees of  intensity attracted sentimentally by the opposite sex. Indeed, at  that period of life of which Mr. Booth Tarkington has written so  searchingly--the age of seventeen--he had been in love with  practically every female he met and with dozens whom he had only  seen in the distance; but ripening years had mellowed his taste and  robbed him of that fine romantic catholicity. During the last five  years women had found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#8)"],[1,"announced that the _elimination_, disguised under  the name of the \"installation royale,\" had been deferred only for the  purpose of \"obtaining the information which was necessary to direct or  decide the choice of the judges, and that it would take place  successively in all the courts and tribunals of the kingdom.\"    The \"installation\" was felt to be not only a breach of faith, but an  open conspiracy against the security of the person and property of the  subject. We knew that the tribunals would now be filled with  magistrates whose prejudices, principles, and interest, must be in  perpetual hostility against our national laws, and that the new men  would seek to elude or crush our juridical system. The royal  magistrates, as it was but too evident, would be the relations, the  friends, or the creatures of the nobility, the emigrants, and of all  who claimed to be restored to their rights and privileges. Nor could  we hope that judges so constituted would deal out impartial justice  between the ci-devant privileged tribes, whom they would naturally  consider as the victims of revolutionary principles, and the children  of the revolution, who, according to the same mode of reasoning, they  could not fail to consider as the oppressors and robbers of the  privileged tribes.    The owners of national property were most alarmed by the approaching  expulsion of the revolutionary judges. By the charter, the  inviolability of their property had been guaranteed to them. But they  had not forgotten that a violent debate arose on the \"redaction\" of  this article; and that the ministers had been already accused on  account of the obscurity of the clause, which they refused to correct  into such words as might prevent all future quibbling and special  pleading.    If the emigrants, the priesthood, and the nobility, did not scruple to  express their hopes aloud that the sales of the national domains might  be declared null and void, it was equally well known to the public  that certain Great Personages entertained the same hopes in secret.  Doubts respecting the legality, and, consequently, of the validity of  the sales, were expressed in the ministerial journals; and various  publications were industriously disseminated, in which the purchases  were directly impugned. The authors of these works were favoured and  protected[10]; and it was whispered that the Great Personages, to  whom we have already alluded, had deliberated on the means of  realizing their hopes. All these tokens of the times united in giving  too reasonable a ground for the apprehensions entertained by the  proprietors of the confiscated lands; and the disorganization of the  tribunals was considered as a national calamity.                       [Footnote 10: M.M. David and Falconnet. In order to                     appease the public indignation, a summons was                     issued against these writers, it being stated in                     the process that they had endeavoured to excite                     civil war. There was no difficulty in guessing that                     this proceeding was a farce, and that by                     overcharging the crime it was the intention of the                     government to favour the acquittal of the accused;                     and accordingly they were acquitted.]    It is calculated that the individuals who are interested directly or  indirectly either in the purchases of the national domains, or in the  rights and liabilities arising out of them, amount in number to  somewhat between nine and ten millions.    An opportunity offered itself when all the uneasiness felt by this  integral portion of the population of France might have been removed.  It was when the law; by which the emigrants recovered possession of  such part of their property as had not been alienated, came under  consideration. It was natural to suppose that the administration would  take advantage of the capability of the proceeding, in order to revive  the confidence of the public, and to renew the guarantee of the  charter. Such was not their conduct. On the contrary, M. Ferrand, the  government orator, one of the men who did most mischief to the King  and the kingdom, abandoned himself--we borrow the expression of the  reporter of the committee--to all the acrimony of his passions, and  all the profligacy of his principles. His fury could only be equalled  by his folly. He did not scruple to maintain, in the midst of the  representatives of the nation, that the emigrants had the greatest  right to claim the justice and favour of the royal government, because  they alone had not wandered from the righteous path. And starting with  this position, he represented the forfeiture and sale of their  property, not as the justifiable acts of a legislative body, but as  revolutionary outrages and robberies which the nation ought to hasten  to make good.    The Chamber of Deputies passed their censure upon the inflammatory  doctrines and language of the royalist orator, and expunged the word  \"restitution\" from the law. It had not been inserted without design,  for \"restitution\" supposes a previous robbery, and the emigrants had  not been robbed of the property: it had been confiscated by virtue of  a law sanctioned by the King; and which law was only a new application  of the system of confiscation created and followed up by the King's  predecessors.    Without travelling into more remote periods, we may ask if it was not  with the spoils of the victims who had been sacrificed to the  murderous policy of Richelieu, and the religious intolerance of Louis  XIV., that the first families had been enriched? And who can tell  whether the lands which the emigrants reclaimed with so much pride and  bitterness, were not the same which their ancestors had received  without a blush from the bloody hands of Richelieu and Louis?    It must be confessed that the unalterable fidelity of a certain number  amongst the emigrants bound the royal government to reward their  fidelity and to alleviate their misfortunes. But all had not an equal  right to the affection and gratitude of the King. If some had  generously sacrificed their fortunes and their country in the cause of  royalty, yet others only fled from France because they wished to  escape their creditors[11], and thought that in strange countries they  might find dupes to feed upon, and thus exist upon swindling resources  to which they could no longer resort with impunity at home.                       [Footnote 11: Before the revolution it was                     customary for \"_les grands seigneurs_\" to obtain                     what were called \"_lettres de surseance_,\" by means                     of which they avoided the payment of their debts,                     and defeated their creditors.]    It was therefore necessary to separate the first class of emigrants  from the last; and after establishing this distinction, the government  should have made a fair appeal to the justice and generosity of the  nation. Frenchmen, who yield so readily to every dignified sentiment,  would not have allowed the faithful and virtuous servants of their  King to languish in poverty. We may appeal to the universal assent  which was given to the proposal[12] made by the marshal duke of  Tarentum, that ten millions of francs should be annually appropriated  for the indemnification of the emigrants who had been deprived of  their property, and of the soldiers who had lost their \"_dotations_.\"                       [Footnote 12: This proposal was not carried into                     execution.]    But the government party should not have attempted to assist the  emigrants by resorting to means offensive to the nation, and  derogatory to the charter. And, above all, they should not have puffed  up the emigrants with proud and silly hopes. If they had been left to  themselves, they would have fallen in with the purchasers of their  property, they would have treated for an amicable settlement of their  claims, and they would have regained possession of their hereditary  estates without jarring and without scandal.    The partiality which was shown towards the emigrants on all occasions  produced another evil of still greater extent. It contributed, even  more than the efforts of disaffection, in persuading the peasantry  that the government wished to chain them again to the soil, and to  render them once more the tributaries both of the nobility and of the  priesthood.    The revolution has taught the countryman to know that he is somebody  in the state. After the revolution the peasants became rich, and they  were delivered from the double vassalage of former days, when they  crouched before the priest and the lord: therefore they could not  think of any alteration without horror. Day after day they heard or  they read (in France every body reads now,) that the government  intended to restore the \"_ancien regime_.\" And the restoration of the  \"_ancien regime_\" was interpreted by them, as well as by many others,  to mean the restoration of tithes, vassalage, and feudal rights. They  were confirmed in their dangerous and disquieting opinion by the  outrageous claims of the emigrants, and the declamations of the  priests. It was to no purpose that the government tried to re-assure  them. They had been already deceived and it seldom happens that you  can catch a French peasant twice in the same snare. The abolition of  the conscription had been promised, and the old code was continued in  force with all its harshness, and still the refractory conscripts were  sent away in chains, whilst fines were imposed upon their families.  The abolition of the \"_droits reunis_\" had also been promised, and  they were not only levied with greater rigour and harshness than  before, but even some of these imposts had been greatly increased.    Such was the fatality which influenced all the actions of the  government,"]]]
