[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19172"],[0,"An Australian in China (#8)"],[1,"the Commissioner of Customs is Dr. F. Hirth, whose Chinese  house is on the highest part of Chungking in front of a temple, which,  dimly seen through the mist, is the crowning feature of the city. A  distinguished sinologue is the doctor, one of the finest Chinese  scholars in the Empire, author of \"China and the Roman Orient,\" \"Ancient  Porcelain,\" and an elaborate \"Textbook of Documentary Chinese,\" which is  in the hands of most of the Customs staff in China, for whose assistance  it was specially written. Dr. Hirth is a German who has been many years  in China. He holds the third button, the transparent blue button, the  third rank in the nine degrees by which Chinese Mandarins are  distinguished.    The best site in Chungking has been fortunately secured by the Methodist  Episcopalian Mission of the United States. Their missionaries dwell with  great comfort in the only foreign-built houses in the city in a large  compound with an ample garden. Their Mission hospital is a well-equipped  Anglo-Chinese building attached to the city wall, and overlooking from  its lofty elevation the Little River, and the walled city beyond it.    The wards of the hospital are comfortable and well lit; the floors are  varnished; the beds are provided with spring mattresses; indeed, in the  comfort of the hospital the Chinese find its chief discomfort. A  separate compartment has been walled off for the treatment of  opium-smokers who desire by forced restraint to break off the habit.  Three opium-smokers were in durance at the time of my visit; they were  happy and contented and well nourished, and none but the trained eye of  an expert, who saw what he wished to see, could have guessed that they  were addicted to the use of a drug which has been described in  exaggerated terms as \"more deadly to the Chinese than war, famine, and  pestilence combined.\" (Rev. A. H. Smith, \"Chinese Characteristics,\" p.  187.)    Not long ago three men were admitted into the hospital suffering, on  their own confession, from the opium habit. They freely expressed the  desire of their hearts to be cured, and were received with welcome and  placed in confinement. Every effort was made to wean them from the habit  which, they alleged, had \"seized them in a death grip.\" Attentive to the  teacher and obedient to the doctor, they gave every hope of being early  admitted into Church fellowship. But one night the desire to return to  the drug became irresistible, and, strangely, the desire attacked all  three men at the same time on the same night; and they escaped together.  Sadly enough there was in this case marked evidence of the demoralising  influence of opium, for when they escaped they took with them everything  portable that they could lay their hands on. It was a sad trial.    Excellent medical work is done in the hospital. From the first annual  report just published by the surgeon in charge, an M.D. from the United  States, I extract the two following pleasing items.    _Medical Work._--\"Mr. Tsang Taotai, of Kuei-Iang-fu, was an eye witness  to several operations, as well as being operated upon for Internal  Piles\" (the last words in large capitals).    _Evangelistic Work._--\"Mrs. Wei, in the hospital for suppurating glands  of the neck, became greatly interested in the truth while there, left a  believer, and attends Sunday service regular (_sic_), walking from a  distant part of the city each Sunday. We regard her as very hopeful, and  she is reported by the Chinese as being very warm-hearted. She will be  converted when the first vacancy occurs in the nursing staff.\"    During my stay in Chungking I frequently met the French Consul \"_en  commission_,\" Monsieur Haas, who had lately arrived on a diplomatic  mission, which was invested with much secrecy. It was believed to have  for its object the diversion of the trade of Szechuen from its natural  channel, the Yangtse River, southward through Yunnan province to  Tonquin. Success need not be feared to attend his mission. \"_Ils  perdront et leur temps et leur argent._\" Monsieur Haas has helped to  make history in his time. The most gentle-mannered of men, he writes  with strange rancour against the perfidious designs of Britain in the  East. In his diplomatic career Monsieur Haas suffered one great  disappointment. He was formerly the French Charge d'Affaires and  Political Resident at the court of King Theebaw in Mandalay. And it was  his \"Secret Treaty\" with the king which forced the hand of England and  led to her hasty occupation of Upper Burma. The story is a very pretty  one. By this treaty French influence was to become predominant in Upper  Burma; the country was to become virtually a colony of France, with a  community of interest with France, with France to support her in any  difficulty with British Burma. Such a position England could not  tolerate for one moment. Fortunately for us French intrigue outwitted  itself, and the Secret Treaty became known. It was in this way. Draft  copies of the agreement drawn up in French and Burmese were exchanged  between Monsieur Haas and King Theebaw. But Monsieur Haas could not read  Burmese, and he distrusted the King. A trusted interpreter was  necessary, and there was only one man in Mandalay that seemed to him  sufficiently trustworthy. To Signor A---- then, the Italian Charge  d'Affaires and Manager of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, Monsieur Haas  went and, pledging him to secrecy, sought his assistance as interpreter.    As Monsieur Haas had done, so did his Majesty the King. Two great minds  were being guided by the same spirit. Theebaw could not read French, and  he distrusted Monsieur Haas. An interpreter was essential, and, casting  about for a trusted one, he decided that no one could serve him so  faithfully as Signor A----, and straightway sought his assistance, as  Monsieur Haas had done. Their fates were in his hands; which master  should the Italian serve, the French or the Burmese? He did not  hesitate--he betrayed them both. Within an hour the Secret Treaty was in  possession of the British Resident. Action was taken with splendid  promptitude. \"M. de Freycinet, when pressed on the subject, repudiated  any intention of acquiring for France a political predominance in  Burma.\" An immediate pretext was found to place Theebaw in a dilemma;  eleven days later the British troops had crossed the frontier, and Upper  Burma was another province of our Indian Empire.    Monsieur Haas was recalled, and his abortive action repudiated. He had  acted, of course, without orders, he had erred from too much zeal.  Signor A---- was also recalled, but did not go because the order was not  accompanied with the customary cheque to defray the cost of his passage.  His services to England were rewarded, and he retained his engagement as  Manager of the Flotilla Company; but he lost his appointment as the  Representative of Italy--an honourable post with a dignified salary paid  by the Italian Government in I.O.U.'s.    Chungking is an enormously rich city. It is built at the junction of the  Little River and the Yangtse, and is, from its position, the great river  port of the province of Szechuen. Water-ways stretch from here an  immense distance inland. The Little River is little only in comparison  with the Yangtse, and in any other country would be regarded as a mighty  inland river. It is navigable for more than 2000 li (600 miles). The  Yangtse drains a continent; the Little River drains a province larger  than a European kingdom. Chungking is built at a great height above the  present river, now sixty feet below its summer level. Its walls are  unscalable. Good influences are directed over the city from a lofty  pagoda on the topmost hill in the vicinity. Temples abound, and spacious  yamens and rich buildings, the crowning edifice of all being the Temple  to the God of Literature. Distances are prodigious in Chungking, and the  streets so steep and hilly, with flights of stairs cut from the solid  rock, that only a mountaineer can live here in comfort. All who can  afford it go in chairs; stands of sedan chairs are at every important  street corner.    [Illustration: A TEMPLE THEATRE IN CHUNGKING.]    During the day the city vibrates with teeming traffic; at night the  streets are deserted and dead, the stillness only disturbed by a  distant watchman springing his bamboo rattle to keep himself awake and  warn robbers of his approach. In no city in Europe is security to life  and property better guarded than in this, or, indeed, in any other  important city in China. It is a truism to say that no people are more  law-abiding than the Chinese; \"they appear,\" says Medhurst, \"to maintain  order as if by common consent, independent of all surveillance.\"    Our Consul in Chungking is Mr. E. H. Fraser, an accomplished Chinese  scholar, who fills a difficult post with rare tact and complete success.  Consul Fraser estimates the population of Chungking at 200,000; the  Chinese, he says, have a record of 35,000 families within the walls. Of  this number from forty to fifty per cent. of all men, and from four to  five per cent. of all women, indulge in the opium pipe. The city abounds  in opium-shops--shops, that is, where the little opium-lamps and the  opium-pipes are stacked in hundreds upon hundreds. Opium is one of the  staple products of this rich province, and one of the chief sources of  wealth of this flourishing city.    During the nine months that I was in China I saw thousands of  opium-smokers, but I never saw one to whom could be applied that  description by Lay (of the British and Foreign Bible Society), so often  quoted, of the typical opium-smoker in China \"with his lank and  shrivelled limbs, tottering gait, sallow visage, feeble voice, and  death-boding glance of eye, proclaiming him the most forlorn creature  that treads upon the ground.\"    This fantastic description, paraded for years past for our sympathy, can  be only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#8)"],[1,"of wood, and it  should not be larger than the size mentioned; a larger quantity can be  reduced, but of course more time will be required, and the experiment  cannot be so neatly performed.           *       *       *       *       *      HOW TO BUILD A CHIMNEY.    MESSRS. EDITORS:--I am satisfied that a great many fires originate  through poorly constructed chimneys; and, although not a bricklayer  by trade, I would offer a few hints how to construct a fire-proof  chimney. Let the bed be laid of brick and mortar, iron, or stone; then  the workman should take a brick in his left hand, and with the trowel,  draw the mortar upon the end of the brick, from the under side, and  not from the outside edge, as is usual. Then, by pressing the brick  against the next one, the whole space between the two bricks will be  filled with mortar; and so he should point up the inside as perfectly  as the outside, as he proceeds.    By drawing the mortar on the edge of the brick, the space between  the ends will not always be entirely filled, and will make (where the  inside pointing is not attended to) a leaky and unsafe chimney, which,  if not kept clear of soot, will, in burning out, stand a good chance  of setting the building on fire. The best thing that I know of, to  put the fire out in a burning chimney is salt; but the matter of first  importance, after having a chimney properly constructed, is to keep it  clean.    AUSTIN B.

EDITORS:--Please allow me to say to the querist who, through  your columns, asks what to do with crystalline honey, that if he will  \"doctor\" it with almost any artificial honey of the day, it will not  become like lard in cold weather, which change is a natural proof that  it is pure. For almost any purpose, pure honey is preferable to that  which has been adulterated, but purity is a minor consideration with  many.    Next we shall hear of some fastidious customer who objects to pure  lard, because it looks white when cold. To such we would recommend  lard oil as a great improvement, especially for cooking purposes.    A. M. B.

At a depth of fifteen feet, we were about to suspend our labors,  supposing from the nature and uniformly dark color of the earth,  that we had reached the surface of the alluvium, when a sign of the  inevitable wood and bark layer was seen in a crevice. An excavation,  five or six feet, into the wall, revealed the skeleton of a man laid  at length, having an extra coverlid of wooden material. Eighteen large  oblong beads, an ax of polished green stone, eleven arrow points, and  five implements of bone (to be described) were deposited on the  left side; and a few small beads, an ornamental shell pin, two small  hatchets, and a sharp-pointed flint knife or lance, eight inches long,  having a neck or projection at the base, suitable for a handle, or for  insertion in a shaft, on the right side. The earth behind the skull  being removed, three enormous conch shells presented their open  mouths. One of my assistants started back as if the ghost of the  departed had come to claim the treasure preserved, in accordance with  superstitious notions, for its journey to the \"happy lands.\" The alarm  seemed to be a warning, for at the moment the embankment, overloaded  on one side, caved in, nearly burying three workmen, myself, and a  spectator. Our tools being at the bottom of the heap, and the wall on  the other side, shaken by the falling earth, giving tokens of a change  of base, our prospects of a ready deliverance were not very hopeful.  The bystanders, however, went to work with their hands, and we were  soon relieved, not without casualty, the spectator having the worst of  it. Struggling to extricate himself, instead of abiding his time, he  dragged one leg out of the pile shorter than the other.    The occurrence of marine shells in a burial depository, especially of  the varieties pyrula and oliva, four or five hundred miles from the  Gulf and that portion of the Southern coast where the mollusks exist,  bears upon the question of migration and tribal intercourse, and  the commercial value of these articles. Obtained from a distance and  regarded as precious commodities, they were used in exchange, for the  material of ornaments, and for choice utensils. Only two or three of  these shells have been found in a perfect condition, but defective  ones are frequent, with fragments, \"cuttings,\" and various trinkets  made out of them--such as ornamental pins, needles, crosses, buttons,  amulets, engraved plates, and beads. From one of the specimens  recovered from the mound sepulchre, the spire and columella had been  removed, leaving a hollow utensil. It would have been suitable for  a water vessel, but for a hole in the bottom, which had furnished a  button-shaped ornament, or piece of money, which was found with the  relic, and exactly corresponded to the orifice. The twirled end of the  shell, however, had been improved for a handle by shallow cavities,  one on the inside slanting from the middle longitudinal line, and one  crossing that line at right angles on the convex side, so as to be  fitted to the thumb and fore finger of the left hand, suggesting a use  of the implement as a shield, or a mask held before the face. Adair  speaks of large shells in use by the Indians of his time (1735),  suspended about the neck for shields, and regarded as badges of  priestly dignity.    A trench was dug on the east side of the mound, nearly corresponding  in dimensions to the one on the west side, making the length of the  whole excavation, including the central cavity, thirty-two feet.    In the last opening, eight skeletons were exhumed; the mode of burial  was the same throughout. The only article of value recovered was a  curiously wrought pipe of stone, having a \"figure head\" representing  the human face, which I have put down in a list of \"articles stolen,\"  and which the thief can describe better than the writer. After filling  up all the gaps, and levelling the surface to suit the taste of the  proprietor, we closed our labors on the mound in the Bent.    Of the skulls collected, it is sufficient to say that they belong to  the \"short heads,\" the length and breadth having a comparative medium  proportion, a common form of cranium in the mounds of Tennessee.    Of stone implements I specify an ax of serpentine, ten inches long,  two thick, and four broad, having plain sides and a straight edge  ground down on both of the flat faces; hatchets (\"tomahawks\") of  green stone, flint, and diorite, from five to eight inches long, with  rounded faces and sides, contracted to an edge at one end, and to a  flat heel at the other; a wedge of black slate, seven inches long and  half an inch thick, of a square finish on the faces and sides and at  the heel, which was diminished two inches, as compared with the length  of the edge; hatchets with a serrated edge at each end, plane on both  sides, convex on one face and flat on the other.    With one skeleton was deposited a \"set of tools,\" eight in number, of  the species of rock before mentioned, varying in length from two to  eight inches. Their peculiarity consists in a variety of shapes--no  two being precisely alike--and in their fitness to various uses,  such as carving, hacking, paring, and grooving. The smallest of them,  having a square finish, was held by the thumb and two fingers, and is  suitable for cutting lines and figures in wood and shells. Specimens  of this art were furnished from the mound. The largest number might  serve for hatchets, chisels, and gouges. One had been ground in the  form of a cylinder five inches long and an inch thick, and then cut  an inch on two sides to an edge, and worked into a handle with a round  bead, from the center of the elliptical faces. It might be used for  chipping wood and stone. One answered the purpose of a cold chisel;  another was somewhat similar, but had a hollow face reduced to a  curved edge for grooving. These polished instruments, wrought with  much care, seemed intended for use by the hand rather than for  insertion in a handle or socket, or attachment to a shaft by means  of a strap or withe. Only one was perforated. The drilling through  granite, quartz, and diorite, without the use of metal, was a severe  labor, even for savage patience. A long knife of silex, with a wrought  handle, lance heads, leaf shaped, of the same material, of beautiful  workmanship, arrow points of fine finish, furnished, with others  before mentioned, an assortment of arms. Several flint points, though  only an inch long, were curved like a cimeter, and used probably as  flaying instruments. True disks, of various mineral substances, from  an inch to five inches in diameter, having convex faces, complete the  list of stone implements. Those of bone comprise several like hollow  chisels, sharpened at one end, and pierced through one face, near the  other extremity, so as to be fastened to a handle; these were used  for dressing skins. One was formed like a poniard, with a worked hilt.  With these may be connected arrow heads and sharp pointed weapons of  the worked antlers of the stag, and tusks of the wild boar.    Of ornaments, I noticed pins used for dressing the hair, made of the  columns of large sea shells. The head is generally round, sometimes  oval, from an eighth to a half of an inch in diameter, retaining the  diagonal groove of the pillar from which it is made. The stems vary  in length from one to six inches. It would be tedious even to classify  ornamental beads and buttons of shell work, such as are usually found  in the mounds. These trinkets are perforated, and, in addition to  their being articles of dress, were used probably as \"wam"]]]
