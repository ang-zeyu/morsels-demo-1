A seed in the beginning is very small, but in the end a great tree.  One should not consider the seed, but the tree and its abundance of  blossoms, leaves and fruits.    Consider the days of Jesus, when there was only a small body of people,  and then observe the great tree which grew from that seed and what an  abundant fruit it produced. This is greater than that, forasmuch as it is  the calling of the Lord of Hosts and the Voice of the Trumpet of the  Living God; it is the summons unto the harmony and unison of the world,  and it is the banner of faithfulness, trustworthiness and friendship among  the difference nations and sects of the universe; it is the light of the  Sun of Truth and the spirituality of the Majestic One. Verily this great  cycle (dispensation) will encompass all the horizons and ultimately all  the nations will gather together under this standard.    Therefore, know the importance of this seed which was planted in the  divine field by the heavenly Gardener, watered with the rain of grace and  nurtured by the heat and light of the Sun of Truth. Thus, O ye friends of  God, give thanks unto His Majesty, the One, that ye became (or were made)  the manifestation of such a gift and the recipient of such favor.    Blessed are ye! Good-tidings unto you for this great blessing!          \"O ye who are sincere! O ye who are firm in the Covenant...\"      O ye who are sincere! O ye who are firm in the Covenant of God in this new  cycle!    Verily I praise God for that He confirmed you in the service of the Cause  of God in His great vineyard.    Write to Mrs. ........ and convey to her greetings and praise and say to  her that her Lord will aid and strengthen her in attaining her desire.    Convey my greeting and salutation unto the maidservant of God, the  attracted one, Mrs. ........, the respected. I ask God to make her a  spreader of the new Gospel, an utterer in praise of her Lord in that vast  region.    Convey my kindness and love unto the maid-servant of God, who is thrilled  by the fragrances of God, Miss ........ of [that place] so that she may be  rejoiced by my greeting to her, the fullness of my favor, and that she may  be drawn by the love of God even as the magnet attracts the iron.    O my precious friends in the Kingdom of God, the members of the Spiritual  Meeting! Communicate with all parts of Persia; write replies to the  letters which are sent to you, with all joy, happiness, fragrance and  spirituality; because the friends of God in Persia are all rejoiced in  commemorating you in the meetings and assemblies, in houses and  Mashrak-el-Azcars.(13)          \"O ye who are attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O ye who are attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily I read your letters which uttered your steadfastness in the Cause  of God, your firmness in His Religion and your joy by the breezes wafted  from the garden of the Kingdom of God.    The truth, I say unto you, \"Verily, the Supreme Concourse utter praise  upon you, because ye forsook the desires of self, were illumined by the  light of guidance, clothed yourselves with the garment of sanctity and  called in the Name of El-Abha among the people. Verily, ye shall reap what  ye sow and obtain the fruits of what ye plant. This is a pre-ordained  fact.\"    O ye beloved of God! When the winds blow severely, rains fall fiercely,  the lightning flashes, the thunder roars, the bold descends and storms of  trial become severe, grieve not; for after this storm, verily, the divine  spring will arrive, the hills and fields will become verdant, the expanses  of grain will joyfully wave, the earth will become covered with blossoms,  the trees will be clothed with green garments and adorned with blossoms  and fruits. Thus blessings become manifest in all countries. These favors  are results of those storms and hurricanes.    The discerning man rejoiceth at the day of trials, his breast becometh  dilated at the time of severe storms, his eyes become brightened when  seeing the showers of rain and gusts of wind, whereby trees are uprooted;  because he foreseeth the result and the end (of these trials), the leaves,  blossoms and fruits (which follow this wintry storm); while the ignorant  (short-sighted) person becometh troubled when he seeth a storm, is  saddened when it raineth severely, is terrified by the thunder and  trembleth at the surging of the waves which storm the shores.    As ye have heard of the former times, when (for example) Christ--glory be  to Him! --appeared, a storm of trials arose, afflictions appeared, the  winds of tests blew, the thunder of temptation descended and hosts of  people (Pharisees) surrounded the houses of the friends; then the weak  ones were shaken and were misled after once being guided; but the  disciples withstood the hardships and endured the storms of ordeals,  remaining firm in the Religion of God. Then observe that which occurred  after the storm and what appeared subsequent to that severity, whereby the  members (followers) trembled.    God hath changed the sorrow to joy, the destructive darkness of calamity  into the shining light from the Supreme Concourse. The people at the  beginning persecuted and reviled the believers in God and said of them:  \"These are the people of aberration.\" Then, when their light appeared,  their stars shone and their lamps illuminated, the people returned into  love and affinity; they prayed to them, offered words of glory night and  day (in their name) and remembered them in eulogy, reverence, honor and  majesty.    Therefore, O ye beloved of God, be not grieved when people stand against  you, persecute you, afflict and trouble you and say all manner of evil  against you. The darkness will pass away and the light of the manifest  signs will appear, the veil will be withdrawn and the Light of Reality  will shine forth from the unseen [Kingdom] of El-Abha. This we inform you  before it occurs, so that when the hosts of people arise against you for  my love, be not disturbed or troubled; nay, rather, be firm as a mountain,  for this persecution and reviling of the people upon you is a pre-ordained  matter. Blessed is the soul who is firm in the path!          \"O thou servant of God!...\"      O thou servant(14) of God!    ***Trust no man save him whose breast hath been dilated by God through the  light of faith, whom God hath confirmed in His Religion, and who is  severed from all else save God and attracted by His Fragrances.    In future, of course, certain people will come to you claiming faith; do  not believe them nor trust them, unless after critical examination, search  and investigation, and a long period of waiting, they shall appear to be  faithful and truthful in word, confident in heart, attracted in spirit,  pure in intention, patient in hardship, enduring the most severe tests;  then associate with them. Because some sects will send certain men to  mingle with you in order to throw suspicion upon those who are weak,  therefore avoid them carefully.*** But let such [deliberations] be hidden  that you may not become a cause of hindrance [to such souls].(15)          \"O ye firm ones in the Covenant!...\"      O ye firm ones in the Covenant!    The report of [your meeting] was noted. All the arrangements of the  meeting are suitable and acceptable. The reading of the Tablets which are  sent to special persons dependeth upon their consent. First send the  Tablets to them and if they should agree, the same may be read in the  meeting. All the arrangements were good and suitable.    A special letter is enclosed for the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........  Forward it. As to letters for Chicago and its vicinity, if God so willeth  (Inshallah), they will be sent through the House of Spirituality. As to  the copying of the Tablets in a book for the House of Spirituality, this  dependeth upon the consent of the receivers of the Tablets. If the owners  of the Tablets consent, copies should be kept and collected in the House  of Spirituality and it will be acceptable. Nevertheless, this should be  with perfect consent of the receivers.    Regarding arrangements for the Bahai Sunday meeting for the purpose of  worship, this is very suitable. But, in a meeting for worship, first,  prayer should be chanted and supplication made until all gather; then  communion should be made. After praying, sacred readings with melodious  voices should be read by all together. As this is the commencement of  holding meetings, this is sufficient.          \"O God! O God!...\"      O God! O God!(16)    Thou dost look upon us from Thine unseen Kingdom of Oneness, [beholding]  that we have assembled in this Spiritual Meeting, believing in Thee,  confident in Thy signs, firm in Thy Covenant and Testament, attracted unto  Thee, set aglow with the fire of Thy love, sincere in Thy Cause, servants  in Thy vineyard, spreaders of They Religion, worshipers of Thy  Countenance, humble to Thy beloved, submissive at Thy door and imploring  Thee to confirm us in the service of Thy chosen ones. Support us with  Thine unseen hosts, strengthen our loins in Thy servitude and make us  submissive and worshiping servants, communing with Thee.    O our Lord! Turn our faces unto Thy divine face; feed us from Thy heavenly  table by Thy godly grace; help us through the hosts of Thy supreme angles  and confirm us by the holy ones of the Kingdom of Abha.    Verily Thou art the Generous, the Merciful! Thou art possessor of great  bounty and verily Thou art the Clement and Gracious!          \"O ye who are attracted! O ye who are firm! O ye...\"      O ye who are attracted! O ye who are firm! O ye who are zealous in the  service of the Cause of God and are sacrificers of possessions and lives  for the promotion of the Word of God!    I perused your recent letter, dated *** and my heart was filled with joy  through its beautify meanings and its eloquent contents."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,":--      Admiral de Robeck,    Admiral Wemyss,    General Birdwood,    General Braithwaite,    Captain Pollen,    Myself.    The moment we sat down de Robeck told us _he was now quite clear he  could not get through without the help of all my troops_.    Before ever we went aboard Braithwaite, Birdwood and I had agreed that,  whatever we landsmen might think, we must leave the seamen to settle  their own job, saying nothing for or against land operations or  amphibious operations until the sailors themselves turned to us and said  they had abandoned the idea of forcing the passage by naval operations  alone.    They have done so. The fat (that is us) is fairly in the fire.    No doubt we had our views. Birdie and my own Staff disliked the idea of  chancing mines with million pound ships. The hesitants who always make  hay in foul weather had been extra active since the sinking of the three  men-of-war. Suppose the Fleet _could_ get through with the loss of  another battleship or two--how the devil would our troopships be able to  follow? And the store ships? And the colliers?    This had made me turn contrary. During the battle I had cabled that the  chances of the Navy pushing through on their own were hardly fair  fighting chances, but, since then, de Robeck, the man who should know,  had said twice that he _did_ think there was a fair fighting chance. Had  he stuck to that opinion at the conference, then I was ready, as a  soldier, to make light of military croaks about troopships.  Constantinople must surrender, revolt or scuttle within a very few hours  of our battleships entering the Marmora. Memories of one or two obsolete  six inchers at Ladysmith helped me to feel as Constantinople would feel  when her rail and sea communications were cut and a rain of shell fell  upon the penned-in populace from de Robeck's terrific batteries. Given a  good wind that nest of iniquity would go up like Sodom and Gomorrah in a  winding sheet of flame.    But once the Admiral said his battleships could not fight through  without help, there was no foothold left for the views of a landsman.    So there was no discussion. At once we turned our faces to the land  scheme. Very sketchy; how could it be otherwise? On the German system  plans for a landing on Gallipoli would have been in my pocket,  up-to-date and worked out to a ball cartridge and a pail of water. By  the British system (?) I have been obliged to concoct my own plans in a  brace of shakes almost under fire. Strategically and tactically our  method may have its merits, for though it piles everything on to one  man, the Commander, yet he is the chap who has got to see it through.  But, in matters of supply, transport, organisation and administration  our way is the way of Colney Hatch.    Here am I still minus my Adjutant-General; my Quartermaster-General and  my Medical Chief, charged with settling the basic question of whether  the Army should push off from Lemnos or from Alexandria. Nothing in the  world to guide me beyond my own experience and that of my Chief of the  General Staff, whose sphere of work and experience lies quite outside  these administrative matters. I can see that Lemnos is practically  impossible; I fix on Alexandria in the light of Braithwaite's advice and  my own hasty study of the map. Almost incredible really, we should have  to decide so tremendous an administrative problem off the reel and  without any Administrative Staff. But time presses, the responsibility  cannot be shirked, and so I have cabled K. that Lemnos must be a  wash-out and that I am sending my troops to get ship-shape at Alexandria  although, thereby, I upset every previous arrangement. Then I have had  to cable for Engineers, trench mortars, bombs, hand grenades,  periscopes. Then again, seeing things are going less swimmingly than K.  had thought they would, I have had to harden my heart against his horror  of being asked for more men and have decided to cable for leave to bring  over from Egypt a Brigade of Gurkhas to complete Birdwood's New Zealand  Division. Last, and worst, I have had to risk the fury of the Q.M.G. to  the Forces by telling the War Office that their transports are so loaded  (water carts in one ship; water cart horses in another; guns in one  ship; limbers in another; entrenching tools anyhow) that they must be  emptied and reloaded before we can land under fire.    These points were touched upon at the Conference. I told them too that  my Intelligence folk fix the numbers of the enemy now at the Dardanelles  as 40,000 on the Gallipoli Peninsula with a reserve of 30,000 behind  Bulair: on the Asiatic side of the Straits there are at least a  Division, but there _may_ be several Divisions. The Admiral's  information tallies and, so Birdie says, does that of the Army in Egypt.  The War Office notion that the guns of the Fleet can sweep the enemy off  the tongue of the Peninsula from Achi Baba Southwards is moonshine. My  trump card turns out to be the Joker; best of all cards only it don't  happen to be included in this particular pack!    As ideas for getting round this prickly problem were passing through my  mind, two suggestions for dealing with it were put forward. The sailors  say some lighters were being built, and probably by now are built, for  the purpose of a landing in the North: they would carry five hundred  men; had bullet-proof bulwarks and are to work under their own gas  engines. If I can possibly get a petition for these through to Winston  we would very likely be lent some and with their aid the landing under  fire will be child's play to what it will be otherwise. But the cable  must get to Winston: if it falls into the hands of Fisher it fails, as  the sailors tell me he is obsessed by the other old plan and grudges us  every rope's end or ha'porth of tar that finds its way out here.    Rotten luck to have cut myself off from wiring to Winston: still I see  no way out of it: with K. jealous as a tiger--what can I do? Also,  although the sailors want me to pull this particular chestnut out of the  fire, it is just as well they should know I am not going to speak to  their Boss even under the most tempting circs.: but they won't cable  themselves: frightened of Fisher: so I then and there drafted this to K.  from myself:--    \"Our first step of landing under fire will be the most critical as well  as the most vital of the whole operations. If the Admiralty will  improvise and send us out post haste 20 to 30 large lighters difficulty  and duration of this phase will be cut down to at least one half. The  lighters should each be capable of conveying 400 to 500 men or 30 to 40  horses. They should be protected by bullet-proof armour.\"    Everyone agreed but Birdwood pointed out that, by sending this message,  we implied in so many words, that we would not land until the lighters  came out from England. He assumed that we had definitely turned down any  plan of scrambling ashore forthwith, as best we could? I said, \"Yes,\"  and that the Navy were with me in that view, a statement confirmed by de  Robeck and Wemyss who nodded their heads. Birdwood said he only wanted  to be quite clear about it, and there the matter dropped.    Actually I had thought a lot about that possibility. To a man of my  temperament there was every temptation to have a go in and revenge the  loss of the battleships forthwith. We might sup to-morrow night on Achi  Baba. With luck we really might. Had I been here for ten days instead of  five, and had I had any time to draft out any sort of scheme, I might  have had a dart. But the operation of landing in face of an enemy is the  most complicated and difficult in war. Under existing conditions the  whole attempt would be partial, _decousu_, happy-go-lucky to the last  degree. There are no small craft to speak of. There is no provision for  carrying water. There is no information _at all_ about springs or wells  ashore. There is no arrangement for getting off the wounded and my  Principal Medical Officer and his Staff won't be here for a fortnight.  My orders against piecemeal occupation are specific. But the 29th  Division is our _piece de resistance_ and it won't be here, we  reckon--not complete--for another three weeks.    All the same, I might chance it, for, by taking all these off chances we  _might_ pull off the main chance of stealing a march upon the Turks.  What puts me off is not the chances of war but the certainties of  commonsense. If I did so handle my troops on the spot as to sup on Achi  Baba to-morrow night, I still could not counter the inevitable reaction  of numbers, time and space. The Turks would have at least a fortnight to  concentrate their whole force against my half force; to defeat them and  then to defy the other half.    I must wait for the 29th Division. By the time they come I can get  things straight for a smashing simultaneous blow and I am resolved that,  so far as in me lies, the orders and preparations will then be so  thoroughly worked out--so carefully rehearsed as to give every chance to  my men.[6]    If the 29th Division were here--or near at hand--I could balance  shortage against the obvious evils of giving the Turks time to reinforce  and to dig. Could I hope for the 29th Division within a week it might be  worth my while to fly in the face of K. by grasping the Peninsula firmly  by her toe: or,--had my staff and self been here ten days ago, we could  have already got well forward with our plans and orders, as well as with  the laying of our hands upon the thousand odds and ends demanded by the  invasion of a barren, trackless extremity of an Empire--odds and ends  never thought of by anyone until the spur of reality brought them  galloping to the front. Then the moment the Fleet cried off, we might  have had a dash in, right away, with what we have here. The onslaught  could have been supported from Egypt and the 29th Division might have  been treated as a"]]]
