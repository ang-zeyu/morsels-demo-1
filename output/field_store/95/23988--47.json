Meantime I watch the lascars taking off the effect of the coaling last  night; how blue and sharp the reflections of the sky are on the wet deck  and their dark feet. It is my business to paint things, not to write,  about them, still, both occupations dissipate the time wonderfully. They  are scrubbing down the waist, washing the decks with brushes and  squeejees and lashins of blue Mediterranean; they wear dungaree tunics,  and trousers of dark blue and faded pale blues, with red cloth round  their straw skull-caps, and are all in shadow--that colourful, melting,  warm shade you have in the South in the afternoon.    27th Evening.--To what shall I liken this evening on deck? You know a  railway carriage on Bank Holiday, and you have heard perhaps of a  Newfoundland sealing ship, the crew head and tail and three deep in the  bunks, and all about the deck and along the bulwarks for want of  room--well, it's worse here, at the price! In the smoking-room there is  not an inch to sit on; men lean against the pillars, others against the  side of the bar or against each other. A few have got seats for bridge,  others sit on sofas round the side, the rest have to stand. There were  more passengers when we left Tilbury than allowed any free movement on  deck; we made light of that. Now, people are jammed beside each other  all the way up the side of the deck that is sheltered from the sweep of  the wind, others sit on the rail; those who want to move have to pick a  devious and careful course between the lines of chairs. And this is to  be to-night, and to-morrow, till we get to India! And it will yet be  worse than it is just now, for many passengers from Marseilles are still  below, waiting for baths and arranging their crowded cabins.    I have to write letters and sketch on a dining-saloon table amongst  waiters clearing dishes. There are four small tables on deck in what I  think is called the music room, and they are fully occupied with ladies  writing and bridge players, and round them every seat in the room is  occupied. It is a crowd of people of the most gentle manners and  breeding, or it would be horrible beyond words.    [Illustration]    28th.--I suppose there were not more than fifty men in the smoking-room  late last night when it became sufficiently empty to allow me to see  separate faces. There were civilians, judges, and one or two men of  business, but the majority were soldiers of middle age. I confess I am  much impressed by the general type and the expression of quiet strength  and capability of these men of the Indian Services. They have finely  modelled heads on powerful figures, better, I think, than any type of  the ancients. Their manners are cheery and kindly, but always in repose  the lines show strongly across the brow; faces and lines seem to me to  spell D-U-T-Y emphatically. For a _nouveau_ it is difficult to follow  their talk, it changes so quickly from the man to his horse, to his seat  and powers as cavalry leader or the like, perhaps to his family, his  marriage, or his death, and whenever the family interest comes in, there  is a note of genuine kindness as if brothers were telling or asking  about other brothers and their wives and belongings. They speak rather  quickly and cheerily, and then in repose the lines come again, not that  they look over-worn; on the contrary they look fit, tremendously and are  very abstemious. One speaks near me--\"You knew so and so? Good  horseman--wasn't he? Curious seat--do you remember the way he rode with  his toes out?\" \"Yes, yes--ha, ha!--it was funny! He led a column with me  at Abu Lassin. Very sad his death, poor fellow--never got over the last  war--heart always suffered--nice wife.\" \"Yes, yes--gave him pretty bad  time though--oughtn't to have married. Where is his boy--Sandhurst? No,  he's left--he's coming out next month in a troop ship, I hear.\" These  are the older soldiers, and there are also many young officers, and two  judges of the High Courts, one with nimble tongue and expression, the  other the reverse. And there are business men with concentrated and  perhaps rather narrower expressions than the others--Irish, Scots, and  English. As they are all in the same black and white kit in the evening  it is easier then to compare the various faces; in the daytime the  variety of costume, flannels, and coloured ties and tweeds prevent one  doing it so easily; I'd like to make a sketch of each, and superimpose  these, and get the average, the type of the thousands who follow this  road year after year.    ... As usual, these Bayards, in dressing gowns of various cuts and  colours, stood outside the bathrooms this morning and waited their turn,  and if the atmosphere was not murky with swear words, it was not to the  P. & O.'s credit. To most men tub time is the jolliest in the day; here  it is one of evil temper, for after you have waited say twenty minutes  in a passage for your chance, you get into a little wet steamy place  over the engines, with possibly no port and poorly ventilated, and have  your tub in a hurry for you know other fellows are waiting outside, and  instead of gaily carolling your morning song you feel angry and cuss  cusses, not loud, but profound as Tuscarora Deep. \"Oh! Mummie, do come  and see all the men waiting for their baths,\" said a little angel this  morning, as she pointed at the solemn row of bare-footed men holding on  to their towels and sponge-bags and tempers--we actually grinned. Like  some others I give up the attempt to get a morning tub, and trust to  sneak one in during the day; better to have no bath than to start the  day cross--\"better to smash your damned clubs than to lose your damned  temper,\" as the golfer in a bunker was overheard muttering as he broke  each club across his knee. The ladies, some hundreds, have I think five  baths between them, and they wait for these a great part of the day. If  you pass their waiting-room you get a glimpse of wonderful morning  toilettes of every tint, muslins, laces, a black boy with red turbash  bustling about to get the bath ready makes rather a good note of colour.    ... Notwithstanding all the above grievance we hadn't such a bad day  yesterday; it was calm and not too cold, with a soft pigeon grey sea and  sky.... Put in a long day's painting in the corner of the after-well,  and overhauling sketches done so far on the road--they are mounting up  now, and I feel fortunate in having my apology for existence in such a  handy shape as a paint box.    But how dull this log-writing becomes! How on earth can I find an  incident to pad up this journal; what is there to write about in a route  so monotonously first class! Here is absolutely the most risque exciting  story I have heard for days; I must say the lady who told it has such an  infectious laugh, that at the time I really thought it was very amusing.    You know the cabins on the P. & O. steamers are all exactly like each  other, except the number above each door. So once upon a time she  related, a certain lady tripped along to her cabin as she thought, to  hurry up her husband for dinner and found him pulling on a shirt; she  plumped into a seat, saying, \"John, John, you are always too late for  dinner, and there's no use trying to struggle into your shirt with the  studs fastened?\" Whereon the neck stud flew and revealed an astonished  face--and it was not \"John's.\" After lunch I told this to my barrister  acquaintance; he smiled gently and said he had always thought it such an  amusing story.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    How I wish I was back at sea again on a whaler, with a swinging hammock,  a tow net, and microscope, and opportunities any day to study the fairy  beauties in drops of sea water, and with human interest too, so much  more varied than on this P. & O. Hotel; there, would be all kinds of  men, jolly, devil-may-care fellows, and even disreputable characters,  mixed with canny, pawky, canting Scotties, and talk of all the corners  of the world; ranting rollicking Balzacian yarns, rich in language, in  poetry, and tenderness; any minute in the day amongst such people you  might strike a yarn that would bear publication; the picturesque  interest of life does not seem to be on the high plains, or low levels,  but as it were between wind and water, where plain meets mountain, the  poor the rich, between happiness and sorrow, and light and shade; and  the fun of painting between one colour and the next. It is all very  respectably drab here, and we talk of intellectual and proper things.  For an hour to-day--no, two hours I am sure--I laboured at Indian  sociology and history and Vedas and things, with the barrister, and I  was tired! The barrister knows many books on these subjects, and  recommends me to read Sir W. W. Hunter's \"History of India\" in its  abridged form of only 700 pages; I suppose I must!--told my cousin I'd  been trying to talk Indian sociology and he shouted: said he knew a man  who had lived in India and studied the native life for twenty-eight  years, and confessed he knew as little about it at the end as at the  beginning; but R. admitted that whenever he had a knotty question of  native affairs to settle he always went to this man, and the decision  was invariably right. R. has qualified admiration for the Indians  honesty. Once, he said, he had to leave his house at a moment's notice,  to take home a sick relation, and left all standing, and on coming back  months after found every single stick of furniture just as he left it,  and not a single article stolen, except one door-mat; his night watchman  had taken it with him to another situation, leaving a humble message to  the effect that he had got so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#8)"],[1," to  think that his visits were discontinued. The hope was a relief that  could not be calculated; but still George had a feeling that it was too  supreme to last. His enemy had been too pertinacious to abandon his  design, whatever it was. He, however, began to indulge in a little more  liberty, and for several days he enjoyed it with impunity.    George was, from infancy, of a stirring active disposition and could  not endure confinement; and, having been of late much restrained in his  youthful exercises by this singular persecutor, he grew uneasy under  such restraint, and, one morning, chancing to awaken very early, he  arose to make an excursion to the top of Arthur's Seat, to breathe the  breeze of the dawning, and see the sun arise out of the eastern ocean.  The morning was calm and serene; and as he walked down the south back  of the Canongate, towards the Palace, the haze was so close around him  that he could not see the houses on the opposite side of the way. As he  passed the Lord-Commissioner's house, the guards were in attendance,  who cautioned him not to go by the Palace, as all the gates would be  shut and guarded for an hour to come, on which he went by the back of  St. Anthony's gardens, and found his way into that little romantic  glade adjoining to the saint's chapel and well. He was still involved  in a blue haze, like a dense smoke, but yet in the midst of it the  respiration was the most refreshing and delicious. The grass and the  flowers were loaden with dew; and, on taking off his hat to wipe his  forehead, he perceived that the black glossy fur of which his chaperon  was wrought was all covered with a tissue of the most delicate  silver--a fairy web, composed of little spheres, so minute that no eye  could discern any of them; yet there they were shining in lovely  millions. Afraid of defacing so beautiful and so delicate a garnish, he  replaced his hat with the greatest caution, and went on his way light  of heart.    As he approached the swire at the head of the dell--that little  delightful verge from which in one moment the eastern limits and shores  of Lothian arise on the view--as he approached it, I say, and a little  space from the height, he beheld, to his astonishment, a bright halo in  the cloud of haze, that rose in a semicircle over his head like a pale  rainbow. He was struck motionless at the view of the lovely vision; for  it so chanced that he had never seen the same appearance before, though  common at early morn. But he soon perceived the cause of the  phenomenon, and that it proceeded from the rays of the sun from a pure  unclouded morning sky striking upon this dense vapour which refracted  them. But, the better all the works of nature are understood, the more  they will be ever admired. That was a scene that would have entranced  the man of science with delight, but which the uninitiated and sordid  man would have regarded less than the mole rearing up his hill in  silence and in darkness.    George did admire this halo of glory, which still grew wider, and less  defined, as he approached the surface, of the cloud. But, to his utter  amazement and supreme delight, he found, on reaching the top of  Arthur's Seat, that this sublunary rainbow, this terrestrial glory, was  spread in its most vivid hues beneath his feet. Still he could not  perceive the body of the sun, although the light behind him was  dazzling; but the cloud of haze lying dense in that deep dell that  separates the hill from the rocks of Salisbury, and the dull shadow of  the hill mingling with that cloud made the dell a pit of darkness. On  that shadowy cloud was the lovely rainbow formed, spreading itself on a  horizontal plain, and having a slight and brilliant shade of all the  colours of the heavenly bow, but all of them paler and less defined.  But this terrestrial phenomenon of the early morn cannot be better  delineated than by the name given of it by the shepherd boys, \"The  little wee ghost of the rainbow.\"    Such was the description of the morning, and the wild shades of the  hill, that George gave to his father and Mr. Adam Gordon that same day  on which he had witnessed them; and it is necessary that the reader  should comprehend something of their nature to understand what follows.    He seated himself on the pinnacle of the rocky precipice, a little  within the top of the hill to the westward, and, with a light and  buoyant heart, viewed the beauties of the morning, and inhaled its  salubrious breeze. \"Here,\" thought he, \"I can converse with nature  without disturbance, and without being intruded on by any appalling or  obnoxious visitor.\" The idea of his brother's dark and malevolent looks  coming at that moment across his mind, he turned his eyes instinctively  to the right, to the point where that unwelcome guest was wont to make  his appearance. Gracious Heaven! What an apparition was there presented  to his view! He saw, delineated in the cloud, the shoulders, arms, and  features of a human being of the most dreadful aspect. The face was the  face of his brother, but dilated to twenty times the natural size. Its  dark eyes gleamed on him through the mist, while every furrow of its  hideous brow frowned deep as the ravines on the brow of the hill.  George started, and his hair stood up in bristles as he gazed on this  horrible monster. He saw every feature and every line of the face  distinctly as it gazed on him with an intensity that was hardly  brookable. Its eyes were fixed on him, in the same manner as those of  some carnivorous animal fixed on its prey; and yet there was fear and  trembling in these unearthly features, as plainly depicted as murderous  malice. The giant apparition seemed sometimes to be cowering down as in  terror, so that nothing but his brow and eyes were seen; still these  never turned one moment from their object--again it rose imperceptively  up, and began to approach with great caution; and, as it neared, the  dimensions of its form lessened, still continuing, however, far above  the natural size.    George conceived it to be a spirit. He could conceive it to be nothing  else; and he took it for some horrid demon by which he was haunted,  that had assumed the features of his brother in every lineament, but,  in taking on itself the human form, had miscalculated dreadfully on the  size, and presented itself thus to him in a blown-up, dilated frame of  embodied air, exhaled from the caverns of death or the regions of  devouring fire. He was further confirmed in the belief that it was a  malignant spirit on perceiving that it approached him across the front  of a precipice, where there was not footing for thing of mortal frame.  Still, what with terror and astonishment, he continued riveted to the  spot, till it approached, as he deemed, to within two yards of him; and  then, perceiving that it was setting itself to make a violent spring on  him, he started to his feet and fled distractedly in the opposite  direction, keeping his eye cast behind him lest he had been seized in  that dangerous place. But the very first bolt that he made in his  flight he came in contact with a real body of flesh and blood, and that  with such violence that both went down among some scragged rocks, and  George rolled over the other. The being called out \"Murder\"; and,  rising, fled precipitately. George then perceived that it was his  brother; and being confounded between the shadow and the substance, he  knew not what he was doing or what he had done; and, there being only  one natural way of retreat from the brink of the rock, he likewise  arose and pursued the affrighted culprit with all his speed towards the  top of the hill. Wringhim was braying out, \"Murder! murder!\" at which  George, being disgusted, and his spirits all in a ferment from some  hurried idea of intended harm, the moment he came up with the craven he  seized him rudely by the shoulder, and clapped his hand on his mouth.  \"Murder, you beast!\" said he; \"what do you mean by roaring out murder  in that way? Who the devil is murdering you, or offering to murder you?\"    Wringhim forced his mouth from under his brother's hand, and roared  with redoubled energy: \"Eh! Egh! Murder! murder!\" etc. George had felt  resolute to put down this shocking alarm, lest someone might hear it  and fly to the spot, or draw inferences widely different from the  truth; and, perceiving the terror of this elect youth to be so great  that expostulation was vain, he seized him by the mouth and nose with  his left hand so strenuously that he sank his fingers into his cheeks.  But, the poltroon still attempting to bray out, George gave him such a  stunning blow with his fist on the left temple that he crumbled, as it  were, to the ground, but more from the effects of terror than those of  the blow. His nose, however, again gushed out blood, a system of  defence which seemed as natural to him as that resorted to by the race  of stinkards. He then raised himself on his knees and hams, and raising  up his ghastly face, while the blood streamed over both ears, he  besought his life of his brother, in the most abject whining manner,  gaping and blubbering most piteously.    \"Tell me then, Sir,\" said George, resolved to make the most of the  wretch's terror--\"tell me for what purpose it is that you haunt my  steps? Tell me plainly, and instantly, else I will throw you from the  verge of that precipice.\"    \"Oh, I will never do it again! I will never do it again! Spare my life,  dear, good brother! Spare my life! Sure I never did you any hurt.\"    \"Swear to me, then, by the God that made you, that you will never  henceforth follow after me to torment me with your hellish threatening  looks; swear that you will never again come into my presence without  being invited. Will you take an oath to this effect?\"    \"Oh yes! I will, I will!\"    \"But this is not all: you must tell me for what purpose you sought me  out here this morning?\"    \"O"]]]
