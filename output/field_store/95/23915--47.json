No violence, mind; but I think you might  give them a lesson and turn them out.\"    \"But they were the two new pupils, sir.\"    \"What!  Severn and the Prince?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" came in chorus.    \"Dear me!  The Doctor would be very angry if he knew.  He strongly  objects to his young gentlemen making friends with strangers.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Burney; \"and they have gone out of bounds.\"    \"Will you keep your mouth shut?\" whispered Slegge; and, dropping a pace  behind the master, he clenched and held up one fist very close to  Burney's nose as if it were a curiosity that the boy might like to see.    \"Ah, well,\" said Mr Morris, \"perhaps they thought that it would be the  safest place behind the elephant's keepers.  These tamed animals have a  great dread of the whip.\"    All was beautifully calm now out in the field.  The grass seemed greener  than ever.  There was an excited crowd in the main road by the damaged  hedge, and quite a cluster of pupils, masters, and servants up by the  house; but Morris and his little party were alone, and all seemed so  safe that they grew thoroughly brave, and quite nonchalantly edged their  way on towards the broken panel which looked temptingly clear.    All was still, and there was no suggestion of danger, while as they  slowly went close up there was no sound of voice.  It was perfectly  evident that the elephant must have been followed far away, and had  probably gone right on through the neighbouring grounds and made his way  somewhere out at the back.    They were approaching diagonally, and as they came very near to the  opening a curious electric kind of feeling such as is called by old  women \"the creeps,\" manifested itself in what doctors term the \"lumbar  regions\" of every one's back.    But they were all very brave, and Morris suddenly became conscious of  the fact that the boys were all looking at him in a very questioning  way, so he could not help feeling that there were drawbacks to being the  leader of a party when there is possible danger somewhere ahead, and it  is impossible for the sake of one's credit to retreat.    This is especially the case in connection with dogs that are supposed to  be mad and have to be driven away, or in haunted rooms, and the walking  of ghosts and other vapours of that kind which a puff of the wind of  common-sense would always blow away.    Somehow or other, Morris began to talk very loudly to his young  companions as he screwed his courage up to the sticking-point, feeling  as he did that at all hazards he must go right up to that opening and  just look through.  And with this intent, followed not quite closely by  the boys, he went so near that he had but to take one more step to be  able to look through into the next field; in fact, he was in the act of  stretching out his hand to lay it upon one of the big oaken splints that  hung from its copper nail, when there was a sharp report as if a pistol  had been fired just on the other side, and in an instant the whole party  were in retreat.    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Morris.  At least it was supposed to be a laugh;  but the sounds were very peculiar, and he looked strangely white as he  shouted, \"Stop, boys, stop!  What are you afraid of?  It was only one of  those carter fellows who cracked his whip.--Well, my man,\" he continued,  in a husky voice that did not seem like his own, to one of the  van-drivers who now appeared in the opening, \"have you caught the  elephant?\"    As the man replied the boys began to collect again from their  ignominious flight, and it was observable that they were all laughing at  one another in an accusatory manner, each feeling full of contempt for  the pusillanimous behaviour of the others, while the looks of Morris  might have given the whole party a conscious sting.    But there was the van-driver answering as the boys clustered hurriedly  up.    \"No, sir, and I've had enough of it,\" said the man.  \"It aren't my  business.  I'm monkeys, I am; and got enough to do to keep they  mischievous imps in their cage.  I don't hold with elephants; they are  too big for me, and I know that chap of old.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Morris, eager to cover his last retreat by drawing the  man into conversation.    \"Yes, sir, he's a treacherous beggar.  Pretends to be fond of a man, and  gets him up against a wall or the side of a tree, and then plays pussy  cat.\"    \"Plays what?\" cried Slegge.    \"Pussy cat, sir.  You know: rubs hisself up again' a man same as a  kitten does against your leg.  But it aren't the same, because if the  pore chap don't dodge him he gets rubbed out like a nought on the  slate.\"    \"Dear me!  Extraordinary!\" said Morris.  \"But--er--er--where is the  fugitive beast now?\"    \"Ah, you may well call him a fugity beast, sir.  I don't quite know what  it means; but that's a good name for him, and he desarves it.  Oh, he's  over yonder now, right in the middle of yon orchard, and nobody durst go  near him.  Every time any one makes a start he begins to roosh, and then  goes back in amongst the trees, and when I come away I never see  anything like it in my life.  It was bushels then.\"    \"Bushels--bushels, my man?\"    \"Yes, sir, he was a-picking the apples with that trunk of his, and  tucking them in as fast as ever they'd go.  A beast! he'll fill hisself  before he's done.  He won't leave off now he's got the chance, and he'll  kill anybody who goes nigh him.  You see, the master keeps him pretty  short to tame him down and keep him from going on the rampage.  It's all  a mistake having a thing like that in a show.  You take my word for it,  sir.  If you goes in for a mennar-gerry you take to monkeys.  They don't  take nothing to keep, for the public feeds them on nuts and buns, and if  it warn't for their catching cold and going on the sick-list they'd be  profit every ounce.\"    \"Er--thank you, my man,\" said Morris haughtily; \"but I don't think it  probable that I shall venture upon a peripatetic zoo--eh, young  gentlemen?\"    \"Oh no, sir!\" came in chorus.    \"Can we see the huge pachyderm from here?\"    \"Packing apples, sir?  No, no, don't you alter that there, sir.  You  called him fugity beast just now, and you can't beat that.--No, you  can't see him.  He's in there among them apple-trees.\"    \"Why, he's got into old Bunton's orchard, sir,\" cried Slegge, and he  stepped forward to the opening.  \"Yes, you can't see the elephant, sir,  but you can see the men all round.  I think they are tying him up to a  tree, sir.\"    \"Yes, that's likely,\" said the man grimly.  \"I dare say they've all got  a bit of string in their pockets as will just hold him.\"    \"Er--do you think we could go up a little closer, my man, without the  young gentlemen getting into danger?\" said Morris, in the full  expectation that he would be told it would be dangerous in the extreme.    \"Go closer, sir?  Yes, of course you can.  He won't hurt none of you so  long as you don't try to take his apples away.  If yer did I shouldn't  like to be you.\"    \"Let's go, then, sir,\" cried Burney eagerly, and the desire seemed to be  growing in the other boys' breasts.    \"Well, I don't know,\" said Morris; \"that is, if you will promise not to  go too close.\"    \"Oh, we won't go too close, sir,\" cried Slegge warmly, and he looked as  if he were speaking the truth.    The result was that the master, trying very hard to carry off his  disinclination to go with the remark, \"We don't often have such an  opportunity as this, boys,\" led the way across the park-like field of  the Doctor's neighbour towards an extensive orchard, in which, nearly  hidden by the trees, the escaped monster was having his banquet of  apples, and turning a deaf ear, or rather two deaf ears of the largest  size, to all orders to come out.        CHAPTER SIX.    GLYN AND SINGH TO THE RESCUE.    As the party from the school drew nearer they could hear the occasional  crack of a whip and a loud order given in a rather highly pitched tone  to the beast, bidding him come out.    Then followed the snapping of twigs and a peculiarly dull grumbling  sound as if the elephant were muttering his objections to the orders of  his master, the bald-headed man, who still held his hat in one hand, his  yellow handkerchief in the other, and dabbed the big white  billiard-ball-like expanse as if he felt that it was very warm work.    Then there was a _crunch, crunch, crunch_, as if pippins were being  reduced to pulp, and more twigs were heard to snap.    \"Let him hear the whip again, Jem,\" shouted Mr Ramball.    \"Oh, he won't come for that, sir,\" growled the man addressed; but he  made the long cart-whip he carried crack loudly three times in obedience  to the order; and as the fresh party drew as near to the orchard as they  cared to go, after all had given a furtive glance round for a way to  escape, the low grumbling muttering grew louder; while as the animal  moved right into sight so did those who were watching him, and Slegge  and his companions saw Glyn and Singh approach.    There was another movement on the part of the elephant, whose towering  form came through the thickly growing orchard trees to one whose burden  was of a deep rich-red, and here it stood bowing its head up and down,  and slowly shaking it from side to side, while the trunk swung and  turned and turned and swung here and there, till its owner had selected  the fruit most pleasing to its little pig-like eye, when with  serpent-like motion it rose in the air, and the end curled round the  selected fruit, which was lowered and tucked out of sight on the  instant.    \"Now, look here, my lads,\" cried the proprietor of the menagerie to his  men, \"I can't have you all standing here gaping like a set of idiots as  if you had never seen the brute before.  Go in round behind him with  your whips and drive him out.\"    There was a murmur of grumbles from the men, that seemed to be echoed by  the elephant, which went on swinging its head up and down as if it were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#8)"],[1,"into trouble at home.\"    \"Not such trouble as this, Jem.\"    \"Not such trouble as this, my lad?  Worser ever so much, for you don't  deserve it, and I do, leastwise, my Sally says I do, and I suppose I do  for being such a fool as to marry her.\"    \"You ought to be ashamed to talk like that, Jem.\"    \"So ought you, Mas' Don.  I've often felt as if I should like to do as  you say and run right off, but I don't do it.\"    \"You have felt like that, Jem?\" cried Don, eagerly.    \"Yes, often, my lad.\"    \"Then let's go, Jem.  Nobody cares for us here.  Let's go right away to  one of the beautiful foreign countries Mike told me about, and begin a  new life.\"    \"Shall us, Mas' Don?\"    \"Yes; why not?  Get a passage in some ship, and stop where we like.  He  has told me of dozens of places that must be glorious.\"    \"Then we won't go,\" said Jem, decidedly.  \"If Mike Bannock says they're  fine spots, don't you believe him; they're bad 'uns.\"    \"Then let's go and select a place for ourselves,\" cried Don.    \"Lor!  I do wonder at you, Mas' Don, wantin' to leave such a mother as  you've got, and asking me to leave my wife.  Why, what would they do?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Don, sadly.  \"They care very little for us now.  You can do as you like; I shall go.\"    \"Nay, nay, you won't, my lad.\"    \"Yes, Jem, I think I shall.\"    \"Ah, that's better!  Think about it.\"    \"I should have thought that you'd be glad to come with me, Jem.\"    \"So I should, my lad; but there's a some'at as they calls dooty as allus  seems to have hold on me tight.  You wait a bit, and see how things turn  out.\"    \"But I shall have to appear before the magistrates, and be called a  thief.\"    \"Ah, well, that won't be pleasant, my lad, of course; but wait.\"    \"Then you wouldn't go with me, Jem?\"    \"Don't tempt a man, Mas' Don, because I should like to go with you, and  course I shouldn't like to go with you, because I shouldn't like you to  go.  There, I must get on with my work.\"    At that very moment came the call of a shrill voice--    \"Jem!\"    \"There I told you so.  She see me come in here, and she's after me  because I haven't got on with my casks.  Oh, how sharp she is!\"    Jem gave Don an intelligent nod of the head, and moved out, while the  lad stood gazing at the opposite window and listened to the sharp voice  addressing the foreman of the yard.    \"Poor Jem!  He isn't happy either!\" said Don, sadly, as the voices died  away.  \"We might go right off abroad, and they'd be sorry then and think  better of us.  I wish I was ten thousand miles away.\"    He seated himself slowly on his stool, and rested his arms upon the  desk, folding them across his chest; and then, looking straight before  him at the door, his mental gaze went right through the panels, and he  saw silver rivers flowing over golden sands, while trees of the most  glorious foliage drooped their branches, and dipped the ends in the  glancing water.  The bright sun shone overhead; the tendrils and waving  grass were gay with blossoms; birds of lovely plumage sang sweetly; and  in the distance, on the one hand, fading away into nothingness, were the  glorious blue mountains, and away to his right a shimmering sea.    Don Lavington had a fertile brain, and on the canvas of his imagination  he painted panorama after panorama, all bright and beautiful.  There  were no clouds, no storms, no noxious creatures, no trials and dangers.  All was as he thought it ought to be, and about as different from the  reality as could be supposed.  But Don did not know that in his youthful  ignorance, and as he sat and gazed before him, he asked himself whether  he had not better make up his mind to go right away.    \"Yes, I will go!\" he said, excitedly, as he started up in his seat.    \"No,\" he said directly after, as in imagination now he seemed to be  gazing into his mother's reproachful eyes, \"it would be too cowardly; I  could not go.\"        CHAPTER SEVEN.    DON AND JEM GO HOME TO TEA.    It required no little effort on Don's part to go home that afternoon to  the customary meat tea which was the main meal of the day at his uncle's  home.    He felt how it would be--that his uncle would not speak to him beyond  saying a few distant words, such as were absolutely necessary.  Kitty  would avert her eyes, and his mother keep giving him reproachful looks,  every one of which was a silent prayer to him to speak.    The afternoon had worn away, and he had done little work for thinking.  His uncle had not been back, and at last Jem's footstep was heard  outside, and he passed the window to tap lightly on the door and then  open it.    \"Come, Mas' Don,\" he said, cheerily, \"going to work all night?\"    \"No, Jem, no.  I was just thinking of going.\"    \"That's right, my lad, because it's past shutting-up time.  Feel better  now, don't you?\"    \"No, Jem, I feel worse.\"    \"Are you going to keep the yard open all the evening, Jem?\" cried a  shrill voice.  \"Why don't you lock-up and come in to tea?\"    \"There!  Hear that!\" said Jem, anxiously.  \"Do go, Mas' Don, or I  sha'n't get to the end on it.  'Nuff to make a man talk as you do.\"    \"Jem!\"    \"Here, I'm a-coming, arn't I?\" he cried, giving the door a thump with  his fist.  \"Don't shout the ware'us down!\"    \"Jem!\"    \"Now did you ever hear such a aggrawatin' woman?\" cried Jem.  \"She's  such a little un that I could pick her up, same as you do a kitten, Mas'  Don--nothing on her as you may say; but the works as is inside her is  that strong that I'm 'fraid of her.\"    \"Jem!\"    He opened the door with a rush.    \"Ya-a-a-as!\" he roared; \"don't you know as Mas' Don arn't gone?\"    Little Mrs Wimble, who was coming fiercely up, flounced round, and the  wind of her skirts whirled up a dust of scraps of matting and cooper's  chips as she went back to the cottage.    \"See that, Mas' Don?  Now you think you've all the trouble in the world  on your shoulders, but look at me.  Talk about a woman's temper turning  the milk sour in a house.  Why, just now there's about three hundred  hogsheads o' sugar in our ware'us--two hundred and ninety-three, and  four damages not quite full, which is as good as saying three hundred--  see the books whether I arn't right.  Well, Mas' Don, I tell you for the  truth that I quite frights it--I do, indeed--as she'll turn all that  there sweetness into sour varjus 'fore she's done.  Going, sir?\"    \"Yes, Jem, I'm going--home,\" said Don; and then to himself, \"Ah, I wish  I had a home.\"    \"Poor Mas' Don!\" said Jem, as he watched the lad go out through the  gate; \"he's down in the dumps now, and no mistake; and dumps is the lot  o' all on us, more or less.\"    Then Jem went in to his tea, and Don went slowly home to his, and  matters were exactly as he had foreseen.  His uncle was scarcely polite;  Kitty gave him sharp, indignant glances when their eyes met, and then  averted hers; and from time to time his mother looked at him in so  pitiful and imploring a manner that one moment he felt as if he were an  utter scoundrel, and the next that he would do anything to take her in  his arms and try and convince her that he was not so bad as she thought.    It was a curious mental encounter between pride, obstinacy, and the  better feelings of his nature; and unfortunately the former won, for  soon after the meal was over he hurried out of the room.    \"I can't bear it,\" he cried to himself, as he went up to his own little  chamber,--\"I can't bear it, and I will not.  Every one's against me.  If  I stop I shall be punished, and I can't face all that to-morrow.  Good-bye, mother.  Some day you'll think differently, and be sorry for  all this injustice, and then--\"    A tear moistened Don's eye as he thought of his mother and her tender,  loving ways, and of what a pity it was that they ever came there to his  uncle's, and it was not the tear that made Don see so blindly.    \"I can't stand it, and I will not,\" he cried, passionately.  \"Uncle  hates me, and Mike Bannock's right, scoundrel as he is.  Uncle has  robbed me, and I'll go and fight for myself in the world, and when I get  well off I'll come back and seize him by the throat and make him give up  all he has taken.\"    Don talked to himself a good deal more of this nonsense, and then, with  his mind fully made up, he went to the chest of drawers, took out a  handkerchief, spread it open upon the bed, and placed in it a couple of  clean shirts and three or four pairs of stockings.    \"There,\" he said, as he tied them up tightly as small as he could, \"I  won't have any more.  I'll go and start fair, so that I can be  independent and be beholden to nobody.\"    Tucking the bundle under his arm, he could not help feeling that it was  a very prominent-looking package--the great checked blue and white  handkerchief seeming to say, \"This boy's going to seek his fortune!\" and  he wished that he was not obliged to take it.    But, setting his teeth, he left the room with the drawers open, and his  best suit, which he had felt disposed to take, tossed on a chair, and  then began to descend.    It was a glorious summer evening, and though he was in dirty, smoky  Bristol, everything seemed to look bright and attractive, and to produce  a sensation of low-spiritedness such as he had never felt before.    He descended and passed his mother's room, and then went down more  slowly, for he could hear the murmur of voices in the dining-room, which  he had to pass to reach the front door, outside which he did not care  what happened; but now he had to pass that dining-room, and go along the  passage and by the stand upon which his cocked hat hung.    It was nervous work, but he went on down the first flight, running his  hand slowly along the hand-balustrade, all down which he had so often  slid while Kitty looked on laughing, and yet alarmed lest he should  fall.  And what a long time ago that seemed!    He had just reached the bottom flight, and was wondering what to say if  the door"]]]
