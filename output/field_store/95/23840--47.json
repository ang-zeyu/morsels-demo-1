The very purposes to which they are applied, as a  parapet, a railing, a balustrade, a portico, piazza, or porch; all these  may be of wood, even when the material of the house _proper_ is of the  most durable kind; and by being painted in keeping with the building  itself, produce a fine effect, and do no violence to good taste or the  most fastidious propriety. They may be even sanded to a color, and  grained, stained, or otherwise brought to an identity, almost, with the  material of the house, and be quite proper, because they simply are  _appendages_ of convenience, necessity, or luxury, to the building  itself, and may be taken away without injuring or without defacing the  main structure. They are not a _material_ part of the building itself,  but reared for purposes which may be dispensed with. It is a matter of  taste or preference, that they were either built there, or that they  remain permanently afterward, and of consequence, proper that they be of  wood. Yet they should not _imitate_ stone or brick. They should still  show that they _are_ of wood, but in color and outside preservation  denote that they are appendages to a _stone_ or _brick_ house, by  complying with the proper shades in color which predominate in the  building itself, and become their own subordinate character.    Not being a professional painter, or compounder of colors, we shall  offer no receipts or specifics for painting or washing buildings.  Climate affects the composition of both paints and washes, and those who  are competent in this line, are the proper persons to dictate their  various compositions; and we do but common justice to the skill and  intelligence of our numerous mechanics, when we recommend to those who  contemplate building, to apply forthwith to such as are masters of their  trade for all the information they require on the various subjects  connected with it. One who sets out to be his own architect, builder,  and painter, is akin to the lawyer in the proverb, who has a fool for  his client, when pleading his own case, and quite as apt to have quack  in them all. Hints, general outlines, and oftentimes matters of detail  in interior convenience, and many other minor affairs may be given by  the proprietor, when he is neither a professional architect, mechanic,  or even an amateur; but in all things affecting the _substantial_ and  important parts of his buildings, he should consult those who are  proficient and experienced in the department on which he consults them.  And it may perhaps be added that none _professing_ to be such, are  competent, unless well instructed, and whose labors have met the  approbation of those competent to judge.    There is one kind of color, prevailing to a great extent in many parts  of our country, particularly the northern and eastern, which, in its  effect upon any one having an eye to a fitness of things in country  buildings, is a monstrous perversion of good taste. That is the glaring  red, made up of Venetian red, ochre, or Spanish brown, with doors and  windows touched off with white. The only apology we have ever heard  given for such a barbarism was, that it is a good, strong, and lasting  color. We shall not go into an examination as to that fact, but simply  answer, that if it be so, there are other colors, not more expensive,  which are equally strong and durable, and infinitely more tasteful and  fitting. There can be nothing less comporting with the simplicity of  rural scenery, than a glaring red color on a building. It _connects_  with nothing natural about it; it neither _fades_ into any surrounding  shade of soil or vegetation, and must of necessity, stand out in its own  bold and unshrouded impudence, a perfect Ishmaelite in color, and a  perversion of every thing harmonious in the design. We eschew _red_,  therefore, from every thing in rural architecture.          A SHORT CHAPTER ON TASTE.      The compound words, or terms _good-taste_ and _bad-taste_ have been used  in the preceding pages without, perhaps, sufficiently explaining what is  meant by the word _taste_, other than as giving vague and unsatisfactory  terms to the reader in measuring the subject in hand. _Taste_ is a term  universally applied in criticism of the fine-arts, such as painting,  sculpture, architecture, &c., &c., of which there are many schools--of  _taste_, we mean--some of them, perhaps natural, but chiefly  conventional, and all more or less arbitrary. The proverb, \"there is no  accounting for taste,\" is as old as the aforesaid schools themselves,  and defines perfectly our own estimate of the common usage of the term.    As we have intended to use it, Webster defines the word _taste_ to be  \"the faculty of discerning beauty, order, congruity, proportion,  symmetry, or whatever constitutes excellence; style; manner with respect  to what is pleasing.\" With this understanding, therefore; a fitness to  the purpose for which a thing is intended--got up in a manner agreeable  to the eye and the mind--preserving also a harmony between its various  parts and uses; pleasing to the eye, as addressed to the sense, and  satisfactory to the mind, as appropriate to the object for which it is  required;--these constitute _good-taste_, as the term is here  understood.    The term _style_, also, is \"the _manner_ or _form_ of a thing.\"  When we say, \"that is a stylish house,\" it should mean that it is in,  or approaches some particular style of building recognized by the  schools. It may or may not be in accordance with good taste, and is,  consequently, subject to the same capricious test in its government. Yet  _styles_ are subject to arrangement, and are classified in the several  schools of architecture, either as distinct specimens of acknowledged  orders, as the Doric, the Ionic, the Corinthian, in Grecian  architecture, or, the Tuscan and Composite, which are, more distinctly,  styles of Roman architecture. To these may be added the Egyptian, the  most massive of all; and either of them, in their proper character,  grand and imposing when applied to public buildings or extensive  structures, but altogether inapplicable, from their want of lightness  and convenience, to country or even city dwellings. Other styles--not  exactly orders--of architecture, such as the Italian, the Romanesque,  the Gothic, the Swiss, with their modifications--all of which admit of a  variety of departures from fixed rules, not allowed in the more rigid  orders--may be adapted in a variety of ways, to the most agreeable and  harmonious arrangement in architectural effect, for dwellings and  structures appurtenant to them.    The Italian style of architecture, modified somewhat in pretension and  extent, is admirably adapted to most parts of the United States. Its  general lightness, openness, and freedom gives a wide range of choice;  and its wings, verandas, and terraces, stretching off in any and almost  every direction desired, from the main building, make it exceedingly  appropriate for general use. The modern, or rural Gothic, branching off  sometimes into what is termed the English cottage style, and in many  instances blending so intimately with the Italian, as hardly to mark the  line of division, is also a beautiful _arrangement_ of building for  country dwellings. These, in ruder structures, may also be carried into  the Rustic--not a style proper, in itself--but so termed as  approximating in execution or pretension to either of the above; while  the Swiss, with its hanging roofs, and sheltering eaves may be  frequently brought in aid to show out the rustic form in more  completeness, and in greater harmony with surrounding objects, than  either of the others.    For farm houses, either of these _arrangements_ or departures from a  _set_ and _positive_ style, are better fitted than any which we have  noticed; and in some one or other of the modifications named, we have  applied them in the examples submitted in this work. They may not  therefore be viewed as _distinct_ delineations of an _order_ of  architecture, or style _proper_, even; but as a _mode_ appropriate to  the object required. And so long as they do not absolutely conflict with  true taste, or in their construction commit a barbarism upon any  acknowledged system of architecture, in any of its modifications, we  hazard no impropriety in introducing them for the imitation of country  builders. Congruity with the objects to which it is applied should be  the chief merit of any structure whatever; and so long as that object be  attained, good taste is not violated, and utility is fully subserved.    Intimately connected with this subject, in rural buildings, is the  _shape_ of the structure. Many of the designs recently introduced for  the imitation of builders, are full of angles and all sorts of zig-zag  lines, which, although they may add to the variety of style, or relieve  the monotony of straight and continuous lines, are carried to a needless  excess, expensive in their construction, and entail infinite trouble  upon the owner or occupant, in the repairs they subject him to, in the  leakages continually occurring, against which last, either of wind or  rain, it is almost impossible to guard. And what, let us ask, are the  benefits of a parcel of needless gables and peaked windows, running up  like owl's ears, above the eaves of a house, except to create expense,  and invite leakage and decay? If in appearance, they provoke an  association of that kind, they certainly are not in good taste; and a  foot or two of increased height in a wall, or a low window sufficient  for the purpose intended, would give a tone of dignity, of comfort, and  real utility, which a whole covey of such pretentious things could not.  All such trumpery should be scouted from the dwelling house of the  farmer, and left to the special"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#8)"],[1,"eke, who  impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to  Kana.  But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers  have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts,  though wrong in his contention--hotly contested by Beke--that  the Blue Nile was the main stream.  The topographical results  of his explorations were published in Paris in 1860-1873 in  Geodesie d'Ethiopie, full of the most valuable information and  illustrated by ten maps.  Of the Geographie de l'Ethiopie  (Paris, 1890) only one volume has been published.  In Un  Catalogue raisonne de manuscrits ethiopiens (Paris, 1859)  is a description of 234 Ethiopian manuscripts collected by  Antoine.  He also compiled various vocabularies, including  a Dictionnaire de la langue amarinna (Paris, 1881), and  prepared an edition of the Shepherd of Hermas, with the  Latin version, in 1860.  He published numerous papers dealing  with the geography of Abyssinia, Ethiopian coins and ancient  inscriptions.  Under the title of Reconnaissances magnetiques  he published in 1890 an account of the magnetic observations  made by him in the course of several journeys to the Red  Sea and the Levant.  The general account of the travels of  the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the  title of Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie. Both brothers  received the grand medal of the Paris Geographical Society in  1850.  Antoine was a knight of the Legion of Honour and a  member of the Academy of Sciences.  He died in 1897, and  bequeathed an estate in the Pyrenees, yielding 40,000 francs  a year, to the Academy of Sciences, on condition of its  producing within fifty years a catalogue of half-a-million  stars.  His brother Arnaud died in 1893. (J. S. K.)    ABBADIE, JAKOB (1654?-1727), Swiss Protestant divine,  was born at Nay in Bern.  He studied at Sedan, Saumur and  Puylaurens, with such success that he received the degree of  doctor in theology at the age of seventeen.  After spending  some years in Berlin as minister of a French Protestant church,  where he had great success as a preacher, he accompanied  Marshal Schomberg, in 1688, to England, and next year became  minister of the French church in the Savoy, London.  His  strong attachment to the cause of King William appears in  his elaborate defence of the Revolution (Defense de la  nation britannique, 1692) as well as in his history of the  conspiracy of 1696 (Histoire de la grande conspiration  d'Angleterre). The king promoted him to the deanery of Killaloe  in Ireland.  He died in London in 1727.  Abbadie was a man  of great ability and an eloquent preacher, but is best known  by his religious treatises, several of which were translated  from the original French into other languages and had a wide  circulation throughout Europe.  The most important of these are  Traite de la verite de la religion chretienne (1684); its  continuation, Traite de la divinite de Jesus-Christ  (1689); and L'Art de se connaitre soi-meme (1692).    'ABBAHU, the name of a Palestinian 'amora (q.v.)  who flourished c. 279-320. 'Abbahu encouraged the  study of Greek by Jews.  He was famous as a collector of  traditional lore, and is very often cited in the Talmud.    ABBA MARI (in full, Abba Mari ben Moses benJoseph), French  rabbi, was born at Lunel, near Montpellier, towards the end of  the 13th century.  He is also known as Yarhi from his birthplace  (Heb.  Yerah, i.e. moon, lune), and he further took the  name Astruc, Don Astruc or En Astruc of Lunel.  The descendant  of men learned in rabbinic lore, Abba Mari devoted himself  to the study of theology and philosophy, and made himself  acquainted with the writing of Moses Maimonides and Nachmanides  as well as with the Talmud.  In Montpellier, where he lived  from 1303 to 1306, he was much distressed by the prevalence  of Aristotelian rationalism, which, through the medium of  the works of Maimonides, threatened the authority of the Old  Testament, obedience to the law, and the belief in miracles and  revelation.  He, therefore, in a series of letters (afterwards  collected under the title Minhat Kenaot, i.e. ``Jealousy  Offering'') called upon the famous rabbi Solomon ben Adret  of Barcelona to come to the aid of orthodoxy.  Ben Adret,  with the approval of other prominent Spanish rabbis, sent a  letter to the community at Montpellier proposing to forbid the  study of philosophy to those who were less than thirty years  of age, and, in spite of keen opposition from the liberal  section, a decree in this sense was issued by ben Adret in  1305.  The result was a great schism among the Jews of Spain  and southern France, and a new impulse was given to the study  of philosophy by the unauthorized interference of the Spanish  rabbis.  On the expulsion of the Jews from France by Philip  IV. in 1306, Abba Mari settled at Perpignan, where he  published the letters connected with the controversy.  His  subsequent history is unknown.  Beside the letters, he was  the author of liturgical poetry and works on civil law.    AUTHORITIES.--Edition of the Minhat Kenaot by M. L.  Bislichis (Pressburg, 1838); E. Renan, Les rabbins francais,  pp. 647 foll.; Perles, Salomo ben Abrahann ben Adereth,  pp. 15-54; Jewish Encyclopaedia, s.v. ``Abba Mari.''    ABBAS I. (1813-1854), pasha of Egypt, was a son of Tusun  Pasha and grandson of Mehemet Ali, founder of the reigning  dynasty.  As a young man he fought in Syria under Ibrahim Pasha  (q.v.), his real or supposed uncle.  The death of Ibrahim  in November 1848 made Abbas regent of Egypt, and in August  following, on the death of Mehemet Alh--who had been deposed  in July 1848 on account of mental weakness,--Abbas succeeded  to the pashalik.  He has been generally described as a mere  voluptuary, but Nubar Pasha spoke of him as a true Turkish  gentleman of the old school.  He was without question a  reactionary, morose and taciturn, and spent nearly all his  time shut up in his palace.  He undid, as far as lay in his  power, the works of his grandfather, good and bad.  Among  other things he abolished trade monopolies, closed factories  and schools, and reduced the strength of the army to 9000  men.  He was inaccessible to adventurers bent on plundering  Egypt, but at the instance of the British government  allowed the construction of a railway from Alexandria to  Cairo.  In July 1854 he was murdered in Benha Palace by two  of his slaves, and was succeeded by his uncle, Said Pasha.    ABBAS II. (1874-- ), khedive of Egypt.  Abbas Hilmi Pasha,  great-great-grandson of Mehemet Ali, born on the 14th of  July 1874, succeeded his father, Tewfik Pasha, as khedive  of Egypt on the 8th of January 1892.  When a boy he visited  England, and he had an English tutor for some time in  Cairo.  He then went to school in Lausanne, and from there  passed on to the Theresianum in Vienna.  In addition to  Turkish, his mother tongue, he acquired fluency in Arabic,  and a good conversational knowledge of English, French and  German.  He was still at college in Vienna when the sudden  death of his father raised him to the Khedivate; and he was  barely of age according to Turkish law, which fixes majority  at eighteen in cases of succession to the throne.  For  some time he did not co-operate very cordially with Great  Britain.  He was young and eager to exercise his new  power.  His throne and life had not been saved for him by the  British, as was the case with his father.  He was surrounded  by intriguers who were playing a game of their own, and for  some time he appeared almost disposed to be as reactionary  as his great-uncle Abbas I. But in process of time he learnt  to understand the importance of British counsels.  He paid  a second visit to England in 1900, during which he frankly  acknowledged the great good the British had done in Egypt,  and declared himself ready to follow their advice and to  co-operate with the British officials administering Egyptian  affairs.  The establishment of a sound system of native  justice, the great remission of taxation, the reconquest  of the Sudan, the inauguration of the stupendous irrigation  works at Assuan, the increase of cheap, sound education,  each received his approval and all the assistance he could  give.  He displayed more interest in agriculture than in  statecraft, and his farm of cattle and horses at Koubah,  near Cairo, would have done credit to any agricultural  show in England; at Montaza, near Alexandria, he created  a similar establishment.  He married the Princess Ikbal  Hanem and had several children.  Mahommed Abdul Mouneim,  the heir-apparent, was born on the 20th of February 1899.    ABBAS I. (e. 1557-1628 or 1629), shah of Persia, called  the Great, was the son of shah Mahommed (d. 1586) . In the  midst of general anarchy in Persia, he was proclaimed ruler of  Khorasan, and obtained possession of the Persian throne in  1586.  Determined to raise the fallen fortunes of his country,  he first directed his efforts against the predatory Uzbegs,  who occupied and harassed Khorasan.  After a long and severe  struggle, he regained Meshed, defeated them in a great battle  near Herat in 1597, and drove them out of his dominions.  In  the wars he carried on with the Turks during nearly the whole  of his reign, his successes were numerous, and he acquired,  or regained, a large extent of territory.  By the victory he  gained at Bassora in 1605 he extended his empire beyond the  Euphrates; sultan Ahmed I. was forced to cede Shirvan and  Kurdistan in 1611; the united armies of the Turks and Tatars  were completely defeated near Sultanieh in 1618, and Abbas  made peace on very favourable terms; and on the Turks renewing  the war, Bagdad fell into his hands after a year's siege in  1623.  In 1622 he took the island of Ormuz from the Portuguese,  by the assistance of the British, and much of its trade was  diverted to the town of Bander-Abbasi, which was named after the  shah."]]]
