Language and song are likewise forgotten with all human things,  all except his laugh; for when hunger is satisfied, and the sun shines  pleasantly as he reposes on the dry leaves on the ground or sits aloft  on a branch, at times a sudden feeling of gladness possesses him, and he  expresses it in that one way--the long, wild, ringing peal of laughter.  Listening to that strange sound, although I could not see I could yet  picture him, as, aware of my cautious approach, he moved shyly behind  the mossy trunk of some tree and waited silently for me to pass. A lean,  grey little man, clad in a quaintly barred and mottled mantle, woven by  his own hands from some soft silky material, and a close-fitting brown  peaked cap on his head with one barred feather in it for ornament, and a  small wizened grey face with a thin sharp nose, puckered lips, and a  pair of round, brilliant, startled eyes.    So distinct was this image to my mind's eye that it became unnecessary  for me to see the creature, and I ceased to look for him; then all at  once came disillusion, when one day, hearing the familiar high-pitched  laugh with its penetrating and somewhat nasal tone, I looked and beheld  the thing that had laughed just leaving its perch on a branch near the  ground and winging its way across the field. It was only a bird after  all--only the wryneck; and that mysterious faculty I spoke of, saying  that we all of us possessed something of it (meaning only some of us)  was nothing after all but the old common faculty of imagination.    Later on I saw it again on half-a-dozen occasions, but never succeeded  in getting what I call a satisfying sight of it, perched woodpecker-wise  on a mossy trunk, busy at its old fascinating occupation of deftly  picking off the running ants.    It is melancholy to think that this quaint and beautiful bird of a  unique type has been growing less and less common in our country during  the last half a century, or for a longer period. In the last fifteen or  twenty years the falling-off has been very marked. The declension is not  attributable to persecution in this case, since the bird is not on the  gamekeeper's black list, nor has it yet become so rare as to cause the  amateur collectors of dead birds throughout the country systematically  to set about its extermination. Doubtless that will come later on when  it will be in the same category with the golden oriole, hoopoe,  furze-wren, and other species that are regarded as always worth killing;  that is to say, it will come--the scramble for the wryneck's  carcass--if nothing is done in the meantime to restrain the enthusiasm  of those who value a bird only when the spirit of life that gave it  flight and grace and beauty has been crushed out of it--when it is no  longer a bird. The cause of its decline up till now cannot be known to  us; we can only say in our ignorance that this type, like innumerable  others that have ceased to exist, has probably run its course and is  dying out. Or it might be imagined that its system is undergoing some  slow change, which tells on the migratory instinct, that it is becoming  more a resident species in its winter home in Africa. But all  conjectures are idle in such a case. It is melancholy, at all events for  the ornithologist, to think of an England without a wryneck; but before  that still distant day arrives let us hope that the love of birds will  have become a common feeling in the mass of the population, and that the  variety of our bird life will have been increased by the addition of  some chance colonists and of many new species introduced from distant  regions.    I have lingered long over the wryneck, but have still a story to relate  of this bird--not a fairy tale this time, but true.    On the border of the village adjoining the wood--the side where birds  were more abundant, and which consequently had the greatest attraction  for me--there stands an old picturesque cottage nearly concealed from  sight by the hedge in front and closely planted trees clustering round  it. On one side was a grass field, on the other an orchard of old  cherry, apple, and plum trees, all the property of the old man living in  the cottage, who was a character in his way; at all events, he had not  been fashioned in quite the same mould as the majority of the cottagers  about him. They mostly, when past middle life, wore a heavy, dull and  somewhat depressed look. This man had a twinkle in his dark-grey eyes,  an expression of intelligent curiosity and fellowship; and his full  face, bronzed with sixty or sixty-five years' exposure to the weather,  was genial, as if the sunshine that had so long beaten on it had not  been all used up in painting his skin that rich old-furniture colour,  but had, some of it, filtered through the epidermis into the heart to  make his existence pleasant and sweet. But it was a very rough-cast  face, with shapeless nose and thick lips. He was short and  broad-shouldered, always in the warm weather in his shirt-sleeves, a  shirt of some very coarse material and of an earthen colour, his brown  thick arms bare to the elbows. Waistcoat and trousers looked as if he  had worn them for half his life, and had a marbled or mottled appearance  as if they had taken the various tints of all the objects and materials  he had handled or rubbed against in his life's work--wood, mossy trees,  grass, clay, bricks, stone, rusty iron, and dozens more. He wore the  field-labourer's thick boots; his ancient rusty felt hat had long lost  its original shape; and finally, to complete the portrait, a short black  clay pipe was never out of his lips--never, at all events, when I saw  him, which was often; for every day as I strolled past his domain he  would be on the outside of his hedge, or just coming out of his gate,  invariably with something in his hand--a spade, a fork, or stick of  wood, or an old empty fruit-basket. Although thus having the appearance  of being very much occupied, he would always stop for a few minutes'  talk with me; and by-and-by I began to suspect that he was a very social  sort of person, and that it pleased him to have a little chat, but that  he liked to have me think that he met me by accident while going about  his work.    One sunny morning as I came past his field he came out bearing a huge  bundle of green grass on his head. \"What!\" he exclaimed, coming to a  stand, \"you here to-day? I thought you'd be away to the regatta.\"    I said that I knew little about regattas and cared less, that a day  spent in watching and listening to the birds gave me more pleasure than  all the regattas in the country. \"I suppose you can't understand that?\"  I added.    He took the big green bundle from his head and set it down, pulled off  his old hat to flap the dust out of it, then sucked at his short clay.  \"Well,\" he said at length, \"some fancies one thing and some another, but  we most of us like a regatta.\"    During the talk that followed I asked him if he knew the wryneck, and if  it ever nested in his orchard. He did not know the bird; had never heard  its name nor the other names of snake-bird and cuckoo's mate; and when I  had minutely described its appearance, he said that no such bird was  known in the village.    I assured him that he was mistaken, that I had heard the cry of the bird  many times, and had even heard it once at a distance since our  conversation began. Hearing that distant cry had caused me to ask the  question.    All at once he remembered that he knew, or had known formerly, the  wryneck very well, but he had never learnt its name. About twenty or  five-and-twenty years ago, he said, he saw the bird I had just described  in his orchard, and as it appeared day after day and had a strange  appearance as it moved up the tree trunks, he began to be interested in  it. One day he saw it fly into a hole close to the ground in an old  apple tree. \"Now I've got you!\" he exclaimed, and running to the spot  thrust his hand in as far as he could, but was unable to reach the bird.  Then he conceived the idea of starving it out, and stopped up the hole  with clay. The following day at the same hour he again put in his hand,  and this time succeeded in taking the bird. So strange was it to him  that after showing it to his own family he took it round to exhibit it  to his neighbours, and although some of them were old men, not one among  them had ever seen its like before. They concluded that it was a kind of  nuthatch, but unlike the common nuthatch which they knew. After they had  all seen and handled it and had finished the discussions about it, he  released it and saw it fly away; but, to his astonishment, it was back  in his orchard a few hours later. In a few weeks it brought out its five  or six young from the hole he had caught it in, and for several years it  returned each season to breed in the same hole until the tree was blown  down, after which the bird was seen no more.    What an experience the poor bird had suffered! First plastered up and  left to starve or suffocate in its hollow tree; then captured and passed  round from rough, horny hand to hand, while the villagers were  discussing it in their slow, ponderous fashion--how wildly its little  wild heart must have palpitated!--and, finally, after being released, to  go back at once to its eggs in that dangerous tree. I do not know which  surprised me most, the bird's action in returning to its nest after such  inhospitable treatment, or the ignorance of the villagers concerning it.  The incident seemed to show that the wryneck had been scarce at this  place for a very long period.    The villager, as a rule, is not a good observer, which is not strange,  since no person is, or ever can be, a good observer of the things in  which he is not specially interested; consequently the countryman only  knows the most common and the most conspicuous species."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7386"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: First series, IVth to XIIth dynasty (#8)"],[1,"of Egypt.\" He said thus for that he knew of my  excellence, and had heard tell of my worth, for men of Egypt who were  there with him bore witness of me. Behold he said to me, \"For what cause  hast thou come hither? Has a matter come to pass in the palace? Has the  king of the two lands, Sehetep-abra gone to heaven? That which has  happened about this is not known.\" But I answered with concealment, and  said, \"When I came from the land of the Tamahu, and my desires were  there changed in me, if I fled away it was not by reason of remorse that  I took the way of a fugitive; I have not failed in my duty, my mouth has  not said any bitter words, I have not heard any evil counsel, my name  has not come into the mouth of a magistrate. I know not by what I have  been led into this land.\" And Amu-an-shi said, \"This is by the will of  the god (king of Egypt), for what is a land like if it know not that  excellent god, of whom the dread is upon the lands of strangers, as  they dread Sekhet in a year of pestilence.\" I spake to him, and  replied, \"Forgive me, his son now enters the palace, and has received  the heritage of his father. He is a god who has none like him, and  there is none before him. He is a master of wisdom, prudent in his  designs, excellent in his decrees, with good-will to him who goes or  who comes; he subdued the land of strangers while his father yet lived  in his palace, and he rendered account of that which his father  destined him to perform. He is a brave man, who verily strikes with  his sword; a valiant one, who has not his equal; he springs upon the  barbarians, and throws himself on the spoilers; he breaks the horns  and weakens the hands, and those whom he smites cannot raise the  buckler. He is fearless, and dashes the heads, and none can stand  before him. He is swift of foot, to destroy him who flies; and none  who flees from him reaches his home. His heart is strong in his time;  he is a lion who strikes with the claw, and never has he turned his  back. His heart is closed to pity; and when he sees multitudes, he  leaves none to live behind him. He is a valiant one who springs in  front when he sees resistance; he is a warrior who rejoices when he  flies on the barbarians. He seizes the buckler, he rushes forward, he  never needs to strike again, he slays and none can turn his lance; and  when he takes the bow the barbarians flee from his arms like dogs; for  the great goddess has given to him to strike those who know her not;  and if he reaches forth he spares none, and leaves nought behind. He  is a friend of great sweetness, who knows how to gain love; his land  loves him more than itself, and rejoices in him more than in its own  god; men and women run to his call. A king, he has ruled from his  birth; he, from his birth, has increased births, a sole being, a  divine essence, by whom this land rejoices to be governed. He enlarges  the borders of the South, but he covets not the lands of the North;  he does not smite the Sati, nor crush the Nemau-shau If he descends  here, let him know thy name, by the homage which thou wilt pay to his  majesty. For he refuses not to bless the land which obeys him.\"    And he replied to me, \"Egypt is indeed happy and well settled; behold  thou art far from it, but whilst thou art with me I will do good unto  thee.\" And he placed me before his children, he married his eldest  daughter to me, and gave me the choice of all his land, even among the  best of that which he had on the border of the next land. It is a goodly  land, laa is its name. There are figs and grapes; there is wine commoner  than water; abundant is the honey, many are its olives; and all fruits  are upon its trees; there is barley and wheat, and cattle of kinds  without end. This was truly a great thing that he granted me, when the  prince came to invest me, and establish me as prince of a tribe in the  best of his land. I had my continual portion of bread and of wine each  day, of cooked meat, of roasted fowl, as well as the wild game which I  took, or which was brought to me, besides what my dogs captured. They  made me much butter, and prepared milk of all kinds. I passed many  years, the children that I had became great, each ruling his tribe.  When a messenger went or came to the palace, he turned aside from the  way to come to me; for I helped every man. I gave water to the  thirsty, I set on his way him who went astray, and I rescued the  robbed. The Sati who went far, to strike and turn back the princes of  other lands, I ordained their goings; for the Prince of the Tenu for  many years appointed me to be general of his soldiers. In every land  which I attacked I played the champion, I took the cattle, I led away  the vassals, I carried off the slaves, I slew the people, by my sword,  my bow, my marches and my good devices. I was excellent to the heart  of my prince; he loved me when he knew my power, and set me over his  children when he saw the strength of my arms.    A champion of the Tenu came to defy me in my tent: a bold man without  equal, for he had vanquished the whole country. He said, \"Let Sanehat  fight with me;\" for he desired to overthrow me, he thought to take my  cattle for his tribe. The prince counselled with me. I said, \"I know  him not. I certainly am not of his degree, I hold me far from his  place. Have I ever opened his door, or leaped over his fence? It is  some envious jealousy from seeing me; does he think that I am like  some steer among the cows, whom the bull overthrows? If this is a  wretch who thinks to enrich himself at my cost, not a Bedawi and a  Bedawi fit for fight, then let us put the matter to judgment. Verily a  true bull loves battle, but a vain-glorious bull turns his back for  fear of contest; if he has a heart for combat, let him speak what he  pleases. Will God forget what He has ordained, and how shall that be  known?\" I lay down; and when I had rested I strung my bow, I made  ready my arrows, I loosened my poignard, I furbished my arms. At dawn  the land of the Tenu came together; it had gathered its tribes and  called all the neighbouring people, it spake of nothing but the fight.  Each heart burnt for me, men and women crying out; for each heart was  troubled for me, and they said, \"Is there another strong one who would  fight with him? Behold the adversary has a buckler, a battle axe, and  an armful of javelins.\" Then I drew him to the attack; I turned aside  his arrows, and they struck the ground in vain. One drew near to the  other, and he fell on me, and then I shot him. My arrow fastened in  his neck, he cried out, and fell on his face: I drove his lance into  him, and raised my shout of victory on his back. Whilst all the men of  the land rejoiced, I, and his vassals whom he had oppressed, gave  thanks unto Mentu. This prince, Amu-an-shi, embraced me. Then I  carried off his goods and took his cattle, that which he had wished to  do to me, I did even so unto him; I seized that which was in his tent,  I spoiled his dwelling. As time went on I increased the richness of my  treasures and the number of my cattle.    _Petition to the king of Egypt._    \"Now behold what the god has done for me who trusted in him. Having once  fled away, yet now there is a witness of me in the palace. Once having  fled away, as a fugitive,------now all in the palace give unto me a good  name. After that I had been dying of hunger, now I give bread to those  around. I had left my land naked, and now I am clothed in fine linen.  After having been a wanderer without followers, now I possess many  serfs. My house is fine, my land wide, my memory is established in the  temple of all the gods. And let this flight obtain thy forgiveness;  that I may be appointed in the palace; that I may see the place where  my heart dwells. How great a thing is it that my body should be  embalmed in the land where I was born! To return there is happiness. I  have made offering to God, to grant me this thing. His heart suffers  who has run away unto a strange land. Let him hear the prayer of him  who is afar off, that he may revisit the place of his birth, and the  place from which he removed.    \"May the king of Egypt be gracious to me that I may live of his favour.  And I render my homage to the mistress of the land, who is in his  palace; may I hear the news of her children. Thus will my limbs grow  young again. Now old age comes, feebleness seizes me, my eyes are  heavy, my arms are feeble, my legs will not move, my heart is slow.  Death draws nigh to me, soon shall they lead me to the city of  eternity. Let me follow the mistress of all (the queen, his former  mistress); lo! let her tell me the excellencies of her children; may  she bring eternity to me.\"    Then the majesty of King Kheper-ka-ra, the blessed, spake upon this my  desire that I had made to him. His majesty sent unto me with presents  from the king, that he might enlarge the heart of his servant, like unto  the province of any strange land; and the royal sons who are in the  palace addressed themselves unto me.    _Copy of the decree which was brought--to me who speak to you--to lead  me back into Egypt._    \"The Horus, life of births, lord of the crowns, life of births, king  of Upper and Lower Egypt, Kheper-ka-ra, son of the Sun, Amen-em-hat,  ever living unto eternity.
