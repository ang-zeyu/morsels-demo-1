CHAPTER V. HOW A STRANGE COMPANY GATHERED AT THE \"PIED MERLIN.\"      The night had already fallen, and the moon was shining between the rifts  of ragged, drifting clouds, before Alleyne Edricson, footsore and weary  from the unwonted exercise, found himself in front of the forest inn  which stood upon the outskirts of Lyndhurst. The building was long and  low, standing back a little from the road, with two flambeaux blazing on  either side of the door as a welcome to the traveller. From one window  there thrust forth a long pole with a bunch of greenery tied to the end  of it--a sign that liquor was to be sold within. As Alleyne walked up to  it he perceived that it was rudely fashioned out of beams of wood, with  twinkling lights all over where the glow from within shone through the  chinks. The roof was poor and thatched; but in strange contrast to  it there ran all along under the eaves a line of wooden shields, most  gorgeously painted with chevron, bend, and saltire, and every heraldic  device. By the door a horse stood tethered, the ruddy glow beating  strongly upon his brown head and patient eyes, while his body stood back  in the shadow.    Alleyne stood still in the roadway for a few minutes reflecting  upon what he should do. It was, he knew, only a few miles further to  Minstead, where his brother dwelt. On the other hand, he had never seen  this brother since childhood, and the reports which had come to his ears  concerning him were seldom to his advantage. By all accounts he was a  hard and a bitter man.    It might be an evil start to come to his door so late and claim the  shelter of his roof. Better to sleep here at this inn, and then travel  on to Minstead in the morning. If his brother would take him in, well  and good.    He would bide with him for a time and do what he might to serve him.  If, on the other hand, he should have hardened his heart against him,  he could only go on his way and do the best he might by his skill as  a craftsman and a scrivener. At the end of a year he would be free  to return to the cloisters, for such had been his father's bequest. A  monkish upbringing, one year in the world after the age of twenty, and  then a free selection one way or the other--it was a strange course  which had been marked out for him. Such as it was, however, he had no  choice but to follow it, and if he were to begin by making a friend  of his brother he had best wait until morning before he knocked at his  dwelling.    The rude plank door was ajar, but as Alleyne approached it there came  from within such a gust of rough laughter and clatter of tongues that  he stood irresolute upon the threshold. Summoning courage, however, and  reflecting that it was a public dwelling, in which he had as much right  as any other man, he pushed it open and stepped into the common room.    Though it was an autumn evening and somewhat warm, a huge fire of heaped  billets of wood crackled and sparkled in a broad, open grate, some of  the smoke escaping up a rude chimney, but the greater part rolling out  into the room, so that the air was thick with it, and a man coming from  without could scarce catch his breath. On this fire a great cauldron  bubbled and simmered, giving forth a rich and promising smell. Seated  round it were a dozen or so folk, of all ages and conditions, who set  up such a shout as Alleyne entered that he stood peering at them through  the smoke, uncertain what this riotous greeting might portend.    \"A rouse! A rouse!\" cried one rough looking fellow in a tattered jerkin.  \"One more round of mead or ale and the score to the last comer.\"    \"'Tis the law of the 'Pied Merlin,'\" shouted another. \"Ho there, Dame  Eliza! Here is fresh custom come to the house, and not a drain for the  company.\"    \"I will take your orders, gentles; I will assuredly take your orders,\"  the landlady answered, bustling in with her hands full of leathern  drinking-cups. \"What is it that you drink, then? Beer for the lads of  the forest, mead for the gleeman, strong waters for the tinker, and wine  for the rest. It is an old custom of the house, young sir. It has been  the use at the 'Pied Merlin' this many a year back that the company  should drink to the health of the last comer. Is it your pleasure to  humor it?\"    \"Why, good dame,\" said Alleyne, \"I would not offend the customs of your  house, but it is only sooth when I say that my purse is a thin one. As  far as two pence will go, however, I shall be right glad to do my part.\"    \"Plainly said and bravely spoken, my suckling friar,\" roared a deep  voice, and a heavy hand fell upon Alleyne's shoulder. Looking up, he saw  beside him his former cloister companion the renegade monk, Hordle John.    \"By the thorn of Glastonbury! ill days are coming upon Beaulieu,\" said  he. \"Here they have got rid in one day of the only two men within their  walls--for I have had mine eyes upon thee, youngster, and I know that  for all thy baby-face there is the making of a man in thee. Then there  is the Abbot, too. I am no friend of his, nor he of mine; but he has  warm blood in his veins. He is the only man left among them. The others,  what are they?\"    \"They are holy men,\" Alleyne answered gravely.    \"Holy men? Holy cabbages! Holy bean-pods! What do they do but live and  suck in sustenance and grow fat? If that be holiness, I could show you  hogs in this forest who are fit to head the calendar. Think you it was  for such a life that this good arm was fixed upon my shoulder, or that  head placed upon your neck? There is work in the world, man, and it is  not by hiding behind stone walls that we shall do it.\"    \"Why, then, did you join the brothers?\" asked Alleyne.    \"A fair enough question; but it is as fairly answered. I joined them  because Margery Alspaye, of Bolder, married Crooked Thomas of Ringwood,  and left a certain John of Hordle in the cold, for that he was a  ranting, roving blade who was not to be trusted in wedlock. That was  why, being fond and hot-headed, I left the world; and that is why,  having had time to take thought, I am right glad to find myself back in  it once more. Ill betide the day that ever I took off my yeoman's jerkin  to put on the white gown!\"    Whilst he was speaking the landlady came in again, bearing a broad  platter, upon which stood all the beakers and flagons charged to the  brim with the brown ale or the ruby wine. Behind her came a maid with  a high pile of wooden plates, and a great sheaf of spoons, one of which  she handed round to each of the travellers. Two of the company, who were  dressed in the weather-stained green doublet of foresters, lifted the  big pot off the fire, and a third, with a huge pewter ladle, served out  a portion of steaming collops to each guest. Alleyne bore his share and  his ale-mug away with him to a retired trestle in the corner, where he  could sup in peace and watch the strange scene, which was so different  to those silent and well-ordered meals to which he was accustomed.    The room was not unlike a stable. The low ceiling, smoke-blackened and  dingy, was pierced by several square trap-doors with rough-hewn ladders  leading up to them. The walls of bare unpainted planks were studded  here and there with great wooden pins, placed at irregular intervals  and heights, from which hung over-tunics, wallets, whips, bridles, and  saddles. Over the fireplace were suspended six or seven shields of  wood, with coats-of-arms rudely daubed upon them, which showed by their  varying degrees of smokiness and dirt that they had been placed there  at different periods. There was no furniture, save a single long  dresser covered with coarse crockery, and a number of wooden benches and  trestles, the legs of which sank deeply into the soft clay floor, while  the only light, save that of the fire, was furnished by three torches  stuck in sockets on the wall, which flickered and crackled, giving  forth a strong resinous odor. All this was novel and strange to the  cloister-bred youth; but most interesting of all was the motley circle  of guests who sat eating their collops round the blaze. They were a  humble group of wayfarers, such as might have been found that night  in any inn through the length and breadth of England; but to him they  represented that vague world against which he had been so frequently and  so earnestly warned. It did not seem to him from what he could see of it  to be such a very wicked place after all.    Three or four of the men round the fire were evidently underkeepers  and verderers from the forest, sunburned and bearded, with the quick  restless eye and lithe movements of the deer among which they lived.  Close to the corner of the chimney sat a middle-aged gleeman, clad in a  faded garb of Norwich cloth, the tunic of which was so outgrown that it  did not fasten at the neck and at the waist. His face was swollen and  coarse, and his watery protruding eyes spoke of a life which never  wandered very far from the wine-pot. A gilt harp, blotched with many  stains and with two of its strings missing, was tucked under one of his  arms, while with the other he scooped greedily at his platter. Next to  him sat two other men of about the same age, one with a trimming of fur  to his coat, which gave him a dignity which was evidently dearer to him  than his comfort, for he still drew it round him in spite of the hot  glare of the faggots. The other, clad in a dirty russet suit with a long  sweeping doublet, had a cunning, foxy face with keen, twinkling eyes and  a peaky beard. Next to him sat Hordle John, and beside him three other  rough unkempt fellows with tangled beards and matted hair--free laborers  from the adjoining farms, where small patches of freehold property  had been suffered to remain scattered about in the heart of the royal  demesne. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#8)"],[1,"poetry of the open road, a  poetry which we have lost for ever.    How amusing they were, the African roads of those days, how full of sights!  Pauses were made at inns with walls thick as the ramparts of citadels,  their interiors bordered by stables built in arcades, heaped up with  travellers' packs and harness. In the centre were the trough and cistern;  and to the little rooms opening in a circle on to the balcony, drifted up  a smell of oil and fodder, and the noise of men and of beasts of burthen,  and of the camels as they entered majestically, curving their long necks  under the lintel of the door. Then there was talk with the merchants, just  arrived from the south, who brought news of the nomad countries, and had  stories to tell. And then, without hurrying, a start was made again for the  next stage. Long files of chariots were encountered carrying provisions to  soldiers garrisoned on the frontier, or the State-distributed corn of the  Roman people to the sea-ports; or again, from time to time, the _lectica_,  brought along by slaves or mules, of a bishop on a visitation; and then the  litter, with close-drawn curtains, of a matron or some great personage. Of  a sudden all pulled sharp to one side; the vehicles lined up on the edge of  the road; and there passed at full speed, in a cloud of dust, a messenger  of the Imperial Post....    Certainly this road from Hippo to Theveste was one of the busiest and most  picturesque in the province: it was one of its main arteries.    At first the look of the country is rather like the neighbourhood of  Thagaste. The wooded and mountainous landscape still spreads out its  little breast-shaped hills and its sheets of verdure. Here and there the  road skirts the deeply-ravined valley of the Medjerda. At the foot of the  precipitous slopes, the river can be heard brawling in a torrent over its  stony bed, and there are sharp descents among thickets of juniper and the  fringed roots of the dwarf-pines. Then, as the descent continues, the land  becomes thinner and spaces bare of vegetation appear oftener. At last, upon  a piece of tableland, Madaura comes into view, all white in the midst of  the vast tawny plain, where to-day nothing is to be seen but a mausoleum  in ruins, the remains of a Byzantine fortress, and vague traces vanishing  away.    This is the first rise of the great plain which declines towards Theveste  and the group of the Aures Mountains. Coming from the woodland country of  Thagaste, the nakedness of it is startling. Here and there, thin cows crop  starveling shrubs which have grown on the bank of some _oued_ run dry.  Little asses, turned loose, save themselves at a gallop towards the tents  of the nomads, spread out, black and hairy, like immense bats on the  whiteness of the land. Nearer, a woman's red _haick_ interposes, the single  stain of bright colour breaking the indefinite brown and grey of the plain.  Here is felt the harshness of Numidia; it is almost the stark spaces of  the desert world. But on the side towards the east, the architecture of  mountains, wildly sculptured, stands against the level reaches of the  horizon. Upon the clear background of the sky, shew, distinctly, lateral  spurs and a cone like to the mystic representation of Tanit. Towards the  south, crumbling isolated crags appear, scattered about like gigantic  pedestals uncrowned of their statues, or like the pipes of an organ raised  there to capture and attune the cry of the great winds of the _steppe_.    This country is characterized by a different kind of energy from Thagaste.  There is more air and light and space. If the plantation is sparse, the  beautiful shape of the land may be observed all the better. Nothing breaks  or lessens the grand effects of the light.... And let no one say that  Augustin's eyes cared not for all that, he who wrote after his conversion,  and in all the austerity of his repentance: \"If sentient things had not a  soul, we should not love them so much.\"    It is here, between Madaura and Thagaste, during the eager years of youth,  that he gathered together the seeds of sensations and images which,  later on, were to burst forth into fiery and boiling metaphors in the  _Confessions_, and in his homilies and paraphrases of Holy Scripture. Later  on, he will not have the time to observe, or he will have lost the power.  Rhetoric will stretch its commonplace veil between him and the unceasing  springtide of the earth. Ambition will turn him away from those sights  which reveal themselves only to hearts unselfish and indifferent. Then,  later on, Faith will seize hold of him to the exclusion of all else. He  will no longer perceive the creation save at odd moments in a kind of  metaphysical dream, and, so to speak, across the glory of the Creator.  But in these youthful years all things burst upon him with extraordinary  violence and ecstasy. His undulled senses swallowed greedily the whole  banquet offered by this wide world to his hunger for pleasure. The fugitive  beauty of things and beings, with all their charms, revealed itself to  him in its newness: _novissimarum rerum fugaces pulchritudines, earumque  suavitates_. This craving for sensation will still exist in the great  Christian teacher, and betray itself in the warm and coloured figures  of his style. Of course, he was not as a worldly describer, who studies  to produce phrases which present an image, or arranges glittering  pictures--all such endeavours he knew nothing about. But by instinct, and  thanks to his warm African temperament, he was a kind of impressionist and  metaphysical poet.    If the rural landscape of Thagaste is reflected in certain passages--the  pleasantest and most well known--of the _Confessions_, all the intellectual  part of Augustin's work finds its symbolical commentary here in this arid  and light-splashed plain of Madaura. Like it, the thought of Augustin has  no shadows. Like it too, it is lightened by strange and splendid tints  which seem to come from far off, from a focal fire invisible to human eyes.  No modern writer has better praised the light--not only the immortal light  of the blessed, but that light which rests on the African fields, and  is on land and sea; and nobody has spoken of it with more amplitude and  wonder. The truth is, that in no country in the world, not even in Egypt,  in the rose-coloured lands of Karnak and Luxor, is the light more pure and  admirable than in these great bare plains of Numidia and the region of the  Sahara. Is there not enchantment for the eyes of the metaphysician in this  play of light, these nameless interfulgent colours which appear flimsy as  the play of thought? For the glowing floating haze is made of nothing--of  lines, of gleam, of unregulated splendour. And all this triumph of  fluctuating light and elusive colour is quenched with the sun, smoulders  into darkness, even as ideas in the obscure depths of the intelligence  which reposes....    Not less than this land, stern even to sadness, but hot and sumptuous, the  town of Madaura must have impressed Augustin.    It was an old Numidian city, proud of its antiquity. Long before the Roman  conquest, it had been a fortress of King Syphax. Afterwards, the conquerors  settled there, and in the second century of our era, Apuleius, the most  famous of its children, could state before a proconsul, not without pride,  that Madaura was a very prosperous colony. It is probable that this old  town was not so much Romanized as its neighbours, Thimgad and Lambesa,  which were of recent foundation and had been built all at once by decree of  the Government. But it may well have been as Roman as Theveste, a no less  ancient city, where the population was probably just as mixed. Madaura,  like Theveste, had its temples with pillars and Corinthian porticoes, its  triumphal arches (these were run up everywhere), its forum surrounded by a  covered gallery and peopled with statues. Statues also were very liberally  distributed in those days. We know of at least three at Madaura which  Augustin mentions in one of his letters: A god Mars in his heroic  nakedness, and another Mars armed from head to foot; opposite, the statue  of a man, in realistic style, stretching out three fingers to neutralize  the evil eye. These familiar figures remained very clear in the  recollection of Augustin. In the evening, or at the hour of the siesta, he  had stretched himself under their pedestals and played at dice or bones in  the cool shade of the god Mars, or of the Man with outstretched fingers.  The slabs of marble of the portico made a good place to play or sleep.    Among these statues, there was one perhaps which interested the lad and  stimulated all his early ambitions--that of Apuleius, the great man of  Madaura, the orator, philosopher, sorcerer, who was spoken of from one end  to the other of Africa. By dint of gazing at this, and listening to the  praises of the great local author, did the young scholar become aware of  his vocation? Did he have from this time a confused sort of wish to become  one day another Apuleius, a Christian Apuleius--to surpass the reputation  of this celebrated pagan? These impressions and admirations of youth have  always a more or less direct influence upon what use a boy makes of his  talents.    Be that as it will, Augustin could not take a step in Madaura without  running against the legend of Apuleius, who was become almost a divinity  for his fellow-countrymen. He was looked upon not only as a sage, but as  a most wily nigromancer. The pagans compared him to Christ--nay, put him  higher than Christ. In their view he had worked much more astonishing  miracles than those of Jesus or of Apollonius of Tyana. And people told the  extravagant stories out of his _Metamorphoses_ as real, as having actually  happened. Nothing was seen on all sides but wizards, men changed into  animals, animals, or men and women, under some spell. In "]]]
