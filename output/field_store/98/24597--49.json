He was a soldier to the last. He was  one of God's greatest noblemen, and I think I can say he was an example  of bravery even to men on the ship.\"      LAST WORDS OF MAJOR BUTT    Miss Marie Young, who was a music instructor to President Roosevelt's  children and had known Major Butt during the Roosevelt occupancy of the  White House, told this story of his heroism.    \"Archie himself put me into the boat, wrapped blankets about me and  tucked me in as carefully as if we were starting on a motor ride. He,  himself, entered the boat with me, performing the little courtesies as  calmly and with as smiling a face as if death were far away, instead of  being but a few moments removed from him.    \"When he had carefully wrapped me up he stepped upon the gunwale of the  boat, and lifting his hat, smiled down at me. 'Good-bye, Miss Young,'  he said. 'Good luck to you, and don't forget to remember me to the folks  back home.' Then he stepped back and waved his hand to me as the boat  was lowered. I think I was the last woman he had a chance to help, for  the boat went down shortly after we cleared the suction zone.\"    COLONEL ASTOR ANOTHER HERO    Colonel Astor was another of the heroes of the awful night. Effort was  made to persuade him to take a place in one of the life-boats, but he  emphatically refused to do so until every woman and child on board  had been provided for, not excepting the women members of the ship's  company.    One of the passengers describing the consummate courage of Colonel Astor  said:    \"He led Mrs. Astor to the side of the ship and helped her to the  life-boat to which she had been assigned. I saw that she was prostrated  and said she would remain and take her chances with him, but Colonel  Astor quietly insisted and tried to reassure her in a few words. As she  took her place in the boat her eyes were fixed upon him. Colonel Astor  smiled, touched his cap, and when the boat moved safely away from the  ship's side he turned back to his place among the men.\"    Mrs. Ida S. Hippach and her daughter Jean, survivors of the Titanic,  said they were saved by Colonel John Jacob Astor, who forced the crew of  the last life-boat to wait for them.    \"We saw Colonel Astor place Mrs. Astor in a boat and assure her that he  would follow later,\" said Mrs. Hippach.    \"He turned to us with a smile and said, 'Ladies, you are next.' The  officer in charge of the boat protested that the craft was full, and the  seamen started to lower it.    \"Colonel Astor exclaimed, 'Hold that boat,' in the voice of a man  accustomed to be obeyed, and they did as he ordered. The boat had been  lowered past the upper deck and the colonel took us to the deck below  and put us in the boat, one after the other, through a port-hole.\"      {illust. caption = LOADING THE LIFE-BOATS    Here occurred the heart-rending separation of husbands and wives, as the  women were given precedence in the boats.}      HEART-BREAKING SCENES    There were some terrible scenes. Fathers were parting from their  children and giving them an encouraging pat on the shoulders; men  were kissing their wives and telling them that they would be with them  shortly. One man said there was absolutely no danger, that the boat was  the finest ever built, with water-tight compartments, and that it could  not sink. That seemed to be the general impression.    A few of the men, however, were panic-stricken even when the first of  the fifty-six foot life-boats was being filled. Fully ten men threw  themselves into the boats already crowded with women and children. These  men were dragged back and hurled sprawling across the deck. Six of them,  screamed with fear, struggled to their feet and made a second attempt to  rush to the boats.    About ten shots sounded in quick succession. The six cowardly men were  stopped in their tracks, staggered and collapsed one after another. At  least two of them vainly attempted to creep toward the boats again. The  others lay quite still. This scene of bloodshed served its purpose.  In that particular section of the deck there was no further attempt to  violate the rule of \"women and children first.\"    \"I helped fill the boats with women,\" said Thomas Whiteley, who was a  waiter on the Titanic. \"Collapsible boat No. 2 on the starboard jammed.  The second officer was hacking at the ropes with a knife and I was being  dragged around the deck by that rope when I looked up and saw the boat,  with all aboard, turn turtle. In some way I got overboard myself and  clung to an oak dresser. I wasn't more than sixty feet from the Titanic  when she went down. Her big stern rose up in the air and she went down  bow first. I saw all the machinery drop out of her.\"      HENRY B. HARRIS    Henry B. Harris, of New York, a theatrical manager, was one of the men  who showed superb courage in the crisis. When the life-boats were first  being filled, and before there was any panic, Mr. Harris went to the  side of his wife before the boat was lowered away.    \"Women first,\" shouted one of the ship's officers. Mr. Harris glanced up  and saw that the remark was addressed to him.    \"All right,\" he replied coolly. \"Good-bye, my dear,\" he said, as he  kissed his wife, pressed her a moment to his breast, and then climbed  back to the Titanic's deck.      THREE EXPLOSIONS    Up to this time there had been no panic; but about one hour before  the ship plunged to the bottom there were three separate explosions of  bulkheads as the vessel filled. These were at intervals of about fifteen  minutes. From that time there was a different scene. The rush for the  remaining boats became a stampede.    The stokers rushed up from below and tried to beat a path through the  steerage men and women and through the sailors and officers, to get into  the boats. They had their iron bars and shovels, and they struck down  all who stood in their way.    The first to come up from the depths of the ship was an engineer. From  what he is reported to have said it is probable that the steam fittings  were broken and many were scalded to death when the Titanic lifted. He  said he had to dash through a narrow place beside a broken pipe and his  back was frightfully scalded.    Right at his heels came the stokers. The officers had pistols, but they  could not use them at first for fear of killing the women and children.  The sailors fought with their fists and many of them took the stoke bars  and shovels from the stokers and used them to beat back the others.    Many of the coal-passers and stokers who had been driven back from  the boats went to the rail, and whenever a boat was filled and lowered  several of them jumped overboard and swam toward it trying to climb  aboard. Several of the survivors said that men who swam to the sides of  their boats were pulled in or climbed in.    Dozens of the cabin passengers were witnesses of some of the frightful  scenes on the steerage deck. The steerage survivors said that ten women  from the upper decks were the only cool passengers in the life-boat, and  they tried to quiet the steerage women, who were nearly all crazed with  fear and grief.      OTHER HEROES    Among the chivalrous young heroes of the Titanic disaster were  Washington A. Roebling, 2d, and Howard Case, London representative of  the Vacuum Oil Company. Both were urged repeatedly to take places in  life-boats, but scorned the opportunity, while working against time to  save the women aboard the ill-fated ship. They went to their death, it  is said by survivors, with smiles on their faces.    Both of these young men aided in the saving of Mrs. William T. Graham,  wife of the president of the American Can Company, and Mrs. Graham's  nineteen-year-old daughter, Margaret.    Afterwards relating some of her experiences Mrs. Graham said:    \"There was a rap at the door. It was a passenger whom we had met shortly  after the ship left Liverpool, and his name was Roebling--Washington A.  Roebling, 2d. He was a gentleman and a brave man. He warned us of  the danger and told us that it would be best to be prepared for an  emergency. We heeded his warning, and I looked out of my window and saw  a great big iceberg facing us. Immediately I knew what had happened and  we lost no time after that to get out into the saloon.    \"In one of the gangways I met an officer of the ship.    \"'What is the matter?' I asked him.    \"'We've only burst two pipes,' he said. 'Everything is all right, don't  worry.'    \"'But what makes the ship list so?' I asked.    \"'Oh, that's nothing,' he replied, and walked away.    \"Mr. Case advised us to get into a boat.    \"'And what are you going to do?' we asked him.    \"'Oh,' he replied, 'I'll take a chance and stay here.'    \"Just at that time they were filling up the third life-boat on the port  side of the ship. I thought at the time that it was the third boat which  had been lowered, but I found out later that they had lowered other  boats on the other side, where the people were more excited because they  were sinking on that side.    \"Just then Mr. Roebling came up, too, and told us to hurry and get into  the third boat. Mr. Roebling and Mr. Case bustled our party of three  into that boat in less time than it takes to tell it. They were both  working hard to help the women and children. The boat was fairly crowded  when we three were pushed into it, and a few men jumped in at the last  moment, but Mr. Roebling and Mr. Case stood at the rail and made no  attempt to get into the boat.    \"They shouted good-bye to us. What do you think Mr. Case did then? He  just calmly lighted a cigarette and waved us good-bye with his hand.  Mr. Roebling stood there, too--I can see him now. I am sure that he knew  that the ship would go to the bottom. But both just stood there.\"      IN THE FACE OF DEATH    Scenes on the sinking vessel grew more tragic as the remaining  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#8)"],[1," the Macleods. It stood in the more  aristocratic portion of Chagmouth, apart from the town and the fishing,  in company with one or two other newly-built residences. It was  charmingly pretty and artistic, in a perfectly modern fashion, and had  been designed by a famous architect. Its owner, a retired naval officer,  had gone abroad for a year, and had let the place in his absence,  rejoicing to have secured a careful tenant. He might certainly  congratulate himself upon leaving his house in such good hands. Mr.  Macleod was an American gentleman, who, owing to a nervous breakdown, was  travelling in Europe, and happening in the course of the summer to wander  to Chagmouth, he had fallen in love with the quaint old town and had  decided to spend the winter there. The factor which largely influenced  this decision was the presence of Mr. Castleton. Mr. Macleod was an  enthusiastic amateur painter, and the prospect of being able to take  lessons from so good an artist was sufficient to chain him to Chagmouth.  His wife encouraged the idea.    \"George is just miserable if he's nothing to do,\" she explained to her  friends. \"The doctor told me not to let him read too much or take up any  special mental hobby, but sketching strikes the happy medium. He  thoroughly enjoys pottering about in Mr. Castleton's studio, or making  drawings down on the quay. It's not arduous work and yet it keeps him  occupied. I like the house, and Fay can go to school near, so I expect  we're fixed here until next spring at any rate. If I get too bored I  shall run over to Paris and see my sister, but really I haven't been well  lately myself, and it will do me good to take a thorough rest for a  while.\"    Fay, who had formed an enthusiastic friendship with Beata and Romola, was  as pleased with Chagmouth as her parents. From the windows of Bella Vista  she could look across the harbour to The Haven, and had already arranged  a code of signals by which she might communicate with her chums. She was  a bright, amusing girl, rather grown-up for her age, and the constant  companion of her father and mother.    \"Fay runs the house!\" Mrs. Macleod would declare sometimes; but she was  immensely proud of her young daughter, and unwilling to thwart her in any  of the projects which she might care to take up. These, indeed, were  many. Fay dabbled in numerous hobbies, and her demands varied from  photographic materials to special sandals for toe dancing. She thoroughly  enjoyed life, and the freshness of her enthusiasm provided her parents  with a perpetual interest. To those friends who urged boarding-school her  mother was ready with the reply:    \"Why must we be parted from her? She's her father's best tonic! She keeps  him young and makes him laugh. She's getting her education and living her  home life at the same time, and that seems to me ideal. We shall probably  have to spare her later on to be married, so we may as well make the most  of her now while we've got her. It's the chief tragedy of parents that  the children grow up and go away. We'll enjoy our nest while we have our  one chick here. When the young ones are fledged, the old birds stop  singing.\"    [Illustration: MR. CASTLETON DID NOT LOOK AT ALL PLEASED]    Of the other girls who shared the car to Durracombe, Tattie Carew, whose  parents were in India had come to live with her aunt Miss Grant, in the  ivy-covered house at the top of the hill, while Nan and Lizzie Colville  were the daughters of the newly-appointed vicar. All six, therefore, were  fresh comers to the neighbourhood, and as yet had neither explored the  whole of its beauties nor learnt to understand its traditions. In both of  these respects Mavis and Merle, though non-residents, had the advantage  of them. Their friendship with Bevis Talland, the boy who, once the  village foundling, had turned out to be heir to the Chagmouth estate, had  given them an intimate acquaintance with the life of the place. Bevis had  shown them the haunts of the birds, and the best places for wild flowers,  had told them the local legends and the histories of the various worthies  of the parish. The little town indeed seemed strangely empty without him,  but at present he was away at school, and later would be going to  college, though eventually, when he came of age, he would probably take  up his residence in the old family home. The Warren, where Tallands had  lived for so many generations, had been let on a lease to Mr. Glyn  Williams, and the lawyers who managed the property had decided that this  arrangement should be continued during Bevis's minority; heavy death  duties and land-taxes would cripple the estate for some years, and it was  not worth while running a house for the sake of a schoolboy who could  pass only his holidays there. Mr. Glyn Williams meanwhile had bought  Bodoran Hall near Port Sennen, and would have leisure to make all the  many structural alterations which he wished before he was obliged to  leave The Warren. Through Bevis's foster-mother, Mrs. Penruddock of  Grimbal's Farm, where Dr. Tremayne had his branch surgery at Chagmouth,  Mavis and Merle were also kept very much in touch with the tone of the  place and knew most of the little happenings that occurred. They were  friendly with many of the village people, almost all of whom were their  uncle's patients at one time or another, and the Saturday expedition over  the moor from Durracombe was to them the central attraction of the whole  week.    On the first Saturday afternoon of the new term, by special invitation,  they called at The Haven, and made the acquaintance of at least a portion  of the Castleton family. Beata was practising her violin, but she laid it  aside at once.    \"I'll finish my half-hour afterwards. It will do quite as well this  evening. It's too fine a day to stay stuffing inside the house. Do you  care to come into the garden? We can step out through this window. These  are the babies, Constable, Lilith, Perugia, and Gabriel. I was keeping an  eye on them while I practised, to see they weren't in any mischief.  Violet has a headache and is lying down. She's our stepmother, you know.  We don't let the little ones call her Violet though! Come here, Perugia,  and shake hands! She's rather a pet, isn't she?\"    The younger Castletons, from curly-headed Constable, known familiarly as  'Cooney,' to lovely three-year-old Baby Gabriel, were beautiful children,  and looked particularly picturesque in holland play-overalls embroidered  with saxe-blue. Mr. Castleton, who valued artistic effect before  everything, found Constable one of his most useful models, and though the  boy was now seven and a half, he was generally dressed in a Kate  Greenaway smock and his crop of golden curls was still uncut.    \"Don't touch him!\" his father would protest, whenever the question of  Constable's hair arose in the family; \"as he is he's worth an income to  me! He always gets into exhibitions and he generally sells. He's just  what the average British patron wants to buy. The public can't always  understand my allegorical pictures, but they know a pretty child when  they see one. He'll be spoilt for the studio if he loses his curls, and I  want to sketch him as a singing angel, and as a water-baby, and for some  of my Hans Andersen illustrations. It's too bad to ruin his artistic  value just when I've trained him to pose properly. It will be years  before Gabriel learns to sit as still--if he ever does.\"    The little fellow had charmingly attractive manners, and came forward  willingly to talk to visitors. He and Perugia were the talkative ones;  Lilith, a flaxen-haired fairy of six, was very shy, and the baby was busy  with his own affairs and refused to be interrupted.    \"Romola is sitting for Father,\" explained Beata. \"I expect he'd let her  go now though, if you'd care to come for a walk with us. Bother! What  shall I do with the little ones? I can't leave them to Violet when she's  lying down.\"    \"Bring them with you,\" suggested Mavis, who was making friends with  Perugia.    \"Should you mind? I'll tell you what! I'll borrow the donkey from the  farm, then they can ride in turns and won't get tired. Mrs. Donnithorne  is very good-natured about lending it. Constable, you run and ask her,  while we go to fetch Romola. Do you care to come to the studio?\"    Mavis and Merle were only too delighted to have the opportunity of taking  a peep into Mr. Castleton's den, so followed Beata to the old sail-room  down a flight of steps cut in the cliff side. They remembered the place,  for Job Helyar used to plait osiers there, and they had come once to buy  a basket from him. In its former days it had been nothing but a rough  shed. They hardly recognised it now it was turned into a studio. Beata  went boldly in, and introduced her visitors. Her father was painting a  study of Romola for incorporation in a large historical picture. She was  standing on the throne, in a beautiful scarlet mediaeval costume, with  her long fair hair unbound and flowing like an amber waterfall down her  back. Mr. Castleton did not look at all pleased at being interrupted in  his work, but he glanced at his watch and nodded a reluctant permission  to Romola to relieve her pose. She came down from the platform,  stretching her tired arms.    \"I'm supposed to be holding up a casket, and it's a horrid position to  keep,\" she explained. \"May I go now, Dad? We want Mavis and Merle to take  us for a walk. I shan't be three seconds changing out of this costume.  You think the study is like me, Mavis? Show them the sketch for the  picture, Dad! Now you see where my place will be in it--just there. The  little page-boy is Constable, and Violet sat for the queen.\"    While Romola slipped off her mediaeval robe and plaited her long hair,  Beata escorted the visitors back to the garden. She fetched a pair of  field-glasses, took a survey through them, then declared:    \"I can see Fay at"]]]
