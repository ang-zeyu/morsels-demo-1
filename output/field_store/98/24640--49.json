[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#8)"],[1,"we have  already referred to, there are three to which we will direct attention.  Two of these were of astronomical signification: the one adopted when  the Spring Equinox was in the sign of Taurus and shaped like the letter  T, was the model after which the ancient temples were built; and the  other, shaped like the letter X, in reference to the angle of 23 1/2  degrees made by the crossing of the Ecliptic and the Celestial equator,  is known as St. Andrew's Cross. The third, and most important of all  the symbols of solar worship, in its relation to the Christian  religion, which, having no astronomical signification, originated in  Egypt, in reference to the annual inundation of the river Nile. To mark  the height to which the water should rise to secure an abundant  harvest, posts were planted upon its banks to which cross beams were  attached thus +. If the water should rise to the designated height, it  was called \"the waters of life,\" or \"river of life;\" and, ultimately,  this form of the cross was adopted as the symbol of the life to come,  or eternal life; and the ancient astrologers had it engraved upon  stone, encircled with a hieroglyphical inscription to that effect, one  of which was discovered in the ruins of the temple erected at  Alexandria, and dedicated to \"our Lord and Saviour Serapis.\"    But, if the water failed to rise to the required height, and the  horrors of starvation becoming the inevitable result, it was the custom  of the people to nail to these crosses symbolical personifications of  the Demon of Famine. To indicate the sterility of the domain over which  he reigned, he was represented by the figure of a lean and haggard man,  with a crown of thorns upon his head; a reed cut from the river's bank  was placed in his hands, as his unreal sceptre; and, considering the  inhabitants of Judea as the most slavish and mean-spirited race in  their knowledge, they placarded this figure with the inscription: \"This  is the King of the Jews.\" Thus, to the ancient Egyptians, this sign of  the cross was blessed or accursed as it was represented with, or  without, this figure suspended upon it.    When the Roman, or modern, form of Christianity was instituted, the  hieroglyphical inscription signifying the life to come or eternal life  was substituted by a placard nailed to the cross with the letters I. N.  R. I. inscribed upon it, which are the initials of the Latin words  conveying the same meaning. But if we would learn how the figure of a  man came to be suspended upon this form of the cross, we must refer to  Mediaeval History, which teaches that in the year 680, under the  Pontificate of Agathon, and during the reign of Constantine Pogonat, at  the sixth council of the church, and third at Constantinople, it was  ordered in Canon 82 that \"Instead of a lamb, the figure of a man nailed  to a cross should be the distinguishing symbol of the Christian  religion.\" Now, as this figure is represented by that of a lean and  haggard man, with a crown of thorns upon his head, does it not look as  if the old Egyptian Demon of Famine was the model after which it was  constructed?        FUTURE REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.    In the ancient Astrolatry, two different systems of future rewards and  punishments were inculcated; the Oriental or East Indian, and the  Occidental or Egyptian; the former, ignoring the resurrection of the  body, taught but one judgment immediately after death, and the latter  inculcated an individual judgment immediately after death, the  resurrection of the body, and a general judgment at the end of the  world, or conclusion of the 12,000 year cycle.      The Oriental System.    Considering perfect happiness to consist in absolute rest, the Oriental  astrologers conceived a state of eternal and unconscious repose,  equivalent to soul absorption, to which they gave the name of Nirvana,  into which they taught that, by the awards of the gods, the souls of  the righteous, or those who had lived what they called \"the  contemplative life,\" would be permitted to enter immediately after  death. But, for the souls of sinners, they invented a system of  expiatory punishments which, known as the Metempsychosis, or  transmigration of souls, taught that they would be compelled to  successively animate the bodies of beasts, birds, fishes, etc., for a  thousand years before being permitted to enter the Nirvana.      The Occidental System.    In concocting the doctrine of the first judgment the Egyptian  astrologers, ignoring the Nirvana, inculcated the future sentient  existence of the soul; and, while retaining the Metempsychotial  expiations of the Oriental system, taught that its rewards, and  principal punishments, would be enjoyed or suffered in the under or  nether world, the existence of which they had conceived in constructing  their system of nature. This imaginary region, known to the Egyptians  as the Amenti, to the Greeks as Hades, and to the Hebrews as Sheol, was  divided by an impassable gulf into the two states of happiness and  misery which were designated in the Grecian mythology as the Elysium,  or Elysian Fields, and the Tartarus. In the lower part of the latter  was located the Phlegethon, or lake of fire and brimstone, the smoke  from which ascended into an upper apartment.    In this system it was taught that the souls of the two extremes of  society, constituted of the righteous and the great sinners, would be  consigned immediately after the first judgment, the one to the Elysium,  and the other to the Phlegethon, where they were to remain until the  second or general judgment; while the souls of less venial sinners,  constituting the greater mass of mankind, before being permitted to  enter the Elysium would be compelled to suffer the expiatory  punishments of the Metempsychosis, or in the upper region, or \"smoky  row\" of the Tartarus. Such was the Egyptian purgatory, and its denizens  constituted \"the spirits in prison\" referred to in I. Peter iii. 19,  from which the astrologers claimed to have the power to release,  provided their surviving friends paid liberally for their propitiatory  offices; and, from this assumption, the clergy of the Catholic church  derived the idea of saying masses for the repose of the soul. These  doctrines were carried by Pythagoras from Egypt to Greece about 550  years before the beginning of our era; and passing from thence to Rome,  the Greek and Latin poets vied with each other in portraying Hades and  the joys and terrors of its two states.      The Second or General Judgment.    The Egyptian Astrologers, recognizing the soul as a material entity,  and conceiving the idea that in the future life it would require a  material organization for its perfect action, taught that at the  general judgment it would be re-united to its resurrected body. In  conformity to this belief, Job is made to say in chapter xix. 25, 26,  \"I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter  day upon the earth; and though worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh  shall I see God.\" The higher class Egyptians, however, fearing that  their existence would continue to be of the same shadowy and intangible  character after the second judgment, as they believed it would be in  the Amenti, if worms were allowed to destroy their bodies, hoped to  preserve them until that time by the process of embalming.    The imaginary events to occur in connection with the second judgment,  which, constituting the finale of the plan of redemption, and  inculcated in what are known as the doctrines of Second Adventism, were  to be inaugurated by an archangel sounding a trumpet summoning the  quick and the dead to appear before the bar of the gods to receive  their final awards. At the second judgment, designated in the  allegories as \"the last day,\" \"day of judgment,\" \"great and terrible  day of the Lord,\" etc., it was taught that the tenth and last saviour  would make his second advent by descending upon the clouds, and after  the final awards, the elect being caught up \"to meet the Lord in the  air\" (I. Thes. iv. 17), the heaven and the earth would be reduced to  chaos through the agency of fire. In reference to that grand  catastrophe we find it recorded in II. Peter iii. 10, that \"the heavens  shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with  fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be  burned up.\"    After the organization of a new heaven and a new earth it was taught  that upon the latter would descend a beautiful city, with pearly gates  and golden streets, called the City of God, the Kingdom of God, the  Kingdom of Heaven or New Jerusalem, in which the host of the redeemed  would, with their Lord and Saviour, enjoy the Millennium, or thousand  years of happiness unalloyed with evil; and such was the Kingdom for  the speedy coming of which the votaries of Astral worship were taught  to pray in what is known as the Lord's Prayer.    According to the teachings of the Allegories, there were to be no sun,  moon or stars during the Millennium, their authors having arranged it  so that the light of those luminaries would not be needed, as we find  recorded in Rev. xxi. 23, and xxii. 5: \"The city had no need of the  sun, neither of the moon to shine in it; for the glory of God did  lighten it,\" and \"there shall be no night there; and they need no  candle, neither the light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them  light.\" It must be remembered, when reading the fanciful ideas relative  to the City of God, that they were composed by men who, living in a  very ignorant age, gave free rein to fervid imaginations.        JEWISH OR ANCIENT CHRISTIANITY.    It is our purpose to present the evidences showing that a system of  Astral worship, which we designate as Jewish Christianity, was in  existence more than two centuries and a half before the institution of  its modern form. In verification of this assertion we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#8)"],[1,"competition for insect trade waged about them. Here, where the struggle  for survival is incomparably easier, we have terrestrial orchids, small,  and quietly clad, for the most part.      Calopogon; Grass Pink    _Calopogon pulchellus (Limodorum tuberosum)_    _Flowers_--Purplish pink, 1 in. long, 3 to 15 around a long, loose  spike. Sepals and petals similar, oval, acute; the lip on upper side of  flower is broad at the summit, tapering into a claw, flexible as if  hinged, densely bearded on its face with white, yellow, and magenta  hairs (_Calopogon_ = beautiful beard). Column below lip (ovary not  twisted in this exceptional case); sticky stigma at summit of column,  and just below it a 2-celled anther, each cell containing 2 pollen  masses, the grain lightly connected by threads. _Scape:_ 1 to 1-1/2 ft.  high, slender, naked. _Leaf:_ Solitary, long, grass-like, from a round  bulb arising from bulb of previous year.    _Preferred Habitat_--Swamps, cranberry bogs, and low meadows.    _Flowering Season_--June-July.    _Distribution_--Newfoundland to Florida, and westward to the  Mississippi.    Fortunately this lovely orchid, one of the most interesting of its  highly organized family, is far from rare, and where we find the Rose  Pogonia and other bog-loving relatives growing, the Calopogon usually  outnumbers them all. _Limodorum_ translated reads meadow-gift; but we  find the flower less frequently in grassy places than those who have  waded into its favorite haunts could wish.      Arethusa; Indian Pink    _Arethusa bulbosa_    _Flowers_--1 to 2 in. long, bright purple pink, solitary, violet  scented, rising from between a pair of small scales at end of smooth  scape from 5 to 10 in. high. Lip dropping beneath sepals and petals,  broad, rounded, toothed, or fringed, blotched with purple, and with  three hairy ridges down its surface. _Leaf:_ Solitary, hidden at first,  coming after the flower, but attaining length of 6 in. _Root:_ Bulbous.  _Fruit:_ A 6-ribbed capsule, 1 in. long, rarely maturing.    _Preferred Habitat_--Northern bogs and swamps.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--From North Carolina and Indiana northward to the Fur  Countries.    One flower to a plant, and that one rarely maturing seed; a temptingly  beautiful prize which few refrain from carrying home, to have it wither  on the way; pursued by that more persistent lover than Alpheus, the  orchid-hunter who exports the bulbs to European collectors--little  wonder this exquisite orchid is rare, and that from certain of those  cranberry bogs of eastern New England, which it formerly brightened with  its vivid pink, it has now gone forever. Like Arethusa, the nymph whom  Diana changed into a fountain that she might escape from the infatuated  river god, Linnaeus fancied this flower a maiden in the midst of a  spring bubbling from wet places where presumably none may follow her.      Nodding Ladies' Tresses or Traces    _Spiranthes cernua_    _Flowers_--Small, white or yellowish, without a spur, fragrant, nodding  or spreading in 3 rows on a cylindrical, slightly twisted spike 4 or 5  in. long. Side sepals free, the upper ones arching, and united with  petals; the oblong, spreading lip crinkle-edged, and bearing minute,  hairy callosities at base. _Stem:_ 6 in. to 2 ft. tall, with several  pointed, wrapping bracts. _Leaves:_ From or near the base, linear,  almost grass-like.    _Preferred Habitat_--Low meadows, ditches, and swamps.    _Flowering Season_--July-October.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, and westward to the  Mississippi.    This last orchid of the season, and perhaps the commonest of its  interesting tribe in the eastern United States, at least, bears flowers  that, however insignificant in size, are marvellous pieces of mechanism,  to which such men as Charles Darwin and Asa Gray have devoted hours of  study and, these two men particularly, much correspondence.    Just as a woodpecker begins at the bottom of a tree and taps his way  upward, so a bee begins at the lower and older flowers on a spike and  works up to the younger ones; a fact on which this little orchid, like  many another plant that arranges its blossoms in long racemes, depends.  Let us not note for the present what happens in the older flowers, but  begin our observations, with the help of a powerful lens, when the bee  has alighted on the spreading lip of a newly opened blossom toward the  top of the spire. As nectar is already secreted for her in its  receptacle, she thrusts her tongue through the channel provided to guide  it aright, and by the slight contact with the furrowed rostellum, it  splits, and releases a boat-shaped disk standing vertically on its stern  in the passage. Within the boat is an extremely sticky cement that  hardens almost instantly on exposure to the air. The splitting of the  rostellum, curiously enough, never happens without insect aid; but if a  bristle or needle be passed over it ever so lightly, a stream of sticky,  milky fluid exudes, hardens, and the boat-shaped disk, with pollen  masses attached, may be withdrawn on the bristle just as the bee removes  them with her tongue. Each pollinium consists of two leaves of pollen  united for about half their length in the middle with elastic threads.  As the pollinia are attached parallel to the disk, they stick parallel  on the bee's tongue, yet she may fold up her proboscis under her head,  if she choose, without inconvenience from the pollen masses, or without  danger of loosening them. Now, having finished sucking the newly-opened  flowers at the top of the spike, away she flies to an older flower at  the bottom of another one. Here a marvellous thing has happened. The  passage which, when the flower first expanded, scarcely permitted a  bristle to pass, has now widened through the automatic downward  movement of the column in order to expose the stigmatic surfaces to  contact with the pollen masses brought by the bee. Without the bee's  help this orchid, with a host of other flowers, must disappear from the  face of the earth. So very many species which have lost the power to  fertilize themselves now depend absolutely on these little pollen  carriers, it is safe to say that, should the bees perish, one half our  flora would be exterminated with them. On the slight downward movement  of the column in the ladies' tresses, then, as well as on the bee's  ministrations, the fertilization of the flower absolutely depends. \"If  the stigma of the lowest flower has already been fully fertilized,\" says  Darwin, \"little or no pollen will be left on its dried surface; but on  the next succeeding flower, of which the stigma is adhesive, large  sheets of pollen will be left. Then as soon as the bee arrives near the  summit of the spike she will withdraw fresh pollinia, will fly to the  lower flowers on another plant, and fertilize them; and thus, as she  goes her rounds and adds to her store of honey, she continually  fertilizes fresh flowers and perpetuates the race of autumnal  spiranthes, which will yield honey to future generations of bees.\"          BUCKWHEAT FAMILY _(Polygonaceae)_      Common Persicaria, Pink Knotweed, or Jointweed; Smartweed    _Polygonum pennsylvanicum_    _Flowers_--Very small, pink, collected in terminal, dense, narrow obtuse  spikes, 1 to 2 in. long. Calyx pink or greenish, 5-parted, like petals;  no corolla; stamens 8 _or_ less; style 2-parted. _Stem:_ 1 to 3 ft.  high, simple or branched; often partly red, the joints swollen and  sheathed; the branches above, and peduncles glandular. _Leaves:_ Oblong,  lance-shaped, entire edged, 2 to 11 in. long, with stout midrib, sharply  tapering at tip, rounded into short petioles below.    _Preferred Habitat_--Waste places, roadsides, moist soil.    _Flowering Season_--July-October.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico; westward to Texas and  Minnesota.    Everywhere we meet this commonest of plants or some of its similar kin,  the erect pink spikes brightening roadsides, rubbish heaps, fields, and  waste places, from midsummer to frost. The little flowers, which open  without method anywhere on the spike they choose, attract many insects,  the smaller bees (_Andrena_) conspicuous among the host. As the  spreading divisions of the perianth make nectar-stealing all too easy  for ants and other crawlers that would not come in contact with anthers  and stigma where they enter a flower near its base, most buckwheat  plants whose blossoms secrete sweets protect themselves from theft by  coating the upper stems with glandular hairs that effectually discourage  the pilferers. Shortly after fertilization, the little rounded,  flat-sided fruit begins to form inside the persistent pink calyx. At any  time the spike-like racemes contain more bright pink buds and shining  seeds than flowers. Familiarity alone breeds contempt for this plant,  that certainly possesses much beauty. The troublesome and wide-ranging  weed called lady's thumb is a near relative.          POKEWEED FAMILY _(Phytolaccaceae)_      Pokeweed; Scoke; Pigeon-berry; Ink-berry; Garget    _Phytolacca decandra_    _Flowers_--White, with a green centre, pink tinted outside, about 1/4  in. across, in bracted racemes 2 to 8 in. long. Calyx of 4 or 5 rounded  persistent sepals, simulating petals; no corolla; 10 short stamens;  10-celled ovary, green, conspicuous; styles curved. _Stem:_ Stout,  pithy, erect, branching, reddening toward the end of summer, 4 to 10 ft.  tall, from a large, perennial, poisonous root. _Leaves:_ Alternate,  petioled, oblong to lance-shaped, tapering at both ends, 8 to 12 in.  long. _Fruit:_ Very juicy, dark purplish berries, hanging in long  clusters from reddened footstalks; ripe, August-October.    _Preferred Habitat_--Roadsides, thickets, field borders, and waste soil,  especially in burnt-over districts.    _Flowering Season_--June-October    _Distribution_--Maine and Ontario to"]]]
