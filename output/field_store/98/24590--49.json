Old World towns they seem to be. The houses are built of sun-baked mud  bricks, kneaded by mares that splash and trample through the oozy  substance for hours to mix it well. The poorer people build ranches of  long, slender canes or Indian cornstalks tied together by grass and  coated with mud. These are all erected around and about the most  imposing edifice in the place--the whitewashed adobe church.    All houses are hollow squares. The _patio_, with its well, is inside  this enclosure. Each house is lime-washed in various colors, and all  are flat-roofed and provided with grated windows, giving them a  prison-like appearance. The window-panes are sometimes made of mica.  Over the front doors of some of the better houses are pictures of the  Virgin. The nurse's house is designated by having over the doorway a  signboard, on which is painted a full-blooming rose, out of the petals  of which is peeping a little babe.    If you wish to enter a house, you do not knock at the door (an act that  would be considered great rudeness), but clap your hands, and you are  most courteously invited to enter. The good woman at once sets to work  to serve you with _mate_, and quickly rolls a cigar, which she hands to  you from her mouth, where she has already lighted it by a live ember of  charcoal taken from the fire with a spoon. Matches can be bought, but  they cost about ten cents a hundred. If you tell the housewife you do  not smoke she will stare at you in gaping wonder. Their children use  the weed, and I have seen a mother urge her three-year-old boy to whiff  at a cigarette.    Bound each dwelling is a _ramada_, where grapes in their season hang in  luxuriant clusters; and each has its own garden, where palms, peaches,  figs, oranges, limes, sweet potatoes, tobacco, nuts, garlic, etc., grow  luxuriantly. The garden is surrounded by a hedge of cacti or other  kindred plants. The prickly pear tree of that family is one of the  strangest I have seen. On the leaves, which are an inch or more in  thickness, grows the fruit, and I have counted as many as thirteen  pears growing on a single leaf. When ripe they are a deep red color,  and very sweet to the taste. The skin is thick, and covered with  innumerable minute prickles. It is, I believe, a most refreshing and  healthful food.    Meat is very cheap. A fine leg of mutton may be bought for the  equivalent of twelve cents, and good beef at four cents a pound. Their  favorite wine, _Lagrimas de San Juan_ (Tears of Holy John), can be  bought for ten cents a quart.    All cooking is done on braziers--a species of three-legged iron bucket  in which the charcoal fire is kindled. On this the little kettle,  filled from the well in the _patio_, is boiled for the inevitable  _mate_. About this herb I picked up, from various sources, some  interesting information. The _mate_ plant grows chiefly In Paraguay,  and is sent down the river in bags made of hides. From the village of  Tacurti Pucu in that country comes a strange account of the origin of  the _yerba mate_ plant, which runs thus: \"God, accompanied by St. John  and St. Peter, came down to the earth and commenced to journey. One  day, after most difficult travel, they arrived at the house of an old  man, father to a virgin young and beautiful. The old man cared so much  for this girl, and was so anxious to keep her ever pure and innocent,  that they had gone to live in the depths of a forest. The man was very,  very poor, but willingly gave his heavenly visitors the best he could,  killing in their honor the only hen he possessed, which served for  supper. Noting this action, God asked St. Peter and St. John, when they  were alone, what they would do if they were Him. They both answered Him  that they would largely reward such an unselfish host. Bringing him to  their presence, God addressed him in these words: 'Thou who art poor  hast been generous, and I will reward thee for it. Thou hast a daughter  who is pure and innocent, and whom thou greatly lovest. I will make her  immortal, and she shall never disappear from earth.' Then God  transformed her into the plant of the yerba mate. Since then the herb  exists, and although it is cut down it springs up again.\" Other stories  run that the maiden still lives; for God, instead of turning her into  the mate plant, made her mistress of it, and she lives to help all  those who make a compact with her, Many men during \"Holy week,\" if near  a town, visit the churches of Paraguay and formally promise to dedicate  themselves to her worship, to live in the woods and have no other  woman. After this vow they go to the forest, taking a paper on which  the priest has written their name. This they pin with a thorn on the  mate plant, and leave it for her to read. Thus she secures her devotees.    Roman Catholicism is not \"_Semper Idem_,\" but adapts itself to its  surroundings.    Mate is drunk by all, from the babe to the centenarian; by the rich  cattle-owner, who drinks it from a chased silver cup through a golden  _bombilla_, to his servant, who is content with a small gourd, which  everywhere grows wild, and a tin tube. Tea, as we know it, is only to  be bought at the chemist's as a remedy for _nerves_. In other countries  it is said to be bad for nerves.    Each house possesses its private altar, where the saints are kept. That  sacred spot is veiled off when possible--if only by hanging in front of  it a cow's hide--from the rest of the dwelling. It consists, according  to the wealth or piety of the housewife, in expensive crosses, beads,  and pictures of saints decked out with costly care; or, it may be, but  one soiled lithograph surrounded by paper flowers or cheap baubles of  the poorer classes; but all are alike sacred. Everything of value or  beauty is collected and put as an offering to these deities--pieces of  colored paper, birds' eggs, a rosy tomato or pomegranate, or any  colored picture or bright tin. Descending from the ridiculous to the  gruesome, I have known a mother scrape and clean the bones of her dead  daughter in order that _they_ might be given a place on the altar.  Round this venerated spot the goodwife, with her palm-leaf broom,  sweeps with assiduous care, and afterwards carefully dusts her crucifix  and other devotional objects with her brush of ostrich feathers. Here  she kneels in prayer to the different saints. God Himself is never  invoked. Saint Anthony interests himself in finding her lost ring, and  Saint Roque is a wonderful physician in case of sickness. If she be a  maiden Saint Carmen will find her a suitable husband; if a widow, Saint  John will be a husband to her; and if an orphan, the sacred heart of  the Virgin of Carmen gives balsam to the forlorn one. Saint Joseph  protects the artisan, and if a candle is burnt in front of Saint Ramon,  he will most obligingly turn away the tempest or the lightning stroke.  In all cases one candle at least must be promised these mysterious  benefactors, and rash indeed would be the man or woman who failed to  burn the candle; some most terrible vengeance would surely overtake him  or his family.    God, as I have said, is never invoked. Perhaps He is supposed to sit in  solitary grandeur while the saints administer His affairs? These latter  are innumerable, and whatever may be their position in the minds of  Romanists in other lands, in South America they are distinct and  separate gods, and their graven image, picture or carving is worshipped  as such.    When religious questions have not arisen, life in those remote villages  has passed very pleasantly. The people live in great simplicity,  knowing scarcely anything of the outside world and its progress.    At the Feast of St. John the women take sheep and lambs, gaily  decorated with colored ribbons, to church with them. That is an act of  worship, for the priest puts his hand on each lamb and blesses it. A  _velorio_ for the dead, or a dance at a child's death, are generally  the only meetings beside the church; but, as the poet says:        \"'Tis known, at least it should be, that throughout       All countries of the Catholic persuasion,      Some weeks before Shrove Tuiesiday comes about,       The people take their fill of recreation,      And buy repentance ere they grow devout,       However high their rank or low their station,      With fiddlling, feasting, dancing, drinking, masking,      And other things which may be had for asking.\"    Carnival is a joyous time, and if for only once in the year the quiet  town then resounds with mirth. Pails of water are carried up to the  flat roofs of the houses, and each unwary pedestrian is in turn  deluged. At other times flour is substituted, and on the last day of  the feast ashes are thrown on all sides. At other seasons of the year  the streets are quiet, and after the rural pursuits of the day are  over, the guitar is brought out, and the evening breeze wafts waves of  music to each listening ear. The guitar is in all South America what  the bag-pipes are to Scotland-the national musical instrument of the  people. The Criollo plays mostly plaintive, broken airs--now so low as  to be almost inaudible, then high and shrill. Here and there he  accompanies the music with snatches of song, telling of an exploit or  describing the dark eyes of some lovely maiden. The airs strike one as  being very strange, and decidedly unlike the rolling songs of British  music.    In those interior towns a very quiet life may be passed, far away from  the whistle of the railway engine. Everything is simplicity itself, and  it might almost be said of some that _time itself seems at a  standstill_. During the heat of the day the streets are entirely  deserted; shops are closed, and all the world is asleep, for that is  the _siesta_ time. \"They eat their dinners and go to sleep--and could  they do better?\"    After this the barber draws his chair out to the causeway and shaves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7506"],[0,"The Huge Hunter; Or, The Steam Man of the Prairies (#8)"],[1,"to St. Louis.'    'Thunderation! I didn't mean that. Go ahead.'    'Such a lamp or head-light as the locomotives use would cost several  hundred dollars, although I could have made one nearly as good for  much less. Such a thing in the center of a man's forehead, and the  whistle at the end of his nose, would give him quite an impressive  appearance.'    'Yer must do it, too, some day My God!'    The boy instantly checked their progress, as the trapper uttered his  exclamation; but quickly as it was done, it was none too soon, for  another long step and the steam man would have gone down an  embankment, twenty feet high, into a roaring river at the base. As it  was, both made rather a hurried leap to the ground, and ran to the  front to see whether there was not danger of his going down.    But fortunately he stood firm.    'I declare that was a narrow escape!' exclaimed the boy as he gazed  down the cavernous darkness, looking doubly frightful in the gloom of  the night.    'Skulp me if that wouldn't have been almost as bad as staying among  the red-skins,' replied the trapper. 'How are we goin' to get him out  of this?'    'We've got to shove him back ourselves.'    'Can't we reverse him?'    'No; he isn't gotten up on that principle.'    By great labor they managed to make him retrograde a few steps, so  that he could be made to shy enough to leave the dangerous vicinity,  and once more started upon the broad firm prairie.    'Do you suppose these Indians are following us?' inquired the boy.    'No fear of it.'    'Then we may as well stay here.'    The fires were drawn again, everything made right, and the two  disposed themselves again for spending the night in slumber.    No disturbance occurred, and both slept Roundly until broad daylight.  The trapper's first proceeding upon awakening was to scan the prairie  in every direction in quest of danger.    He was not a little amused to see a dozen or so mounted Indians about  a third of a mile to the west. They had reined up on the plain, and  were evidently scanning the strange object, with a great deal of  wonder, mixed with some fear.    'Do you think they will attack us?' inquired the boy, who could not  suppress his trepidation at the sight of the warlike savages, on their  gayly-caparisoned horses, drawn up in such startling array.    'Ef thar war any danger of that, we could stop 'em by 'tacking 'em.    'Jest fire up and start toward 'em, and see how quick they will  scatter.' The advice was acted upon on the instant, although it was  with no little misgiving on the part of the engineer.    All the time that the 'firingup' process was under way the savages sat  as motionless as statues upon their horses. Had they understood the  real nature of the 'animal,' it cannot be supposed that they would  rave hesitated for a moment to charge down upon it and demolish it  entirely.    But it was a terra incognita, clothed with a terror such as no array  of: enemies could wear, and they preferred to keep at a goodly  distance from it.    'Now, suppose they do not run?' remarked Johnny, rather doubtingly, as  he hesitated whether to start ahead or not.    'What if they don't? Can't we run another way? But yer needn't fear.  Jist try it on.'    Steam was let on as rapidly as possible, and the momentum gathering  quickly, it was soon speeding over the prairie at a tremendous rate,  straight toward the savages.    The latter remained motionless a few moments, before they realized  that it was coining after them, and then, wheeling about, they ran as  though all the legions of darkness were after them.    'Shall I keep it up?' shouted Johnny in the ear of the hunter.    'Yas; give 'em such a skear that they won't be able to git over it  ag'in in all thar lives.'    There is some fun in chasing a foe, when you know that he is really  afraid of you, and will keep running without any thought of turning at  bay, and the dwarf put the steam man to the very highest notch of  speed that was safe, even at the slight risk of throwing both the  occupants out.    The prairie was harder and nearer level than any over which they had  passed since starting, so that nothing was in the way of preventing  the richest kind of sport.    'Are we gaining?' inquired Johnny, his eyes glowing with excitement.    'Gaining? Thar never was a red-skin that had such a chase in all the  world. Ef they don't git out the way mighty soon, we'll run over 'em  all.'    They were, in truth, rapidly overhauling the red-skins, who were about  as much terrified as it was possible for a mortal to be, and still  live.    To increase their fears, the boy kept up a constant shrieking of his  whistle. If there had been any other contrivance or means at his  command, it is possible the red-skins would have tumbled off their  horses and died; for they were bearing almost all the fright, terror  and horror that can possibly be concentrated into a single person.    Finding there was no escape by means of the speed of their horses, the  Indians sensibly did what the trapper had prophesied they would do at  first.    They 'scattered,' all diverging over the prairie. As it was impossible  for the steam man to overtake all of these, of course, this expedient  secured the safety of the majority.    Neither Baldy nor the boy were disposed to give up the sport in this  manner; so, they singled out a single 'noble red-man,' who was  pursuing nearly the same direction as they were, and they headed  straight for him.    The poor wretch, when he saw that he was the object of the monster's  pursuit, seemed to become frantic with terror. Rising on his horse's  back, he leaned forward until it looked as though there was danger of  going over his head altogether. Then, whooping and shrieking to his  terrified horse, that was already straining every nerve, he pounded  his heels in its sides, vainly urging it to still greater speed.    In the mean time, the steam man was gaining steadily upon him, while  to add variety to the scene, Johnny kept up the unearthly shrieking of  the nose-whistle of the giant. It was difficult to tell which sounded  the most hideously in this strange chase.    The remaining Indians had improved their advantage to the utmost.  Fearful that their dreadful enemy might change its mind and single  them out, they kept up their tearing light, all regardless of the  great extremity to which their companion was reduced, until finally  they disappeared in the distance.    A short distance only separated pursuer and pursued, when the latter,  realizing that there was no escape in flight, headed toward the river,  which was a short distance on the right.    This saved him. When with a bowl, horse and rider thundered over the  bank and disappeared, the steam man could not follow him. He was  compelled to give up the chase and draw off. A few days later, and  without further noteworthy incident, the steam man reached Wolf  Ravine, being received in the manner narrated at the beginning of this  story.                               CHAPTER X. WOLF RAVINE.    DURING THE absence of Baldy Bicknell in search of the steam man,  neither Mickey nor Ethan had been disturbed by Indians.    They had worked unceasingly in digging the gold mine to which they had  gained access through the instrumentality of the trapper. When they  had gathered together quite a quantity of the gravel and dirt, with  the yellow sand glittering through it, it was carried a short distance  to the margin of the river, where it underwent the 'washing' process.    While thus engaged, one of them was constantly running up the bank, to  make sure that their old enemies did not steal upon them unawares.  Once or twice they caught sight of several moving in the distance, but  they did not come near enough to molest them, doing nothing more than  to keep them on the qui vive.    There was one Indian, however, who bestrode a black horse, who haunted  them like a phantom. When they glanced over the river, at almost any  time, they could see this individual cautiously circling about on his  horse, and apparently waiting for a chance to get a shot at his  enemies.    'Begorrah, but he loves us, that he does, as the lamb observed when  speaking of the wolf,' said Mickey, just after he had sent a bullet  whistling about their ears.    'Jehosiphat! he loves us too much!' added the Yankee, who had no  relish for these stolen shots. 'If we ain't keerful, there'll be  nuthin' of us left when Baldy comes back, that is, if he comes back at  all.'    This red-skin on his black horse was so dangerous that he required  constant watching, and the men could perform only half their usual  work. It was while Mickey was on the lookout for him that he caught  sight of the steam man coming toward him, as we have related in  another place.    So long as that personage was kept puffing and tearing round the  vicinity, they knew there was no fear of disturbance from the  treacherous red-skins, who were so constantly on the alert to avenge  themselves for the loss they had suffered in the attack; but it would  hardly pay to keep an iron man as sentinel, as the wear and tear in  all probability would be too much for him.    After consulting together upon the return of Baldy, and after they had  ridden behind the steam man to their heart's content, they decided  upon their future course. As the boy, Johnny, had no intention of  devoting himself to manual labor, even had he been able, it was agreed  that he should take upon himself the part of sentinel, while the  others were at work.    In this way it was believed that they could finish within a couple of  weeks, bidding good-by to the Indians, and quickly reach the States  and give up their dangerous pursuits altogether, whereas, if compelled  to do duty themselves as sentinels, their stay would be doubly  prolonged.    This arrangement suited the boy very well, who was thereby given  opportunity to exercise his steam man by"]]]
