He was to ride in Jack Hopkins'  goat wagon.    \"Fall in!\" called Harry, and at the word all the companies fell in line.    \"Cadets first,\" ordered the captain.    Then Flossie walked the very first one. After her came Nan and her  company. (No one noticed that Nettie's eyes were a little red from  crying. She had been so disappointed at first when she thought she  couldn't go in the parade.) After the girls came Freddie as Uncle Sam,  in the goat wagon led by Bert (for fear the goat might run away), then  fifteen boys, all with drums or fifes or some other things with which  to make a noise. Roy was in the second division with his wagon, and  last of all came the funniest thing.    A boy dressed up like a bear with a big sign on him:    TEDDY!    He had a gun under his arm and looked too comical for anything.    It was quite warm to wear a big fur robe and false face, but under this  was Jack Hopkins, the bear Teddy, and he didn't mind being warm when he  made everybody laugh so.    \"Right foot, left foot, right foot, forward march!\" called Nan, and the  procession started up the path straight for the Bobbsey house.    \"Goodness gracious, sakes alive! Do come see de childrens! Ha, ha! Dat  sure am a parade!\" called Dinah, running through the house to the front  door to view the procession.    \"Oh, isn't it just beautiful!\" Martha echoed close at Dinah's heels.    \"My!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey; \"how did they ever get made up so pretty!\"    \"And look at Flossie!\" exclaimed Aunt Sarah.    \"And see Freddie!\" put in Uncle Daniel.    \"Oh, we must get the camera!\" Mr. Bobbsey declared, while the whole  household, all excited, stood out on the porch when the parade advanced.    Such drumming and such tooting of fifes and horns!    Freddie's chariot was now in line with the front stoop, and he raised  his tall hat to the ladies like a real Uncle Sam.    \"Oh, the bear! the bear!\" called everybody, as they saw \"Teddy\" coming  up.    \"That's great,\" continued Uncle Daniel.    By this time Mr. Bobbsey had returned with the camera.    \"Halt!\" called Harry, and the procession stood still.    \"Look this way. There now, all ready,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, and snap went  the camera on as pretty a picture as ever covered a plate.    \"Right wheel! forward march!\" called Nan again, and amid drumming and  tooting the procession started off to parade through the center of  Meadow Brook.        CHAPTER X    A GREAT DAY    Never before had such a parade been seen in the little country place,  and all along the road cheer after cheer greeted our young friends, for  even the few old soldiers who lived in Meadow Brook enjoyed the  children's Fourth of July fun.    By lunch time the procession had covered all the ground planned, so  from the postoffice the cadets and regulars started back over the shady  country road.    And at home they found a surprise awaiting them!    Ice cream on the lawn for everybody in the parade.    Aunt Sarah and Uncle Daniel had set out all the garden benches, and  with the two kinds of ice cream made by Dinah and Martha, besides the  cookies and jumbles Aunt Sarah supplied, with ice-cold lemonade that  John passed around, surely the tired little soldiers and cadets had  splendid refreshment!    \"My goat almost runned away!\" lisped Freddie. \"But I held on tight like  a real fireman.\"    \"And mine wanted to stop and eat grass in the middle of the big  parade,\" Roy told them.    \"Now eat up your ice cream. Nettie, have some more? Jack, you surely  need two plates after carrying that bear skin,\" said Uncle Daniel.    The youngsters did not have to be urged to eat some more of the good  things, and so it took quite a while to \"finish up the rations,\" as  Uncle Daniel said.    \"They're goin' to shoot the old cannon off, father,\" Harry told Uncle  Daniel, \"and we're all going over on the pond bank to see them, at  three o'clock.\"    \"They're foolish to put powder in that old cracked gun,\" remarked Uncle  Daniel. \"Take care, if you go over, that you all keep at a safe  distance.\"    It was not long until three o'clock, and then when all the  red-white-and-blue things had been stored away for another year, the  boys hurried off to see Peter Burns fire the old cannon.    Quite a crowd of people had gathered about the pond bank, which was a  high green wall like that which surrounds a reservoir.    Peter was busy stuffing the powder in the old gun, and all the others  looked on anxiously.    \"Let's go up in that big limb of the willow tree,\" suggested Bert. \"We  can see it all then, and be out of range of the fire.\"    So the boys climbed up in the low willow, that leaned over the pond  bank.    \"They're almost ready,\" Harry said, seeing the crowd scatter.    \"Look out!\" yelled Peter, getting hold of the long string that would  fire the gun.    Peter gave it a tug, then another.    Everybody held their breath, expecting to hear an awful bang, but the  gun didn't go off.    Very cautiously Peter stepped nearer the cannon to see what might be  the matter, when the next instant with a terrific report the whole  cannon flew up in the air!    Peter fell back! His hat seemed to go up with the gun!    \"Oh, he's killed!\" yelled the people.    \"Poor Peter!\" gasped Harry.    \"He ought to know better!\" said Mr. Mason.    \"Father said that cannon was dangerous,\" Harry added.    By this time the crowd had surrounded Peter, who lay so still and  looked so white. The Bobbsey boys climbed down from the tree and joined  the others.  \"He's only unconscious from the shock,\" spoke up Mr.  Mason, who was leaning down very close to Peter. \"Stand back, and give  him air.\"    The crowd fell back now, and some of the boys looked around to find the  pieces of cannon.    \"Don't touch it,\" said Tom Mason, as a little fellow attempted to pick  up a piece of the old gun. \"There might be powder in it half lighted.\"    Mrs. Burns had run over from her home at the report of the accident,  and she was now bathing Peter's face with water from the pond.    \"He's subject to fainting spells,\" she told the frightened people, \"and  I think he'll be all right when he comes to.\"    Peter looked around, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes.    \"Did it go off?\" he smiled, remembering the big report.    \"Guess it did, and you went off with it,\" Mr. Mason said. \"How do you  feel?\"    \"Oh, I'll be all right when my head clears a bit. I guess I fainted.\"    \"So you did,\" said Mrs. Burns, \"and there's no use scolding you for  firing that old gun. Come home now and go to bed; you have had all the  fireworks you want for one day.\"    Quite a crowd followed Peter over to his home, for they could not  believe he was not in any way hurt.    \"Let us go home,\" Harry said to his cousin. \"We have to get all our  fireworks ready before evening.\"    The boys found all at home enjoying themselves. Freddie's torpedoes  still held out, and Flossie had a few more \"snakes\" left. Nan had  company on the lawn, and it indeed was an ideal Fourth of July.    \"Look at the balloon!\" called John from the carriage house. \"It's going  to land in the orchard.\" This announcement caused all the children to  hurry up to the orchard, for everybody likes to \"catch\" a balloon.    \"There's a man in it,\" John exclaimed as the big ball tossed around in  the air.    \"Yes, that's the balloon that went up from the farmers' picnic,\" said  Harry.    The next minute a parachute shot out from the balloon; and hanging to  it the form of a man could be seen.    \"Oh, he'll fall!\" cried Freddie, all excited. \"Let's catch him--in  something!\"    \"He's all right,\" John assured the little boy. \"That umbrella keeps him  from coming down too quickly.\"    \"How does it?\" Freddie asked.    \"Why, you see, sonny, the air gets under the umbrella and holds it up.  The man's weight then brings it down gently.\"    \"Oh, maybe he will let us fly up in it,\" Freddie remarked, much  interested.    \"Here he comes! here he comes!\" the boys called, and sure enough the  big parachute, with the man dangling on it, was now coming right  down--down--in the harvest-apple tree!    \"Hello there!\" called the man from above, losing the colored umbrella  and quickly dropping himself from the low tree.    \"Hello yourself!\" answered John. \"Did you have a nice ride?\"    \"First class,\" replied the man with the stars on his shirt. \"But I've  got a long walk back to the grove. Could I hire a bicycle around here?\"    Harry spoke to his father, and then quickly decided to let the balloon  man ride his bicycle down to the picnic grounds.    \"You can leave it at the ice-cream stand,\" Harry told the stranger. \"I  know the man there, and he will take care of it for me until I call for  it.\"    The children were delighted to talk to a real live man that had been up  in a balloon, and the balloonist was indeed very pleasant with the  little ones. He took Freddie up in his arms and told him all about how  it felt to be up in the sky.    \"You're a truly fireman!\" Freddie said, after listening to all the  dangers there are so far above ground. \"I'm a real fireman too!\"    Just then the balloon that had been tossing about in the air came down  in the other end of the orchard.    \"Well, there!\" exclaimed the man. \"That's good luck. Now, whichever one  of you boys gets that balloon first will get ten dollars. That's what  we pay for bringing it back!\"    With a dash every boy started for the spot where the balloon had  landed. There were quite a few others besides the Bobbseys, and they  tumbled over each other trying to get there first. Ned Prentice,  Nettie's brother, was one of the best runners, and he cut across the  orchard to get a clear way out of the crowd.    \"Go it, Bert!\" called John.    \"Keep it up, Harry!\" yelled someone else.    \"You'd get it, Tom!\" came another voice.    But Ned was not in the regular race, and nobody noticed him.    \"They've got it,\" called the excited girls.    \"It's Harry!\"    \"No, it's Bert!\"    \"'Tisn't either--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#8)"],[1," vote in the House of Representatives on this Tariff  Bill discloses the fact that of the 39 votes for it, 21 were from  Southern States, 13 from the Middle States, and 5 from New England  States; while of the 13 votes against it, 9 were from New England  States, 3 from Southern States, and 1 from Middle States.  In other  words, while the Southern States were for the Bill in the proportion of  21 to 3, and the Middle States by 13 to 1, New England was against it by  9 to 5; or again, while 10 of the 13 votes against it were from the New  England and Middle States, 21 (or more than half) of the 39 votes for it  were from Southern States.    It will thus be seen-singularly enough in view of subsequent events  --that we not only mainly owe our first steps in Protective Tariff  legislation to the almost solid Southern vote, but that it was thus  secured for us despite the opposition of New England.  Nor did our  indebtedness to Southern statesmen and Southern votes for the  institution of the now fully established American System of Protection  cease here, as we shall presently see.    That Jefferson, as well as Washington and Madison, agreed with the views  of Alexander Hamilton on Protection to our domestic manufactures as  against those of foreign Nations, is evident in his Annual Message of  December 14, 1806, wherein-discussing an anticipated surplus of Federal  revenue above the expenditures, and enumerating the purposes of  education and internal improvement to which he thinks the \"whole surplus  of impost\" should during times of peace be applied; by which application  of such surplus he prognosticates that \"new channels of communication  will be opened between the States; the lines of separation will  disappear; their interests will be identified, and their Union cemented  by new and indissoluble ties\"--he says: \"Shall we suppress the impost  and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures.  On a few  articles of more general and necessary use, the suppression in due  season, will doubtless be right; but the great mass of the articles on  which impost is paid is foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who  are rich enough to afford themselves the use of them.\"  But his embargo  and other retaliatory measures, put in force in 1807 and 1808, and the  War of 1812-15 with Great Britain, which closely followed, furnished  Protection in another manner, by shutting the door to foreign imports  and throwing our people upon their own resources, and contributed  greatly to the encouragement and increase of our home manufactures  --especially those of wool, cotton, and hemp.    At the close of that War the traders of Great Britain determined, even  at a temporary loss to themselves, to glut our market with their goods  and thus break down forever, as they hoped, our infant manufactures.  Their purpose and object were boldly announced in the House of Commons  by Mr. Brougham, when he said: \"Is it worth while to incur a loss upon  the first importation, in order by the glut to stifle in the cradle  those rising manufactures in the United States which the War had forced  into existence contrary to the natural course of things.\"  Against this  threatened ruin, our manufacturers all over the United States--the sugar  planters of Louisiana among them--clamored for Protection, and Congress  at once responded with the Tariff Act of 1816.    This law greatly extended and increased specific duties on, and  diminished the application of the ad valorem principle to, foreign  imports; and it has been well described as \"the practical foundation of  the American policy of encouragement of home manufactures--the practical  establishment of the great industrial system upon which rests our  present National wealth, and the power and the prosperity and happiness  of our whole people.\"  While Henry Clay of Kentucky, William Loundes of  South Carolina, and Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia supported the  Bill most effectively, no man labored harder and did more effective  service in securing its passage than John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.  The contention on their part was not for a mere \"incidental protection\"  --much less a \"Tariff for revenue only\"--but for \"Protection\" in its  broadest sense, and especially the protection of their cotton  manufactures.  Indeed Calhoun's defense of Protection, from the assaults  of those from New England and elsewhere who assailed it on the narrow  ground that it was inimical to commerce and navigation, was a notable  one.  He declared that:    \"It (the encouragement of manufactures) produced a system strictly  American, as much so as agriculture, in which it had the decided  advantage of commerce and navigation.  The country will from this derive  much advantage.  Again it is calculated to bind together more closely  our wide-spread Republic.  It will greatly increase our mutual  dependence and intercourse, and will, as a necessary consequence, excite  an increased attention to internal improvements--a subject every way so  intimately connected with the ultimate attainment of national strength  and the perfection of our political institutions.\"    He regarded the fact that it would make the parts adhere more closely;  that it would form a new and most powerful cement far outweighing any  political objections that might be urged against the system.  In his  opinion \"the liberty and the union of the country were inseparably  united; that as the destruction of the latter would most certainly  involve the former, so its maintenance will with equal certainty  preserve it;\" and he closed with an impressive warning to the Nation of  a \"new and terrible danger\" which threatened it, to wit: \"disunion.\"  Nobly as he stood up then--during the last term of his service in the  House of Representatives--for the great principles of, the American  System of Protection to manufactures, for the perpetuity of the Union,  and for the increase of \"National strength,\" it seems like the very  irony of fate that a few years later should find him battling against  Protection as \"unconstitutional,\" upholding Nullification as a \"reserved  right\" of his State, and championing at the risk of his neck that very  \"danger\" to the \"liberties\" and life of his Country against which his  prophetic words had already given solemn warning.    Strange was it also, in view of the subsequent attitudes of the South  and New England, that this essentially Protective Tariff Act of 1816  should have been vigorously protested and voted against by New England,  while it was ably advocated and voted for by the South--the 25 votes of  the latter which secured its passage being more than sufficient to have  secured its defeat had they been so inclined.    The Tariff Acts of 1824 and 1828 followed the great American principle  of Protection laid down and supported by the South in the Act of 1816,  while widening, increasing, and strengthening it.  Under their  operation-especially under that of 1828, with its high duties on wool,  hemp, iron, lead, and other staples--great prosperity smiled upon the  land, and particularly upon the Free States.    In the cotton-growing belt of the South, however, where the prosperity  was relatively less, owing to the blight of Slavery, the very contrast  bred discontent; and, instead of attributing it to the real cause, the  advocates of Free Trade within that region insisted that the Protective  Tariff was responsible for the condition of things existing there.    A few restless and discontented spirits in the South had indeed agitated  the subject of Free Trade as against Protected manufactures as early as  1797, and, hand in hand with it, the doctrine of States Rights.  And  Jefferson himself, although, as we have already seen, attached to the  American System of Protection and believing in its Constitutionality,  unwittingly played into the hands of these Free Traders by drawing up  the famous Kentucky Resolutions of '98 touching States Rights, which  were closely followed by the Virginia Resolutions of 1799 in the same  vein by Madison, also an out-and-out Protectionist.  It was mainly in  condemnation of the Alien and Sedition Laws, then so unpopular  everywhere, that these resolutions were professedly fulminated, but they  gave to the agitating Free Traders a States-Rights-Secession-weapon of  which they quickly availed themselves.    Their drift may be gathered from the first of the Kentucky Resolutions  of '98, which was in these words: \"Resolved, That the several States  composing the United States of America are not united on the principle  of unlimited submission to their General Government, but that, by a  compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United  States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a General Government  for special purposes--delegated to that Government certain definite  powers, reserving, each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to  their own self-government; and that whensoever the General Government  assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of  no force; that to this compact each State acceded as a State, and as an  integral party, its co-States forming, as to itself, the other party;  that the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive  or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since  that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the  measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among  powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge  for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of  redress.\"    The Resolutions, after enumerating the Alien and Sedition and certain  other laws as in point, conclude by calling upon the other States to  join Kentucky in her opposition to such Federal usurpations of power as  thus embodied, and express confidence: \"That they will concur with this"]]]
