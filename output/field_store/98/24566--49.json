Fifty-six thousand and seventy years shall pass before the  Bodhisattva that is Maitreya shall attain unto the Perfected  Wisdom. But whoso embraceth the true faith shall at this very time  be lord of the great Enlightenment.    260. He that hath ascended unto the height of the Lesser  Enlightenment, accepting the Divine Promise of the Holy Name, shall  enter into the Great Nirvana, being made equal unto the Bodhisattva  Maitreya.    261. He that receiveth the true Faith, and is one with them that  return no more to birth and death, shall receive the Perfected  Wisdom, even as that Bodhisattva Maitreya that is called, \"He that  shall come.\"    262. And the wise in the age which is called Representative, having  utterly renounced all the doctrine of self-dependence, have entered  in at the gate of the Holy Name. For this is the way chosen for that  Age.    263. He who reciteth the Holy Name, having attained unto the true  faith, shall unceasingly adore the Eternal Father, that he may make  a return unto Him for His Grace.    264. Inexplicable and unutterable merit shall be given unto him who,  living in this sinful world, believeth the Divine Promise that  proceedeth from His will.    265. For the true welfare of men that shall be the Buddha of the  Great Light hath given the holy name of Wisdom unto the Bodhisattva  of Wisdom.    266. And with great compassion for mankind in this evil world the  Bodhisattva of Wisdom persuadeth them to believe upon the Holy Name,  and sweetly welcometh the believer that he may lead him into the  Land of Purity.    267. By the mercy of our Lord and of the Blessed One we are able to  attain unto the heart that desireth Buddhahood. At that time alone,  when we enter into the wisdom of the faith, shall we be ourselves  like unto them that would return good unto the Buddha for His Grace.    268. It is by the strength of the Divine Promise that we can reach  unto the holy name of Wisdom. Without the wisdom of the faith, how  is it possible that we should attain unto the Nirvana?    269. The Divine Light shineth over the Deep Night of ignorance,  therefore sorrow not that the wisdom of your eyes is darkened. The  holy Ark is at hand that voyageth over the great ocean of birth and  death; therefore fear not because your sin is heavy.    270. Great as is the night of the Divine Promise of our Salvation,  so light is the heaviest of our sins. Immeasurable is the wisdom of  our Father, and therefore they that are strong, as also they that  weary, shall never be forgotten.    271. Our Father hath perfected His mercy by uttering the Divine  Promise that giveth all His merit unto man, that He might save them  that are fast bound unto birth and death.    272. Yea, the recitation of His Holy Name is given of the Blessed  One. Therefore we must not offer this unto Him for the acquirement  of merit. For this will He most surely disdain.    273. Yea, verily, when the water of the mind of man floweth into the  great Ocean of the Divine Promise of the Perfect Wisdom it is  changed and becometh the mind of infinite compassion.    274. And the Lord saith, speaking through a certain Sutra:    \"My disciples that shall be, they that are sinners because of the  lost way and love of evil things, it is they that shall destroy my  holy doctrine.\"    275. Whoso blasphemeth the doctrine of the Holy Name shall suffer  without ceasing, for he shall fall into the depth of the Hell of  Avichi for eighty thousands of Kalpas.    276. He to whom is given the true entrance into the True and  Promised Land, by the grace of our Lord and of the Blessed One,  shall be one with those men who return no more unto birth and death,  and after this transitory life attain unto the Great Peace.    277. Well may we understand from the teaching of the myriad Buddhas  in the Ten Regions--they that protect mankind--that the strong mind  that seeketh enlightenment by self-effort is vain and impotent.    278. The Buddhas in the Ten Regions, innumerable as the sands of  Ganges, bear witness that very few are there of men in this sinful  world and decaying time that attain unto the true faith.    279. If we accept not the two divine gifts, the gift of entering the  Promised Kingdom, and the gift of return into this evil world, then  shall the wheel of birth and death turn with us for ever. And how  shall we endure to sink into the sea of suffering?    280. Whoso believeth the marvellous wisdom of that Blessed One,  shall be joined unto them that return no more unto birth and  death. And when, possessed of excelling knowledge, such a man is  born into Paradise, soon shall he attain unto the Perfected Wisdom.    281. It is the sole way unto the Promised Land that man should  believe the wisdom that is beyond human knowledge, of the  Enlightened One. Yet it is of all hard things hardest to attain unto  the Faith, the true way that leadeth to Paradise.    282. Casting aside the sorrow of birth and death, that sorrow which  is timeless in its beginning, I hope now solely for the Great  Nirvana. There is no end to my thankfulness for the two mighty gifts  of our Eternal Father.    283. Few are the believers that shall be born into the Land that is  promised, but many are they that shall be born into the Temporal  Paradise. Because the hope that we shall see Light by our own  strength is vain, having no foundation, we have therefore drifted on  the ocean of birth and death for many myriads of Kalpas.    284. Because in the gift of the Holy Name is a grace great and  wonderful, if man attain unto the gift of departing, that of itself  shall guide him unto the gift of returning.    285. Through the great mercy of the gift of departing shall we  attain unto the compassion of the gift of returning. If it were not  the free gift of the Blessed One, how should we attain unto wisdom  in the Land of Purity.    286. The Buddha of the Infinite Light, together with the  Bodhisattvas of Compassion and Wisdom, having taken the Ark of the  Divine Promise, that is voyaging on the ocean of birth and death,  have gathered and saved mankind therewith.    287. Whoso in heart and soul believeth the Divine Promise of the  Buddha of Infinite Light must diligently recite the Holy Name both  sleeping and waking.    288. Those men in the hierarchy of Sages that have trusted unto  self-effort for the means of attaining wisdom, on entering into the  heritage of the Divine Promise believe in it as in the Reason that  transcendeth all reason.    289. Though the teachings of the Lord stand for ever, yet unto none  is it possible to follow them in exactness, and therefore is there  none that may attain unto supreme enlightenment in these last days  of the falling away.    290. In India, in China, and the land of Japan, may the many  teachers of the doctrine of the Land of Purity, with compassion and  tender acceptance, persuade mankind to strive unto the true faith  that they may be joined unto those that return no more unto birth  and death.    291. Even as His friends the Lord commendeth those men that, having  attained unto the true faith taught of the Blessed One unto us,  dwell within the joy of holiness.    292. It is very meet that our souls rejoice exceedingly in the grace  of the great compassion of the Buddha. Yea, even to the extinction  of the body. And for the gracious giving of our spiritual teachers  we must in like manner rejoice, yea, though our very bones be  broken.      CONCERNING BELIEF AND DOUBT    293. Whoso comprehendeth not the wisdom of the Enlightened One, and  doubteth concerning His illumination, shall rise no higher than the  Outermost Places, for he hath trusted in the power of Reward, and  hath relied upon the principle of morality.    294. Whoso doubteth the wisdom of the Enlightened One--that wisdom  beyond all human understanding--and reciteth the Holy Name, trusting  in the merit of himself, shall not rise beyond the outermost bounds  of the Pure Land that is the Temporal Paradise, for he hath not the  grace of right thankfulness for His Compassion.    295. Whoso shall accept the doctrine of rewards and doubteth the  wisdom of Him that hath Light that surpasseth all knowledge of man,  shall be made captive in Doubting Castle, and the three jewels of  the faith shall no more be his.    296. For his sin, in that he hath doubted the wisdom of the  Enlightened One, shall he remain in the Outermost Places of the Land  of Purity. And for as much as we are taught that the sin of doubt  is grievous, we are also instructed that he must there dwell for  many Kalpas.    297. If the prince committeth a sin against his Father, even the  Chakravarti, the King, he is fettered as a prisoner, though the  chain be of gold.    298. Whoso reciteth the Holy Name, and so doeth as a work of  self-merit, shall be bound in the prison of the sevenfold gems, for  he believeth not right by the divine promise of that Holy One, and  heavy is the sin of his doubting.    299. Yet he even that hath a doubting soul and sinneth the sin of  self-merit, must needs strive to comprehend the merciful goodness of  the Blessed One, and he shall recite the Holy Name if he would at  all be equalled unto him that holdeth the true faith.    300. It is the Law that he who soweth shall reap what he soweth,  therefore the man that is full of righteous deeds for the sake of  self-merit shall enter into the prison of the sevenfold gems, for he  doubteth the marvellous wisdom of Him that hath the Light.    301. Whoso doubteth of the wisdom of Him that hath Light beyond the  imagining of man, and trusteth to the root of goodness and  virtue--he shall not attain unto the Soul of Great Mercy, for he is  born into the Outermost Places of Paradise, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy — Complete (#8)"],[1,"Finlarig near  Killin. Mr. Graham of Killearn, the Duke of Montrose's relation and  factor, Sheriff-depute also of Dumbartonshire, accompanied the troops,  that they might act under the civil authority, and have the assistance of  a trusty guide well acquainted with the hills. It was the object of these  several columns to arrive about the same time in the neighbourhood of Rob  Roy's residence, and surprise him and his followers. But heavy rains, the  difficulties of the country, and the good intelligence which the Outlaw  was always supplied with, disappointed their well-concerted combination.  The troops, finding the birds were flown, avenged themselves by  destroying the nest. They burned Rob Roy's house,--though not with  impunity; for the MacGregors, concealed among the thickets and cliffs,  fired on them, and killed a grenadier.    Rob Roy avenged himself for the loss which he sustained on this occasion  by an act of singular audacity. About the middle of November 1716, John  Graham of Killearn, already mentioned as factor of the Montrose family,  went to a place called Chapel Errock, where the tenants of the Duke were  summoned to appear with their termly rents. They appeared accordingly,  and the factor had received ready money to the amount of about L300, when  Rob Roy entered the room at the head of an armed party. The Steward  endeavoured to protect the Duke's property by throwing the books of  accounts and money into a garret, trusting they might escape notice. But  the experienced freebooter was not to be baffled where such a prize was  at stake. He recovered the books and cash, placed himself calmly in the  receipt of custom, examined the accounts, pocketed the money, and gave  receipts on the Duke's part, saying he would hold reckoning with the Duke  of Montrose out of the damages which he had sustained by his Grace's  means, in which he included the losses he had suffered, as well by the  burning of his house by General Cadogan, as by the later expedition  against Craig-Royston. He then requested Mr. Graham to attend him; nor  does it appear that he treated him with any personal violence, or even  rudeness, although he informed him he regarded him as a hostage, and  menaced rough usage in case he should be pursued, or in danger of being  overtaken. Few more audacious feats have been performed. After some rapid  changes of place (the fatigue attending which was the only annoyance that  Mr. Graham seems to have complained of), he carried his prisoner to an  island on Loch Katrine, and caused him to write to the Duke, to state  that his ransom was fixed at L3400 merks, being the balance which  MacGregor pretended remained due to him, after deducting all that he owed  to the Duke of Montrose.    However, after detaining Mr. Graham five or six days in custody on the  island, which is still called Rob Roy's Prison, and could be no  comfortable dwelling for November nights, the Outlaw seems to have  despaired of attaining further advantage from his bold attempt, and  suffered his prisoner to depart uninjured, with the account-books, and  bills granted by the tenants, taking especial care to retain the cash.*    * The reader will find two original letters of the Duke of Montrose, with  that which Mr. Graham of Killearn despatched from his prison-house by the  Outlaw's command, in the Appendix, No. II.    About 1717, our Chieftain had the dangerous adventure of falling into the  hands of the Duke of Athole, almost as much his enemy as the Duke of  Montrose himself; but his cunning and dexterity again freed him from  certain death. See a contemporary account of this curious affair in the  Appendix, No. V.    Other pranks are told of Rob, which argue the same boldness and sagacity  as the seizure of Killearn. The Duke of Montrose, weary of his insolence,  procured a quantity of arms, and distributed them among his tenantry, in  order that they might defend themselves against future violences. But  they fell into different hands from those they were intended for. The  MacGregors made separate attacks on the houses of the tenants, and  disarmed them all one after another, not, as was supposed, without the  consent of many of the persons so disarmed.    As a great part of the Duke's rents were payable in kind, there were  girnels (granaries) established for storing up the corn at Moulin, and  elsewhere on the Buchanan estate. To these storehouses Rob Roy used to  repair with a sufficient force, and of course when he was least expected,  and insist upon the delivery of quantities of grain--sometimes for his  own use, and sometimes for the assistance of the country people; always  giving regular receipts in his own name, and pretending to reckon with  the Duke for what sums he received.    In the meanwhile a garrison was established by Government, the ruins of  which may be still seen about half-way betwixt Loch Lomond and Loch  Katrine, upon Rob Roy's original property of Inversnaid. Even this  military establishment could not bridle the restless MacGregor. He  contrived to surprise the little fort, disarm the soldiers, and destroy  the fortification. It was afterwards re-established, and again taken by  the MacGregors under Rob Roy's nephew Ghlune Dhu, previous to the  insurrection of 1745-6. Finally, the fort of Inversnaid was a third time  repaired after the extinction of civil discord; and when we find the  celebrated General Wolfe commanding in it, the imagination is strongly  affected by the variety of time and events which the circumstance brings  simultaneously to recollection. It is now totally dismantled.*    * About 1792, when the author chanced to pass that way while on a tour  through the Highlands, a garrison, consisting of a single veteran, was  still maintained at Inversnaid. The venerable warder was reaping his  barley croft in all peace and tranquillity and when we asked admittance  to repose ourselves, he told us we would find the key of the Fort under  the door.    It was not, strictly speaking, as a professed depredator that Rob Roy now  conducted his operations, but as a sort of contractor for the police; in  Scottish phrase, a lifter of black-mail. The nature of this contract has  been described in the Novel of Waverley, and in the notes on that work.  Mr. Grahame of Gartmore's description of the character may be here  transcribed:--    \"The confusion and disorders of the country were so great, and the  Government go absolutely neglected it, that the sober people were obliged  to purchase some security to their effects by shameful and ignominious  contracts of _black-mail._ A person who had the greatest correspondence  with the thieves was agreed with to preserve the lands contracted for  from thefts, for certain sums to be paid yearly. Upon this fund he  employed one half of the thieves to recover stolen cattle, and the other  half of them to steal, in order to make this agreement and black-mail  contract necessary. The estates of those gentlemen who refused to  contract, or give countenance to that pernicious practice, are plundered  by the thieving part of the watch, in order to force them to purchase  their protection. Their leader calls himself the _Captain_ of the  _Watch,_ and his banditti go by that name. And as this gives them a kind  of authority to traverse the country, so it makes them capable of doing  any mischief. These corps through the Highlands make altogether a very  considerable body of men, inured from their infancy to the greatest  fatigues, and very capable, to act in a military way when occasion  offers.    \"People who are ignorant and enthusiastic, who are in absolute dependence  upon their chief or landlord, who are directed in their consciences by  Roman Catholic priests, or nonjuring clergymen, and who are not masters  of any property, may easily be formed into any mould. They fear no  dangers, as they have nothing to lose, and so can with ease be induced to  attempt anything. Nothing can make their condition worse: confusions and  troubles do commonly indulge them in such licentiousness, that by these  they better it.\"*    * Letters from the North of Scotland, vol. ii. pp. 344, 345.    As the practice of contracting for black-mail was an obvious  encouragement to rapine, and a great obstacle to the course of justice,  it was, by the statute 1567, chap. 21, declared a capital crime both on  the part of him who levied and him who paid this sort of tax. But the  necessity of the case prevented the execution of this severe law, I  believe, in any one instance; and men went on submitting to a certain  unlawful imposition rather than run the risk of utter ruin--just as it is  now found difficult or impossible to prevent those who have lost a very  large sum of money by robbery, from compounding with the felons for  restoration of a part of their booty.    At what rate Rob Roy levied black-mail I never heard stated; but there is  a formal contract by which his nephew, in 1741, agreed with various  landholders of estates in the counties of Perth, Stirling, and Dumbarton,  to recover cattle stolen from them, or to pay the value within six months  of the loss being intimated, if such intimation were made to him with  sufficient despatch, in consideration of a payment of L5 on each L100 of  valued rent, which was not a very heavy insurance. Petty thefts were not  included in the contract; but the theft of one horse, or one head of  black cattle, or of sheep exceeding the number of six, fell under the  agreement.    Rob Roy's profits upon such contracts brought him in a considerable  revenue in money or cattle, of which he made a popular use; for he was  publicly liberal as well as privately beneficent. The minister of the  parish of Balquhidder, whose name was Robertson, was at one time  threatening to pursue the parish for an augmentation of his stipend. Rob  Roy took an opportunity to assure him that he would do well to abstain  from this new exaction--a hint"]]]
