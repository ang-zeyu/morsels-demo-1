[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#8)"],[1,"previous interview, when matters had been the other way about, that  small affair of the pound on the second morning of the term. Then there  flashed across his mind certain reasons against this move. At present  Farnie's attitude towards him was unpleasantly independent. He made him  understand that he went about with him from choice, and that there was  to be nothing of the patron and dependant about their alliance. If he  were to lend him the two pounds now, things would alter. And to have  got a complete hold over Master Reginald Farnie, Monk would have paid  more than two pounds. Farnie had the intelligence to carry through  anything, however risky, and there were many things which Monk would  have liked to do, but, owing to the risks involved, shirked doing for  himself. Besides, he happened to be in funds just now.    'Well, look here, old chap,' he said, 'let's have strict business  between friends. If you'll pay me back four quid at the end of term,  you shall have the two pounds. How does that strike you?'    It struck Farnie, as it would have struck most people, that if this was  Monk's idea of strict business, there were the makings of no ordinary  financier in him. But to get his two pounds he would have agreed to  anything. And the end of term seemed a long way off.    The awkward part of the billiard-playing episode was that the  punishment for it, if detected, was not expulsion, but flogging. And  Farnie resembled the lady in _The Ingoldsby Legends_ who 'didn't  mind death, but who couldn't stand pinching'. He didn't mind  expulsion--he was used to it, but he could _not_ stand flogging.    'That'll be all right,' he said. And the money changed hands.          [6]    --AND STAYS THERE      'I say,' said Baker of Jephson's excitedly some days later, reeling  into the study which he shared with Norris, '_have_ you seen the  team the M.C.C.'s bringing down?'    At nearly every school there is a type of youth who asks this question  on the morning of the M.C.C. match. Norris was engaged in putting the  finishing touches to a snow-white pair of cricket boots.    'No. Hullo, where did you raise that Sporter? Let's have a look.'    But Baker proposed to conduct this business in person. It is ten times  more pleasant to administer a series of shocks to a friend than to sit  by and watch him administering them to himself. He retained _The  Sportsman_, and began to read out the team.    'Thought Middlesex had a match,' said Norris, as Baker paused  dramatically to let the name of a world-famed professional sink in.    'No. They don't play Surrey till Monday.'    'Well, if they've got an important match like Surrey on on Monday,'  said Norris disgustedly, 'what on earth do they let their best man come  down here today for, and fag himself out?'    Baker suggested gently that if anybody was going to be fagged out at  the end of the day, it would in all probability be the Beckford  bowlers, and not a man who, as he was careful to point out, had run up  a century a mere three days ago against Yorkshire, and who was  apparently at that moment at the very top of his form.    'Well,' said Norris, 'he might crock himself or anything. Rank bad  policy, I call it. Anybody else?'    Baker resumed his reading. A string of unknowns ended in another  celebrity.    'Blackwell?' said Norris. 'Not O. T. Blackwell?'    'It says A. T. But,' went on Baker, brightening up again, 'they always  get the initials wrong in the papers. Certain to be O. T. By the way, I  suppose you saw that he made eighty-three against Notts the other day?'    Norris tried to comfort himself by observing that Notts couldn't bowl  for toffee.    'Last week, too,' said Baker, 'he made a hundred and forty-six not out  against Malvern for the Gentlemen of Warwickshire. They couldn't get  him out,' he concluded with unction. In spite of the fact that he  himself was playing in the match today, and might under the  circumstances reasonably look forward to a considerable dose of  leather-hunting, the task of announcing the bad news to Norris appeared  to have a most elevating effect on his spirits:    'That's nothing extra special,' said Norris, in answer to the last item  of information, 'the Malvern wicket's like a billiard-table.'    'Our wickets aren't bad either at this time of year,' said Baker, 'and  I heard rumours that they had got a record one ready for this match.'    'It seems to me,' said Norris, 'that what I'd better do if we want to  bat at all today is to win the toss. Though Sammy and the Bishop and  Baynes ought to be able to get any ordinary side out all right.'    'Only this isn't an ordinary side. It's a sort of improved county  team.'    'They've got about four men who might come off, but the M.C.C.  sometimes have a bit of a tail. We ought to have a look in if we win  the toss.'    'Hope so,' said Baker. 'I doubt it, though.'    At a quarter to eleven the School always went out in a body to inspect  the pitch. After the wicket had been described by experts in hushed  whispers as looking pretty good, the bell rang, and all who were not  playing for the team, with the exception of the lucky individual who  had obtained for himself the post of scorer, strolled back towards the  blocks. Monk had come out with Waterford, but seeing Farnie ahead and  walking alone he quitted Waterford, and attached himself to the genial  Reginald. He wanted to talk business. He had not found the speculation  of the two pounds a very profitable one. He had advanced the money  under the impression that Farnie, by accepting it, was practically  selling his independence. And there were certain matters in which Monk  was largely interested, connected with the breaking of bounds and the  purchase of contraband goods, which he would have been exceedingly glad  to have performed by deputy. He had fancied that Farnie would have  taken over these jobs as part of his debt. But he had mistaken his man.  On the very first occasion when he had attempted to put on the screw,  Farnie had flatly refused to have anything to do with what he proposed.  He said that he was not Monk's fag--a remark which had the merit of  being absolutely true.    All this, combined with a slight sinking of his own funds, induced Monk  to take steps towards recovering the loan.    'I say, Farnie, old chap.'    'Hullo!'    'I say, do you remember my lending you two quid some time ago?'    'You don't give me much chance of forgetting it,' said Farnie.    Monk smiled. He could afford to be generous towards such witticisms.    'I want it back,' he said.    'All right. You'll get it at the end of term.'    'I want it now.'    'Why?'    'Awfully hard up, old chap.'    'You aren't,' said Farnie. 'You've got three pounds twelve and sixpence  half-penny. If you will keep counting your money in public, you can't  blame a chap for knowing how much you've got.'    Monk, slightly disconcerted, changed his plan of action. He abandoned  skirmishing tactics.    'Never mind that,' he said, 'the point is that I want that four pounds.  I'm going to have it, too.'    'I know. At the end of term.'    'I'm going to have it now.'    'You can have a pound of it now.'    'Not enough.'    'I don't see how you expect me to raise any more. If I could, do you  think I should have borrowed it? You might chuck rotting for a change.'    'Now, look here, old chap,' said Monk, 'I should think you'd rather  raise that tin somehow than have it get about that you'd been playing  pills at some pub out of bounds. What?'    Farnie, for one of the few occasions on record, was shaken out of his  usual _sang-froid_. Even in his easy code of morality there had  always been one crime which was an anathema, the sort of thing no  fellow could think of doing. But it was obviously at this that Monk was  hinting.    'Good Lord, man,' he cried, 'you don't mean to say you're thinking of  sneaking? Why, the fellows would boot you round the field. You couldn't  stay in the place a week.'    'There are heaps of ways,' said Monk, 'in which a thing can get about  without anyone actually telling the beaks. At present I've not told a  soul. But, you know, if I let it out to anyone they might tell someone  else, and so on. And if everybody knows a thing, the beaks generally  get hold of it sooner or later. You'd much better let me have that four  quid, old chap.'    Farnie capitulated.    'All right,' he said, 'I'll get it somehow.'    'Thanks awfully, old chap,' said Monk, 'so long!'    In all Beckford there was only one person who was in the least degree  likely to combine the two qualities necessary for the extraction of  Farnie from his difficulties. These qualities were--in the first place  ability, in the second place willingness to advance him, free of  security, the four pounds he required. The person whom he had in his  mind was Gethryn. He had reasoned the matter out step by step during  the second half of morning school. Gethryn, though he had, as Farnie  knew, no overwhelming amount of affection for his uncle, might in a  case of great need prove blood to be thicker (as per advertisement)  than water. But, he reflected, he must represent himself as in danger  of expulsion rather than flogging. He had an uneasy idea that if the  Bishop were to discover that all he stood to get was a flogging, he  would remark with enthusiasm that, as far as he was concerned, the good  work might go on. Expulsion was different. To save a member of his  family from expulsion, he might think it worth while to pass round the  hat amongst his wealthy acquaintances. If four plutocrats with four  sovereigns were to combine, Farnie, by their united efforts, would be  saved. And he rather liked the notion of being turned into a sort of  limited liability company, like the Duke of Plaza Toro, at a pound a  share. It seemed to add a certain dignity to his position.    To Gethryn's study, therefore, he went directly school was over. If he  had reflected, he might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#8)"],[1,"parts of the body recognize smaller differences in weight,  and the right hand is more accurate than the left. We are very apt,  however, to judge of the weight of a body from previous conceptions. Thus,  shortly after Sir Humphrey Davy discovered the metal potassium, he placed  a piece of it in the hand of Dr. Pierson, who exclaimed: \"Bless me! How  heavy it is!\" Really, however, potassium is so light that it will float on  water like cork.] By balancing it in the hand. The muscular sense is  useful to us in many ways. It guides us in standing or moving. We gratify  it when we walk erect and with an elastic step, and by dancing, jumping,  skating, and gymnastic exercises.    NECESSITY OF EXERCISE.--The effect of exercise upon a muscle is very  marked. [Footnote: The greater size of the breast (pectoral muscle) of a  pigeon, as compared with that of a duck, shows how muscle increases with  use. The breast of a chicken is white because it is not used for flight,  and therefore gets little blood.] By use it grows larger, and becomes  hard, compact, and darker-colored; by disuse it decreases in size, and  becomes soft, flabby, and pale.    Violent exercise, however, is injurious, since we then tear down faster  than nature can build up. Feats of strength are not only hurtful, but  dangerous. Often the muscles are strained or ruptured, and blood vessels  burst in the effort to outdo one's companions. [Footnote: Instances have  been known of children falling dead from having carried to excess so  pleasant and healthful an amusement as jumping the rope, and of persons  rupturing the Tendon of Achilles in dancing. The competitive lifting of  heavy weights is unwise, sometimes fatal.] (See p. 278.)    Two thousand years ago, Isocrates, the Greek rhetorician, said: \"Exercise  for health, not for strength.\" The cultivation of muscle for its own sake  is a return to barbarism, while it enfeebles the mind, and ultimately the  body. The ancient gymnasts are said to have become prematurely old, and  the trained performers of our own day soon suffer from the strain they put  upon their muscular system. Few men have sufficient vigor to become both  athletes and scholars. Exercise should, therefore, merely supplement the  deficiency of our usual employment. _A sedentary life needs daily,  moderate exercise, which always stops short of fatigue_. This is a law  of health. (See p. 280.)    No education is complete which fails to provide for the development of the  muscles. Recesses should be as strictly devoted to play as study hours are  to work. Were gymnastics or calisthenics as regular an exercise as grammar  or arithmetic, fewer pupils would be compelled to leave school on account  of ill health; while spinal curvatures, weak backs, and ungraceful gaits  would no longer characterize so many of our best institutions.    TIME FOR EXERCISE.--We should not exercise after long abstinence from  food, nor immediately after a meal, unless the meal or the exercise be  very light. There is an old-fashioned prejudice in favor of exercise  before breakfast--an hour suited to the strong and healthy, but entirely  unfitted to the weak and delicate. On first rising in the morning, the  pulse is low, the skin relaxed, and the system susceptible to cold. Feeble  persons, therefore, need to be braced with food before they brave the  outdoor air.    WHAT KIND OF EXCERCISE TO TAKE.--For children, games are unequaled.  Walking, the universal exercise, [Footnote: The custom of walking, so  prevalent in England, has doubtless much to do with the superior physique  of its people. It is considered nothing for a woman to take a walk of  eight or ten miles, and long pedestrian excursions are made to all parts  of the country. The benefits which accrue from such an open-air life are  sadly needed by the women of our own land. A walk of half a dozen miles  should be a pleasant recreation for any healthy person.] is beneficial, as  it takes one into the open air and sunlight. Running is better, since it  employs more muscles, but it must not be pushed to excess, as it taxes the  heart, and may lead to disease of that organ. Rowing is more effectual in  its general development of the system. Swimming employs the muscles of the  whole body, and is a valuable acquirement, as it may be the means of  saving life. Horseback riding is a fine accomplishment, and refreshes both  mind and body. Gymnastic or calisthenic exercises bring into play all the  muscles of the body, and when carefully selected, and not immoderately  employed, are preferable to any other mode of indoor exercise. [Footnote:  The employment of the muscles in exercise not only benefits their especial  structure, but it acts on the whole system. When the muscles are put in  action, the capillary blood vessels with which they are supplied become  more rapidly charged with blood, and active changes take place, not only  in the muscles, but in all the surrounding tissues. The heart is required  to supply more blood, and accordingly beats more rapidly in order to meet  the demand. A larger quantity of blood is sent through the lungs, and  larger supplies of oxygen are taken in and carried to the various tissues.  The oxygen, by combining with the carbon of the blood and the tissues,  engenders a larger quantity of heat, which produces an action on the skin,  in order that the superfluous warmth may be disposed of. The skin is thus  exercised, as it were, and the sudoriparous and sebaceous glands are set  at work. The lungs and skin are brought into operation, and the lungs  throw off large quantities of carbonic acid, and the skin large quantities  of water, containing in solution matters which, if retained, would produce  disease in the body. Wherever the blood is sent, changes of a healthful  character occur. The brain and the rest of the nervous system are  invigorated, the stomach has its powers of digestion improved, and the  liver, pancreas, and other organs perform their functions with more vigor.  By want of exercise, the constituents of the food which pass into the  blood are not oxidized, and products which produce disease are engendered.  The introduction of fresh supplies of oxygen induced by exercise oxidizes  these products, and renders them harmless. As a rule, those who exercise  most in the open air will live the longest.--LANKESTER.] (See p. 280.)    THE WONDERS OF THE MUSCLES.--The grace, ease, and rapidity with which the  muscles contract are astonishing. By practice, they acquire a facility  which we call mechanical. The voice may utter one thousand five hundred  letters in a minute, yet each requires a distinct position of the vocal  organs. We train the muscles of the fingers till they glide over the keys  of the piano, executing the most exquisite and difficult harmony. In  writing, each letter is formed by its peculiar motions, yet we make them  so unconsciously that a skillful penman will describe beautiful curves  while thinking only of the idea that the sentence is to express. The mind  of the violinist is upon the music which his right hand is executing,  while his left determines the length of the string and the character of  each note so carefully that not a false sound is heard, although the  variation of a hair's breadth would cause a discord. In the arm of a  blacksmith, the biceps muscle may grow into the solidity almost of a club;  the hand of a prize fighter will strike a blow like a sledge hammer; while  the engraver traces lines invisible to the naked eye, and the fingers of  the blind acquire a delicacy that almost supplies the place of the missing  sense.    DISEASES, ETC.--l. _St. Vitus's Dance_ is a disease of the voluntary  muscles, whereby they are in frequent, irregular, and spasmodic motion  beyond the control of the will. All causes of excitement, and especially  of fear, should be avoided, and the general health of the patient  invigorated, as this disease is closely connected with a derangement of  the nervous system.    2. _Convulsions_ are an involuntary contraction of the muscles.  Consciousness is wanting, while the limbs may be stiff or in spasmodic  action. (See p. 261.)    3. _Locked-jaw_ is a disease in which there are spasms and a  contraction of the muscles, usually beginning in the lower jaw. It is  serious, often fatal, yet it sometimes follows as trivial an injury as the  stroke of a whip lash, the lodgment of a bone in the throat, a fishhook in  the finger, or a tack in the sole of the foot.    4. _Gout_ is characterized by an acute pain located chiefly in the  small joints of the foot, especially those of the great toe, which become  swollen and extremely sensitive. It is generally accompanied by an excess  of uric acid in the blood, and a deposit of urate of soda about the  affected joint. Gout is often the result of high living, and of too much  animal food. It is frequently inherited.    5. _Rheumatism_ affects mainly the connective, white, fibrous tissue  of the larger joints. While gout is the punishment of the rich who live  luxuriously, rheumatism afflicts alike the poor and the rich. There are  two common forms of rheumatism--the inflammatory or acute, and the  chronic. The latter is of long continuance; the former terminates more  speedily. The acute form is probably a disease of the blood, which carries  with it some poisonous matter that is deposited where the fibrous tissue  is most abundant. The disease flies capriciously from one joint to  another, and the pain caused by even the slightest motion deprives the  sufferer of the use of the disabled part and its muscles. Its chief danger  lies in the possibility of its affecting the vital organs. Chronic  rheumatism--the result of repeated attacks of the acute--leads to great  suffering, and oftentimes to disorganization of the joints and an  interference with the movements of the heart.    6. _Lumbago_ is an inflammation of the lumbar muscles and fascia.
