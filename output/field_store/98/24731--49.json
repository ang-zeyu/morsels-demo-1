For not to me alone, but to all, they played this role of  servant, priest, and comforter.    As I write these lines I wonder where their spirits are now.  Speeded thence, they may have already made the next world  richer by their coming. I do not know that; but I do know that they  have made my soul infinitely richer by their sojourn here; I do not  know whether they were Catholic or Atheist, but I do know how  truly the Master of all souls could say to these two brave little  Belgians: \"When I was an hungered, ye gave me food; when I was  thirsty, ye gave me drink; when I was a stranger, ye took me in;  when I was sick and in prison, ye visited me.\"    The prison is the real maker of democracy. I saw that clearly when,  at five o'clock, joy came marching into the room. It was an officer  who was its herald with the simple words, \"The theater manager is  free.\" That was a trumpet blast annihilating all rank and caste. The  manager, forgetting his office and his dignity, and embracing with  his right arm a peasant and with his left an artisan, danced round  the room in a delirium of delight. Twenty men were at one time  besieging him to grasp his hand, and tears, not rhetorically, but  actually, were streaming down their faces--Russian, German,  Belgian, and American, high and low, countrymen and citymen,  smocked and frocked. We were fused altogether in the common  emotion of joy and hope. For hope was now rampant. \"If one man  can be liberated,\" we argued, \"why not another? Perhaps the  General was thus giving vent to a temporary vein of good humor.\"  Each man figured that he might be the fortunate one upon whom  this good luck would alight.    At five-thirty there was much murmuring in the corridor, and  presently my Ehrenwort lad of the previous night came bursting  into the room, crying, \"The American! The American!\" I do not  have to describe the thrill of joy that those words shot through me;  but I wish that I might do justice to the beaming face of my young  officer friend. I am sure that I could not have looked more radiant  than he did when, almost like a mother, he led me forth to greet de  Leval and two other assistants from the American Ambassador.  Now de Leval is not built on any sylph-like plan, but he looked to  me then like an ethereal being from another world--the angel who  opened the prison door.    I presumed that I was to walk away without further ado; but not so  easy. We proceeded into another office, where the whole  assemblage was standing. I have no idea who the high superior  officer was; but he held in his hand a blue book which contained a  long report of my case, with all the documents except the defense  I had written. Again I was cross-examined, and my papers were  carefully passed upon one by one.    One they could not or would not overlook, and to it throughout all  this last examination they kept perpetually referring. When I had  made my thirty-seven-mile journey into Liege on August 20,1 had  secured this paper at Maastricht signed by the Dutch and German  authorities. Over the Dutch seal were the words, \"To the passing  over the boundary into Belgian-Germany of Mr. Albert Williams  there exists on the part of the undersigned no objection. Signed,  The Commissioner of Police Souten.\" Over the German seal were  the words, \"At the Imperial German Vice-Consulate the foregoing  signature is hereby attested to be that of Souten, the Police  Commissioner of Maastricht.\" For this beautifully non-committal  affair I had delivered up six marks. I would have cheerfully paid six  hundred to disown it now.    \"What explanation is there for his possession of that paper?\"  asked the General sternly.    De Leval pleaded cleverly, dilating upon the natural inquisitiveness  and roaming disposition of the American race.    \"I know what the Wanderlust is,\" said the General, \"but I fail to  understand the peculiar desire of this man to travel only in  dangerous and forbidden war zones.\"    \"In the second place,\" the General continued, \"there is no doubt  that he has made some remark to the effect that in the long run  Germany cannot win. That was overheard by an officer in a cafe  and is undeniable. The other charges we will for the time waive,\"  said the General, drawing himself up with a fine hauteur. \"But his  identifying evidence is very flimsy. Can you produce any better?\"    Suddenly I bethought me of the gold watch in my pocket. It was a  presentation from some two hundred people of small means in an  industrial district in Boston. Three of the aides successively and  successfully damaged their thumbnails in their eagerness to pry  open the back cover. That is a source of considerable satisfaction  to me now; but it was embarrassing in that delicate situation when  my fate hung almost by a thread, and a trifle could delay my  release for days. If the General damaged his own thumb on it, I  feel sure that I would have been remanded back to prison. But,  luckily, the cover sprang open and revealed to the eyes the words:  \"From friends at Maverick.\"    De Leval adroitly turned this to the best advantage. It was the last  straw. The General capitulated. Walking over into the adjoining  room, he wrote on the blue folder: \"Er ist frei gelassen.\" I would  give lots for those folders; but, though safety was by no means  certain, I found I yet had nerve enough to take a venture. When I  was bidden to pick up my papers strewn across the desk, I tried  my best to gather in some of the other documents. Besides the  copies of the letter I wrote to the Ambassador the only thing I got  on my case was this letter, written by Mr. Whitlock to Baron von de  Lancken, the official German representative in charge of the  dealings with the American Embassy. It has the well-known  Whitlock straight-from-the-shoulder point and brevity to it.      BRUXELLES, le 29 Septembre, 1914, EXCELLENCE:    J'apprends a l'instant que Mr. Williams, citoyen Americain  residente a l'Hotel Metropole, aurait ete arrete lundi par les  Autorites allemande.    Pour le cas ou il n'aurait pas encore ete mis en liberte, je vous  saurais gre de me faire connaitre les raisons de cette arrestation,  et de me donner le moyen de communiquer aussitot avec lui, pour  pourvoir eventuellement lui fournir toute protection dont il pourrait  avoir besoin.    Veuillez agreer, Excellence, la nouvelle assurance de ma haute  consideration.    (S) BRAND WHITLOCK. A Son Excellence Monsieur le Baron von  der Lancken, Bruxelles.      Before my final liberation I was escorted into the biggest and  busiest office of all.    Here I was given an Erlaubnis to travel by military train through  Liege into Germany, and from there on out by way of Holland. The  destination that I had in mind was Ghent, but passing through the  lines thereto was forbidden. Instead of going directly the thirty  miles in three hours, I must go around almost a complete circle,  about three hundred miles in three days. But nothing could take  the edge off my joy. A strange exhilaration and a wild desire to  celebrate possessed me. With such a mood I had not hitherto  been sympathetic; on the contrary, I had been much grieved by  the sundry manifestations of what I deemed a base spirit in certain  Belgians. One of them had said, \"Just wait until the Allies' army  comes marching into Brussels! Oh, then I am going out on one  glorious drunk!\" In the light of the splendid sacrifices of his fellow-  Belgians, this struck me as a shocking degradation of the human  spirit.    I could not then understand such a view-point. But I could now. In  the removal of the long abnormal tension one's pent-up spirits  seek out an equally abnormal channel for expression. I, too, felt  like an uncaged spirit suddenly let loose. I didn't get drunk, but I  very nearly got arrested again. In my headlong ecstasy I was deaf  to the warnings of a German guard saying, \"Passage into this  street is forbidden.\" I checked myself just in time, and in chastened  spirit made my way back to the Metropole.    Three times I was offered the prohibited Antwerp papers that had  been smuggled into the city and once the London Times for  twenty-five cents. The war price for this is said often to have run up  to as many dollars.    An English, woman, or at any rate a woman with a beautiful  English accent, opened a conversation with the remark that she  was going directly through to Ghent on the following day and that  she knew how to go right through the German lines. That was  precisely the way that the Germans had just forbidden me to go.  But this accomplice (if such she was) got no rise out of me. To all  intents I was stone-deaf. Compared to me, she would have found  the Sphinx garrulous indeed. She may have been as harmless as  a dove but, after my escapade, I wouldn't have talked to my own  mother without a written permit from the military governor. The  Kaiser himself would have found it hard work breaking through my  cast-iron spy-proof armor of formality. I had good reason, too, not  to let down the bars, for I was trailed by the spy-hunters. Not until  ten days later when I passed over the Holland border did I feel  release from their vigilant eyes. My key at the Metropole was never  returned to me and I know that my room was searched once, if not  twice, after my return to the hotel.    It would be interesting to see how all this tallies with the official  report of my case in the archives at Berlin. Perhaps some of these  surmises have shot far wide of the mark. Javert, for instance, may  not be a direct descendant of the ancient Inquisitor who had  charge of the rack and the thumb screws, as I believed. In his own  home town he may be a sort of mild-mannered schoolmaster and  probably is highly astounded as well as gratified to find himself  cast as the villain in this piece. Perhaps I may have been at "]]]
