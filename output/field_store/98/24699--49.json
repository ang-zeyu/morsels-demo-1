PUSSY-CAT BY THE FIRE  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10611"],[0,"An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the (#9)"],[1,"of  bribery and corruption, a communication with the natives. These plans  were put into immediate execution. The Europeans erected their  forts[032]; landed their merchandize; and endeavoured, by a peaceable  deportment, by presents, and by every appearance of munificence, to  seduce the attachment and confidence of the Africans. These schemes had  the desired effect. The gaudy trappings of European art, not only caught  their attention, but excited their curiosity: they dazzled the eyes and  bewitched the senses, not only of those, to whom they were given, but of  those, to whom they were shewn. Thus followed a speedy intercourse with  each other, and a confidence, highly favourable to the views of avarice  or ambition.    It was now time for the Europeans to embrace the opportunity, which this  intercourse had thus afforded them, of carrying their schemes into  execution, and of fixing them on such a permanent foundation, as should  secure them future success. They had already discovered, in the  different interviews obtained, the chiefs of the African tribes. They  paid their court therefore to these, and so compleatly intoxicated their  senses with the luxuries, which they brought from home, as to be able to  seduce them to their designs. A treaty of peace and commerce was  immediately concluded: it was agreed, that the kings, on their part,  should, from this period, sentence _prisoners of war_ and _convicts_  to _European servitude_; and that the Europeans should supply them, in  return, with the luxuries of the north. This agreement immediately took  place; and thus begun that _commerce_, which makes so considerable a  figure at the present day.    But happy had the Africans been, if those only, who had been justly  convicted of crimes, or taken in a just war, had been sentenced to the  severities of servitude! How many of those miseries, which afterwards  attended them, had been never known; and how would their history have  saved those sighs and emotions of pity, which must now ever accompany  its perusal. The Europeans, on the establishment of their western  colonies, required a greater number of slaves than a strict adherence to  the treaty could produce. The princes therefore had only the choice of  relinquishing the commerce, or of consenting to become unjust. They had  long experienced the emoluments of the trade; they had acquired a taste  for the luxuries it afforded; and they now beheld an opportunity of  gratifying it, but in a more extentive manner. _Avarice_ therefore,  which was too powerful for _justice_ on this occasion, immediately  turned the scale: not only those, who were fairly convicted of offences,  were now sentenced to servitude, but even those who were _suspected_.  New crimes were invented, that new punishments might succeed. Thus was  every appearance soon construed into reality; every shadow into a  substance; and often virtue into a crime.    Such also was the case with respect to prisoners of war. Not only those  were now delivered into slavery, who were taken in a state of publick  enmity and injustice, but those also, who, conscious of no injury  whatever, were taken in the _arbitrary_ skirmishes of these _venal_  sovereigns. War was now made, not as formerly, from the motives of  retaliation and defence, but for the sake of obtaining prisoners alone,  and the advantages resulting from their sale. If a ship from Europe came  but into sight, it was now considered as a sufficient motive for a war,  and as a signal only for an instantaneous commencement of hostilities.    But if the African kings could be capable of such injustice, what vices  are there, that their consciences would restrain, or what enormities,  that we might not expect to be committed? When men once consent to be  unjust, they lose, at the same instant with their virtue, a considerable  portion of that sense of shame, which, till then, had been found a  successful protector against the sallies of vice. From that awful  period, almost every expectation is forlorn: the heart is left  unguarded: its great protector is no more: the vices therefore, which so  long encompassed it in vain, obtain an easy victory: in crouds they pour  into the defenceless avenues, and take possession of the soul: there is  nothing now too vile for them to meditate, too impious to perform. Such  was the situation of the despotick sovereigns of Africa. They had once  ventured to pass the bounds of virtue, and they soon proceeded to  enormity. This was particularly conspicuous in that general conduct,  which they uniformly observed, after any unsuccessful conflict.  Influenced only by the venal motives of European traffick, they first  made war upon the neighbouring tribes, contrary to every principle of  justice; and if, by the flight of the enemy, or by other contingencies,  they were disappointed of their prey, they made no hesitation of  immediately turning their arms against their own subjects. The first  villages they came to, were always marked on this occasion, as the first  objects of their avarice. They were immediately surrounded, were  afterwards set on fire, and the wretched inhabitants seized, as they  were escaping from the flames. These, consisting of whole families,  fathers, brothers, husbands, wives, and children, were instantly driven  in chains to the merchants, and consigned to slavery.    To these calamities, which thus arose from the tyranny of the kings, we  may now subjoin those, which arose from the avarice of private persons.  Many were kidnapped by their own countrymen, who, encouraged by the  merchants of Europe, previously lay in wait for them, and sold them  afterwards for slaves; while the seamen of the different ships, by every  possible artifice, enticed others on board, and transported them to the  regions of servitude.    As these practices are in full force at the present day, it appears that  there are four orders of _involuntary_ slaves on the African  continent; of [033]_convicts_; of _prisoners of war_; of  those, who are publickly seized by virtue of the _authority_ of  their prince; and of those, who are privately _kidnapped_ by  individuals.    It remains only to observe on this head, that in the sale and purchase  of these the African commerce or _Slave Trade_ consists; that they  are delivered to the merchants of Europe in exchange for their various  commodities; that these transport them to their colonies in the west,  where their _slavery_ takes place; and that a fifth order arises  there, composed of all such as are born to the native Africans, after  their transportation and slavery have commenced.    Having thus explained as much of the history of modern servitude, as is  sufficient for the prosecution of our design, we should have closed our  account here, but that a work, just published, has furnished us with a  singular anecdote of the colonists of a neighbouring nation, which we  cannot but relate. The learned [034]author, having described the method  which the Dutch colonists at the Cape make use of to take the Hottentots  and enslave them, takes occasion, in many subsequent parts of the work,  to mention the dreadful effects of the practice of slavery; which, as he  justly remarks, \"leads to all manner of misdemeanours and wickedness.  Pregnant women,\" says he, \"and children in their tenderest years, were  not at this time, neither indeed are they ever, exempt from the effects  of the hatred and spirit of vengeance constantly harboured by the  colonists, with respect to the [035]Boshies-man nation; _excepting such  indeed as are marked out to be carried away into bondage_.    \"Does a colonist at any time get sight of a Boshies-man, he takes fire  immediately, and spirits up his horse and dogs, in order to hunt him  with more ardour and fury than he would a wolf, or any other wild beast?  On an open plain, a few colonists on horseback are always sure to get  the better of the greatest number of Boshies-men that can be brought  together; as the former always keep at the distance of about an hundred,  or an hundred and fifty paces (just as they find it convenient) and  charging their heavy fire-arms with a very large kind of shot, jump off  their horses, and rest their pieces in their usual manner on their  ramrods, in order that they may shoot with the greater certainty; so  that the balls discharged by them will sometimes, as I have been  assured, go through the bodies of six, seven, or eight of the enemy at a  time, especially as these latter know no better than to keep close  together in a body.\"--    \"And not only is the capture of the Hottentots considered by them merely  as a party of pleasure, but in cold blood they destroy the bands which  nature has knit between their husbands, and their wives and children,  &c.\"    With what horrour do these passages seem to strike us! What indignation  do they seem to raise in our breasts, when we reflect, that a part of  the human species are considered as _game_, and that _parties of  pleasure_ are made for their _destruction_! The lion does not  imbrue his claws in blood, unless called upon by hunger, or provoked by  interruption; whereas the merciless Dutch, more savage than the brutes  themselves, not only murder their fellow-creatures without any  provocation or necessity, but even make a diversion of their sufferings,  and enjoy their pain.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 030: The following short history of the African servitude, is  taken from Astley's Collection of Voyages, and from the united  testimonies of Smyth, Adanson, Bosman, Moore, and others, who were  agents to the different factories established there; who resided many  years in the country; and published their respective histories at their  return. These writers, if they are partial at all, may be considered as  favourable rather to their own countrymen, than the unfortunate  Africans.]      [Footnote 031: "]]]
