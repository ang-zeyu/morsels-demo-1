Socrates, and after him Arcesilaus,  made their schollers to speake first, and then would speake  themselves. Obest plerumque iis qui discere volunt, auctoritas eorum  qui docent: [Footnote: CIC. De Nat. 1. i] \"Most commonly the  authoritie of them that teach, hinders them that would learne.\"    It is therefore meet that he make him first trot-on before him,  whereby he may the better judge of his pace, and so guesse how long  he will hold out, that accordingly he may fit his strength; for want  of which proportion we often marre all. And to know how to make a  good choice, and how far forth one may proceed (still keeping a due  measure), is one of the hardest labours I know. It is a signe of a  noble, and effect of an undanted spirit, to know how to second, and  how far forth he shall condescend to his childish proceedings, and  how to guide them. As for myselfe, I can better and with more  strength walke up than downe a hill. Those which, according to our  common fashion, undertake with one selfe-same lesson, and like maner  of education, to direct many spirits of divers formes and different  humours, it is no marvell if among a multitude of children, they  scarce meet with two or three that reap any good fruit by their  discipline, or that come to any perfection. I would not only have  him to demand an accompt of the words contained in his lesson, but  of the sense and substance thereof, and judge of the profit he hath  made of it, not by the testimonie of his memorie, but by the  witnesse of his life. That what he lately learned, he cause him to  set forth and pourtray the same into sundrie shapes, and then to  accommodate it to as many different and severall subjects, whereby  he shal perceive, whether he have yet apprehended the same, and  therein enfeoffed himselfe, [Footnote: Taken possession.] at due  times taking his instruction from the institution given by Plato. It  is a signe of cruditie and indigestion for a man to yeeld up his  meat, even as he swallowed the same; the stomacke hath not wrought  his full operation, unlesse it have changed forme, and altered  fashion of that which was given him to boyle and concoct.    [Wee see men gape after no reputation but learning, and when they  say, such a one is a learned man, they thinke they have said  enough;] Our minde doth move at others pleasure, and tyed and forced  to serve the fantasies of others, being brought under by authoritie,  and forced to stoope to the lure of their bare lesson; wee have  beene so subjected to harpe upon one string, that we have no way  left us to descant upon voluntarie; our vigor and libertie is cleane  extinct. Nunquam tutelae suae fiunt: \"They never come to their owne  tuition.\" It was my hap to bee familiarlie acquainted with an honest  man at Pisa, but such an Aristotelian, as he held this infallible  position; that a conformitie to Aristotles doctrine was the true  touchstone and squire [Footnote: Square.] of all solid imaginations  and perfect veritie; for, whatsoever had no coherencie with it, was  but fond Chimeraes and idle humors; inasmuch as he had knowne all,  seene all, and said all. This proposition of his being somewhat over  amply and injuriously interpreted by some, made him a long time  after to be troubled in the inquisition of Rome. I would have him  make his scholler narrowly to sift all things with discretion, and  harbour nothing in his head by mere authoritie, or upon trust.  Aristotles principles shall be no more axiomes unto him, than the  Stoikes or Epicurians. Let this diversitie of judgements be proposed  unto him, if he can, he shall be able to distinguish the truth from  falsehood, if not, he will remaine doubtful.         Che non men che saper dubbiar m'aggrata.       [Footnote: DANTE, Inferno, cant. xi. 93.]         No lesse it pleaseth me,       To doubt, than wise to be.    For if by his owne discourse he embrace the opinions of Xenophon or  of Plato, they shall be no longer theirs, but his. He that meerely  followeth another, traceth nothing, and seeketh nothing: Non sumus  sub Rege, sibi quisque se vindicet: [Footnote: SEN. Epist. xxxiii.]  \"We are not under a Kings command, every one may challenge himselfe,  for let him at least know that he knoweth.\" It is requisite he  endevour as much to feed himselfe with their conceits, as labour to  learne their precepts; which, so he know how to applie, let him  hardily forget, where or whence he had them. Truth and reason are  common to all, and are no more proper unto him that spake them  heretofore, then unto him that shall speake them hereafter. And it  is no more according to Platoes opinion than to mine, since both he  and I understand and see alike. The Bees do here and there sucke  this and cull that flower, but afterward they produce the hony,  which is peculiarly their owne, then is it no more Thyme or Majoram.  So of peeces borrowed of others, he may lawfully alter, transforme,  and confound them, to shape out of them a perfect peece of worke,  altogether his owne; alwaies provided his judgement, his travell,  [Footnote: Travail, labor.] studie, and institution tend to nothing,  but to frame the same perfect. Let him hardily conceale where or  whence he hath had any helpe, and make no shew of anything, but of  that which he hath made himselfe. Pirates, pilchers, and borrowers,  make a shew of their purchases and buildings, but not of that which  they have taken from others: you see not the secret fees or bribes  Lawyers take of their Clients, but you shall manifestly discover the  alliances they make, the honours they get for their children, and  the goodly houses they build. No man makes open shew of his receits,  but every one of his gettings. The good that comes of studie (or at  least should come) is to prove better, wiser and honester. It is the  understanding power (said Epicharmus) that seeth and heareth, it is  it that profiteth all and disposeth all, that moveth, swayeth, and  ruleth all: all things else are but blind, senselesse, and without  spirit. And truly in barring him of libertie to doe any thing of  himselfe, we make him thereby more servile and more coward. Who  would ever enquire of his scholler what he thinketh of Rhetorike, of  Grammar, of this or of that sentence of Cicero? Which things  thoroughly fethered (as if they were oracles) are let flie into our  memorie; in which both letters and syllables are substantiall parts  of the subject. To know by roat is no perfect knowledge, but to keep  what one hath committed to his memories charge, is commendable: what  a man directly knoweth, that will he dispose of, without turning  still to his booke or looking to his pattern. A meere bookish  sufficiencie is unpleasant. All I expect of it is an imbellishing of  my actions, and not a foundation of them, according to Platoes mind,  who saith, constancie, faith, and sinceritie are true Philosophie;  as for other Sciences, and tending elsewhere, they are but garish  paintings. I would faine have Paluel or Pompey, those two excellent  dauncers of our time, with all their nimblenesse, teach any man to  doe their loftie tricks and high capers, only with seeing them done,  and without stirring out of his place, as some Pedanticall fellowes  would instruct our minds without moving or putting it in practice.  And glad would I be to find one that would teach us how to manage a  horse, to tosse a pike, to shoot-off a peece, to play upon the lute,  or to warble with the voice, without any exercise, as these kind of  men would teach us to judge, and how to speake well, without any  exercise of speaking or judging. In which kind of life, or as I may  terme it, Prentiship, what action or object soever presents itselfe  into our eies, may serve us in stead of a sufficient booke. A  prettie pranke of a boy, a knavish tricke of a page, a foolish part  of a lackey, an idle tale or any discourse else, spoken either in  jest or earnest, at the table or in companie, are even as new  subjects for us to worke upon: for furtherance whereof, commerce or  common societie among men, visiting of forraine countries, and  observing of strange fashions, are verie necessary, not only to be  able (after the manner of our yong gallants of France) to report how  many paces the Church of Santa Rotonda is in length or breadth, or  what rich garments the curtezan Signora Livia weareth, and the worth  of her hosen; or as some do, nicely to dispute how much longer or  broader the face of Nero is, which they have seene in some old  ruines of Italie, than that which is made for him in other old  monuments else-where. But they should principally observe, and be  able to make certaine relation of the humours and fashions of those  countries they have seene, that they may the better know how to  correct and prepare their wits by those of others. I would therefore  have him begin even from his infancie to travell abroad; and first,  that at one shoot he may hit two markes he should see neighbour-  countries, namely where languages are most different from ours; for,  unlesse a mans tongue be fashioned unto them in his youth, he shall  never attaine to the true pronunciation of them if he once grow in  yeares. Moreover, we see it received as a common opinion of the  wiser sort, that it agreeth not with reason, that a childe be  alwaies nuzzled, cockered, dandled, and brought up in his parents  lap or sight; forsomuch as their naturall kindnesse, or (as I may  call it) tender fondnesse, causeth often, even the wisest to prove  so idle, so over-nice, and so base-minded. For parents are not  capable, neither can they find in their hearts to see them checkt,  corrected, or chastised, nor indure to see them brought up so  meanly, and so far from daintinesse, and many times so dangerously,  as they must needs be. And it would grieve them to see their  children come home from those exercises, that a Gentleman must  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56684"],[0,"The Lectures on Faith (#8)"],[1,"mind and will. [§ III. ¶ 3,4,5.]    Q. Would the idea of any one or two of the above-mentioned things  enable a person to exercise faith in God?    A. It would not, for without the idea of them all, faith would be  imperfect and unproductive. [§ III. ¶ 5.]    Q. Would an idea of these three things lay a sure foundation for the  exercise of faith in God, so as to obtain life and salvation?    A. It would; for by the idea of these three things, faith could become  perfect, and fruitful, abounding in righteousness unto the praise and  glory of God. [§ III. ¶ 5.]    Q. How are we to be made acquainted with the before mentioned things  respecting the Deity, and respecting ourselves?    A. By revelation. [§ III. ¶ 6.]    Q. Could these things be found out by any other means than by  revelation?    A. They could not.    Q. How do you prove it?    A. By the scriptures. Job 11:7,8:9. 1 Corinthians 2:9,10,11. [§ III. ¶  7.]    Q. What things do we learn in the revelations of God respecting his  character?    A. We learn the six following things: first, that he was God before  the world was created, and the same God that he was after it was  created. Secondly, that he is merciful and gracious, slow to anger,  abundant in goodness, and that he was so from everlasting, and will  be so to everlasting. Thirdly, that he changes not, neither is there  variableness with him, and that his course is one eternal round.  Fourthly, that he is a God of truth and cannot lie. Fifthly, that he  is no respecter of persons; and sixthly, that he is love. [§ III. ¶  12,13,14,15,16,17,18.]    Q. Where do you find the revelations which give us this idea of the  character of the Deity?    A. In the bible and book of commandments, and they are quoted in the  third lecture. [§ III. ¶ 9,10,11.]    Q. What effect would it have on any rational being not to have an idea  that the Lord was God, the Creator and upholder of all things?    A. It would prevent him from exercising faith in him unto life and  salvation.    Q. Why would it prevent him from exercising faith in God?    A. Because he would be as the heathen not knowing but there might be a  being greater and more powerful than he, and thereby he be prevented  from fulfilling his promises. [§ III. ¶ 19.]    Q. Does this idea prevent this doubt?    A. It does; for persons having this idea are enabled thereby to  exercise faith without this doubt. [§ III. ¶ 19.]    Q. Is it not also necessary to have the idea that God is merciful, and  gracious, long-suffering and full of goodness?    A. It is. [§ III. ¶ 20.]    Q. Why is it necessary?    A. Because of the weakness and imperfections of human nature, and the  great frailties of man; for such is the weakness of man, and such his  frailties, that he is liable to sin continually, and if God were not  long-suffering, and full of compassion, gracious and merciful and  of a forgiving disposition, man would be cut off from before him in  consequence of which, he would be in continual doubt and could not  exercise faith; for where doubt is, there faith has no power, but  by man's believing that God is full of compassion and forgiveness,  long-suffering and slow to anger, he can exercise faith in him and  overcome doubt, so as to be exceedingly strong. [§ III. ¶ 20.]    Q. Is it not equally as necessary that man should have an idea that  God changes not, neither is there variableness with him, in order to  exercise faith in him unto life and salvation?    A. It is; because without this, he would not know how soon the mercy  of God might change into cruelty, his long-suffering into rashness,  his love into hatred, and in consequence of which doubt man would be  incapable of exercising faith in him, but having the idea that he is  unchangeable, man can have faith in him continually, believing that,  what he was yesterday he is to-day, and will be forever. [§ III. ¶ 21.]    Q. Is it not necessary also, for men to have an idea that God is a  being of truth before they can have perfect faith in him?    A. It is; for unless men have this idea they cannot place confidence  in his word, and not being able to place confidence in his word, they  could not have faith in him; but believing that he is a God of truth,  and that his word cannot fail, their faith can rest in him without  doubt. [§ III. ¶ 22.]    Q. Could man exercise faith in God so as to obtain eternal life unless  he believed that God was no respecter of persons?    A. He could not; because without this idea he could not certainly know  that it was his privilege so to do, and in consequence of this doubt  his faith could not be sufficiently strong to save him. [§ III. ¶ 23.]    Q. Would it be possible for a man to exercise faith in God, so as to be  saved, unless he had an idea that God was love?    A. He could not; because man could not love God unless he had an idea  that God was love, and if he did not love God he could not have faith  in him. [§ III. ¶ 24.]    Q. What is the description which the sacred writers give of the  character of the Deity calculated to do?    A. It is calculated to lay a foundation for the exercise of faith  in him, as far as the knowledge extends among all people, tongues,  languages, kindreds and nations and that from age to age, and from  generation to generation. [§ III. ¶ 25.]    Q. Is the character which God has given of himself uniform?    A. It is, in all his revelations, whether to the Former Day Saints,  or to the Latter day saints, so that they all have the authority to  exercise faith in him, and to expect by the exercise of their faith, to  enjoy the same blessings. [§ III. ¶ 26.]        LECTURE FOURTH.    Of Faith.    SECTION IV.    1. Having shown in the third lecture, that correct ideas of the  character of God are necessary in order to the exercise of faith in  him unto life and salvation, and that without correct ideas of his  character, the minds of men could not have sufficient power with God  to the exercise of faith necessary to the enjoyment of eternal life,  and that correct ideas of his character lay a foundation as far as his  character is concerned, for the exercise of faith, so as to enjoy the  fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Jesus Christ, even that of  eternal glory; we shall now proceed to show the connection there is  between correct ideas of the attributes of God, and the exercise of  faith in him unto eternal life.    2. Let us here observe, that the real design which the God of heaven  had in view in making the human family acquainted with his attributes,  was, that they through the ideas of the existence of his attributes,  might be enabled to exercise faith in him, and through the exercise of  faith in him, might obtain eternal life. For without the idea of the  existence of the attributes which belong to God, the minds of men could  not have power to exercise faith in him so as to lay hold upon eternal  life. The God of heaven understanding most perfectly the constitution  of human nature, and the weakness of men, knew what was necessary to be  revealed, and what ideas must be planted in their minds in order that  they might be enabled to exercise faith in him unto eternal life.    3. Having said so much we shall proceed to examine the attributes of  God, as set forth in his revelations to the human family, and to show  how necessary correct ideas of his attributes are, to enable men to  exercise faith in him. For without these ideas being planted in the  minds of men it would be out of the power of any person or persons to  exercise faith in God so as to obtain eternal life. So that the divine  communications made to men in the first instance, were designed to  establish in their minds the ideas necessary to enable them to exercise  faith in God, and through this means to be partakers of his glory.    4. We have, in the revelations which he has given to the human family,  the following account of his attributes.    5. First, Knowledge. Acts 15:18. Known unto God are all his works from  the beginning of the world. Isaiah 46:9,10. Remember the former things  of old; for I am God and there is none else; I am God, and there is  none like me, _declaring the end from the beginning_, and from ancient  time the things that are not yet done, saying. My counsel shall stand,  and I will do all my pleasure.    6. Secondly, Faith, or power. Heb. 11:3. Through faith we understand  that the worlds were framed by the word of God. Gen. 1:1. In the  beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Isaiah 14:24,27. The  Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought so shall it  come to pass; and as I have purposed so shall it stand. For the Lord  of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is  stretched out, and who shall turn it back?    7. Thirdly, Justice. Psalm 89:14. Justice and judgment are the  habitation of thy throne. Isaiah 45:21. Tell ye, and bring them near;  yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from the  ancient time? Have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside me;  a just God and a Saviour. Zeph. 5:5. The just Lord is in the midst  thereof. Zech. 9:9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O  daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just,  and having salvation.    8. Fourthly, Judgment. Ps. 89:14. Justice and judgment are the  habitation of thy throne. Deut. 32:4. He is the Rock, his work is  perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without  iniquity: just and right is he. Ps. 9:7. But the Lord shall endure for  ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment. Ps. 9:16. The Lord is  known by the judgment which he executeth.    9. Fifthly, Mercy. Ps. 89:15. Mercy and truth shall go before his face.  Exodus 34:6. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The  Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious. Neh. 9:17.--But you art a  God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful.    10. And Sixthly, Truth. Ps. 89:14. Mercy "]]]
