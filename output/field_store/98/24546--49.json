'Have you ever dreamed that you were being chased up Broadway by a  chimpanzee in evening dress?'    'Never mind, dear, you'll be quite all right again when you have  been living this life down here a little longer.'    Nutty glared balefully at the ceiling.    'What's that darned thing up there on the ceiling? It looks like a  hornet. How on earth do these things get into the house?'    'We ought to have nettings. I am going to pounce on Mr Flack about  that too.'    'Thank goodness this isn't going to last much longer. It's nearly  two weeks since Uncle Ira died. We ought to be hearing from the  lawyers any day now. There might be a letter this morning.'    'Do you think he has left us his money?'    'Do I? Why, what else could he do with it? We are his only  surviving relatives, aren't we? I've had to go through life with a  ghastly name like Nutcombe as a compliment to him, haven't I? I  wrote to him regularly at Christmas and on his birthday, didn't I?  Well, then! I have a feeling there will be a letter from the  lawyers to-day. I wish you would get dressed and go down to the  post-office while I'm fetching that infernal water. I can't think  why the fools haven't cabled. You would have supposed they would  have thought of that.'    Elizabeth returned to her room to dress. She was conscious of a  feeling that nothing was quite perfect in this world. It would be  nice to have a great deal of money, for she had a scheme in her  mind which called for a large capital; but she was sorry that it  could come to her only through the death of her uncle, of whom,  despite his somewhat forbidding personality, she had always been  fond. She was also sorry that a large sum of money was coming to  Nutty at that particular point in his career, just when there  seemed the hope that the simple life might pull him together. She  knew Nutty too well not to be able to forecast his probable  behaviour under the influence of a sudden restoration of wealth.    While these thoughts were passing through her mind she happened to  glance out of the window. Nutty was shambling through the garden  with his pail, a bowed, shuffling pillar of gloom. As Elizabeth  watched, he dropped the pail and lashed the air violently for a  while. From her knowledge of bees ('It is needful to remember that  bees resent outside interference and will resolutely defend  themselves,' _Encyc. Brit._, Vol. III, AUS to BIS) Elizabeth  deduced that one of her little pets was annoying him. This episode  concluded, Nutty resumed his pail and the journey, and at this  moment there appeared over the hedge the face of Mr John Prescott,  a neighbour. Mr Prescott, who had dismounted from a bicycle,  called to Nutty and waved something in the air. To a stranger the  performance would have been obscure, but Elizabeth understood it.  Mr Prescott was intimating that he had been down to the post-office  for his own letters and, as was his neighbourly custom on these  occasions, had brought back also letters for Flack's.    Nutty foregathered with Mr Prescott and took the letters from him.  Mr Prescott disappeared. Nutty selected one of the letters and  opened it. Then, having stood perfectly still for some moments, he  suddenly turned and began to run towards the house.    The mere fact that her brother, whose usual mode of progression  was a languid saunter, should be actually running, was enough to  tell Elizabeth that the letter which Nutty had read was from the  London lawyers. No other communication could have galvanized him  into such energy. Whether the contents of the letter were good or  bad it was impossible at that distance to say. But when she  reached the open air, just as Nutty charged up, she saw by his  face that it was anguish not joy that had spurred him on. He was  gasping and he bubbled unintelligible words. His little eyes  gleamed wildly.    'Nutty, darling, what is it?' cried Elizabeth, every maternal  instinct in her aroused.    He was thrusting a sheet of paper at her, a sheet of paper that  bore the superscription of Nichols, Nichols, Nichols, and Nichols,  with a London address.    'Uncle Ira--' Nutty choked. 'Twenty pounds! He's left me twenty  pounds, and all the rest to a--to a man named Dawlish!'    In silence Elizabeth took the letter. It was even as he had said.  A few moments before Elizabeth had been regretting the imminent  descent of wealth upon her brother. Now she was inconsistent  enough to boil with rage at the shattering blow which had befallen  him. That she, too, had lost her inheritance hardly occurred to  her. Her thoughts were all for Nutty. It did not need the sight of  him, gasping and gurgling before her, to tell her how overwhelming  was his disappointment.    It was useless to be angry with the deceased Mr Nutcombe. He was  too shadowy a mark. Besides, he was dead. The whole current of her  wrath turned upon the supplanter, this Lord Dawlish. She pictured  him as a crafty adventurer, a wretched fortune-hunter. For some  reason or other she imagined him a sinister person with a black  moustache, a face thin and hawk-like, and unpleasant eyes. That  was the sort of man who would be likely to fasten his talons into  poor Uncle Ira.    She had never hated any one in her life before, but as she stood  there at that moment she felt that she loathed and detested  William Lord Dawlish--unhappy, well-meaning Bill, who only a few  hours back had set foot on American soil in his desire to nose  round and see if something couldn't be arranged.    Nutty fetched the water. Life is like that. There is nothing  clean-cut about it, no sense of form. Instead of being permitted  to concentrate his attention on his tragedy Nutty had to trudge  three-quarters of a mile, conciliate a bull-terrier, and trudge  back again carrying a heavy pail. It was as if one of the heroes  of Greek drama, in the middle of his big scene, had been asked to  run round the corner to a provision store.    The exercise did not act as a restorative. The blow had been too  sudden, too overwhelming. Nutty's reason--such as it was--tottered  on its throne. Who was Lord Dawlish? What had he done to  ingratiate himself with Uncle Ira? By what insidious means, with  what devilish cunning, had he wormed his way into the old man's  favour? These were the questions that vexed Nutty's mind when he  was able to think at all coherently.    Back at the farm Elizabeth cooked breakfast and awaited her  brother's return with a sinking heart. She was a soft-hearted  girl, easily distressed by the sight of suffering; and she was  aware that Nutty was scarcely of the type that masks its woes  behind a brave and cheerful smile. Her heart bled for Nutty.    There was a weary step outside. Nutty entered, slopping water. One  glance at his face was enough to tell Elizabeth that she had  formed a too conservative estimate of his probable gloom. Without  a word he coiled his long form in a chair. There was silence in  the stricken house.    'What's the time?'    Elizabeth glanced at her watch.    'Half-past nine.'    'About now,' said Nutty, sepulchrally, 'the blighter is ringing  for his man to prepare his bally bath and lay out his gold-leaf  underwear. After that he will drive down to the bank and draw some  of our money.'    The day passed wearily for Elizabeth. Nutty having the air of one  who is still engaged in picking up the pieces, she had not the  heart to ask him to play his customary part in the household  duties, so she washed the dishes and made the beds herself. After  that she attended to the bees. After that she cooked lunch.    Nutty was not chatty at lunch. Having observed 'About now the  blighter is cursing the waiter for bringing the wrong brand of  champagne,' he relapsed into a silence which he did not again  break.    Elizabeth was busy again in the afternoon. At four o'clock,  feeling tired out, she went to her room to lie down until the next  of her cycle of domestic duties should come round.    It was late when she came downstairs, for she had fallen asleep.  The sun had gone down. Bees were winging their way heavily back to  the hives with their honey. She went out into the grounds to try  to find Nutty. There had been no signs of him in the house. There  were no signs of him about the grounds. It was not like him to  have taken a walk, but it seemed the only possibility. She went  back to the house to wait. Eight o'clock came, and nine, and it  was then the truth dawned upon her--Nutty had escaped. He had  slipped away and gone up to New York.          6      Lord Dawlish sat in the New York flat which had been lent him by  his friend Gates. The hour was half-past ten in the evening; the  day, the second day after the exodus of Nutty Boyd from the farm.  Before him on the table lay a letter. He was smoking pensively.    Lord Dawlish had found New York enjoyable, but a trifle fatiguing.  There was much to be seen in the city, and he had made the mistake  of trying to see it all at once. It had been his intention, when  he came home after dinner that night, to try to restore the  balance of things by going to bed early. He had sat up longer than  he had intended, because he had been thinking about this letter.    Immediately upon his arrival in America, Bill had sought out a  lawyer and instructed him to write to Elizabeth Boyd, offering her  one-half of the late Ira Nutcombe's money. He had had time during  the voyage to think the whole matter over, and this seemed to him  the only possible course. He could not keep it all. He would feel  like the despoiler of the widow and the orphan. Nor would it be  fair to Claire to give it all up. If he halved the legacy  everybody would be satisfied.    That at least had been his view until Elizabeth's reply had  arrived. It was this reply that lay on the table--a brief, formal  note, setting forth Miss Boyd's absolute refusal to accept any  portion of the money. This was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#8)"],[1," turbans are very like  the Bhillis', but who wear long hair down to their waists; and hundreds  of other tribes.    Proposing to count how many different headgears are to be seen in Bombay  alone, we had to abandon the task as impracticable after a fortnight.  Every caste, every trade, guild, and sect, every one of the thousand  sub-divisions of the social hierarchy, has its own bright turban, often  sparkling with gold lace and precious stones, which is laid aside only  in case of mourning. But, as if to compensate for this luxury, even the  mem-bers of the municipality, rich merchants, and Rai-Bahadurs, who have  been created baronets by the Government, never wear any stockings, and  leave their legs bare up to the knees. As for their dress, it chiefly  consists of a kind of shapeless white shirt.    In Baroda some Gaikwars (a title of all the Baroda princes) still keep  in their stables elephants and the less common giraffes, though the  former are strictly forbidden in the streets of Bombay. We had an  opportunity of seeing ministers, and even Rajas, mounted on these noble  animals, their mouths full of pansupari (betel leaves), their heads  drooping under the weight of the precious stones on their turbans, and  each of their fingers and toes adorned with rich golden rings. While  the evening I am describing lasted, however, we saw no elephants, no  giraffes, though we enjoyed the company of Rajas and ministers. We had  in our box the hand-some ambassador and late tutor of the Mahararana  of Oodeypore. Our companion was a Raja and a pandit. His name was a  Mohunlal-Vishnulal-Pandia. He wore a small pink turban sparkling with  diamonds, a pair of pink barege trousers, and a white gauze coat.  His raven black hair half covered his amber-colored neck, which was  surrounded by a necklace that might have driven any Parisian belle  frantic with envy. The poor Raiput was awfully sleepy, but he stuck  heroically to his duties, and, thoughtfully pulling his beard, led us  all through the endless labyrinth of metaphysical entanglements of the  Ramayana. During the entr'actes we were offered coffee, sherbets, and  cigarettes, which we smoked even during the performance, sitting in  front of the stage in the first row. We were covered, like idols, with  garlands of flowers, and the manager, a stout Hindu clad in transparent  muslins, sprinkled us several times with rose-water.    The performance began at eight p.m. and, at half-past two, had only  reached the ninth act. In spite of each of us having a punkah-wallah  at our backs, the heat was unbearable. We had reached the limits of  our endurance, and tried to excuse ourselves. This led to general  disturbance, on the stage as well as in the auditorium. The airy  chariot, on which the wicked king Ravana was carrying Sita away, paused  in the air. The king of the Nagas (serpents) ceased breathing flames,  the monkey soldiers hung motionless on the trees, and Rama himself, clad  in light blue and crowned with a diminutive pagoda, came to the front of  the stage and pronounced in pure English speech, in which he thanked  us for the honour of our presence. Then new bouquets, pansu-paris, and  rose-water, and, finally, we reached home about four a.m. Next morning  we learned that the performance had ended at half-past six.          On The Way To Karli        It is an early morning near the end of March. A light breeze caresses  with its velvety hand the sleepy faces of the pilgrims; and the  intoxicating perfume of tuberoses mingles with the pungent odors of the  bazaar. Crowds of barefooted Brahman women, stately and well-formed,  direct their steps, like the biblical Rachel, to the well, with brass  water pots bright as gold upon their heads. On our way lie numerous  sacred tanks, filled with stagnant water, in which Hindus of both sexes  perform their prescribed morning ablutions. Under the hedge of a garden  somebody's tame mongoose is devouring the head of a cobra. The headless  body of the snake convulsively, but harmlessly, beats against the thin  flanks of the little animal, which regards these vain efforts with an  evident delight. Side by side with this group of animals is a human  figure; a naked mali (gardener), offering betel and salt to a monstrous  stone idol of Shiva, with the view of pacifying the wrath of the  \"Destroyer,\" excited by the death of the cobra, which is one of his  favourite servants. A few steps before reaching the railway station, we  meet a modest Catholic procession, consisting of a few newly converted  pariahs and some of the native Portuguese. Under a baldachin is a  litter, on which swings to and fro a dusky Madonna dressed after the  fashion of the native goddesses, with a ring in her nose. In her arms  she carries the holy Babe, clad in yellow pyjamas and a red Brah-manical  turban. \"Hari, hari, devaki!\" (\"Glory to the holy Virgin!\") exclaim the  converts, unconscious of any difference between the Devaki, mother of  Krishna, and the Catholic Madonna. All they know is that, excluded from  the temples by the Brahmans on account of their not belonging to any  of the Hindu castes, they are admitted sometimes into the Christian  pagodas, thanks to the \"padris,\" a name adopted from the Portuguese  padre, and applied indiscriminately to the missionaries of every  European sect.    At last, our gharis--native two-wheeled vehicles drawn by a pair of  strong bullocks--arrived at the station. English employes open wide  their eyes at the sight of white-faced people travelling about the town  in gilded Hindu chariots. But we are true Americans, and we have come  hither to study, not Europe, but India and her products on the spot.    If the tourist casts a glance on the shore opposite to the port of  Bombay, he will see a dark blue mass rising like a wall between himself  and the horizon. This is Parbul, a flat-topped mountain 2,250 feet high.  Its right slope leans on two sharp rocks covered with woods. The highest  of them, Mataran, is the object of our trip. From Bombay to Narel, a  station situated at the foot of this mountain, we are to travel four  hours by railway, though, as the crow flies, the distance is not more  than twelve miles. The railroad wanders round the foot of the most  charming little hills, skirts hundreds of pretty lakes, and pierces with  more than twenty tunnels the very heart of the rocky ghats.    We were accompanied by three Hindu friends. Two of them once belonged to  a high caste, but were excommunicated from their pagoda for association  and friendship with us, unworthy foreigners. At the station our party  was joined by two more natives, with whom we had been in correspondence  for many a year. All were members of our Society, reformers of the Young  India school, enemies of Brahmans, castes, aid prejudices, and were to  be our fellow-travelers and visit with us the annual fair at the temple  festivities of Karli, stopping on the way at Mataran and Khanduli.  One was a Brahman from Poona, the second a moodeliar (landowner)  from Madras, the third a Singalese from Kegalla, the fourth a Bengali  Zemindar, and the fifth a gigantic Rajput, whom we had known for a long  time by the name of Gulab-Lal-Sing, and had called simply Gulab-Sing. I  shall dwell upon his personality more than on any of the others, because  the most wonderful and diverse stories were in circulation about this  strange man. It was asserted that he belonged to the sect of Raj-Yogis,  and was an initiate of the mysteries of magic, alchemy, and various  other occult sciences of India. He was rich and independent, and rumour  did not dare to suspect him of deception, the more so because, though  quite full of these sciences, he never uttered a word about them in  public, and carefully concealed his knowledge from all except a few  friends.    He was an independent Takur from Rajistan, a province the name of which  means the land of kings. Takurs are, almost without exception, descended  from the Surya (sun), and are accordingly called Suryavansa. They are  prouder than any other nation in the world. They have a proverb, \"The  dirt of the earth cannot stick to the rays of the sun.\" They do not  despise any sect, except the Brahmans, and honor only the bards who sing  their military achievements. Of the latter Colonel Tod writes somewhat  as follows,* \"The magnificence and luxury of the Rajput courts in the  early periods of history were truly wonderful, even when due allowance  is made for the poetical license of the bards. From the earliest times  Northern India was a wealthy country, and it was precisely here that  was situated the richest satrapy of Darius. At all events, this country  abounded in those most striking events which furnish history with her  richest materials. In Rajistan every small kingdom had its Thermopylae,  and every little town has produced its Leonidas. But the veil of the  centuries hides from posterity events that the pen of the historian  might have bequeathed to the everlasting admiration of the nations.  Somnath might have appeared as a rival of Delphi, the treasures of Hind  might outweigh the riches of the King of Lydia, while compared with the  army of the brothers Pandu, that of Xerxes would seem an inconsiderable  handful of men, worthy only to rank in the second place.\"      * In nearly every instance the passages quoted from various authorities  have been retranslated from the Russian. As the time and labor needful  for verification would he too great, the sense only of these passages is  given here. They do not pretend to be textual.--Translator      England did not disarm the Rajputs, as she did the rest of the Indian  nations, so Gulab-Sing came accompanied by vassals and shield-bearers.    Possessing an inexhaustible knowledge of legends, and being evidently  well acquainted with the antiquities of his country, Gulab-Sing proved  to be the most interesting of our companions.    \"There, against the blue sky,\""]]]
