What can anyone say against  Saevius Nicanor?--ah, what indeed?\" demanded Jurgen.    And he wondered if there might not have been perchance some such  persons somewhere, after all. Their names, in any event, sounded  very plausible to Jurgen.    \"Ah, dearie, I was never one for learning. It may be as you say.\"    \"You say 'it may be', godmother. That embarrasses me, rather,  because I was about to ask for my christening gift, which in the  press of other matters you overlooked some forty years back. You  will readily conceive that your negligence, however unintentional,  might possibly give rise to unkindly criticism: and so I felt I  ought to mention it, in common fairness to you.\"    \"As for that, dearie, ask what you will within the limits of my  power. For mine are all the sapphires and turquoises and whatever  else in this dusty world is blue; and mine likewise are all the  Wednesdays that have ever been or ever will be: and any one of these  will I freely give you in return for your fine speeches and your  tender heart.\"    \"Ah, but, godmother, would it be quite just for you to accord me so  much more than is granted to other persons?\"    \"Why, no: but what have I to do with justice? I bleach. Come now,  then, do you make a choice! for I can assure you that my sapphires  are of the first water, and that many of my oncoming Wednesdays will  be well worth seeing.\"    \"No, godmother, I never greatly cared for jewelry: and the future is  but dressing and undressing, and shaving, and eating, and computing  percentage, and so on; the future does not interest me now. So I  shall modestly content myself with a second-hand Wednesday, with one  that you have used and have no further need of: and it will be a  Wednesday in the August of such and such a year.\"    Mother Sereda agreed to this. \"But there are certain rules to be  observed,\" says she, \"for one must have system.\"    As she spoke, she undid the towel about her head, and she took a  blue comb from her white hair: and she showed Jurgen what was  engraved on the comb. It frightened Jurgen, a little: but he nodded  assent.    \"First, though,\" says Mother Sereda, \"here is the blue bird. Would  you not rather have that, dearie, than your Wednesday? Most people  would.\"    \"Ah, but, godmother,\" he replied, \"I am Jurgen. No, it is not the  blue bird I desire.\"    So Mother Sereda took from the wall the wicker cage containing the  three white pigeons: and going before him, with small hunched shoulders,  and shuffling her feet along the flagstones, she led the way into a  courtyard, where, sure enough, they found a tethered he-goat. Of a  dark blue color this beast was, and his eyes were wiser than the eyes  of a beast.    Then Jurgen set about that which Mother Sereda said was necessary.          7.    Of Compromises on a Wednesday      So it was that, riding upon a horse whose bridle was marked with a  coronet, the pawnbroker returned to a place, and to a moment, which  he remembered. It was rather queer to be a fine young fellow again,  and to foresee all that was to happen for the next twenty years.    As it chanced, the first person he encountered was his mother Azra,  whom Coth had loved very greatly but not long. And Jurgen talked  with Azra of what clothes he would be likely to need in Gatinais,  and of how often he would write to her. She disparaged the new shirt  he was wearing, as was to be expected, since Azra had always  preferred to select her son's clothing rather than trust to Jurgen's  taste. His new horse she admitted to be a handsome animal; and only  hoped he had not stolen it from anybody who would get him into  trouble. For Azra, it must be recorded, had never any confidence in  her son; and was the only woman, Jurgen felt, who really understood  him.    And now as his beautiful young mother impartially petted and snapped  at him, poor Jurgen thought of that very real dissension and  severance which in the oncoming years was to arise between them; and  of how she would die without his knowing of her death for two whole  months; and of how his life thereafter would be changed, somehow,  and the world would become an unstable place in which you could no  longer put cordial faith. And he foreknew all the remorse he was to  shrug away, after the squandering of so much pride and love. But  these things were not yet: and besides, these things were  inevitable.    \"And yet that these things should be inevitable is decidedly not  fair,\" said Jurgen.    So it was with all the persons he encountered. The people whom he  loved when at his best as a fine young fellow were so very soon, and  through petty causes, to become nothing to him, and he himself was  to be converted into a commonplace tradesman. And living seemed to  Jurgen a wasteful and inequitable process.    Then Jurgen left the home of his youth, and rode toward Bellegarde,  and tethered his horse upon the heath, and went into the castle.  Thus Jurgen came to Dorothy. She was lovely and dear, and yet, by  some odd turn, not quite so lovely and dear as the Dorothy he had  seen in the garden between dawn and sunrise. And Dorothy, like  everybody else, praised Jurgen's wonderful new shirt.    \"It is designed for such festivals,\" said Jurgen, modestly--\"a  little notion of my own. A bit extreme, some persons might consider  it, but there is no pleasing everybody. And I like a trifle of  color.\"    For there was a masque that night at the castle of Bellegarde: and  wildly droll and sad it was to Jurgen to remember what was to befall  so many of the participants.    Jurgen had not forgotten this Wednesday, this ancient Wednesday upon  which Messire de Montors had brought the Confraternity of St. Medard  from Brunbelois, to enact a masque of The Birth of Hercules, as the  vagabonds were now doing, to hilarious applause. Jurgen remembered  it was the day before Bellegarde discovered that Count Emmerick's  guest, the Vicomte de Puysange, was in reality the notorious outlaw,  Perion de la Foret. Well, yonder the yet undetected impostor was  talking very earnestly with Dame Melicent: and Jurgen knew all that  was in store for this pair of lovers.    Meanwhile, as Jurgen reflected, the real Vicomte de Puysange was at  this moment lying in a delirium, yonder at Benoit's: to-morrow the  true Vicomte would be recognized, and within the year the Vicomte  would have married Felise de Soyecourt, and later Jurgen would meet  her, in the orchard; and Jurgen knew what was to happen then also.    And Messire de Montors was watching Dame Melicent, sidewise, while  he joked with little Ettarre, who was this night permitted to stay  up later than usual, in honor of the masque: and Jurgen knew that  this young bishop was to become Pope of Rome, no less; and that the  child he joked with was to become the woman for possession of whom  Guiron des Rocques and the surly-looking small boy yonder, Maugis  d'Aigremont, would contend with each other until the country  hereabouts had been devastated, and the castle wherein Jurgen now  was had been besieged, and this part of it burned. And wildly droll  and sad it was to Jurgen thus to remember all that was going to  happen to these persons, and to all the other persons who were  frolicking in the shadow of their doom and laughing at this trivial  masque.    For here--with so much of ruin and failure impending, and with  sorrow prepared so soon to smite a many of these revellers in ways  foreknown to Jurgen; and with death resistlessly approaching so  soon to make an end of almost all this company in some unlovely  fashion that Jurgen foreknew exactly,--here laughter seemed  unreasonable and ghastly. Why, but Reinault yonder, who laughed so  loud, with his cropped head flung back: would Reinault be laughing  in quite this manner if he knew the round strong throat he thus  exposed was going to be cut like the throat of a calf, while three  Burgundians held him? Jurgen knew this thing was to befall Reinault  Vinsauf before October was out. So he looked at Reinault's throat,  and shudderingly drew in his breath between set teeth.    \"And he is worth a score of me, this boy!\" thought Jurgen: \"and it  is I who am going to live to be an old fellow, with my bit of land  in fee, years after dirt clogs those bright generous eyes, and years  after this fine big-hearted boy is wasted! And I shall forget all  about him, too. Marion l'Edol, that very pretty girl behind him, is  to become a blotched and toothless haunter of alleys, a leering  plucker at men's sleeves! And blue-eyed Colin here, with his baby  mouth, is to be hanged for that matter of coin-clipping--let me  recall, now,--yes, within six years of to-night! Well, but in a way,  these people are blessed in lacking foresight. For they laugh, and I  cannot laugh, and to me their laughter is more terrible than  weeping. Yes, they may be very wise in not glooming over what is  inevitable; and certainly I cannot go so far as to say they are  wrong: but still, at the same time--! And assuredly, living seems to  me in everything a wasteful and inequitable process.\"    Thus Jurgen, while the others passed a very pleasant evening.    And presently, when the masque was over, Dorothy and Jurgen went out  upon the terrace, to the east of Bellegarde, and so came to an  unforgotten world of moonlight. They sat upon a bench of carved  stone near the balustrade which overlooked the highway: and the boy  and the girl gazed wistfully beyond the highway, over luminous  valleys and tree-tops. Just so they had sat there, as Jurgen  perfectly remembered, when Mother Sereda first used this Wednesday.    \"My Heart's Desire,\" says Jurgen, \"I am sad to-night. For I am  thinking of what life will do to us, and what offal the years will  make of you and me.\"    \"My own sweetheart,\" says she, \"and do we not know very well what is  to happen?\" And Dorothy began to talk"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell. (#8)"],[1,"The border of the crimson-seething flood,  Whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.    Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow  Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:  \"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given  To blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud  Their merciless wrongs.  Here Alexander dwells,  And Dionysius fell, who many a year  Of woe wrought for fair Sicily.  That brow  Whereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,  Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks  Obizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd  By his foul step-son.\"  To the bard rever'd  I turned me round, and thus he spake; \"Let him  Be to thee now first leader, me but next  To him in rank.\"  Then farther on a space  The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat  Were extant from the wave; and showing us  A spirit by itself apart retir'd,  Exclaim'd: \"He in God's bosom smote the heart,  Which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames.\"    A race I next espied, who held the head,  And even all the bust above the stream.  'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.  Thus shallow more and more the blood became,  So that at last it but imbru'd the feet;  And there our passage lay athwart the foss.    \"As ever on this side the boiling wave  Thou seest diminishing,\" the Centaur said,  \"So on the other, be thou well assur'd,  It lower still and lower sinks its bed,  Till in that part it reuniting join,  Where 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.  There Heav'n's stern justice lays chastising hand  On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,  On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts  Tears ever by the seething flood unlock'd  From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,  Pazzo the other nam'd, who fill'd the ways  With violence and war.\"  This said, he turn'd,  And quitting us, alone repass'd the ford.          CANTO XIII    ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,  We enter'd on a forest, where no track  Of steps had worn a way.  Not verdant there  The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light  The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd  And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns  Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,  Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide  Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,  Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.    Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same  Who from the Strophades the Trojan band  Drove with dire boding of their future woe.  Broad are their pennons, of the human form  Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen  The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings  These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.    The kind instructor in these words began:  \"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now  I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come  Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well  Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,  As would my speech discredit.\"  On all sides  I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see  From whom they might have issu'd.  In amaze  Fast bound I stood.  He, as it seem'd, believ'd,  That I had thought so many voices came  From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,  And thus his speech resum'd: \"If thou lop off  A single twig from one of those ill plants,  The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite.\"    Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,  From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,  And straight the trunk exclaim'd: \"Why pluck'st thou me?\"    Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,  These words it added: \"Wherefore tear'st me thus?  Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?  Men once were we, that now are rooted here.  Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been  The souls of serpents.\"  As a brand yet green,  That burning at one end from the other sends  A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind  That forces out its way, so burst at once,  Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.    I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one  Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:  \"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd  What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,  He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.  But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,  Prompted him to this deed, which even now  Myself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;  That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,  In the upper world (for thither to return  Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.\"    \"That pleasant word of thine,\" the trunk replied  \"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech  Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge  A little longer, in the snare detain'd,  Count it not grievous.  I it was, who held  Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,  Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,  That besides me, into his inmost breast  Scarce any other could admittance find.  The faith I bore to my high charge was such,  It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.  The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes  From Caesar's household, common vice and pest  Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;  And to Augustus they so spread the flame,  That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.  My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought  Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,  Just as I was, unjust toward myself.  By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,  That never faith I broke to my liege lord,  Who merited such honour; and of you,  If any to the world indeed return,  Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies  Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow.\"    First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words  Were ended, then to me the bard began:  \"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,  If more thou wish to learn.\"  Whence I replied:  \"Question thou him again of whatsoe'er  Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power  Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart.\"    He thus resum'd; \"So may he do for thee  Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet  Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,  How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;  And whether any ever from such frame  Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell.\"    Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon  Chang'd into sounds articulate like these;    \"Briefly ye shall be answer'd.  When departs  The fierce soul from the body, by itself  Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf  By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,  No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance  Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,  It rises to a sapling, growing thence  A savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves  Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain  A vent to grief.  We, as the rest, shall come  For our own spoils, yet not so that with them  We may again be clad; for what a man  Takes from himself it is not just he have.  Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout  The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,  Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.\"    Attentive yet to listen to the trunk  We stood, expecting farther speech, when us  A noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives  The wild boar and the hunt approach his place  Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs  Loud rustling round him hears.  And lo! there came  Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,  That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.  \"Haste now,\" the foremost cried, \"now haste thee death!\"    The other, as seem'd, impatient of delay  Exclaiming, \"Lano! not so bent for speed  Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field.\"  And then, for that perchance no longer breath  Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush  One group he made.  Behind them was the wood  Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,  As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.  On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,  And having rent him piecemeal bore away  The tortur'd limbs.  My guide then seiz'd my hand,  And led me to the thicket, which in vain  Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: \"O Giacomo  Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,\"  It cried, \"that of me thou hast made thy screen?  For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?\"    When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:  \"Say who wast thou, that at so many points  Breath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?\"    He answer'd: \"Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in time  To spy the shameful havoc, that from me  My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,  And at the foot of their sad parent-tree  Carefully lay them.  In that city' I dwelt,  Who for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,  Whence he for this shall cease not with his art  To work her woe: and if there still remain'd not  On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,  Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls  Upon the ashes left by Attila,  Had labour'd without profit of their toil.  I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.\"          CANTO XIV    SOON as the charity of native land  Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves  Collected, and to him restor'd, who now  Was hoarse with utt'rance.  To the limit thence  We came, which from the third the second round  Divides, and where of justice is display'd  Contrivance horrible.  Things then first seen  Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next  A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed  Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round  Its garland on all sides, as round the wood  Spreads the sad foss.  There, on the very edge,  Our steps we stay'd.  It was an area wide  Of arid sand and thick, resembling most  The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.    Vengeance of Heav'n!  Oh! how shouldst thou be fear'd  By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!    Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,  All weeping piteously, to different laws  Subjected: for on the earth some lay supine,  Some crouching close were seated, others pac'd  Incessantly around; the latter tribe,  More numerous, those fewer who beneath  The torment lay, but louder in their grief.    O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down  Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow  On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd.  As in "]]]
