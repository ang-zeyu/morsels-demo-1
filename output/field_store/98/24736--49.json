THYONICHUS.              Missed me! Why what ails him now?        AESCHINES.      My friend, I am ill at ease.        THYONICHUS.                  Then this explains      Thy leanness, and thy prodigal moustache      And dried-up curls. Thy counterpart I saw,      A wan Pythagorean, yesterday.      He said he came from Athens: shoes he had none:      He pined, I'll warrant,--for a quartern loaf.        AESCHINES.      Sir, you will joke--But I've been outraged, sore,      And by Cynisca. I shall go stark mad      Ere you suspect--a hair would turn the scale.        THYONICHUS.      Such thou wert always, AEschines my friend.      In lazy mood or trenchant, at thy whim      The world must wag. But what's thy grievance now?        AESCHINES.      That Argive, Apis the Thessalian Knight,      Myself, and gallant Cleonicus, supped      Within my grounds. Two pullets I had slain,      And a prime pig: and broached my Biblian wine;      'Twas four years old, but fragrant as when new.      Truffles were served to us: and the drink was good.      Well, we got on, and each must drain a cup      To whom he fancied; only each must name.      We named, and took our liquor as ordained;      But she sate silent--this before my face.      Fancy my feelings! \"Wilt not speak? Hast seen      A wolf?\" some wag said. \"Shrewdly guessed,\" quoth she,      And blushed--her blushes might have fired a torch.      A wolf _had_ charmed her: Wolf her neighbour's son,      Goodly and tall, and fair in divers eyes:      For his illustrious sake it was she pined.      This had been breathed, just idly, in my ear:      Shame on my beard, I ne'er pursued the hint.      Well, when we four were deep amid our cups,      The Knight must sing 'The Wolf' (a local song)      Right through for mischief. All at once she wept      Hot tears as girls of six years old might weep,      Clinging and clamouring round their mother's lap.      And I, (you know my humour, friend of mine,)      Drove at his face, one, two! She gathered up      Her robes and vanished straightway through the door.      \"And so I fail to please, false lady mine?      Another lies more welcome in thy lap?      Go warm that other's heart: he'll say thy tears      Are liquid pearls.\" And as a swallow flies      Forth in a hurry, here or there to find      A mouthful for her brood among the eaves:      From her soft sofa passing-swift she fled      Through folding-doors and hall, with random feet:      _'The stag had gained his heath':_ you know the rest.      Three weeks, a month, nine days and ten to that,      To-day's the eleventh: and 'tis just two months      All but two days, since she and I were two.      Hence is my beard of more than Thracian growth.      Now Wolf is all to her: Wolf enters in      At midnight; I am a cypher in her eyes;      The poor Megarian, nowhere in the race.      All would go right, if I could once _unlove_:      But now, you wot, the rat hath tasted tar.      And what may cure a swain at his wit's end      I know not: Simus, (true,) a mate of mine,      Loved Epichalcus' daughter, and took ship      And came home cured. I too will sail the seas.      Worse men, it may be better, are afloat,      I shall still prove an average man-at-arms.        THYONICHUS.      Now may thy love run smoothly, AEschines!      But should'st thou really mean a voyage out,      The freeman's best paymaster's Ptolemy.        AESCHINES.      What is he else?        THYONICHUS.              A gentleman: a man      Of wit and taste; the top of company;      Loyal to ladies; one whose eye is keen      For friends, and keener still for enemies.      Large in his bounties, he, in kingly sort,      Denies a boon to none: but, AEschines,      One should not ask too often. This premised,      If thou wilt clasp the military cloak      O'er thy right shoulder, and with legs astride      Await the onward rush of shielded men:      Hie thee to Egypt. Age overtakes us all;      Our temples first; then on o'er cheek and chin,      Slowly and surely, creep the frosts of Time.      Up and do somewhat, ere thy limbs are sere.          IDYLL XV.      The Festival of Adonis.    _GORGO. PRAXINOAe._        GORGO.      Praxinoae in?        PRAXINOAe.            Yes, Gorgo dear! At last!      That you're here now's a marvel! See to a chair,      A cushion, Eunoae!        GORGO.                I lack naught.        PRAXINOAe.                                Sit down.        GORGO.      Oh, what a thing is spirit! Here I am,      Praxinoae, safe at last from all that crowd      And all those chariots--every street a mass      Of boots and uniforms! And the road, my dear,      Seemed endless--you live now so far away!        PRAXINOAe.      This land's-end den--I cannot call it house--      My madcap hired to keep us twain apart      And stir up strife. 'Twas like him, odious pest!        GORGO.      Nay call not, dear, your lord, your Deinon, names      To the babe's face. Look how it stares at you!      There, baby dear, she never meant Papa!      It understands, by'r lady! Dear Papa!        PRAXINOAe.      Well, yesterday (that means what day you like)      'Papa' had rouge and hair-powder to buy;      He brought back salt! this oaf of six-foot-one!        GORGO.      Just such another is that pickpocket      My Diocleides. He bought t'other day      Six fleeces at seven drachms, his last exploit.      What were they? scraps of worn-out pedlar's-bags,      Sheer trash.--But put your cloak and mantle on;      And we'll to Ptolemy's, the sumptuous king,      To see the _Adonis_. As I hear, the queen      Provides us something gorgeous.        PRAXINOAe.                                Ay, the grand      Can do things grandly.        GORGO.                    When you've seen yourself,      What tales you'll have to tell to those who've not.      'Twere time we started!        PRAXINOAe.                          All time's holiday      With idlers! Eunoae, pampered minx, the jug!      Set it down here--you cats would sleep all day      On cushions--Stir yourself, fetch water, quick!      Water's our first want. How she holds the jug!      Now, pour--not, cormorant, in that wasteful way--      You've drenched my dress, bad luck t'you! There, enough:      I have made such toilet as my fates allowed.      Now for the key o' the plate-chest. Bring it, quick!        GORGO.      My dear, that full pelisse becomes you well.      What did it stand you in, straight off the loom?        PRAXINOAe.      Don't ask me, Gorgo: two good pounds and more.      Then I gave all my mind to trimming it.        GORGO.      Well, 'tis a great success.        PRAXINOAe.                                I think it is.      My mantle, Eunoae, and my parasol!      Arrange me nicely. Babe, you'll bide at home!      Horses would bite you--Boo!--Yes, cry your fill,      But we won't have you maimed. Now let's be off.      You, Phrygia, take and nurse the tiny thing:      Call the dog in: make fast the outer door!                                            [_Exeunt_.        Gods! what a crowd! How, when shall we get past      This nuisance, these unending ant-like swarms?      Yet, Ptolemy, we owe thee thanks for much      Since heaven received thy sire! No miscreant now      Creeps Thug-like up, to maul the passer-by.      What games men played erewhile--men shaped in crime,      Birds of a feather, rascals every one!      --We're done for, Gorgo darling--here they are,      The Royal horse! Sweet sir, don't trample me!      That bay--the savage!--reared up straight on end!      Fly, Eunoae, can't you? Doggedly she stands.      He'll be his rider's death!--How glad I am      My babe's at home.        GORGO.                      Praxinoae, never mind!      See, we're before them now, and they're in line.        PRAXINOAe.      There, I'm myself. But from a child I feared      Horses, and slimy snakes. But haste we on:      A surging multitude is close behind.        GORGO [_to Old Lady_].      From the palace, mother?        OLD LADY.                          Ay, child.        GORGO.                                Is it fair      Of access?        OLD LADY.                  Trying brought the Greeks to Troy.      Young ladies, they must try who would succeed.        GORGO.      The crone hath said her oracle and gone.      Women know all--how Adam married Eve.      --Praxinoae, look what crowds are round the door!        PRAXINOAe.      Fearful! Your hand, please, Gorgo. Eunoae, you      Hold Eutychis--hold tight or you'll be lost.      We'll enter in a body--hold us fast!      Oh dear, my muslin dress is torn in two,      Gorgo, already! Pray, good gentleman,      (And happiness be yours) respect my robe!        STRANGER.      I could not if I would--nathless I will.        PRAXINOAe.      They come in hundreds, and they push like swine.        STRANGER.      Lady, take courage: it is all well now.        PRAXINOAe.      And now and ever be it well with thee,      Sweet man, for shielding us! An honest soul      And kindly. Oh! they're smothering Eunoae:      Push, coward! That's right! 'All in,' the bridegroom said      And locked the door upon himself and bride.        GORGO.      Praxinoae, look! Note well this broidery first.      How exquisitely fine--too good for earth!      Empress Athene, what strange sempstress wrought      Such work? What painter painted, realized      Such pictures? Just like life they stand or move,      Facts and not fancies! What a thing is man!      How bright, how lifelike on his silvern couch      Lies, with youth's bloom scarce shadowing his cheek,      That dear Adonis, lovely e'en in death!        A STRANGER.      Bad luck t'you, cease your senseless pigeon's prate!      Their brogue is killing--every word a drawl!        GORGO.      Where did he spring from? Is our prattle aught      To you, Sir?

The distance of 16-1/2 miles was performed by one of them  going in an hour and thirteen minutes, returning (laden both ways) in an  hour and eight minutes. The last mile was done in three minutes.    _Blacking._--Shoes, among the classical ancients, were cleaned by a  sponge; in the middle ages, by washing. Oil, soap, and grease were the  substitutes for blacking, which was at first made with soot, but shone  with a gloss.    _Cool Tankard._--The custom of the Lord Mayor drinking a \"cool  tankard\" with the governor of Newgate, on his Lordship's way to proclaim  Bartholomew Fair, is better known to our readers than the precise contents  of the said tankard. In olden times the \"cool tankard\" was, or nearly  coincided with, the wine mixed with _Burrage_, (so the translators  call the herb) of Plutarch, and the _Herbosum Vinum_ of Du Cange. In  all probability, the \"cool tankard\" of our times implies a well-appointed  _dejeune a la fourchette_.    _Hanging_--though as a punishment for thieves, ascribed to the reign of  Henry I., occurs in a charter of Edgar. In hanging for public spectacle,  an iron hoop with a strong chain was put round the body; but the chain  was longer than the halter, so that when the latter was cut, the hoop  slipped to the armpits, and left them suspended. When criminals escaped,  an image of them was often hung up for several days; whence our hanging  in effigy.    _Elections._--Bribery, treating, canvassing, processions of voters at  the heels of the candidate, dancing attendance after the great, forming  factions, and other electioneering arts, occur in the classic ages.  Among us, the candidates were not always present at the day of election,  and under-sheriffs observe, that they mean to return according to the  number of votes, _provided the sheriff does not direct otherwise_. Lord  Chancellor Jefferies went to Arundel on purpose to overawe the electors.  The seats were as much sought formerly as now. The members received  wages as low as Elizabeth's reign.    _Lucretius._--A summary of that part of the system of Lucretius, in  which he describes man emerging from barbarity, acquiring the use of  language, and the knowledge of various useful and polite arts, is  comprised in a few lines of a satire of Horace, lib. i. sat. iii. v. 97.  It has been ingeniously paraphrased by Dr. Beattie:        \"When men out of the earth of old,    A dumb and beastly vermin crawled,    For acorns first and holes of shelter,    They tooth and nail and helter-skelter,    Fought fist to fist; then with a club,    Each learned his brother brute to drub;    Till more experienced grown, these cattle    Forged fit accoutrements for battle.    At last (Lucretius says, and Creech)    They set their wits to work on speech;    And that their thoughts might all have marks    To make them known, these learned clerks    Left off the trade of cracking crowns,    And manufactured verbs and nouns.\"    H.H.      Every trade has its technicalities. The other day we overheard a  lamplighter complain of a cunning fellow workman who tried to get all  the _straightforward_ work himself, and to leave the _turnings_ to  others.    _A Physician's Advice to his Student._      \"Dum aeger ait--Ah! ah!
