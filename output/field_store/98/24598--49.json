The \"Eternal\" is no longer the national God of Israel,  belonging to him exclusively; He becomes the God of the whole of  mankind, the same _Elohim_, Creator and Preserver of the world,  whom the Patriarchs had worshiped, and to whom, being His creatures,  all men owe worship. His precepts and His laws of morality are binding  upon all nations; they will bring salvation and blessing to all  without distinction.[11] The ideal of piety consists in the profession  of God and a life of rectitude. The time will come when all nations  will be penetrated by true knowledge of God and actuated by the  noblest motives; then will follow the universal brotherhood of man.  Until this consummation is reached, and so long as Israel is the only  nation formally professing the one true God, and accepting His blessed  law, Israel's sole task is to embody in himself the highest ideals, to  be an \"ensign to the nations,\" to bear before them the banner of God's  law, destined in time to effect the transformation of the whole of  mankind. Israel is a missionary to the nations. As such he must stand  before them as a model of holiness and purity. Here is the origin of  the great idea of the spiritual \"Messianism\" of the Jewish people, or,  better, its \"missionism,\" an eternal idea, far more comprehensive than  the old idea of national election, which it supplanted.      [11] Two Biblical passages, the one from Deuteronomy, the other      from Deutero-Isaiah, afford a signal illustration of the      contrast between the religious nationalism of the Mosaic law      and the universalism of the Prophets. Moses says to Israel:      \"Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy      God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,      above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord      did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were      more in number than any people: for ye were the fewest of all      people. But because the Lord loved you....\" (Deut. vii, 6-8).      And these are the words of the prophecy: \"Listen, O isles,      unto me, and hearken, ye people, from far! The Lord hath      called me... and said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel,      in whom I will be glorified! But I had thought, I have labored      in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain; yet      surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.      For now said the Lord unto me... It is too light a thing that      thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,      and to restore the preserved of Israel: no, I will also give      thee for a light to the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach      unto the end of the earth\" (Is. xlix, 1-6).    These sublime teachings were inculcated at the moment in which Judah  was hastening to meet his fate. It had become impossible to check the  natural results of the earlier transgressions. The inevitable  happened; Babylon the mighty laid her ponderous hand upon tiny Judah.  But Judah could not be crushed. From the heavy chastisement the Jewish  nation emerged purified, re-born for a new life.          VI    THE SECONDARY OR SPIRITUAL-POLITICAL PERIOD      The rank and file of a people are instructed by revolutions and  catastrophes better than by sermons. More quickly than Isaiah and  Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar brought the Jews to a recognition of their  tasks. The short span of the Babylonian Exile (586-538 B. C. E.) was a  period of introspection and searching self-examination for the people.  Spiritual forces hitherto latent came into play; a degree of  self-consciousness asserted itself. The people grasped its mission. At  last it comprehended that to imitate inferior races, instead of  teaching them and making itself a model for them to follow, was  treason to its vocation in life. When the hour of release from the  Babylonian yoke struck, the people suddenly saw under its feet \"a new  earth,\" and to \"a new heaven\" above it raised eyes dim with tears of  repentance and emotion. It renewed its covenant with God. Like the  Exodus from Egypt, so the second national deliverance was connected  with a revelation. But the messages delivered by the last  Prophets--especially by \"the great unknown,\" the author of the latter  part of the Book of Isaiah--were too exalted, too universal in  conception, for a people but lately emerged from a severe crisis to  set about their realization at once. They could only illumine its path  as a guiding-star, inspire it as the ultimate goal, the far-off  Messianic ideal. Meanwhile the necessity appeared for uniform  religious laws, dogmas, and customs, to bind the Jews together  externally as a nation. The moralizing religion of the Prophets was  calculated to bring about the regeneration of the individual,  regardless of national ties; but at that moment the chief point  involved was the nation. It had to be established and its organization  perfected. The universalism of the Prophets was inadequate for the  consolidating of a nation. To this end outward religious discipline  was requisite, an official cult and public ceremonies. Led by such  considerations, the Jewish captives, on their return to Jerusalem,  first of all devoted themselves to the erection of a Temple, to the  creating of a visible religious centre, which was to be the rallying  point for the whole nation.    The days of the Prophets were over. Their religious universalism could  apply only to a distant future. In the present, the nation, before it  might pose as a teacher, had to learn and grow spiritually strong.  Aims of such compass require centuries for their realization.  Therefore, the spiritual-national unification of the people was pushed  into the foreground. The place of the Prophet was filled by the Priest  and the Scribe. Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah were permeated by the  purpose to make religion and the cult subservient to the cause of  national union and isolation. The erection of the Temple, the solemn  service with the singing of Psalms and the public reading from the  \"Book of the Law\" (the Pentateuch, which underwent its final redaction  at that time), the removal of whatever might arouse the remembrance of  strange and heathen institutions--these were the levers of their  unifying activity. At first sight this activity might appear almost  too one-sided. But if we summon to mind a picture of the conditions  prevailing in those days, we are forced to the conclusion that, in the  interest of national restoration, a consistent course was imperative.  In point of fact, however, some of Ezra's innovations testify to the  broad-minded, reformatory character of this activity; as, for  instance, the public reading of the Pentateuch, introduced with a view  to making the people see the necessity of obtaining detailed knowledge  of the principles of its religion, and obeying the precepts of the  Law, not blindly, but with conscious assent. The object steadily aimed  at was the elevation of the whole body of the people to the plane of  spirituality, its transformation, in accordance with the Biblical  injunction, into a \"kingdom of priests.\"    This injunction of civilizing import became the starting point of the  activity of all of Ezra's successors, of the so-called school of the  _Soferim_, the Scribes, those versed in the art of writing. The  political calm that prevailed during the two centuries of the Persian  supremacy (538-332 B. C. E.), was calculated to an eminent degree to  promote spiritual development and the organization of the inner life  of the people. During this period, a large part of the writings after  the Pentateuch that have been received into the Bible were collected,  compiled, and reduced to writing. The immortal thoughts of the  Prophets clothed themselves in the visible garb of letters. On  parchment rolls and in books they were made accessible to distant  ages. The impressive traditions transmitted from earliest times, the  chronicles of the past of the people, the Psalms brought forth by the  religious enthusiasm of a long series of poets, all were gathered and  put into literary shape with the extreme of care. The spiritual  treasures of the nation were capitalized, and to this process of  capitalization solely and alone generations of men have owed the  possibility of resorting to them as a source of faith and knowledge.  Without the work of compilation achieved by the _Soferim_, of  which the uninstructed are apt to speak slightingly, mankind to-day  had no Bible, that central sun in world-literature.    These two centuries may fitly be called the school-days of the Jewish  nation; the Scribes were the teachers of Jewry. In the way of original  work but little was produced. The people fed upon the store of  spiritual food, of which sufficient had been laid up for several  generations. It was then that the Jews first earned their title to the  name, \"the People of the Book.\" They made subservient to themselves  the two mightiest instruments of thought, the art of writing and of  reading. Their progress was brilliant, and when their schooling had  come to an end, and they stepped out into the broader life, they were  at once able to apply their knowledge successfully to practical  contingencies. They were prepared for all the vicissitudes of life.  Their spiritual equipment was complete.    Nothing could have been more opportune than this readiness to assume  the responsibilities of existence, for a time of peril and menace was  again approaching. From out of the West, a new agent of civilization,  Hellenism, advanced upon the East. Alexander the Great had put an end  to the huge Persian monarchy, and brought the whole of Western Asia  under his dominion (332 B. C. E.). His generals divided the conquered  lands among themselves. With all their might, the Ptolemies in Egypt  and the Seleucidae in Syria hellenized the countries subject to their  rule.

And Man said in his heart: \"Just one invention more. There is  something I want to do with petrol yet, and then I will give it all  up and go back to the woods.\"          LOBSTER SALAD      I was climbing round the perilous outside of the Palace of  Colquonhombros. So far below me that in the tranquil twilight  and clear air of those lands I could only barely see them lay the  craggy tops of the mountains.    It was along no battlements or terrace edge I was climbing, but  on the sheer face of the wall itself, getting what foothold I could  where the boulders joined.    Had my feet been bare I was done, but though I was in my  night-shirt I had on stout leather boots, and their edges somehow  held in those narrow cracks. My fingers and wrists were aching.    Had it been possible to stop for a moment I might have been lured  to give a second look at the fearful peaks of the mountains down  there in the twilight, and this must have been fatal.    That the thing was all a dream is beside the point. We have fallen  in dreams before, but it is well known that if in one of those falls  you ever hit the ground--you die: I had looked at those menacing  mountaintops and knew well that such a fall as the one I feared  must have such a termination. Then I went on.    It is strange what different sensations there can be in different  boulders--every one gleaming with the same white light and every  one chosen to match the rest by minions of ancient kings--when  your life depends on the edges of every one you come to. Those  edges seemed strangely different. It was of no avail to overcome  the terror of one, for the next would give you a hold in quite a  different way or hand you over to death in a different manner.  Some were too sharp to hold and some too flush with the wall,  those whose hold was the best crumbled the soonest; each rock  had its different terror: and then there were those things that followed  behind me.    And at last I came to a breach made long ago by earthquake,  lightning or war: I should have had to go down a thousand feet  to get round it and they would come up with me while I was doing  that, for certain sable apes that I have not mentioned as yet, things  that had tigerish teeth and were born and bred on that wall, had  pursued me all the evening. In any case I could have gone no  farther, nor did I know what the king would do along whose wall  I was climbing. It was time to drop and be done with it or stop and  await those apes.    And then it was that I remembered a pin, thrown carelessly down  out of an evening-tie in another world to the one where grew that  glittering wall, and lying now if no evil chance had removed it on a  chest of drawers by my bed. The apes were very close, and hurrying,  for they knew my fingers were slipping, and the cruel peaks of those  infernal mountains seemed surer of me than the apes. I reached out  with a desperate effort of will towards where the pin lay on the chest  of drawers. I groped about. I found it! I ran it into my arm. Saved!          THE RETURN OF THE EXILES      The old man with a hammer and the one-eyed man with a spear were  seated by the roadside talking as I came up the hill.    \"It isn't as though they hadn't asked us,\" the one with the hammer said.    \"There ain't no more than twenty as knows about it,\" said the other.    \"Twenty's twenty,\" said the first.    \"After all these years,\" said the one-eyed man with the spear. \"After  all these years. We might go back just once.\"    \"O' course we might,\" said the other.    Their clothes were old even for laborers, the one with the hammer  had a leather apron full of holes and blackened, and their hands  looked like leather. But whatever they were they were English, and  this was pleasant to see after all the motors that had passed me that  day with their burden of mixed and doubtful nationalities.    When they saw me the one with the hammer touched his greasy cap.    \"Might we make so bold, sir,\" he said, \"as the ask the way to  Stonehenge?\"    \"We never ought to go,\" mumbled the other plaintively. \"There's  not more than twenty as knows, but....\"    I was bicycling there myself to see the place so I pointed out the  way and rode on at once, for there was something so utterly servile  about them both that I did not care for their company. They seemed  by their wretched mien to have been persecuted or utterly neglected  for many years, I thought that very likely they had done long terms  of penal servitude.    When I came to Stonehenge I saw a group of about a score of men  standing among the stones. They asked me with some solemnity if  I was expecting anyone, and when I said No they spoke to me no  more. It was three miles back where I left those strange old men,  but I had not been in the stone circle long when they appeared,  coming with great strides along the road. When they saw them all  the people took off their hats and acted very strangely, and I saw  that they had a goat which they led up then to the old altar stone.  And the two old men came up with their hammer and spear and  began apologizing plaintively for the liberty they had taken in coming  back to that place, and all the people knelt on the grass before them.  And then still kneeling they killed the goat by the altar, and when the  two old men saw this they came up with many excuses and eagerly  sniffed the blood. And at first this made them happy. But soon the  one with the spear began to whimper. \"It used to be men,\" he  lamented. \"It used to be men.\"    And the twenty men began looking uneasily at each other, and the  plaint of the one-eyed man went on in that tearful voice, and all of  a sudden they all looked at me. I do not know who the two old men  were or what any of them were doing, but there are moments when  it is clearly time to go, and I left them there and then. And just as I  got up on to my bicycle I heard the plaintive voice of the one with the  hammer apologizing for the liberty he had taken in coming back to  Stonehenge.    \"But after all these years,\" I heard him crying, \"After all these  years....\"    And the one with the spear said: \"Yes, after three thousand years....\"          NATURE AND TIME      Through the streets of Coventry one winter's night strode a  triumphant spirit. Behind him stooping, unkempt, utterly ragged,  wearing the clothes and look that outcasts have, whining, weeping,  reproaching, an ill-used spirit tried to keep pace with him. Continually  she plucked him by the sleeve and cried out to him as she panted  after and he strode resolute on.    It was a bitter night, yet it did not seem to be the cold that she feared,  ill-clad though she was, but the trams and the ugly shops and the glare  of the factories, from which she continually winced as she hobbled on,  and the pavement hurt her feet.    He that strode on in front seemed to care for nothing, it might be hot  or cold, silent or noisy, pavement or open fields, he merely had the  air of striding on.    And she caught up and clutched him by the elbow. I heard her  speak in her unhappy voice, you scarcely heard it for the noise of  the traffic.    \"You have forgotten me,\" she complained to him. \"You have forsaken  me here.\"    She pointed to Coventry with a wide wave of her arm and seemed  to indicate other cities beyond. And he gruffly told her to keep  pace with him and that he did not forsake her. And she went on  with her pitiful lamentation.    \"My anemones are dead for miles,\" she said, \"all my woods are  fallen and still the cities grow. My child Man is unhappy and my other  children are dying, and still the cities grow and you have forgotten me!\"    And then he turned angrily on her, almost stopping in that stride of  his that began when the stars were made.    \"When have I ever forgotten you?\" he said, \"or when forsaken you  ever? Did I not throw down Babylon for you? And is not Nineveh  gone? Where is Persepolis that troubled you? Where Tarshish and  Tyre? And you have said I forget you.\"    And at this she seemed to take a little comfort. I heard her speak  once more, looking wistfully at her companion. \"When will the fields  come back and the grass for my children?\"    \"Soon, soon,\" he said: then they were silent. And he strode away,  she limping along behind him, and all the clocks in the towers chimed  as he passed.          THE SONG OF THE BLACKBIRD      As the poet passed the thorn-tree the blackbird sang.    \"How ever do you do it?\" the poet said, for he knew bird language.    \"It was like this,\" said the blackbird. \"It really was the most  extraordinary thing. I made that song last Spring, it came to me  all of a sudden. There was the most beautiful she-blackbird that  the world has ever seen. Her eyes were blacker than lakes are at  night, her feathers were blacker than the night itself, and nothing was  as yellow as her beak; she could fly much faster than the lightning.  She was not an ordinary she-blackbird, there has never been any  other like her at all. I did not dare go near her because she was so  wonderful. One day last Spring when it got warm again--it had been  cold, we ate berries, things were quite different then, but Spring came  and it got warm--one day I was thinking how wonderful she was and  it seemed so extraordinary to think that I should ever have seen her,  the only really wonderful she-blackbird in the world, that I opened  my beak to give a shout, and then this song came, and there had  never been anything like it before, and luckily I remembered it, the  very song that I sang just now. But what is so extraordinary, the most  amazing occurence of that marvellous day, was that no sooner had I  sung the song than that very bird, the most wonderful she-blackbird  in the world, flew right up to me and sat quite close to me on the same  tree. I never remember such wonderful times as those.    \"Yes, the song"]]]
