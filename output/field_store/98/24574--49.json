'Good night!'    \"'Bobbie, Bobbie,' she says, sharply. 'That isn't our room; _this_ is  our room, Bobbie. Come back at once! What do you mean, Bobbie? _Do you  hear me, Bobbie?_'    \"So Bobbie came back, and went in with the scarecrow. Next morning she  was first at the breakfast table, in a dressing-gown and curl papers.  And when they were all sitting down Bobbie sneaked in, looking awfully  sheepish, and sidled for his chair at the other end of the table. But  she'd her eyes on him.    \"'Bobbie, Bobbie!' she said, 'Come and kiss me, Bobbie!'\" And he had to  do it in front of them all.    \"But I believe she made him a good wife.\"          HIS COUNTRY-AFTER ALL      The Blenheim coach was descending into the valley of the Avetere  River--pronounced Aveterry--from the saddle of Taylor's Pass. Across  the river to the right, the grey slopes and flats stretched away to  the distant sea from a range of tussock hills. There was no native bush  there; but there were several groves of imported timber standing wide  apart---sentinel-like--seeming lonely and striking in their isolation.    \"Grand country, New Zealand, eh?\" said a stout man with a brown face,  grey beard, and grey eyes, who sat between the driver and another  passenger on the box.    \"You don't call this grand country!\" exclaimed the other passenger, who  claimed to be, and looked like, a commercial traveller, and might have  been a professional spieler--quite possibly both. \"Why, it's about the  poorest country in New Zealand! You ought to see some of the country in  the North Island--Wairarapa and Napier districts, round about Pahiatua.  I call this damn poor country.\"    \"Well, I reckon you wouldn't, if you'd ever been in Australia--back in  New South Wales. The people here don't seem to know what a grand country  they've got. You say this is the worst, eh? Well, this would make an  Australian cockatoo's mouth water-the worst of New Zealand would.\"    \"I always thought Australia was all good country,\" mused the driver--a  flax-stick. \"I always thought--\"    \"Good country!\" exclaimed the man with the grey beard, in a tone of  disgust. \"Why, it's only a mongrel desert, except some bits round the  coast. The worst dried-up and God-forsaken country I was ever in.\"    There was a silence, thoughtful on the driver's part, and aggressive on  that of the stranger.    \"I always thought,\" said the driver, reflectively, after the pause--\"I  always thought Australia was a good country,\" and he placed his foot on  the brake.    They let him think. The coach descended the natural terraces above the  river bank, and pulled up at the pub.      \"So you're a native of Australia?\" said the bagman to the grey-beard, as  the coach went on again.    \"Well, I suppose I am. Anyway, I was born there. That's the main thing  I've got against the darned country.\"    \"How long did you stay there?\"    \"Till I got away,\" said the stranger. Then, after a think, he added, \"I  went away first when I was thirty-five--went to the islands. I swore I'd  never go back to Australia again; but I did. I thought I had a kind of  affection for old Sydney. I knocked about the blasted country for five  or six years, and then I cleared out to 'Frisco. I swore I'd never go  back again, and I never will.\"    \"But surely you'll take a run over and have a look at old Sydney and  those places, before you go back to America, after getting so near?\"    \"What the blazes do I want to have a look at the blamed country for?\"  snapped the stranger, who had refreshed considerably. \"I've got nothing  to thank Australia for--except getting out of it. It's the best country  to get out of that I was ever in.\"    \"Oh, well, I only thought you might have had some friends over there,\"  interposed the traveller in an injured tone.    \"Friends! That's another reason. I wouldn't go back there for all the  friends and relations since Adam. I had more than quite enough of it  while I was there. The worst and hardest years of my life were spent  in Australia. I might have starved there, and did do it half my time. I  worked harder and got less in my own country in five years than I ever  did in any other in fifteen\"--he was getting mixed--\"and I've been in  a few since then. No, Australia is the worst country that ever the Lord  had the sense to forget. I mean to stick to the country that stuck to  me, when I was starved out of my own dear native land--and that country  is the United States of America. What's Australia? A big, thirsty,  hungry wilderness, with one or two cities for the convenience of foreign  speculators, and a few collections of humpies, called towns--also for  the convenience of foreign speculators; and populated mostly by mongrel  sheep, and partly by fools, who live like European slaves in the towns,  and like dingoes in the bush--who drivel about 'democracy,' and yet  haven't any more spunk than to graft for a few Cockney dudes that  razzle-dazzle most of the time in Paris. Why, the Australians haven't  even got the grit to claim enough of their own money to throw a few dams  across their watercourses, and so make some of the interior fit to live  in. America's bad enough, but it was never so small as that.... Bah! The  curse of Australia is sheep, and the Australian war cry is Baa!\"    \"Well, you're the first man I ever heard talk as you've been doing about  his own country,\" said the bagman, getting tired and impatient of being  sat on all the time. \"'Lives there a man with a soul so dead, who never  said--to--to himself'... I forget the darned thing.\"    He tried to remember it. The man whose soul was dead cleared his throat  for action, and the driver--for whom the bagman had shouted twice as  against the stranger's once--took the opportunity to observe that he  always thought a man ought to stick up for his own country.    The stranger ignored him and opened fire on the bagman. He proceeded to  prove that that was all rot--that patriotism was the greatest curse on  earth; that it had been the cause of all war; that it was the false,  ignorant sentiment which moved men to slave, starve, and fight for the  comfort of their sluggish masters; that it was the enemy of universal  brotherhood, the mother of hatred, murder, and slavery, and that the  world would never be any better until the deadly poison, called the  sentiment of patriotism, had been \"educated\" out of the stomachs of the  people. \"Patriotism!\" he exclaimed scornfully. \"My country! The darned  fools; the country never belonged to them, but to the speculators,  the absentees, land-boomers, swindlers, gangs of thieves--the men the  patriotic fools starve and fight for--their masters. Ba-a!\"    The opposition collapsed.    The coach had climbed the terraces on the south side of the river, and  was bowling along on a level stretch of road across the elevated flat.    \"What trees are those?\" asked the stranger, breaking the aggressive  silence which followed his unpatriotic argument, and pointing to a grove  ahead by the roadside. \"They look as if they've been planted there.  There ain't been a forest here surely?\"    \"Oh, they're some trees the Government imported,\" said the bagman, whose  knowledge on the subject was limited. \"Our own bush won't grow in this  soil.\"    \"But it looks as if anything else would--\"    Here the stranger sniffed once by accident, and then several times with  interest.    It was a warm morning after rain. He fixed his eyes on those trees.    They didn't look like Australian gums; they tapered to the tops, the  branches were pretty regular, and the boughs hung in shipshape fashion.  There was not the Australian heat to twist the branches and turn the  leaves.    \"Why!\" exclaimed the stranger, still staring and sniffing hard. \"Why,  dang me if they ain't (sniff) Australian gums!\"    \"Yes,\" said the driver, flicking his horses, \"they are.\"    \"Blanky (sniff) blanky old Australian gums!\" exclaimed the  ex-Australian, with strange enthusiasm.    \"They're not old,\" said the driver; \"they're only young trees. But they  say they don't grow like that in Australia--'count of the difference in  the climate. I always thought--\"    But the other did not appear to hear him; he kept staring hard at the  trees they were passing. They had been planted in rows and cross-rows,  and were coming on grandly.    There was a rabbit trapper's camp amongst those trees; he had made a  fire to boil his billy with gum-leaves and twigs, and it was the scent  of that fire which interested the exile's nose, and brought a wave of  memories with it.    \"Good day, mate!\" he shouted suddenly to the rabbit trapper, and to the  astonishment of his fellow passengers.    \"Good day, mate!\" The answer came back like an echo--it seemed to  him--from the past.    Presently he caught sight of a few trees which had evidently been  planted before the others--as an experiment, perhaps--and, somehow,  one of them had grown after its own erratic native fashion--gnarled and  twisted and ragged, and could not be mistaken for anything else but an  Australian gum.    \"A thunderin' old blue-gum!\" ejaculated the traveller, regarding the  tree with great interest.    He screwed his neck to get a last glimpse, and then sat silently smoking  and gazing straight ahead, as if the past lay before him--and it _was_  before him.    \"Ah, well!\" he said, in explanation of a long meditative silence on  his part; \"ah, well--them saplings--the smell of them gum-leaves set me  thinking.\" And he thought some more.    \"Well, for my part,\" said a tourist in the coach, presently, in a  condescending tone, \"I can't see much in Australia. The bally colonies  are--\"    \"Oh, that be damned!\" snarled the Australian-born--they had finished the  second flask of whisky. \"What do you Britishers know about Australia?  She's as good as England, anyway.\"      \"Well, I suppose you'll"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#8)"],[1,"on Monday.  5.

COMPOUND SUBJECT AND COMPOUND PREDICATE.    CONJUNCTIONS AND INTERJECTIONS.    +Introductory Hints.+--_Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth reigned in England._  The three words _Edward, Mary,_ and _Elizabeth_ have the same  predicate--the same act being asserted of the king and the two queens.  _Edward, Mary_, and _Elizabeth_ are connected by _and_, _and_ being  understood between Edward and Mary. Connected subjects having the same  predicate form a +Compound Subject+.    _Charles I. was seized, was tried, and was beheaded._ The three predicates  _was seized, was tried_, and _was beheaded_ have the same subject--the  three acts being asserted of the same king. Connected predicates having the  same subject form a +Compound Predicate.+    A sentence may have both a compound subject and a compound predicate; as,  _Mary_ and _Elizabeth lived_ and _reigned_ in England.    The words connecting the parts of a compound subject or of a compound  predicate are called +Conjunctions+ (Lat. _con_, or _cum_, together, and  _jungere_, to join).    A conjunction may connect other parts of the sentence, as two word  modifiers--A dark _and_ rainy night follows; Some men sin deliberately  _and_ presumptuously.    It may connect two phrases; as, The equinox occurs in March _and_ in  September.    It may connect two clauses, that is, expressions that, standing alone,  would be sentences; as, The leaves of the pine fall in spring, _but_ the  leaves of the maple drop in autumn.    +Interjections+ (Lat. _inter_, between, and _jacere_, to throw) are the  eighth and last part of speech.    _Oh! ah! pooh! pshaw!_ etc., express bursts of feeling too sudden and  violent for deliberate sentences.    _Hail! fudge! indeed! amen! _etc., express condensed thought as well as  feeling.    Any part of speech may be wrenched from its construction with other words,  and may lapse into an interjection; _as, behold! shame! what!_    Professor Sweet calls interjections _sentence-words_.      Two or more connected subjects having the same predicate form a +Compound  Subject+.    Two or more connected predicates having the same subject form a +Compound  Predicate+.    +DEFINITION.--A _Conjunction_ is a word used to connect words, phrases, or  clauses.+    +DEFINITION.--An _Interjection_ is a word used to express strong or sudden  feeling.+    Analysis and Parsing.    1.

They are connected by dotted lines, which stand for  the connecting word. The x shows that a conjunction is understood. The line  standing for the word modifier is joined to that part of the subject line  which represents the entire subject. Turn this diagram about, and the  connected horizontal lines will stand for the parts of a compound  predicate.    +Oral Analysis+.---_Wives, sisters_, and _mothers_ form the compound  subject; _anxious_ is a modifier of the compound subject; _and_ connects  _sisters_ and _mothers_.    +Parsing+.--_And_ is a conjunction connecting _sisters_ and _mothers_; _ah_  is an interjection, expressing a sudden burst of feeling.    2.

Two or more phrases connected by a conjunction form a  +Compound Phrase+.    +Direction.+--_Pick out the simple, the complex, and the compound phrases  in the sentences above._           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 21.    COMPOSITION---CONNECTED TERMS AND INTERJECTIONS.    +COMMA--RULE.--Words or phrases connected by conjunctions are separated  from each other by the comma unless all the conjunctions are expressed.+    +Remark+.--When words and phrases stand in pairs, the pairs are separated  according to the Rule, but the words of each pair are not.    When one of two terms has a modifier that without the comma might be  referred to both, or, when the parts of compound predicates and of other  phrases are long or differently modified, these terms or parts are  separated by the comma though no conjunction is omitted.    When two terms connected by or have the same meaning, the second is  logically explanatory of the first,"]]]
