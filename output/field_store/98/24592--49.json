In former times, however, as there was a greater  propensity and freer scope for the performance of actions worthy of  remembrance, so every person of distinguished abilities was induced  through conscious satisfaction in the task alone, without regard to  private favor or interest, to record examples of virtue. And many  considered it rather as the honest confidence of integrity, than a  culpable arrogance, to become their own biographers. Of this, Rutilius  and Scaurus [1] were instances; who were never yet censured on this  account, nor was the fidelity of their narrative called in question; so  much more candidly are virtues always estimated; in those periods which  are the most favorable to their production. For myself, however, who  have undertaken to be the historian of a person deceased, an apology  seemed necessary; which I should not have made, had my course lain  through times less cruel and hostile to virtue. [2]    2. We read that when Arulenus Rusticus published the praises of Paetus  Thrasea, and Herennius Senecio those of Priscus Helvidius, it was  construed into a capital crime; [3] and the rage of tyranny was let  loose not only against the authors, but against their writings; so that  those monuments of exalted genius were burnt at the place of election  in the forum by triumvirs appointed for the purpose. In that fire they  thought to consume the voice of the Roman people, the freedom of the  senate, and the conscious emotions of all mankind; crowning the deed  by the expulsion of the professors of wisdom, [4] and the banishment of  every liberal art, that nothing generous or honorable might remain. We  gave, indeed, a consummate proof of our patience; and as remote ages saw  the very utmost degree of liberty, so we, deprived by inquisitions of  all the intercourse of conversation, experienced the utmost of slavery.  With language we should have lost memory itself, had it been as much in  our power to forget, as to be silent.    3. Now our spirits begin to revive. But although at the first dawning  of this happy period, [5] the emperor Nerva united two things before  incompatible, monarchy and liberty; and Trajan is now daily augmenting  the felicity of the empire; and the public security [6] has not only  assumed hopes and wishes, but has seen those wishes arise to confidence  and stability; yet, from the nature of human infirmity, remedies are  more tardy in their operation than diseases; and, as bodies slowly  increase, but quickly perish, so it is more easy to suppress industry  and genius, than to recall them. For indolence itself acquires a charm;  and sloth, however odious at first, becomes at length engaging. During  the space of fifteen years, [7] a large portion of human life, how great  a number have fallen by casual events, and, as was the fate of all the  most distinguished, by the cruelty of the prince; whilst we, the few  survivors, not of others alone, but, if I may be allowed the expression,  of ourselves, find a void of so many years in our lives, which has  silently brought us from youth to maturity, from mature age to the  very verge of life! Still, however, I shall not regret having composed,  though in rude and artless language, a memorial of past servitude, and a  testimony of present blessings. [8]    The present work, in the meantime, which is dedicated to the honor of my  father-in-law, may be thought to merit approbation, or at least excuse,  from the piety of the intention.    4. CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and illustrious colony  of Forumjulii. [9] Both his grandfathers were imperial procurators, [10]  an office which confers the rank of equestrian nobility. His father,  Julius Graecinus, [11] of the senatorian order, was famous for the study  of eloquence and philosophy; and by these accomplishments he drew on  himself the displeasure of Caius Caesar; [12] for, being commanded to  undertake the accusation of Marcus Silanus, [13]--on his refusal, he  was put to death. His mother was Julia Procilla, a lady of exemplary  chastity. Educated with tenderness in her bosom, [14] he passed his  childhood and youth in the attainment of every liberal art. He was  preserved from the allurements of vice, not only by a naturally good  disposition, but by being sent very early to pursue his studies at  Massilia; [15] a place where Grecian politeness and provincial frugality  are happily united. I remember he was used to relate, that in his  early youth he should have engaged with more ardor in philosophical  speculation than was suitable to a Roman and a senator, had not the  prudence of his mother restrained the warmth and vehemence of his  disposition: for his lofty and upright spirit, inflamed by the charms of  glory and exalted reputation, led him to the pursuit with more eagerness  than discretion. Reason and riper years tempered his warmth; and  from the study of wisdom, he retained what is most difficult to  compass,--moderation.    5. He learned the rudiments of war in Britain, under Suetonius  Paullinus, an active and prudent commander, who chose him for his tent  companion, in order to form an estimate of his merit. [16] Nor did  Agricola, like many young men, who convert military service into wanton  pastime, avail himself licentiously or slothfully of his tribunitial  title, or his inexperience, to spend his time in pleasures and absences  from duty; but he employed himself in gaining a knowledge of  the country, making himself known to the army, learning from the  experienced, and imitating the best; neither pressing to be employed  through vainglory, nor declining it through timidity; and performing  his duty with equal solicitude and spirit. At no other time in truth was  Britain more agitated or in a state of greater uncertainty. Our veterans  slaughtered, our colonies burnt, [17] our armies cut off, [18]--we were  then contending for safety, afterwards for victory. During this period,  although all things were transacted under the conduct and direction of  another, and the stress of the whole, as well as the glory of recovering  the province, fell to the general's share, yet they imparted to the  young Agricola skill, experience, and incentives; and the passion for  military glory entered his soul; a passion ungrateful to the times, [19]  in which eminence was unfavorably construed, and a great reputation was  no less dangerous than a bad one.    6. Departing thence to undertake the offices of magistracy in Rome, he  married Domitia Decidiana, a lady of illustrious descent, from which  connection he derived credit and support in his pursuit of greater  things. They lived together in admirable harmony and mutual affection;  each giving the preference to the other; a conduct equally laudable in  both, except that a greater degree of praise is due to a good wife,  in proportion as a bad one deserves the greater censure. The lot of  quaestorship [20] gave him Asia for his province, and the proconsul  Salvius Titianus [21] for his superior; by neither of which  circumstances was he corrupted, although the province was wealthy and  open to plunder, and the proconsul, from his rapacious disposition,  would readily have agreed to a mutual concealment of guilt. His family  was there increased by the birth of a daughter, who was both the support  of his house, and his consolation; for he lost an elder-born son in  infancy. The interval between his serving the offices of quaestor and  tribune of the people, and even the year of the latter magistracy, he  passed in repose and inactivity; well knowing the temper of the times  under Nero, in which indolence was wisdom. He maintained the same tenor  of conduct when praetor; for the judiciary part of the office did not  fall to his share. [22] In the exhibition of public games, and the idle  trappings of dignity, he consulted propriety and the measure of his  fortune; by no means approaching to extravagance, yet inclining rather  to a popular course. When he was afterwards appointed by Galba to manage  an inquest concerning the offerings which had been presented to the  temples, by his strict attention and diligence he preserved the state  from any further sacrilege than what it had suffered from Nero. [23]    7. The following year [24] inflicted a severe wound on his peace  of mind, and his domestic concerns. The fleet of Otho, roving in  a disorderly manner on the coast, [25] made a hostile descent on  Intemelii, [26] a part of Liguria, in which the mother of Agricola was  murdered at her own estate, her lands were ravaged, and a great part  of her effects, which had invited the assassins, was carried off. As  Agricola upon this event was hastening to perform the duties of filial  piety, he was overtaken by the news of Vespasian's aspiring to the  empire, [27] and immediately went over to his party. The first acts  of power, and the government of the city, were entrusted to Mucianus;  Domitian being at that time very young, and taking no other privilege  from his father's elevation than that of indulging his licentious  tastes. Mucianus, having approved the vigor and fidelity of Agricola  in the service of raising levies, gave him the command of the twentieth  legion, [28] which had appeared backward in taking the oaths, as soon as  he had heard the seditious practices of his commander. [29] This legion  had been unmanageable and formidable even to the consular lieutenants;  [30] and its late commander, of praetorian rank, had not sufficient  authority to keep it in obedience; though it was uncertain whether from  his own disposition, or that of his soldiers. Agricola was therefore  appointed as his successor and avenger; but, with an uncommon degree  of moderation, he chose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#8)"],[1,"greater than  his knowledge, wasted no time in preliminary explorations. At once he  began to dig. And he dug with such zeal and such speed that his trench  went straight through the heart of the city for which he was looking  and carried him to the ruins of another buried town which was at least  a thousand years older than the Troy of which Homer had written. Then  something very interesting occurred. If Schliemann had found a few  polished stone hammers and perhaps a few pieces of crude pottery, no one  would have been surprised. Instead of discovering such objects, which  people had generally associated with the prehistoric men who had lived  in these regions before the coming of the Greeks, Schliemann found  beautiful statuettes and very costly jewelry and ornamented vases of a  pattern that was unknown to the Greeks. He ventured the suggestion that  fully ten centuries before the great Trojan war, the coast of the AEgean  had been inhabited by a mysterious race of men who in many ways had been  the superiors of the wild Greek tribes who had invaded their country and  had destroyed their civilisation or absorbed it until it had lost  all trace of originality. And this proved to be the case. In the late  seventies of the last century, Schliemann visited the ruins of Mycenae,  ruins which were so old that Roman guide-books marvelled at their  antiquity. There again, beneath the flat slabs of stone of a small round  enclosure, Schliemann stumbled upon a wonderful treasure-trove, which  had been left behind by those mysterious people who had covered the  Greek coast with their cities and who had built walls, so big and so  heavy and so strong, that the Greeks called them the work of the Titans,  those god-like giants who in very olden days had used to play ball with  mountain peaks.    A very careful study of these many relics has done away with some of the  romantic features of the story. The makers of these early works of  art and the builders of these strong fortresses were no sorcerers, but  simple sailors and traders. They had lived in Crete, and on the many  small islands of the AEgean Sea. They had been hardy mariners and they  had turned the AEgean into a center of commerce for the exchange of  goods between the highly civilised east and the slowly developing  wilderness of the European mainland.    For more than a thousand years they had maintained an island empire  which had developed a very high form of art. Indeed their most important  city, Cnossus, on the northern coast of Crete, had been entirely modern  in its insistence upon hygiene and comfort. The palace had been properly  drained and the houses had been provided with stoves and the Cnossians  had been the first people to make a daily use of the hitherto unknown  bathtub. The palace of their King had been famous for its winding  staircases and its large banqueting hall. The cellars underneath this  palace, where the wine and the grain and the olive-oil were stored, had  been so vast and had so greatly impressed the first Greek visitors, that  they had given rise to the story of the \"labyrinth,\" the name which we  give to a structure with so many complicated passages that it is almost  impossible to find our way out, once the front door has closed upon our  frightened selves.    But what finally became of this great AEgean Empire and what caused its  sudden downfall, that I can not tell.    The Cretans were familiar with the art of writing, but no one has yet  been able to decipher their inscriptions. Their history therefore is  unknown to us. We have to reconstruct the record of their adventures  from the ruins which the AEgeans have left behind. These ruins make it  clear that the AEgean world was suddenly conquered by a less civilised  race which had recently come from the plains of northern Europe. Unless  we are very much mistaken, the savages who were responsible for the  destruction of the Cretan and the AEgean civilisation were none other  than certain tribes of wandering shepherds who had just taken possession  of the rocky peninsula between the Adriatic and the AEgean seas and who  are known to us as Greeks.          THE GREEKS    MEANWHILE THE INDO-EUROPEAN TRIBE OF THE HELLENES WAS TAKING POSSESSION  OF GREECE      THE Pyramids were a thousand years old and were beginning to show the  first signs of decay, and Hammurabi, the wise king of Babylon, had been  dead and buried several centuries, when a small tribe of shepherds left  their homes along the banks of the River Danube and wandered southward  in search of fresh pastures. They called themselves Hellenes, after  Hellen, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha. According to the old myths  these were the only two human beings who had escaped the great flood,  which countless years before had destroyed all the people of the world,  when they had grown so wicked that they disgusted Zeus, the mighty God,  who lived on Mount Olympus.    Of these early Hellenes we know nothing. Thucydides, the historian of  the fall of Athens, describing his earliest ancestors, said that they  \"did not amount to very much,\" and this was probably true. They were  very ill-mannered. They lived like pigs and threw the bodies of their  enemies to the wild dogs who guarded their sheep. They had very little  respect for other people's rights, and they killed the natives of the  Greek peninsula (who were called the Pelasgians) and stole their farms  and took their cattle and made their wives and daughters slaves and  wrote endless songs praising the courage of the clan of the Achaeans,  who had led the Hellenic advance-guard into the mountains of Thessaly  and the Peloponnesus.    But here and there, on the tops of high rocks, they saw the castles  of the AEgeans and those they did not attack for they feared the metal  swords and the spears of the AEgean soldiers and knew that they could  not hope to defeat them with their clumsy stone axes.    For many centuries they continued to wander from valley to valley and  from mountain side to mountain side Then the whole of the land had been  occupied and the migration had come to an end.    That moment was the beginning of Greek civilisation. The Greek farmer,  living within sight of the AEgean colonies, was finally driven by  curiosity to visit his haughty neighbours. He discovered that he could  learn many useful things from the men who dwelt behind the high stone  walls of Mycenae, and Tiryns.    He was a clever pupil. Within a short time he mastered the art of  handling those strange iron weapons which the AEgeans had brought  from Babylon and from Thebes. He came to understand the mysteries of  navigation. He began to build little boats for his own use.    And when he had learned everything the AEgeans could teach him he turned  upon his teachers and drove them back to their islands. Soon afterwards  he ventured forth upon the sea and conquered all the cities of the  AEgean. Finally in the fifteenth century before our era he plundered and  ravaged Cnossus and ten centuries after their first appearance upon the  scene the Hellenes were the undisputed rulers of Greece, of the  AEgean and of the coastal regions of Asia Minor. Troy, the last great  commercial stronghold of the older civilisation, was destroyed in the  eleventh century B.C. European history was to begin in all seriousness.          THE GREEK CITIES    THE GREEK CITIES THAT WERE REALLY STATES      WE modern people love the sound of the word \"big.\" We pride ourselves  upon the fact that we belong to the \"biggest\" country in the world and  possess the \"biggest\" navy and grow the \"biggest\" oranges and potatoes,  and we love to live in cities of \"millions\" of inhabitants and when we  are dead we are buried in the \"biggest cemetery of the whole state.\"    A citizen of ancient Greece, could he have heard us talk, would not have  known what we meant. \"Moderation in all things\" was the ideal of  his life and mere bulk did not impress him at all. And this love of  moderation was not merely a hollow phrase used upon special occasions:  it influenced the life of the Greeks from the day of their birth to the  hour of their death. It was part of their literature and it made them  build small but perfect temples. It found expression in the clothes  which the men wore and in the rings and the bracelets of their wives. It  followed the crowds that went to the theatre and made them hoot down any  playwright who dared to sin against the iron law of good taste or good  sense.    The Greeks even insisted upon this quality in their politicians and in  their most popular athletes. When a powerful runner came to Sparta and  boasted that he could stand longer on one foot than any other man in  Hellas the people drove him from the city because he prided himself  upon an accomplishment at which he could be beaten by any common goose.  \"That is all very well,\" you will say, \"and no doubt it is a great  virtue to care so much for moderation and perfection, but why should  the Greeks have been the only people to develop this quality in olden  times?\" For an answer I shall point to the way in which the Greeks  lived.    The people of Egypt or Mesopotamia had been the \"subjects\" of a  mysterious Supreme Ruler who lived miles and miles away in a dark palace  and who was rarely seen by the masses of the population. The Greeks on  the other hand, were \"free citizens\" of a hundred independent little  \"cities\" the largest of which counted fewer inhabitants than a large  modern village. When a peasant who lived in Ur said that he was a  Babylonian he meant that he was one of millions of other people who paid  tribute to the king who at that particular moment happened to be master  of western Asia. But when a Greek said proudly that he was an Athenian  or a Theban he spoke of a small town, which was both his home and his  country and which recognised no master but the will of the people in the  market-place.    To the Greek, his"]]]
