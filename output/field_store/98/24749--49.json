She  caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the windows at the end of the  greenhouse. Then she re-entered. She tugged now with renewed strength at  Wedderburn's motionless body, and brought the strange orchid crashing to  the floor. It still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim. In a  frenzy, she lugged it and him into the open air.    Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one, and in  another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the  horror.    He was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches.    The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the smashing of glass,  and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands. For  a moment he thought impossible things.    \"Bring some water!\" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies. When,  with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found her weeping  with excitement, and with Wedderburn's head upon her knee, wiping the  blood from his face.    \"What's the matter?\" said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly, and closing  them again at once.    \"Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Dr. Haddon at  once,\" she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought the water; and  added, seeing he hesitated, \"I will tell you all about it when you come  back.\"    Presently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he was  troubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, \"You fainted  in the hothouse.\"    \"And the orchid?\"    \"I will see to that,\" she said.    Wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he had suffered  no very great injury. They gave him brandy mixed with some pink extract of  meat, and carried him upstairs to bed. His housekeeper told her incredible  story in fragments to Dr. Haddon. \"Come to the orchid-house and see,\" she  said.    The cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and the sickly  perfume was almost dispelled. Most of the torn aerial rootlets lay already  withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks. The stem of the  inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant, and the flowers were  growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals. The doctor stooped  towards it, then saw that one of the aerial rootlets still stirred feebly,  and hesitated.    The next morning the strange orchid still lay there, black now and  putrescent. The door banged intermittently in the morning breeze, and all  the array of Wedderburn's orchids was shrivelled and prostrate. But  Wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the glory of his  strange adventure.            V.      IN THE AVU OBSERVATORY.      The observatory at Avu, in Borneo, stands on the spur of the mountain. To  the north rises the old crater, black at night against the unfathomable  blue of the sky. From the little circular building, with its mushroom  dome, the slopes plunge steeply downward into the black mysteries of the  tropical forest beneath. The little house in which the observer and his  assistant live is about fifty yards from the observatory, and beyond this  are the huts of their native attendants.    Thaddy, the chief observer, was down with a slight fever. His assistant,  Woodhouse, paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical  night before commencing his solitary vigil. The night was very still. Now  and then voices and laughter came from the native huts, or the cry of some  strange animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the forest.  Nocturnal insects appeared in ghostly fashion out of the darkness, and  fluttered round his light. He thought, perhaps, of all the possibilities  of discovery that still lay in the black tangle beneath him; for to the  naturalist the virgin forests of Borneo are still a wonderland full of  strange questions and half-suspected discoveries. Woodhouse carried a  small lantern in his hand, and its yellow glow contrasted vividly with the  infinite series of tints between lavender-blue and black in which the  landscape was painted. His hands and face were smeared with ointment  against the attacks of the mosquitoes.    Even in these days of celestial photography, work done in a purely  temporary erection, and with only the most primitive appliances in  addition to the telescope, still involves a very large amount of cramped  and motionless watching. He sighed as he thought of the physical fatigues  before him, stretched himself, and entered the observatory.    The reader is probably familiar with the structure of an ordinary  astronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape,  with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from  the interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the  centre, and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth's rotation,  and allows a star once found to be continuously observed. Besides this,  there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its point of  support, by which the astronomer adjusts it. There is, of course, a slit  in the movable roof which follows the eye of the telescope in its survey  of the heavens. The observer sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement,  which he can wheel to any part of the observatory as the position of the  telescope may require. Within it is advisable to have things as dark as  possible, in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed.    The lantern flared as Woodhouse entered his circular den, and the general  darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine, from which it  presently seemed to creep back over the whole place again as the light  waned. The slit was a profound transparent blue, in which six stars shone  with tropical brilliance, and their light lay, a pallid gleam, along the  black tube of the instrument. Woodhouse shifted the roof, and then  proceeding to the telescope, turned first one wheel and then another, the  great cylinder slowly swinging into a new position. Then he glanced  through the finder, the little companion telescope, moved the roof a  little more, made some further adjustments, and set the clockwork in  motion. He took off his jacket, for the night was very hot, and pushed  into position the uncomfortable seat to which he was condemned for the  next four hours. Then with a sigh he resigned himself to his watch upon  the mysteries of space.    There was no sound now in the observatory, and the lantern waned steadily.  Outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm or pain, or  calling to its mate, and the intermittent sounds of the Malay and Dyak  servants. Presently one of the men began a queer chanting song, in which  the others joined at intervals. After this it would seem that they turned  in for the night, for no further sound came from their direction, and the  whispering stillness became more and more profound.    The clockwork ticked steadily. The shrill hum of a mosquito explored the  place and grew shriller in indignation at Woodhouse's ointment. Then the  lantern went out and all the observatory was black.    Woodhouse shifted his position presently, when the slow movement of the  telescope had carried it beyond the limits of his comfort.    He was watching a little group of stars in the Milky Way, in one of which  his chief had seen or fancied a remarkable colour variability. It was not  a part of the regular work for which the establishment existed, and for  that reason perhaps Woodhouse was deeply interested. He must have  forgotten things terrestrial. All his attention was concentrated upon the  great blue circle of the telescope field--a circle powdered, so it seemed,  with an innumerable multitude of stars, and all luminous against the  blackness of its setting. As he watched he seemed to himself to become  incorporeal, as if he too were floating in the ether of space. Infinitely  remote was the faint red spot he was observing.    Suddenly the stars were blotted out. A flash of blackness passed, and they  were visible again.    \"Queer,\" said Woodhouse. \"Must have been a bird.\"    The thing happened again, and immediately after the great tube shivered as  though it had been struck. Then the dome of the observatory resounded with  a series of thundering blows. The stars seemed to sweep aside as the  telescope--which had been unclamped--swung round and away from the slit in  the roof.    \"Great Scott!\" cried Woodhouse. \"What's this?\"    Some huge vague black shape, with a flapping something like a wing, seemed  to be struggling in the aperture of the roof. In another moment the slit  was clear again, and the luminous haze of the Milky Way shone warm and  bright.    The interior of the roof was perfectly black, and only a scraping sound  marked the whereabouts of the unknown creature.    Woodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet. He was trembling  violently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence. Was  the thing, whatever it was, inside or out? It was big, whatever else it  might be. Something shot across the skylight, and the telescope swayed. He  started violently and put his arm up. It was in the observatory, then,  with him. It was clinging to the roof apparently. What the devil was it?  Could it see him?    He stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupefaction. The beast,  whatever it was, clawed at the interior of the dome, and then something  flapped almost into his face, and he saw the momentary gleam of starlight  on a skin like oiled leather. His water-bottle was knocked off his little  table with a smash.    The sense of some strange bird-creature hovering a few yards from his face  in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to Woodhouse. As his thought  returned he concluded that it must be some night-bird or large bat. At any  risk he would see what it was, and pulling a match from his pocket, he  tried to strike it on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#9)"],[1,".\"    \"I have no objection, Adam--in fact, if I had, I should have to overcome  it.  I fear there can be no more reserved thoughts between us.\"    \"Indeed, sir, that sounds serious, worse than serious!\"    \"Adam, I greatly fear that the time has come for us--for you and me, at  all events--to speak out plainly to one another.  Does not there seem  something very mysterious about this?\"    \"I have thought so, sir, all along.  The only difficulty one has is what  one is to think and where to begin.\"    \"Let us begin with what you have told me.  First take the conduct of the  mongoose.  He was quiet, even friendly and affectionate with you.  He  only attacked the snakes, which is, after all, his business in life.\"    \"That is so!\"    \"Then we must try to find some reason why he attacked Lady Arabella.\"    \"May it not be that a mongoose may have merely the instinct to attack,  that nature does not allow or provide him with the fine reasoning powers  to discriminate who he is to attack?\"    \"Of course that may be so.  But, on the other hand, should we not satisfy  ourselves why he does wish to attack anything?  If for centuries, this  particular animal is known to attack only one kind of other animal, are  we not justified in assuming that when one of them attacks a hitherto  unclassed animal, he recognises in that animal some quality which it has  in common with the hereditary enemy?\"    \"That is a good argument, sir,\" Adam went on, \"but a dangerous one.  If  we followed it out, it would lead us to believe that Lady Arabella is a  snake.\"    \"We must be sure, before going to such an end, that there is no point as  yet unconsidered which would account for the unknown thing which puzzles  us.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"Well, suppose the instinct works on some physical basis--for instance,  smell.  If there were anything in recent juxtaposition to the attacked  which would carry the scent, surely that would supply the missing cause.\"    \"Of course!\" Adam spoke with conviction.    \"Now, from what you tell me, the negro had just come from the direction  of Diana's Grove, carrying the dead snakes which the mongoose had killed  the previous morning.  Might not the scent have been carried that way?\"    \"Of course it might, and probably was.  I never thought of that.  Is  there any possible way of guessing approximately how long a scent will  remain?  You see, this is a natural scent, and may derive from a place  where it has been effective for thousands of years.  Then, does a scent  of any kind carry with it any form or quality of another kind, either  good or evil?  I ask you because one ancient name of the house lived in  by the lady who was attacked by the mongoose was 'The Lair of the White  Worm.'  If any of these things be so, our difficulties have multiplied  indefinitely.  They may even change in kind.  We may get into moral  entanglements; before we know it, we may be in the midst of a struggle  between good and evil.\"    Sir Nathaniel smiled gravely.    \"With regard to the first question--so far as I know, there are no fixed  periods for which a scent may be active--I think we may take it that that  period does not run into thousands of years.  As to whether any moral  change accompanies a physical one, I can only say that I have met no  proof of the fact.  At the same time, we must remember that 'good' and  'evil' are terms so wide as to take in the whole scheme of creation, and  all that is implied by them and by their mutual action and reaction.  Generally, I would say that in the scheme of a First Cause anything is  possible.  So long as the inherent forces or tendencies of any one thing  are veiled from us we must expect mystery.\"    \"There is one other question on which I should like to ask your opinion.  Suppose that there are any permanent forces appertaining to the past,  what we may call 'survivals,' do these belong to good as well as to evil?  For instance, if the scent of the primaeval monster can so remain in  proportion to the original strength, can the same be true of things of  good import?\"    Sir Nathaniel thought for a while before he answered.    \"We must be careful not to confuse the physical and the moral.  I can see  that already you have switched on the moral entirely, so perhaps we had  better follow it up first.  On the side of the moral, we have certain  justification for belief in the utterances of revealed religion.  For  instance, 'the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much'  is altogether for good.  We have nothing of a similar kind on the side of  evil.  But if we accept this dictum we need have no more fear of  'mysteries': these become thenceforth merely obstacles.\"    Adam suddenly changed to another phase of the subject.    \"And now, sir, may I turn for a few minutes to purely practical things,  or rather to matters of historical fact?\"    Sir Nathaniel bowed acquiescence.    \"We have already spoken of the history, so far as it is known, of some of  the places round us--'Castra Regis,' 'Diana's Grove,' and 'The Lair of  the White Worm.'  I would like to ask if there is anything not  necessarily of evil import about any of the places?\"    \"Which?\" asked Sir Nathaniel shrewdly.    \"Well, for instance, this house and Mercy Farm?\"    \"Here we turn,\" said Sir Nathaniel, \"to the other side, the light side of  things.  Let us take Mercy Farm first.  When Augustine was sent by Pope  Gregory to Christianise England, in the time of the Romans, he was  received and protected by Ethelbert, King of Kent, whose wife, daughter  of Charibert, King of Paris, was a Christian, and did much for Augustine.  She founded a nunnery in memory of Columba, which was named _Sedes  misericordioe_, the House of Mercy, and, as the region was Mercian, the  two names became involved.  As Columba is the Latin for dove, the dove  became a sort of signification of the nunnery.  She seized on the idea  and made the newly-founded nunnery a house of doves.  Someone sent her a  freshly-discovered dove, a sort of carrier, but which had in the white  feathers of its head and neck the form of a religious cowl.  The nunnery  flourished for more than a century, when, in the time of Penda, who was  the reactionary of heathendom, it fell into decay.  In the meantime the  doves, protected by religious feeling, had increased mightily, and were  known in all Catholic communities.  When King Offa ruled in Mercia, about  a hundred and fifty years later, he restored Christianity, and under its  protection the nunnery of St. Columba was restored and its doves  flourished again.  In process of time this religious house again fell  into desuetude; but before it disappeared it had achieved a great name  for good works, and in especial for the piety of its members.  If deeds  and prayers and hopes and earnest thinking leave anywhere any moral  effect, Mercy Farm and all around it have almost the right to be  considered holy ground.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Adam earnestly, and was silent.  Sir Nathaniel  understood.    After lunch that day, Adam casually asked Sir Nathaniel to come for a  walk with him.  The keen-witted old diplomatist guessed that there must  be some motive behind the suggestion, and he at once agreed.    As soon as they were free from observation, Adam began.    \"I am afraid, sir, that there is more going on in this neighbourhood than  most people imagine.  I was out this morning, and on the edge of the  small wood, I came upon the body of a child by the roadside.  At first, I  thought she was dead, and while examining her, I noticed on her neck some  marks that looked like those of teeth.\"    \"Some wild dog, perhaps?\" put in Sir Nathaniel.    \"Possibly, sir, though I think not--but listen to the rest of my news.  I  glanced around, and to my surprise, I noticed something white moving  among the trees.  I placed the child down carefully, and followed, but I  could not find any further traces.  So I returned to the child and  resumed my examination, and, to my delight, I discovered that she was  still alive.  I chafed her hands and gradually she revived, but to my  disappointment she remembered nothing--except that something had crept up  quietly from behind, and had gripped her round the throat.  Then,  apparently, she fainted.\"    \"Gripped her round the throat!  Then it cannot have been a dog.\"    \"No, sir, that is my difficulty, and explains why I brought you out here,  where we cannot possibly be overheard.  You have noticed, of course, the  peculiar sinuous way in which Lady Arabella moves--well, I feel certain  that the white thing that I saw in the wood was the mistress of Diana's  Grove!\"    \"Good God, boy, be careful what you say.\"    \"Yes, sir, I fully realise the gravity of my accusation, but I feel  convinced that the marks on the child's throat were human--and made by a  woman.\"    Adam's companion remained silent for some time, deep in thought.    \"Adam, my boy,\" he said at last, \"this matter appears to me to be far  more serious even than you think.  It forces me to break confidence with  my old friend, your uncle--but, in order to spare him, I must do so.  For  some time now, things have been happening in this district that have been  worrying him dreadfully--several people have disappeared, without leaving  the slightest trace; a dead child was found by the roadside, with no  visible or ascertainable cause of death--sheep and other animals have  been found in the fields, bleeding from open wounds.  There have been  other matters--many of them apparently trivial in themselves.  Some  sinister influence has been at work, and I admit that I have suspected  Lady Arabella--that is why I questioned you so closely about the mongoose  and its strange attack upon Lady Arabella.  You will think it strange  that I should suspect the mistress of Diana's Grove, a beautiful woman of  aristocratic birth.  Let me explain--the family seat is near my own  place, Doom Tower, and at one time I knew"]]]
