And the bear was walking towards the man, very  slowly because his wound irked him--yet he was now very close. And  what the captain did he would not say, but every year as soon as the  snows are hard, and travelling is easy on the Hian Min, that man comes  down to the market in the plains, and always leaves for the captain in  the gate of fair Belzoond a vessel of that priceless secret wine.    And as I sipped the wine and the captain talked, I remembered me of  stalwart noble things that I had long since resolutely planned, and my  soul seemed to grow mightier within me and to dominate the whole tide  of the Yann. It may be that I then slept. Or, if I did not, I do not  now minutely recollect every detail of that morning's occupations.  Towards evening, I awoke and wishing to see Perdondaris before we left  in the morning, and being unable to wake the captain, I went ashore  alone. Certainly Perdondaris was a powerful city; it was encompassed  by a wall of great strength and altitude, having in it hollow ways for  troops to walk in, and battlements along it all the way, and fifteen  strong towers on it in every mile, and copper plaques low down where  men could read them, telling in all the languages of those parts of  the Earth--one language on each plaque--the tale of how an army once  attacked Perdondaris and what befell that army. Then I entered  Perdondaris and found all the people dancing, clad in brilliant silks,  and playing on the tam-bang as they danced. For a fearful thunderstorm  had terrified them while I slept, and the fires of death, they said,  had danced over Perdondaris, and now the thunder had gone leaping away  large and black and hideous, they said, over the distant hills, and  had turned round snarling at them, showing his gleaming teeth, and had  stamped, as he went, upon the hilltops until they rang as though they  had been bronze. And often and again they stopped in their merry  dances and prayed to the God they knew not, saying, \"O, God that we  know not, we thank Thee for sending the thunder back to his hills.\"  And I went on and came to the market-place, and lying there upon the  marble pavement I saw the merchant fast asleep and breathing heavily,  with his face and the palms of his hands towards the sky, and slaves  were fanning him to keep away the flies. And from the market-place I  came to a silver temple and then to a palace of onyx, and there were  many wonders in Perdondaris, and I would have stayed and seen them  all, but as I came to the outer wall of the city I suddenly saw in it  a huge ivory gate. For a while I paused and admired it, then I came  nearer and perceived the dreadful truth. The gate was carved out of  one solid piece!    I fled at once through the gateway and down to the ship, and even as I  ran I thought that I heard far off on the hills behind me the tramp of  the fearful beast by whom that mass of ivory was shed, who was perhaps  even then looking for his other tusk. When I was on the ship again I  felt safer, and I said nothing to the sailors of what I had seen.    And now the captain was gradually awakening. Now night was rolling up  from the East and North, and only the pinnacles of the towers of  Perdondaris still took the fallen sunlight. Then I went to the captain  and told him quietly of the thing I had seen. And he questioned me at  once about the gate, in a low voice, that the sailors might not know;  and I told him how the weight of the thing was such that it could not  have been brought from afar, and the captain knew that it had not been  there a year ago. We agreed that such a beast could never have been  killed by any assault of man, and that the gate must have been a  fallen tusk, and one fallen near and recently. Therefore he decided  that it were better to flee at once; so he commanded, and the sailors  went to the sails, and others raised the anchor to the deck, and just  as the highest pinnacle of marble lost the last rays of the sun we  left Perdondaris, that famous city. And night came down and cloaked  Perdondaris and hid it from our eyes, which as things have happened  will never see it again; for I have heard since that something swift  and wonderful has suddenly wrecked Perdondaris in a day--towers, and  walls, and people.    And the night deepened over the River Yann, a night all white with  stars. And with the night there arose the helmsman's song. As soon as  he had prayed he began to sing to cheer himself all through the lonely  night. But first he prayed, praying the helmsman's prayer. And this is  what I remember of it, rendered into English with a very feeble  equivalent of the rhythm that seemed so resonant in those tropic  nights        To whatever god may hear.        Wherever there be sailors whether of river or sea: whether their      way be dark or whether through storm: whether their perils be of      beast or of rock: or from enemy lurking on land or pursuing on sea:      wherever the tiller is cold or the helmsman stiff: wherever sailors      sleep or helmsman watch: guard, guide, and return us to the old      land, that has known us: to the far homes that we know.        To all the gods that are.        To whatever god may hear.    So he prayed, and there was silence. And the sailors laid them down to  rest for the night. The silence deepened, and was only broken by the  ripples of Yann that lightly touched our prow. Sometimes some monster  of the river coughed.    Silence and ripples, ripples and silence again.    And then his loneliness came upon the helmsman, and he began to sing.  And he sang the market songs of Durl and Duz, and the old  dragon-legends of Belzoond.    Many a song he sang, telling to spacious and exotic Yann the little  tales and trifles of his city of Durl. And the songs welled up over  the black jungle and came into the clear cold air above, and the great  bands of stars that looked on Yann began to know the affairs of Durl  and Duz, and of the shepherds that dwelt in the fields between, and  the flocks that they had, and the loves that they had loved, and all  the little things that they hoped to do. And as I lay wrapped up in  skins and blankets listening to those songs, and watching the  fantastic shapes of the great trees like to black giants stalking  through the night, I suddenly fell asleep.    When I awoke great mists were trailing away from the Yann. And the  flow of the river was tumbling now tumultuously, and little waves  appeared; for Yann had scented from afar the ancient crags of Glorm,  and knew that their ravines lay cool before him wherein he should meet  the merry wild Irillion rejoicing from fields of snow. So he shook off  from him the torpid sleep that had come upon him in the hot and  scented jungle, and forgot its orchids and its butterflies, and swept  on turbulent, expectant, strong; and soon the snowy peaks of the Hills  of Glorm came glittering into view. And now the sailors were waking up  from sleep. Soon we all ate, and then the helmsman laid him down to  sleep while a comrade took his place, and they all spread over him  their choicest furs.    And in a while we heard the sound that the Irillion made as she came  down dancing from the fields of snow.    And then we saw the ravine in the Hills of Glorm lying precipitous and  smooth before us, into which we were carried by the leaps of Yann. And  now we left the steamy jungle and breathed the mountain air; the  sailors stood up and took deep breaths of it, and thought of their own  far-off Acroctian hills on which were Durl and Duz--below them in the  plains stands fair Belzoond.    A great shadow brooded between the cliffs of Glorm, but the crags were  shining above us like gnarled moons, and almost lit the gloom. Louder  and louder came the Irillion's song, and the sound of her dancing down  from the fields of snow. And soon we saw her white and full of mists,  and wreathed with rainbows delicate and small that she had plucked up  near the mountain's summit from some celestial garden of the Sun. Then  she went away seawards with the huge grey Yann and the ravine widened,  and opened upon the world, and our rocking ship came through to the  light of day.    And all that morning and all the afternoon we passed through the  marshes of Pondoovery; and Yann widened there, and flowed solemnly and  slowly, and the captain bade the sailors beat on bells to overcome the  dreariness of the marshes.    At last the Irusian Mountains came in sight, nursing the villages of  Pen-Kai and Blut, and the wandering streets of Mlo, where priests  propitiate the avalanche with wine and maize. Then the night came down  over the plains of Tlun, and we saw the lights of Cappadarnia. We  heard the Pathnites beating upon drums as we passed Imaut and  Golzunda, then all but the helmsman slept. And villages scattered  along the banks of the Yann heard all that night in the helmsman's  unknown tongue the little songs of cities that they know not.    I awoke before dawn with a feeling that I was unhappy before I  remembered why. Then I recalled that by the evening of the approaching  day, according to all forseen probabilities, we should come to  Bar-Wul-Yann, and I should part from the captain and his sailors. And I  had liked the man because he had given me of his yellow wine that was  set apart among his sacred things, and many a story he had told me  about his fair Belzoond between the Acrotian hills and the Hian Min.  And I had liked the ways that his sailors had, and the prayers that  they prayed at evening side by side, grudging not one another their  alien gods. And I had a liking too for the tender way in which they  often spoke of Durl and Duz, for it is good that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#9)"],[1," that, I have no distinct recollection. All was submerged by that one  picture, and quickly buried by the activities into which I was immediately  plunged. I do not recall the length of time we were held on board for  medical inspection, nor whether the customs inspection was on board or  ashore. I recall the trip from the ship to the wharf, in one of the little  sailboats then used for the purpose, rather because of later experiences  than because of the first one. I have no purpose here to write a history  of those busy days, filled as they were with absorbing interest, with much  that was pathetic and not a little that was amusing. I have seen that  morning picture many times since, but never less beautiful, never less  impressive. Nowadays, it is lost to most travellers because the crossing  from Key West is made in the daytime, the boat reaching Havana in the  late-afternoon. Sometimes there is a partial compensation in the sunset  picture, but I have never seen that when it really rivalled the picture at  the beginning of the day.    The visitor to Cuba, unfamiliar with the island, should take it leisurely.  It is not a place through which the tourist may rush, guide book in hand,  making snapshots with a camera, and checking off places of interest as they  are visited. Picturesqueness and quaintness are not at all lacking, but  there are no noble cathedrals, no vast museums of art and antiquity, no  snow-clad mountains. There is a charm of light and shade and color that  is to be absorbed slowly rather than swallowed at a single gulp. It is  emphatically a place in which to dawdle. Let those who are obliged to do  so, work and hurry; the visitor and the traveller should take it without  haste. It is far better to see Havana and its vicinity slowly and  enjoyably, and look at pictures of the rest of the country, than it is to  rush through the island merely for the sake of doing so. In his essay on  _The Moral of Landscape_, Mr. Ruskin said that \"all travelling becomes dull  in exact proportion to its rapidity.\" Nowhere is that more true than it  is in Cuba. There is very little in all the island that cannot be seen in  Havana and its immediate vicinity. It is well to see the other places if  one has ample time, but they should not be seen at the expense of a proper  enjoyment of Havana and its neighborhood. In Havana are buildings as old  and buildings as beautiful as any in the island. In its vicinity are sugar  plantations, tobacco fields, pineapples, cocoanuts, mangoes, royal palms,  ceibas, peasants' homes, typical towns and villages, all the life of the  people in the city and country. The common American desire to \"see it all\"  in a few days, is fatal to the greatest enjoyment, and productive mainly  of physical fatigue and mental confusion. It is the misfortune of most  travellers that they carry with them only the vaguest of ideas of what they  want to see. They have heard of Cuba, of Havana, the Morro, the Prado, of a  sunny island in the midst of a sapphire sea. While it is true that almost  everything in Cuba is worth seeing, it is best to acquire, before going,  some idea of the exhibition. That saves time and many steps. The old city  wall, La Fuerza, and La Punta, are mere piles of masonry, more or less dull  and uninteresting unless one knows something of their history. The manners  and customs of any country become increasingly interesting if one knows  something about them, the reason for them.    It is only a short trip to the Castillo del Principe, the fortress that  crowns the hill to the west of the city. From that height, the city and the  harbor are seen below, to the eastward. Across the bay, on the heights at  the entrance, are the frowning walls of Morro Castle surmounted by the  towering light-house, and the no less grim walls of La Cabana. The  bay itself is a sprawling, shapeless body of water with a narrow neck  connecting it with the Florida Straits. Into the western side of the bay  the city thrusts itself in a shape that, on a large map, suggests more than  anything else the head and neck of an over-fed bulldog. Into this bay, in  1508, came Sebastian Ocampo, said to be the first white man to visit the  spot. He entered for the purpose of careening his little vessels in order  to remove the barnacles and accumulated weed-growth. It is possible that  the spot was discovered earlier, but there is no record of the discovery  if such was made. Ocampo gave it the name of Puerto de Carenas. The next  record is of its occupation, in 1519. Four years earlier, Diego Velasquez  had left a little colony near what is now called Batabano, on the south  coast. He gave the place the name of San Cristobal de la Habana, in memory  of the illustrious navigator and discoverer. Habana, or Havana, is a term  of aboriginal origin. It proved to be an uncomfortable place of residence,  and in 1519 the people moved across the island to the Puerto de Carenas,  taking with them the name given to the earlier settlement, and substituting  it for the name given by Ocampo. After a time, all was dropped except the  present title, Habana, or more commonly by English-speaking people, Havana.  It was not much of a place for a number of years, but in 1538 it was sacked  and burned by a French pirate, one of the many, of different nations, who  carried on a very lively buccaneering business in those and in later years  in West Indian waters. Hernando de Soto was then governor of the island,  with headquarters at the then capital city, Santiago de Cuba. He proceeded  at once to the scene of destruction. On his arrival, he ordered the  erection of a fortress. Some of the work then done still remains in the  old structure near the Palace, at the foot of Calle O'Reilly, known as La  Fuerza. A few years before this time, Hernan Cortes had conquered Mexico,  then called New Spain, and a business between Old Spain and New Spain soon  developed. The harbor of Havana made a convenient halting-place on the  voyages between the two, and the settlement assumed a steadily increasing  importance. A new governor, Gonzales Perez de Angulo, who arrived in 1549,  decided to make it his place of residence. The year 1552 is generally given  as the time of the creation of Havana as the capital city. It was at that  time made the residence city of the Governors, by their own choice, but  it was not officially established as the capital until 1589. The fortress  erected by order of de Soto proved somewhat ineffective. In 1554, another  French marauder attacked and destroyed the town. The principal industry of  those early days was cattle-raising, a considerable market being developed  for export to Mexico, and for the supply of vessels that entered the harbor  for food and water.    The continuance of incursions by pirates made necessary some further  provision for the defence of the city. In 1589, La Fuerza was enlarged and  strengthened, and the construction of Morro Castle was begun. To this  work was added La Punta, the little fortress on the western shore of  the entrance, at the point of the angle now formed by the Prado and the  Malecon. These ancient structures, of practically no value whatever in  modern warfare, are now among the most picturesque points of interest in  the neighborhood. Another, in the same class, of which only a little now  remains, is of a later time. This is the old city wall, the construction  of which was begun in 1671. Following the simile of the bull-dog's head,  a tract of land, formerly known as the Arsenal yard, and now the central  railway station, lies tucked away immediately under the animal's jaw. From  there to a point on the north shore, near La Punta, in a slightly curving  line, a high wall was erected for the purpose of defence on the western  or landward side. The old city lay entirely in the area defined by this  western wall and the shore of the harbor. At intervals, gates afforded exit  to the country beyond, heavy gates that could be closed to exclude any  possible attacking party. The fortifications erected from time to time were  supposed to afford a system of effective defence for the city. They are now  little else than picturesque features in the landscape, points of interest  for visitors. Taking the chain in its order, El Morro stands on the point  on the eastern side of the entrance to the harbor. Just beyond it is La  Cabana. About a half a mile to the east of this was the stone fort on the  hill of San Diego. Three miles east of the Morro, on the shore at Cojimar,  is a small and somewhat ancient fortification. This group constituted the  defence system on the east. At the head of the bay, on an elevation a  little to the south of the city, stands El Castillo de Atares, begun in  1763, immediately after the capture and occupation of the city by the  British. This is supposed to protect the city on the south, as Castillo del  Principe is supposed to defend it on the west. This stands on a hill on  the western outskirts, a somewhat extensive structure, begun in 1774 and  completed about twenty years later. A little further to the west, at the  mouth of the Almendares river, stands a little fort, or tower, called  Chorrera, serving as a western outpost as Cojimar serves as an eastern  outpost. Both were erected about the year 1650. On the shore generally  north of Principe was the Santa Clara battery, and between that and La  Punta, at the foot of the Calzada de Belascoain, stood the Queen's battery.  From any modern point of view, the system is little more than military  junk, better fitted for its present use as barracks, asylums, and prisons  than for military defence. But it is all highly picturesque.    In the beginning, most of the buildings of the city were doubtless of wood,  with palm-thatched roofs. In time, these gave place to rows of abutting  stone buildings with tiled roofs. Most of them were of one story, some were  of two stories, and a few \"palaces\" had"]]]
