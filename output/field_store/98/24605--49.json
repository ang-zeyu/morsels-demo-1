For Livia had carefully beset the  palace, and all the avenues to it, with detachments of the guards; and  good news of his recovery were from time to time given out. When she had  taken all measures necessary in so great a conjuncture, in one and the  same moment was published the departure of Augustus, and the accession  of Tiberius.    The first feat of this new reign was the murder of young Agrippa: the  assassin, a bold and determined Centurion, found him destitute of arms,  and little apprehending such a destiny, yet was scarce able to despatch  him. Of this transaction Tiberius avoided any mention in the Senate: he  would have it pass for done by the commands of Augustus; as if he had  transmitted written orders to the Tribune, who guarded Agrippa, \"to slay  him the instant he heard of his grandfather's decease.\" It is very true  that Augustus had made many and vehement complaints of the young man's  obstinate and unruly demeanour, and even solicited from the Senate  a decree to authorise his banishment: but he never hardened himself  against the sentiments of nature, nor in any instance dipped his hands  in his own blood; neither is it credible that he would barbarously  sacrifice the life of his grandson for the security and establishment of  his step-son. More probable it is, that this hasty murder was purely the  work of Tiberius and Livia; that the young Prince, hated and dreaded  by both, fell thus untimely, to rid the one of his apprehensions and  a rival, and to satiate in the other the rancorous spirit of a  step-mother. When the Centurion, according to the custom of the army,  acquainted Tiberius, \"that his commands were executed;\" he answered, \"he  had commanded no such execution, and the Centurion must appear before  the Senate, and for it be answerable to them.\" This alarmed Sallustius  Crispus, who shared in all his secret counsels, and had sent the  Centurion the warrant: he dreaded that he should be arraigned for the  assassination, and knew it equally perilous either to confess the truth,  and charge the Emperor; or falsely to clear the Emperor, and accuse  himself. Hence he had recourse to Livia, and warned her, \"never to  divulge the secrets of the palace, never to expose to public examination  the ministers who advised, nor the soldiers who executed: Tiberius  should beware of relaxing the authority of the Prince, by referring all  things to that of the Senate; since it was the indispensable prerogative  of sovereignty for all men to be accountable only to one.\"    Now at Rome, Consuls, Senators, and Roman Knights, were all rushing  with emulation into bondage, and the higher the quality of each the more  false and forward the men; all careful so to frame their faces, as to  reconcile false joy for the accession of Tiberius, with feigned sadness  for the loss of Augustus: hence they intermingled fears with gladness,  wailings with gratulations, and all with servile flattery. Sextus  Pompeius and Sextus Apuleius, at that time Consuls, took first the oath  of fidelity to Tiberius; then administered it to Seius Strabo and  Caius Turranius; the former Captain of the Praetorian Guards, the other  Intendant of the Public Stores. The oath was next given to the Senate,  to the people, and to the soldiery: all by the same Consuls; for  Tiberius affected to derive all public transactions from the legal  ministry of the Consuls, as if the ancient Republic still subsisted, and  he were yet unresolved about embracing the sovereign rule: he even owned  in his edict for summoning the Senate, that he issued it by virtue of  the Tribunitial power, granted him under Augustus. The edict, too,  was short and unexceptionably modest. It imported that, \"they were to  consider of the funeral honours proper to be paid his deceased Father:  for himself he would not depart from the corpse; and further than this  edict implied, he claimed no share in the public administration.\" Yet  from the moment Augustus was dead, he usurped all the prerogatives of  imperial state, gave the word to the Praetorian Cohorts; had soldiers  about the palace, guards about his person, went guarded in the street,  guarded to the Senate, and bore all the marks of Majesty: nay, he writ  letters to the several armies in the undisguised style of one already  their Prince: nor did he ever hesitate in expression, or speak with  perplexity, but when he spoke to the Senate. The chief cause of his  obscurity there proceeded from his fear of Germanicus: he dreaded that  he, who was master of so many legions, of numberless auxiliaries, and  of all the allies of Rome; he, who was the darling of the people, might  wish rather to possess the Empire, than to wait for it; he likewise, in  this mysterious way of dealing with the Senate, sought false glory, and  would rather seem by the Commonwealth chosen and called to the Empire,  than to have crept darkly into it by the intrigues of a woman, or by  adoption from a superannuated Prince. It was also afterwards found, that  by this abstruseness and counterfeit irresolution he meant to penetrate  into the designs and inclinations of the great men: for his jealous  spirit construed all their words, all their looks, into crimes; and  stored them up in his heart against a day of vengeance.    When he first met the Senate, he would bear no other business to be  transacted but that about the funeral of Augustus. His last will  was brought in by the Vestal Virgins: in it Tiberius and Livia were  appointed his heirs, Livia adopted into the Julian family, and dignified  with the name of Augusta: into the next and second degree of heirship he  adopted his grandchildren and their children; and in the third degree  he named the great men of Rome, most of them hated by him, but out of  vainglory he named them, and for future renown. His legacies were not  beyond the usual bounds; only he left to the Roman people four hundred  thousand great sesterces, [Footnote: L362,500.] to the populace or  common sort, thirty-five thousand; to every common soldier of the  Praetorian Guards, a thousand small sesterces, [Footnote: L8, 6s. 8d.]  and to every soldier of the Roman legions three hundred. [Footnote: L2,  10s.] The funeral honours were next considered. The chief proposed were  these: Asinius Gallus moved that \"the funeral should pass through the  Triumphal Gate:\" Lucius Arruntius, \"that the titles of all the laws  which he had made, and the names of all the nations which he had  conquered, should be carried before the corpse:\" Valerius Messala added,  that \"the oath of allegiance to Tiberius should be renewed every year;\"  and being asked by Tiberius, \"whether at his instigation he had made  that motion?\" \"I spoke it as my opinion,\" says Messala; \"nor will I ever  be determined by any but my own, in things which concern the commonweal;  let who will be provoked by my freedom.\" Only this new turn was wanting  to complete the prevailing flattery of the time. The Senators then  concurred in a loud cry, \"that upon their own shoulders they must bear  the body to the pile.\" But Tiberius declined the offer from an arrogant  show of moderation. Moreover, he cautioned the people by an edict, \"not  to disturb the funeral functions with a zeal over-passionate, as they  had those of Julius Caesar; nor to insist that the corpse of Augustus  should be burnt rather in the Forum, than in the field of Mars, which  was the place appointed.\" On the funeral day the soldiers under arms  kept guard; a mighty mockery this to those who had either seen, or heard  their fathers describe, the day when Caesar the Dictator was slain:  servitude was then new, its sorrows yet fresh and bitter; and liberty  unsuccessfully retrieved by a deed which, while it seemed impious to  some, was thought altogether glorious by others, and hence tore Rome  into tumults and the violence of parties: they who knew that turbulent  day, and compared it with the quiet exit of Augustus, ridiculed the  foppery of \"calling an aid of soldiers to secure a peaceable burial to a  Prince who had grown old in peace and power, and even provided against a  relapse into liberty, by a long train of successors.\"    Hence much and various matter of observation concerning Augustus: the  superstitious multitude admired the fortuitous events of his fortune;  \"that the last day of his life, and the first of his reign, was the  same; that he died at Nola, in the same village, and in the same house,  and in the same chamber, where his father Octavius died. They observed  to his glory, his many Consulships, equal in number to those of Valerius  Corvinus and of Caius Marius, joined together; that he had exercised the  power of the Tribuneship seven-and-thirty continued years: that he was  one-and-twenty times proclaimed Imperator; with many other numerous  honours repeated to him, or created for him.\" Men of deeper discernment  entered further into his life, but differed about it. His admirers said,  \"that his filial piety to his father Caesar, and the distractions of the  Republic, where the laws no longer governed, had driven him into a civil  war; which, whatever be the first cause, can never be begun or carried,  on by just and gentle means.\" Indeed, to be revenged on the murderers of  his father, he had made many great sacrifices to the violent genius  of Anthony; many to Lepidus: but when Lepidus was become sunk and  superannuated in sloth; when Anthony was lost headlong in sensuality,  there was then no other remedy for the distracted State, rent piecemeal  by its Chiefs, but the sovereignty of one: Augustus, however, never  had assumed to be over his country King, or Dictator; but settled the  government under the legal name of Prince, or Chief of the Senate: he  had extended the Empire, and set for its bounds the distant ocean  and rivers far remote; the several parts and forces of the State, the  legions, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#8)"],[1,"regions of the globe. At the beginning of historic times, however,  civilization was confined within a narrow area--the river valleys of  western Asia and Egypt. The uncounted centuries before the dawn of history  make up the prehistoric period, when savagery and barbarism prevailed  throughout the world. Our knowledge of it is derived from the examination  of the objects found in caves, refuse mounds, graves, and other sites.  Various European countries, including England, France, Denmark,  Switzerland, and Italy, are particularly rich in prehistoric remains.    [Illustration: A PREHISTORIC EGYPTIAN GRAVE  The skeleton lay on the left side, with knees drawn up and hands raised to  the head. About it were various articles of food and vessels of pottery.]    THE TWO AGES    The prehistoric period is commonly divided, according to the character of  the materials used for tools and weapons, into the Age of Stone and the  Age of Metals. The one is the age of savagery; the other is the age of  barbarism or semicivilization.    THE STONE AGE    Man's earliest implements were those that lay ready to his hand. A branch  from a tree served as a spear; a thick stick in his strong arms became a  powerful club. Later, perhaps, came the use of a hard stone such as flint,  which could be chipped into the forms of arrowheads, axes, and spear tips.  The first stone implements were so rude in shape that it is difficult to  believe them of human workmanship. They may have been made several hundred  thousand years ago. After countless centuries of slow advance, savages  learned to fasten wooden handles to their stone tools and weapons and also  to use such materials as jade and granite, which could be ground and  polished into a variety of forms. Stone implements continued to be made  during the greater part of the prehistoric period. Every region of the  world has had a Stone Age. [1] Its length is reckoned, not by centuries,  but by milleniums.    [Illustration: A HATCHET OF THE EARLY STONE AGE  A hatchet of flint, probably used without a helve and intended to fit the  hand. Similar implements have been found all over the world, except in  Australia.]    [Illustration: ARROWHEADS OF THE LATER STONE AGE  Different forms from Europe, Africa, and North America.]    THE AGE OF METALS    The Age of Metals, compared with its predecessor, covers a brief expanse  of time. The use of metals came in not much before the dawn of history.  The earliest civilized peoples, the Babylonians and Egyptians, when we  first become acquainted with them, appear to be passing from the use of  stone implements to those of metal.    COPPER    Copper was the first metal in common use. The credit for the invention of  copper tools seems to belong to the Egyptians. At a very early date they  were working the copper mines on the peninsula of Sinai. The Babylonians  probably obtained their copper from the same region. Another source of  this metal was the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean. The  Greek name of the island means \"copper.\"    BRONZE    But copper tools were soft and would not keep an edge. Some ancient smith,  more ingenious than his fellows, discovered that the addition of a small  part of tin to the copper produced a new metal--bronze--harder than the  old, yet capable of being molded into a variety of forms. At least as  early as 3000 B.C. we find bronze taking the place of copper in both Egypt  and Babylonia. Somewhat later bronze was introduced into the island of  Crete, then along the eastern coast of Greece, and afterwards into other  European countries.    IRON    The introduction of iron occurred in comparatively recent times. At first  it was a scarce, and therefore a very precious, metal. The Egyptians seem  to have made little use of iron before 1500 B.C. They called it \"the metal  of heaven,\" as if they obtained it from meteorites. In the Greek Homeric  poems, composed about 900 B.C. or later, we find iron considered so  valuable that a lump of it is one of the chief prizes at athletic games.  In the first five books of the Bible iron is mentioned only thirteen  times, though copper and bronze are referred to forty-four times. Iron is  more difficult to work than either copper or bronze, but it is vastly  superior to those metals in hardness and durability. Hence it gradually  displaced them throughout the greater part of the Old World. [2]    FIRST STEPS TOWARD CIVILIZATION    During the prehistoric period early man came to be widely scattered  throughout the world. Here and there, slowly, and with utmost difficulty,  he began to take the first steps toward civilization. The tools and  weapons which he left behind him afford some evidence of his advance. We  may now single out some of his other great achievements and follow their  development to the dawn of history.      3. DOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS    HUNTING AND FISHING STAGE    Prehistoric man lived at first chiefly on wild berries, nuts, roots, and  herbs. As his implements improved and his skill increased, he became  hunter, trapper, and fisher. A tribe of hunters, however, requires an  extensive territory and a constant supply of game. When the wild animals  are all killed or seriously reduced in number, privation and hardship  result. It was a forward step, therefore, when man began to tame animals  as well as to kill them.    DOMESTICATION OF THE DOG    The dog was man's first conquest over the animal kingdom. As early as the  Age of Metals various breeds appear, such as deerhounds, sheep dogs, and  mastiffs. The dog soon showed how useful he could be. He tracked game,  guarded the camp, and later, in the pastoral stage, protected flocks and  herds against their enemies.    THE COW    The cow also was domesticated at a remote period. No other animal has been  more useful to mankind. The cow's flesh and milk supply food: the skin  provides clothing; the sinews, bones, and horns yield materials for  implements. The ox was early trained to bear the yoke and draw the plow,  as we may learn from ancient Egyptian paintings. [3] Cattle have also been  commonly used as a kind of money. The early Greeks, whose wealth consisted  chiefly of their herds, priced a slave at twenty oxen, a suit of armor at  one hundred oxen, and so on. The early Romans reckoned values in cattle  (one ox being equivalent to ten sheep). Our English word \"pecuniary\" goes  back to the Latin _pecus_, or \"herd\" of cattle.    [Illustration: EARLY ROMAN BAR MONEY  A bar of copper marked with the figure of a bull. Dates from the fourth  century B.C.]    THE HORSE    The domestication of the horse came much later than that of the cow. In  the early Stone Age the horse ran wild over western Europe and formed an  important source of food for primitive men. This prehistoric horse, as  some ancient drawings show, [4] was a small animal with a shaggy mane and  tail. It resembled the wild pony still found on the steppes of Mongolia.  The domesticated horse does not appear in Egypt and western Asia much  before 1500 B.C. For a long time after the horse was tamed, the more  manageable ox continued to be used as the beast of burden. The horse was  kept for chariots of war, as among the Egyptians, or ridden bareback in  races, as by the early Greeks.    OTHER ANIMALS DOMESTICATED    At the close of prehistoric times in the Old World nearly all the domestic  animals of to-day were known. Besides those just mentioned, the goat,  sheep, ass, and hog had become man's useful servants. [5]    PASTORAL STAGE    The domestication of animals made possible an advance from the hunting and  fishing stage to the pastoral stage. Herds of cattle and sheep would now  furnish more certain and abundant supplies of food than the chase could  ever yield. We find in some parts of the world, as on the great Asiatic  plains, the herdsman succeeding the hunter and fisher. But even in this  stage much land for grazing is required. With the exhaustion of the  pasturage the sheep or cattle must be driven to new fields. Hence pastoral  peoples, as well as hunting and fishing folk, remained nomads without  fixed homes. Before permanent settlements were possible, another onward  step became necessary. This was the domestication of plants.    AGRICULTURAL STAGE    The domestication of plants marked almost as wonderful an advance as the  domestication of animals. When wild seedgrasses and plants had been  transformed into the great cereals--wheat, oats, barley, and rice--people  could raise them for food, and so could pass from the life of wandering  hunters or shepherds to the life of settled farmers. There is evidence  that during the Stone Age some of the inhabitants of Europe were familiar  with various cultivated plants, but agriculture on a large scale seems to  have begun in the fertile regions of Egypt and western Asia. [6] Here  first arose populous communities with leisure to develop the arts of life.  Here, as has been already seen, [7] we must look for the beginnings of  history.      4. WRITING AND THE ALPHABET    PICTURE WRITING    Though history is always based on written records, the first steps toward  writing are prehistoric. We start with the pictures or rough drawings  which have been found among the remains of the early Stone Age. [8]  Primitive man, however, could not rest satisfied with portraying objects.    [Illustration: VARIOUS SIGNS OF SYMBOLIC PICTURE WRITING  1, \"war\" (Dakota Indian); 2, \"morning\" (Ojibwa Indian); 3, \"nothing\"  (Ojibwa Indian); 4 and 5, \"to eat\" (Indian, Mexican, Egyptian, etc.).]    He wanted to record thoughts and actions, and so his pictures tended to  become symbols of ideas. The figure of an arrow might be made to  represent, not a real object, but the idea of an \"enemy.\" A \"fight\" could  then be shown simply by drawing two arrows directed against each other.  Many uncivilized tribes still employ picture writing of this sort. The  American Indians developed it in most"]]]
