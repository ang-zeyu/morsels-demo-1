But nobody else,  mind.\"    O'Hara promised that Moriarty should receive the news exclusively.    \"But why did the League go for ye?\"    \"They happen to be down on me. It doesn't matter why. They are.\"    \"I see,\" said O'Hara. \"Oh,\" he added, \"about that bat. The search is  being 'vigorously prosecuted'--that's a newspaper quotation--\"    \"Times?\" inquired Clowes.    \"_Wrykyn Patriot_,\" said O'Hara, pulling out a bundle of letters.  He inspected each envelope in turn, and from the fifth extracted a  newspaper cutting.    \"Read that,\" he said.    It was from the local paper, and ran as follows:--    \"_Hooligan Outrage_--A painful sensation has been caused in the  town by a deplorable ebullition of local Hooliganism, which has  resulted in the wanton disfigurement of the splendid statue of Sir  Eustace Briggs which stands in the New Recreation Grounds. Our readers  will recollect that the statue was erected to commemorate the return of  Sir Eustace as member for the borough of Wrykyn, by an overwhelming  majority, at the last election. Last Tuesday some youths of the town,  passing through the Recreation Grounds early in the morning, noticed  that the face and body of the statue were completely covered with  leaves and some black substance, which on examination proved to be tar.  They speedily lodged information at the police station. Everything  seems to point to party spite as the motive for the outrage. In view of  the forth-coming election, such an act is highly significant, and will  serve sufficiently to indicate the tactics employed by our opponents.  The search for the perpetrator (or perpetrators) of the dastardly act  is being vigorously prosecuted, and we learn with satisfaction that the  police have already several clues.\"    \"Clues!\" said Clowes, handing back the paper, \"that means _the  bat_. That gas about 'our opponents' is all a blind to put you off  your guard. You wait. There'll be more painful sensations before you've  finished with this business.\"    \"They can't have found the bat, or why did they not say so?\" observed  O'Hara.    \"Guile,\" said Clowes, \"pure guile. If I were you, I should escape while  I could. Try Callao. There's no extradition there.        'On no petition       Is extradition       Allowed in Callao.'    Either of you chaps coming over to school?\"          VIII    O'HARA ON THE TRACK      Tuesday mornings at Wrykyn were devoted--up to the quarter to eleven  interval--to the study of mathematics. That is to say, instead of going  to their form-rooms, the various forms visited the out-of-the-way nooks  and dens at the top of the buildings where the mathematical masters  were wont to lurk, and spent a pleasant two hours there playing round  games or reading fiction under the desk. Mathematics being one of the  few branches of school learning which are of any use in after life,  nobody ever dreamed of doing any work in that direction, least of all  O'Hara. It was a theory of O'Hara's that he came to school to enjoy  himself. To have done any work during a mathematics lesson would have  struck him as a positive waste of time, especially as he was in Mr  Banks' class. Mr Banks was a master who simply cried out to be ragged.  Everything he did and said seemed to invite the members of his class to  amuse themselves, and they amused themselves accordingly. One of the  advantages of being under him was that it was possible to predict to a  nicety the moment when one would be sent out of the room. This was  found very convenient.    O'Hara's ally, Moriarty, was accustomed to take his mathematics with Mr  Morgan, whose room was directly opposite Mr Banks'. With Mr Morgan it  was not quite so easy to date one's expulsion from the room under  ordinary circumstances, and in the normal wear and tear of the  morning's work, but there was one particular action which could always  be relied upon to produce the desired result.    In one corner of the room stood a gigantic globe. The problem--how did  it get into the room?--was one that had exercised the minds of many  generations of Wrykinians. It was much too big to have come through the  door. Some thought that the block had been built round it, others that  it had been placed in the room in infancy, and had since grown. To  refer the question to Mr Morgan would, in six cases out of ten, mean  instant departure from the room. But to make the event certain, it was  necessary to grasp the globe firmly and spin it round on its axis. That  always proved successful. Mr Morgan would dash down from his dais,  address the offender in spirited terms, and give him his marching  orders at once and without further trouble.    Moriarty had arranged with O'Hara to set the globe rolling at ten sharp  on this particular morning. O'Hara would then so arrange matters with  Mr Banks that they could meet in the passage at that hour, when O'Hara  wished to impart to his friend his information concerning the League.    O'Hara promised to be at the trysting-place at the hour mentioned.    He did not think there would be any difficulty about it. The news that  the League had been revived meant that there would be trouble in the  very near future, and the prospect of trouble was meat and drink to the  Irishman in O'Hara. Consequently he felt in particularly good form for  mathematics (as he interpreted the word). He thought that he would have  no difficulty whatever in keeping Mr Banks bright and amused. The first  step had to be to arouse in him an interest in life, to bring him into  a frame of mind which would induce him to look severely rather than  leniently on the next offender. This was effected as follows:--    It was Mr Banks' practice to set his class sums to work out, and, after  some three-quarters of an hour had elapsed, to pass round the form what  he called \"solutions\". These were large sheets of paper, on which he  had worked out each sum in his neat handwriting to a happy ending. When  the head of the form, to whom they were passed first, had finished with  them, he would make a slight tear in one corner, and, having done so,  hand them on to his neighbour. The neighbour, before giving them to  _his_ neighbour, would also tear them slightly. In time they would  return to their patentee and proprietor, and it was then that things  became exciting.    \"Who tore these solutions like this?\" asked Mr Banks, in the repressed  voice of one who is determined that he _will_ be calm.    No answer. The tattered solutions waved in the air.    He turned to Harringay, the head of the form.    \"Harringay, did you tear these solutions like this?\"    Indignant negative from Harringay. What he had done had been to make  the small tear in the top left-hand corner. If Mr Banks had asked, \"Did  you make this small tear in the top left-hand corner of these  solutions?\" Harringay would have scorned to deny the impeachment. But  to claim the credit for the whole work would, he felt, be an act of  flat dishonesty, and an injustice to his gifted _collaborateurs._    \"No, sir,\" said Harringay.    \"Browne!\"    \"Yes, sir?\"    \"Did you tear these solutions in this manner?\"    \"No, sir.\"    And so on through the form.    Then Harringay rose after the manner of the debater who is conscious  that he is going to say the popular thing.    \"Sir--\" he began.    \"Sit down, Harringay.\"    Harringay gracefully waved aside the absurd command.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"I think I am expressing the general consensus of  opinion among my--ahem--fellow-students, when I say that this class  sincerely regrets the unfortunate state the solutions have managed to  get themselves into.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" from a back bench.    \"It is with--\"    \"Sit _down_, Harringay.\"    \"It is with heartfelt--\"    \"Harringay, if you do not sit down--\"    \"As your ludship pleases.\" This _sotto voce_.    And Harringay resumed his seat amidst applause. O'Hara got up.    \"As me frind who has just sat down was about to observe--\"    \"Sit down, O'Hara. The whole form will remain after the class.\"    \"--the unfortunate state the solutions have managed to get thimsilves  into is sincerely regretted by this class. Sir, I think I am ixprissing  the general consensus of opinion among my fellow-students whin I say  that it is with heart-felt sorrow--\"    \"O'Hara!\"    \"Yes, sir?\"    \"Leave the room instantly.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    From the tower across the gravel came the melodious sound of chimes.  The college clock was beginning to strike ten. He had scarcely got into  the passage, and closed the door after him, when a roar as of a  bereaved spirit rang through the room opposite, followed by a string of  words, the only intelligible one being the noun-substantive \"globe\",  and the next moment the door opened and Moriarty came out. The last  stroke of ten was just booming from the clock.    There was a large cupboard in the passage, the top of which made a very  comfortable seat. They climbed on to this, and began to talk business.    \"An' what was it ye wanted to tell me?\" inquired Moriarty.    O'Hara related what he had learned from Trevor that morning.    \"An' do ye know,\" said Moriarty, when he had finished, \"I half  suspected, when I heard that Mill's study had been ragged, that it  might be the League that had done it. If ye remember, it was what they  enjoyed doing, breaking up a man's happy home. They did it frequently.\"    \"But I can't understand them doing it to Trevor at all.\"    \"They'll do it to anybody they choose till they're caught at it.\"    \"If they are caught, there'll be a row.\"    \"We must catch 'em,\" said Moriarty. Like O'Hara, he revelled in the  prospect of a disturbance. O'Hara and he were going up to Aldershot at  the end of the term, to try and bring back the light and middle-weight  medals respectively. Moriarty had won the light-weight in the previous  year, but, by reason of putting on a stone since "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#8)"],[1,"houses, of coralline  rubble and mud, in places dilapidated. There are five gates. The Bab el  Sahil and the Bab el Jadd (a new postern) open upon the sea from the  northern wall. At the Ashurbara, in the southern part of the enceinte, the  Bedouins encamp, and above it the governor holds his Durbar. The Bab Abd  el Kadir derives its name from a saint buried outside and eastward of the  city, and the Bab el Saghir is pierced in the western wall.    The public edifices are six mosques, including the Jami, or cathedral, for  Friday prayer: these buildings have queer little crenelles on whitewashed  walls, and a kind of elevated summer-house to represent the minaret. Near  one of them are remains of a circular Turkish Munar, manifestly of modern  construction. There is no Mahkamah or Kazi's court; that dignitary  transacts business at his own house, and the Festival prayers are recited  near the Saint's Tomb outside the eastern gate. The northeast angle of the  town is occupied by a large graveyard with the usual deleterious  consequences.    The climate of Zayla is cooler than that of Aden, and, the site being open  all around, it is not so unhealthy. Much spare room is enclosed by the  town walls: evaporation and Nature's scavengers act succedanea for  sewerage.    Zayla commands the adjacent harbour of Tajurrah, and is by position the  northern port of Aussa (the ancient capital of Adel), of Harar, and of  southern Abyssinia: the feuds of the rulers have, however, transferred the  main trade to Berberah. It sends caravans northwards to the Dankali, and  south-westwards, through the Eesa and Gudabirsi tribes as far as Efat and  Gurague. It is visited by Cafilas from Abyssinia, and the different races  of Bedouins, extending from the hills to the seaboard. The exports are  valuable--slaves, ivory, hides, honey, antelope horns, clarified butter,  and gums: the coast abounds in sponge, coral, and small pearls, which Arab  divers collect in the fair season. In the harbour I found about twenty  native craft, large and small: of these, ten belonged to the governor.  They trade with Berberah, Arabia, and Western India, and are navigated by  \"Rajput\" or Hindu pilots.    Provisions at Zayla are cheap; a family of six persons live well for about  30_l._ per annum. The general food is mutton: a large sheep costs one  dollar, a small one half the price; camels' meat, beef, and in winter kid,  abound. Fish is rare, and fowls are not commonly eaten. Holcus, when dear,  sells at forty pounds per dollar, at seventy pounds when cheap. It is  usually levigated with slab and roller, and made into sour cakes. Some,  however, prefer the Arab form \"balilah,\" boiled and mixed with ghee. Wheat  and rice are imported: the price varies from forty to sixty pounds the  Riyal or dollar. Of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called  Sabaya, resembling the Fatirah of Egypt: a favourite dish also is  \"harisah\"--flesh, rice flour, and boiled wheat, all finely pounded and  mixed together. Milk is not procurable during the hot weather; after rain  every house is full of it; the Bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for  a nominal sum.    Besides a large floating population, Zayla contains about 1500 souls. They  are comparatively a fine race of people, and suffer from little but fever  and an occasional ophthalmia. Their greatest hardship is the want of the  pure element: the Hissi or well, is about four miles distant from the  town, and all the pits within the walls supply brackish or bitter water,  fit only for external use. This is probably the reason why vegetables are  unknown, and why a horse, a mule, or even a dog, is not to be found in the  place.    [30] \"Fid-mer,\" or the evening flyer, is the Somali name for a bat. These  little animals are not disturbed in houses, because they keep off flies  and mosquitoes, the plagues of the Somali country. Flies abound in the  very jungles wherever cows have been, and settle in swarms upon the  traveller. Before the monsoon their bite is painful, especially that of  the small green species; and there is a red variety called \"Diksi as,\"  whose venom, according to the people, causes them to vomit. The latter  abounds in Gulays and the hill ranges of the Berberah country: it is  innocuous during the cold season. The mosquito bites bring on, according  to the same authority, deadly fevers: the superstition probably arises  from the fact that mosquitoes and fevers become formidable about the same  time.    [31] Such a building at Zayla would cost at most 500 dollars. At Aden,  2000 rupees, or nearly double the sum, would be paid for a matted shed,  which excludes neither sun, nor wind, nor rain.          CHAP. II.    LIFE IN ZAYLA.      I will not weary you, dear L., with descriptions of twenty-six quiet,  similar, uninteresting days,--days of sleep, and pipes, and coffee,--spent  at Zayla, whilst a route was traced out, guides were propitiated, camels  were bought, mules sent for, and all the wearisome preliminaries of  African travel were gone through. But a _journee_ in the Somali country  may be a novelty to you: its events shall be succinctly depicted.    With earliest dawn we arise, thankful to escape from mosquitoes and close  air. We repair to the terrace where devotions are supposed to be  performed, and busy ourselves in watching our neighbours. Two in  particular engage my attention: sisters by different mothers. The daughter  of an Indian woman is a young person of fast propensities,--her chocolate-  coloured skin, long hair, and parrot-like profile [1] are much admired by  the _elegants_ of Zayla; and she coquettes by combing, dancing, singing,  and slapping the slave-girls, whenever an adorer may be looking. We sober-  minded men, seeing her, quote the well-known lines--      \"Without justice a king is a cloud without rain;    Without goodness a sage is a field without fruit;    Without manners a youth is a bridleless horse;    Without lore an old man is a waterless wady;    Without modesty woman is bread without salt.\"    The other is a matron of Abyssinian descent, as her skin, scarcely darker  than a gipsy's, her long and bright blue fillet, and her gaudily fringed  dress, denote. She tattoos her face [2]: a livid line extends from her  front hair to the tip of her nose; between her eyebrows is an ornament  resembling a _fleur-de-lis_, and various beauty-spots adorn the corners of  her mouth and the flats of her countenance. She passes her day  superintending the slave-girls, and weaving mats [3], the worsted work of  this part of the world. We soon made acquaintance, as far as an exchange  of salams. I regret, however, to say that there was some scandal about my  charming neighbour; and that more than once she was detected making  signals to distant persons with her hands. [4]    At 6 A.M. we descend to breakfast, which usually consists of sour grain  cakes and roast mutton--at this hour a fine trial of health and cleanly  living. A napkin is passed under my chin, as if I were a small child, and  a sound scolding is administered when appetite appears deficient. Visitors  are always asked to join us: we squat on the uncarpeted floor, round a  circular stool, eat hard, and never stop to drink. The appetite of Africa  astonishes us; we dispose of six ounces here for every one in Arabia,--  probably the effect of sweet water, after the briny produce of the \"Eye of  Yemen.\" We conclude this early breakfast with coffee and pipes, and  generally return, after it, to the work of sleep.    Then, provided with some sanctified Arabic book, I prepare for the  reception of visitors. They come in by dozens,--no man having apparently  any business to occupy him,--doff their slippers at the door, enter  wrapped up in their Tobes or togas [5], and deposit their spears, point-  upwards, in the corner; those who have swords--the mark of respectability  in Eastern Africa--place them at their feet. They shake the full hand (I  was reproved for offering the fingers only); and when politely disposed,  the inferior wraps his fist in the hem of his garment. They have nothing  corresponding with the European idea of manners: they degrade all ceremony  by the epithet Shughl el banat, or \"girls' work,\" and pique themselves  upon downrightness of manner,--a favourite mask, by the by, for savage  cunning to assume. But they are equally free from affectation, shyness,  and vulgarity; and, after all, no manners are preferable to bad manners.    Sometimes we are visited at this hour by Mohammed Sharmarkay, eldest son  of the old governor. He is in age about thirty, a fine tall figure,  slender but well knit, beardless and of light complexion, with large eyes,  and a length of neck which a lady might covet. His only detracting feature  is a slight projection of the oral region, that unmistakable proof of  African blood. His movements have the grace of strength and suppleness: he  is a good jumper, runs well, throws the spear admirably, and is a  tolerable shot. Having received a liberal education at Mocha, he is held a  learned man by his fellow-countrymen. Like his father he despises  presents, looking higher; with some trouble I persuaded him to accept a  common map of Asia, and a revolver. His chief interest was concentrated in  books: he borrowed my Abu Kasim to copy [6], and was never tired of  talking about the religious sciences: he had weakened his eyes by hard  reading, and a couple of blisters were sufficient to win his gratitude.  Mohammed is now the eldest son [7]; he appears determined to keep up the  family name, having already married ten wives: the issue, however, two  infant sons, were murdered by the Eesa Bedouins. Whenever he meets his  father in the morning, he kisses his hand, and receives a salute upon the  forehead. He aspires to the government of Zayla, and looks forward more  reasonably than the Hajj to the day when the possession of Berberah will  pour gold into his coffers. He "]]]
