(_He rang, and summoned Fatout,  who made his appearance half-seas-over_.) Fatout! did I ever see a  mermaid?      FATOUT    Mermaid! mer-r-m-m-aid! Ah! merry maid! Oui, monsieur! Yes, sir, very  many. I vish dere vas von or two here in de kitchen--ma foi! Dey be  all as melancholic as so many tombstone.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    I mean, Fatout, an odd kind of human fish.      FATOUT    De odd fish! Ah, oui! I understand de phrase: ve have seen nothing  else since ve left town--ma foi!      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    You seem to have a cup too much, sir.      FATOUT    Non, monsieur: de cup too little. De fen be very unwholesome, and I  drink-a-de ponch vid Raven de butler, to keep out de bad air.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Fatout! I insist on your being sober.      FATOUT    Oui, monsieur; I vil be as sober as de reverendissime pere Jean. I  should be ver glad of de merry maid; but de butler be de odd fish,  and he swim in de bowl de ponch. Ah! ah! I do recollect de leetle-a  song:--'About fair maids, and about fair maids, and about my merry  maids all.' (_Fatout reeled out, singing_.)      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    I am overwhelmed: I never saw the rascal in such a condition before.  But will you allow me, Mr Asterias, to inquire into the _cui bono_ of  all the pains and expense you have incurred to discover a mermaid? The  _cui bono_, sir, is the question I always take the liberty to ask when  I see any one taking much trouble for any object. I am myself a sort  of Signor Pococurante, and should like to know if there be any thing  better or pleasanter, than the state of existing and doing nothing?      MR ASTERIAS    I have made many voyages, Mr Listless, to remote and barren shores:  I have travelled over desert and inhospitable lands: I have defied  danger--I have endured fatigue--I have submitted to privation. In the  midst of these I have experienced pleasures which I would not at any  time have exchanged for that of existing and doing nothing. I have  known many evils, but I have never known the worst of all, which, as  it seems to me, are those which are comprehended in the inexhaustible  varieties of _ennui_: spleen, chagrin, vapours, blue devils,  time-killing, discontent, misanthropy, and all their interminable  train of fretfulness, querulousness, suspicions, jealousies, and  fears, which have alike infected society, and the literature of  society; and which would make an arctic ocean of the human mind, if  the more humane pursuits of philosophy and science did not keep alive  the better feelings and more valuable energies of our nature.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    You are pleased to be severe upon our fashionable belles lettres.      MR ASTERIAS    Surely not without reason, when pirates, highwaymen, and other  varieties of the extensive genus Marauder, are the only _beau ideal_  of the active, as splenetic and railing misanthropy is of the  speculative energy. A gloomy brow and a tragical voice seem to have  been of late the characteristics of fashionable manners: and a morbid,  withering, deadly, antisocial sirocco, loaded with moral and political  despair, breathes through all the groves and valleys of the modern  Parnassus; while science moves on in the calm dignity of its course,  affording to youth delights equally pure and vivid--to maturity, calm  and grateful occupation--to old age, the most pleasing recollections  and inexhaustible materials of agreeable and salutary reflection; and,  while its votary enjoys the disinterested pleasure of enlarging the  intellect and increasing the comforts of society, he is himself  independent of the caprices of human intercourse and the accidents of  human fortune. Nature is his great and inexhaustible treasure. His  days are always too short for his enjoyment: _ennui_ is a stranger to  his door. At peace with the world and with his own mind, he suffices  to himself, makes all around him happy, and the close of his pleasing  and beneficial existence is the evening of a beautiful day.[6]      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Really I should like very well to lead such a life myself, but the  exertion would be too much for me. Besides, I have been at college.  I contrive to get through my day by sinking the morning in bed,  and killing the evening in company; dressing and dining in the  intermediate space, and stopping the chinks and crevices of the few  vacant moments that remain with a little easy reading. And that  amiable discontent and antisociality which you reprobate in our  present drawing-room-table literature, I find, I do assure you, a very  fine mental tonic, which reconciles me to my favourite pursuit of  doing nothing, by showing me that nobody is worth doing any thing for.      MARIONETTA    But is there not in such compositions a kind of unconscious  self-detection, which seems to carry their own antidote with them? For  surely no one who cordially and truly either hates or despises the  world will publish a volume every three months to say so.      MR FLOSKY    There is a secret in all this, which I will elucidate with a dusky  remark. According to Berkeley, the _esse_ of things is _percipi_. They  exist as they are perceived. But, leaving for the present, as far  as relates to the material world, the materialists, hyloists, and  antihyloists, to settle this point among them, which is indeed      A subtle question, raised among    Those out o' their wits, and those i' the wrong:    for only we transcendentalists are in the right: we may very safely  assert that the _esse_ of happiness is _percipi_. It exists as it is  perceived. 'It is the mind that maketh well or ill.' The elements of  pleasure and pain are every where. The degree of happiness that any  circumstances or objects can confer on us depends on the mental  disposition with which we approach them. If you consider what is meant  by the common phrases, a happy disposition and a discontented temper,  you will perceive that the truth for which I am contending is  universally admitted.      _(Mr Flosky suddenly stopped: he found himself unintentionally  trespassing within the limits of common sense.)_      MR HILARY    It is very true; a happy disposition finds materials of enjoyment  every where. In the city, or the country--in society, or in  solitude--in the theatre, or the forest--in the hum of the multitude,  or in the silence of the mountains, are alike materials of reflection  and elements of pleasure. It is one mode of pleasure to listen to  the music of 'Don Giovanni,' in a theatre glittering with light, and  crowded with elegance and beauty: it is another to glide at sunset  over the bosom of a lonely lake, where no sound disturbs the silence  but the motion of the boat through the waters. A happy disposition  derives pleasure from both, a discontented temper from neither, but  is always busy in detecting deficiencies, and feeding dissatisfaction  with comparisons. The one gathers all the flowers, the other all the  nettles, in its path. The one has the faculty of enjoying every thing,  the other of enjoying nothing. The one realises all the pleasure of  the present good; the other converts it into pain, by pining after  something better, which is only better because it is not present, and  which, if it were present, would not be enjoyed. These morbid spirits  are in life what professed critics are in literature; they see nothing  but faults, because they are predetermined to shut their eyes to  beauties. The critic does his utmost to blight genius in its infancy;  that which rises in spite of him he will not see; and then he  complains of the decline of literature. In like manner, these cankers  of society complain of human nature and society, when they have  wilfully debarred themselves from all the good they contain, and done  their utmost to blight their own happiness and that of all around  them. Misanthropy is sometimes the product of disappointed  benevolence; but it is more frequently the offspring of overweening  and mortified vanity, quarrelling with the world for not being better  treated than it deserves.      SCYTHROP (_to Marionetta_)    These remarks are rather uncharitable. There is great good in human  nature, but it is at present ill-conditioned. Ardent spirits cannot  but be dissatisfied with things as they are; and, according to their  views of the probabilities of amelioration, they will rush into the  extremes of either hope or despair--of which the first is enthusiasm,  and the second misanthropy; but their sources in this case are the  same, as the Severn and the Wye run in different directions, and both  rise in Plinlimmon.      MARIONETTA    'And there is salmon in both;' for the resemblance is about as close  as that between Macedon and Monmouth.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VIII      Marionetta observed the next day a remarkable perturbation in  Scythrop, for which she could not imagine any probable cause. She was  willing to believe at first that it had some transient and trifling  source, and would pass off in a day or two; but, contrary to this  expectation, it daily increased. She was well aware that Scythrop had  a strong tendency to the love of mystery, for its own sake; that is  to say, he would employ mystery to serve a purpose, but would first  choose his purpose by its capability of mystery. He seemed now to have  more mystery on his hands than the laws of the system allowed, and to  wear his coat of darkness with an air of great discomfort. All her  little playful arts lost by degrees much of their power either to  irritate or to soothe; and the first perception of her diminished  influence produced in her an immediate depression of spirits, and a  consequent sadness of demeanour, that rendered her very interesting to  Mr Glowry; who, duly considering the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9914"],[0,"The Babylonian Legends of the Creation (#8)"],[1,"Scorpion-man,    33. \"'The Storm-wind, the Fish-man, the Horned Beast.    34. \"'They carried the Weapon which spared not, nor flinched from the  battle,    35. \"'Most mighty were Tiamat's allies, they could not be resisted.    36. \"'Thus she caused Eleven [monsters] of this kind to come into  being.    37. \"'Among the gods, her first-born son who had collected her  company,    38. \"'That is to say, Kingu, she set on high, she made him the great  one among them,    39. \"'Leader of the hosts in the battle, disposer of the troops,    40. \"'Bearer of the firmly-grasped weapon, attacker in the fight.    41. \"'He who in the battle is the master of the weapon,    42. \"'She appointed, she made him to sit down in [goodly apparel]    43. \"'[Saying]: I have recited the incantation for thee, I have  magnified thee in the assembly of the gods.    44. \"''I have filled his (i.e., thy) hand with the sovereignty  of the whole company of the gods.    45. \"''Mayest thou be magnified, thou who art my only spouse,    46. \"''May the Anunnaki make great thy renown over all of them.\"'    47. \"She gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, she fastened it on his head  [saying]:    48. \"'As for thee, thy command shall not fall empty, what goeth forth  from thy mouth shall be established.'    49. \"When Kingu was raised on high and had taken the heavens  (literally, the god Anutum),    50. \"He fixed the destinies for the gods, his sons, [saying]:    51. \"'Open your mouths, let the Fire-god be quenched.    52. \"'He who is glorious in battle and is most mighty shall do great  deeds.'    53. \"'I sent the god Anu, but he could not prevail against her.    54. \"'Nudimmud (i.e., Ea) was afraid and turned back,    55. \"'Marduk, your son, the envoy of the gods, hath set out.    56. \"'His heart is stirred up to oppose Tiamat.    57. \"'He opened his mouth, he spoke unto me [saying]:    58. \"'Should I as your avenger    59. \"'Slay Tiamat, and bestow life upon you,    60. \"'Summon a meeting, proclaim and magnify my position,    61. \"'Sit ye down together in friendly fashion in Up-shukkinaku.    62. \"'Let me issue decrees by the opening of my mouth even as ye do,    63. \"'Whatsoever I bring to pass let it remain unaltered.    64. \"'That which my mouth uttereth shall neither fail nor be brought  to nought.'    65. \"Hasten ye therefore, issue your decrees speedily    66. \"That he may go to meet your mighty enemy.\"    67.

Brother [god] kissed brother [god] in the [divine] assembly,    133. They held a meeting, they sat down to a feast,    134. They ate bread, they heated the [sesame wine],    135. The taste of the sweet drink confused their ...    136. They drank themselves drunk, their bodies were filled to  overflowing,    137. They were overcome by heaviness [of drink], their livers  (i.e., spirits) were exalted,    138. They issued the decree for Marduk as their avenger.        FOURTH TABLET.    1. They founded for him a majestic canopy,    2. He (i.e., Marduk) seated himself in the seat of kingship in  the presence of his fathers [who said unto him]:    3. \"Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.    4. \"Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum  (i.e., as fixed as the sky).    5. \"Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.    6. \"Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum  (i.e., as fixed as the sky).    7. \"From this day onward thy command shall not be abrogated.    8. \"The power to exalt to heaven and to cast down to the earth both  shall be in thy hand,    9. \"That which goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established,  against thy utterance shall be no appeal.    10. \"No one among the gods shall overstep thy boundary,    11. \"Worship, which is the object of the sanctuary of the gods,    12. \"Whensoever they lack [it] shall be forthcoming in thy sanctuary,    13. \"O god Marduk, thou art our avenger.    14. \"We have given unto thee sovereignty over the whole creation,    15. \"Thou shalt sit down, in the council thy word shall be exalted,    16. \"Thy weapon shall never fall [from thy hands], it shall break the  head of thy foe.    17. \"Lord, whosoever putteth his trust in thee, spare thou his life,    18. \"And the god who deviseth evil, pour thou out his soul.\"    19. Then a cloak (literally, one cloak) was set in their midst,    20. They addressed the god Marduk their first-born [saying]:    21. \"Thou, Lord, shalt hold the foremost position among the gods.    22. \"Decree thou the throwing down[1] and the building up,[2] and it  shall come to pass.

Marduk spoke the word, the cloak disappeared,    26. He spoke a second time, the cloak reappeared.    27. When the gods his fathers saw the issue of the utterance of his  mouth    28. They rejoiced and adored [him, saying], \"Marduk is King.\"    29. They conferred upon him the sceptre, the throne, and the symbol of  royalty (?)[1]    [Footnote 1: The meaning of _pal-a_ is unknown.]    30. They gave him the unrivalled weapon, the destroyer of the enemy  [saying]:    31. \"Go, cut off the life of Tiamat.    32. \"Let the wind carry her blood into the depth [under the earth].\"    33. The gods, his fathers, issued the decree for the god Bel.    34. They set him on the road which leadeth to peace and adoration.    35. He strung [his] bow, he set ready his weapon [in the stand],    36. He slung"]]]
