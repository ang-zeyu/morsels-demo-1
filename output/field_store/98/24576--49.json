Differentiating points are to be found mainly in the colors and patterns  of the flowers. The veins, which radiate from the centre of the corolla  are branched in some and undivided in others; in one elementary species  they are wholly lacking. The purple color may be absent, leaving the  flowers of a pale or a deep yellow. Or the purple may be reddish or  bluish. Of the petals all five may have the purple hue on their tips, or  this attribute may be limited to the two upper ones. Contrasting with  this wide variability is the stability of the yellow spot in the centre,  which is always present and becomes inconspicuous only, when the whole  petals are of the same hue. It is a general conception that colors and  color-markings are liable to great variability and do not constitute  reliable standards. But the cultures of Wittrock have proved the  contrary, at least in the case of the violets. No pattern, however  quaint, appears changeable, if one elementary species only is  considered. Hundreds of plants from seeds [44] from one locality may be  grown, and all will exhibit exactly the same markings. Most of these  forms are of very local occurrence. The most beautiful of all, the  _ornatissima_, is found only in Jemtland, the _aurobadia_ only in  Sodermanland, the anopetala_ in other localities in the same country,  the _roseola_ near Stockholm, and the yellow _lutescens_ in Finmarken.    The researches of Wittrock included only a small number of elementary  species, but every one who has observed the violets in the central parts  of Europe must be convinced that many dozens of constant forms of the  typical _Viola tricolor_ might easily be found and isolated.    We now come to the field pansy, the _Viola arvensis_, a very common weed  in the grain-fields of central Europe. I have already mentioned its  small corolla, surpassed by the lobes of the calyx and its capacity of  self-fertilization. It has still other curious differentiating  characters; the pollen grains, which are square in _V. tricolor_, are  five-sided in _V. arvensis_. Some transgressive fluctuating variability  may occur in both cases through the admixture of pollen-grains. Even  three-angled pollen grains are seen sometimes. Other marks are observed  in the form of the anthers and the spur.    There seem to be very many local subspecies [45] of the field-pansy.  Jordan has described some from the vicinity of Lyons, and Wittrock  others from the northern parts of Europe. They diverge from their common  prototype in nearly all attributes, the flowers not showing the  essential differentiating characters as in the _V. tricolor_. Some have  their flower-stalks erect, and in others the flowers are held nearly at  right angles to the stem. _V. pallescens_ is a small, almost unbranched  species with small pale flowers. _V. segetalis_ is a stouter species  with two dark blue spots on the tips of the upper petals. _V. agrestis_  is a tall and branched, hairy form. _V. nemausensis_ attains a height of  only 10 cm., has rounded leaves and long flower-stalks. Even the seeds  afford characters which may be made use of in isolating the various  species.    The above-mentioned elementary forms belong to the flora of southern  France, and Wittrock has isolated and cultivated a number of others from  the fields of Sweden. A species from Stockholm is called _Viola patens_;  _V. arvensis curtisepala_ occurs in Gotland, and _V. arvensis striolata_  is a distinct form, which has appeared in his cultures without its true  origin being ascertained.    The alpine violets comprise a more widespread type with some local  elementary species [46] derived exactly in the same way as the  tricolored field pansies.    Summarizing the general result of this description we see that the  original species _Viola tricolor_ may be split up into larger and lesser  groups of separate forms. These last prove to be constant in  pedigree-cultures, and therefore are to be considered as really existent  units. They are very numerous, comprising many dozens in each of the two  larger subdivisions.    All systematic grouping of these forms, and their combination into  subspecies and species rests on the comparative study of their  characters. The result of such studies must necessarily depend on  principles which underlie them. According to the choice of these  principles, the construction of the groups will be found to be  different. Wittrock trusts in the first place to morphologic characters,  and considers the development as passing from the more simple to the  more complex types. On the other hand the geographic distribution may be  considered as an indication of the direction of evolution, the  wide-spread forms being regarded as the common parents of the minor  local species.    However, such considerations are only of secondary importance. It must  be borne in mind that an ordinary systematic species may include [47]  many dozens of elementary forms, each of which remains constant and  unchanged in successive generations, even if cultivated in the same  garden and under similar external conditions.    Leaving the violets, we may take the vernal whitlow-grass or _Draba  verna_ for a second illustration. This little annual cruciferous plant  is common in the fields of many parts of the United States, though  originally introduced from Europe. It has small basal rosettes which  develop during summer and winter, and produce numerous leafless  flowering stems early in the spring. It is a native of central Europe  and western Asia, and may be considered as one of the most common  plants, occurring anywhere in immense numbers on sandy soils. Jordan was  the first to point out that it is not the same throughout its entire  range. Although a hasty survey does not reveal differences, they show  themselves on closer inspection. De Bary, Thuret, Rosen and many others  confirmed this result, and repeated the pedigree-cultures of Jordan.  Every type is constant and remains unchanged in successive generations.  The anthers open in the flower-buds and pollinate the stigmas before the  expansion of the flowers, thus assuring self-fertilization. Moreover,  these inconspicuous little flowers are only sparingly visited by  insects. Dozens of subspecies [48] may be cultivated in the same garden  without any real danger of their intercrossing. They remain as pure as  under perfect isolation.    It is very interesting to observe the aspect of such types, when growing  near each other. Hundreds of rosettes exhibit one type, and are  undoubtedly similar. The alternative group is distinguishable at first  sight, though the differentiating marks are often so slight as to be  traceable with difficulty. Two elementary species occur in Holland, one  with narrow leaves in the western provinces and one with broader foliage  in the northern parts. I have cultivated them side by side, and was as  much struck with the uniformity within each group, as with the contrast  between the two sets.    Nearly all organs show differences. The most marked are those of the  leaves, which may be small or large, linear or elliptic or oblong and  even rhomboidal in shape, more or less hairy with simple or with  stellate branched hairs, and finally of a pure green or of a glaucous  color. The petals are as a rule obcordate, but this type may be combined  with others having more or less broad emarginations at the summit, and  with differences in breadth which vary from almost linear types to  others which touch along their margins. The pods are short and broad, or  long and narrow, or varying in sundry other [49] ways. All in all there  are constant differences which are so great that it has been possible to  distinguish and to describe large numbers of types.    Many of them have been tested as to their constancy from seed. Jordan  made numerous cultures, some of which lasted ten or twelve years; Thuret  has verified the assertion concerning their constancy by cultures  extending over seven years in some instances; Villars and de Bary made  numerous trials of shorter duration. All agree as to the main points.  The local races are uniform and come true from seed; the variability of  the species is not of a fluctuating, but of a polymorphous nature. A  given elementary species keeps within its limits and cannot vary beyond  them, but the whole group gives the impression of variability by its  wide range of distinct, but nearly allied forms.    The geographic distribution of these elementary species of the  whitlow-grass is quite distinct from that of the violets. Here  predominant species are limited to restricted localities. Most of them  occupy one or more departments of France, and in Holland two of them are  spread over several provinces. An important number are native in the  centre of Europe, and from the vicinity of Lyons, Jordan succeeded in  establishing about fifty elementary [50] species in his garden. In this  region they are crowded together and not rarely two or even more quite  distinct forms are observed to grow side by side on the same spot.  Farther away from this center they are more widely dispersed, each  holding its own in its habitat. In all, Jordan has distinguished about  two hundred species of _Draba verna_ from Europe and western Asia.  Subsequent authors have added new types to the already existing number  from time to time.    The constancy of these elementary species is directly proven by the  experiments quoted above, and moreover it may be deduced from the  uniformity of each type within its own domain. These are so large that  most of the localities are practically isolated from one another, and  must have been so for centuries. If the types were slowly changing such  localities would often, though of course not always, exhibit slighter  differences, and on the geographic limits of neighboring species"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#8)"],[1," in retail as well as in wholesale  business, and, second, that it must be compensated for the good-will  of its business, which it had built up through a number of years  by the expenditure of very large sums of money. Of course where  a company has been in operation for years and is continually  advertising its business, its good-will often is its greatest  asset and has often been built up by the greatest expenditure  of money. For instance, in buying a successful newspaper, the  value does not lie in the real-estate, presses, etc., but in  the good-will of the newspaper, the result of years of work and  expensive advertising.    I made no objection that the German government did not have a  perfect right to create this monopoly and to put the American  controlled company entirely out of the field, but insisted upon  a fair compensation for all their property and good-will. Even a  fair compensation for the property and good-will would have started  the government monopoly company with a large debt upon which it  would have been required to pay interest, and this interest, of  course, would have been added to the cost of oil to the German  consumers. In my final conversation on the subject with von  Bethmann-Hollweg, he said, \"You don't mean to say that President  Wilson and Secretary Bryan will do anything for the Standard  Oil Company?\" I answered that everyone in America knew that  the Standard Oil Company had neither influence with nor control  over President Wilson and Secretary Bryan, but that they both  could and would give the Standard Oil Company the same measure  of protection which any American citizen doing business abroad  had a right to expect from his government. I also said that I  thought they had done enough for the Germans interested in the  Galician and Roumanian oil fields when they had used the Prussian  state railways to give these oil producers an unfair advantage  over those importing American oil.    Shortly after this the question of the creation of this oil monopoly  was dropped and naturally has not been revived during the war,  and I very much doubt whether, after the war, the people of  liberalised Germany will consent to pay more for inferior oil in  order to make good the investments of certain German banks and  financiers in Galicia and Roumania. I doubt whether a more liberal  Germany will wish to put the control of a great business in the  hands of the government, thereby greatly increasing the number  of government officials and the weight of government influence  in the country. Heaven knows there are officials enough to-day  in Germany, without turning over a great department of private  industry to the government for the sole purpose of making good  bad investments of certain financiers and adding to the political  influence of the central government.    In May, 1914, Colonel House and his beautiful wife arrived to pay  us a visit in Berlin. He was, of course, anxious to have a talk  with the Emperor, and this was arranged by the Emperor inviting  the Colonel and me to what is called the _Schrippenfest_,  at the new palace at Potsdam.    For many years, in fact since the days of Frederick the Great,  the learning (_Lehr_) battalion, composed of picked soldiers  from all the regiments of Prussia, has been quartered at Potsdam,  and on a certain day in April this battalion has been given a  dinner at which they eat white rolls (_Schrippen_) instead  of the usual black bread. This feast has been carried on from  these older days and has become quite a ceremony.    The Colonel and I motored to Potsdam, arrayed in dress-suits, and  waited in one of the salons of the ground floor of the new palace.  Finally the Emperor and the Empress and several of the Princes and  their wives and the usual dignitaries of the Emperor's household  arrived. The Colonel was presented to the royalties and then a  Divine Service was held in the open air at one end of the palace.  The Empress and Princesses occupied large chairs and the Emperor  stood with his sons behind him and then the various dignitaries  of the court. The Lehr Battalion was drawn up behind. There were  a large band and the choir boys from the Berlin cathedral. The  service was very impressive and not less so because of a great  Zeppelin which hovered over our heads during the whole of the  service.    After Divine Service, the Lehr Battalion marched in review and  then was given food and beer in long arbours constructed in front  of the palace. While the men were eating, the Emperor and Empress  and Princes passed among the tables, speaking to the soldiers.  We then went to the new palace where in the extraordinary hall  studded with curious specimens of minerals from all countries,  a long table forming three sides of a square was set for about  sixty people. Colonel House and I sat directly across the table  from the Emperor, with General Falkenhayn between us. The Emperor  was in a very good mood and at one time, talking across the table,  said to me that the Colonel and I, in our black dress-suits,  looked like a couple of crows, that we were like two undertakers  at a feast and spoiled the picture. After luncheon the Emperor  had a long talk with Colonel House, and then called me into the  conversation.    On May twenty-sixth, I arranged that the Colonel should meet  von Tirpitz at dinner in our house. We did not guess then what  a central figure in this war the great admiral was going to be.  At that time and until his fall, he was Minister of Marine, which  corresponds to our Secretary of the Navy Department, and what  is called in German _Reichsmarineamt_. The Colonel also  met the Chancellor, von Jagow, Zimmermann and many others.    There are two other heads of departments, connected with the  navy, of equal rank with the Secretary of the Naval Department  and not reporting to him. These are the heads of the naval staff  and the head of what is known as the Marine Cabinet. The head  of the naval staff is supposed to direct the actual operations  of warfare in the navy, and the head of the Marine Cabinet is  charged with the personnel of the navy, with determining what  officers are to be promoted and what officers are to take over  ships or commands.    While von Tirpitz was Secretary of the Navy, by the force of  his personality, he dominated the two other departments, but  since his fall the heads of these two other departments have  held positions as important, if not more important, than that  of Secretary of the Navy.    On May thirty-first, we took Colonel and Mrs. House to the aviation  field of Joachimsthal. Here the Dutch aviator Fokker was flying and  after being introduced to us he did some stunts for our benefit.  Fokker was employed by the German army and later became a naturalised  German. The machines designed by him, and named after him, for  a long time held the mastery of the air on the West front.    The advice of Colonel House, a most wise and prudent counsellor,  was at all times of the greatest value to me during my stay in  Berlin. We exchanged letters weekly, I sending him a weekly bulletin  of the situation in Berlin and much news and gossip too personal  or too indefinite to be placed in official reports.    War with Germany seemed a thing not even to be considered when  in this month of May, 1914, I called on the Foreign Office, by  direction, to thank the Imperial Government for the aid given  the Americans at Tampico by German ships of war.    Early in February, Mr. S. Bergmann, a German who had made a fortune  in America and who had returned to Germany to take up again his  German citizenship, invited me to go over the great electrical  works which he had established. Prince Henry of Prussia, the  brother of the Emperor, was the only other guest and together  we inspected the vast works, afterwards having lunch in Mr.  Bergmann's office. Prince Henry has always been interested in  America since his visit here. On that visit he spent most of  his time with German societies, etc. Of course, now we know he  came as a propagandist with the object of welding together the  Germans in America and keeping up their interest in the Fatherland.  He made a similar trip to the Argentine just before the Great  War, with a similar purpose, but I understand his excursion was  not considered a great success, from any standpoint. A man of  affable manners, no one is better qualified to go abroad as a  German propagandist than he. If all Germans had been like him  there would have been no World War in 1914.    On March eighteenth, we were invited to a fancy-dress ball at  the palace of the Crown Prince. The guests were mostly young  people and officers. The Crown Princess wore a beautiful Russian  dress with its characteristic high front piece on the head. The  Crown Prince and all the officers present were in the picturesque  uniforms of their respective regiments of a period of one hundred  years ago. Prince Oscar, the fifth son of the Kaiser, looked  particularly well.    The hours for balls in Berlin, where officers attended, were a  good example for hostesses in this country. The invitations read  for eight o'clock and that meant eight o'clock. A cold dinner  of perhaps four courses is immediately served on the arrival of  the guests, who, with the exception of a very few distinguished  ones, are not given any particular places. At a quarter to nine  the dancing begins, supper is at about eleven and the guests go  home at twelve, at an hour which enables the officers to get  to bed early. During the season there were balls at the British  and French Embassy and performances by the Russian Ballet, then  in Berlin, at the Russian Embassy.    The wonderful new Royal Library, designed by Ihne, was opened  on March twenty-second. The Emperor attended, coming in with  the beautiful Queen of Roumania walking by his side. She is an  exceedingly handsome woman, half English and half Russian. Some  days"]]]
