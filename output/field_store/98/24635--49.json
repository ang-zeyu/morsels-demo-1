Where on  earth have you been to, running away like this, without a word?\"    \"I only went----\"    \"Well, it doesn't matter where you went. The main point is, what are you  going to do about it?\"    \"We thought we'd better come along and talk it over,\" said R. P. de  Parys.    \"Talk what over?\" said Roland: \"the revue?\"    \"Oh, don't try and be funny, for goodness' sake!\" snapped Miss  Verepoint. \"It doesn't suit you. You haven't the right shape of head.  What do you suppose we want to talk over? The theater, of course.\"    \"What about the theater?\"    Miss Verepoint looked searchingly at him. \"Don't you ever read the  papers?\"    \"I haven't seen a paper since I went away.\"    \"Well, better have it quick and not waste time breaking it gently,\"  said Miss Verepoint. \"The theater's been burned down--that's what's  happened.\"    \"Burned down?\"    \"Burned down!\" repeated Roland.    \"That's what I said, didn't I? The suffragettes did it. They left copies  of 'Votes for Women' about the place. The silly asses set fire to two  other theaters as well, but they happened to be in main thoroughfares  and the fire-brigade got them under control at once. I suppose they  couldn't find the Windsor. Anyhow, it's burned to the ground and what we  want to know is what are you going to do about it?\"    Roland was much too busy blessing the good angels of Kingsway to reply  at once. R. P. de Parys, sympathetic soul, placed a wrong construction  on his silence.    \"Poor old Roly!\" he said. \"It's quite broken him up. The best thing we  can do is all to go off and talk it over at the Savoy, over a bit of  lunch.\"    \"Well,\" said Miss Verepoint, \"what are you going to do--rebuild the  Windsor or try and get another theater?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The authors were all for rebuilding the Windsor. True, it would take  time, but it would be more satisfactory in every way. Besides, at this  time of the year it would be no easy matter to secure another theater at  a moment's notice.    To R. P. de Parys and Bromham Rhodes the destruction of the Windsor  Theater had appeared less in the light of a disaster than as a direct  intervention on the part of Providence. The completion of that tiresome  second act, which had brooded over their lives like an ugly cloud, could  now be postponed indefinitely.    \"Of course,\" said R. P. de Parys, thoughtfully, \"our contract with you  makes it obligatory on you to produce our revue by a certain date--but I  dare say, Bromham, we could meet Roly there, couldn't we?\"    \"Sure!\" said Rhodes. \"Something nominal, say a further five hundred on  account of fees would satisfy us. I certainly think it would be better  to rebuild the Windsor, don't you, R. P.?\"    \"I do,\" agreed R. P. de Parys, cordially. \"You see, Roly, our revue has  been written to fit the Windsor. It would be very difficult to alter it  for production at another theater. Yes, I feel sure that rebuilding the  Windsor would be your best course.\"    There was a pause.    \"What do you think, Roly-poly?\" asked Miss Verepoint, as Roland made no  sign.    \"Nothing would delight me more than to rebuild the Windsor, or to take  another theater, or do anything else to oblige,\" he said, cheerfully.  \"Unfortunately, I have no more money to burn.\"    It was as if a bomb had suddenly exploded in the room. A dreadful  silence fell upon his hearers. For the moment no one spoke. R. P. de  Parys woke with a start out of a beautiful dream of prawn curry and  Bromham Rhodes forgot that he had not tasted food for nearly two hours.  Miss Verepoint was the first to break the silence.    \"Do you mean to say,\" she gasped, \"that you didn't insure the place?\"    Roland shook his head. The particular form in which Miss Verepoint had  put the question entitled him, he felt, to make this answer.    \"Why didn't you?\" Miss Verepoint's tone was almost menacing.    \"Because it did not appear to me to be necessary.\"    Nor was it necessary, said Roland to his conscience. Mr. Montague had  done all the insuring that was necessary--and a bit over.    Miss Verepoint fought with her growing indignation, and lost. \"What  about the salaries of the people who have been rehearsing all this  time?\" she demanded.    \"I'm sorry that they should be out of an engagement, but it is scarcely  my fault. However, I propose to give each of them a month's salary. I  can manage that, I think.\"    Miss Verepoint rose. \"And what about me? What about me, that's what I  want to know. Where do I get off? If you think I'm going to marry you  without your getting a theater and putting up this revue you're jolly  well mistaken.\"    Roland made a gesture which was intended to convey regret and  resignation. He even contrived to sigh.    \"Very well, then,\" said Miss Verepoint, rightly interpreting this  behavior as his final pronouncement on the situation. \"Then everything's  jolly well off.\"    She swept out of the room, the two authors following in her wake like  porpoises behind a liner. Roland went to his bureau, unlocked it and  took out a bundle of documents. He let his fingers stray lovingly among  the fire insurance policies which energetic Mr. Montague had been at  such pains to secure from so many companies.    \"And so,\" he said softly to himself, \"am I.\"            THE EPISODE OF THE LIVE WEEKLY    Fourth of a Series of Six Stories [First published in _Pictorial  Review_, August 1916]      It was with a start that Roland Bleke realized that the girl at the  other end of the bench was crying. For the last few minutes, as far  as his preoccupation allowed him to notice them at all, he had been  attributing the subdued sniffs to a summer cold, having just recovered  from one himself.    He was embarrassed. He blamed the fate that had led him to this  particular bench, but he wished to give himself up to quiet deliberation  on the question of what on earth he was to do with two hundred and fifty  thousand pounds, to which figure his fortune had now risen.    The sniffs continued. Roland's discomfort increased. Chivalry had always  been his weakness. In the old days, on a hundred and forty pounds  a year, he had had few opportunities of indulging himself in this  direction; but now it seemed to him sometimes that the whole world was  crying out for assistance.    Should he speak to her? He wanted to; but only a few days ago his eyes  had been caught by the placard of a weekly paper bearing the title of  'Squibs,' on which in large letters was the legend \"Men Who Speak  to Girls,\" and he had gathered that the accompanying article was a  denunciation rather than a eulogy of these individuals. On the other  hand, she was obviously in distress.    Another sniff decided him.    \"I say, you know,\" he said.    The girl looked at him. She was small, and at the present moment had  that air of the floweret surprized while shrinking, which adds a good  thirty-three per cent. to a girl's attractions. Her nose, he noted, was  delicately tip-tilted. A certain pallor added to her beauty. Roland's  heart executed the opening steps of a buck-and-wing dance.    \"Pardon me,\" he went on, \"but you appear to be in trouble. Is there  anything I can do for you?\"    She looked at him again--a keen look which seemed to get into Roland's  soul and walk about it with a searchlight. Then, as if satisfied by the  inspection, she spoke.    \"No, I don't think there is,\" she said. \"Unless you happen to be the  proprietor of a weekly paper with a Woman's Page, and need an editress  for it.\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"Well, that's all any one could do for me--give me back my work or give  me something else of the same sort.\"    \"Oh, have you lost your job?\"    \"I have. So would you mind going away, because I want to go on crying,  and I do it better alone. You won't mind my turning you out, I hope, but  I was here first, and there are heaps of other benches.\"    \"No, but wait a minute. I want to hear about this. I might be able--what  I mean is--think of something. Tell me all about it.\"    There is no doubt that the possession of two hundred and fifty thousand  pounds tones down a diffident man's diffidence. Roland began to feel  almost masterful.    \"Why should I?\"    \"Why shouldn't you?\"    \"There's something in that,\" said the girl reflectively. \"After all,  you might know somebody. Well, as you want to know, I have just been  discharged from a paper called 'Squibs.' I used to edit the Woman's  Page.\"    \"By Jove, did you write that article on 'Men Who Speak----'?\"    The hard manner in which she had wrapped herself as in a garment  vanished instantly. Her eyes softened. She even blushed. Just a becoming  pink, you know!    \"You don't mean to say you read it? I didn't think that any one ever  really read 'Squibs.'\"    \"Read it!\" cried Roland, recklessly abandoning truth. \"I should jolly  well think so. I know it by heart. Do you mean to say that, after  an article like that, they actually sacked you? Threw you out as a  failure?\"    \"Oh, they didn't send me away for incompetence. It was simply because  they couldn't afford to keep me on. Mr. Petheram was very nice about  it.\"    \"Who's Mr. Petheram?\"    \"Mr. Petheram's everything. He calls himself the editor, but he's really  everything except office-boy, and I expect he'll be that next week.  When I started with the paper, there was quite a large staff. But it got  whittled down by degrees till there was only Mr. Petheram and myself. It  was like the crew of the 'Nancy Bell.' They got eaten one by one, till  I was the only one left. And now I've gone. Mr. Petheram is doing the  whole paper now.\"    \"How is it that he can't get anything better to do?\" Roland said.    \"He has done lots of better things. He used to be at Carmelite House,  but they thought he was too old.\"    Roland felt relieved."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#8)"],[1," round sum for  it at Hamburg; and I thought so too, wherefore we stopped at home next  day, seeing that we did not want for food, and that my child, as well as  myself, both wished to refresh ourselves a little before we set out on our  journey; _item_, we likewise bethought us that old Master Rothoog, of  Loddin, who is a cabinetmaker, might knock together a little box for us to  put the amber in, wherefore I sent the maid to him in the afternoon.  Meanwhile we ourselves went up the Streckelberg, where I cut a young  fir-tree with my pocket-knife, which I had saved from the enemy, and  shaped it like a spade, so that I might be better able to dig deep  therewith. First, however, we looked about us well on the mountain, and,  seeing nobody, my daughter walked on to the place, which she straightway  found again. Great God! what a mass of amber was there! The vein was hard  upon twenty feet long, as near as I could feel, and the depth of it I  could not sound. Nevertheless, save four good-sized pieces, none, however,  so big as those of yesterday, we this day only broke out little splinters,  such as the apothecaries bruise for incense. After we had most carefully  covered and smoothed over the place, a great mishap was very near  befalling us; for we met Witthan her little girl, who was seeking  blackberries, and she asked what my daughter carried in her apron, who  straightway grew red, and stammered so that our secret would have been  betrayed if I had not presently said, \"What is that to thee? She has got  fir-apples for firing,\" which the child believed. Wherefore we resolved in  future only to go up the mountain at night by moonlight, and we went home  and got there before the maid, and hid our treasure in the bedstead, so  that she should not see it.          _The Tenth Chapter_      HOW WE JOURNEYED TO WOLGAST, AND MADE GOOD BARTER THERE    Two days after, so says my daughter, but old Ilse thinks it was three  (and I myself know not which is true), we at last went to the town,  seeing that Master Rothoog had not got the box ready before. My daughter  covered it over with a piece of my departed wife her wedding-gown, which  the Imperialists had indeed torn to pieces, but as they had left it  lying outside, the wind had blown it into the orchard, where we found  it. It was very shabby before, otherwise I doubt not they would have  carried it off with them. On account of the box, we took old Ilse with  us, who had to carry it, and, as amber is very light ware, she readily  believed that the box held nothing but eatables. At daybreak, then, we  took our staves in our hands and set out with God. Near Zitze, a hare  ran across the road before us, which they say bodes no good. Well-a-day!  When we came near Bannemin I asked a fellow if it was true that here a  mother had slaughtered her own child from hunger, as I had heard. He  said it was, and that the old woman's name was Zisse; but that God had  been wroth at such a horrid deed, and she had got no good by it, seeing  that she vomited so much upon eating it that she forthwith gave up the  ghost. On the whole, he thought things were already going rather better  with the parish, as Almighty God had richly blessed them with fish, both  out of the sea and the Achterwater. Nevertheless a great number of  people had died of hunger here also. He told us that their vicar,  his reverence Johannes Lampius, had had his house burnt down by the  Imperialists, and was lying in a hovel near the church. I sent him  my greeting, desiring that he would soon come to visit me (which the  fellow promised he would take care to deliver to him), for the reverend  Johannes is a pious and learned man, and has also composed sundry Latin  _Chronosticha_ on these wretched times, in _metrum heroicum_, which, I  must say, please me greatly. When we had crossed the ferry we went in at  Sehms his house, on the Castle Green, who keeps an ale-house; he told us  that the pestilence had not yet altogether ceased in the town; whereat I  was much afraid, more especially as he described to us so many other  horrors and miseries of these fearful times, both here and in other  places, _e.g._ of the great famine in the island of Ruegen, where a  number of people had grown as black as Moors from hunger; a wondrous  thing if it be true, and one might almost gather therefrom how the first  blackamoors came about. But be that as it may. _Summa_. When Master  Sehms had told us all the news he had heard, and we had thus learnt,  to our great comfort, that the Lord had not visited us only in these  times of heavy need, I called him aside into a chamber and asked him  whether I could not here find means to get money for a piece of amber  which my daughter had found by the sea. At first he said \"No\"; but then  recollecting, he began, \"Stay, let me see, at Nicolas Graeke's, the inn  at the castle, there are two great Dutch merchants--Dieterich von  Pehnen and Jacob Kiekebusch--who are come to buy pitch and boards,  _item_ timber for ships and beams; perchance they may like to cheapen  your amber too; but you had better go up to the castle yourself, for I  do not know for certain whether they still are there.\" This I did,  although I had not yet eaten anything in the man's house, seeing that I  wanted to know first what sort of bargain I might make, and to save the  farthings belonging to the church until then. So I went into the  castle-yard. Gracious God! what a desert had even his Princely Highness'  house become within a short time! The Danes had ruined the stables and  hunting-lodge, Anno 1628; _item_, destroyed several rooms in the castle;  and in the _locamentum_ of his Princely Highness Duke Philippus, where,  Anno 22, he so graciously entertained me and my child, as will be told  further on, now dwelt the innkeeper Nicolas Graeke; and all the fair  tapestries, whereon was represented the pilgrimage to Jerusalem of his  Princely Highness Bogislaus X, were torn down and the walls left grey  and bare. At this sight my heart was sorely grieved; but I presently  inquired for the merchants, who sat at the table drinking their parting  cup, with their travelling equipments already lying by them, seeing that  they were just going to set out on their way to Stettin; straightway one  of them jumped up from his liquor--a little fellow with a right noble  paunch and a black plaster on his nose--and asked me what I would of  them? I took him aside into a window, and told him I had some fine  amber, if he had a mind to buy it of me, which he straightway agreed to  do. And when he had whispered somewhat into the ear of his fellow, he  began to look very pleasant, and reached me the pitcher before we went  to my inn. I drank to him right heartily, seeing that (as I have already  said) I was still fasting, so that I felt my very heart warmed by it in  an instant. (Gracious God, what can go beyond a good draught of wine  taken within measure!) After this we went to my inn, and told the maid  to carry the box on one side into a small chamber. I had scarce opened  it and taken away the gown, when the man (whose name was Dieterich von  Pehnen, as he had told me by the way) held up both hands for joy, and  said he had never seen such wealth of amber, and how had I come by it? I  answered that my child had found it on the sea-shore; whereat he  wondered greatly that we had so much amber here, and offered me three  hundred florins for the whole box. I was quite beside myself for joy at  such an offer, but took care not to let him see it, and bargained with  him till I got five hundred florins, and I was to go with him to the  castle and take the money forthwith. Hereupon I ordered mine host to  make ready at once a mug of beer and a good dinner for my child, and  went back to the castle with the man and the maid, who carried the box,  begging him, in order to avoid common talk, to say nothing of my good  fortune to mine host, nor, indeed, to any one else in the town, and to  count out the money to me privately, seeing that I could not be sure  that the thieves might not lay in wait for me on the road home if they  heard of it, and this the man did; for he whispered something into the  ear of his fellow, who straightway opened his leathern surcoat, _item_  his doublet and hose, and unbuckled from his paunch a well-filled purse,  which he gave to him. _Summa_. Before long I had my riches in my pocket,  and, moreover, the man begged me to write to him at Amsterdam whenever I  found any more amber, the which I promised to do. But the worthy fellow  (as I have since heard) died of the plague at Stettin, together with his  companion--truly I wish it had happened otherwise. Shortly after I was  very near getting into great trouble; for, as I had an extreme longing  to fall on my knees, so that I could not wait until such time as I  should have got back to my inn, I went up three or four steps of the  castle stairs and entered into a small chamber, where I humbled myself  before the Lord. But the host, Nicolas Graeke, followed me, thinking I  was a thief, and would have stopped me, so that I knew not how to excuse  myself by saying that I had been made drunken by the wine which the  strange merchants had given to me (for he had seen what a good pull I  had made at it), seeing I had not broken my fast that morning, and that  I was looking for a chamber wherein I might sleep a while, which lie he  believed (if, in truth, it were a lie, for I was really drunken, though  not with wine, but with love and gratitude to my Maker), and accordingly  he let me go.    But I must now tell my story of his Princely Highness, as I promised  above. Anno 22, as I chanced to walk with my daughter, who was then a  child of about twelve years old, in the castle-garden at Wolgast, and was  showing her the beautiful flowers that grew there, it chanced that as we  came round from behind some bushes we espied my gracious lord the Duke  Philippus Julius,"]]]
