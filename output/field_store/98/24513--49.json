We have spoken of acquaintance with the contents of our minds as  _self_-consciousness, but it is not, of course, consciousness of our  _self_: it is consciousness of particular thoughts and feelings. The  question whether we are also acquainted with our bare selves, as opposed  to particular thoughts and feelings, is a very difficult one, upon which  it would be rash to speak positively. When we try to look into ourselves  we always seem to come upon some particular thought or feeling, and not  upon the 'I' which has the thought or feeling. Nevertheless there are  some reasons for thinking that we are acquainted with the 'I', though  the acquaintance is hard to disentangle from other things. To make clear  what sort of reason there is, let us consider for a moment what our  acquaintance with particular thoughts really involves.    When I am acquainted with 'my seeing the sun', it seems plain that I am  acquainted with two different things in relation to each other. On the  one hand there is the sense-datum which represents the sun to me, on the  other hand there is that which sees this sense-datum. All acquaintance,  such as my acquaintance with the sense-datum which represents the sun,  seems obviously a relation between the person acquainted and the object  with which the person is acquainted. When a case of acquaintance is one  with which I can be acquainted (as I am acquainted with my acquaintance  with the sense-datum representing the sun), it is plain that the person  acquainted is myself. Thus, when I am acquainted with my  seeing the sun, the whole fact with which I am acquainted is  'Self-acquainted-with-sense-datum'.    Further, we know the truth 'I am acquainted with this sense-datum'. It  is hard to see how we could know this truth, or even understand what is  meant by it, unless we were acquainted with something which we call 'I'.  It does not seem necessary to suppose that we are acquainted with a more  or less permanent person, the same to-day as yesterday, but it does seem  as though we must be acquainted with that thing, whatever its nature,  which sees the sun and has acquaintance with sense-data. Thus, in some  sense it would seem we must be acquainted with our Selves as opposed  to our particular experiences. But the question is difficult, and  complicated arguments can be adduced on either side. Hence, although  acquaintance with ourselves seems _probably_ to occur, it is not wise to  assert that it undoubtedly does occur.    We may therefore sum up as follows what has been said concerning  acquaintance with things that exist. We have acquaintance in sensation  with the data of the outer senses, and in introspection with the data of  what may be called the inner sense--thoughts, feelings, desires, etc.;  we have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either  of the outer senses or of the inner sense. Further, it is probable,  though not certain, that we have acquaintance with Self, as that which  is aware of things or has desires towards things.    In addition to our acquaintance with particular existing things, we also  have acquaintance with what we shall call _universals_, that is to say,  general ideas, such as _whiteness_, _diversity_, _brotherhood_, and so  on. Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands  for a universal, since all verbs have a meaning which is universal. We  shall return to universals later on, in Chapter IX; for the present, it  is only necessary to guard against the supposition that whatever we can  be acquainted with must be something particular and existent. Awareness  of universals is called _conceiving_, and a universal of which we are  aware is called a _concept_.    It will be seen that among the objects with which we are acquainted  are not included physical objects (as opposed to sense-data), nor other  people's minds. These things are known to us by what I call 'knowledge  by description', which we must now consider.    By a 'description' I mean any phrase of the form 'a so-and-so' or  'the so-and-so'. A phrase of the form 'a so-and-so' I shall call an  'ambiguous' description; a phrase of the form 'the so-and-so' (in the  singular) I shall call a 'definite' description. Thus 'a man' is an  ambiguous description, and 'the man with the iron mask' is a definite  description. There are various problems connected with ambiguous  descriptions, but I pass them by, since they do not directly concern  the matter we are discussing, which is the nature of our knowledge  concerning objects in cases where we know that there is an object  answering to a definite description, though we are not acquainted with  any such object. This is a matter which is concerned exclusively with  definite descriptions. I shall therefore, in the sequel, speak simply of  'descriptions' when I mean 'definite descriptions'. Thus a description  will mean any phrase of the form 'the so-and-so' in the singular.    We shall say that an object is 'known by description' when we know that  it is 'the so-and-so', i.e. when we know that there is one object, and  no more, having a certain property; and it will generally be implied  that we do not have knowledge of the same object by acquaintance. We  know that the man with the iron mask existed, and many propositions  are known about him; but we do not know who he was. We know that the  candidate who gets the most votes will be elected, and in this case we  are very likely also acquainted (in the only sense in which one can  be acquainted with some one else) with the man who is, in fact, the  candidate who will get most votes; but we do not know which of the  candidates he is, i.e. we do not know any proposition of the form 'A is  the candidate who will get most votes' where A is one of the candidates  by name. We shall say that we have 'merely descriptive knowledge' of the  so-and-so when, although we know that the so-and-so exists, and although  we may possibly be acquainted with the object which is, in fact, the  so-and-so, yet we do not know any proposition '_a_ is the so-and-so',  where _a_ is something with which we are acquainted.    When we say 'the so-and-so exists', we mean that there is just one  object which is the so-and-so. The proposition '_a_ is the so-and-so'  means that _a_ has the property so-and-so, and nothing else has. 'Mr.  A. is the Unionist candidate for this constituency' means 'Mr. A. is  a Unionist candidate for this constituency, and no one else is'. 'The  Unionist candidate for this constituency exists' means 'some one is a  Unionist candidate for this constituency, and no one else is'. Thus,  when we are acquainted with an object which is the so-and-so, we know  that the so-and-so exists; but we may know that the so-and-so exists  when we are not acquainted with any object which we know to be the  so-and-so, and even when we are not acquainted with any object which, in  fact, is the so-and-so.    Common words, even proper names, are usually really descriptions. That  is to say, the thought in the mind of a person using a proper name  correctly can generally only be expressed explicitly if we replace the  proper name by a description. Moreover, the description required to  express the thought will vary for different people, or for the same  person at different times. The only thing constant (so long as the name  is rightly used) is the object to which the name applies. But so long as  this remains constant, the particular description involved usually makes  no difference to the truth or falsehood of the proposition in which the  name appears.    Let us take some illustrations. Suppose some statement made about  Bismarck. Assuming that there is such a thing as direct acquaintance  with oneself, Bismarck himself might have used his name directly to  designate the particular person with whom he was acquainted. In this  case, if he made a judgement about himself, he himself might be a  constituent of the judgement. Here the proper name has the direct use  which it always wishes to have, as simply standing for a certain object,  and not for a description of the object. But if a person who knew  Bismarck made a judgement about him, the case is different. What this  person was acquainted with were certain sense-data which he connected  (rightly, we will suppose) with Bismarck's body. His body, as a physical  object, and still more his mind, were only known as the body and the  mind connected with these sense-data. That is, they were known by  description. It is, of course, very much a matter af chance which  characteristics of a man's appearance will come into a friend's mind  when he thinks of him; thus the description actually in the friend's  mind is accidental. The essential point is that he knows that the  various descriptions all apply to the same entity, in spite of not being  acquainted with the entity in question.    When we, who did not know Bismarck, make a judgement about him, the  description in our minds will probably be some more or less vague mass  of historical knowledge--far more, in most cases, than is required to  identify him. But, for the sake of illustration, let us assume that we  think of him as 'the first Chancellor of the German Empire'. Here all  the words are abstract except 'German'. The word 'German' will, again,  have different meanings for different people. To some it will recall  travels in Germany, to some the look of Germany on the map, and so on.  But if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable,  we shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a  particular with which we are acquainted. Such reference is involved in  any mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#8)"],[1," alternative I can think of----\"    At this point we were interrupted by the entrance of the servant, with  a message from Mr. Fairlie, intimating that he would be glad to see me,  as soon as I had done breakfast.    \"Wait in the hall,\" said Miss Halcombe, answering the servant for me,  in her quick, ready way.  \"Mr. Hartright will come out directly.  I was  about to say,\" she went on, addressing me again, \"that my sister and I  have a large collection of my mother's letters, addressed to my father  and to hers.  In the absence of any other means of getting information,  I will pass the morning in looking over my mother's correspondence with  Mr. Fairlie.  He was fond of London, and was constantly away from his  country home; and she was accustomed, at such times, to write and  report to him how things went on at Limmeridge.  Her letters are full  of references to the school in which she took so strong an interest;  and I think it more than likely that I may have discovered something  when we meet again.  The luncheon hour is two, Mr. Hartright.  I shall  have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister by that time, and we  will occupy the afternoon in driving round the neighbourhood and  showing you all our pet points of view.  Till two o'clock, then,  farewell.\"    She nodded to me with the lively grace, the delightful refinement of  familiarity, which characterised all that she did and all that she  said; and disappeared by a door at the lower end of the room. As soon  as she had left me, I turned my steps towards the hall, and followed  the servant, on my way, for the first time, to the presence of Mr.  Fairlie.        VII    My conductor led me upstairs into a passage which took us back to the  bedchamber in which I had slept during the past night; and opening the  door next to it, begged me to look in.    \"I have my master's orders to show you your own sitting-room, sir,\"  said the man, \"and to inquire if you approve of the situation and the  light.\"    I must have been hard to please, indeed, if I had not approved of the  room, and of everything about it.  The bow-window looked out on the  same lovely view which I had admired, in the morning, from my bedroom.  The furniture was the perfection of luxury and beauty; the table in the  centre was bright with gaily bound books, elegant conveniences for  writing, and beautiful flowers; the second table, near the window, was  covered with all the necessary materials for mounting water-colour  drawings, and had a little easel attached to it, which I could expand  or fold up at will; the walls were hung with gaily tinted chintz; and  the floor was spread with Indian matting in maize-colour and red.  It  was the prettiest and most luxurious little sitting-room I had ever  seen; and I admired it with the warmest enthusiasm.    The solemn servant was far too highly trained to betray the slightest  satisfaction.  He bowed with icy deference when my terms of eulogy were  all exhausted, and silently opened the door for me to go out into the  passage again.    We turned a corner, and entered a long second passage, ascended a short  flight of stairs at the end, crossed a small circular upper hall, and  stopped in front of a door covered with dark baize.  The servant opened  this door, and led me on a few yards to a second; opened that also, and  disclosed two curtains of pale sea-green silk hanging before us; raised  one of them noiselessly; softly uttered the words, \"Mr. Hartright,\" and  left me.    I found myself in a large, lofty room, with a magnificent carved  ceiling, and with a carpet over the floor, so thick and soft that it  felt like piles of velvet under my feet.  One side of the room was  occupied by a long book-case of some rare inlaid wood that was quite  new to me.  It was not more than six feet high, and the top was adorned  with statuettes in marble, ranged at regular distances one from the  other.  On the opposite side stood two antique cabinets; and between  them, and above them, hung a picture of the Virgin and Child, protected  by glass, and bearing Raphael's name on the gilt tablet at the bottom  of the frame.  On my right hand and on my left, as I stood inside the  door, were chiffoniers and little stands in buhl and marquetterie,  loaded with figures in Dresden china, with rare vases, ivory ornaments,  and toys and curiosities that sparkled at all points with gold, silver,  and precious stones.  At the lower end of the room, opposite to me, the  windows were concealed and the sunlight was tempered by large blinds of  the same pale sea-green colour as the curtains over the door.  The  light thus produced was deliciously soft, mysterious, and subdued; it  fell equally upon all the objects in the room; it helped to intensify  the deep silence, and the air of profound seclusion that possessed the  place; and it surrounded, with an appropriate halo of repose, the  solitary figure of the master of the house, leaning back, listlessly  composed, in a large easy-chair, with a reading-easel fastened on one  of its arms, and a little table on the other.    If a man's personal appearance, when he is out of his dressing-room,  and when he has passed forty, can be accepted as a safe guide to his  time of life--which is more than doubtful--Mr. Fairlie's age, when I  saw him, might have been reasonably computed at over fifty and under  sixty years.  His beardless face was thin, worn, and transparently  pale, but not wrinkled; his nose was high and hooked; his eyes were of  a dim greyish blue, large, prominent, and rather red round the rims of  the eyelids; his hair was scanty, soft to look at, and of that light  sandy colour which is the last to disclose its own changes towards  grey.  He was dressed in a dark frock-coat, of some substance much  thinner than cloth, and in waistcoat and trousers of spotless white.  His feet were effeminately small, and were clad in buff-coloured silk  stockings, and little womanish bronze-leather slippers.  Two rings  adorned his white delicate hands, the value of which even my  inexperienced observation detected to be all but priceless.  Upon the  whole, he had a frail, languidly-fretful, over-refined look--something  singularly and unpleasantly delicate in its association with a man,  and, at the same time, something which could by no possibility have  looked natural and appropriate if it had been transferred to the  personal appearance of a woman.  My morning's experience of Miss  Halcombe had predisposed me to be pleased with everybody in the house;  but my sympathies shut themselves up resolutely at the first sight of  Mr. Fairlie.    On approaching nearer to him, I discovered that he was not so entirely  without occupation as I had at first supposed.  Placed amid the other  rare and beautiful objects on a large round table near him, was a dwarf  cabinet in ebony and silver, containing coins of all shapes and sizes,  set out in little drawers lined with dark purple velvet.  One of these  drawers lay on the small table attached to his chair; and near it were  some tiny jeweller's brushes, a wash-leather \"stump,\" and a little  bottle of liquid, all waiting to be used in various ways for the  removal of any accidental impurities which might be discovered on the  coins.  His frail white fingers were listlessly toying with something  which looked, to my uninstructed eyes, like a dirty pewter medal with  ragged edges, when I advanced within a respectful distance of his  chair, and stopped to make my bow.    \"So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr. Hartright,\" he said in a  querulous, croaking voice, which combined, in anything but an agreeable  manner, a discordantly high tone with a drowsily languid utterance.  \"Pray sit down.  And don't trouble yourself to move the chair, please.  In the wretched state of my nerves, movement of any kind is exquisitely  painful to me.  Have you seen your studio? Will it do?\"    \"I have just come from seeing the room, Mr. Fairlie; and I assure  you----\"    He stopped me in the middle of the sentence, by closing his eyes, and  holding up one of his white hands imploringly.  I paused in  astonishment; and the croaking voice honoured me with this explanation--    \"Pray excuse me.  But could you contrive to speak in a lower key? In  the wretched state of my nerves, loud sound of any kind is  indescribable torture to me.  You will pardon an invalid? I only say to  you what the lamentable state of my health obliges me to say to  everybody.  Yes.  And you really like the room?\"    \"I could wish for nothing prettier and nothing more comfortable,\" I  answered, dropping my voice, and beginning to discover already that Mr.  Fairlie's selfish affectation and Mr. Fairlie's wretched nerves meant  one and the same thing.    \"So glad.  You will find your position here, Mr. Hartright, properly  recognised.  There is none of the horrid English barbarity of feeling  about the social position of an artist in this house.  So much of my  early life has been passed abroad, that I have quite cast my insular  skin in that respect.  I wish I could say the same of the  gentry--detestable word, but I suppose I must use it--of the gentry in  the neighbourhood. They are sad Goths in Art, Mr. Hartright.  People, I  do assure you, who would have opened their eyes in astonishment, if  they had seen Charles the Fifth pick up Titian's brush for him.  Do you  mind putting this tray of coins back in the cabinet, and giving me the  next one to it? In the wretched state of my nerves, exertion of any  kind is unspeakably disagreeable to me.  Yes.  Thank you.\"    As a practical commentary on the liberal social theory which he had  just favoured me by illustrating, Mr. Fairlie's cool request rather  amused me.  I put back one drawer and gave him the other, with all  possible politeness.  He began trifling with the new set of coins and  the little brushes immediately; languidly looking at them and admiring  them all the time he was"]]]
