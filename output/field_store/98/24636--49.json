I also said that, with all respect to  the bishop, it would have been better had he not inclined his ears  solely to the tale of his page, and that under the circumstances  it was scarcely wonderful that, being but a boy, you had defended  yourself when you were, as you deemed, unjustly accused.    \"The prelate sent at once for his page, who stoutly denied that he  had touched the hilt of his dagger, but I too had sent off for  Ulred, the armourer, and he brought with him a gossip who had also  been present. I asked the king's permission to introduce them, and  they entirely confirmed your story. Fitz-Urse exclaimed that it was  a Saxon plot to do him harm, and I could see that the bishop was  of the same opinion; but the king, who is ever anxious to do justice,  declared at once that he was sure that the two craftsmen were but  speaking the truth. He sternly rebuked Fitz-Urse as a liar, and  signified to the bishop that he would do well to punish him severely  by sending him back to Normandy, for that he would not tolerate his  presence at court--an order which the bishop obeyed with very bad  grace. But at any rate the lad was sent away by a ship a week later.    \"After the bishop had left the audience-chamber the king said that  he was afraid he had acted with harshness to you, as it seemed that  the fault was by no means wholly on your side, and that I could at  once recall you if I wished to do so. I thanked his majesty  dutifully, but said I thought it were best in all ways that for a  time you should remain away from court. In the first place, you  deserved some punishment for your want of respect for the bishop,  to whom you should have submitted yourself, even if you had thought  him unjust. In the second place, as Fitz-Urse had been sent away,  it would create an animosity against you on the part of his countrymen  at court were you to reappear at once; and lastly, that I considered  it would be to your benefit to pass at least some months on your  estates, learning your duties as thane, and making the acquaintance  of your people. Therefore, I wished you to continue at Steyning.  It will assuredly be pleasant for you to know that you are no longer  to be considered as being there in consequence of having fallen  under the king's displeasure, but simply because it is my wish that  you should for a time dwell among your people, and fit yourself to  be a wise lord to them.\"    Wulf was much pleased at the receipt of this letter, partly because  the fact that he had been sent away in disgrace stung him, and he  had felt obliged frankly to acknowledge to the neighbouring thanes  that he had been sent down on account of a quarrel with a Norman  page; but chiefly because it showed the kindly interest that Harold  felt in him, and that although absent he had still thought of him.    It was nigh ten months before he heard again. During that time he  had grown a good deal, and although he would never be tall, his  frame had so widened out that it was evident he would grow into an  exceptionally powerful man.    At sixteen he was still a boy, and although his position at Steyning,  where, although still under the nominal tutelage of the earl's  steward, he was practically lord and master, accustomed to play the  part of host within its walls, and that of feudal lord over the  wide estates, had given him the habits of authority and the bearing  of one who respected himself, the merry expression of his face,  aided by a slight upward turn of his nose, showed that in other  respects he was unchanged. He had learned with his weapons all that  Leof could teach him. He could wield a light battle-axe, and with  his sword could turn aside or sever an arrow however sharply shot  at him, provided that he had time to mark its flight. With a  quarter-staff he was a match for any youth on the estate, and he  could hurl a dart with unerring aim.    Osgod had sprung up into a powerful young fellow, taller than his  master by well-nigh a head, and his equal in exercises requiring  strength rather than quickness and skill. His duties at table had  been delegated to another, for there was a certain clumsiness in  Osgod's strength that no teaching could correct; and in his eagerness  to serve his master he so frequently spilled the contents of a cup,  or upset a platter, that even Egbert acknowledged that it was  hopeless to attempt to make a skilful servitor of him.    The earl's second letter contained only the words:    \"Come up to London as soon as you receive this. Leave Egbert in  charge of everything as before.\"    Although the time had not seemed long, and his occupations were so  varied that he had never felt dull since he had come down, Wulf was  delighted to receive the summons. He had, unconsciously to himself,  begun to feel restless, and to wonder whether Earl Harold had  altogether forgotten his existence.    \"We are going back to London, Osgod,\" he shouted.    \"I am right glad of it,\" the young giant said, stretching his arms  lazily. \"I am grievously tired of the country, and had it not been  that nothing would induce me to leave your service, I have thought  sometimes that I would gladly be back again in my father's smithy,  hammering away on hot iron. I used to think it would be the grandest  thing possible to have nothing to do, but I have found that one can  have too much of a good thing. Certainly I am glad to be going back,  but I am not sure whether it won't be worse at court than it is  here.\"    \"Perhaps we may not be staying there,\" Wulf said encouragingly.  \"Maybe the earl is going to start on some expedition; though we  have heard of no trouble, either in the North or in Wales. But even  if I stay at court, Osgod, you will often be able to be away, and  can spend some hours a day at the smithy, where, if you like, you  can take off your smock and belabour iron to your heart's content.  I should say you would be a rare help to your father, for, as Leof  says, for a downright solid blow there are not many men who could  surpass you.\"    Osgod laughed. \"Leof has not forgiven that blow I dealt him a month  ago, when I flattened in his helmet with my blunted axe and stretched  him senseless on the ground; in faith, I meant not to hit so hard,  but he had been taunting me with my slowness, and seeing an opening  for a blow at his head I could not resist it, and struck, as he was  always telling me to do, quickly.\"    \"You well-nigh killed him,\" Wulf said, shaking his head; \"he has  not taken an axe in his hand since, at least not with either of us.  He said to me the first time I invited him to a bout, it was high  time a man should give up teaching when he came to be struck senseless  by a boy.\"    \"Not much of a boy,\" Osgod replied, \"seeing that I stand over six  feet high, and got my muscles hardened early at the forge. However,  he bears me no ill-will; all he ever said to me on the matter was,  'I am glad to see that you can shake off your sluggishness sometimes,  Osgod; I should have been less earnest in my advice to you to strike  more quickly if I had thought that you were going to do it at my  expense. Keep those blows for your master's enemies, lad. If you  deal them to his friends you will lessen their number.'\"    \"Have my horse brought round at once, Osgod, have the wallets packed,  and be ready to start in an hour's time. I cannot go without riding  over to say good-bye to the prior and some of the monks. Do you,  when you have packed, follow me; it is not greatly out of the way,  and I shall meet you on the road. A short half-hour will suffice  for me there.\"    \"So Harold has sent for you, Wulf?\" the prior said, when the young  thane told him that he was on the point of starting for London.  \"'Tis as well. Come back when you may, you will now be fit to rule  at Steyning, and to rule well, but I foresee that we are likely to  have you but seldom down here. You are in good train to rise high  among Englishmen. You already possess the favour of Earl Harold,  who is, in all respects but name, King of England. You possess far  more learning than most young men of your rank, and as Harold rightly  thinks much of such knowledge, you are likely, if you live, to learn  more. But better than this, so far as your prospects are concerned  in the troubled times that may be coming, you are quick witted and  ready. I hear that you are already very proficient in arms, and a  match for most grown men. Best of all, so far as your future happiness  is concerned, you have a kind heart and a good disposition. You  could scarce be a page of Earl Harold's and not be a true Englishman  and patriot; therefore, my son, I think that I can predict a bright  and honourable future for you if Harold lives and reigns King of  England. Be steadfast and firm, lad. Act ever in what your heart  tells you is the right; be neither hasty nor quarrelsome. But,\"--he  broke off with a smile, \"you have had one lesson that way already.  Now I will detain you no longer. _Pax vobiscum_, may God keep  and guard you! If opportunity offer, and a messenger comes this  way, write me a few lines; news of you will be always welcome at  Bramber.\"    Leaving the prior, Wulf paid a hurried visit to the chambers where  the monks were engaged in their various avocations, and then started  at a canter and met Osgod coming along with a sumpter-horse carrying  the wallets, a store of provisions for the way, and Wulf's arms and  armour fastened to the crupper of his saddle.    \"You have done well, Osgod,\" Wulf said as he turned his horse, and  at a quieter pace proceeded beside him. \"I forgot to give you any  directions or to speak about your bringing a pack-horse with you,  but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#8)"],[1,". We have Daphnis and Bion,  Tityrus and Amyntas for characters, Sicilian valleys for scenery,  while Pan, Pales, and the Fauns represent the supernatural. The  shepherds defend their flocks from wolves and lions. But this  factitious bucolicism is pervaded by a pathos, which, like volcanic  heat, has fused into a new compound the dilapidated débris of the  Theocritean world. And in the Latin elegy there is more tenderness  than in the English. Charles Diodati was much nearer to Milton than  had been Edward King. The sorrow in _Lycidas_ is not so much personal  as it is the regret of the society of Christ's. King had only been  known to Milton as one of the students of the same college; Diodati  was the associate of his choice in riper manhood.    The _Epitaphium Damonis_ is further memorable as Milton's last attempt  in serious Latin verse. He discovered in this experiment that Latin  was not an adequate vehicle of the feeling he desired to give vent to.  In the concluding lines he takes a formal farewell of the Latian  muse, and announces his purpose of adopting henceforth the \"harsh and  grating Brittonic idiom\" (_Brittonicum stridens_).            _SECOND PERIOD_. 1640-1660.          CHAPTER IV.    EDUCATIONAL THEORY-TEACHING.      Milton was back in England in August, 1639. He had been absent a year  and three months, during which space of time the aspect of public  affairs, which had been perplexed and gloomy when he left, had been  growing still more ominous of a coming storm. The issues of the  controversy were so pervasive, that it was almost impossible for any  educated man who understood them not to range himself on a side. Yet  Milton, though he had broken off his projected tour in consequence,  did not rush into the fray on his return. He resumed his retired and  studious life, \"with no small delight, cheerfully leaving,\" as he  says, \"the event of public affairs first to God, and then to those to  whom the people had committed that task.\"    He did not return to Horton, but took lodgings in London, in the house  of Russel a tailor, in St. Bride's churchyard, at the city end of  Fleet-street, on the site of what is now Farringdon-street. There is  no attempt on the part of Milton to take up a profession, not even for  the sake of appearances. The elder Milton was content to provide the  son, of whom he was proud, with the means of prosecuting his eccentric  scheme of life, to continue, namely, to prepare himself for some great  work, nature unknown.    For a young man of simple habits and studious life a little suffices.  The chief want is books, and of these, for Milton's style of reading,  select rather than copious, a large collection is superfluous. There  were in 1640 no public libraries in London, and a scholar had to find  his own store of books or to borrow from his friends. Milton never  can have possessed a large library. At Horton he may have used  Kederminster's bequest to Langley Church. Still, with his Italian  acquisitions, added to the books that he already possessed, he soon  found a lodging too narrow for his accommodation, and removed to a  house of his own, \"a pretty garden-house, in Aldersgate, at the end of  an entry.\" Aldersgate was outside the city walls, on the verge of the  open country of Islington, and was a genteel though not a fashionable  quarter. There were few streets in London, says Phillips, more free  from noise.    He had taken in hand the education of his two nephews, John and Edward  Phillips, sons of his only sister Anne. Anne was a few years older  than her brother John. Her first husband, Edward Phillips, had died in  1631, and the widow had given her two sons a stepfather in one Thomas  Agar, who was in the Clerk of the Crown's office. Milton, on settling  in London in 1639, had at once taken his younger nephew John to live  with him. When, in 1640, he removed to Aldersgate, the elder, Edward,  also came under his roof.    If it was affection for his sister which first moved Milton to  undertake the tuition of her sons, he soon developed a taste for the  occupation. In 1643 he began to receive into his house other pupils,  but only, says Phillips (who is solicitous that his uncle should not  be thought to have kept a school), \"the sons of some gentlemen that  were his intimate friends.\" He threw into his lessons the same energy  which he carried into everything else. In his eagerness to find a  place for everything that could be learnt, there could have been few  hours in the day which were not invaded by teaching. He had exchanged  the contemplative leisure of Horton for a busy life, in which no hour  but had its calls. Even on Sundays there were lessons in the Greek  Testament and dictations of a system of Divinity in Latin. His  pamphlets of this period betray, in their want of measure and  equilibrium, even in their heated style and passion-flushed language,  the life at high pressure which their author was leading.    We have no account of Milton's method of teaching from any competent  pupil. Edward Phillips was an amiable and upright man, who earned his  living respectably by tuition and the compilation of books. He held  his uncle's memory in great veneration. But when he comes to  describe the education he received at his uncle's hands, the only  characteristic on which he dwells is that of quantity. Phillips's  account is, however, supplemented for us by Milton's written theory.  His _Tractate of Education to Master Samuel Hartlib_ is probably known  even to those who have never looked at anything else of Milton's in  prose.    Of all the practical arts, that of education seems the most cumbrous  in its method, and to be productive of the smallest results with the  most lavish expenditure of means. Hence the subject of education is  one which is always luring on the innovator and the theorist.  Every one, as he grows up, becomes aware of time lost, and effort  misapplied, in his own case. It is not unnatural to desire to save our  children from a like waste of power. And in a time such as was that  of Milton's youth, when all traditions were being questioned, and all  institutions were to be remodelled, it was certain that the school  would be among the earliest objects to attract an experimental  reformer. Among the advanced minds of the time there had grown up a  deep dissatisfaction with the received methods of our schools, and  more especially of our universities. The great instaurator of all  knowledge, Bacon, in preaching the necessity of altering the whole  method of knowing, included as matter of course the method of teaching  to know.    The man who carried over the Baconian aspiration into education was  Comenius (d. 1670). A projector and enthusiast, Comenius desired, like  Bacon, an entirely new intellectual era. With Bacon's intellectual  ambition, but without Bacon's capacity, Comenius proposed to  revolutionise all knowledge, and to make complete wisdom accessible to  all, in a brief space of time, and with a minimum of labour. Language  only as an instrument, not as an end in itself; many living languages,  instead of the one dead language of the old school; a knowledge of  things, instead of words; the free use of our eyes and ears upon the  nature that surrounds us; intelligent apprehension, instead of loading  the memory--all these doctrines, afterwards inherited by the party  of rational reform, were first promulgated in Europe by the numerous  pamphlets--some ninety have been reckoned up--of this Teuto-Slav,  Comenius.    Comenius had as the champion of his views in England Samuel Hartlib,  a Dantziger by origin, settled in London since 1628. Hartlib had even  less of real science than Comenius, but he was equally possessed by  the Baconian ideal of a new heaven and a new earth of knowledge. Not  himself a discoverer in any branch, he was unceasingly occupied in  communicating the discoveries and inventions of others. He had an ear  for every novelty of whatever kind, interesting himself in social,  religious, philanthropic schemes, as well as in experiments in the  arts. A sanguine universality of benevolence pervaded that generation  of ardent souls, akin only in their common anticipation of an unknown  Utopia. A secret was within the reach of human ingenuity which would  make all mankind happy. But there were two directions more especially  in which Hartlib's zeal without knowledge abounded. These were a grand  scheme for the union of Protestant Christendom, and his propagand of  Comenius's school-reform.    For the first of these projects it was not likely that Hartlib would  gain a proselyte in Milton, who had at one-and-twenty judged Anglican  orders a servitude, and was already chafing against the restraints of  Presbytery. But on his other hobby, that of school-reform, Milton was  not only sympathetic, but when Hartlib came to talk with him, he  found that most or all of Comenius's ideas had already independently  presented themselves to the reflection or experience of the  Englishman. At Hartlib's request Milton consented to put down his  thoughts on paper, and even to print them in a quarto pamphlet of  eight pages, entitled, _Of Education: to Master Samuel Hartlib_.    This tract, often reproduced and regarded, along with one of Locke's,  as a substantial contribution to the subject, must often have  grievously disappointed those who have eagerly consulted it for  practical hints or guidance of any kind. Its interest is wholly  biographical. It cannot be regarded as a valuable contribution to  educational theory, but it is strongly marked with the Miltonic  individuality. We find in it the same lofty conception of the aim  which Milton carried into everything he attempted; the same disdain of  the beaten routine, and proud reliance upon his own resources. He had  given vent elsewhere to his discontent with the system of Cambridge,  \"which, as in the time of her better health, and mine own younger  judgment, I"]]]
