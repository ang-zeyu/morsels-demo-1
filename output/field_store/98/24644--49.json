The pier was presently crowded with people gazing at our vessel, as  if she presented a spectacle perfectly novel: but, except the  tri-coloured cockade in the hats of the military, I could not observe  the smallest difference in their general appearance. Instead of crops  and round wigs, which I expected to see in universal vogue, here were  full as many powdered heads and long queues as before the revolution.  Frenchmen, in general, will, I am persuaded, ever be Frenchmen in  their dress, which, in my opinion, can never be _revolutionized_,  either by precept or example. The _citoyens_, as far as I am yet able  to judge, most certainly have not fattened by warfare more than JOHN  BULL: their visages are as sallow and as thin as formerly, though  their persons are not quite so meagre as they are pourtrayed by  Hogarth.    The prospect of peace, however, seemed to have produced an  exhilarating effect on all ranks; satisfaction appeared on every  countenance. According to custom, a host of inkeepers' domestics  boarded the vessel, each vaunting the superiority of his master's  accommodations. My old landlord Ducrocq presenting himself to  congratulate me on my arrival, soon freed me from their  importunities, and I, of course, decided in favour of the _Lion  d'Argent_.    Part of the _Boulogne_ flotilla was lying in the harbour.  Independently of the decks of the gunboats being full of soldiers,  with very few sailors intermixed, playing at different games of  chance, not a plank, not a log, or piece of timber, was there on the  quay but was also covered with similar parties. This then accounts  for that rage for gambling, which has carried to such desperate  lengths those among them whom the fate of war has lodged in our  prisons.    My attention was soon diverted from this scene, by a polite answer  from the commissary, inviting me to his house. I instantly  disembarked to wait on him; my letter containing nothing more than an  introduction, accompanied by a request that I might be furnished with  a passport to enable me to proceed to Paris without delay, Citizen  Mengaud dispatched a proper person to attend me to the town-hall,  where the passports are made out, and signed by the mayor; though  they are not delivered till they have also received the commissary's  signature. However, to lose no time, while one of the clerks was  drawing my picture, or, in other words, taking down a minute  description of my person, I sent my keys to the custom-house, in  order that my baggage might be examined.    By what conveyance I was to proceed to Paris was the next point to be  settled; and this has brought me to the _Lion d'Argent_.    Among other vehicles, Ducrocq has, in his _remise_, an  apparently-good _cabriolet de voyage_, belonging to one of his Paris  correspondents; but, on account of the wretched state of the roads,  he begs me to allow him time to send for his coachmaker, to examine  it scrupulously, that I may not be detained by the way, from any  accident happening to the carriage.    I was just on the point of concluding my letter, when a French naval  officer, who was on the pier when I landed, introduced himself to me,  to know whether I would do him the favour to accommodate him with a  place in the cabriolet under examination. I liked my new friend's  appearance and manner too well not to accede to his proposal.    The carriage is reported to be in good condition. I shall therefore  send my servant on before as a courier, instead of taking him with me  as an inside passenger. As we shall travel night and day, and the  post-horses will be in readiness at every stage, we may, I am told,  expect to reach Paris in about forty-two hours. Adieu; my next will  be from the _great_ city.        LETTER II.    _Paris, October 19, 1801._    Here I am safe arrived; that is, without any broken bones; though my  arms, knees, and head are finely pummelled by the jolting of the  carriage. Well might Ducrocq say that the roads were bad! In several  places, they are not passable without danger--Indeed, the government  is so fully aware of this, that an inspector has been dispatched to  direct immediate repairs to be made against the arrival of the  English ambassador; and, in some _communes_, the people are at work  by torch-light. With this exception, my journey was exceedingly  pleasant. At ten o'clock the first night, we reached _Montreuil_,  where we supped; the next day we breakfasted at _Abbeville_, dined at  _Amiens_, and supped that evening at _Clermont_.    The road between _Calais_ and _Paris_ is too well known to interest  by description. Most of the abbeys and monasteries, which present  themselves to the eye of the traveller, have either been converted  into hospitals or manufactories. Few there are, I believe, who will  deny that this change is for the better. A receptacle for the relief  of suffering indigence conveys a consolatory idea to the mind of the  friend of human nature; while the lover of industry cannot but  approve of an establishment which, while it enriches a State, affords  employ to the needy and diligent. This, unquestionably, is no bad  appropriation of these buildings, which, when inhabited by monks,  were, for the most part, no more than an asylum of sloth, hypocrisy,  pride, and ignorance.    The weather was fine, which contributed not a little to display the  country to greater advantage; but the improvements recently made in  agriculture are too striking to escape the notice of the most  inattentive observer. The open plains and rising grounds of  _ci-devant Picardy_ which, from ten to fifteen years ago, I have  frequently seen, in this season, mostly lying fallow, and presenting  the aspect of one wide, neglected waste, are now all well cultivated,  and chiefly laid down in corn; and the corn, in general, seems to  have been sown with more than common attention.    My fellow-traveller, who was a _lieutenant de vaisseau_, belonging to  _Latouche Tréville's_ flotilla, proved a very agreeable companion,  and extremely well-informed. This officer positively denied the  circumstance of any of their gun-boats being moored with chains  during our last attack. While he did ample justice to the bravery of  our people, he censured the manner in which it had been exerted. The  divisions of boats arriving separately, he said, could not afford to  each other necessary support, and were thus exposed to certain  discomfiture. I made the best defence I possibly could; but truth  bears down all before it.    The loss on the side of the French, my fellow-traveller declared, was  no more than seven men killed and forty-five wounded. Such of the  latter as were in a condition to undergo the fatigue of the ceremony,  were carried in triumphal procession through the streets of  _Boulogne_, where, after being harangued by the mayor, they were  rewarded with civic crowns from the hands of their fair  fellow-citizens.    Early the second morning after our departure from _Calais_, we  reached the town of _St. Denis_, which, at one time since the  revolution, changed its name for that of _Françiade_. I never pass  through this place without calling to mind the persecution which poor  Abélard suffered from Adam, the abbot, for having dared to say, that  the body of _St. Denis_, first bishop of Paris, in 240, which had  been preserved in this abbey among the relics, was not that of the  areopagite, who died in 95. The ridiculous stories, imposed on the  credulity of the zealous catholics, respecting this wonderful saint,  have been exhibited in their proper light by Voltaire, as you may see  by consulting the _Questions sur l'Encyclopédie_, at the article  _Denis_.    It is in every person's recollection that, in consequence of the  National Convention having decreed the abolition of royalty in  France, it was proposed to annihilate every vestige of it throughout  the country. But, probably, you are not aware of the thorough sweep  that was made among the sepultures in this abbey of _St. Denis_.    The bodies of the kings, queens, princes, princesses, and celebrated  personages, who had been interred here for nearly fifteen hundred  years, were taken up, and literally reduced to ashes. Not a wreck was  left behind to make a relic.    The remains of TURENNE alone were respected. All the other bodies,  together with the entrails or hearts, enclosed in separate urns, were  thrown into large pits, lined with a coat of quick lime: they were  then covered with the same substance; and the pits were afterwards  filled up with earth. Most of them, as may be supposed, were in a  state of complete putrescency; of some, the bones only remained,  though a few were in good preservation.    The bodies of the consort of Charles I. Henrietta Maria of France,  daughter of Henry IV, who died in 1669, aged 60, and of their  daughter Henrietta Stuart, first wife of Monsieur, only brother to  Lewis XIV, who died in 1670, aged 26, both interred in the vault of  the Bourbons, were consumed in the general destruction.    The execution of this decree was begun at _St. Denis_ on Saturday the  12th of October 1793, and completed on the 25th of the same month, in  presence of the municipality and several other persons.    On the 12th of November following, all the treasure of _St. Denis_,  (shrines, relics, &c.) was removed: the whole was put into large  wooden chests, together with all the rich ornaments of the church,  consisting of chalices, pyxes, cups, copes, &c. The same day these  valuable articles were sent off, in great state, in waggons,  decorated for the purpose, to the National Convention.    We left _St. Denis_ after a hasty breakfast; and, on reaching Paris,  I determined to drive to the residence of a man whom I had never  seen; but from whom I had little doubt of a welcome reception.

The blood  of a fellow man was upon his hands--in his morbid reflections he had  long since ceased to attribute the death of Condon to the ape.  The  hysteria of panic had fastened the guilt upon himself.  With money he  might have bought justice; but penniless!--ah, what hope could there be  for strangers without money here?    But what had become of the money?  He tried to recall when last he had  seen it.  He could not, nor, could he, would he have been able to  account for its disappearance, for he had been entirely unconscious of  the falling of the little package from his pocket into the sea as he  clambered over the ship's side into the waiting canoe that bore him to  shore.    Now he turned toward Akut.  \"Come!\" he said, in the language of the  great apes.    Forgetful of the fact that he wore only a thin pajama suit he led the  way to the open window.  Thrusting his head out he listened  attentively.  A single tree grew a few feet from the window.  Nimbly  the lad sprang to its bole, clinging cat-like for an instant before he  clambered quietly to the ground below.  Close behind him came the great  ape.  Two hundred yards away a spur of the jungle ran close to the  straggling town.  Toward this the lad led the way.  None saw them, and  a moment later the jungle swallowed them, and John Clayton, future Lord  Greystoke, passed from the eyes and the knowledge of men.    It was late the following morning that a native houseman knocked upon  the door of the room that had been assigned to Mrs. Billings and her  grandson.  Receiving no response he inserted his pass key in the lock,  only to discover that another key was already there, but from the  inside.  He reported the fact to Herr Skopf, the proprietor, who at  once made his way to the second floor where he, too, pounded vigorously  upon the door.  Receiving no reply he bent to the key hole in an  attempt to look through into the room beyond.  In so doing, being  portly, he lost his balance, which necessitated putting a palm to the  floor to maintain his equilibrium.  As he did so he felt something soft  and thick and wet beneath his fingers.  He raised his open palm before  his eyes in the dim light of the corridor and peered at it.  Then he  gave a little shudder, for even in the semi-darkness he saw a dark red  stain upon his hand.  Leaping to his feet he hurled his shoulder  against the door.  Herr Skopf is a heavy man--or at least he was  then--I have not seen him for several years.  The frail door collapsed  beneath his weight, and Herr Skopf stumbled precipitately into the room  beyond.    Before him lay the greatest mystery of his life.  Upon the floor at his  feet was the dead body of a strange man.  The neck was broken and the  jugular severed as by the fangs of a wild beast.  The body was entirely  naked, the clothing being strewn about the corpse.  The old lady and  her grandson were gone.  The window was open.  They must have  disappeared through the window for the door had been locked from the  inside.    But how could the boy have carried his invalid grandmother from a  second story window to the ground?  It was preposterous.  Again Herr  Skopf searched the small room.  He noticed that the bed was pulled well  away from the wall--why?  He looked beneath it again for the third or  fourth time.  The two were gone, and yet his judgment told him that the  old lady could not have gone without porters to carry her down as they  had carried her up the previous day.    Further search deepened the mystery.  All the clothing of the two was  still in the room--if they had gone then they must have gone naked or  in their night clothes.  Herr Skopf shook his head; then he scratched  it.  He was baffled.  He had never heard of Sherlock Holmes or he would  have lost no time in invoking the aid of that celebrated sleuth, for  here was a real mystery:  An old woman--an invalid who had to be  carried from the ship to her room in the hotel--and a handsome lad, her  grandson, had entered a room on the second floor of his hostelry the  day before.  They had had their evening meal served in their room--that  was the last that had been seen of them.  At nine the following morning  the corpse of a strange man had been the sole occupant of that room.  No boat had left the harbor in the meantime--there was not a railroad  within hundreds of miles--there was no other white settlement that the  two could reach under several days of arduous marching accompanied by a  well-equipped safari.  They had simply vanished into thin air, for the  native he had sent to inspect the ground beneath the open window had  just returned to report that there was no sign of a footstep there, and  what sort of creatures were they who could have dropped that distance  to the soft turf without leaving spoor?  Herr Skopf shuddered.  Yes, it  was a great mystery--there was something uncanny about the whole  thing--he hated to think about it, and he dreaded the coming of night.    It was a great mystery to Herr Skopf--and, doubtless, still is.          Chapter 5      Captain Armand Jacot of the Foreign Legion sat upon an outspread saddle  blanket at the foot of a stunted palm tree.  His broad shoulders and  his close-cropped head rested in luxurious ease against the rough bole  of the palm.  His long legs were stretched straight before him  overlapping the meager blanket, his spurs buried in the sandy soil of  the little desert oasis.  The captain was taking his ease after a long  day of weary riding across the shifting sands of the desert.    Lazily he puffed upon his cigarette and watched his orderly who was  preparing his evening meal.  Captain Armand Jacot was well satisfied  with himself and the world.  A little to his right rose the noisy  activity of his troop of sun-tanned veterans, released for the time  from the irksome trammels of discipline, relaxing tired muscles,  laughing, joking, and smoking as they, too, prepared to eat after a  twelve-hour fast.  Among them, silent and taciturn, squatted five  white-robed Arabs, securely bound and under heavy guard.    It was the sight of these that filled Captain Armand Jacot with the  pleasurable satisfaction of a duty well-performed.  For a long, hot,  gaunt month he and his little troop had scoured the places of the  desert waste in search of a band of marauders to the sin-stained  account of which were charged innumerable thefts of camels, horses, and  goats, as well as murders enough to have sent the whole unsavory gang  to the guillotine several times over.    A week before, he had come upon them.  In the ensuing battle he had  lost two of his own men, but the punishment inflicted upon the  marauders had been severe almost to extinction.  A half dozen, perhaps,  had escaped; but the balance, with the exception of the five prisoners,  had expiated their crimes before the nickel jacketed bullets of the  legionaries.  And, best of all, the ring leader, Achmet ben Houdin, was  among the prisoners.    From the prisoners Captain Jacot permitted his mind to traverse the  remaining miles of sand to the little garrison post where, upon the  morrow, he should find awaiting him with eager welcome his wife and  little daughter.  His eyes softened to the memory of them, as they  always did.  Even now he could see the beauty of the mother reflected  in the childish lines of little Jeanne's face, and both those faces  would be smiling up into his as he swung from his tired mount late the  following afternoon.  Already he could feel a soft cheek pressed close  to each of his--velvet against leather.    His reverie was broken in upon by the voice of a sentry summoning a  non-commissioned officer.  Captain Jacot raised his eyes.  The sun had  not yet set; but the shadows of the few trees huddled about the water  hole and of his men and their horses stretched far away into the east  across the now golden sand.  The sentry was pointing in this direction,  and the corporal, through narrowed lids, was searching the distance.  Captain Jacot rose to his feet.  He was not a man content to see  through the eyes of others.  He must see for himself.  Usually he saw  things long before others were aware that there was anything to see--a  trait that had won for him the sobriquet of Hawk.  Now he saw, just  beyond the long shadows, a dozen specks rising and falling among the  sands.  They disappeared and reappeared, but always they grew larger.  Jacot recognized them immediately.  They were horsemen--horsemen of the  desert.  Already a sergeant was running toward him.  The entire camp  was straining its eyes into the distance.  Jacot gave a few terse  orders to the sergeant who saluted, turned upon his heel and returned  to the men.  Here he gathered a dozen who saddled their horses, mounted  and rode out to meet the strangers.  The remaining men disposed  themselves in readiness for instant action.  It was not entirely beyond  the range of possibilities that the horsemen riding thus swiftly toward  the camp might be friends of the prisoners bent upon the release of  their kinsmen by a sudden attack.  Jacot doubted this, however, since  the strangers were evidently making no attempt to conceal their  presence.  They were galloping rapidly toward the camp in plain view of  all.  There might be treachery lurking beneath their fair appearance;  but none who knew The Hawk would be so gullible as to hope to trap him  thus.    The sergeant with his detail met the Arabs two hundred yards from the  camp.  Jacot could see him in conversation with a tall, white-robed  figure--evidently the leader of the band.  Presently the sergeant and  this Arab rode side by side toward camp.  Jacot awaited them.  The two  reined in and dismounted before him.    \"Sheik Amor ben Khatour,\" announced the sergeant by way of introduction.    Captain Jacot eyed the newcomer.  He was acquainted with nearly every  principal"]]]
