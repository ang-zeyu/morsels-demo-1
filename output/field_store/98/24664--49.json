I solemnly  protest that I do not go over to the Romans as a deserter, but as Thy  minister.\"    It may be that Josephus really believed he had prophetic powers, and  thought he was imitating the great prophets of Israel and Judah who had  proclaimed the uselessness of resistance to Assyria and Babylon. But  they, while denouncing the wickedness of the people, had shared their  lot with them. And Josephus, who weakly sought a refuge for himself  after defeat, resembles rather the prophets whom Jeremiah denounced:  \"They speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the  Lord. They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye  shall have peace; and they say unto everyone that walketh after the  imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.\"[1] His  comrades however prevented him from giving himself up, and called on him  to play a braver part and die with them, each by his own hand. He put  them off by talking philosophically, as he has it, about the sin of  suicide, a euphemism for a collection of commonplaces on the duty of  preserving their lives. But when this enraged them, he bethought him of  another device, and proposed that they should cast lots to kill each  other. They assented, and by Divine Providence he was left to the last  with one other, whom he persuaded to break his oath and live  likewise.[2] Having thus escaped, he was led by Nicanor to Vespasian,  the whole Roman army gathering around to gaze on the hero. Continuing  his prophetical function, when he found that he was like to be sent to  Nero, he announced to Vespasian, \"Thou art Caesar and Emperor, thou, and  this thy son.... thou art not only lord over me, but over the land and  the sea and all mankind.\" The Roman general was incredulous, till,  hearing that his prisoner had foretold the length of the siege of  Jotapata--a prophecy which, of course, he had the ability to fulfil--and  further, on the report of the death of Nero, having conceived the  possibility of becoming Emperor, he had regard to the Jewish prophet,  and, without setting him at liberty, bestowed favors on him, and made  him easy about his future. Such was the end of the military career of  Josephus.    [Footnote 1: Jer. 23: 16-17.]    [Footnote 2: A charitable explanation of this self-debasing account of  Josephus is that he was driven to invent some story to extenuate his  resistance to the Romans, and had to blacken his reputation as a patriot  to save his skin. The fact that he was kept prisoner some time by  Vespasian suggests that he was not so big a traitor as he pretends.]    The Talmud relates that Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, the head of the  Pharisees, was carried in a coffin outside the walls of Jerusalem by his  disciples, and was brought to the Roman camp, where he hailed Vespasian  as Emperor and Caesar, and thereby gained his favor. If not apocryphal,  the event must have happened in 69 C.E., when the Roman commander was  generally expected to aim at the Imperial throne, then the object of  strife between rival commanders. The rabbi belonged to the peace party,  and from the beginning had opposed the war. And though his action was  disapproved by the later generations, it was justified by his subsequent  conduct; for it was he who, by founding the famous college at Jabneh,  kept alive the Jewish spirit after the fall of the nation. For him  surrender was a valid means to the preservation of the nation. The  action of Josephus hardly bears the same justification. His desire for  self-preservation was natural enough, but his manner of effecting it was  not honorable. He was a general who, having taken a lead in the struggle  for independence, had seen all his men fall, and had at the end invited  the last of his comrades to kill each other, and he saved his life by  sacrificing his honor. His mind was from the beginning of the struggle  subjugated to Rome, but unhappily he accepted the most responsible post  in the national defense and betrayed it. His address to Vespasian was  mere flattery, designed to impose on a superstitious man's credulity;  for the ear of Vespasian, says Merivale, \"was always open to pretenders  to supernatural knowledge.\" Lastly Josephus used his safety, not for the  purpose of preserving the Jewish heritage, but for personal ends. He  became a flunkey of the Flavian house, and straightway started on the  transformation from a Jewish priest and soldier into a Roman courtier  and literary hireling. Hard circumstances compelled him to choose  between a noble and an ignoble part, between heroic action and weak  submission. He was a mediocre man, and chose the way that was not heroic  and glorious. Posterity gained something by his choice; his own  reputation was fatally marred by it.          III    THE LIFE OF JOSEPHUS FROM THE TIME OF HIS SURRENDER      Josephus was little more than thirty years old at the time of his  surrender. At an age when men usually begin to realize their ambition  and ideal, his whole life's course was changed: he had to abandon all  his old associations, and accommodate himself to a different and indeed  a hostile society. Henceforth he was a liege of the Roman conqueror, and  had to submit to be Romanized not only in name but in spirit. His  condition was indeed a thinly-disguised servitude. The Romans were an  imperious as well as an Imperial people, and though in some  circumstances they were ready to spare the lives of those who yielded,  they required of them a surrender of opinion and an abasement of soul.  For the rest of his years, which comprehended the whole of his literary  activity, Josephus was not therefore a free man. He acted, spoke, and  wrote to order, compelled, whenever called upon, to do the will of his  masters. His legal condition was first that of a _libertus_ (a freedman)  of Vespasian, and as such he owed by law certain definite obligations to  his patron's family. But the moral subservience of the favored prisoner  of a subjugated people must have been a far profounder thing than the  legal obligation arising from his status; and this enforced moral and  mental subservience is a cardinal point to be remembered in forming a  judgment upon Josephus. His expressed opinions are often not the  revelation of his own mind, but the galling tribute which he was  compelled to pay for his life. And apart from the involuntary and  undeliberate adoption of Roman standards, which, living isolated from  Jewish life in Rome, he could not escape, he had in writing, and no  doubt in conversation, deliberately and consciously to assume the  deepest-seated of the Roman prejudices towards his own people. Liberty  has been defined as the power of a man to call his soul his own. And in  that sense Josephus emphatically did not possess liberty. We must be on  our guard, therefore, against regarding him as an independent historian,  much less as writing from an independent Jewish point of view. From the  time of his surrender till his death he lived and wrote as the client of  the Flavian house, and all his works had to pass the Imperial  censorship.    His domestic life is characteristic of his subservience. At the bidding  of Vespasian, when in the Roman camp at Caesarea, he divorced his first  wife, who was locked up in Jerusalem during the siege. Though by Jewish  law it was forbidden to a priest to marry a captive woman, he took as  his second wife a Jewess that had been brought into the Roman camp.  Having no children by her, he divorced her after a year, and married  again at Alexandria. By his third wife he had three sons, but with a  Roman's carelessness of the marriage bond he divorced her late in life,  and married finally a noble Jewess of Crete, by whom he had two more  sons, Justus and Simon Agrippa. His last two wives, be it noted, came  from Hellenistic-Jewish communities, and were doubtless able to assist  him in acquiring Greek.    The public as well as the domestic life of Josephus was controlled by  the Roman commander. Till the end of the Jewish struggle it followed the  progress of the Roman arms. He continued to play an active part in the  war, not, however, as a leader of the Jews, but as the adviser of their  enemies. He was attached to the staff of Titus, and after witnessing the  fall of the two fortresses of Galilee, Gamala and Gischala, which held  out bravely under John after the capture of Jotapata, he accompanied the  Roman at the end of the year 68 to Alexandria. There he spent a year,  till a change of fortune came to him.    During the year 68, Vespasian captured the two chief cities which the  Jewish national party held to the east side of the Jordan, Gadara and  Gerasa. He then prepared to lay siege to Jerusalem. But hearing of the  death of Nero and of the chaos at Rome that followed it, he stayed  operations to await events in Italy. In the following year, largely by  the aid of the Jewish apostate Tiberius Alexander, he secured the  allegiance of all the Eastern legions, and was proclaimed Emperor. Three  other generals laid claim to the same dignity, under the same title of  armed force, but in the end Vespasian's friends in Italy made themselves  masters of Rome, and he repaired himself to the capital and donned the  purple. Josephus was rewarded with his complete freedom, and assumed  henceforth the family name of his Imperial patrons. When, at the end of  the year 69, Titus was appointed by his father to finish the war, he  accompanied him back to Palestine. In the eighteen months' respite that  had been vouchsafed to them, the Jews had spent their energy and  undermined their powers of resistance by internecine strife. According  to the account in the _Wars_, which unfortunately is the only full  record we have of events, John of Gischala, fleeing to Jerusalem after  the fall of the Galilean fortresses, roused "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#8)"],[1,"his ways as he is in that one eye, which is so like a  hard-boiled egg. You see, Lord Ernest, we're going to have a boat of  our own. A steam dahabeah is what we want, so we won't be at the mercy  of the wind. And we can have all the dragomen we choose, can't we?\"    \"I suppose you can fill up your cabins with them,\" I agreed, because I  felt that the Gilded Rose wished me to argue the point, and that if I  did I should be worsted. As I should not be on board the dahabeah in  question, it would not matter to me personally if the boat were  entirely manned by dragomans. Except that there would in that case  probably be a collision, and I should not be near to save Biddy--and  incidentally the girl Biddy wished me to marry.    After that, we went on eating our dinner and talking of Egypt, Miss  Guest doing all the listening, as usual. When we had finished, we kept  our places because we had no others. Cleopatra was curious about my  friend's failure to arrive, but I put her off with vaguenesses; and  said to myself that, for Anthony's sake, it was well that mysterious  business had kept him in Cairo. Still, I wondered what the business  was: why he would be unable to see me that night: and what were the  \"many things\" he had to tell.          CHAPTER IV    A MAN IN A GREEN TURBAN      I shall never know for certain whether or not our future was entirely  shaped by Monny's resolve to breakfast on the terrace of Shepheard's  Hotel next morning.    A great many remarkable things have happened on that historic site.  Napoleon made the place his headquarters. General Kleber was murdered  in the garden. Half the most important people in the world have had tea  on the terrace: but, according to a German waiter, there was one deed  yet undone. Nobody had ever ordered breakfast out of doors.    Of course, Monny got what she wanted. Not by storming, not by putting  on power-of-wealth airs, but simply by turning bright pink and looking  large-eyed. At once that waiter rushed off, and fetched other waiters;  and almost before the invited guests knew what to expect, two tables  had been fitted together, covered with white, adorned with fresh roses,  and set forth with cups and saucers. I was the one man invited, and I  felt like an actor called to play a new part in an old scene, a scene  vaguely, excitingly familiar. Could I possibly be remembering it, I  asked myself, or was my impression but the result of a life-long  debauch of Egyptian photographs? Anyhow, there was the impression, with  a thrill in it; and I felt that I ought to be handsomer, more romantic,  altogether more vivid, if I were to live up to the moving picture. It  seemed as if nothing would be too extraordinary to do, if I wanted to  match my surroundings. I thought, even if I burst into a passionate  Arab love-song and proposed to Monny across the table, it would be  quite the right note. But somehow I didn't feel inclined to propose. It  was enough to admire her over the rim of a coffee cup. In her white  tussore (I heard Biddy call it tussore) and drooping, garden-type of  hat, she was a different girl from the girl of the ship. She had been a  winter girl in white fur, then. Now she was a summer girl, and a  radiant vision, twice as pretty as before, especially in this Oriental  frame; still I was waiting to see myself fall in love with her, much in  the same way that Biddy was waiting. And there was that Oriental frame!  It belonged to my past, and perhaps Monny Gilder didn't belong even to  my future, so it was excusable if I thought of it more than of her.    It was hardly nine o'clock, but already the wonderful coloured cinema  show of Cairo daily life had begun to flash and flicker past the  terrace of Shepheard's, where East and West meet and mingle more  sensationally than anywhere in Egypt. Nobody save ourselves had dared  suggest breakfast; but travellers were pouring into the hotel, and  pouring out. Pretty women and plain women were sitting at the little  wicker tables to read letters, or discuss plans for the day with each  other or their dragomans. Officers in khaki came and talked to them  about golf and gymkhanas. Down on the pavement, close under the  balustrade, crowded young and old Egyptian men with dark faces and  wonderful eyes or no eyes at all, struggling to sell painted  post-cards, strings of blue-gray mummy beads; necklaces of cornelian and  great lumps of amber; fans, perfumes, sample sticks of smoking incense,  toy camels cleverly made of jute; fly whisks from the Sudan with  handles of beads and dangling shells; scarab rings and brooches; cheap,  gay jewellery, scarfs from Asiut, white, black, pale green and purple,  glittering like miniature cataracts of silver, as brown arms held them  up. Darting Arab urchins hawked tame ichneumons, or shouted newspapers  for sale--English, American, Greek, French, German, Italian, and  Turkish. Copper-tinted, classic-featured youths in white had golden  crowns of bananas round their turbans; withered patriarchs in blue  galabeahs offered oranges, or immense bunches of mixed flowers, fresh  and fragrant as the morning; or baskets of strawberries red and bright  as rubies. Dignified Arabs stalked by, bearing on nobly poised heads  pots of growing rose-bushes or arum lilies, or azaleas. Jet-black  giants, wound in rainbow-striped cottons, clanked brass saucers like  cymbals, advertising the sweet drinks in their glass jars, while memory  whispered in my ears the Arab name \"sherbetly.\" Across the street,  clear silver-gold sunshine of winter in Egypt shone on precious stones,  on carved ivories, silver anklets, Persian rugs, and embroideries,  brilliant as hummingbirds' wings, all displayed in the windows of shops  where dark eyes looked out eagerly for buyers. Everything was for sale,  for sale to the strangers! The whole clamouring city seemed to consist  of one vast, concentrated desire on the part of brown people to sell  things to fair people. They shouted and wheedled and besought on the  sidewalks; and the roadway between was a wide river of colour and life.  Motor cars with Arab chauffeurs carried rich Turks to business, or to  an audience of State. Now and then a face of ivory glimmered through a  gauzy veil and eyes of ink and diamonds shot starry glances from  passing carriage windows. Erect English women drove high dog-carts.  Gordon Highlanders swung along in the kilt, more at home in Cairo then  in Edinburgh, the droning of their pipes as Oriental as the drone of a  raeita, or the beat of tom-toms. A wedding party with a hidden bride in  a yellow chariot, met a funeral, and yashmaked faces peeped from  curtained windows, in one procession, to stare at the wailing, marching  men of the other, and to shrink back hastily from the sight of the  coffin. Tangled it would seem inextricably with streams of traffic,  surging both ways, moved the \"ships of the desert,\" loaded with  emerald-green bersim; long, lilting necks, and calm, mysterious eyes of  camels high above the cloaked heads of striding Bedouins, heads of  defiant Arab prisoners, chained and handcuffed to each other; heads of  blue-eyed water buffaloes, and heads of trim white, tasselled donkeys.    None of us talked very much, as we sat at the breakfast table: the  novelty and wonder of the scene made the actors forget their words: and  if we had been able to talk, we could not have appreciated each other's  rhapsodies, over the shoutings of men who wanted us to buy their wares,  and harangues of dragomans who wished, as Monny said, to \"drag\" us.  These latter, especially, were persistent, and Bedr the One Eyed,  having been forbidden to come till ten o'clock, was not on the spot to  give protection. Our method at first was to appear oblivious, but  presently in my wickedest Arabic, I would have ordered the troop away  if Monny had not interfered.    \"Don't!\" she said, \"they're part of the picture. Besides, they've more  right here than we have. It's their country, not ours. And they're so  interesting--most of them. That tall man over there, for instance, with  the green turban. He's the only one who hasn't opened his mouth. Just  to show him that virtue's its own reward, I'm going to engage him. Will  you call him to us, please, Lord Ernest?\"    Sitting as I sat, I could not see the person indicated. \"What do you  want him for, Miss Gilder?\" I obeyed temptation, and asked.    \"Why, to be a dragoman, of course,\" she explained. \"That's what he's  for. I told you, I'd have a picturesque one for ornament. This  creature's a perfect specimen.\"    I stood up reluctantly, and looked down over the balustrade. \"A man  with a green turban?\" I repeated. \"But that means he's a Hadji, who's  been to Mecca and back. I never heard of a dragoman--\"    I stopped short in my argument. My eyes had found the man with the  green turban.    He stood at some distance behind the pavement-merchants and  self-advertising dragomans who pressed against the railing. In his long  galabeah of Sudan silk, ashes of roses in colour, he was tall and  straight as a palm, gravely dignified with his folded arms and the  haughty remoteness of his expression. Dark and silent, half-disdainful,  half-amused, he was like a prince compared with his humbler brethren;  but there was another resemblance more relevant and intimate which cut  my sentence short.    \"By Jove,\" I thought, \"how like he is to Anthony Fenton!\"    He was looking, not at me, but at Miss Gilder, quite respectfully yet  hypnotically, as if by way of an experiment he had been willing her to  find and single out the one motionless figure, the one person whose  tongue had not called attention to himself.    Yes, I thought again, he was an Arab copy of Anthony, but more as  Anthony had been years ago before his moustache grew, than as Anthony  had become in late years. Still, there were the aquiline features, the  long, rather sad eyes shaded with thick, straight lashes, the eyebrows  raised"]]]
