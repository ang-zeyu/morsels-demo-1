An estimated 13 million    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its    summer and winter resorts. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status,    also contributes significantly to the economy. Agricultural production is    limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The    principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly    of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Although it is a member of the EC    customs union, it is unclear what effect the European Single Market will    have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free status.

A live coal placed  next a dead one will either kindle that or be quenched by it. Such being  the risk, it is well to be cautious in admitting intimacies of this  sort, remembering that one cannot rub shoulders with a soot-stained man  without sharing the soot oneself. What will you do, supposing the talk  turns on gladiators, or horses, or prize-fighters, or (what is worse) on  persons, condemning this and that, approving the other? Or suppose a man  sneers and jeers or shows a malignant temper? Has any among us the skill  of the lute-player, who knows at the first touch which strings are out  of tune and sets the instrument right: has any of you such power as  Socrates had, in all his intercourse with men, of winning them over  to his own convictions? Nay, but you must needs be swayed hither and  thither by the uninstructed. How comes it then that they prove so  much stronger than you? Because they speak from the fulness of the  heart--their low, corrupt views are their real convictions: whereas your  fine sentiments are but from the lips, outwards; that is why they are  so nerveless and dead. It turns one's stomach to listen to your  exhortations, and hear of your miserable Virtue, that you prate of  up and down. Thus it is that the Vulgar prove too strong for you.  Everywhere strength, everywhere victory waits your conviction!          C    In general, any methods of discipline applied to the body which tend  to modify its desires or repulsions, are good--for ascetic ends. But if  done for display, they betray at once a man who keeps an eye on outward  show; who has an ulterior purpose, and is looking for spectators to  shout, \"Oh what a great man!\" This is why Apollonius so well said: \"If  you are bent upon a little private discipline, wait till you are choking  with heat some day--then take a mouthful of cold water, and spit it out  again, and tell no man!\"          CI    Study how to give as one that is sick: that thou mayest hereafter give  as one that is whole. Fast; drink water only; abstain altogether from  desire, that thou mayest hereafter conform thy desire to Reason.          CII    Thou wouldst do good unto men? then show them by thine own example  what kind of men philosophy can make, and cease from foolish trifling.  Eating, do good to them that eat with thee; drinking, to them that drink  with thee; yield unto all, give way, and bear with them. Thus shalt thou  do them good: but vent not upon them thine own evil humour!          CIII    Even as bad actors cannot sing alone, but only in chorus: so some cannot  walk alone.    Man, if thou art aught, strive to walk alone and hold converse with  thyself, instead of skulking in the chorus! at length think; look around  thee; bestir thyself, that thou mayest know who thou art!          CIV    You would fain be victor at the Olympic games, you say. Yes, but weigh  the conditions, weigh the consequences; then and then only, lay to your  hand--if it be for your profit. You must live by rule, submit to diet,  abstain from dainty meats, exercise your body perforce at stated hours,  in heat or in cold; drink no cold water, nor, it may be, wine. In a  word, you must surrender yourself wholly to your trainer, as though to a  physician.    Then in the hour of contest, you will have to delve the ground, it may  chance dislocate an arm, sprain an ankle, gulp down abundance of yellow  sand, be scourge with the whip--and with all this sometimes lose the  victory. Count the cost--and then, if your desire still holds, try the  wrestler's life. Else let me tell you that you will be behaving like a  pack of children playing now at wrestlers, now at gladiators; presently  falling to trumpeting and anon to stage-playing, when the fancy takes  them for what they have seen. And you are even the same: wrestler,  gladiator, philosopher, orator all by turns and none of them with your  whole soul. Like an ape, you mimic what you see, to one thing constant  never; the thing that is familiar charms no more. This is because you  never undertook aught with due consideration, nor after strictly testing  and viewing it from every side; no, your choice was thoughtless; the  glow of your desire had waxed cold . . . .    Friend, bethink you first what it is you would do, and then what your  own nature is able to bear. Would you be a wrestler, consider your  shoulders, your thighs, your loins--not all men are formed to the same  end. Think you to be a philosopher while acting as you do? think you go  on thus eating, thus drinking, giving way in like manner to wrath and  to displeasure? Nay, you must watch, you must labour; overcome certain  desires; quit your familiar friends, submit to be despised by your  slave, to be held in derision by them that meet you, to take the lower  place in all things, in office, in positions of authority, in courts of  law.    Weigh these things fully, and then, if you will, lay to your hand; if  as the price of these things you would gain Freedom, Tranquillity, and  passionless Serenity.          CV    He that hath no musical instruction is a child in Music; he that hath no  letters is a child in Learning; he that is untaught is a child in Life.          CVI    Can any profit be derived from these men? Aye, from all.    \"What, even from a reviler?\"    Why, tell me what profit a wrestler gains from him who exercises  him beforehand? The very greatest: he trains me in the practice of  endurance, of controlling my temper, of gentle ways. You deny it. What,  the man who lays hold of my neck, and disciplines loins and shoulders,  does me good, . . . while he that trains me to keep my temper does me  none? This is what it means, not knowing how to gain advantage from men!  Is my neighbour bad? Bad to himself, but good to me: he brings my good  temper, my gentleness into play. Is my father bad? Bad to himself, but  good to me. This is the rod of Hermes; touch what you will with it,  they say, and it becomes gold. Nay, but bring what you will and I will  transmute it into Good. Bring sickness, bring death, bring poverty and  reproach, bring trial for life--all these things through the rod of  Hermes shall be turned to profit.          CVII    Till then these sound opinions have taken firm root in you, and you  have gained a measure of strength for your security, I counsel you to be  cautious in associating with the uninstructed. Else whatever impressions  you receive upon the tablets of your mind in the School will day by day  melt and disappear, like wax in the sun. Withdraw then somewhere far  from the sun, while you have these waxen sentiments.          CVIII    We must approach this matter in a different way; it is great and  mystical: it is no common thing; nor given to every man. Wisdom alone,  it may be, will not suffice for the care of youth: a man needs also  a certain measure of readiness--an aptitude for the office; aye, and  certain bodily qualities; and above all, to be counselled of God Himself  to undertake this post; even as He counselled Socrates to fill the post  of one who confutes error, assigning to Diogenes the royal office of  high reproof, and to Zeno that of positive instruction. Whereas you  would fain set up for a physician provided with nothing but drugs! Where  and how they should be applied you neither know nor care.          CIX    If what charms you is nothing but abstract principles, sit down and turn  them over quietly in your mind: but never dub yourself a Philosopher,  nor suffer others to call you so. Say rather: He is in error; for my  desires, my impulses are unaltered. I give in my adhesion to what I did  before; nor has my mode of dealing with the things of sense undergone  any change.          CX    When a friend inclined to Cynic views asked Epictetus, what sort of  person a true Cynic should be, requesting a general sketch of the  system, he answered:--\"We will consider that at leisure. At present  I content myself with saying this much: If a man put his hand to so  weighty a matter without God, the wrath of God abides upon him. That  which he covets will but bring upon him public shame. Not even on  finding himself in a well-ordered house does a man step forward and say  to himself, I must be master here! Else the lord of that house takes  notice of it, and, seeing him insolently giving orders, drags him forth  and chastises him. So it is also in this great City, the World. Here  also is there a Lord of the House, who orders all thing:--         \"Thou are the Sun! in thine orbit thou hast       power to make the year and the seasons;       to bid the fruits of the earth to grow       and increase, the winds arise and fall;       thou canst in due measure cherish with       thy warmth the frames of men; go make       thy circuit, and thus minister unto all       from the greatest to the least! . . .\"         \"Thou canst lead a host against Troy; be Agamemnon!\"         \"Thou canst meet Hector in single combat; be Achilles!\"    \"But had Thersites stepped forward and claimed the chief command, he  had been met with a refusal, or obtained it only to his own shame and  confusion of face, before a cloud of witnesses.\"          CXI    Others may fence themselves with walls and houses, when they do such  deeds as these, and wrap themselves in darkness--aye, they have many  a device to hide themselves. Another may shut his door and station one  before his chamber to say, if any comes, He has gone forth! he is not at  leisure! But the true Cynic will have none of these things; instead of  them, he must wrap himself in Modesty: else he will but bring himself  to shame, naked and under the open sky. That is his house; that is his  door; that is the slave that guards his chamber; that is his darkness!          CXII    Death? let it come when it will, whether it smite but a part of the  whole: Fly, you tell me--fly! But"]]]
