   20:022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the             afflicted in the gate:    20:022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of             those that spoiled them.    20:022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man             thou shalt not go:    20:022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.    20:022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are             sureties for debts.    20:022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed             from under thee?    20:022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.    20:022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand             before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.    20:023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently             what is before thee:    20:023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to             appetite.    20:023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.    20:023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.    20:023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches             certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle             toward heaven.    20:023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither             desire thou his dainty meats:    20:023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,             saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.    20:023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose             thy sweet words.    20:023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the             wisdom of thy words.    20:023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of             the fatherless:    20:023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with             thee.    20:023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the             words of knowledge.    20:023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest             him with the rod, he shall not die.    20:023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul             from hell.    20:023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even             mine.    20:023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.    20:023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of             the LORD all the day long.    20:023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be             cut off.    20:023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the             way.    20:023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:    20:023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and             drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.    20:023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy             mother when she is old.    20:023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,             and understanding.    20:023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that             begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.    20:023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare             thee shall rejoice.    20:023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my             ways.    20:023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow             pit.    20:023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the             transgressors among men.    20:023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath             babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of             eyes?    20:023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed             wine.    20:023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his             colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.    20:023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an             adder.    20:023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall             utter perverse things.    20:023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the             sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.    20:023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;             they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I             will seek it yet again.    20:024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be             with them.    20:024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of             mischief.    20:024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is             established:    20:024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all             precious and pleasant riches.    20:024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth             strength.    20:024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude             of counsellors there is safety.    20:024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the             gate.    20:024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous             person.    20:024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an             abomination to men.    20:024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.    20:024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and             those that are ready to be slain;    20:024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that             pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,             doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man             according to his works?    20:024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,             which is sweet to thy taste:    20:024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou             hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy             expectation shall not be cut off.    20:024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the             righteous; spoil not his resting place:    20:024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but             the wicked shall fall into mischief.    20:024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart             be glad when he stumbleth:    20:024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away             his wrath from him.    20:024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious             at the wicked:    20:024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of             the wicked shall be put out.    20:024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with             them that are given to change:    20:024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the             ruin of them both?    20:024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have             respect of persons in judgment.    20:024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall             the people curse, nations shall abhor him:    20:024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good             blessing shall come upon them.    20:024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.    20:024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the             field; and afterwards build thine house.    20:024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and             deceive not with thy lips.    20:024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will             render to the man according to his work.    20:024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of             the man void of understanding;    20:024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had             covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was             broken down.    20:024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and             received instruction.    20:024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the             hands to sleep:    20:024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want             as an armed man.    20:025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#8)"],[1,"to Gianetta,    \"I can't stand this any longer; those two poor Monarchs haven't    got any one to mend their stockings or sew on their buttons or    patch their clothesat least, I hope they haven'tlet us all    pack up a change and go and see how they're getting on.\"  And she    said, \"Done,\" and they all said, \"Done\"; and we asked old Giacopo    to lend us his boat, and he said, \"Done\"; and we've crossed the    sea, and, thank goodness, that's done; and here we are,    andandI've done!         GIA.  And nowwhich of you is King?         TESS.  And which of us is Queen?         GIU.  That we shan't know until Nurse turns up.  But never    mind thatthe question is, how shall we celebrate the    commencement of our honeymoon?  Gentlemen, will you allow us to    offer you a magnificent banquet?         ALL.  We will!         GIU.  Thanks very much; and, ladies, what do you say to a    dance?         TESS.  A banquet and a dance!  O, it's too much happiness!                              CHORUS and DANCE.                Dance a cachucha, fandango, bolero,              Xeres we'll drinkManzanilla, Montero              Wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances              The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!                   To the pretty pitter-pitter-patter,                   And the clitter-clitter-clitter-clatter                        Clitterclitterclatter,                        Pitterpitterpatter,                   Patter, patter, patter, patter, we'll dance.              Old Xeres we'll drinkManzanilla, Montero;              For wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances              The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!      (Cachucha.)      (The dance is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Don    Alhambra, who looks on with astonishment.  Marco and Giuseppe    appear embarrassed.  The others run off, except Drummer Boy, who    is driven off by Don Alhambra.)           DON AL.  Good evening.  Fancy ball?         GIU.  No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's    all.  Sorry you're late.         DON AL.  But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!         MAR.  Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.         DON AL.  And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!         GIU.  Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.         DON AL.  But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place    for these gentry?         GIU.  Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall.    It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets    obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.         MAR.  We really must have some place that we can call our    own.         DON AL. (puzzled).  I'm afraid I'm not quite equal to the    intellectual pressure of the conversation.         GIU.  You see, the Monarchy has been re-modelled on    Republican principles.         DON AL.  What!         GIU.  All departments rank equally, and everybody is at the    head of his department.         DON AL.  I see.         MAR.  I'm afraid you're annoyed.         DON AL.  No.  I won't say that.  It's not quite what I    expected.         GIU.  I'm awfully sorry.         MAR.  So am I.         GIU.  By the by, can I offer you anything after your voyage?    A plate of macaroni and a rusk?         DON AL. (preoccupied).  No, nonothingnothing.         GIU.  Obliged to be careful?         DON AL.  Yesgout.  You see, in every Court there are    distinctions that must be observed.         GIU. (puzzled).  There are, are there?         DON AL.  Why, of course.  For instance, you wouldn't have a    Lord High Chancellor play leapfrog with his own cook.         MAR.  Why not?         DON AL.  Why not!  Because a Lord High Chancellor is a    personage of great dignity, who should never, under any    circumstances, place himself in the position of being told to    tuck in his tuppenny, except by noblemen of his own rank.  A Lord    High Archbishop, for instance, might tell a Lord High Chancellor    to tuck in his tuppenny, but certainly not a cook, gentlemen,    certainly not a cook.         GIU.  Not even a Lord High Cook?         DON AL.  My good friend, that is a rank that is not    recognized at the Lord Chamberlain's office.  No, no, it won't    do.  I'll give you an instance in which the experiment was tried.                SONGDON ALHAMBRA, with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.      DON AL.   There lived a King, as I've been told,              In the wonder-working days of old,              When hearts were twice as good as gold,                   And twenty times as mellow.              Good-temper triumphed in his face,              And in his heart he found a place              For all the erring human race                   And every wretched fellow.              When he had Rhenish wine to drink              It made him very sad to think              That some, at junket or at jink,                   Must be content with toddy.      MAR. and GIU.  With toddy, must be content with toddy.      DON AL.   He wished all men as rich as he              (And he was rich as rich could be),              So to the top of every tree                   Promoted everybody.      MAR. and GIU.  Now, that's the kind of King for me.              He wished all men as rich as he,              So to the top of every tree                   Promoted everybody!      DON AL.   Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats,              And Bishops in their shovel hats              Were plentiful as tabby cats                   In point of fact, too many.              Ambassadors cropped up like hay,              Prime Ministers and such as they              Grew like asparagus in May,                   And Dukes were three a penny.              On every side Field-Marshals gleamed,              Small beer were Lords-Lieutenant deemed,              With Admirals the ocean teemed                   All round his wide dominions.      MAR. and GIU.  With Admirals all round his wide dominions.      DON AL.   And Party Leaders you might meet              In twos and threes in every street              Maintaining, with no little heat,                   Their various opinions.      MAR. and GIU.  Now that's a sight you couldn't beat              Two Party Leaders in each street              Maintaining, with no little heat,                   Their various opinions.      DON AL.   That King, although no one denies              His heart was of abnormal size,              Yet he'd have acted otherwise                   If he had been acuter.              The end is easily foretold,              When every blessed thing you hold              Is made of silver, or of gold,                   You long for simple pewter.              When you have nothing else to wear              But cloth of gold and satins rare,              For cloth of gold you cease to care                   Up goes the price of shoddy.      MAR. and GIU.  Of shoddy, up goes the price of shoddy.      DON AL.   In short, whoever you may be,              To this conclusion you'll agree,              When every one is somebodee,                   Then no one's anybody!      MAR. and GIU.  Now that's as plain as plain can be,              To this conclusion we agree      ALL.      When every one is somebodee,                   Then no one's anybody!      (Gianetta and Tessa enter unobserved.  The two girls, impelled by    curiosity, remain listening at the back of the stage.)           DON AL.  And now I have some important news to communicate.    His Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Her Grace the Duchess, and    their beautiful daughter CasildaI say their beautiful daughter    Casilda         GIU.  We heard you.         DON AL.  Have arrived at Barataria, and may be here at any    moment.         MAR.  The Duke and Duchess are nothing to us.         DON AL.  But the daughterthe beautiful daughter!  Aha!    Oh, you're a lucky dog, one of you!         GIU.  I think you're a very incomprehensible old gentleman.         DON AL.  Not a bitI'll explain.  Many years ago when you    (whichever you are) were a baby, you (whichever you are) were    married to a little girl who has grown up to be the most    beautiful young lady in Spain.  That beautiful young lady will be    here to claim you (whichever you are) in half an hour, and I    congratulate that one (whichever it is) with all my heart.         MAR.  Married when a baby!         GIU.  But we were married three months ago!         DON AL.  One of youonly one.  The other (whichever it is)    is an unintentional bigamist.         GIA. and TESS. (coming forward).  Well, upon my word!         DON AL.  Eh?  Who are these young people?         TESS.  Who are we?  Why, their wives, of course.  We've just    arrived.         DON AL.  Their wives!  Oh dear, this is very unfortunate!    Oh dear, this complicates matters!  Dear, dear, what will Her    Majesty say?         GIA.  And do you mean to say that one of these Monarchs was    already married?         TESS.  And that neither of us will be a Queen?         DON AL.  That is the idea I intended to convey.  (Tessa and    Gianetta begin to cry.)         GIU. (to Tessa).  Tessa, my dear, dear child         TESS.  Get away! perhaps it's you!         MAR. (to Gia.).  My poor, poor little woman!         GIA.  Don't!  Who knows whose husband you are?         TESS.  And pray, why didn't you tell us all about it before    they left Venice?         DON AL.  Because, if I had, no earthly temptation would have    induced these gentlemen to leave two such extremely fascinating    and utterly irresistible little ladies!         TESS.
