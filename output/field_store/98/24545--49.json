Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#8)"],[1,"women stood quietly on the deck or paced slowly up and down  waiting for orders from the officers. Now, before we consider any  further the events that followed, the state of mind of passengers at  this juncture, and the motives which led each one to act as he or she  did in the circumstances, it is important to keep in thought the  amount of information at our disposal. Men and women act according to  judgment based on knowledge of the conditions around them, and the  best way to understand some apparently inconceivable things that  happened is for any one to imagine himself or herself standing on deck  that night. It seems a mystery to some people that women refused to  leave the ship, that some persons retired to their cabins, and so on;  but it is a matter of judgment, after all.    So that if the reader will come and stand with the crowd on deck, he  must first rid himself entirely of the knowledge that the Titanic has  sunk--an important necessity, for he cannot see conditions as they  existed there through the mental haze arising from knowledge of the  greatest maritime tragedy the world has known: he must get rid of any  foreknowledge of disaster to appreciate why people acted as they did.  Secondly, he had better get rid of any picture in thought painted  either by his own imagination or by some artist, whether pictorial or  verbal, \"from information supplied.\" Some are most inaccurate (these,  mostly word-pictures), and where they err, they err on the highly  dramatic side. They need not have done so: the whole conditions were  dramatic enough in all their bare simplicity, without the addition of  any high colouring.    Having made these mental erasures, he will find himself as one of the  crowd faced with the following conditions: a perfectly still  atmosphere; a brilliantly beautiful starlight night, but no moon, and  so with little light that was of any use; a ship that had come quietly  to rest without any indication of disaster--no iceberg visible, no  hole in the ship's side through which water was pouring in, nothing  broken or out of place, no sound of alarm, no panic, no movement of  any one except at a walking pace; the absence of any knowledge of the  nature of the accident, of the extent of damage, of the danger of the  ship sinking in a few hours, of the numbers of boats, rafts, and other  lifesaving appliances available, their capacity, what other ships were  near or coming to help--in fact, an almost complete absence of any  positive knowledge on any point. I think this was the result of  deliberate judgment on the part of the officers, and perhaps, it was  the best thing that could be done. In particular, he must remember  that the ship was a sixth of a mile long, with passengers on three  decks open to the sea, and port and starboard sides to each deck: he  will then get some idea of the difficulty presented to the officers of  keeping control over such a large area, and the impossibility of any  one knowing what was happening except in his own immediate vicinity.  Perhaps the whole thing can be summed up best by saying that, after we  had embarked in the lifeboats and rowed away from the Titanic, it  would not have surprised us to hear that all passengers would be  saved: the cries of drowning people after the Titanic gave the final  plunge were a thunderbolt to us. I am aware that the experiences of  many of those saved differed in some respects from the above: some had  knowledge of certain things, some were experienced travellers and  sailors, and therefore deduced more rapidly what was likely to happen;  but I think the above gives a fairly accurate representation of the  state of mind of most of those on deck that night.    All this time people were pouring up from the stairs and adding to the  crowd: I remember at that moment thinking it would be well to return  to my cabin and rescue some money and warmer clothing if we were to  embark in boats, but looking through the vestibule windows and seeing  people still coming upstairs, I decided it would only cause confusion  passing them on the stairs, and so remained on deck.    I was now on the starboard side of the top boat deck; the time about  12.20. We watched the crew at work on the lifeboats, numbers 9, 11,  13, 15, some inside arranging the oars, some coiling ropes on the  deck,--the ropes which ran through the pulleys to lower to the  sea,--others with cranks fitted to the rocking arms of the davits. As  we watched, the cranks were turned, the davits swung outwards until  the boats hung clear of the edge of the deck. Just then an officer  came along from the first-class deck and shouted above the noise of  escaping steam, \"All women and children get down to deck below and all  men stand back from the boats.\" He had apparently been off duty when  the ship struck, and was lightly dressed, with a white muffler twisted  hastily round his neck. The men fell back and the women retired below  to get into the boats from the next deck. Two women refused at first  to leave their husbands, but partly by persuasion and partly by force  they were separated from them and sent down to the next deck. I think  that by this time the work on the lifeboats and the separation of men  and women impressed on us slowly the presence of imminent danger, but  it made no difference in the attitude of the crowd: they were just as  prepared to obey orders and to do what came next as when they first  came on deck. I do not mean that they actually reasoned it out: they  were the average Teutonic crowd, with an inborn respect for law and  order and for traditions bequeathed to them by generations of  ancestors: the reasons that made them act as they did were impersonal,  instinctive, hereditary.    But if there were any one who had not by now realized that the ship  was in danger, all doubt on this point was to be set at rest in a  dramatic manner. Suddenly a rush of light from the forward deck, a  hissing roar that made us all turn from watching the boats, and a  rocket leapt upwards to where the stars blinked and twinkled above us.  Up it went, higher and higher, with a sea of faces upturned to watch  it, and then an explosion that seemed to split the silent night in  two, and a shower of stars sank slowly down and went out one by one.  And with a gasping sigh one word escaped the lips of the crowd:  \"Rockets!\" Anybody knows what rockets at sea mean. And presently  another, and then a third. It is no use denying the dramatic intensity  of the scene: separate it if you can from all the terrible events that  followed, and picture the calmness of the night, the sudden light on  the decks crowded with people in different stages of dress and  undress, the background of huge funnels and tapering masts revealed by  the soaring rocket, whose flash illumined at the same time the faces  and minds of the obedient crowd, the one with mere physical light, the  other with a sudden revelation of what its message was. Every one knew  without being told that we were calling for help from any one who was  near enough to see.    The crew were now in the boats, the sailors standing by the pulley  ropes let them slip through the cleats in jerks, and down the boats  went till level with B deck; women and children climbed over the rail  into the boats and filled them; when full, they were lowered one by  one, beginning with number 9, the first on the second-class deck, and  working backwards towards 15. All this we could see by peering over  the edge of the boat-deck, which was now quite open to the sea, the  four boats which formed a natural barrier being lowered from the deck  and leaving it exposed.    About this time, while walking the deck, I saw two ladies come over  from the port side and walk towards the rail separating the  second-class from the first-class deck. There stood an officer barring  the way. \"May we pass to the boats?\" they said. \"No, madam,\" he  replied politely, \"your boats are down on your own deck,\" pointing to  where they swung below. The ladies turned and went towards the  stairway, and no doubt were able to enter one of the boats: they had  ample time. I mention this to show that there was, at any rate, some  arrangement--whether official or not--for separating the classes in  embarking in boats; how far it was carried out, I do not know, but if  the second-class ladies were not expected to enter a boat from the  first-class deck, while steerage passengers were allowed access to the  second-class deck, it would seem to press rather hardly on the  second-class men, and this is rather supported by the low percentage  saved.    Almost immediately after this incident, a report went round among men  on the top deck--the starboard side--that men were to be taken off on  the port side; how it originated, I am quite unable to say, but can  only suppose that as the port boats, numbers 10 to 16, were not  lowered from the top deck quite so soon as the starboard boats (they  could still be seen on deck), it might be assumed that women were  being taken off on one side and men on the other; but in whatever way  the report started, it was acted on at once by almost all the men, who  crowded across to the port side and watched the preparation for  lowering the boats, leaving the starboard side almost deserted. Two or  three men remained, However: not for any reason that we were  consciously aware of; I can personally think of no decision arising  from reasoned thought that induced me to remain rather than to cross  over. But while there was no process of conscious reason at work, I am  convinced that what was my salvation was a recognition of the  necessity of being quiet and waiting in patience for some opportunity  of safety to present itself.    Soon after the men had left the starboard side, I saw a bandsman--the  'cellist--come round the vestibule corner from the staircase entrance  and run down the now deserted starboard deck, his 'cello trailing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#8)"],[1," dried near the fire.    Fourteen eggs.    One pound of powdered loaf-sugar.    Twelve drops of essence of lemon.    Blanch the almonds, by scalding them in hot water. Put them in a  bowl of cold water, and wipe them dry, when you take them out.  Pound them, one at a time, in a mortar, till they are perfectly  smooth. Mix the sweet and bitter almonds together. Prepare them,  if possible the day before the cake is made. [Footnote: While  pounding the almonds, pour in occasionally a little rose-water. It  makes them much lighter.]    Put the whites and yolks of the eggs, into separate pans. Beat the  whites till they stand alone, and then the yolks till they are  very thick.    Put the sugar, gradually, to the yolks, beating it in very hard.  Add, by degrees, the almonds, still beating very hard. Then put in  the essence of lemon. Next, beat in, gradually, the whites of the  eggs, continuing to beat for some time after they are all in.  Lastly, stir in the flour, as slowly and lightly, as possible.    Butter a large tin mould or pan. Put the cake in and bake it in a  very quick oven, an hour or more according to its thickness.    The oven must on no account be hotter at the top, than at the  bottom.    When done, set it on a sieve to cool.    Ice it, and ornament it with nonpareils.    These almond cakes are generally baked in a turban-shaped mould,  and the nonpareils put on, in spots or sprigs.    A pound of almonds in the shells (if the shells are soft and  thin,) will generally yield half a pound when shelled. Hard,  thick-shelled almonds, seldom yield much more than a quarter of a  pound, and should therefore never be bought for cakes or puddings.    Bitter almonds and peach-kernels can always be purchased with the  shells off.    Families should always save their peach-kernels, as they can be  used in cakes, puddings and custards.      MACCAROONS.      Half a pound of shelled sweet almonds.    A quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds.    The whites of three eggs.    Twenty-four large tea-spoonfuls of powdered loaf-sugar.    A tea-spoonful of rose-water.    A large tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.    Blanch and pound your almonds, beat them very smooth, and mix the  sweet and bitter together; do them, if you can, the day before you  make the maccaroons. Pound and sift your spice. Beat the whites of  three eggs till they stand alone; add to them, very gradually, the  powdered sugar, a spoonful at a time, beat it in very hard, and  put in, by degrees, the rose-water and spice. Then stir in,  gradually, the almonds. The mixture must be like a soft dough; if  too thick, it will be heavy; if too thin, it will run out of  shape. If you find your almonds not sufficient, prepare a few  more, and stir them in. When it is all well mixed and stirred, put  some flour in the palm of your hand, and taking up a lump of the  mixture with a knife, roll it on your hand with the flour into a  small round ball; have ready an iron or tin pan, buttered, and lay  the maccaroons in it, as you make them up. Place them about two  inches apart, in case of their spreading. Bake them about eight or  ten minutes in a moderate oven; they should be baked of a pale  brown colour. If too much baked, they will lose their flavour; if  too little, they will be heavy. They should rise high in the  middle, and crack on the surface. You may, if you choose, put a  larger proportion of spice. [Footnote: Cocoa-nut cakes may be made  in a similar manner, substituting for the pounded almonds half a  pound of finely-grated cocoa-nut. They mast be made into small  round balls with a little flour laid on the palm of the hand, and  baked a few minutes. They are very fine.]      APEES.      A pound of flour, sifted.    Half a pound of butter.    Half a glass of wine, and a table-spoon of rose-water mixed.    Half a pound of powdered white sugar.    A nutmeg, grated.    A tea-spoonful of beaten cinnamon and mace.    Three table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.    Sift the flour into a broad pan, and cut up the butter in it. Add  the carraways, sugar, and spice, and pour in the liquor by  degrees, mixing it well with a knife; add enough of cold water to  make it a stiff dough. Spread some flour on your pasteboard, take  out the dough, and knead it very well with your hands. Cut it into  small pieces, and knead each separately, then put them all  together, and knead the whole in one lump. Roll it out in a sheet  about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it out in round cakes, with  the edge of a tumbler, or a tin of that size. Butter an iron pan,  and lay the cakes in it, not too close together. Bake them a few  minutes in a moderate oven, till they are very slightly coloured,  but not brown. If too much baked, they will entirely lose their  flavour. Do not roll them out too thin.      JUMBLES.      Three eggs.    Half a pound of flour, sifted.    Half a pound of butter.    Half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    A nutmeg grated.    A tea-spoonful of mixed mace and cinnamon.    Stir the sugar and butter to a cream. Beat the eggs very light.  Throw them, all at once, into the pan of flour. Put in, at once,  the butter and sugar, and then add the spice and rose-water. If  you have no rose-water, substitute six or seven drops of strong  essence of lemon, or more if the essence is weak. Stir the whole  very hard, with a knife.    Spread some flour on your paste-board, and flour your hands well.  Take up with your knife, a portion of the dough, and lay it on the  board. Roll it lightly with your hands, into long shin rolls,  which must be cut into equal lengths, curled up into rings, and  laid gently into an iron or tin pan, buttered, not too close to  each other, as they spread in baking. Bake them in a quick oven  about five minutes, and grate loaf-sugar over them when cool.      KISSES.      One pound of the best loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.    The whites of four eggs.    Twelve drops of essence of lemon.    A tea-cup of currant jelly.    Beat the whites of four eggs till they stand alone. Then heat in,  gradually, the sugar, a tea-spoonful at a time. Add the essence of  lemon, and beat the whole very hard.    Lay a wet sheet of paper on the bottom of a square tin pan. Drop  on it, at equal distances, a small tea-spoonful of stiff currant  jelly. [Footnote: It is better to put a little of the beaten white  of egg and sugar at first under the currant jelly.] With a large  spoon, pile some of the beaten white of egg and sugar, on each  lump of jelly, so as to cover it entirely. Drop on the mixture as  evenly as possible, so as to make the kisses of a round smooth  shape.    Set them in a cool open, and as soon as they are coloured, they  are done. Then take them out and place them two bottoms together.  Lay them lightly on sieve, and dry them in a cool oven, till the  two bottoms stick fast together, so as to form one ball or oval.      SPANISH BUNS.      Four eggs.    Three quarters of a pound of flour, sifted.    Half a pound of powdered white sugar.    Two wine-glasses and a half of rich milk.    Six ounces of fresh butter.    A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    A grated nutmeg.    A large tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon.    Sift half a pound of flour into a broad pan, and sift a quarter of  a pound, separately, into a deep plate, and set it aside. Put the  milk into a soup-plate, cut up the butter, and set it on the stove  or near the fire to warm, but do not let it get too hot. When the  butter is very soft, stir it all through the milk with a knife,  and set it away to cool. Beat the eggs very light, and mix the  milk and butter with them, all at once; then pour all into the pan  of flour. Put in the spice, and the rose-water, or if you prefer  it, eight drops of essence of lemon. Add the yeast, of which an  increased quantity will be necessary, if it is not very strong and  fresh. Stir the whole very hard, with a knife. Add the sugar  gradually. If the sugar is not stirred in slowly, a little at a  time, the buns will be heavy. Then, by degrees, sprinkle in the  renaming quarter of a pound of flour. Stir all well together;  butter a square iron pan, and put in the mixture. Cover it with a  cloth, and set it near the fire to rise. It will probably not be  light in less than five hours. When it is risen very high, and is  covered with bubbles, bake it in a moderate oven, about a quarter  of an hour or more in proportion to its thickness.    When it is quite cool, cut it in squares, and grate loaf-sugar  over them. This quantity will make twelve or fifteen buns.    They are best the day they are baked.    You may, if you choose, bake them separately, in small square  tins, adding to the baiter half a pound of currants or chopped  raisins, well floured, and stirred in at the last.    In making buns, stir the yeast well before you put it in, having  first poured off the beer or thin part from the top. If your yeast  is not good, do not attempt to make buns with it, as they will  never be light.    Buns may be made in a plainer way, with the following ingredients,  mixed in the above manner.        Half a pound of flour, sifted into a pan.    A quarter of a pound of flour, sifted in a plate, and set aside to      sprinkle in at the last.    Three eggs, well beaten.    A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.    Three wine-glasses of milk.    A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.    A quarter of a pound of butter, cut up, and warmed in the milk.      RUSK.      A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.    A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.    One pound of flour sifted.    One egg.    Three wine-glasses of milk.    A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.    Sift your flour into a pan. Cut up the butter in the milk, and  warm them a little, so as to soften the butter, "]]]
