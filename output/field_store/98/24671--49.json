He thought he was approaching a yard  where there was a fire, and the flames proved to be from pine cones  burning in the yard of Helen Sheppard. He remembered then that she was  entertaining some of the young people.    The figure he was pursuing did not pass the glare. Jonathan made  certain it disappeared before reaching the light, and he knew his  eyesight too well not to trust to it absolutely. Advancing nearer the  yard, he heard the murmur of voices in gay conversation, and soon saw  figures moving about under the trees.    No doubt was in his mind but that the man who gave the signal to warn  the Indians, was one of Helen Sheppard's guests.    Jonathan had walked across the street then down the path, before he  saw the colonel coming from the opposite direction. Halting under a  maple he waited for his brother to approach.    \"I didn't meet any one. Did you lose him?\" whispered Colonel Zane  breathlessly.    \"No; he's in there.\"    \"That's Sheppard's place. Do you mean he's hiding there?\"    \"No!\"    Colonel Zane swore, as was his habit when exasperated. Kind and  generous man that he was, it went hard with him to believe in the  guilt of any of the young men he had trusted. But Jonathan had said  there was a traitor among them, and Colonel Zane did not question this  assertion. He knew the borderman. During years full of strife, and  war, and blood had he lived beside this silent man who said little,  but that little was the truth. Therefore Colonel Zane gave way  to anger.    \"Well, I'm not so damned surprised! What's to be done?\"    \"Find out what men are there?\"    \"That's easy. I'll go to see George and soon have the truth.\"    \"Won't do,\" said the borderman decisively. \"Go back to the barn, an'  look after the hosses.\"    When Colonel Zane had obeyed Jonathan dropped to his hands and knees,  and swiftly, with the agile movements of an Indian, gained a corner of  the Sheppard yard. He crouched in the shade of a big plum tree. Then,  at a favorable opportunity, vaulted the fence and disappeared under a  clump of lilac bushes.    The evening wore away no more tediously to the borderman, than to  those young frontiersmen who were whispering tender or playful words  to their partners. Time and patience were the same to Jonathan Zane.  He lay hidden under the fragrant lilacs, his eyes, accustomed to the  dark from long practice, losing no movement of the guests. Finally it  became evident that the party was at an end. One couple took the  initiative, and said good night to their hostess.    \"Tom Bennet, I hope it's not you,\" whispered the borderman to himself,  as he recognized the young fellow.    A general movement followed, until the merry party were assembled  about Helen near the front gate.    \"Jim Morrison, I'll bet it's not you,\" was Jonathan's comment. \"That  soldier Williams is doubtful; Hart an' Johnson being strangers, are  unknown quantities around here, an' then comes Brandt.\"    All departed except Brandt, who remained talking to Helen in low,  earnest tones. Jonathan lay very quietly, trying to decide what should  be his next move in the unraveling of the mystery. He paid little  attention to the young couple, but could not help overhearing their  conversation.    \"Indeed, Mr. Brandt, you frontiersmen are not backward,\" Helen was  saying in her clear voice. \"I am surprised to learn that you love me  upon such short acquaintance, and am sorry, too, for I hardly know  whether I even so much as like you.\"    \"I love you. We men of the border do things rapidly,\" he replied  earnestly.    \"So it seems,\" she said with a soft laugh.    \"Won't you care for me?\" he pleaded.    \"Nothing is surer than that I never know what I am going to do,\" Helen  replied lightly.    \"All these fellows are in love with you. They can't help it any more  than I. You are the most glorious creature. Please give me hope.\"    \"Mr. Brandt, let go my hand. I'm afraid I don't like such impulsive  men.\"    \"Please let me hold your hand.\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"But I will hold it, and if you look at me like that again I'll do  more,\" he said.    \"What, bold sir frontiersman?\" she returned, lightly still, but in a  voice which rang with a deeper note.    \"I'll kiss you,\" he cried desperately.    \"You wouldn't dare.\"    \"Wouldn't I though? You don't know us border fellows yet. You come  here with your wonderful beauty, and smile at us with that light in  your eyes which makes men mad. Oh, you'll pay for it.\"    The borderman listened to all this love-making half disgusted, until  he began to grow interested. Brandt's back was turned to him, and  Helen stood so that the light from the pine cones shone on her face.  Her eyes were brilliant, otherwise she seemed a woman perfectly  self-possessed. Brandt held her hand despite the repeated efforts she  made to free it. But she did not struggle violently, or make  an outcry.    Suddenly Brandt grasped her other hand, pulling her toward him.    \"These other fellows will kiss you, and I'm going to be the first!\" he  declared passionately.    Helen drew back, now thoroughly alarmed by the man's fierce energy.  She had been warned against this very boldness in frontiersmen; but  had felt secure in her own pride and dignity. Her blood boiled at the  thought that she must exert strength to escape insult. She struggled  violently when Brandt bent his head. Almost sick with fear, she had  determined to call for help, when a violent wrench almost toppled her  over. At the same instant her wrists were freed; she heard a fierce  cry, a resounding blow, and then the sodden thud of a heavy body  falling. Recovering her balance, she saw a tall figure beside her, and  a man in the act of rising from the ground.    \"You?\" whispered Helen, recognizing the tall figure as Jonathan's.    The borderman did not answer. He stepped forward, slipping his hand  inside his hunting frock. Brandt sprang nimbly to his feet, and with a  face which, even in the dim light, could be seen distorted with fury,  bent forward to look at the stranger. He, too, had his hand within his  coat, as if grasping a weapon; but he did not draw it.    \"Zane, a lighter blow would have been easier to forget,\" he cried, his  voice clear and cutting. Then he turned to the girl. \"Miss Helen, I  got what I deserved. I crave your forgiveness, and ask you to  understand a man who was once a gentleman. If I am one no longer, the  frontier is to blame. I was mad to treat you as I did.\"    Thus speaking, he bowed low with the grace of a man sometimes used to  the society of ladies, and then went out of the gate.    \"Where did you come from?\" asked Helen, looking up at Jonathan.    He pointed under the lilac bushes.    \"Were you there?\" she asked wonderingly. \"Did you hear all?\"    \"I couldn't help hearin'.\"    \"It was fortunate for me; but why--why were you there?\"    Helen came a step nearer, and regarded him curiously with her great  eyes now black with excitement.    The borderman was silent.    Helen's softened mood changed instantly. There was nothing in his cold  face which might have betrayed in him a sentiment similar to that of  her admirers.    \"Did you spy on me?\" she asked quickly, after a moment's thought.    \"No,\" replied Jonathan calmly.    Helen gazed in perplexity at this strange man. She did not know how to  explain it; she was irritated, but did her best to conceal it. He had  no interest in her, yet had hidden under the lilacs in her yard. She  was grateful because he had saved her from annoyance, yet could not  fathom his reason for being so near.    \"Did you come here to see me?\" she asked, forgetting her vexation.    \"No.\"    \"What for, then?\"    \"I reckon I won't say,\" was the quiet, deliberate refusal.    Helen stamped her foot in exasperation.    \"Be careful that I do not put a wrong construction on your strange  action,\" said she coldly. \"If you have reasons, you might trust me. If  you are only----\"    \"Sh-s-sh!\" he breathed, grasping her wrist, and holding it firmly in  his powerful hand. The whole attitude of the man had altered swiftly,  subtly. The listlessness was gone. His lithe body became rigid as he  leaned forward, his head toward the ground, and turned slightly in a  manner that betokened intent listening.    Helen trembled as she felt his powerful frame quiver. Whatever had  thus changed him, gave her another glimpse of his complex personality.  It seemed to her incredible that with one whispered exclamation this  man could change from cold indifference to a fire and force so strong  as to dominate her.    Statue-like she remained listening; but hearing no sound, and  thrillingly conscious of the hand on her arm.    Far up on the hillside an owl hooted dismally, and an instant later,  faint and far away, came an answer so low as to be almost indistinct.    The borderman raised himself erect as he released her.    \"It's only an owl,\" she said in relief.    His eyes gleamed like stars.    \"It's Wetzel, an' it means Injuns!\"    Then he was gone into the darkness.          CHAPTER V    In the misty morning twilight Colonel Zane, fully armed, paced to and  fro before his cabin, on guard. All night he had maintained a watch.  He had not considered it necessary to send his family into the fort,  to which they had often been compelled to flee. On the previous night  Jonathan had come swiftly back to the cabin, and, speaking but two  words, seized his weapons and vanished into the black night. The words  were \"Injuns! Wetzel!\" and there were none others with more power to  affect hearers on the border. The colonel believed that Wetzel had  signaled to Jonathan.    On the west a deep gully with precipitous sides separated the  settlement from a high, wooded bluff. Wetzel often returned from his  journeying by this difficult route. He had no doubt seen Indian signs,  and had communicated the intelligence to Jonathan by their system of  night-bird calls.

Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#8)"],[1,"the right dial,  when the hand lies between 2 and 3, the 2, which is really 200, is read.    57. To compute the quantity of gas used, the dials are read from left to  right and the three readings are added. Then, in order to determine the  quantity burned since the previous reading, the amount registered at  that time, which is always stated on the gas bill, must be subtracted  from the new reading.    To illustrate the manner in which the cost of gas consumed may be  determined, assume that gas costs 90 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, that  the previous reading of the gas meter, say on May 15, was 52,600 cubic  feet, and that on June 15 the meter registered as shown in Fig. 1. As  was just explained, the left dial of the meter reads 5, the center dial  5, and the right dial 200. Therefore, put these figures down so that  they follow one another, as 5-5-200. This means then that the reading on  June 15 is 55,200 cubic feet. With this amount ascertained, subtract  from it the previous reading, or 52,600 cubic feet, which will give  2,600 cubic feet, or the quantity of gas burned from May 15 to June 15.  Since gas costs 90 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, the cost of the amount  burned, or 2,600 cubic feet, may be estimated by dividing 2,600 cubic  feet by 1,000 and multiplying the result by 90; thus 2,600 / 1,000 =  2.6, and 2.6 x .90 = 2.34    58. PREPAYMENT METERS.--In many places, gas concerns install what are  called prepayment meters; that is, meters in which the money is  deposited before the gas is burned. Such meters register the  consumption of the gas in the same way as the meters just mentioned, but  they contain a receptacle for money. A coin, generally a quarter, is  dropped into a slot leading to this receptacle, and the amount of gas  sold for this sum is then permitted to pass through as it is needed.  When this amount of gas has been burned, another coin must be inserted  in the meter before more gas will be liberated.      KEROSENE    59. In communities where gas is not available, kerosene, which is  produced by the refinement of petroleum, is used extensively as a fuel  for cooking, especially in hot weather when the use of a coal or a wood  stove adds materially to the discomfort of the person who does the  cooking. Kerosene is burned in stoves especially designed for its use,  and while it is a cheap fuel it is not always the same in quality. It  contains water at all times, but sometimes the proportion of water is  greater than at others. The greater the amount of water, the less fuel  will be contained in each gallon of kerosene. The quality of kerosene  can be determined by checking up the length of time the stove will burn  on a specified quantity of each new purchase of it.    Another product of the refinement of petroleum is _gasoline_. However,  it is not used so extensively for fuel as kerosene, because it is more  dangerous and more expensive.      ELECTRICITY    60. The use of electricity for supplying heat for cooking is very  popular in some homes, especially those which are properly wired,  because of its convenience and cleanliness and the fact that the heat it  produces can be applied direct. The first electrical cooking apparatus  was introduced at the time of the World's Fair in Chicago, in 1892, and  since that time rapid advancement has been made in the production of  suitable apparatus for cooking electrically. Electricity would  undoubtedly be in more general use today if it were possible to store it  in the same way as artificial gas, but as yet no such method has been  devised and its cost is therefore greater. Electricity is generated in  large power plants, and as it is consumed in the home for lighting and  cooking it passes through a meter, which indicates the quantity used in  much the same manner as a gas meter. It will be well, therefore, to  understand the way in which an electric meter is read, so that the bills  for electricity can be checked.    61. READING AN ELECTRIC METER.--An electric meter, which is similar in  appearance to a gas meter, consists of three or four dials, which are  placed side by side or in the shape of an arc. In the usual type, which  is shown in Fig. 2 and which consists of four dials placed side by side,  each one of the dials contains ten spaces and a hand, or indicator, that  passes over numbers ranging from to 9 to show the amount of  electricity used.    [Illustration: Fig 2.]    The numbers on the dials represent _kilowatt-hours_, a term meaning the  energy resulting from the activity of 1 kilowatt for 1 hour, or 1 watt,  which is the practical unit of electrical power, for 1,000 hours. Since  1,000 hours equal 1 kilowatt, 1,000 watt-hours equal 1 kilowatt-hour. It  will be observed from the accompanying illustration that the dial on the  extreme right has the figures reading in a clockwise direction, that is,  from right to left, the second one in a counter-clockwise direction, or  from left to right, the third one in a clockwise direction, and the  fourth one in a counter-clockwise direction; also that above each dial  is indicated in figures the number of kilowatt-hours that one complete  revolution of the hand of that dial registers.    To read the meter, begin at the right-hand dial and continue to the left  until all the dials are read and set the numbers down just as they are  read; that is, from right to left. In case the indicator does not point  directly to a number, but is somewhere between two numbers, read the  number that it is leaving. For example, in Fig. 2, the indicator in the  right-hand dial points to figure 4; therefore, this number should be put  down first. In the second dial, the hand lies between and 1, and as it  is leaving 0, this number should be read and placed to the left of the  first one read, which gives 04. The hand on the third dial points  exactly to 6; so 6 should be read for this dial and placed directly  before the numbers read for the first and second dials, thus, 604. On  the fourth and last dial, the indicator is between 4 and 5; therefore 4,  which is the number it is leaving should be read and used as the first  figure in the entire reading, which is 4,604.    After the reading of the electric meter has been ascertained, it is a  simple matter to determine the electricity consumed since the last  reading and the amount of the bill. For instance, assume that a meter  registers the number of kilowatt-hours shown in Fig. 2, or 4,604, and  that at the previous reading it registered 4,559. Merely subtract the  previous reading from the last one, which will give 45, or the number of  kilowatt-hours from which the bill for electricity is computed. If  electricity costs 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is the price charged in  some localities, the bill should come to 45 X .03 or $1.35.      PRINCIPLE OF STOVES    62. Before stoves for cooking came into use in the home, food was cooked  in open fireplaces. Even when wood was the only fuel known, a stove for  burning it, called the Franklin stove, was invented by Benjamin  Franklin, but not until coal came into use as fuel were iron stoves  made. For a long time stoves were used mainly for heating purposes, as  many housewives preferred to cook at the open fireplace. However, this  method of cooking has practically disappeared and a stove of some kind  is in use for cooking in every home.    63. For each fuel in common use there are many specially constructed  stoves, each having some advantageous feature; yet all stoves  constructed for the same fuel are practically the same in principle. In  order that fuel will burn and produce heat, it must have air, because  fuel, whether it is wood, coal, or gas, is composed largely of _carbon_  and air largely of _oxygen_, and it is the rapid union of these two  chemical elements that produces heat. Therefore, in order that each  stove may work properly, some way in which to furnish air for the fire  in the firebox must be provided. For this reason, every stove for  cooking contains passageways for air and is connected with a chimney,  which contains a flue, or passage, that leads to the outer air. When the  air in a stove becomes heated, it rises, and as it ascends cold air  rushes through the passageways of the stove to take its place. It is the  flue, however, that permits of the necessary draft and carries off  unburned gases. At times it is necessary to regulate the amount of air  that enters, and in order that this may be done each stove is provided  with _dampers_. These devices are located in the air passages and they  are so designed as to close off the air or allow the desired amount to  enter. By means of these dampers it is possible also to force the heat  around the stove oven, against the top of the stove, or up the chimney  flue. A knowledge of the ways in which to manipulate these dampers is  absolutely necessary if correct results are to be obtained from a stove.  The flue, however, should receive due consideration. If a stove is to  give its best service, the flue, in addition to being well constructed,  should be free from obstructions and kept in good condition. Indeed, the  stove is often blamed for doing unsatisfactory work when the fault is  really with the flue.    64. Probably one of the most important things considered in the  construction of stoves is the economizing of fuel, for ever since the  days of the fireplace there has been more or less of a tendency to save  fuel for cooking, and as the various kinds grow scarcer, and  consequently more expensive, the economical use of fuel becomes a  necessity. While most stoves for cooking purposes are so constructed as  to save fuel, many of them do not, especially if the method of caring  for them is not understood. Any housewife, however, can economize in the  use of fuel if she will learn how the stove she has must be operated;  and this can be done by following closely the directions that come with  the stove when it is purchased.
