For I have seen  The thorn frown rudely all the winter long  And after bear the rose upon its top;  And bark, that all the way across the sea  Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,  E'en in the haven's mouth seeing one steal,  Another brine, his offering to the priest,  Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence  Into heav'n's counsels deem that they can pry:  For one of these may rise, the other fall.\"          CANTO XIV    From centre to the circle, and so back  From circle to the centre, water moves  In the round chalice, even as the blow  Impels it, inwardly, or from without.  Such was the image glanc'd into my mind,  As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas'd;  And Beatrice after him her words  Resum'd alternate: \"Need there is (tho' yet  He tells it to you not in words, nor e'en  In thought) that he should fathom to its depth  Another mystery.  Tell him, if the light,  Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you  Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,  How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,  The sight may without harm endure the change,  That also tell.\"  As those, who in a ring  Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth  Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;  Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,  The saintly circles in their tourneying  And wond'rous note attested new delight.    Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb  Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live  Immortally above, he hath not seen  The sweet refreshing, of that heav'nly shower.    Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns  In mystic union of the Three in One,  Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice  Sang, with such melody, as but to hear  For highest merit were an ample meed.  And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,  With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps  The angel's once to Mary, thus replied:  \"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,  Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,  As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;  And that as far in blessedness exceeding,  As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.  Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds  Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,  Show yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase,  Whate'er of light, gratuitous, imparts  The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,  The better disclose his glory: whence  The vision needs increasing, much increase  The fervour, which it kindles; and that too  The ray, that comes from it.  But as the greed  Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines  More lively than that, and so preserves  Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere  Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,  Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth  Now covers.  Nor will such excess of light  O'erpower us, in corporeal organs made  Firm, and susceptible of all delight.\"    So ready and so cordial an \"Amen,\"  Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke  Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance  Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,  Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd,  Ere they were made imperishable flame.    And lo! forthwith there rose up round about  A lustre over that already there,  Of equal clearness, like the brightening up  Of the horizon.  As at an evening hour  Of twilight, new appearances through heav'n  Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;  So there new substances, methought began  To rise in view; and round the other twain  Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.    O gentle glitter of eternal beam!  With what a such whiteness did it flow,  O'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair,  So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd,  Mind cannot follow it, nor words express  Her infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain'd  Power to look up, and I beheld myself,  Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss  Translated: for the star, with warmer smile  Impurpled, well denoted our ascent.    With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks  The same in all, an holocaust I made  To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd.  And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd  The fuming of that incense, when I knew  The rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen  And mantling crimson, in two listed rays  The splendours shot before me, that I cried,  \"God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!\"    As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,  Distinguish'd into greater lights and less,  Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;  So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,  Those rays describ'd the venerable sign,  That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.  Here memory mocks the toil of genius.  Christ  Beam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now.  But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ  Will pardon me for that I leave untold,  When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy  The glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn,  And 'tween the summit and the base did move  Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd.  Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,  Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,  The atomies of bodies, long or short,  To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line  Checkers the shadow, interpos'd by art  Against the noontide heat.  And as the chime  Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help  With many strings, a pleasant dining makes  To him, who heareth not distinct the note;  So from the lights, which there appear'd to me,  Gather'd along the cross a melody,  That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment  Possess'd me.  Yet I mark'd it was a hymn  Of lofty praises; for there came to me  \"Arise and conquer,\" as to one who hears  And comprehends not.  Me such ecstasy  O'ercame, that never till that hour was thing  That held me in so sweet imprisonment.    Perhaps my saying over bold appears,  Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,  Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.  But he, who is aware those living seals  Of every beauty work with quicker force,  The higher they are ris'n; and that there  I had not turn'd me to them; he may well  Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse  I do accuse me, and may own my truth;  That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd,  Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.          CANTO XV    True love, that ever shows itself as clear  In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,  Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd  The sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand  Unwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers  Should they not hearken, who, to give me will  For praying, in accordance thus were mute?  He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,  Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,  Despoils himself forever of that love.    As oft along the still and pure serene,  At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,  Attracting with involuntary heed  The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,  And seems some star that shifted place in heav'n,  Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,  And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,  That on the dexter of the cross extends,  Down to its foot, one luminary ran  From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem  Dropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy list  Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.    So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught  Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost  Of old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,  When he perceiv'd his son.  \"O thou, my blood!  O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,  As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate  Been e'er unclos'd?\" so spake the light; whence I  Turn'd me toward him; then unto my dame  My sight directed, and on either side  Amazement waited me; for in her eyes  Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine  Had div'd unto the bottom of my grace  And of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith  To hearing and to sight grateful alike,  The spirit to his proem added things  I understood not, so profound he spake;  Yet not of choice but through necessity  Mysterious; for his high conception scar'd  Beyond the mark of mortals.  When the flight  Of holy transport had so spent its rage,  That nearer to the level of our thought  The speech descended, the first sounds I heard  Were, \"Best he thou, Triunal Deity!  That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!\"  Then follow'd: \"No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,  Which took me reading in the sacred book,  Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,  Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,  From whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her.  Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes  Begirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me  From him transmitted, who is first of all,  E'en as all numbers ray from unity;  And therefore dost not ask me who I am,  Or why to thee more joyous I appear,  Than any other in this gladsome throng.  The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue  Both less and greater in that mirror look,  In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown.  But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,  Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,  May be contended fully, let thy voice,  Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth  Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,  Whereto my ready answer stands decreed.\"    I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard  Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,  That to my will gave wings; and I began  \"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd  The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,  Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;  For that they are so equal in the sun,  From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,  As makes all likeness scant.  But will and means,  In mortals, for the cause ye well discern,  With unlike wings are fledge.  A mortal I  Experience inequality like this,  And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,  For thy paternal greeting.  This howe'er  I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st  This precious jewel, let me hear thy name.\"    \"I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect  Even, hath pleas'd me:\" thus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#9)"],[1,"e, on the very edge,  Our steps we stay'd.  It was an area wide  Of arid sand and thick, resembling most  The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.       Vengeance of Heav'n! Oh ! how shouldst thou be fear'd  By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!       Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,  All weeping piteously, to different laws  Subjected:  for on the' earth some lay supine,  Some crouching close were seated, others pac'd  Incessantly around; the latter tribe,  More numerous, those fewer who beneath  The torment lay, but louder in their grief.       O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down  Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow  On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd.  As in the torrid Indian clime, the son  Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band  Descending, solid flames, that to the ground  Came down:  whence he bethought him with his troop  To trample on the soil; for easier thus  The vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;  So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith  The marble glow'd underneath, as under stove  The viands, doubly to augment the pain.  Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,  Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off  The heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began:  \"Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,  Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth  To stop our entrance at the gate, say who  Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not  The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,  As by the sultry tempest immatur'd?\"       Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd  My guide of him, exclaim'd:  \"Such as I was  When living, dead such now I am.  If Jove  Weary his workman out, from whom in ire  He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day  Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out  At their black smithy labouring by turns  In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;  \"Help, help, good Mulciber!\" as erst he cried  In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts  Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,  He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.\"       Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd  Than I before had heard him:  \"Capaneus!  Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride  Lives yet unquench'd:  no torrent, save thy rage,  Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full.\"       Next turning round to me with milder lip  He spake:  \"This of the seven kings was one,  Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,  As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,  And sets his high omnipotence at nought.  But, as I told him, his despiteful mood  Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.  Follow me now; and look thou set not yet  Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood  Keep ever close.\"  Silently on we pass'd  To where there gushes from the forest's bound  A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts  My hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs  From Bulicame, to be portion'd out  Among the sinful women; so ran this  Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank  Stone-built, and either margin at its side,  Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.       \"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate  We enter'd first, whose threshold is to none  Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,  As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,  O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd.\"       So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,  That having giv'n me appetite to know,  The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.       \"In midst of ocean,\" forthwith he began,  \"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,  Under whose monarch in old times the world  Liv'd pure and chaste.  A mountain rises there,  Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,  Deserted now like a forbidden thing.  It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,  Chose for the secret cradle of her son;  And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts  His infant cries.  Within the mount, upright  An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns  His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome  As in his mirror looks.  Of finest gold  His head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast  And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.  And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,  Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which  Than on the other more erect he stands,  Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;  And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd  Penetrate to that cave.  They in their course  Thus far precipitated down the rock  Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;  Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence  Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,  Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself  Shall see it) I here give thee no account.\"       Then I to him:  \"If from our world this sluice  Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now  Appears it at this edge?\"  He straight replied:  \"The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part  Thou have already pass'd, still to the left  Descending to the nethermost, not yet  Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.  Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,  It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.\"       Then I again inquir'd:  \"Where flow the streams  Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one  Thou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,  Thou say'st, is form'd.\"  He answer thus return'd:  \"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear.  Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd  One thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see,  But not within this hollow, in the place,  Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,  Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd.\"  He added:  \"Time is now we quit the wood.  Look thou my steps pursue:  the margins give  Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;  For over them all vapour is extinct.\"        CANTO XV    One of the solid margins bears us now  Envelop'd in the mist, that from the stream  Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire  Both piers and water.  As the Flemings rear  Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back  The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide  That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs  Along the Brenta, to defend their towns  And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt  On Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,  So fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these  Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er  He was, that rais'd them here.  We from the wood  Were not so far remov'd, that turning round  I might not have discern'd it, when we met  A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.       They each one ey'd us, as at eventide  One eyes another under a new moon,  And toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,  As an old tailor at his needle's eye.       Thus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,  I was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt  Caught me, and cried, \"What wonder have we here!\"       And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,  Intently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,  That although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not  But I remember'd him; and towards his face  My hand inclining, answer'd:  \"Sir! Brunetto!  And art thou here?\"  He thus to me:  \"My son!  Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto  Latini but a little space with thee  Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.\"       I thus to him replied:  \"Much as I can,  I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,  That I here seat me with thee, I consent;  His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd.\"       \"O son!\" said he, \" whoever of this throng  One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,  No fan to ventilate him, when the fire  Smites sorest.  Pass thou therefore on.  I close  Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin  My troop, who go mourning their endless doom.\"       I dar'd not from the path descend to tread  On equal ground with him, but held my head  Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.       \"What chance or destiny,\" thus be began,  \"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?  And who is this, that shows to thee the way?\"       \"There up aloft,\" I answer'd, \"in the life  Serene, I wander'd in a valley lost,  Before mine age had to its fullness reach'd.  But yester-morn I left it:  then once more  Into that vale returning, him I met;  And by this path homeward he leads me back.\"       \"If thou,\" he answer'd, \"follow but thy star,  Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:  Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd.  And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,  Seeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I  Had gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.  But that ungrateful and malignant race,  Who in old times came down from Fesole,  Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,  Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.  Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs  It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.  Old fame reports them in the world for blind,  Covetous, envious, proud.  Look to it well:  Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.  For thee  Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,  That thou by either party shalt be crav'd  With hunger keen:  but be the fresh herb far  From the goat's tooth.  The herd of Fesole  May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,  If any such yet spring on their rank bed,  In which the holy seed revives, transmitted  From those true Romans, who still there remain'd,  When it was made the nest of so much ill.\"       \"Were all my wish fulfill'd,\" I straight replied,  \"Thou from the confines of man's nature yet  Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind  Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart  The dear, benign, paternal image, such  As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me  The way for man to win eternity;  And how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,  That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,  What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:  And with another text to comment on  For her I keep it, the celestial dame,  Who will know all, if I to her arrive.  This only would I have thee clearly note:  That so my conscience have no plea against me;  Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd.  Not new or strange such earnest to "]]]
