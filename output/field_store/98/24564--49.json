In view of this,  the necessary instructions were issued, and the presidency given to  Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, alcalde of the Audiencia of Mexico, and a  native of the town of Alcala de Henares. He went to the islands with  the usual reënforcements from Nueva España, taking with him the royal  seal of the Audiencia, the auditors whom his Majesty was sending, the  fiscal, and other officials and assistants of the said Audiencia. The  auditors and fiscal were Licentiates Melchior de Avalos, Pedro de  Rojas, and Gaspar de Ayala--[the latter] as fiscal. At the end of  two years, Don Antonio de Ribera went as third auditor.        ¶ Of the administration of Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, and of the  establishment of the Manila Audiencia, and until its suppression;  and of events during his term.    ¶ CHAPTER FOURTH    The president and auditors arrived at the Filipinas in the month of  May, in the year 1584, while Diego Ronquillo was governing. Doctor  Sanctiago de Vera entered upon his office, and immediately established  the Audiencia. The royal seal was received and deposited with all  possible solemnity and festivity. Then they began to attend to the  affairs both of justice and of war and government, to the great profit  of the country. At this time new reënforcements were sent to Maluco  for the conquests that the chief captain of Tidore intended to make  of the island of Terrenate. Captain Pedro Sarmiento [33] went from  Manila for this purpose, and on another occasion the captain and  sargento-mayor, Juan de Moron; [34] but neither of these expeditions  met with the desired result.    President Sanctiago de Vera also continued the pacification of  several provinces of the islands, and did many things, which  proved advantageous in every respect. He discovered a rebellion  and insurrection which the native chiefs of Manila and Pampanga had  planned against the Spaniards, and justice was done the guilty. [35]  He built with stone the fortress of Nuestra Señora de Guia [Our Lady  of Guidance], within the city of Manila on the land side, and for  its defense he caused some artillery to be founded by an old Indian,  called Pandapira, a native of the province of Panpanga. The latter  and his sons rendered this service for many years afterward, until  their deaths.    During the administration of President Sanctiago de Vera, the  Englishman Thomas Escander, [36] entered the South Sea through  the Strait of Magallanes; on the coast of Nueva España, close to  California, he had captured the ship \"Santa Ana,\" which was coming  from the Filipinas laden with a quantity of gold and merchandise of  great value. Thence he proceeded to the Filipinas; entering through  the province of Pintados, he came in sight of the town of Arevalo and  of the shipyard where a galleon was being built for the navigation  of the Nueva España line. Wishing to burn this vessel, he made the  attempt, but he was resisted by Manuel Lorenzo de Lemos, who was  supervising its construction. The Englishman passed on, and went  to India, whence he took his course to Inglaterra, having followed  the same route which the Englishman Francisco Draque [Francis Drake]  [37] had taken several years before. The latter had, in like manner,  passed through the Strait of Magallanes to the Peruvian coast, where  he made many prizes.    At this time, the Audiencia and the bishop thought it advisable  that some person of sufficient and satisfactory qualities should be  sent to España, to the court of his Majesty, to give a thorough and  detailed account of the state of affairs in the Filipinas Islands,  and to request that some necessary measures might be taken concerning  them. The court was especially to be informed that, for the time being,  the Audiencia could be dispensed with, for it was a heavy burden to  all estates, because of the newness of the country. The person of  Father Alonso Sanches, of the Society of Jesus, a learned man, and one  well informed concerning the country, and very active in business, was  chosen for this purpose. Instructions were given him, and authority to  act for all estates, religious orders, and communities, as to what he  was to treat and request in España, and at the court of his Holiness  in Roma, where he was also to go. [38] This father reached Madrid,  and after having conferred with his Majesty several times respecting  those things of which he thought fit to treat and to make requests,  went to Roma, where he introduced himself as the ambassador of all  the estates of the Filipinas, and on their behalf he kissed the foot,  and visited the pontiffs who ruled during that time, after the death  of Sixtus the Fifth. Having received from them favors and indulgences  with many relics, bulls, and letters for the Filipinas, he returned to  España, where again he solicited a decision on the business which he  had left under discussion when he went to Roma. His Majesty listened  to the messages that he brought from the pontiffs, and lent him  a favorable ear concerning the affairs of the islands. In private  audiences the father made the king understand his requests, and decide  them to his own satisfaction. But as soon as the despatches reached  the Filipinas, much of their contents appeared outside the intention  and expectation of both bishop and Audiencia, and the city, citizens,  and encomenderos. They appeared even detrimental to the inhabitants  of the islands, and therefore they expressed their displeasure toward  Father Alonso Sanches, who was still in España. The father negotiated  for the suppression of the Audiencia of Manila, and the appointment  of a new governor; and in begging such an one, the same father,  because of his friendly relations with him, proposed one Gomez Perez  Dasmariñas, who had been corregidor of Leon and later of Murcia, and  who was at that time in the court, and corregidor-elect of Logroño  and Calahorra. His Majesty appointed him governor and captain-general  of the Filipinas, and increased the annual salary of his office to ten  thousand Castilian ducados. Moreover, he made him a knight of the Order  of Sanctiago, and gave him a large sum of money with which to meet the  expenses of the voyage. He was provided with the necessary despatches,  both for the exercise of his office, and for the suppression of the  Audiencia of Manila, and the establishment of a camp of four hundred  paid soldiers with their officers, at his Majesty's expense, for the  garrison and defense of the land. His Majesty ordered him to sail  immediately for Nueva España in the ships on which Viceroy Don Luis de  Velasco sailed in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine,  who was going to govern that country.    Gomez Perez Dasmariñas left Mexico as soon as possible, and with what  ships, soldiers, and captains he needed, sailed for the Filipinas,  where he arrived in the month of May, in the year one thousand five  hundred and ninety.        ¶ Of the administration of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, and of Licentiate  Pedro de Rojas, who was elected by the city of Manila to act as  governor, on account of the former's death, until Don Luis Dasmariñas  was received as the successor of Gomez Perez, his father.    ¶ CHAPTER FIFTH    As soon as Gomez Perez Dasmariñas reached the Filipinas, he was  received as governor with universal acclaim. He suppressed the  Audiencia, and the residencias of its president, auditors, fiscal,  and other officials were taken by Licentiate Herver del Coral, whom  Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco had sent for that purpose, by virtue of a  royal decree received to that effect. The new governor inaugurated his  rule by establishing the paid garrison, and by executing, with great  enthusiasm and zeal, many and various things, for which he possessed  royal orders and instructions, not shrinking from any kind of labor,  or taking any care of himself. His first labor was the walling of the  city, to which he attended so assiduously, that it was almost completed  before his death. [39] He also built a cavalier on the promontory of  Manila where the old wooden fort, which he called Sanctiago, formerly  stood, and fortified it with some artillery. He razed to the ground  the fort of Nuestra Señora de Guia, which his predecessor had built; he  built of stone the cathedral of Manila, and encouraged the inhabitants  of the city who had shortly before begun to build, to persevere in  building their houses of stone, a work which the bishop was the first  to begin in the building of his house. During his term he increased  trade with China, and regulated better the navigation of Nueva España,  and the despatch of vessels in that line. He built some galleys for  the defense of the coast, pacified the Zambales, who had revolted,  and ordered his son Don Luys Dasmariñas, of the habit of Alcantara,  to make an incursion with troops from Manila into the interior of the  island of Luzon, [40] by crossing the river Ytui and other provinces  not yet explored or seen by Spaniards, until he arrived at Cagayan. He  built also an artillery foundry in Manila, where, for want of expert  founders, but few large pieces were turned out.    In the first year of his administration, he sent the president and  auditors of the suppressed Audiencia to España. Licentiate Pedro de  Rojas, the senior auditor, remained with the governor by order of  his Majesty, as lieutenant-assessor in matters of justice, until some  years later appointed alcalde in Mexico.    During Gomez Perez's administration, the relations and peace existing  between the Japanese and the Spaniards of the Filipinas began to  become strained; for hitherto Japanese"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary — Complete (#8)"],[1," of your ain to look  after--I have ane mysell--a ganging plea that my father left me, and his  father afore left to him.

Well, well, the fish  and the chop, and the tarts, will do very well. But don't imitate the  cautious delay that you praise in the courts of justice.

As, notwithstanding his pledge to the contrary, the glorious delays of  the law were not without their parallel in the kitchen of the inn, our  younger traveller had an opportunity to step out and make some inquiry  of the people of the house concerning the rank and station of his  companion. The information which he received was of a general and less  authentic nature, but quite sufficient to make him acquainted with  the name, history, and circumstances of the gentleman, whom we shall  endeavour, in a few words, to introduce more accurately to our readers.    Jonathan Oldenbuck, or Oldinbuck, by popular contraction Oldbuck,  of Monkbarns, was the second son of a gentleman possessed of a small  property in the neighbourhood of a thriving seaport town on the  north-eastern coast of Scotland, which, for various reasons, we shall  denominate Fairport. They had been established for several generations,  as landholders in the county, and in most shires of England would have  been accounted a family of some standing. But the shire of----was filled  with gentlemen of more ancient descent and larger fortune. In the last  generation, also, the neighbouring gentry had been almost uniformly  Jacobites, while the proprietors of Monkbarns, like the burghers of  the town near which they were settled, were steady assertors of the  Protestant succession. The latter had, however, a pedigree of their  own, on which they prided themselves as much as those who despised them  valued their respective Saxon, Norman, or Celtic genealogies. The first  Oldenbuck, who had settled in their family mansion shortly after the  Reformation, was, they asserted, descended from one of the original  printers of Germany, and had left his country in consequence of the  persecutions directed against the professors of the Reformed religion.  He had found a refuge in the town near which his posterity dwelt,  the more readily that he was a sufferer in the Protestant cause, and  certainly not the less so, that he brought with him money enough to  purchase the small estate of Monkbarns, then sold by a dissipated laird,  to whose father it had been gifted, with other church lands, on the  dissolution of the great and wealthy monastery to which it had belonged.  The Oldenbucks were therefore, loyal subjects on all occasions of  insurrection; and, as they kept up a good intelligence with the borough,  it chanced that the Laird of Monkbarns, who flourished in 1745, was  provost of the town during that ill-fated year, and had exerted himself  with much spirit in favour of King George, and even been put to expenses  on that score, which, according to the liberal conduct of the existing  government towards their friends, had never been repaid him. By dint  of solicitation, however, and borough interest, he contrived to gain  a place in the customs, and, being a frugal, careful man, had found  himself enabled to add considerably to his paternal fortune. He had only  two sons, of whom, as we have hinted, the present laird was the younger,  and two daughters, one of whom still flourished in single blessedness,  and the other, who was greatly more juvenile, made a love-match with a  captain in the Forty-twa, who had no other fortune but his commission  and a Highland pedigree. Poverty disturbed a union which love would  otherwise have made happy, and Captain M'Intyre, in justice to his wife  and two children, a boy and girl, had found himself obliged to seek his  fortune in the East Indies. Being ordered upon an expedition against  Hyder Ally, the detachment to which he belonged was cut off, and no news  ever reached his unfortunate wife, whether he fell in battle, or was  murdered in prison, or survived in what the habits of the Indian tyrant  rendered a hopeless captivity. She sunk under the accumulated load of  grief and uncertainty, and left a son and daughter to the charge of her  brother, the existing Laird of Monkbarns.    The history of that proprietor himself is soon told. Being, as we have  said, a second son, his father destined him to a share in a substantial  mercantile concern, carried on by some of his maternal relations. From  this Jonathan's mind revolted in the most irreconcilable manner. He was  then put apprentice to the profession of a writer, or attorney, in which  he profited so far, that he made himself master of the whole forms  of feudal investitures, and showed such pleasure in reconciling their  incongruities, and tracing their origin, that his master had great  hope he would one day be an able conveyancer. But he halted upon the  threshold, and, though he acquired some knowledge of the origin and  system of the law of his country, he could never be persuaded to  apply it to lucrative and practical purposes. It was not from any  inconsiderate neglect of the advantages attending the possession  of money that he thus deceived the hopes of his master. \"Were he  thoughtless or light-headed, or rei suae prodigus,\" said his instructor,  \"I would know what to make of him. But he never pays away a shilling  without looking anxiously after the change, makes his sixpence go  farther than another lad's half-crown, and wilt ponder over an old  black-letter copy of the acts of parliament for days, rather than go to  the golf or the change-house; and yet he will not bestow one of these  days on a little business of routine, that would put twenty shillings  in his pocket--a strange mixture of frugality and industry, and negligent  indolence--I don't know what to make of him.\"    But in process of time his pupil gained the means of making what he  pleased of himself; for his father having died, was not long survived by  his eldest son, an arrant fisher and fowler, who departed this life, in  consequence of a cold caught in his vocation, while shooting ducks in  the swamp called Kittlefittingmoss, notwithstanding his having drunk a  bottle of brandy that very night to keep the cold out of his stomach.  Jonathan, therefore, succeeded to the estate, and with it to the means  of subsisting without the hated drudgery of the law. His wishes were  very moderate; and as the rent of his small property rose with the  improvement of the country, it soon greatly exceeded his wants and  expenditure; and though too indolent to make money, he was by no means  insensible to the pleasure of beholding it accumulate. The burghers of  the town near which he lived regarded him with a sort of envy, as one  who affected to divide himself from their rank in society, and whose  studies and pleasures seemed to them alike incomprehensible. Still,  however, a sort of hereditary respect for the Laird of Monkbarns,  augmented by the knowledge of his being a ready-money man, kept up his  consequence with this class of his neighbours. The country gentlemen  were generally above him in fortune, and beneath him in intellect,  and, excepting one with whom he lived in habits of intimacy, had little  intercourse with Mr. Oldbuck of Monkbarns. He, had, however, the usual  resources, the company of the clergyman, and of the doctor, when he  chose to request it, and also his own pursuits and pleasures, being in  correspondence with most of the virtuosi of his time, who, like himself,  measured decayed entrenchments, made plans of ruined castles, read  illegible inscriptions, and wrote essays on medals in the proportion  of twelve pages to each letter of the legend. Some habits of hasty  irritation he had contracted, partly, it was said in the borough of  Fairport, from an early disappointment in love in virtue of which he had  commenced misogynist, as he called it, but yet more by the obsequious  attention paid to him by his maiden sister and his orphan niece, whom he  had trained to consider him as the greatest man upon earth, and whom he  used to boast of as the only women he had ever seen who were well  broke in and bitted to obedience; though, it must be owned, Miss Grizzy  Oldbuck was sometimes apt to jibb when he pulled the reins too tight.  The rest of his character must be gathered from the story, and we  dismiss with pleasure the tiresome task of recapitulation.    During the time of dinner, Mr. Oldbuck, actuated by the same curiosity  which his fellow-traveller had entertained on his account, made some  advances, which his age and station entitled him to do in a more direct  manner, towards ascertaining the name, destination, and quality of his  young companion.
