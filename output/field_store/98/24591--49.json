On the return to the boat, Mr. Barrallier  shot a large hawk. Our fishing-party had caught some fish, and would have  been very successful, but two sharks got into the seine and tore it in  several places: they were both brought on shore, one measuring seven feet  in length. The liver I ordered to be carried on board, to be boiled for  the oil and used in our lamp.    \"On the 11th of March, the wind still hanging to the south, I took some  hands on shore to cut a boatload of wood and fill our water  casks...Messieurs Barrallier and Caley, with two soldiers, accompanied me  on another excursion. We took another direction inland...but saw no  kangaroos. We met with two small lagoons and several streams of good  water running through the thickest part of the woods. In this excursion  we saw the Laughing Bird so called from the noise it makes resembling  laughter.* (* The Giant Kingfisher or Kookaburra.)    \"On our return to the boat we fell in with a spot of ground which  appeared to have been selected by the natives for the purposes of  festivity. It was a small eminence having no habitation near. We counted  the marks of fifteen different fires that had been employed in cooking  fish and other eatables, the bones of which were strewed about. Among  them we picked up part of a human skull--the os frontis with the sockets  of the eyes and part of the bones of the nose still attached to it. A  little distance from where we found this we discovered a part of the  upper jaw with one of the molars or back teeth in it, also one of the  vertebrae of the back having marks of fire which the others had not.    \"The grass was much trodden down, and many of the bones of the animals  eaten appeared fresh...I brought off the human bones and on getting on  board showed them to Euranabie. Finding two of the natives from the shore  in the vessel, I desired him to ask them whether these bones belonged to  a white man or not, and if they had killed and eaten him. I was anxious  to have this cleared up, as the ship Sydney Cove from India to Port  Jackson had been wrecked about twelve months before to the southward and  it was reported that some of the crew were killed by the natives near  this place.\"* (* The Sydney Cove from Bengal to New South Wales was  wrecked on Preservation Island, Tasmania, on 8th February, 1797. Her  long-boat was equipped and despatched on 27th February to Sydney, but the  boat filled and went to pieces at a spot called Ninety Mile beach. Out of  the crew of seventeen, who started to walk to Port Jackson, only three  lived to reach their destination--some dying of fatigue and hunger, the  others were murdered by the natives.)    Euranabie, who spoke English, made inquiries, and a soldier who  understood the Sydney dialect, also endeavoured to extract the truth  regarding the bones, from the two black fellows, who said that they were  those of a white man that had come in a canoe from the southward where  the ship \"tumble down,\" meaning that it had been wrecked. Lieutenant  Grant also questioned Worogan, and was informed that \"the bush natives  (who appeared to be a different tribe of people from those that lived by  the seaside) did eat human flesh.\"    He now prepared to leave the port. \"On the 12th, we got into a clean  berth for getting under weigh, but in the morning the wind being variable  and light we were prevented sailing. I went on shore with Mr. Barrallier  to make a survey of the cove we were lying in. When preparing to return  to the vessel we were joined by several natives who appeared anxious to  go on board with us. Two of these were strangers who signified that they  had come a long way to see us and that they were very hungry. They were  both young, stout men with longer hair than the natives generally.    \"In the afternoon...it was needless to attempt sailing till the wind  abated. I therefore proposed to survey...the western side of the island  which lies in the mouth of the harbour and shelters the cove from  easterly winds. This island I named Ann's Island, in compliment to Mrs.  King, the wife of the Governor.    \"In putting the surveying instruments into the boat the chain was found  missing; we were of opinion it had been left on shore by the soldiers who  carried it in measuring the distances. A boat with one of them was sent  on shore. After a fruitless search they were returning when a canoe put  off from the island with a man in it who held up the chain in his hand.  The boat's crew brought him on board to me. On looking at the chain it  was made up in the usual way...and tied with a piece of string; but in  undoing it I found that the natives had untwisted every bend of the wires  which contained the brass markers and after taking them off bent the  wires back into their original form, with this difference, that they  placed the end which is carried in the hand in the middle. This was the  first instance I had experienced of their pilfering anything and I did  not chuse to proceed to extremities. I gave the native a blanket and some  biscuits and the mate gave him an old hat.    \"We got into the boat to prosecute the intention of surveying the  island...the native with us, towing his canoe astern. On landing we were  joined by a great number of natives who seemed glad that the man had been  rewarded for carrying back the chain. The blanket attracted their notice  much, the use of which they appeared to know. The old man whom I formerly  mentioned was among them; he made signs for me to sit down at a distance  from the rest and by pointing to his white beard signified a wish to have  it cut off, which I immediately did with a pair of scissors, and he  expressed much satisfaction at being rid of it.\"    Observing some of their women in the distance and wishing to see what  they were like, signs were made to the old man to ask them to come  nearer. He called to them, whereupon they seated themselves close to the  visitors. They seemed nervous as the white men approached them, but when  the old chief spoke to them sat down again composedly. One of them had  fastened to the neck of her child a brass marker which had been taken  from the stolen chain. Grant says: \"They examined my buttons and the head  of my dirk and seemed much surprised at my watch chain which I began to  think they had an inclination for, but I was soon relieved on pulling out  my watch. They did not seem to like it and talked very gravely among  themselves; they were all anxious to listen to the noise of the watch,  yet they would pull their ear from it and look at the watch with symptoms  of fear...and then return to it again. I attempted to point out the use  of it and pointed to the sun, but I am led to think that they believed it  to be something we worshipped. The old man particularly pointed to the  sun and appeared anxious to know more of it.\"    A boy about twelve years of age who was a little deformed, carried a  sharp pointed stick in his hand which was the only weapon of defence seen  but it was soon perceived that they had weapons not far distant. The Lady  Nelson's commander by signs told the chief that he wanted fresh water.  \"The old native readily understood and getting up made me follow him to  the side of a hill where some water had settled, but it not appearing to  be from a spring, I expressed my desire to be taken to a rivulet. A  native stept forward, as I supposed, to show me, but on my following him  he turned back and left us. Thinking from the direction we were in that  water was not far distant I took one of my men with me to whom I gave my  fowling-piece to carry...We saw another native a little way before us to  whom I signified what I wanted.\" As Grant approached, this native, by a  sudden jerk of the foot, raised and caught up in his hand a spear; the  weapon rose within six inches of the Lieutenant's face and caused him to  turn and grasp his gun from his attendant. The native, however, merely  put the spear on his shoulder and walking leisurely towards a cliff stood  looking at the sea. It was not supposed anything hostile was meant but  the action showed that the natives had weapons concealed.    \"At 5 A.M. of the 13th, we weighed anchor with light variable airs and  got clear out of the cove by ten, when we found a moderate breeze from  north-east, and we made all possible sail to the southward.\"    Grant then gives his opinion of Jervis Bay, a place destined to be much  more important in the future of the continent, as it will serve as port  to Canberra, the seat of the Australian Government. \"It is worthy of  remark that Jarvis's Bay* (* i.e. Jervis Bay.) or sound is large,  commodious and easy of access, affording shelter from all winds and  having room for upwards of 200 sail of ships with plenty of wood and  water. When this bay comes to be more known, it will be found eligible  for vessels bound to Port Jackson after a long passage from England...and  will be the means of saving many lives.\"    From Jervis Bay the Lady Nelson continued her voyage southwards and, on  the 19th of March, off Point Hicks, she met with a strange sail which  proved to be the ship Britannia, Captain Turnbull, from England, bound  for the whale fishery. She was going to Sydney to refit, and thus gave  Grant an opportunity to send a letter to Governor King. He wrote as  follows:    POINT HICKS, NORTH BY EAST 12 MILES.    \"18th March, 1801.    \"SIR,--Seeing a vessel to windward, and judging you would wish to hear of  us...I sit down to write you a few lines before she joins us, as I  suppose she is bound to Sydney, and from her situation, I presume she is  one more who has come through the Straits. The Bee, no doubt, has arrived  long ere now. I, on the Tuesday morning after she parted, got safely into  Jarvis's Bay, and sailed early on Friday with the wind at the north-east  which only lasted 30 hours so that we have been nearly 5 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7514"],[0,"A Guide to Stoicism (#8)"],[1,"money with him and the other call to  reclaim it. The success of the trick however only went to establish  that Aristo was not the sage, an admission which each of the Stoics  seems to have been ready enough to make on his own part, as the  responsibilities of the position were so fatiguing.    There remains one more leading characteristic of the sage, the most  striking of them all, and the most important from the ethical point  of view. This was his innocence or harmlessness. He would not harm  others and was not to be harmed by them. For the Stoics believed with  Socrates that it was not permissible by the divine law for a better  man to be harmed by a worse. You could not harm the sage any more  than you could harm the sunlight; he was in our world, but not of it.  There was no possibility of evil for him, save in his own will, and  that you could not touch. And as the sage was beyond harm, so also  was he above insult. Men might disgrace themselves by their insolent  attitude towards his mild majesty, but it was not in their power to  disgrace him.    As the Stoics had their analogue to the tenet of final assurance, so  had they also to that of sudden conversion. They held that a man  might become a sage without being at first aware of it. The  abruptness of the transition from folly to wisdom was in keeping with  their principle that there was no medium between the two, but it was  naturally a point which attracted the strictures of their opponents.  That a man should be at one moment stupid and ignorant and unjust and  intemperate, a slave and poor, and destitute, at the next a king,  rich, and prosperous, temperate, and just, secure in his judgements  and exempt from error, was a transformation, they declared, which  smacked more of the fairy tales of the nursery than of the doctrines  of a sober philosophy.      PHYSIC    We have now before us the main facts with regard to the Stoic view of  man's nature, but we have yet to see in what setting they were put.  What was the Stoic outlook upon the universe? The answer to this  question is supplied by their Physic.    There were, according to the Stoics, two first principles of all  things, the active and the passive. The passive was that unqualified  being which is known as Matter. The active was the Logos, or reason  in it, which is God. This, it was held, eternally pervades matter and  creates all things. This dogma, laid down by Zeno, was repeated after  him by the subsequent heads of the school.    There were then two first principles, but there were not two causes  of things. The active principle alone was cause, the other was mere  material for it to work on--inert, senseless, destitute in itself of  all shape and qualities, but ready to assume any qualities or shape.    Matter was defined as that out of which anything is produced. The  Prime Matter, or unqualified being, was eternal and did not admit of  increase or decrease, but only of change. It was the substance or  being of all things that are.    The Stoics, it will be observed, used the term \"matter\" with the same  confusing ambiguity with which we use it ourselves, now for sensible  objects which have shape and other qualities, now for the abstract  conception of matter, which is devoid of all qualities.    Both these first principles, it must be understood, were conceived of  as bodies, though without form, the one everywhere interpenetrating  the other. To say that the passive principle, or matter, is a body  comes easy to us, because of the familiar confusion adverted to  above. But how could the active principle, or God, be conceived of as  a body? The answer to this question may sound paradoxical. It is  because God is a spirit. A spirit in its original sense meant air in  motion. Now the active principle was not air, but it was something  which bore an analogy to it--namely aether. Aether in motion might be  called a 'spirit' as well as air in motion. It was in this sense that  Chrysippus defined the thing that is, to be a spirit moving itself  into and out of itself, or spirit moving itself to and fro.    From the two first principles which are ungenerated and  indestructible must be distinguished the four elements which, though  ultimate for us, yet were produced in the beginning by God and are  destined some day to be reabsorbed into the divine nature. These with  the Stoics were the same which had been accepted since  Empedocles--namely earth, air, fire and water. The elements, like the  two first principles were bodies; unlike them, they were declared to  have shape as well as extension.    An element was defined as that out of which things at first come into  being and into which they are at last resolved. In this relation did  the four elements stand to all the compound bodies which the universe  contained. The terms earth, air, fire and water had to be taken in a  wide sense: earth meaning all that was of the nature of earth, air  all that was of the nature of air and so on. Thus, in the human  frame, the bones and sinews pertained to earth.    The four qualities of matter--hot, cold, moist and dry--were  indicative of the presence of the four elements. Fire was the source  of heat, air of cold, water of moisture, and earth of dryness.  Between them, the four elements made up the unqualified being called  Matter. All animals and other compound natures on earth had in them  representatives of the four great physical constituents of the  universe, but the moon, according to Chrysippus, consisted only of  fire and air, while the sun was pure fire.    While all compound bodies were resolvable into the four elements,  there were important differences among the elements, themselves. Two  of them, fire and air, were light; the other two, water and earth,  were heavy. By 'light' was meant that which tends away from its own  centre, by 'heavy,' that which, tends towards it. The two light  elements stood to the two heavy ones in much the same relation as the  active to the passive principle generally. But further, fire had such  a primary as entitles it, if the definition of element were pressed,  to be considered alone worthy of the name. For the three other  elements arose out of it and were to be again resolved into it.    We should obtain a wholly wrong impression of what Bishop Berkeley  calls 'the philosophy of fire' if we set before our minds in this  connection, the raging element whose strength is in destruction. Let  us rather picture to ourselves as the type of fire the benign and  beatific solar heat, the quickener and fosterer of all terrestrial  life. For according to Zeno, there were two kinds of fire, the one  destructive, the other what we may call 'constructive,' and which he  called 'artistic'. This latter kind of fire, which was known as  aether, was the substance of the heavenly bodies, as it was also of  the soul of animals and of the 'nature' of plants. Chrysippus,  following Heraclitus, taught that the elements passed into one  another by a process of condensation and rarefaction. Fire first  became solidified into air, then air into water and lastly water into  earth. The process of dissolution took place in the reverse order,  earth being rarefied into water, water into air, and air into fire.  It is allowable to see in this old world doctrine an anticipation of  the modern idea of different states of matter--the solid, the liquid,  and the gaseous, with a fourth beyond the gaseous which science can  still only guess at, and in which matter seems almost to merge into  spirit.    Each of the four elements had its own abode in the universe.  Outermost of all was the ethereal 'fire' which was divided into two  spheres: first that of the fixed stars and next that of the planets.  Below this lay the sphere of 'air', below this again that of 'water',  and lowest or in other words, most central of all was the sphere of  'earth', the solid foundation of the whole structure. Water might be  said to be above earth because nowhere was there water to be found  without earth beneath it, but the surface of water was always  equidistant from the centre, whereas earth had prominences which rose  above water.    When we say that the Stoics regarded the universe as a plenum, the  reader must understand by 'the universe' the Cosmos or ordered whole.  Within this there was no emptiness owing to the pressure of the  celestial upon the terrestrial sphere. But outside of this lay the  infinite void without beginning, middle, or end. This occupied a very  ambiguous position In their scheme. It was not being, for being was  confined to body and yet it was there. It was in fact nothing, and  that was why it was infinite. For as nothing cannot be bound to any  thing, so neither can there be any bound to nothing. But while  bodiless itself, it had the capacity to contain body, a fact which  enabled it, despite its non-entity, to serve, as we shall see, a  useful purpose.    Did the Stoics then regard the universe as finite or as infinite? In  answering this question we must distinguish our terms, as they did.  The All, they said, was infinite, but the Whole was finite. For the  'All' was the cosmos and the void, whereas the 'Whole' was the cosmos  only. This distinction we may suppose to have originated with the  later members of the school. For Appolodorus noted the ambiguity of  the word 'All' as meaning,       (1) the cosmos only,     (2) cosmos + void    If then by the term \"universe\" we understand the cosmos, or ordered  whole, we must say that the Stoics regarded the universe as finite.  All being and all body, which was the same thing with being, had  necessarily bounds, it was only not being, which was boundless.    Another distinction, due this time to Chrysippus himself, which the  Stoics found it convenient to draw, was between the three words  'void,' 'place' and 'space'. Void was defined as 'the absence of  body', place was that which was occupied by body, the term 'space"]]]
