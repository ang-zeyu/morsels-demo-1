[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763"],[0,"Aristotle on the art of poetry (#8)"],[1,"includes, together with the presupposed incidents, the  seizure of the child and that in turn of the parents; and the Denouement  all from the indictment for the murder to the end. Now it is right, when  one speaks of a tragedy as the same or not the same as another, to do so  on the ground before all else of their Plot, i.e. as having the same or  not the same Complication and Denouement. Yet there are many dramatists  who, after a good Complication, fail in the Denouement. But it is  necessary for both points of construction to be always duly mastered.  (5) There are four distinct species of Tragedy--that being the number  of the constituents also that have been mentioned: first, the complex  Tragedy, which is all Peripety and Discovery; second, the Tragedy  of suffering, e.g. the _Ajaxes_ and _Ixions_; third, the Tragedy of  character, e.g. _The Phthiotides_ and _Peleus_. The fourth constituent  is that of 'Spectacle', exemplified in _The Phorcides_, in _Prometheus_,  and in all plays with the scene laid in the nether world. The poet's  aim, then, should be to combine every element of interest, if possible,  or else the more important and the major part of them. This is now  especially necessary owing to the unfair criticism to which the poet is  subjected in these days. Just because there have been poets before him  strong in the several species of tragedy, the critics now expect the  one man to surpass that which was the strong point of each one of his  predecessors. (6) One should also remember what has been said more than  once, and not write a tragedy on an epic body of incident (i.e. one with  a plurality of stories in it), by attempting to dramatize, for instance,  the entire story of the _Iliad_. In the epic owing to its scale every  part is treated at proper length; with a drama, however, on the same  story the result is very disappointing. This is shown by the fact that  all who have dramatized the fall of Ilium in its entirety, and not part  by part, like Euripides, or the whole of the Niobe story, instead of a  portion, like Aeschylus, either fail utterly or have but ill success  on the stage; for that and that alone was enough to ruin a play by  Agathon. Yet in their Peripeties, as also in their simple plots, the  poets I mean show wonderful skill in aiming at the kind of effect they  desire--a tragic situation that arouses the human feeling in one, like  the clever villain (e.g. Sisyphus) deceived, or the brave wrongdoer  worsted. This is probable, however, only in Agathon's sense, when he  speaks of the probability of even improbabilities coming to pass. (7)  The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be an  integral part of the whole, and take a share in the action--that which  it has in Sophocles rather than in Euripides. With the later poets,  however, the songs in a play of theirs have no more to do with the Plot  of that than of any other tragedy. Hence it is that they are now singing  intercalary pieces, a practice first introduced by Agathon. And yet what  real difference is there between singing such intercalary pieces, and  attempting to fit in a speech, or even a whole act, from one play into  another?          19      The Plot and Characters having been discussed, it remains to consider  the Diction and Thought. As for the Thought, we may assume what is  said of it in our Art of Rhetoric, as it belongs more properly to  that department of inquiry. The Thought of the personages is shown in  everything to be effected by their language--in every effort to prove  or disprove, to arouse emotion (pity, fear, anger, and the like), or  to maximize or minimize things. It is clear, also, that their mental  procedure must be on the same lines in their actions likewise, whenever  they wish them to arouse pity or horror, or have a look of importance or  probability. The only difference is that with the act the impression has  to be made without explanation; whereas with the spoken word it has to  be produced by the speaker, and result from his language. What, indeed,  would be the good of the speaker, if things appeared in the required  light even apart from anything he says?    As regards the Diction, one subject for inquiry under this head is the  turns given to the language when spoken; e.g. the difference between  command and prayer, simple statement and threat, question and answer,  and so forth. The theory of such matters, however, belongs to Elocution  and the professors of that art. Whether the poet knows these things or  not, his art as a poet is never seriously criticized on that account.  What fault can one see in Homer's 'Sing of the wrath, Goddess'?--which  Protagoras has criticized as being a command where a prayer was meant,  since to bid one do or not do, he tells us, is a command. Let us pass  over this, then, as appertaining to another art, and not to that of  poetry.          20      The Diction viewed as a whole is made up of the following parts:  the Letter (or ultimate element), the Syllable, the Conjunction, the  Article, the Noun, the Verb, the Case, and the Speech. (1) The Letter is  an indivisible sound of a particular kind, one that may become a factor  in an intelligible sound. Indivisible sounds are uttered by the brutes  also, but no one of these is a Letter in our sense of the term. These  elementary sounds are either vowels, semivowels, or mutes. A vowel is a  Letter having an audible sound without the addition of another Letter.  A semivowel, one having an audible sound by the addition of another  Letter; e.g. S and R. A mute, one having no sound at all by itself, but  becoming audible by an addition, that of one of the Letters which have  a sound of some sort of their own; e.g. D and G. The Letters differ in  various ways: as produced by different conformations or in different  regions of the mouth; as aspirated, not aspirated, or sometimes one  and sometimes the other; as long, short, or of variable quantity; and  further as having an acute grave, or intermediate accent.    The details of these matters we must leave to the metricians. (2) A  Syllable is a nonsignificant composite sound, made up of a mute and a  Letter having a sound (a vowel or semivowel); for GR, without an A,  is just as much a Syllable as GRA, with an A. The various forms of the  Syllable also belong to the theory of metre. (3) A Conjunction is (a) a  non-significant sound which, when one significant sound is formable out  of several, neither hinders nor aids the union, and which, if the Speech  thus formed stands by itself (apart from other Speeches) must not be  inserted at the beginning of it; e.g. _men_, _de_, _toi_, _de_. Or (b)  a non-significant sound capable of combining two or more significant  sounds into one; e.g. _amphi_, _peri_, etc. (4) An Article is a  non-significant sound marking the beginning, end, or dividing-point of  a Speech, its natural place being either at the extremities or in  the middle. (5) A Noun or name is a composite significant sound not  involving the idea of time, with parts which have no significance by  themselves in it. It is to be remembered that in a compound we do not  think of the parts as having a significance also by themselves; in the  name 'Theodorus', for instance, the _doron_ means nothing to us.    (6) A Verb is a composite significant sound involving the idea of  time, with parts which (just as in the Noun) have no significance by  themselves in it. Whereas the word 'man' or 'white' does not imply  _when_, 'walks' and 'has walked' involve in addition to the idea of  walking that of time present or time past.    (7) A Case of a Noun or Verb is when the word means 'of or 'to' a thing,  and so forth, or for one or many (e.g. 'man' and 'men'); or it may  consist merely in the mode of utterance, e.g. in question, command, etc.  'Walked?' and 'Walk!' are Cases of the verb 'to walk' of this last kind.  (8) A Speech is a composite significant sound, some of the parts of  which have a certain significance by themselves. It may be observed that  a Speech is not always made up of Noun and Verb; it may be without a  Verb, like the definition of man; but it will always have some part with  a certain significance by itself. In the Speech 'Cleon walks', 'Cleon'  is an instance of such a part. A Speech is said to be one in two ways,  either as signifying one thing, or as a union of several Speeches made  into one by conjunction. Thus the _Iliad_ is one Speech by conjunction  of several; and the definition of man is one through its signifying one  thing.          21      Nouns are of two kinds, either (1) simple, i.e. made up of  non-significant parts, like the word ge, or (2) double; in the  latter case the word may be made up either of a significant and a  non-significant part (a distinction which disappears in the compound),  or of two significant parts. It is possible also to have triple,  quadruple or higher compounds, like most of our amplified names; e.g.'  Hermocaicoxanthus' and the like.    Whatever its structure, a Noun must always be either (1) the ordinary  word for the thing, or (2) a strange word, or (3) a metaphor, or (4) an  ornamental word, or (5) a coined word, or (6) a word lengthened out, or  (7) curtailed, or (8) altered in form. By the ordinary word I mean  that in general use in a country; and by a strange word, one in use  elsewhere. So that the same word may obviously be at once strange and  ordinary, though not in reference to the same people; _sigunos_, for  instance, is an ordinary word in Cyprus, and a strange word with us.  Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something  else; the transference being either from genus to species, or from  species to genus, or from species to species, or on grounds of analogy.  That from genus to species is eXemplified in 'Here stands my ship'; for  lying at anchor is the 'standing' of a particular kind of thing. That  from species to genus in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#8)"],[1,"irrepressibly the quavering voices sang on, verse after verse; others of  the colored people joined in; some whites on the platform began, but I  motioned them to silence. I never saw anything so electric; it made  all other words cheap; it seemed the choked voice of a race at last  unloosed. Nothing could be more wonderfully unconscious; art could  not have dreamed of a tribute to the day of jubilee that should be so  affecting; history will not believe it; and when I came to speak of it,  after it was ended, tears were everywhere. If you could have heard how  quaint and innocent it was! Old Tiff and his children might have sung  it; and close before me was a little slave-boy, almost white, who seemed  to belong to the party, and even he must join in. Just think of it!--the  first day they had ever had a country, the first flag they had ever seen  which promised anything to their people, and here, while mere spectators  stood in silence, waiting for my stupid words, these simple souls burst  out in their lay, as if they were by their own hearths at home! When  they stopped, there was nothing to do for it but to speak, and I went  on; but the life of the whole day was in those unknown people's song.    Receiving the flags, I gave them into the hands of two fine-looking  men, jet black, as color-guard, and they also spoke, and very  effectively,--Sergeant Prince Rivers and Corporal Robert Sutton. The  regiment sang \"Marching Along,\" and then General Saxton spoke, in his  own simple, manly way, and Mrs. Francis D. Gage spoke very sensibly to  the women, and Judge Stickney, from Florida, added something; then some  gentleman sang an ode, and the regiment the John Brown song, and then  they went to their beef and molasses. Everything was very orderly, and  they seemed to have a very gay time. Most of the visitors had far to go,  and so dispersed before dress-parade, though the band stayed to enliven  it. In the evening we had letters from home, and General Saxton had a  reception at his house, from which I excused myself; and so ended one  of the most enthusiastic and happy gatherings I ever knew. The day was  perfect, and there was nothing but success.    I forgot to say, that, in the midst of the services, it was announced  that General Fremont was appointed Commander-in-Chief,--an announcement  which was received with immense cheering, as would have been almost  anything else, I verily believe, at that moment of high tide. It was  shouted across by the pickets above,--a way in which we often receive  news, but not always trustworthy.      January 3, 1863.    Once, and once only, thus far, the water has frozen in my tent; and  the next morning showed a dense white frost outside. We have still  mocking-birds and crickets and rosebuds, and occasional noonday baths in  the river, though the butterflies have vanished, as I remember to have  observed in Fayal, after December. I have been here nearly six weeks  without a rainy day; one or two slight showers there have been, once  interrupting a drill, but never dress-parade. For climate, by day,  we might be among the isles of Greece,--though it may be my constant  familiarity with the names of her sages which suggests that impression.  For instance, a voice just now called, near my tent,--\"Cato, whar's  Plato?\" The men have somehow got the impression that it is essential to  the validity of a marriage that they should come to me for permission,  just as they used to go to the master; and I rather encourage these  little confidences, because it is so entertaining to hear them. \"Now,  Cunnel,\" said a faltering swam the other day, \"I want for get me one  good lady,\" which I approved, especially the limitation as to number.  Afterwards I asked one of the bridegroom's friends whether he thought  it a good match. \"O yes, Cunnel,\" said he, in all the cordiality of  friendship, \"John's gwine for marry Venus.\" I trust the goddess will  prove herself a better lady than she appeared during her previous career  upon this planet. But this naturally suggests the isles of Greece again.      January 7.    On first arriving, I found a good deal of anxiety among the officers as  to the increase of desertions, that being the rock on which the \"Hunter  Regiment\" split. Now this evil is very nearly stopped, and we are every  day recovering the older absentees. One of the very best things that  have happened to us was the half-accidental shooting of a man who  had escaped from the guard-house, and was wounded by a squad sent in  pursuit. He has since died; and this very eve-rung another man, who  escaped with him, came and opened the door of my tent, after being five  days in the woods, almost without food. His clothes were in rags, and he  was nearly starved, poor foolish fellow, so that we can almost dispense  with further punishment. Severe penalties would be wasted on these  people, accustomed as they have been to the most violent passions on the  part of white men; but a mild inexorableness tells on them, just as it  does on any other children. It is something utterly new to me, and it  is thus far perfectly efficacious. They have a great deal of pride as  soldiers, and a very little of severity goes a great way, if it be firm  and consistent. This is very encouraging.    The single question which I asked of some of the plantation  superintendents, on the voyage, was, \"Do these people appreciate  _justice_?\" If they did it was evident that all the rest would be easy.  When a race is degraded beyond that point it must be very hard to deal  with them; they must mistake all kindness for indulgence, all strictness  for cruelty. With these freed slaves there is no such trouble, not a  particle: let an officer be only just and firm, with a cordial, kindly  nature, and he has no sort of difficulty. The plantation superintendents  and teachers have the same experience, they say; but we have an immense  advantage in the military organization, which helps in two ways: it  increases their self-respect, and it gives us an admirable machinery for  discipline, thus improving both the fulcrum and the lever.    The wounded man died in the hospital, and the general verdict seemed to  be, \"Him brought it on heself.\" Another soldier died of pneumonia on  the same day, and we had the funerals in the evening. It was very  impressive. A dense mist came up, with a moon behind it, and we had only  the light of pine-splinters, as the procession wound along beneath the  mighty, moss-hung branches of the ancient grove. The groups around the  grave, the dark faces, the red garments, the scattered lights, the  misty boughs, were weird and strange. The men sang one of their own wild  chants. Two crickets sang also, one on either side, and did not cease  their little monotone, even when the three volleys were fired above the  graves. Just before the coffins were lowered, an old man whispered to me  that I must have their position altered,--the heads must be towards the  west; so it was done,--though they are in a place so veiled in woods  that either rising or setting sun will find it hard to spy them.    We have now a good regimental hospital, admirably arranged in a deserted  gin-house,--a fine well of our own digging, within the camp lines,--a  full allowance of tents, all floored,--a wooden cook-house to every  company, with sometimes a palmetto mess-house beside,--a substantial  wooden guard-house, with a fireplace five feet \"in de clar,\" where  the men off duty can dry themselves and sleep comfortably in bunks  afterwards. We have also a great circular school-tent, made of condemned  canvas, thirty feet in diameter, and looking like some of the Indian  lodges I saw in Kansas. We now meditate a regimental bakery. Our  aggregate has increased from four hundred and ninety to seven hundred  and forty, besides a hundred recruits now waiting at St. Augustine, and  we have practised through all the main movements in battalion drill.    Affairs being thus prosperous, and yesterday having been six weeks since  my last and only visit to Beaufort, I rode in, glanced at several camps,  and dined with the General. It seemed absolutely like re-entering the  world; and I did not fully estimate my past seclusion till it occurred  to me, as a strange and novel phenomenon, that the soldiers at the other  camps were white.      January 8.    This morning I went to Beaufort again, on necessary business, and by  good luck happened upon a review and drill of the white regiments. The  thing that struck me most was that same absence of uniformity, in minor  points, that I noticed at first in my own officers. The best regiments  in the Department are represented among my captains and lieutenants, and  very well represented too; yet it has cost much labor to bring them  to any uniformity in their drill. There is no need of this; for the  prescribed \"Tactics\" approach perfection; it is never left discretionary  in what place an officer shall stand, or in what words he shall give his  order. All variation would seem to imply negligence. Yet even West Point  occasionally varies from the \"Tactics,\"--as, for instance, in requiring  the line officers to face down the line, when each is giving the order  to his company. In our strictest Massachusetts regiments this is not  done.    It needs an artist's eye to make a perfect drill-master. Yet the small  points are not merely a matter of punctilio; for, the more perfectly  a battalion is drilled on the parade-ground the more quietly it can be  handled in action. Moreover, the great need of uniformity is this: that,  in the field, soldiers of different companies, and even of different  regiments, are liable to be intermingled, and a diversity of orders may  throw everything into confusion. Confusion means Bull Run.    I wished my men at the review to-day; for, amidst all the rattling and  noise of artillery and the galloping of cavalry, there was only one  infantry movement that we have"]]]
