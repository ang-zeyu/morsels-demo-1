Put them together, place on  salad plates garnished with lettuce, and serve with the  fruit-salad dressing.    77. FILBERT-AND-CHERRY SALAD.--If something different in the way of  salad is desired, cherries that have been seeded and then filled with  filberts will prove a delightful change. With this salad, which is shown  in Fig. 10, any salad dressing may be served, but fruit-salad dressing  makes it especially delicious.    [Illustration: FIG. 10]    78. DATE-AND-ENGLISH-WALNUT SALAD.--Persons who are fond of dates will  find a salad made of dates and walnuts very palatable. In addition, such  a salad is high in food value. Select firm whole dates, wash, and dry  between clean towels. Cut a slit in the side of each date and remove the  seed. Place half an English walnut meat inside and press the date  together. Garnish salad plates with lettuce and serve five or six of the  dates in a star shape for each serving. In the center, pour a spoonful  or two of cream salad dressing, boiled salad dressing, or any other  dressing that may be desired.    79. APPLE-DATE-AND-ORANGE SALAD.--The combination of fruits required by  the accompanying recipe is an easy one to procure in the winter time.  Apple-and-date salad is a combination much liked, but unless it is  served with a rather sour dressing, it is found to be too bland and  sweet for most persons. The addition of the orange gives just the acid  touch that is necessary to relieve this monotonous sweetness.    APPLE-DATE-AND-ORANGE SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. diced apples Lettuce  3/4 c. dates, seeded Salad dressing  2 oranges  Lettuce  Salad Dressing    Peel the apples and dice them into fine pieces. Wash the dates, remove  the seeds, and cut each date into six or eight pieces. Prepare the  oranges as directed for preparing oranges for salad, and cut each  section into two or three pieces. Just before serving, mix the fruits  carefully so as not to make the salad look mushy, pile in a neat heap on  garnished salad plates, and serve with any desired dressing.    80. CALIFORNIA SALAD.--During the months in which California grapes can  be found in the market, a very delicious salad can be made by combining  them with grapefruit and oranges. Either Malaga or Tokay grapes may  be used.    CALIFORNIA SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1-1/2 c. grapes  2 oranges Salad  1 grapefruit  Lettuce  Salad Dressing    Prepare the grapes by washing them in cold water, cutting them into  halves, and removing the seeds. Remove the sections from the oranges and  grapefruit in the way previously directed, and cut each section into  three or four pieces. Mix the fruits and drain carefully so that they  contain no juice or liquid. Pile in a heap on salad plates garnished  with lettuce and serve with any desired dressing.    81. BANANA-AND-PEANUT SALAD.--A very good fruit-and-nut combination for  a salad consists of bananas and ground peanuts. The bananas, after being  cut in half lengthwise, are rolled in the peanuts, placed on a lettuce  leaf, and served with dressing. If it is desired to improve the flavor,  the bananas may be dipped into the salad dressing before being rolled in  the peanuts.    Peel the required number of bananas, scrape the pithy material from  their surface, and cut in half lengthwise. Grind the peanuts rather fine  and roll each half of banana in them. Place on a garnished salad plate  and serve with boiled dressing.    82. FRUIT IN CANTALOUPE SHELLS.--During cantaloupe season, a delightful  fruit salad can be made by combining several different kinds of fruit  with the meat of cantaloupe and serving the mixture in the cantaloupe  shells. Such a salad is an excellent one to serve when dainty  refreshments are desired or when something unusual is wanted for a  nice luncheon.    Cut cantaloupes in half crosswise, and, using the French cutter, cut  some of the meat into round balls. Dice the remainder and mix with any  combination of fruit desired. Place this in the cantaloupe shells after  cutting points in the top edge. Garnish with the balls cut from the  cantaloupe and serve with any desired dressing.    83. PINEAPPLE-AND-NUT SALAD.--Because of its refreshing flavor,  pineapple makes a delicious salad. It may be combined with various  foods, but is very good when merely nuts and salad dressing are used, as  in the accompanying recipe.    Place slices of canned pineapple on salad plates garnished with lettuce  leaves. Mix whipped cream with salad dressing until the dressing becomes  stiff, and place a spoonful or two of this in the center of each slice  of pineapple. Sprinkle generously with chopped nuts, English walnuts or  pecans being preferable.    HIGH-PROTEIN SALADS    84. Salads that are made with cheese, eggs, fish, or meat may be classed  as HIGH-PROTEIN SALADS, for, as has already been learned, these foods  are characterized by the protein they contain. Of course, those made  almost entirely of meat or fish are higher in this food substance than  the others. However, the salads that contain a combination of cheese and  fruit are comparatively high in protein, and at the same time they  supply to the diet what is desirable in the way of a fruit salad.    [Illustration: FIG. 11]    85. POINSETTIA SALAD--Cream cheese, such as Neufchatel or Philadelphia  cream cheese, combines very well with some fruits and vegetables. It is  used with pineapple and cherries in the preparation of poinsettia salad,  which is illustrated in Fig. 11. As can be imagined, this makes a pretty  decoration for a Christmas table or a salad to be served around  holiday time.    POINSETTIA SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 pkg. cream cheese  Lettuce  2 Tb. cream  4 maraschino cherries  1/4 tsp. salt  Salad dressing  6 rounds pineapple    Mix the cream cheese with the cream and salt, and form this into small  round balls with the fingers. Place the rounds of pineapple on salad  plates garnished with lettuce, and put the cheese ball in the center of  the pineapple. Cut the maraschino cherries in half, and then cut each  half into narrow strips that resemble petals of a flower. Place five or  six of these over the top of the cream cheese with the points meeting in  the center, as shown in the illustration. Serve with any desired  dressing, but instead of adding the dressing to the salad put it in a  mayonnaise bowl and allow each person at the table to add it.    [Illustration: FIG. 12]      SALADS AND SANDWICHES    86. PEACH-AND-CREAM-CHEESE SALAD--An excellent way of using canned  peaches is to combine them with cream cheese for a salad, as shown in  Fig. 12. If a smaller salad is desired, half a peach may be used and the  cheese placed on top of it. Firm yellow peaches are the best ones to use  for this dish.    PEACH-AND-CREAM-CHEESE SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    Lettuce  Salad dressing  8 halves of pecans or walnuts  2 Tb. cream  1/4 tsp. salt  1 pkg. Cream cheese  8 halves canned peaches    Mix the cream and salt with the cheese and shape into balls. Place a  ball between two peach halves, and press them together tightly. Place on  garnished salad plates, pour salad dressing over the top, and garnish  with two halves of the nuts. If desired, the nuts may be chopped and  sprinkled over the top.    [Illustration: FIG. 13]    87. PEAR-AND-CHEESE SALAD--If other fruits are not in supply for use in  salad and pears can be obtained, they may be utilized with cream cheese  in a pleasing way, as Fig. 13 shows.    PEAR-AND-CHEESE SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    2 Tb. cream  Lettuce  1/4 tsp. salt  4 halves English walnuts  1 pkg. cream cheese  Salad dressing  8 halves canned pears    Mix the cream and salt with the cheese and shape into balls. Place  one-half of a pear with the hollow side up on a salad plate garnished  with a lettuce leaf and the other half with the hollow side down beside  it. Put a ball of the cheese in the hollow of the upturned half and  press half an English walnut on top of that. Add the dressing and serve.  French dressing is recommended for this salad, but some other salad  dressing will answer.    [Illustration: FIG. 14]    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    88. Green-Pepper-and-Cheese Salad.-In Fig. 14 is shown a  vegetable-and-cheese combination in the form of a salad made of green  pepper and cheese. To make this kind of salad, select firm green  peppers, one being sufficient if a large one can be obtained. Season  cream cheese well with paprika and a little additional salt if  necessary. Cut the top from the pepper, clean out the inside, and pack  tight with the cheese. Cut the filled pepper into thin slices, place  two or three of these slices on a salad plate garnished with lettuce  leaves, and serve with French dressing.    89. DAISY SALAD.--If an effective, somewhat ornamental salad is desired,  daisy salad, which is illustrated in Fig. 15, will prove satisfactory.  As will be observed, this salad resembles a daisy. To make it, cut  celery into strips about 2 inches long and trim one end of each round.  These strips will serve to represent the daisy petals. Place them on  salad plates garnished with lettuce, laying them so that they radiate  from the center and their round ends are toward the outside of the  plate. Then, for the center of the daisy effect, cut the yolks of  hard-cooked eggs into halves and place one half, with the rounded side  up, on the ends of the celery. Serve with French dressing.    [Illustration: FIG. 16]    90. HUMPTY DUMPTY SALAD.--In Fig. 16 is shown an attractive-appearing  and extremely appetizing salad known as Humpty Dumpty salad. It consists  of tomatoes and hard-cooked eggs garnished with pieces of stuffed  olives, the manner in which the egg is placed in each portion accounting  for its name.    For this salad, select rather small, firm, ripe tomatoes. Peel them in  the usual way, and when cutting out the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9939"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#8)"],[1,"serves, and jams.    The stems of some varieties of rhubarb are characterized by a great deal  of red color, while others are entirely green. The red rhubarb makes a  more attractive dish when it is cooked and served than the green, but it  has no better flavor. The outside of the stem has a skin that may be  removed by catching hold of it at one end with a knife and stripping it  off the remainder of the stem. It is not necessary to remove the skin  from young and tender rhubarb, but it is often an advantage to remove it  from rhubarb that is old. It should be remembered that the stems of  rhubarb contain considerable water and so require very little liquid in  their cooking.    75. STEWED RHUBARB.--Two methods of stewing rhubarb are in practice, the  one to select depending on the way it is preferred. In one method, which  keeps the pieces whole, the sugar and water are brought to the boiling  point before the rhubarb is added, while in the other, the rhubarb is  cooked with water until it is soft and the sugar then added.    STEWED RHUBARB  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. sugar  1/2 c. water  1 qt. cut rhubarb    Mix the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to the boiling point.  Wash the stems of the rhubarb and cut into inch lengths. Add the rhubarb  to the sirup and cook until it is tender enough to be pierced with a  fork. If desired, a flavoring of lemon peel may be added. Turn into a  dish, allow to cool, and serve.    If the other method is preferred, cook the rhubarb with the water until  it is soft and then add the sugar.           *       *       *       *       *    CITRUS FRUITS    CHARACTERISTICS    76. Fruits that contain citric acid are grouped together and are known  as CITRUS FRUITS. All of these are similar in structure, although they  differ in size, as will be observed from Fig. 4. Here the citrus fruits  most commonly used are illustrated, the large one in the center being a  grapefruit; the two to the left, oranges; the two to the right, lemons;  and the two in the front, tangerines.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    All varieties of these fruits are tropical or semitropical and are  shipped to the North in boxes that contain various numbers, the number  that can be packed in a box depending on the size of the fruit. The  south, southeastern, and western parts of the United States supply  practically all of these fruits that are found in the northern markets.  They stand storage well and keep for long periods of time if they are  packed before they are too ripe. These characteristics, together with  the fact that they are at their prime at different times in different  localities, make it possible to market such fruits during the entire  year, although they are much better at certain seasons than at others.    77. The majority of citrus fruits contain a fair amount of sugar and a  great deal of water; consequently, they are very juicy and refreshing. A  few of them, however, such as lemons and limes, contain very little  sugar and considerable acid and are therefore extremely sour. In the use  of such varieties, sugar must be added to make them palatable.    The greatest use made of citrus fruits is that of serving them raw.  However, they are also used in the making of marmalades, conserves, and  such confections as candied fruits. Then, too, the juice of a number of  them, such as lemons, oranges, and limes, makes very refreshing  beverages, so these varieties are much used for this purpose.      GRAPEFRUIT    78. Grapefruit, also known as _shaddock_, is a large, pale-yellow fruit  belonging to the citrus group. One variety, known as the _pomelo_, is  the kind that is commonly found in the market. It is slightly flattened  on both the blossom and stem ends.    Grapefruit has a typical flavor and a slightly bitter taste and contains  neither a great deal of sugar nor a large amount of acid. Because of its  refreshing, somewhat acid pulp and juice, it is highly prized as a fruit  to be eaten at breakfast or as an appetizer for a fruit cocktail. It is  also much used in the making of fruit salads.    79. SELECTION OF GRAPEFRUIT.--Grapefruit should be selected with care in  order that fruit of good quality may be obtained. Some persons think  that to be good grapefruit should be large, but it should be remembered  that size is not the factor by which to judge the quality. The fruit  should be heavy for its size and the skin should be fine-grained and  even. Coarse-grained skin, as a rule, is thick and indicates that the  pulp is rather pithy and without juice.    [Illustration: FIG. 5]    80. PREPARATION OF GRAPEFRUIT.--Different ways of serving grapefruit are  in practice, and it is well that these be understood. This is generally  considered a rather difficult fruit to eat, but if care is exercised in  its preparation for the table it can be eaten with comfort. For  preparing grapefruit, a narrow, sharp-bladed paring knife may be used.  As is well known, a grapefruit is always cut apart half way between the  stem and the blossom ends and a half served to each person.    [Illustration: FIG. 6]    81. One method of preparing grapefruit consists in cutting the skin in  such a way that the seeds can be taken out and the pulp then easily  removed with a spoon. To prepare it in this way, cut the grapefruit into  halves, and then, with a sharp knife, cut around the pithy core in the  center, cutting off the smallest possible end of each of the sections.  With this done, remove the seeds, which will be found firmly lodged near  the core and which can be readily pushed out with the point of the  knife. Then cut down each side of the skin between the sections so as  to separate the pulp from the skin. Around the edge next to the outside  skin, cut the pulp in each section with a single jab of the knife,  taking care not to cut the skin between the sections. The entire pulp of  each section, which will be found to be loose on both sides and ends if  the cutting is correctly done, can then be readily removed with a spoon.    [Illustration: FIG. 7]    82. In another method of preparing this fruit for the table, all the  skin inside of the fruit is removed and nothing but the pulp is left.  This method, which is illustrated in Figs. 5 to 10, inclusive, requires  a little more time and care than the previous one, but the result  justifies the effort. After cutting the grapefruit into halves, remove  the seeds with a sharp knife, as shown in Fig. 5. Then, with the same  knife, cut the grapefruit from the skin all the way around the edge, as  in Fig. 6; also, cut down each side of the skin between the sections, so  as to separate the pulp from the skin, as in Fig. 7. With the pulp  loosened, insert a pair of scissors along the outside edge, as in Fig.  8, and make a slanting cut toward the core.    [Illustration: FIG. 8]    Then, as in Fig. 9, cut the core loose from the outside skin. Repeat  this operation for each section. If the cutting has been properly done,  the core and skin enclosing the sections may be lifted out of the  grapefruit, and, as shown in Fig. 10, will then be in the form of a  many-pointed star. As only the pulp remains in the outside skin, the  grapefruit can be eaten without difficulty.    [Illustration: FIG. 9]    83. SERVING GRAPEFRUIT.--When grapefruit has been properly ripened, it  is rather sweet, so that many persons prefer it without sugar; but when  sugar is desired, the fruit is very much more delicious if it is  prepared some time before it is to be served, the sugar added to it, and  the fruit placed in a cool place. If this is done in the evening and the  grapefruit is served for breakfast, a large amount of very delicious  juice will have collected through the night. At any rate, grapefruit is  best if it is sweetened long enough before it is served to give the  sugar a chance to penetrate.    [Illustration: FIG. 10]      LEMONS    84. LEMONS are a citrus fruit raised in tropical regions. They are  shipped to other climates in cases that hold from 180 to 540, depending  on the size of the lemons, 300 to the case being a medium and commonly  used size. Their quality is judged like that of grapefruit; that is, by  their weight, the texture of their skin, and their general color  and shape.    Lemons contain very little sugar, but they are characterized by a large  amount of acid. Because of this fact, their juice is used to season  foods in much the same way as vinegar is used. In fact, their chief  uses are in making desserts and in seasoning such foods as custards,  pudding sauces, etc. However, their juice is also much used in the  making of beverages, such as lemonade and fruit punch.      ORANGES    85. ORANGES belong to the group of citrus fruits, but they differ from  both lemons and grapefruit in that they contain more sugar and less  acid. Two kinds of oranges supply the demands for this fruit, Florida  and California oranges. _Florida oranges_ have a skin more the color of  lemons and grapefruit and contain seeds, but they are considered to be  the finest both as to flavor and quality. _California oranges_, which  have a bright-yellow or orange skin, are seedless and are known as  _navel oranges_. As soon as the Florida season ends, the California  season begins; consequently, the market season for this fruit is a  lengthy one. The russet of oranges is caused by the bite of an insect on  the skin. To be shipped, oranges are packed in cases that will contain  from 48 to 400 to the case.    Probably no citrus fruit is used so extensively as oranges. Because of  their refreshing subacid flavor, they are much eaten in their fresh  state, both alone and in combination with other foods in numerous salads  and desserts.    [Illustration: FIG. 11]    86. PREPARATION OF ORANGES.--Several attractive ways of preparing  oranges for the table when they are to be eaten raw are shown in  Fig. 11.    To prepare them in the way shown at the left, cut the orange into two"]]]
