And why should one  enumerate the sums given to the Pretorians on the occasion of this  conspiracy or the excessive honors voted to Nero and his friends? Let me  say only that it led to the banishment of Rufus Musonius, the philosopher.  Sabina also perished at this time through an act of Nero's. Either  accidentally or intentionally he had given her a violent kick while she  was pregnant.    [Sidenote:--28--] The extremes of luxury indulged in by this Sabina I will  indicate in the briefest possible terms. She had gilded girths put upon  the mules that carried her and caused five hundred asses that had recently  foaled to be milked each day that she might bathe in their milk. She  devoted great thought to making her person appear youthful and lustrously  beautiful,--and with brilliant results; and this is why, not fancying her  appearance in a mirror one day, she prayed that she might die before she  passed her prime. Nero missed her so that [after her death, at first, on  learning that there was a woman resembling her he sent for and kept this  female: later] because a boy of the _liberti_ class, named Sporus,  resembled Sabina, he had him castrated and used him in every way like a  woman; and in due time he formally married him though he [Nero] was  already married to a freedman Pythagoras. He assigned the boy a regular  dowry according to contract, and Romans as well as others held a public  celebration of their wedding.    While Nero had Sporus the eunuch as a wife, one of his associates in Rome,  who had made a specialty of philosophy, on being asked whether the  marriage and cohabitation in question met with his approval replied: \"You  do well, Caesar, to seek the company of such wives. If only your father  had had the same ambition and had dwelt with a similar  consort!\"--indicating that if this had been the case, Nero would not have  been born, and the government would have been relieved of great evils.    This was, however, later. At the time with which we are immediately  concerned many, as I stated, were put to death and many who purchased  their preservation with Tigillinus with a great price were released.    [Sidenote:--29--] Nero continued to commit many ridiculous acts, among  which may be cited his descending at a kind of popular festival to the  orchestra of the theatre, where he read some Trojan lays of his own: and  in honor of these there were offered numerous sacrifices, as there were  over everything else that he did. He was now making preparations to  compile in verse a narration of all the achievements of the Romans: before  composing any of it, however, he began to consider the proper number of  books, and took as his adviser Annaeus Cornutus, who at this time was  famed for his learning. This man he came very near putting to death and  did deport to an island, because, while some were urging him to write four  hundred books, Cornutus said that was too many and nobody would read them.  And when some one objected: \"Yet Chrysippus, whom you praise and imitate,  has composed many more,\" the savant retorted: \"But they are a help to the  conduct of men's lives.\" So Cornutus was punished with exile for this. And  Lucanus was enjoined from writing poetry because he was securing great  praise for his work.

(A.D. 68 = a.u. 821,  to June 9th).      [Sidenote: A.D. 66 (a.u. 819)] [Sidenote:--1--] In the consulship  of Gaius Telesinus and Suetonius Paulinus one event of great glory and  another of deep disgrace took place. For one thing Nero contended among  the zither-players, and after Menecrates, [Footnote: This proper name is  the result of an emendation by Reimar.]the teacher of this art, had  celebrated a triumph for him in the hippodrome, he appeared as a  charioteer. For the other, Tiridates presented himself in Rome, bringing  with him not only his own children but those of Vologaesus, of Pacorus,  and of Monobazus. They were the objects of interest in a quasi-triumphal  procession through the whole country west from the Euphrates.  [Sidenote:--2--] Tiridates himself was in the prime of life, a notable  figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence: and his  whole train of servants together with the entourage of a royal court  accompanied the advance. Three thousand Parthian horsemen and besides them  numerous Romans followed his train. They were received by gaily decorated  cities and by peoples who shouted their compliments aloud. Provisions were  furnished them free of cost, an expenditure of twenty myriads for their  daily support being thus charged to the public treasury. This went on  without change for the nine months occupied in their journey. The prince  covered the whole distance to the confines of Italy on horseback and  beside him rode his wife, wearing a golden helmet in place of a veil, so  as not to defy the traditions of her country by letting her face be seen.  In Italy he was conveyed in a two-horse carriage sent by Nero and met the  emperor at Naples, which he reached by way of the Picentes. He refused,  however, to obey the order to put down his dagger when he approached the  Roman monarch, and he nailed it firmly to the scabbard. Yet he knelt upon  the ground, and with arms crossed called him master and did obeisance.  [Sidenote:--3--] Nero manifested his approbation of this act and  entertained him in many ways, one of which was a gladiatorial show at  Puteoli. The person who directed the contests was Patrobius, one of his  freedmen. He managed to make it a brilliant and costly affair, as is shown  by the fact that on one of the days not a person but Ethiopians, men,  women, and children, appeared in the theatre. By way of showing Patrobius  some proper honor Tiridates shot at beasts from his elevated seat. And, if  we may trust the report, he transfixed and killed two bulls together with  one arrow.    [Sidenote:--4--] After this affair Nero took him up to Rome and set the  diadem upon his head. The entire city had been decorated with lights and  garlands, and great crowds of people were to be seen everywhere, the  Forum, however, being especially full. The center was occupied by the  populace, arranged according to rank, clad in white and carrying laurel  branches: everywhere else were the soldiers, arrayed in shining armor,  their weapons and standards reflecting back the sunbeams. The very roof  tiles of the buildings in this vicinity were completely hidden from view  by the spectators who had ascended to these points of vantage. Everything  was in readiness by the time night drew to a close and at daybreak Nero,  wearing the triumphal garb and accompanied by the senate and the  Pretorians, entered the Forum. He ascended the rostra and seated himself  upon the chair of state. Next Tiridates and his suite passed through rows  of heavy-armed men drawn up on each side, took their stand close to the  rostra, and did obeisance to the emperor as they had done before.  [Sidenote:--5--] At this a great roar went up which so alarmed Tiridates  that for some moments he stood speechless, in terror of his life. Then,  silence having been proclaimed, he recovered courage and quelling his  pride made himself subservient to the occasion and to his need, caring  little how humbly he spoke, in view of the prize he hoped to obtain. These  were his words: \"Master, I am the descendant of Arsaces, brother of the  princes Vologaesus and Pacorus, and thy slave. And I have come to thee, my  deity, to worship thee as I do Mithra. The destiny thou spinnest for me  shall be mine: for thou art my Fortune and my Fate.\"    Nero replied to him as follows: \"Well hast thou done to come hither in  person, that present in my presence thou mayest enjoy my benefits. For  what neither thy father left thee nor thy brothers gave and preserved for  thee, this do I grant thee. King of Armenia I now declare thee, that both  thou and they may understand that I have power to take away kingdoms and  to bestow them.\" At the end of these words he bade him come up the  inclined plane built for this very purpose in front of the rostra, and  Tiridates having been made to sit beneath his feet he placed the diadem  upon his head. At this there was no end of shouts of all sorts.  [Sidenote:--6--] According to decree there also took place a celebration  in the theatre. Not merely the stage but the whole interior of the theatre  round about had been gilded, and all properties brought in had been  adorned with gold, so that people came to refer to the very day as  \"golden.\" The curtains stretched across the sky-opening to keep off the  sun were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#9)"],[1,", \"Minnehaha and I  jumped up on the logs, and we climbed up as high as we could, and I took up  a stick, and then I stood up with Minnehaha behind me, and I shook the  stick at them, and--and I shouted:    \"'A wus, atimuk!'\" (Get away, you dogs!)    \"They came so near on the logs that I hit one or two of them, while all of  the others on the ground kept barking at us. But I kept shouting back at  them, 'A wus, atimuk!' My! it was great fun. Then all at once we heard Jack  and Cuffy, and, I tell you! soon there was more fun, when our big dogs  sprang at them. Every time an Eskimo was tackled by Jack or Cuffy he went  down, and was soon howling from the way in which he was shaken. And they  had nearly thrashed the whole of them when papa and Kennedy came rushing  up. I wished they had been there sooner, to have seen all the fun.\"    Thus the lad's tongue rattled on, while it was evident he was utterly  unconscious of the danger they had been in.    After some deliberation it was decided that, in view of this runaway being  the first offense of the kind, the punishment should be confinement to  their own room the next day, until six o'clock in the evening, on a diet of  bread and water. At this Mary was simply furious. She well knew, however,  that it was necessary for her to control herself in her master's and  mistress's presence. She managed to hold her tongue, but her flashing eyes  and an occasional mutter, which would come out as she went about her usual  duties, showed the smoldering fire that was burning inside. The children  had been duly lectured for their breach of discipline and then, that  evening, consigned to their room for their imprisonment which was to last  until the next evening. That night Mary took up her mattress and blankets  and went and slept on the floor between the two beds of the children, and  in spite of orders, so the maid said, she secretly carried up a goodly  sized bundle from the kitchen.    The day was one of unusual quietness, as the lively pair, who generally  kept the house full of music, were now supposed to be away in humiliation  and disgrace. All regretted that the punishment had to be inflicted and the  children made to realize their naughtiness in thus running away, and all  were looking forward to the hour of six o'clock with pleasant anticipation.  When it arrived word was sent to the children that their hours of  imprisonment were over, and that they were to present themselves in the  library. Quick and prompt was the response, and noisily and hurriedly the  two darlings came rushing down the stairs, followed by Mary. They were  arrayed in their most beautiful apparel, and were evidently prepared by  their nurse to go with her for a walk.    The father, feeling that it was necessary, began to make a few remarks  expressive of regret that he had thus been obliged to punish them, when he  was interrupted by little Sagastao with the honest and candid remark,  spoken in a way which, while perfectly fearless, was yet devoid of all  rudeness or impertinence:    \"O, father dear, you needn't feel badly about us at all, as Mary has been  with us all day and has told us lovely stories.\"    \"And Mary brought us taffy candy,\" broke in darling Minnehaha, with equal  candor; \"and some currant cakes and other nice things, so we got on very  well after all.\"    These candid utterances on the part of the two children not only amazed but  amused the parents, and were another revelation of Mary's wonderful love  for the children and her defiance of disciplinary measures which she  thought might cause the slightest pain or sorrow. And here she stood in the  open door, and as soon as their father's words and their own rather  startling \"confessions\" were ended she called them to her and away they  went for a long walk along the beautiful shore of the lake, leaving their  parents to conjecture whether the punishment that had been inflicted would  produce any very salutary results.    When the children were gathered that evening in the study with their  parents little Sagastao said:    \"Papa, Minnehaha and I have been talking it all over with Mary and she has  shown us that it was naughty on our parts to run away as we did; and we are  sorry that we did anything that caused you and mamma sorrow and anxiety  about us, and so, ... Well, we know you will forgive us.\" And as the four  little arms went twining around the parents' necks there was joy and  gladness all round, and it was evident that there was no danger of the  escapade being repeated.    The following are a couple of the legends that Mary told them while they  were prisoners in their own room that day.      THE LEGEND OF THE SWALLOWS.    \"Long ago,\" said Mary, \"there were some Indian families who lived on the  top of a very high hill, like a mountain. They had quite a number of small  children, and I am sorry to say they were very naughty and would often  disobey their parents. One of their bad deeds was to run away, and thus  make the father and mother very unhappy until they returned. Their parents  were very much afraid that some of the Windegoos or wild animals would  catch them when they thus ran away by themselves, with no strong man to  guard them.    \"So the parents tried to make their homes as nice as possible for them.  They made all sorts of toys for them and gave them nice little bows and  arrows, and other things, that ought to have amused them and kept them  happy at home. All the efforts of their parents, however, were of no use.  They soon were tired of their home amusements, and when their parents'  backs were turned they would run away.    \"At length their conduct became so bad, and the parents found themselves so  powerless to prevent it, that they decided to appeal to the Indian Council  for assistance. For a time the stern commands of the Chief were listened to  and obeyed. Then they neglected his words, and about as frequently as ever  they were found playing truant from their homes and parents.    \"At length, on one occasion when they had all run away and had been off for  several days and could not be found, their fathers and mothers called upon  Wakonda to look for them and to send them home. Wakonda was very angry when  he heard about these naughty children running away so much, and so he set  off in a hurry to find them. After a long search he discovered them on the  bank of a muddy river making mud huts and mud animals. He was so angry at  them that he at once turned them into swallows, and said, 'From this time  forward you will ever be wanderers and your homes will always be made of  mud,' and so it has been.\"    \"I say, Mary, did you remember that yarn because Minnehaha and I ran away?\"  said Sagastao.    \"Well, we were not making mud huts,\" said Minnehaha.    Mary was not to be caught, however, even if she did love them so much, and  she did not answer Sagastao's question, although in her heart she was not  sorry if he saw something in the legend that would deter him from again  running away.      HOW SOME CRUEL MEN WERE PUNISHED WHO TEASED AN ORPHAN BOY.    \"There was once an old grandmother who was left alone with only an orphan  grandson. All of her other relatives were dead. This boy was a very  industrious little fellow, and did all that he could to help his  grandmother. They both had to work very hard to have sufficient to keep  them from starving. Together they would go out in their canoe and catch  fish. They also set many snares in the forest to catch rabbits, partridges,  and other small game.    \"Because they were so poor the clothing of this orphan boy was made partly  of rabbitskins and partly of the skins of birds. When he was not busy  helping his grandmother he, like other little boys, was pleased to go out  and play with the other children of the village. Some of the men of the  village were very fond of teasing him, and some were even cruel to him,  because of the poor clothing he had to wear. Often the poor boy would  return to the wigwam of his grandmother crying and weeping because the men  of the village had not only teased him on account of his poor clothing but  had almost torn his coat into pieces. His grandmother entreated the men to  stop teasing the poor boy, who could not help his poverty. She would  patiently mend his poor torn clothes and try to cheer him up with the hope  that soon these foolish, cruel men would see how wrong it was to treat him  thus.    \"But they only seemed to get worse instead of better, and so the  grandmother got very angry at last and determined to have it stopped.    \"So she went off to Wakonda and told him all about it. Wakonda was very  busy just then, but he gave her some of his magical powers and told her  what to do when she reached her home.    \"When she arrived there she found her grandson almost naked from the abuse  of the cruel men, who, finding that she was absent, had been more cruel  than ever to him. She then informed him that she was able now to put a stop  to all their cruel actions. So she told him to dive into a pool of water  that was near at hand. He did as she had commanded, and there he found an  underground channel that led out into the great lake.    \"When he came up to the top of the water in the lake he found himself  transformed into a beautiful seal. He at once begun playing about in the  waves as seals are often seen doing.    \"It was not long before he was seen by the people of the village, and, of  course, the men were very anxious to secure this valuable seal. Canoes were  quickly launched and away the men paddled with their spears to try and  capture it. But the boy, now transformed into the seal, quickly swam away  from them, as instructed by his grandmother, and so kept them busy paddling  on and on farther from the shore. When they seemed almost discouraged the  seal would suddenly dive down, and then reappear in the water just behind  them. Then, before the men could turn around and spear him, he as"]]]
