And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and  wept.    01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God  called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee,  Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.    01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I  will make him a great nation.    01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she  went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.    01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the  wilderness, and became an archer.    01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took  him a wife out of the land of Egypt.    01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol  the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with  thee in all that thou doest:    01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not  deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but  according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto  me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.    01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.    01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,  which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.    01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;  neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.    01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto  Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.    01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.    01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe  lambs which thou hast set by themselves?    01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my  hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.    01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they  sware both of them.    01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose  up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into  the land of the Philistines.    01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on  the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.    01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.    01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt  Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.    01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom  thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there  for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee  of.    01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his  ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and  clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the  place of which God had told him.    01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the  place afar off.    01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the  ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to  you.    01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it  upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and  they went both of them together.    01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:  and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the  wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?    01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for  a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.    01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and  Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound  Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.    01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to  slay his son.    01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and  said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.    01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou  any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou  hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.    01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind  him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took  the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his  son.    01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it  is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.    01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven  the second time,    01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because  thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only  son:    01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will  multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is  upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;    01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be  blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.    01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and  went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.    01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told  Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy  brother Nahor;    01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father  of Aram,    01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.    01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to  Nahor, Abraham's brother.    01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also  Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.    01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:  these were the years of the life of Sarah.    01:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8001"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 1: Genesis (#8)"],[1,"it for ten's sake.    01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing             with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.    01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the             gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and             he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;    01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into             your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,             and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they             said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.    01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,             and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did             bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.    01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of             Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the             people from every quarter:    01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men             which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that             we may know them.    01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door             after him,    01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.    01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let             me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as             is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for             therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.    01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one             fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now             will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed             sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.    01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the             house to them, and shut to the door.    01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with             blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied             themselves to find the door.    01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in             law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast             in the city, bring them out of this place:    01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is             waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath             sent us to destroy it.    01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which             married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this             place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as             one that mocked unto his sons in law.    01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,             saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are             here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.    01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and             upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two             daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought             him forth, and set him without the city.    01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,             that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,             neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,             lest thou be consumed.    01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:    01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and             thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me             in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest             some evil take me, and I die:    01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little             one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and             my soul shall live.    01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning             this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the             which thou hast spoken.    01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou             be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called             Zoar.    01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.    01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone             and fire from the LORD out of heaven;    01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the             inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the             ground.    01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a             pillar of salt.    01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he             stood before the LORD:    01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the             land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the             country went up as the smoke of a furnace.    01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the             plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the             midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the             which Lot dwelt.    01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and             his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:             and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.    01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,             and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after             the manner of all the earth:    01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with             him, that we may preserve seed of our father.    01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the             firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived             not when she lay down, nor when she arose.    01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said             unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:             let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,             and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.    01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the             younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she             lay down, nor when she arose.    01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their             father.    01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the             same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.    01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name             Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto             this day.    01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,             and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.    01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and             Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.    01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to             him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou             hast taken; for she is a man's wife.    01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt             thou slay also a righteous nation?    01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she             herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart             and innocency of my hands have I done this.    01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst             this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee             from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to             touch her.    01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,             and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou             restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,             and all that are thine.    01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all             his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the             men were sore afraid.    01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast             thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou             hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast             done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.    01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou             hast done this thing?    01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is             not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.    01:020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my             father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my             wife.    01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my             father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness             which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall             come, say of me, He is my brother.    01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and             womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him             Sarah his wife.    01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell             where it pleaseth thee.    01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a             thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a"]]]
