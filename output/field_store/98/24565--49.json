Build sentences, employing the following phrases as modifiers.    To Europe, of oak, from Albany, at the station, through the fields, for  vacation, among the Indians, of the United States.    Supply to the following predicates subjects modified by phrases.    ---- is situated on the Thames.  ---- has arrived.  ---- was destroyed by an earthquake.  ---- was received.  ---- has just been completed.  ---- may be enjoyed.    Supply to the following subjects predicates modified by phrases.    Iron ----.  The trees ----.  Squirrels ----.  The Bible ----.  Sugar ----.  Cheese ----.  Paul ----.  Strawberries ----.  The mountain ----.    Write five sentences, each of which shall contain one or more phrases used  as modifiers.          LESSON 33.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Re-write the following sentences, changing the italicized words into  equivalent phrases.    +Model+.--A _golden_ image was made.     An image _of gold_ was made.    You will notice that the adjective _golden_ was placed before the subject,  but, when changed to a phrase, it followed the subject.    1. The book was _carefully_ read.  2. The old soldiers fought _courageously_.  3. A group of children were strolling _homeward_.  4. No season of life should be spent _idly_.  5. The _English_ ambassador has just arrived.  6. That _generous_ act was liberally rewarded.    Change the following adjectives and adverbs into equivalent phrases, and  employ the phrases in sentences of your own building.

PREPOSITIONS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--In the preceding Lessons, the little words  that were placed before nouns, thus forming phrases, belong to a, class of  words called +Prepositions+. You noticed that these words, which you have  now learned to call prepositions, served to introduce phrases. The  preposition shows the relation of the _idea_ expressed by the principal  word of the phrase to that of the word which the phrase modifies. It serves  also to connect these words.    In the sentence, _The squirrel ran up a tree_, what word shows the relation  of the act of running, to the tree? Ans. _Up_.    Other words may be used to express different relations. Repeat, nine times,  the sentence above given, supplying, in the place of _up_, each of the  following prepositions: _Around, behind, down, into, over, through, to,  under, from_.    Let this exercise be continued, using such sentences as, _The man went into  the house; The ship sailed toward the bay_.      +DEFINITION.--A _Preposition_ is a word that introduces a phrase modifier,  and shows the relation, in sense, of its principal word to the word  modified+.    +Analysis and Parsing+.    +Model+.--_Flowers preach to us_.    For +Analysis+ and +Diagram+, see Lesson 31.    For +Written Parsing+, see Lesson 22. Add the needed columns.    +Oral Parsing+.--_Flowers_ is a noun, because----; _preach_ is a verb,  because----; _to_ is a _preposition_, because it shows the relation, in  sense, between _us_ and _preach;_ _us_ is a pronoun, because it is used  instead of the name of the speaker and the names of those for whom he  speaks.    1. The golden lines of sunset glow.  2. A smiling landscape lay before us.  3. Columbus was born at Genoa.  4. The forces of Hannibal were routed by Scipio.  5. The capital of New York is on the Hudson.  6. The ships sail over the boisterous sea.  7. All names of the Deity should begin with capital letters.  8. Air is composed chiefly of two invisible gases.  9. The greater portion of South America lies between the tropics.  10. The laurels of the warrior must at all times be dyed in blood.  11. The first word of every entire sentence should begin with a capital      letter.  12. The subject of a sentence is generally placed before the predicate.    Impromptu Exercise.    (The teacher may find it profitable to make a separate lesson of this  exercise.)    Let the teacher write on the board a subject and a predicate that will  admit of many modifiers. The pupils are to expand the sentence into as many  separate sentences as possible, each containing one apt phrase modifier.  The competition is to see who can build the most and the best sentences in  a given time. The teacher gathers up the slates and reads the work aloud,  or has the pupils exchange slates and read it themselves.          LESSON 35.    COMPOUND SUBJECT AND COMPOUND PREDICATE.    When two or more subjects united by a connecting word have the same  predicate, they form a +_Compound Subject;_+ and, when two or more  predicates connected in like manner have the same subject, they form a  +_Compound Predicate_+.    In the sentence, _Birds and bees can fly_, the two words _birds_ and  _bees_, connected by _and_, have the same predicate; the same action is  asserted of both birds and bees. In the sentence, _Leaves fade and fall_,  two assertions are made of the same things. In the first sentence, _birds_  and _bees_ form the _compound subject_; and, in the second, _fade_ and  _fall_ form the _compound predicate_.    Analyze and parse the following sentences.    +Models+.--_Napoleon rose, reigned, and fell_.    _Frogs, antelopes, and kangaroos can jump_.                      rose            Frogs                ,=,=====            ======.=.               /  '                       '  \\  Napoleon|   / X ' reigned     antelopes ' X \\   | can jump  ========|==|    '========     =========='    |==|=========          |   \\and'                       'and/   |               \\  ' fell        kangaroos '  /                `-'======       =========='='    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--The short line following the subject line  represents the entire predicate, and is supposed to be continued in the  three horizontal lines that follow, each of which represents one of the  parts of the _compound predicate_. These three lines are united by dotted  lines, which stand for the connecting words. The +X+ denotes that an _and_  is understood.    Study this explanation carefully, and you will understand the other  diagram.    +Oral Analysis+ of the first sentence.    This is a sentence, because ----; _Napoleon_ is the subject, because ----;  _rose_, _reigned_, and _fell_ form the _compound predicate_, because they  belong in common to the same subject, and say something about Napoleon.  _And_ connects _reigned_ and _fell_.    1. The Rhine and the Rhone rise in Switzerland.  2. Time and tide wait for no man.  3. Washington and Lafayette fought for American Independence.  4. Wild birds shrieked, and fluttered on the ground.  5. The mob raged and roared.  6. The seasons came and went.  7. Pride, poverty, and fashion cannot live in the same house.  8. The tables of stone were cast to the ground and broken.  9. Silver or gold will be received in payment.  10. Days, months, years, and ages will circle away.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    What is a phrase?

The words _and_ and _or_, used in the preceding Lesson to connect the nouns  and the verbs, belong to a class of words called +_Conjunctions_+.    Conjunctions may also connect _words_ used as _modifiers;_ as,    A daring _but_ foolish feat was performed.    They may connect phrases; as,    We shall go to Saratoga _and_ to Niagara.    They may connect _clauses_, that is, expressions that, standing alone,  would be sentences; as,    He must increase, _but_ I must decrease.      +DEFINITION.--A _Conjunction_, is a word used to connect words, phrases, or  clauses+.    The +_Interjection_+ is the eighth and last _part of speech_. Interjections  are mere exclamations, and are without grammatical relation to any other  word in the sentence.      +DEFINITION.--An _Interjection_ is a word used to express strong or sudden  feeling+.    Examples:--    Bravo! hurrah! pish! hush! ha, ha! alas! hail! lo! pshaw!    Analyze and parse the following sentences.    +Model+.--_Hurrah! that cool and fearless fireman has rushed into the house  and up the burning stairs_.

Negroes were employed in this cultivation from its  commencement; and in 1519 representations were made to government, as  in our own time, that the West India Islands would be ruined and made  desert, if slaves were not conveyed thither annually from the coast of  Guinea.    For some years past the culture and preparation of sugar has been much  improved in Terra Firma; and, as the process of refining is prohibited  by the laws at Jamaica, they reckon on the fraudulent exportation of  refined sugar to the English colonies. But the consumption of the  provinces of Venezuela, in papelon, and in raw sugar employed in  making chocolate and sweetmeats (dulces) is so enormous, that the  exportation has been hitherto entirely null. The finest plantations of  sugar are in the valleys of Aragua and of the Tuy, near Pao de Zarate,  between La Victoria and San Sebastian, near Guatire, Guarenas, and  Caurimare. The first canes arrived in the New World from the Canary  Islands; and even now Canarians, or Islenos, are placed at the head of  most of the great plantations, and superintend the labours of  cultivation and refining.    It is this connexion between the Canarians and the inhabitants of  Venezuela, that has given rise to the introduction of camels into  those provinces. The Marquis del Toro caused three to be brought from  Lancerote. The expense of conveyance was very considerable, owing to  the space which these animals occupy on board merchant-vessels, and  the great quantity of water they require during a long sea-voyage. A  camel, bought for thirty piastres, costs between eight and nine  hundred before it reaches the coast of Caracas. We saw four of these  animals at Mocundo; three of which had been bred in America. Two  others had died of the bite of the coral, a venomous serpent very  common on the banks of the lake. These camels have hitherto been  employed only in the conveyance of the sugarcanes to the mill. The  males, stronger than the females, carry from forty to fifty arrobas. A  wealthy landholder in the province of Varinas, encouraged by the  example of the Marquis del Toro, has allotted a sum of 15,000 piastres  for the purpose of bringing fourteen or fifteen camels at once from  the Canary Islands. It is presumed these beasts of burden may be  employed in the conveyance of merchandise across the burning plains of  Casanare, from the Apure and Calabozo, which in the season of drought  resemble the deserts of Africa. How advantageous it would have been  had the Conquistadores, from the beginning of the sixteenth century,  peopled America with camels, as they have peopled it with horned  cattle, horses, and mules. Wherever there are immense distances to  cross in uninhabited lands; wherever the construction of canals  becomes difficult (as in the isthmus of Panama, on the table-land of  Mexico, and in the deserts that separate the kingdom of Quito from  Peru, and Peru from Chile), camels would be of the highest importance,  to facilitate inland commerce. It seems the more surprising, that  their introduction was not encouraged by the government at the  beginning of the conquest, as, long after the taking of Grenada,  camels, for which the Moors had a great predilection, were still very  common in the south of Spain. A Biscayan, Juan de Reinaga, carried  some of these animals at his own expense to Peru. Father Acosta saw  them at the foot of the Andes, about the end of the sixteenth century;  but little care being taken of them, they scarcely ever bred, and the  race soon became extinct. In those times of oppression and cruelty,  which have been described as the era of Spanish glory, the  commendatories (encomenderos) let out the Indians to travellers like  beasts of burden. They were assembled by hundreds, either to carry  merchandise across the Cordilleras, or to follow the armies in their  expeditions of discovery and pillage. The Indians endured this service  more patiently, because, owing to the almost total want of domestic  animals, they had long been constrained to perform it, though in a  less inhuman manner, under the government of their own chiefs. The  introduction of camels attempted by Juan de Reinaga spread an alarm  among the encomenderos, who were, not by law, but in fact, lords of  the Indian villages. The court listened to the complaints of the  encomenderos; and in consequence America was deprived of one of the  means which would have most facilitated inland communication, and the  exchange of productions. Now, however, there is no reason why the  introduction of camels should not be attempted as a general measure.  Some hundreds of these useful animals, spread over the vast surface of  America, in hot and barren places, would in a few years have a  powerful influence on the public prosperity. Provinces separated by  steppes would then appear to be brought nearer to each other; several  kinds of inland merchandize would diminish in price on the coast; and  by increasing the number of camels, above all the species called  hedjin, or the ship of the desert, a new life would be given to the  industry and commerce of the New World.    On the evening of the 22nd we continued our journey from Mocundo by  Los Guayos to the city of Nueva Valencia. We passed a little forest of  palm-trees, which resembled, by their appearance, and their leaves  spread like a fan, the Chamaerops humilis of the coast of Barbary. The  trunk, however, rises to twenty-four and sometimes thirty feet high.  It is probably a new species of the genus corypha; and is called in  the country palma de sombrero, the footstalks of the leaves being  employed in weaving hats resembling our straw hats. This grove of  palm-trees, the withered foliage of which rustles at the least breath  of air--the camels feeding in the plain--the undulating motion of the  vapours on a soil scorched by the ardour of the sun, give the  landscape an African aspect. The aridity of the land augments as the  traveller approaches the town, after passing the western extremity of  the lake. It is a clayey soil, which has been levelled and abandoned  by the waters. The neighbouring hills, called Los Morros de Valencia,  are composed of white tufa, a very recent limestone formation,  immediately covering the gneiss. It is again found at Victoria, and on  several other points along the chain of the coast. The whiteness of  this tufa, which reflects the rays of the sun, contributes greatly to  the excessive heat felt in this place. Everything seems smitten with  sterility; scarcely are a few plants of cacao found on the banks of  the Rio de Valencia; the rest of the plain is bare, and destitute of  vegetation. This appearance of sterility is here attributed, as it is  everywhere in the valleys of Aragua, to the cultivation of indigo;  which, according to the planters, is, of all plants, that which most  exhausts (cansa) the ground. The real physical causes of this  phenomenon would be an interesting inquiry, since, like the effects of  fallowing land, and of a rotation of crops, it is far from being  sufficiently understood. I shall only observe in general, that the  complaints of the increasing sterility of cultivated land become more  frequent between the tropics, in proportion as they are near the  period of their first breaking-up. In a region almost destitute of  herbs, where every plant has a ligneous stem, and tends to raise  itself as a shrub, the virgin soil remains shaded either by great  trees, or by bushes; and under this tufted shade it preserves  everywhere coolness and humidity. However active the vegetation of the  tropics may appear, the number of roots that penetrate into the earth,  is not so great in an uncultivated soil; while the plants are nearer  to each other in lands subjected to cultivation, and covered with  indigo, sugar-canes, or cassava. The trees and shrubs, loaded with  branches and leaves, draw a great part of their nourishment from the  ambient air; and the virgin soil augments its fertility by the  decomposition of the vegetable substances which progressively  accumulate. It is not so in the fields covered with indigo, or other  herbaceous plants; where the rays of the sun penetrate freely into the  earth, and by the accelerated combustion of the hydrurets of carbon  and other acidifiable principles, destroy the germs of fecundity.  These effects strike the imagination of the planters the more  forcibly, as in lands newly inhabited they compare the fertility of a  soil which has been abandoned to itself during thousands of years,  with the produce of ploughed fields. The Spanish colonies on the  continent, and the great islands of Porto-Rico and Cuba, possess  remarkable advantages with respect to the produce of agriculture over  the lesser West India islands. The former, from their extent, the  variety of their scenery, and their small relative population, still  bear all the characters of a new soil; while at Barbadoes, Tobago, St.  Lucia, the Virgin Islands, and the French part of St. Domingo, it may  be perceived that long cultivation has begun to exhaust the soil. If  in the valleys of Aragua, instead of abandoning the indigo grounds,  and leaving them fallow, they were covered during several years, not  with corn, but with other alimentary plants and forage; if among these  plants such as belong to different families were preferred, and which  shade the soil by their large leaves, the amelioration of the fields  would be gradually accomplished, and they would be restored to a part  of their former fertility.    The city of Nueva Valencia occupies a considerable extent of ground,  but its population scarcely amounts to six or seven thousand souls.  The streets are very broad, the market place, (plaza"]]]
