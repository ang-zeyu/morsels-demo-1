Neither pleadings nor tears softened his  hard heart, and Capinangan was carried down to the sea and thrown in.          Time passed by; Somacuel each day grew sadder and gloomier. He would  have been willing now to forgive his wife, but it was too late.    He said to his slaves: \"Prepare a banca for me, that I may sail from  place to place to amuse myself.\"    So one pleasant morning a banca sailed from Sinaragan, going  southward. Somacuel did not intend to go to any definite place,  but drifted at the mercy of wind and current. He amused himself by  singing during the voyage.    One day the crew descried land at a distance. \"Sir,\" they said,  \"that land is Cagayan. Let us go there to get oysters and crane's  eggs.\" To this their master agreed, and upon anchoring off the coast  he prepared to visit the place.    Oh, what astonishment he felt, as he saw, peeping out of the window of  a house, a woman whose appearance resembled in great measure that of  Capinangan! He would have run to embrace her, had he not remembered  that Capinangan was dead. He was informed that the woman was named  Aloyan. He began to pay court to her, and in a few weeks she became  his wife.    Somacuel was happy, for his wife was very affectionate. Aloyan,  on her part, did not doubt that her husband loved her sincerely,  so she said to him:--    \"My dear Somacuel, I will no longer deceive you. I am the very woman  whom you caused to be thrown into the sea. I am Capinangan. I clung  to a log in the water and was carried to this place, where I have  lived ever since.\"    \"Oh,\" said Somacuel, \"pardon me for the harshness with which I meant  to punish you.\"    \"Let us forget what is passed,\" said Capinangan. \"I deserved it,  after all.\"    So they returned to Sinaragan, where they lived together happily for  many years.      CHAPTER 12    Magboloto.    There was once a man named Magboloto who lived in the depths of the  mountains. One day on going down to a brook he saw three goddesses  bathing in the water. They had left their wings on the bank, and  Magboloto managed to slip down and steal one pair of them. When the  goddesses had finished bathing and looked for their wings, they could  not find those belonging to the youngest, Macaya. At last the two  goddesses put on their wings and flew up to heaven, leaving behind  them Macaya, who wept bitterly, since without her wings she could  not go home. Then Magboloto, feigning to have come from a distance,  met her and asked: \"Why do you weep, lady?\"    \"Why do you ask, if you will not help me in my trouble?\" answered  Macaya.    \"I will do my best to help you,\" said Magboloto, \"if you will tell  me about it.\"    So Macaya told him that she had lost her wings, and therefore could  not return to her home in heaven.    \"I am sorry not to be able to help you out of your trouble,\" said  Magboloto, \"but we terrestrial people do not use wings, nor know  where to get them. The only thing I can do for you is to offer you  a home with me.\" Macaya was obliged to accept his offer, since there  was nothing else for her to do.    About a year after Macaya became Magboloto's wife they had a child. One  day, as Magboloto was making rice soup on the hearth, Macaya was  swinging the child in a hammock. Accidentally, she noticed a bundle  stuck into one of the bamboo posts in the partition. She withdrew the  bundle, and upon unrolling it found, oh, joy! her long-lost wings,  which Magboloto had hidden in the hollow bamboo. She at once put  them on, and leaving her husband and child, flew up to join her  celestial family.    Magboloto, on missing his wife, began calling loudly for her. As he  could not find her, he looked for the wings, and seeing that they  were gone, knew at once what had happened. He began to weep bitterly,  especially as he did not know how to take care of the child. So leaving  it in the care of a relative, he set out to find the way to heaven. He  had walked a great distance when he met North Wind. \"Magboloto,  Magboloto, why are you weeping?\" asked North Wind.    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" answered Magboloto.    \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" said North Wind. \"Well,\"  replied Magboloto, \"I have a wife who came from heaven. But now she  has flown away, leaving a little child for me to take care of, and  I am in great sorrow. Please show me the way that leads to her home.\"    \"Magboloto,\" said North Wind, \"I do not know the way, but my brother,  East Wind, can tell you. Good-by.\"    Magboloto went on his way, and after a while he met East  Wind. \"Magboloto, Magboloto, why are you weeping?\" asked East Wind.    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" said Magboloto.    \"Tell me all your trouble and I will help you,\" answered East Wind.    Then Magboloto related all his sorrow, just as he had done to North  Wind.    \"Well,\" said East Wind, \"I do not know the way, but my brother,  South Wind, may be able to show it to you. Good-by.\"    Magboloto went on, and at last met South Wind.    \"Magboloto, Magboloto, why are you weeping?\" asked South Wind.    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" said Magboloto.    \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" answered South Wind.    Then Magboloto told him his story, just as he had done to North Wind  and East Wind.    \"Well,\" said South Wind, \"I do not know the way to heaven, but  my brother, West Wind, can tell you the course to be taken to get  there. Good-by.\"    Magboloto went on and on, and at last met West Wind. \"Magboloto,  Magboloto, why are you weeping?\" asked West Wind.    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" answered Magboloto.    \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" answered West Wind,  and Magboloto did as he was bidden.    \"Magboloto,\" said West Wind, \"I don't know the way to heaven, but my  friend, Mr. Eagle, does. Good-by.\"    Magboloto went on until he met Mr. Eagle.    \"Magboloto, Magboloto, why are you weeping?\" asked Mr. Eagle.    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" answered Magboloto.    \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" replied Mr. Eagle. Then  Magboloto told Mr. Eagle his trouble.    \"Magboloto,\" said Mr. Eagle, \"get upon my back and I will carry you  to your wife's home.\"    Magboloto climbed upon Mr. Eagle's back and they flew up until they  reached Macaya's house. Then Magboloto requested Macaya's grandmother,  with whom she lived, to let her granddaughter return to earth with him.    \"By no means,\" said the grandmother, \"unless you will spread ten  jars of lunga (a certain very small grain) out to dry and gather them  again in the evening.\"    So Magboloto spread the jars of lunga on the sand, and at noon began  to gather them up; but sunset had come before he had gathered more  than five handfuls, so he sat down and began to cry like a little boy.    The king of the ants heard him, and wishing to help him,  asked:--\"Magboloto, Magboloto, why are you weeping?\"    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me.\"    \"Tell me about it and I will help you.\"    So Magboloto told the king of the ants all his history, and the  condition imposed by the grandmother before he could have his wife,  and how impossible it was to fulfil it.    \"Well, Magboloto, you shall be helped,\" said the king of the ants. Then  he blew his horn, and in a little while all his subjects came, and  began picking up the grain and putting it into the jars. In a few  moments all the grain was in the jars.    The next morning Magboloto went to get his wife, but the grandmother  stopped him, saying:--    \"You shall not take my granddaughter away until you have first hulled  a hundred bushels of rice.\"    Magboloto was in despair, for he knew that to hull one hundred  bushels of rice would take him not less than one hundred days, and  the grandmother required him to do it in one day; so he cried like  a child at his misfortune. The king of the rats heard him crying,  and at once came to help him.    \"Magboloto, Magboloto, why are you weeping?\" asked King Rat.    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me.\"    \"Relate the matter, and I will.\"    Magboloto told him his trouble. Then the king of the rats called his  subjects together and ordered them to gnaw the hulls from the rice. In  an instant the rice was all hulled.    The next morning Magboloto made ready to depart with his wife, but  the grandmother stopped him again, saying:--    \"You may not go until you have chopped down all the trees you see on  that mountain over there.\"    There were more than a million trees, so Magboloto was in great  trouble, and as usual he began to weep.    The king of the wild boars heard him and came up, saying:--    \"Magboloto, Magboloto, why are you weeping?\"    \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me.\"    \"Relate the matter, and I will.\"    Magboloto related all that had happened to him. Then the king of  the wild boars called all his subjects together and set them at work  cutting down the trees with their tusks. In a few minutes the trees  were all down.    When the grandmother saw that Magboloto accomplished every task she  gave him to do she became tired of trying to think of things for  him to do; so she allowed him to depart with Macaya, and leaving the  celestial abode they descended to their home on the earth, where they  lived happily together for many years.      CHAPTER 13    Why Dogs Wag Their Tails.    Once upon a time there lived in a certain pueblo a rich man who  had a dog and a cat. His only daughter, of whom he was very fond,  was studying in a convent in a city several miles distant and it was  his custom, about once a week, to send the dog and cat to take her  a little present. The dog was so old that he had lost all his teeth,  and so was unable to fight, but the cat was strong and very cunning,  and so one could help the other, since the dog knew better how to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#9)"],[1,"literally, \"it is about to  grow white,\" that is, to become light, to dawn. _Ataensic_ is from the  root _aouen_, water, and means literally, \"she who is in the water.\"[1]  Plainly expressed, the sense of the story is that the orb of light rises  daily out of the boundless waters which are supposed to surround the land,  preceded by the dawn, which fades away as soon as the sun has risen. Each  day the sun disappears in these waters, to rise again from them the  succeeding morning. As the approach of the sun causes the dawn, it was  merely a gross way of stating this to say that the solar god was the  father of his own mother, the husband of his grandmother.    [Footnote 1: I have analyzed these words in a note to another work, and  need not repeat the matter here, the less so, as I am not aware that the  etymology has been questioned. See _Myths of the New World_, 2d Ed., p.  183, note.]    The position of Ioskeha in mythology is also shown by the other name under  which he was, perhaps, even more familiar to most of the Iroquois. This is  _Tharonhiawakon_, which is also a verbal form of the third person, with  the dual sign, and literally means, \"He holds (or holds up) the sky with  his two arms.\"[1] In other words, he is nearly allied to the ancient Aryan  Dyaus, the Sky, the Heavens, especially the Sky in the daytime.    [Footnote 1: A careful analysis of this name is given by Father J.A. Cuoq,  probably the best living authority on the Iroquois, in his _Lexique de la  Langue Iroquoise_, p. 180 (Montreal, 1882). Here also the Iroquois  followed precisely the line of thought of the ancient Egyptians. Shu, in  the religion of Heliopolis, represented the cosmic light and warmth, the  quickening, creative principle. It is he who, as it is stated in the  inscriptions, \"holds up the heavens,\" and he is depicted on the monuments  as a man with uplifted arms who supports the vault of heaven, because it  is the intermediate light that separates the earth from the sky. Shu was  also god of the winds; in a passage of the Book of the Dead, he is made to  say: \"I am Shu, who drives the winds onward to the confines of heaven, to  the confines of the earth, even to the confines of space.\" Again, like  Ioskeha, Shu is said to have begotten himself in the womb of his mother,  Nu or Nun, who was, like Ataensic, the goddess of water, the heavenly  ocean, the primal sea. Tiele, _History of the Egyptian Religion_, pp.  84-86.]    The signification of the conflict with his twin brother is also clearly  seen in the two names which the latter likewise bears in the legends. One  of these is that which I have given, _Tawiscara_, which, there is little  doubt, is allied to the root, _tiokaras_, it grows dark. The other is  _Tehotennhiaron_, the root word of which is _kannhia_, the flint stone.  This name he received because, in his battle with his brother, the drops  of blood which fell from his wounds were changed into flints.[1] Here the  flint had the same meaning which I have already pointed out in Algonkin  myth, and we find, therefore, an absolute identity of mythological  conception and symbolism between the two nations.    [Footnote 1: Cuoq, _Lexique de la Langue Iroquoise_, p. 180, who gives a  full analysis of the name.]    Could these myths have been historically identical? It is hard to  disbelieve it. Yet the nations were bitter enemies. Their languages are  totally unlike. These same similarities present themselves over such wide  areas and between nations so remote and of such different culture, that  the theory of a parallelism of development is after all the more credible  explanation.    The impressions which natural occurrences make on minds of equal stages of  culture are very much alike. The same thoughts are evoked, and the same  expressions suggest themselves as appropriate to convey these thoughts in  spoken language. This is often exhibited in the identity of expression  between master-poets of the same generation, and between cotemporaneous  thinkers in all branches of knowledge. Still more likely is it to occur in  primitive and uncultivated conditions, where the most obvious forms of  expression are at once adopted, and the resources of the mind are  necessarily limited. This is a simple and reasonable explanation for the  remarkable sameness which prevails in the mental products of the lower  stages of civilization, and does away with the necessity of supposing a  historic derivation one from the other or both from a common stock.

I now turn from the wild hunting tribes who peopled the shores of the  Great Lakes and the fastnesses of the northern forests to that cultivated  race whose capital city was in the Valley of Mexico, and whose scattered  colonies were found on the shores of both oceans from the mouths of the  Rio Grande and the Gila, south, almost to the Isthmus of Panama. They are  familiarly known as Aztecs or Mexicans, and the language common to them  all was the _Nahuatl_, a word of their own, meaning \"the pleasant  sounding.\"    Their mythology has been preserved in greater fullness than that of any  other American people, and for this reason I am enabled to set forth in  ampler detail the elements of their hero-myth, which, indeed, may be taken  as the most perfect type of those I have collected in this volume.        Sec.1. _The Two Antagonists._    The culture hero of the Aztecs was Quetzalcoatl, and the leading drama,  the central myth, in all the extensive and intricate theology of the  Nahuatl speaking tribes was his long contest with Tezcatlipoca, \"a  contest,\" observes an eminent Mexican antiquary, \"which came to be the  main element in the Nahuatl religion and the cause of its modifications,  and which materially influenced the destinies of that race from its  earliest epochs to the time of its destruction.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Alfredo Chavero, _La Piedra del Sol_, in the _Anales del  Museo Nacional de Mexico_, Tom. II, p. 247.]    The explanations which have been offered of this struggle have varied with  the theories of the writers propounding them. It has been regarded as a  simple historical fact; as a figure of speech to represent the struggle  for supremacy between two races; as an astronomical statement referring to  the relative positions of the planet Venus and the Moon; as a conflict  between Christianity, introduced by Saint Thomas, and the native  heathenism; and as having other meanings not less unsatisfactory or  absurd.    Placing it side by side with other American hero-myths, we shall see that  it presents essentially the same traits, and undoubtedly must be explained  in the same manner. All of them are the transparent stories of a simple  people, to express in intelligible terms the daily struggle that is ever  going on between Day and Night, between Light and Darkness, between Storm  and Sunshine.    Like all the heroes of light, Quetzalcoatl is identified with the East. He  is born there, and arrives from there, and hence Las Casas and others  speak of him as from Yucatan, or as landing on the shores of the Mexican  Gulf from some unknown land. His day of birth was that called Ce Acatl,  One Reed, and by this name he is often known. But this sign is that of the  East in Aztec symbolism.[1] In a myth of the formation of the sun and  moon, presented by Sahagun,[2] a voluntary victim springs into the  sacrificial fire that the gods have built. They know that he will rise as  the sun, but they do not know in what part of the horizon that will be.  Some look one way, some another, but Quetzalcoatl watches steadily the  East, and is the first to see and welcome the Orb of Light. He is fair in  complexion, with abundant hair and a full beard, bordering on the red,[3]  as are all the dawn heroes, and like them he was an instructor in the  arts, and favored peace and mild laws.
