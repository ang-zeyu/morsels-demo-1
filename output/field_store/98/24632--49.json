But the strange thing  av ut was the quiet that lay upon. 'Twas like a fight in a drame--except  for thim that was dead.    \"Whin I gave room to the Oirishman I was expinded an' forlorn in my  inside.

Of course wives had to have seats of equal importance  with those of their husbands, and each widow retained the dignity  apportioned to her in her husband's lifetime. We can well believe that much  \"discresing\" was necessary in dignifying as well as in seating. Often,  after building a new meeting-house with all the painstaking and thoughtful  judgment that could be shown, the dissensions over the seating lasted for  years. The conciliatory fashion of \"dignifying the seats\" clung long in the  Congregational churches of New England. In East Hartford and Windsor it was  not abandoned until 1824.    Many men were unwilling to serve on these seating committees, and refused  to \"medle with the seating,\" protesting against it on account of the odium  that was incurred, but they were seldom \"let off.\" Even so influential and  upright a man as Judge Sewall felt a dread of the responsibility and of  the personal spleen he might arouse. He also feared in one case lest his  seat-decisions might, if disliked, work against the ministerial peace of  his son, who had been recently ordained as pastor of the church. Sometimes  the difficulty was settled in this way: the entire church (or rather the  male members) voted who should occupy the foreseat, or the highest pew, and  the voted-in occupants of this seat of honor formed a committee, who in  turn seated the others of the congregation.    In the town of Rowley, \"age, office, and the amount paid toward building  the meeting-house were considered when assigning seats.\" Other towns had  very amusing and minute rules for seating. Each year of the age counted one  degree. Military service counted eight degrees. The magistrate's office  counted ten degrees. Every forty shillings paid in on the church rate  counted one degree. We can imagine the ambitious Puritan adding up his  degrees, and paying in forty shillings more in order to sit one seat above  his neighbor who was a year or two older.    In Pittsfield, as early as the year 1765, the pews were sold by \"vandoo\"  to the highest bidder, in order to stop the unceasing quarrels over  the seating. In Windham, Connecticut, in 1762, the adoption of this  pacificatory measure only increased the dissension when it was discovered  that some miserable \"bachelors who never paid for more than one head and  a horse\" had bid in several of the best pews in the meeting-house. In New  London, two women, sisters-in-law, were seated side by side. Each claimed  the upper or more dignified seat, and they quarrelled so fiercely over the  occupation of it that they had to be brought before the town meeting.    In no way could honor and respect be shown more satisfactorily in the  community than by the seat assigned in meeting. When Judge Sewall married  his second wife, he writes with much pride: \"Mr. Oliver in the names of the  Overseers invites my Wife to sit in the foreseat. I thought to have brought  her into my pue. I thankt him and the Overseers.\" His wife died in a few  months, and he reproached himself for his pride in this honor, and left the  seat which he had in the men's foreseat. \"God in his holy Sovereignty put  my wife out of the Fore Seat. I apprehended I had Cause to be ashamed of my  Sin and loath myself for it, and retired into my Pue,\" which was of course  less dignified than the foreseat.    Often, in thriving communities, the \"pues\" and benches did not afford  seating room enough for the large number who wished to attend public  worship, and complaints were frequent that many were \"obliged to sit  squeased on the stairs.\" Persons were allowed to bring chairs and stools  into the meeting-house, and place them in the \"alleys.\" These extra seats  became often such encumbering nuisances that in many towns laws were passed  abolishing and excluding them, or, as in Hadley, ordering them \"back of the  women's seats.\" In 1759 it was ordered in that town to \"clear the Alleys of  the meeting-house of chairs and other Incumbrances.\" Where the chairless  people went is not told; perhaps they sat in the doorway, or, in the summer  time, listened outside the windows. One forward citizen of Hardwicke had  gradually moved his chair down the church alley, step by step, Sunday after  Sunday, from one position of dignity to another still higher, until at last  he boldly invaded the deacons' seat. When, in the year 1700, this honored  position was forbidden him, in his chagrin and mortification he committed  suicide by hanging.    The young men sat together in rows, and the young women in corresponding  seats on the other side of the house. In 1677 the selectmen of Newbury  gave permission to a few young women to build a pew in the gallery. It is  impossible to understand why this should have roused the indignation of the  bachelors of the town, but they were excited and angered to such a pitch  that they broke a window, invaded the meeting-house, and \"broke the pue in  pessis.\" For this sacrilegious act they were fined L10 each, and sentenced  to be whipped or pilloried. In consideration, however, of the fact that  many of them had been brave soldiers, the punishment was omitted when they  confessed and asked forgiveness. This episode is very comical; it exhibits  the Puritan youth in such an ungallant and absurd light. When, ten years  later, liberty was given to ten young men, who had sat in the \"foure backer  seats in the gallery,\" to build a pew in \"the hindermost seat in the  gallery behind the pulpit,\" it is not recorded that the Salem young women  made any objection. In the Woburn church, the four daughters of one of the  most respected families in the place received permission to build a pew in  which to sit. Here also such indignant and violent protests were made by  the young men that the selectmen were obliged to revoke the permission.  It would be interesting to know the bachelors' discourteous objections to  young women being allowed to own a pew, but no record of their reasons  is given. Bachelors were so restricted and governed in the colonies that  perhaps they resented the thought of any independence being allowed to  single women. Single men could not live alone, but were forced to reside  with some family to whom the court assigned them, and to do in all respects  just what the court ordered. Thus, in olden times, a man had to marry to  obtain his freedom. The only clue to a knowledge of the cause of the fierce  and resentful objection of New England young men to permitting the young  women of the various congregations to build and own a \"maids pue\" is  contained in the record of the church of the town of Scotland, Connecticut.  \"An Hurlburt, Pashants and Mary Lazelle, Younes Bingham, prudenc Hurlburt  and Jerusha meachem\" were empowered to build a pew \"provided they build  within a year and raise ye pue no higher than the seat is on the Mens  side.\" \"Never ye Less,\" saith the chronicle, \"ye above said have built said  pue much higher than ye order, and if they do not lower the same within one  month from this time the society comitte shall take said pue away.\" Do you  wonder that the bachelors resented this towering \"maids pue?\" that they  would not be scornfully looked down upon every Sabbath by women-folk,  especially by a girl named \"meachem\"? Pashants and Younes and prudenc had  to quickly come down from their unlawfully high church-perch and take a  more humble seat, as befitted them; thus did their \"vaulting ambition  o'erleap itself and fall on the other side.\" Perhaps the Salem maids also  built too high and imposing a pew. In Haverhill, in 1708, young women were  permitted to build pews, provided they did not \"damnify the Stairway.\" This  somewhat profane-sounding restriction they heeded, and the Haverhill maids  occupied their undamnifying \"pue\" unmolested. Medford young women, however,  in 1701, when allowed only one side gallery for seats, while the young men  were assigned one side and all the front gallery, made such an uproar that  the town had to call a meeting, and restore to them their \"woman's rights\"  in half the front gallery.    Infants were brought to church in their mothers' arms, and on summer days  the young mothers often sat at the meeting-house door or in the porch,--if  porch there were,--where, listening to the word of God, they could attend  also to the wants of their babes. I have heard, too, of a little cage, or  frame, which was to be seen in the early meeting-houses, for the purpose  of holding children who were too young to sit alone,--poor Puritan babies!  Little girls sat with their mothers or elder sisters on \"crickets\" within  the pews; or if the family were over-numerous, the children and crickets  exundated into \"the alley without the pues.\" Often a row of little  daughters of Zion sat on three-legged stools and low seats the entire  length of the aisle,--weary, sleepy, young sentinels \"without the gates.\"    The boys, the Puritan boys, those wild animals who were regarded with such  suspicion, such intense disfavor, by all elderly Puritan eyes, and who were  publicly stigmatized by the Duxbury elders as \"ye wretched boys on ye Lords  Day,\" were herded by themselves. They usually sat on the pulpit and gallery  stairs, and constables or tithingmen were appointed to watch over them and  control them. In Salem, in 1676, it was ordered that \"all ye boyes of ye  towne are and shall be appointed to sitt upon ye three pair of stairs in ye  meeting-house on ye Lords Day, and Wm. Lord is appointed to look after ye  boyes yt sitte upon ye pulpit stairs. Reuben Guppy is to look and order soe  many of ye boyes as may be convenient, and if any are unruly, to present  their names, as the law directs.\" Nowadays we should hardly "]]]
