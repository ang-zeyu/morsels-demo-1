It is true, as we have seen above, that  some brave soldiers listening, perhaps, more to the voice of humanity and  French honor, than to the strict maxims of discipline, were desirous of  employing their arms against those who basely abandoned us, but, that their  will and their actions were paralized by the passive obedience which they  owed to their officers, who opposed this resolution.    The other, Mr. Danglas, a lieutenant, who had lately left the  _gardes-du-corps_, had at first embarked with us upon the raft, where his  post was assigned him, but when he saw the danger which he incurred on this  unstable machine, he made haste to quit it, on the pretext that he had  forgotten something on board the frigate, and did not return. It was he  whom we saw, armed with a carbine, threaten to fire on the barge of the  governor, when it began to move from the frigate. This movement, and some  other actions which were taken for madness, nearly cost him his life; for  while he was thus giving himself up to a kind of extravagance, the captain  took flight, and abandoned him on board the frigate with the sixty-three  men whom he left there. When M. Danglas saw himself treated in this manner,  he gave marks of the most furious despair. They were obliged to hinder him  from attempting his own life. With loud cries he invoked death, which he  believed inevitable in the midst of perils so imminent. It is certain that  if Mr. Espiau, who had his long-boat already full, had not returned to take  from on board the frigate, the forty-six men, among whom, was Mr. Danglas,  he and all his companions would not, perhaps, have experienced a better  fate than the seventeen who were finally left on board the Medusa.    After the disappearance of the boats, the consternation was extreme: all  the terrors of thirst and famine arose before our imaginations, and we had  besides to contend with a perfidious element, which already covered the  half of our bodies: when recovered from their stupefaction, the sailors and  soldiers gave themselves up to despair; all saw inevitable destruction  before them, and gave vent in lamentations to the gloomy thoughts which  agitated them. All we said did not at first avail to calm their fears, in  which we however participated, but which a greater degree of strength of  mind enabled us to dissemble. At last, a firm countenance and consoling  words succeeded in calming them by degrees, but could not wholly dispel the  terror with which they were struck; for according to the judicious  reflection, made after reading our deplorable story, by Mr. Jay, whose  authority we quote with pleasure, \"To support extreme misfortunes, and what  is worthy of remark, to bear great fatigues, moral energy is much more  necessary than corporeal strength, nay, than the habit of privations and  hard labour. On this narrow theatre where so many sufferings are united,  where the most cruel extremes of hunger and thirst are experienced, strong  and indefatigable men who have been brought up to the most laborious  professions, sink in succession under the weight of the common destiny,  while men of a weak constitution, and not inured to fatigue, find in their  minds the strength which their bodies want, endure with courage unheard-of  trials, and issue victorious from their struggle with the most horrible  afflictions. It is to the education they have received, to the exercise of  their intellectual faculties, that they owe this astonishing superiority  and their deliverance,\" When tranquillity was a little restored, we began  to look upon the raft for the charts, the compass and the anchor, which we  presumed had been placed there, from what had been said to us at the time  we quitted the frigate. These highly necessary articles had not been put  upon our machine. The want of a compass in particular, greatly alarmed us,  and we uttered cries of rage and vengeance. Mr. Correard then recollected,  that he had seen one in the hands of one of the chief workmen under his  command, and enquired of this man about it: \"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"I have it  with me.\" This news transported us with joy, and we thought that our safety  depended on this feeble resource. This little compass was about the size of  a crown-piece, and far from correct. He who has not been exposed to events,  in which his existence was in imminent peril, can form but a faint idea of  the value which one then sets upon the most common and simple objects, with  what avidity one seizes the slightest means, that are capable of softening  the rigour of the fate with which one has to contend. This compass was  given to the commander of the raft; but an accident deprived us of it for  ever: it fell, and was lost between the pieces of wood which composed our  machine: we had kept it only for a few hours; after this loss, we had  nothing to guide us but the rising and setting of the sun.    We had all left the frigate without taking any food: hunger began to be  severely felt; we mixed our biscuit-paste (which had fallen into the sea)  with a little wine, and we distributed it thus prepared: such was our first  meal, and the best we had the whole time we were on the raft.    An order, according to numbers, was fixed for the distribution of our  miserable provisions. The ration of wine was fixed at three quarters[21] a  day: we shall say no more of the biscuit: the first distribution consumed  it entirely. The day passed over pretty quietly: we conversed on the means  which we should employ to save ourselves; we spoke of it as a certainty,  which animated our courage: and we kept up that of the soldiers, by  cherishing the hope of being soon able to revenge ourselves upon those who  had so basely abandoned us. This hope of vengeance inspired us all equally,  and we uttered a thousand imprecations against those who had left us a prey  to so many misfortunes and dangers. The officer who commanded, the raft  being unable to move, Mr. Savigny took on himself the care of setting up  the mast; he caused the pole of one of the frigate's masts to be cut in  two; we employed the main-top-gallant sail; the mast was kept up by the  rope which had served to tow us, of which we made shrouds and stays: it was  fixed on the anterior third of the raft. The sail trimmed very well, but  the effect of it was of very little use to us; it served only when the wind  came from behind, and to make the raft preserve this direction it was  necessary to trim the sail, as if the wind came athwart. We think that the  cross position which our raft always retained, may be attributed to the too  great length of the pieces of wood which projected on each side.    In the evening, our hearts and our prayers, with the impulse natural to the  unfortunate, were directed towards heaven; we invoked it with fervour, and  we derived from our prayers the advantage of hoping in our safety: one must  have experienced cruel situations, to imagine what a soothing charm, in the  midst of misfortune, is afforded by the sublime idea of a God, the  protector of the unfortunate. One consoling idea still pleased our  imaginations; we presumed that the little division had sailed for the Isle  of Arguin, and that after having landed there a part of its people, would  return to our assistance: this idea, which we tried to inspire into our  soldiers and sailors, checked their clamours. The night came, and our hopes  were not yet fulfilled: the wind freshened, the sea rose considerably. What  a dreadful night! Nothing but the idea of seeing the boats the next day,  gave some consolation to our people; who being most of them unused to the  motion of a vessel,[22] at every shock of the sea, fell upon each other.  Mr. Savigny, assisted by some persons, who, in the midst of this disorder,  still retained their presence of mind, fastened some ropes to the pieces of  the raft: the men took hold of them, and by means of this support, were  better able to resist the force of the waves: some were obliged to fasten  themselves. In the middle of the night the weather was very bad; very heavy  waves rolled upon us, and often threw us down with great violence; the  cries of the people were mingled with the roaring of the billows; a  dreadful sea lifted us every moment from the raft, and threatened to carry  us away. This scene was rendered still more awful by the horrors of a very  dark night; for some moments we thought that we saw fires at a distance. We  had taken the precaution to hang, at the top of the mast, some gun-powder  and pistols, with which we had provided ourselves on board the frigate: we  made signals by burning a great many charges of powder; we even fired some  pistol-shot, but it seems that these fires were only an illusion of the  eyesight, or perhaps they were nothing but the dashing of the breakers.    This whole night we contended against death, holding fast by the ropes  which were strongly fastened. Rolled by the waves from the back to the  front, and from the front to the back, and sometimes precipitated into the  sea, suspended between life and death, lamenting our misfortune, certain to  perish, yet still struggling for a fragment of existence with the cruel  element which threatened to swallow us up. Such was our situation till  day-break; every moment were heard the lamentable cries of the soldiers and  sailors; they prepared themselves for death; they bid farewell to each  other, imploring the protection of Heaven, and addressing fervent prayers  to God: all made vows to him, notwithstanding the certainty that they  should never be able to fulfil them. Dreadful situation! How is it possible  to form an idea of it, which is not below the truth!    About seven o'clock, in the morning, the sea fell a little, the wind blew  with less fury; but what a sight presented itself to our view! Ten or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#9)"],[1,"of dark eyes as steel-blue eyes flashed  frank admiration.    Kerry, who quarrelled with everybody except the Assistant Commissioner,  had only found one cause of quarrel with Mary. He was a devout Roman  Catholic, and for five years he had clung with the bull-dog tenacity  which was his to the belief that he could convert his wife to the  faith of Rome. She remained true to the Scottish Free Church, in whose  precepts she had been reared, and at the end of the five years Kerry  gave it up and admired her all the more for her Caledonian strength of  mind. Many and heated were the debates he had held with worthy Father  O'Callaghan respecting the validity of a marriage not solemnized by a  priest, but of late years he had grown reconciled to the parting of  the ways on Sunday morning; and as the early mass was over before  the Scottish service he was regularly to be seen outside a certain  Presbyterian chapel waiting for his heretical spouse.    He pulled her down on to his knee and kissed her.    \"It's twelve hours since I saw you,\" he said.    She rested her arm on the back of the saddle-back chair, and her dark  head close beside Kerry's fiery red one.    \"I kenned ye had a new case on,\" she said, \"when it grew so late. How  long can ye stay?\"    \"An hour. No more. There's a lot to do before the papers come out in  the morning. By breakfast time all England, including the murderer, will  know I'm in charge of the case. I wish I could muzzle the Press.\"    \"'Tis a murder, then? The Lord gi'e us grace. Ye'll be wishin' to tell  me?\"    \"Yes. I'm stumped!\"    \"Ye've time for a rest an' a smoke. Put ye're slippers on.\"    \"I've no time for that, Mary.\"    She stood up and took the slippers from the hearth.    \"Put ye're slippers on,\" she repeated firmly.    Kerry stooped without another word and began to unlace his brogues.  Meanwhile from a side-table his wife brought a silver tobacco-box and  a stumpy Irish clay. The slippers substituted for his shoes, Kerry  lovingly filled the cracked and blackened bowl with strong Irish twist,  which he first teased carefully in his palm. The bowl rested almost  under his nostrils when he put the pipe in his mouth, and how he  contrived to light it without burning his moustache was not readily  apparent. He succeeded, however, and soon was puffing clouds of pungent  smoke into the air with the utmost contentment.    \"Now,\" said his wife, seating herself upon the arm of the chair, \"tell  me, Dan.\"    Thereupon began a procedure identical to that which had characterized  the outset of every successful case of the Chief Inspector. He rapidly  outlined the complexities of the affair in old Bond Street, and Mary  Kerry surveyed the problem with a curious and almost fey detachment of  mind, which enabled her to see light where all was darkness to the man  on the spot. With the clarity of a trained observer Kerry described the  apartments of Kazmah, the exact place where the murdered man had been  found, and the construction of the rooms. He gave the essential points  from the evidence of the several witnesses, quoting the exact times at  which various episodes had taken place. Mary Kerry, looking straightly  before her with unseeing eyes, listened in silence until he ceased  speaking; then:    \"There are really but twa rooms,\" she said, in a faraway voice, \"but the  second o' these is parteetioned into three parts?\"    \"That's it.\"    \"A door free the landing opens upon the fairst room, a door free a  passage opens upon the second. Where does yon passage lead?\"    \"From the main stair along beside Kazmah's rooms to a small back stair.  This back stair goes from top to bottom of the building, from the end of  the same hallway as the main stair.\"    \"There is na either way out but by the front door?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then if the evidence o' the Spinker man is above suspeecion, Mrs. Irvin  and this Kazmah were still on the premises when ye arrived?\"    \"Exactly. I gathered that much at Vine Street before I went on to Bond  Street. The whole block was surrounded five minutes after my arrival,  and it still is.\"    \"What ither offices are in this passage?\"    \"None. It's a blank wall on the left, and one door on the right--the  one opening into the Kazmah office. There are other premises on the same  floor, but they are across the landing.\"    \"What premises?\"    \"A solicitor and a commission agent.\"    \"The floor below?\"    \"It's all occupied by a modiste, Renan.\"    \"The top floor?\"    \"Cubanis Cigarette Company, a servants' and an electrician.\"    \"Nae more?\"    \"No more.\"    \"Where does yon back stair open on the topmaist floor?\"    \"In a corridor similar to that alongside Kazmah's. It has two windows  on the right overlooking a narrow roof and the top of the arcade, and on  the left is the Cubanis Cigarette Company. The other offices are across  the landing.\"    Mary Kerry stared into space awhile.    \"Kazmah and Mrs. Irvin could ha' come down to the fairst floor, or gene  up to the thaird floor unseen by the Spinker man,\" she said dreamily.    \"But they couldn't have reached the street, my dear!\" cried Kerry.    \"No--they couldn'a ha' gained the street.\"    She became silent again, her husband watching her expectantly. Then:    \"If puir Sir Lucien Pyne was killed at a quarter after seven--the time  his watch was broken--the native sairvent did no' kill him. Frae the  Spinker's evidence the black man went awe' before then,\" she said. \"Mrs.  Irvin?\"    Kerry shook his head.    \"From all accounts a slip of a woman,\" he replied. \"It was a strong hand  that struck the blow.\"    \"Kazmah?\"    \"Probably.\"    \"Mr. Quentin Gray came back wi' a cab and went upstairs, free the  Spinker's evidence, at aboot a quarter after seven, and came doon five  meenites later sair pale an' fretful.\"    Kerry surrounded himself and the speaker with wreaths of stifling smoke.    \"We have only the bare word of Mr. Gray that he didn't go in again,  Mary; but I believe him. He's a hot-headed fool, but square.\"    \"Then 'twas yon Kazmah,\" announced Mrs. Kerry. \"Who is Kazmah?\"    Her husband laughed shortly.    \"That's the point at which I got stumped,\" he replied. \"We've heard of  him at the Yard, of course, and we know that under the cloak of a dealer  in Eastern perfumes he carried on a fortune-telling business. He managed  to avoid prosecution, though. It took me over an hour tonight to explore  the thought-reading mechanism; it's a sort of Maskelyne's Mysteries  worked from the inside room. But who Kazmah is or what's his nationality  I know no more than the man in the moon.\"    \"Pairfume?\" queried the far-away voice.    \"Yes, Mary. The first room is a sort of miniature scent bazaar. There  are funny little imitation antique flasks of Kazmah preparations,  creams, perfumes and incense, also small square wooden boxes of a kind  of Turkish delight, and a stock of Egyptian mummy-beads, statuettes, and  the like, which may be genuine for all I know.\"    \"Nae books or letters?\"    \"Not a thing, except his own advertisements, a telephone directory, and  so on.\"    \"The inside office bureau?\"    \"Empty as Mother Hubbard's cupboard!\"    \"The place was ransacked by the same folk that emptied the dead man's  pockets so as tee leave nae clue,\" pronounced the sibyl-like voice. \"Mr.  Gray said he had choc'lates wi' him. Where did he leave them?\"    \"Mary, you're a wonder!\" exclaimed the admiring Kerry. \"The box was  lying on the divan in the first room where he said he had left it on  going out for a cab.\"    \"Does nane o' the evidence show if Mrs. Irvin had been to Kazmah's  before?\"    \"Yes. She went there fairly regularly to buy perfume.\"    \"No' for the fortune-tellin'?\"    \"No. According to Mr. Gray, to buy perfume.\"    \"Had Mr. Gray been there wi' her before?\"    \"No. Sir Lucien Pyne seems to have been her pretty constant companion.\"    \"Do ye suspect she was his lady-love?\"    \"I believe Mr. Gray suspects something of the kind.\"    \"And Mr. Gray?\"    \"He is not such an old friend as Sir Lucien was. But I fancy  nevertheless it was Mr. Gray that her husband doubted.\"    \"Do ye suspect the puir soul had cause, Dan?\"    \"No,\" replied Kerry promptly; \"I don't. The boy is mad about her, but I  fancy she just liked his company. He's the heir of Lord Wrexborough, and  Mrs. Irvin used to be a stage beauty. It's a usual state of affairs, and  more often than not means nothing.\"    \"I dinna ken sich folk,\" declared Mary Kerry. \"They a'most desairve all  they get. They are bound tee come tee nae guid end. Where did ye say Sir  Lucien lived?\"    \"Albemarle Street; just round the corner.\"    \"Ye told me that he only kepit twa sairvents: a cook, hoosekeper, who  lived awe', an' a man--a foreigner?\"    \"A kind of half-baked Dago, named Juan Mareno. A citizen of the United  States according to his own account.\"    \"Ye dinna like Juan Mareno?\"    \"He's a hateful swine!\" flashed Kerry, with sudden venom. \"I'm watching  Mareno very closely. Coombes is at work upon Sir Lucien's papers. His  life was a bit of a mystery. He seems to have had no relations living,  and I can't find that he even employed a solicitor.\"    \"Ye'll be sairchin' for yon Egyptian?\"    \"The servant? Yes. We'll have him by the morning, and then we shall know  who Kazmah is. Meanwhile, in which of the offices is Kazmah hiding?\"    Mary Kerry was silent for so long that her husband repeated the  question:    \"In which of the offices is Kazmah hiding?\"    \"In nane,\" she said dreamily. \"Ye surrounded the buildings too late, I  ken.\"    \"Eh!\" cried Kerry, turning his head excitedly. \"But the man Brisley was  at the door all night!\"    \"It doesna' matter. They have escapit.\"    Kerry scratched his close-cropped head in angry perplexity.    \"You're always right, Mary,\" he said. \"But hang me if--Never mind! When  we get the servant we'll soon get Kazmah.\"    \"Aye,\" murmured his wife. \"If ye hae na' got Kazmah the now.\"    \"But--Mary! This isn't helping me! It's"]]]
