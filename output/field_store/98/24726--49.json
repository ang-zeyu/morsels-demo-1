Course I members hearin' em talk bout Mars Newt. I named fur  my ma's old mistress--Miss Selie Thompson and Mars Newt Thompson. Pa  died when I was three years old. He was a soldier. Ma had seven  children. They have bigger families then than they have now. Ma name  Emmaline Thompson. Pa name Sam Adair. I can't tell you about him. I  heard em say his pa was a white man. He was light skinned. Old folks  didn't talk much foe children so I don't know well nough to tell you  bout him. Ma was a cook and a licensed midwife in Alabama. She waited on  both black and white. Ma never staid at home much. She worked out. I  come to Mississippi after I married and had one child. Ma and all come.  Ma went to Tom McGehee's to cook after freedom. She married old man  named Lewis Chase and they worked on where he had been raised. His name  was Lewis Sprangle. He looked after the stock and drove the carriage.  Daniel Sprangle had a store and a big farm. He had three girls and three  boys, I was their house girl. Mama lived on the place and give me to em  cause they could do better part by me than she could. I was six years  old when she give me to em. They lernt me to sweep, knit, crochet, piece  quilts. She lernt her children thater way sometimes. Miss Nancy Sprangle  didn't treat me no different from her own girls. Miss Dora married Mr.  Pitt Loney and I was dressed up and held up her train (long dress and  veil). I stayed with Miss Dora after she married. One of the girls  married Mr. John Galbreth. I married and went home then come to  Mississippi. Mrs. Gables, Mr. Gables was old people but they had two  adopted boys. I took them boys to the field to work wid my children. She  sewed for me and my children. Her girls cooked all we et in busy times.  They done work at the house but they didn't work in the field.    \"I been married five times. Every time I married I married at home.  Mighty little marryin' goin' on now--mighty little. Mama stayed wid Mr.  Sprangle till we all got grown. Miss Nancy's girls married so that all  the way I knowd how to do. I had a good time. I danced every chance I  got. I been well blessed all my life till I'm gettin' feeble now.    \"Papa run the gin on Mr. Sprangle's place, then he went to war, come  back foe he died. I recken he come home sick cause he died pretty soon.    \"I jess can member this Ku Klux broke down our door wid hatchets. It  scared us all to death. They didn't do nuthin' to us. They was huntin'  Uncle Jeff. He wasn't bout our house. He was ox driver fer Mr. Sprangle.  Him and a family of pore white folks got to fussin' bout a bridle. Some  of em was dressed up when they come to our house ma said. After that Mr.  Kirby killed him close to his home startin' out one mornin' to work. His  name was Uncle Jeff Saxon. Ma knowd it was some of the men right on Mr.  Sprangle's place whut come to our house.    \"I live wid my daughter. I get $8 from the Welfare.    \"If they vote for better it be all right. I never seen no poles. I don't  know how they vote. I'm too old to start up votin'.    \"Lawd you got me now. The times changed and got so fast. It all beyond  me. I jes' listens.

Anderson (dark brown)                      3200 W. 18th Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 78  Occupation: House and yard man      [HW: Serves the \"Lawd\"]    \"I don't know nothin' about slavery. You know I wouldn't know nothin'  bout it cause I was only four years old when the war ended. All I know  is I was born in slavery; but I don't know nothin' bout it.    \"I don't remember nothin' of my parents. Times was all confused and old  folks didn't talk before chilun. They didn't have time. Besides, my  mother and father were separated.    \"I was born in Arkansas and have lived here all my life. But I don't  gossip and entertain. I just moved in this house last week. Took a  wheelbarrow and brought all these things here myself.    \"Those boys out there jus' threw a stone against the house. I thought  the house was falling. I work all day and when night comes, I'm tired.    \"I don't have no wife, no children, nothin'; nobody to help me out. I  don't ask the neighbors nothin' cept to clear out this junk they left  here.    \"I ain't goin' to talk about the Ku Klux. I got other things to think  about. It takes all my time and strength to do my work and live a  Christian. Folks got so nowadays they don't care bout nothin'. I just  live here and serve the Lawd.\"      Interviewer's Comments    Anderson is separated from his wife who left him. He lost his home a  short time ago. A few months ago, he was so sick he was expected to die.  He supports himself through the friendliness of a few white people who  give him odds and ends of work to do.    I made three calls on him, helped him set up his stoves and his beds and  clear up his house a little bit since he had just moved into it and had  a good deal of work to do. His misfortunes have made him unwilling to  talk just now, but he will give a good interview later I am certain.          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Henry Anthony; R.F.D. #1 Biscoe, Arkansas  Age: 84      \"I was born at Jackson, North Carolina. My master and mistress named  Betsy and Jason Williams but my pa's name was Anthony. My young master  was a orderly seargent. He took me wid him to return some mules and  wagons. He showed me what he want done an I followed him round wid  wagons. The wagons hauled ammunition and provisions. Pa worked for the  master and ma cooked. They got sold to Lausen Capert. When freedom come  they went back and stayed a month or two at Williams then we all went  back to John Odom. We stayed round close and farmed and worked till they  died. I married and when I had four or five children I heard ob dis  country. I come on immigration ticket to Mr. Aydelott here at Biscoe.  Train full of us got together and come. One white man got us all up and  brought us here to Biscoe. I farmed for Mr. Aydelott four or five years,  then for Mr. Bland, Mr. Scroggin.    \"I never went to school a day in my life. I used to vote here in Biseoe  right smart. I let the young folks do my votin. They can tell more about  it. I sho do not think it is the woman's place to vote an hold all the  jobs from the men. Iffen you don't in the Primary cause you don't know  nuf to pick out a man, you sho don't know nuthin er tall bout votin in  the General lection.

It is bad when you caint get work you able  to do on that's hard on the old folks. I could saved. I did save right  smart. Sickness come on. Sometimes you have a bad crop year, make  nuthin, but you have to live on. Young folks don't see no hard times if  they keep well an able to work.    \"I get commodities and $6 a month. I do a little if I can.    \"One time my son bought a place fo me and him. He paid all cept $70. I  don't know whut it cost now. It was 47 acres. I worked on it three  years.

He was married twice. His oldest son was Jim McCall. He was in  the War. Yes ma'am, the Civil War.    \"Paul McCall raised me up with his chillun and I never did call him  master, just called him pappy, and Jim McCall, I called him brother Jim.  Just raised us all up there in the yard. My grandmother was the cook.    \"There wasn't no fightin' in Union County but I 'member when the Yankees  was goin' through and singin'      'The Union forever, hurrah, boys, hurrah     We'll rally 'round the flag, boys,     Shouting the battle cry of freedom.'

Brother Jim would cut fishin'  canes and plat 'em together--they called 'em a pack--five in a row, just  like my fingers. Anybody that knowed how could sure make music on 'em.  Tom Rollins, that was my baby uncle, he was a banjo picker.    \"I can remember a heap a things that happened, but 'bout slavery, I  didn't know one day from another.

To this    occasion therefore is it to be imputed, that there are so many    different sepulchres of Osiris shewn, in Egypt; for we are told, that    wherever Isis met with any of the scattered limbs of her husband, she    there buried it. There are others however who contradict this    relation, and tell us, that this variety of Sepulchres was owing    rather to the policy of the queen, who, instead of the real body, as    was pretended, presented these several cities with the image only of    her husband: and that she did this, not only to render the honours,    which would by this means be paid to his memory, more extensive, but    likewise that she might hereby elude the malicious search of Typho;    who, if he got the better of Orus in the war wherein they were going    to be engaged, distracted by this multiplicity of Sepulchres, might    despair of being able to find the true one--we are told moreover, that    notwithstanding all her search, Isis was never able to recover the    member of Osiris, which having been thrown into the Nile immediately    upon its separation from the rest of the body, had been devoured by    the Lepidotus, the Phagrus, and the Oxyrynchus, fish which of all    others, for this reason, the Egyptians have in more especial    avoidance. In order however to make some amends for the loss, Isis    consecrated the Phallus made in imitation of it, and instituted a    solemn festival to its memory, which is even, to this day observed by    the Egyptians.      \"After these things, Osiris returning from the other world, appeared    to his son Orus, encouraged him to the battle, and at the same time    instructed him in the exercise of arms. He then asked him, 'what he    thought was the moat glorious action a man could perform?' to which    Orua replied, 'to revenge the injuries offered to his father and    mother.' He then asked him, 'what animal he thought most serviceable    to a soldier?' and being answered 'a horse'; this raised the wonder of    Osiris, so that he farther questioned him, 'why he preferred a horse    before a lion?' because, adds Orus, 'tho' the lion be the more    serviceable creature to one who stands in need of help, yet is the    horse [Footnote: The horse does not appear to have been known in Egypt    before the XVIIIth dynasty; this portion of Plutarch's version of the    history of Osiris must, then, be later than B.C. 1500.] more useful in    overtaking and cutting off a flying adversary.' These replies much    rejoiced Osiris, as they showed him that his son was sufficiently    prepared for his enemy--We are moreover told, that among the great    numbers who were continually deserting from Typho's party was his    concubine Thueris, and that a serpent pursuing her as she was coming    over to Orus, was slain by her soldiers--the memory of which action,    say they, is still preserved in that cord which is thrown into the    midst of their assemblies, and then chopt into pieces--Afterwards it    came to a battle between, them which lasted many days; but victory at    length inclined to Orus, Typho himself being taken prisoner. Isis    however, to whose custody he was committed, was so far from putting    him to death, that she even loosed his bonds and set him at liberty.    This action of his mother so extremely incensed Orus, that he laid    hands upon her, and pulled off the ensign of royalty which she wore on    her head; and instead thereof Hermes clapt on an helmet made in the    shape of an oxe's head--After this, Typho publicly accused Orus of    bastardy; but by the assistance of Hermes (Thoth) his legitimacy was    fully established by the judgment of the Gods themselves--After this;    there were two other battles fought between them, in both of which    Typho had the worst. Furthermore, Isis is said to have accompanied    with Osiris after his death, and in consequence hereof to have brought    forth Harpocrates, who came into the world before his time, and lame    in his lower limbs.\"    When we examine this story by the light of the results of hieroglyphic  decipherment, we find that a large portion of it is substantiated by  Egyptian texts: _e.g._, Osiris was the son of Seb and Nut; the Epact is  known in the Calendars as \"the five additional days of the year\"; the  five gods, Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys, were born on the days  mentioned by Plutarch; the 17th day of Athyr (Hathor) is marked as  triply unlucky in the Calendars; the wanderings and troubles of Isis are  described, and \"lamentations\" which she is supposed to have uttered are  found in the texts; lists of the shrines of Osiris are preserved in  several inscriptions; the avenging of his father by Horus is referred to  frequently in papyri and other documents; the conflict between Set and  Horus is described fully in a papyrus in the British Museum (No.  10,184); a hymn in the papyrus of Hunefer relates all that Thoth  performed for Osiris; and the begetting of Horus by Osiris after death  is mentioned in a hymn to Osiris dating from the XVIIIth dynasty in the  following passage:--      \"Thy sister put forth her protecting power for thee, she scattered    abroad those who were her enemies, she drove away evil hap, she    pronounced mighty words of power, she made cunning her tongue, and her    words failed not. The glorious Isis was perfect in command and in    speech, and she avenged her brother. She sought him without ceasing,    she wandered round and round the earth uttering cries of pain, and she    rested (_or_ alighted) not until she had found him. She overshadowed    him with her feathers, she made air (_or_ wind) with her wings, and    she uttered cries at the burial of her brother. She raised up the    prostrate form of him whose heart was still, she took from him of his    essence, she conceived and brought forth a child, she suckled it in    secret, and none knew the place thereof; and the arm of the child hath    waxed strong in the great house of Seb. The company of the gods    rejoice, and are glad at the coming of Osiris's son Horus, and firm of    heart and triumphant is the son of Isis, the heir of Osiris.\"    [Footnote: This remarkable hymn was first made known by Chabas, who    published a translation of it, with notes, in _Revue Archeologique_,    Paris, 1857, t. xiv. p. 65 ff.]    [Illustration: 1.

The goddess Nekhebet  presenting years, and life, stability, power, and sovereignty to the son  of Osiris. 5. The goddess Sati presenting periods of years, and life,  stability, power, and sovereignty to the son of Osiris.]    What form the details of the history of Osiris took in the early  dynasties it is impossible to say, and we know not whether Osiris was  the god of the resurrection to the predynastic or prehistoric Egyptians,  or whether that _role_ was attributed to him after Mena began to rule in  Egypt. There is, however, good reason for assuming that in the earliest  dynastic times he occupied the position of god and judge of those who  had risen from the dead by his help, for already in the IVth dynasty,  about B.C. 3800, king Mea-kau-R[=a] (the Mycerinus of the Greeks) is  identified with him, and on his coffin not only is he called \"Osiris,  King of the South and North, Men-kau-R[=a], living for ever,\" but the  genealogy of Osiris is attributed to him, and he is declared to be \"born  of heaven, offspring of Nut, flesh and bone of Seb.\" It is evident that  the priests of Heliopolis \"edited\" the religious texts copied and  multiplied in the College to suit their own views, but in the early  times when they began their work, the worship of Osiris was so  widespread, and the belief in him as the god of the resurrection so  deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Egyptians, that even in the  Heliopolitan system of theology Osiris and his cycle, or company of  gods, were made to hold a very prominent position. He represented to men  the idea of a man who was both god and man, and he typified to the  Egyptians in all ages the being who by reason of his sufferings and  death as a man could sympathize with them in their own sickness and  death. The idea of his human personality also satisfied their cravings  and yearnings for intercourse with a being who, though he was partly  divine, yet had much in common with themselves. Originally they looked  upon Osiris as a man who lived on the earth as they lived, who ate and  drank, who suffered a cruel death, who by the help of certain gods  triumphed over death, and attained unto everlasting life. But what  Osiris did they could do, and what the gods did for Osiris they must  also do for them, and as the gods brought about his resurrection so they  must bring about theirs, and as they made him the ruler of the  underworld so they must make them to enter his kingdom and to live there  as long as the god himself lived. Osiris, in some of his aspects, was  identified with the Nile, and with R[=a], and with several other \"gods\"  known to the Egyptians, but it was in his aspect as god of the  resurrection and of eternal life that he appealed to men in the valley  of the Nile; and for thousands of years men and women died believing  that, inasmuch as all that was done for Osiris would be done for them  symbolically, they like him would rise again, and inherit life  everlasting. However far back we trace religious ideas in Egypt, we  never approach a time when it can be said that there did not exist a  belief in the Resurrection, for everywhere it is assumed that Osiris  rose from the dead; sceptics must have existed, and they probably asked  their priests what"]]]
