[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A yearling colt that died of aneurism colic.]    Some species attach themselves to the intestinal wall, suck the blood of  the host and cause anaemia and debility. Colic resulting from _circulatory  disturbances_ is not common. The female of a certain species of  _strongulus_ deposits eggs in the mucous membrane. On hatching, the larvae  may enter a blood capillary, drift along in the blood stream and finally  come to rest in a large blood-vessel that supplies a certain portion of the  intestines with blood. Here the parasite develops. The wall of the vessel  becomes irritated and inflamed, pieces of fibrin flake off and drift along  the blood stream until finally a vessel too small for the floating particle  to pass through is reached and the vessel becomes plugged. The loop of  intestine supplied by it receives no blood. A temporary paralysis of the  loop occurs, which persists until a second vessel is able to take over the  function of the one that is plugged. This form of colic is most common in  old horses (Fig. 16).    Such complications of acute indigestion as _twisting, infolding_ and  _displacement of the intestine_ may occur. It is not uncommon for a  stallion to suffer from strangulated hernia, due to a rather large internal  inguinal ring and a loop of the intestine passing through it and into the  inguinal canal or scrotum. Such displacements are usually accompanied by  severe colicky pains.    _The symptoms_ vary in the different cases. In the mild form, the colicky  pains are not prominent, but in the acute form, the animal is restless,  getting up and down in the stall and rolling over. These movements are  especially marked when the abdominal pain is severe.    _In the spasmodic form_ the attack comes on suddenly, the colicky pains are  severe, and the peristaltic movement of the intestine is marked and  accompanied by loud intestinal sounds. In most cases of indigestion  characterized by fermentation and collections of gas in the intestine there  is gastric tympany as well.    Acute indigestion characterized by _impaction_ of the large intestine  pursues a longer course than the forms just mentioned, and the abdominal  pain is not severe.    _Congestion and inflammation_ of the intestine may result from the  irritation produced by the feed. When this occurs, the abdominal pain is  less violent. The animal usually acts dull, the walk is slow and unsteady,  and the respirations and pulse beats may be quickened.    A large percentage of the cases of acute indigestion terminate fatally. The  course of the disease varies from a few hours to several days.    _The treatment_ is both _preventive_ and _curative_. The preventive  treatment is by far the most important. This consists in observing right  methods of feeding and caring for horses. The attendant should note the  condition of the animal before feeding grain, feed regularly and avoid  sudden changes in feed. If a horse has received unusual exercise, it is  proper to feed hay first, and when the animal is cooled out, water and feed  grain. Drinking a small quantity of water when tired or following a meal is  not injurious, but a large quantity of water taken at such times is  injurious and dangerous to the health of the animal. The feeding of spoiled  or mouldy feeds to horses is highly injurious.    The horse should be given a roomy, comfortable stall that is well bedded,  or a clean grass lot. If the attack appears when the animal is in harness,  we should stop working it and remove the harness immediately. Work or  exercise usually aggravates the case and may cause congestion and  inflammation of important body organs. In cold weather the animal should be  protected by blankets. If the pain is violent, sedatives may be given. The  gaseous disturbances should be relieved by puncturing the wall of the  intestine with the trocar and cannula. Rectal injections of cold water may  be resorted to. Fluid extract of cannabis indica in quarter ounce doses and  repeated in one hour may be given in linseed oil. In all cases it is  advisable to drench the animal with one pint of raw linseed oil and two  ounces of turpentine. Strychnine, eserine and pilocarpine are the drugs  commonly used by the veterinarians in the treatment of acute indigestion.  Small and repeated doses of the above drugs are preferred to large doses.  This is one of the diseases that requires prompt and skilled attention.    Sharp, uneven or diseased teeth should receive the necessary attention. In  old horses, chopped hay or ground feeds should be fed when necessary.  Debility resulting from hard work, wrong methods of feeding and intestinal  disorders must be corrected before the periodic attacks of indigestion can  be relieved. If the presence of intestinal worms is suspected, the  necessary treatment for ridding the animal of these parasites should be  resorted to.    Bitter or saline tonics should be administered in the feed when necessary.  The following formula is useful as a digestive tonic: Sodium bicarbonate  and sodium sulfate, one pound of each, powdered gentian one-half pound, and  oil meal five pounds. A small handful of this mixture may be given with the  feed two or three times daily.    INFLAMMATION OF THE INTESTINES.--The same causes mentioned in inflammation  of the stomach and acute indigestion may cause this disease. It is most  frequent at times when there are great variations in the temperature.  Sudden cold or any influence that chills the surface of the body, or  internal cold caused by drinking ice water or eating frozen feed, may cause  it. The infectious forms of enteritis are caused by germs and ptomaines in  the feed. Drinking filthy water or eating spoiled, mouldy feeds are common  causes. In cattle pasturing in low, marshy places, enteritis may be common.  The toxic form is caused by irritating poisons, such as caustic acids,  alkalies and meat brine.    _In the mild form of enteritis_ the appetite is irregular, the animal acts  dull and stupid and may be noticed lying down more than common. Slight  abdominal pains occur, especially following a meal. An elevation in the  body temperature may be noted and the animal may drink more water than  usual. Constipation or a slight diarrhoea may be present. The feces may be  soft and foul smelling, coated with mucus, and slightly discolored with  blood.    _In the severe form of enteritis_ pressure on the abdomen may cause pain,  the respiration and pulse beats are quickened and the body temperature is  elevated. The abdominal pain may be severe and the animal is greatly  depressed or acts dull. The movement of the intestines is suppressed at  first and constipation occurs. Fermentation and the formation of gas may  take place. Later the intestinal peristalsis increases and a foul-smelling  diarrhoea sets in that is often mixed with blood. In the toxic form there  may be marked nervous symptoms. Spasms, convulsions, stupefaction and coma  may be manifested.    In the mild form recovery usually occurs within a few days. The more  serious forms of the disease do not terminate so favorably. In the toxic  form death usually occurs within a few days.    The large majority of cases of enteritis can be prevented by practising the  necessary _preventive measures_. It is very necessary that animals exposed  to cold be provided with dry sleeping quarters that are free from draughts.  Where a number of animals are fed a heavy grain ration, or fed from the  same trough, they should be kept under close observation. This is necessary  in order to detect cases of indigestion or overfeeding early, and resort to  the necessary lines of treatment, so as to prevent further irritation to  the intestinal tract. Live stock should not be forced to drink water that  is ice-cold. Low, poorly-drained land is not a safe pasture for cattle and  horses. Spoiled roots, grains and silage, mouldy, dirty roughage and  decomposed slops should not be fed to live stock.    _The treatment_ consists in withholding all feed and giving the animal  comfortable, quiet quarters--warm quarters and protection from the cold,  providing the animal with a heavy straw bed, or with blankets if necessary,  if the weather is cold. From five to forty grains of calomel may be given,  depending upon the size of the animal and the frequency of the dose, two or  three times a day. In case the animal is suffering severe pain, morphine  given hypodermically may be indicated. In the mild form and at the very  beginning of the attack, linseed oil may be administered to the larger  animals. The dose is about one quart. The smaller animals may be given  castor oil in from one- to four-ounce doses.    When convalescence is reached the animal should be fed very carefully, as  the digestive tract is not in condition to digest heavy rations or feeds  that ferment readily.    DIARRHOEA.--Diarrhoea occurs as a symptom of irritation and inflammation of  the intestinal mucous membrane. Sudden changes in the feed, the feeding of  a succulent green ration, severe exercise when the animal is not in  condition for it, and chronic indigestion may cause diarrhoea in the  absence of an intestinal inflammation.    _The following symptoms_ may be noted: Animals affected by a diarrhoea act  dull and weak; thirst is increased and the animal may show evidence of  fever; the intestinal evacuations are soft, thin, and sometimes have an  offensive odor. If the diarrhoea continues for several days, the animal  loses flesh rapidly and the appetite is irregular. In such cases weakness  is a prominent symptom.    Recovery usually occurs when the animal is dieted and rested.    _The treatment_ consists in giving a physic of linseed or castor oil.  Horses and cattle may be given from one-half to one quart of linseed oil;  sheep and hogs from one to four ounces of castor oil.

As Geology is brought in as a hopeful witness by  evolutionists, they are bound by a well-known principle of law, to  accept the statements of their own witness even though fatal to their  theory.    For them, Geology furnishes sorry evidence concerning the evolution of  man from the brute. The great scheme of evolution claims as its chief  support four geologic \"finds.\" We can not be certain that any one of  these has the slightest evidential value. An ardent evolutionist, Dr.  Dubois, found a few bones, part ape, part human, buried in the river  _sands_, 40 feet deep. They were scattered 50 feet apart, no two  joined together. They called this strange creature pithecanthropus,  and fixed its age at 750,000 years; others reduced it to 375,000  years. These few bones are no doubt from a modern ape and modern man.    The Heidelberg Jaw was also found _in the sand_, and is guessed  to be 700,000 years old. It is hard to be respectful while they  gravely tell such stories. But the next is even worse: The Piltdown  man, alias the Piltdown fake, fabricated out of a few bones of a man  and a few of an ape. It is rejected as a fabrication even by many  evolutionists.      The Neanderthal man lived, they say, about 50,000 years ago. A part of  a skull was found in a cave.    All the bones purporting to belong to these four creatures would not  together make one complete skeleton, or even one complete skull. A  child could carry all this \"evidence\" in a basket. These skulls can be  duplicated by abnormal skulls in many graveyards today. Scientists are  not certain they belong to the same individual. Part ape, part  human. A desperate effort to get convincing evidence, where there is  none. We can not be certain they lived in the age claimed. Scientists,  even evolutionists, differ widely.    In contrast to this scant and uncertain evidence, Ales Hrdlicka, of  the Smithsonian Institution, speaking of a single locality, says, \"Near  Lyons, France, the skeletons of 200,000 prehistoric horses are  scattered. In one cave in Moravia, there are enough mammoth teeth to  fill a small sized hall.... From the Heidelberg man, there is  practically no record for about 200,000 years. The kinship of the  Piltdown Java and Heidelberg man _is open to dispute_.  The  Neanderthal man may not have been a direct ancestor, of the species  which produced Shakespeare, Napoleon and Newton.\" Remains of the  unchanged ape are abundant.  But the alleged human remains are scanty  and uncertain.'  Now if there were millions and billions of human  beings developing from the brutes, should we not expect as many  remains as of horses and mammoths and apes? We do not have millions of  them, simply because they did not exist. Is not this well nigh a  demonstration?    Shall we, upon this scant and uncertain evidence, accept a theory that  shocks the reason and the moral sense of mankind, and which leads  naturally to infidelity and atheism, and takes away even our hope of  immortality?  Later in this volume we will consider more fully the  alleged proofs from these geologic \"finds.\"    Prof. Charles Lyell said: \"In the year 1806, the French Institute  enumerated not less than 80 geological theories which were hostile to  the Scriptures; but not one of these theories is held today.\"    Many have come to the hasty conclusion that there was a continuous  elaboration or a progressive growth among all species. True in some  cases, but by no means universal.  Many species have remained stable  for millions of years; many have retrograded and deteriorated. Indeed,  some evolutionists claim man has retrograded.    Many species of animals have been larger than their modern  descendants. Many species show no change. All the bacilli remain the  same microscopic species, even those too microscopic to be seen or  isolated. They multiply the same, and produce the same diseases. How  can there be growth in the microscopic world either animal or  vegetable?  The doctrine that there is a development and a growth  among all species of animals or plants, is contradicted by the  facts. If that doctrine were true, there would be no lower order of  animals after so many millions of years of growth. All would have been  large and of a high order like others. Since we find a majority of all  animal species less in size than the fly, there has been little growth  in most species, and in many, none at all. The amoebae, one celled  animals, smaller than a small pin-head, have existed unchanged since  life began. If plants and animals all developed from a one-celled  animal, such as the amoeba, why did not the amoeba develop? Or, if  some developed, why not all? Certainly there would not remain a great  multitude of species in the microscopic world.    Of many species small and large, we have many fossils preserved but  _no transitional forms_. The archæopteryx, a bird with a  feathered tail, is the only alleged transitional form between the  reptiles and the birds. Only two specimens of this same animal have  been found. This could easily be an exceptional species of created  birds differing no more from the normal bird than the ostrich or  humming bird. If there were transitional forms we ought to have them  by the millions. No transitional forms have been found between  reptiles and mammals; and we have seen that there are no reliable  forms between man and mammals. The numerous missing links make a chain  impossible.  Evolution is not simply growth or change, but the  development of all species from one germ.        12. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION      Geographical Distribution, another witness claimed by the  evolutionists, bears testimony, which they are bound, in law, to  receive.    We find animals whose power of locomotion is very limited, scattered  all over the world, like the mollusca and crustacea, embracing a large  number of families, genera, and species. It is incredible that these  all originated in one place, and from one germ, and migrated to  distant parts of the world. The oyster, for example, is found in  Europe, Africa, North and South America. There are over 200 species,  found in all warm tempered climates, but none in the coldest  regions. How could they cross the ocean and be distributed along all  continents? They are soon attached to solid rocks, or other supports,  and do not move at all. And if they do, how could they cross thousands  of miles of ocean barren of all food?    Dr. George W. Field, an expert authority, says the oysters of Europe  are unisexual, but in America, they are double-sexed. How could one be  derived from the other?  Even the oyster is too much for the  evolutionist. The same argument applies to a great multitude of  species, that have little or no powers of locomotion.    If all plants and animals originated from one germ in one place, how  can plants, indigenous to a single continent, or hemisphere, be  accounted for? Why, for example, was there no maize, or Indian corn,  in the old world? Or tomatoes, potatoes, or any other plants  indigenous to America?  If these once existed in the old world, as  they must have done, according to the theory, why were they found in  America alone?    Here we quote from Prof. Agassiz, one of the greatest authorities the  world ever knew: \"I will, therefore, consider the transmutation theory  of species as a _scientific mistake, untrue in its facts,  unscientific in its method, and mischievous in its tendency.\" (Italics  ours and yours)._        13. GOD NOT ABSENT NOR INACTIVE      The theory that God is absent or inactive is as untenable and  God-dishonoring as the discarded theory of atheism itself.    Evolution, as held by many, harmonizes with and supports the false and  impossible assumption that God created one, or at most, a few germs,  from which all animal species including man, and plants developed, by  \"natural law.\" This theory seems plausible to those who do not examine  it too closely. It does not deny the existence of God, and concedes he  may have created one or more germs, but delegated the development of  an orderly world to \"natural law.\" Thus his activities are no longer  needed.  Perhaps they entertain the thought that God must grow weary  under the active and sleepless control of the universe, if not of the  world alone. They lose sight of the fact that a God of infinite mind  and power can not be wearied by any possible complications, or any  required amount of energy. Rather, the exercise of unlimited energy is  a source of pleasure and happiness. May we not learn this from the  boundless extent of the universe?  Creation is not a task, but a great  satisfaction. If God finds so much happiness in creating a boundless  universe, would he renounce the pleasure of the active care and  control of 3,000,000 species?      The hypothesis that God delegates to \"law\" the evolution of the  universe, the world, and all species, is untenable, because no law,  human or divine, can enforce itself.  Law has no power. It is not a  being, a creature, a living thing. It is absolutely helpless. It can  not be God's agent to carry out his will. Why the need of it? Why  should not God use his power direct to do his will? What gain in  creating and employing an agent? Which would be easier, to execute his  own will, or delegate it to a law?    His law is simply the record of his acts. He executes his own will  with exact regularity. He does not vary.  Hence, all his creatures may  depend on regularity. It seems like law. The power in every case is  the power of God. Law has no power. The law of gravitation has no  power. Matter has no power. One of the primary "]]]
