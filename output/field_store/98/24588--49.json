Then you can resume your search here for a master.\"    Amar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention  of returning to Hardwar with me. He was enjoying the familial  warmth.  But I knew I would never abandon the quest for my guru.    Our party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant  response to my prayers.    A clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me  at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to ask a certain scriptural  authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his son had  promised to undertake my dissuasion from the path of a SANNYASI.  {FN4-1}    Ananta took me to their home. The son, a young man of ebullient  manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He engaged me in a lengthy  philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant knowledge  of my future, he discountenanced my idea of being a monk.    \"You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to find God, if  you insist on deserting your ordinary responsibilities! You cannot  work out your past karma {FN4-2} without worldly experiences.\"    Krishna's immortal words rose to my lips in reply: \"'Even he with  the worst of karma who ceaselessly meditates on Me quickly loses  the effects of his past bad actions. Becoming a high-souled being,  he soon attains perennial peace. Arjuna, know this for certain:  the devotee who puts his trust in Me never perishes!'\" {FN4-3}    But the forceful prognostications of the young man had slightly  shaken my confidence. With all the fervor of my heart I prayed  silently to God:    \"Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, right here and now, if  Thou dost desire me to lead the life of a renunciate or a worldly  man!\"    I noticed a SADHU of noble countenance standing just outside  the compound of the pundit's house. Evidently he had overheard  the spirited conversation between the self-styled clairvoyant and  myself, for the stranger called me to his side. I felt a tremendous  power flowing from his calm eyes.    \"Son, don't listen to that ignoramus. In response to your prayer,  the Lord tells me to assure you that your sole path in this life  is that of the renunciate.\"    With astonishment as well as gratitude, I smiled happily at this  decisive message.    \"Come away from that man!\" The \"ignoramus\" was calling me from the  courtyard. My saintly guide raised his hand in blessing and slowly  departed.    \"That SADHU is just as crazy as you are.\" It was the hoary-headed  pundit who made this charming observation. He and his son were  gazing at me lugubriously. \"I heard that he too has left his home  in a vague search for God.\"    I turned away. To Ananta I remarked that I would not engage in  further discussion with our hosts. My brother agreed to an immediate  departure; we soon entrained for Calcutta.    [Illustration: I stand behind my elder brother, Ananta.--see  ananta.jpg]    [Illustration: Last Solstice Festival celebrated by Sri Yukteswar,  December, 1935. My Guru is seated in the center; I am at his  right, in the large courtyard of his hermitage in Serampore.--see  festival.jpg]    \"Mr. Detective, how did you discover I had fled with two companions?\"  I vented my lively curiosity to Ananta during our homeward journey.  He smiled mischievously.    \"At your school, I found that Amar had left his classroom and had  not returned. I went to his home the next morning and unearthed a  marked timetable. Amar's father was just leaving by carriage and  was talking to the coachman.    \"'My son will not ride with me to his school this morning. He has  disappeared!' the father moaned.    \"'I heard from a brother coachman that your son and two others,  dressed in European suits, boarded the train at Howrah Station,'  the man stated. 'They made a present of their leather shoes to the  cab driver.'    \"Thus I had three clues-the timetable, the trio of boys, and the  English clothing.\"    I was listening to Ananta's disclosures with mingled mirth and  vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had been slightly misplaced!    \"Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all  the cities which Amar had underlined in the timetable. He had checked  Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there. After inquiries  in our Calcutta neighborhood, I learned that cousin Jatinda had  been absent one night but had arrived home the following morning  in European garb.  I sought him out and invited him to dinner. He  accepted, quite disarmed by my friendly manner. On the way I led him  unsuspectingly to a police station. He was surrounded by several  officers whom I had previously selected for their ferocious  appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda agreed to account  for his mysterious conduct.    \"'I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant spiritual mood,' he  explained. 'Inspiration filled me at the prospect of meeting the  masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, \"During our ecstasies in the  Himalayan caves, tigers will be spellbound and sit around us like  tame pussies,\" my spirits froze; beads of perspiration formed on  my brow.  \"What then?\" I thought. \"If the vicious nature of the  tigers be not changed through the power of our spiritual trance,  shall they treat us with the kindness of house cats?\" In my mind's  eye, I already saw myself the compulsory inmate of some tiger's  stomach-entering there not at once with the whole body, but by  installments of its several parts!'\"    My anger at Jatinda's vanishment was evaporated in laughter. The  hilarious sequel on the train was worth all the anguish he had  caused me. I must confess to a slight feeling of satisfaction:  Jatinda too had not escaped an encounter with the police!    \"Ananta, {FN4-4} you are a born sleuthhound!\" My glance of amusement  was not without some exasperation. \"And I shall tell Jatinda I am  glad he was prompted by no mood of treachery, as it appeared, but  only by the prudent instinct of self-preservation!\"    At home in Calcutta, Father touchingly requested me to curb my roving  feet until, at least, the completion of my high school studies.  In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for  a saintly pundit, Swami Kebalananda, {FN4-5} to come regularly to  the house.    \"The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor,\" my parent announced  confidently.    Father hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions  from a learned philosopher. But the tables were subtly turned: my  new teacher, far from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the  embers of my God-aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda  was an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The peerless guru had  possessed thousands of disciples, silently drawn to him by the  irresistibility of his divine magnetism. I learned later that Lahiri  Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as RISHI or illumined  sage.    Luxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark eyes were  guileless, with the transparency of a child's. All the movements of  his slight body were marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle  and loving, he was firmly established in the infinite consciousness.  Many of our happy hours together were spent in deep KRIYA meditation.    Kebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient SHASTRAS or sacred  books: his erudition had earned him the title of \"Shastri Mahasaya,\"  by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit  scholarship was unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake  prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor  obliged me one day by telling me something of his own life with  the master.    \"Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for  ten years. His Benares home was my nightly goal of pilgrimage. The  guru was always present in a small front parlor on the first floor.  As he sat in lotus posture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples  garlanded him in a semicircle. His eyes sparkled and danced with  the joy of the Divine. They were ever half closed, peering through  the inner telescopic orb into a sphere of eternal bliss. He seldom  spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze would focus on a student in  need of help; healing words poured then like an avalanche of light.    \"An indescribable peace blossomed within me at the master's glance.  I was permeated with his fragrance, as though from a lotus of  infinity.  To be with him, even without exchanging a word for days,  was experience which changed my entire being. If any invisible  barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I would meditate at  the guru's feet. There the most tenuous states came easily within  my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in the presence of lesser  teachers. The master was a living temple of God whose secret doors  were open to all disciples through devotion.    \"Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpreter of the scriptures.  Effortlessly he dipped into the 'divine library.' Foam of words and  spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He  had the wondrous clavis which unlocked the profound philosophical  science embedded ages ago in the VEDAS. {FN4-6} If asked to explain  the different planes of consciousness mentioned in the ancient  texts, he would smilingly assent.    \"'I will undergo those states, and presently tell you what I  perceive.' He was thus diametrically unlike the teachers who commit  scripture to memory and then give forth unrealized abstractions.    \"'Please expound the holy stanzas as the meaning occurs to you.'  The taciturn guru often gave this instruction to a near-by disciple.  'I will guide your thoughts, that the right interpretation be  uttered.' In this way many of Lahiri Mahasaya's perceptions came  to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students.    \"The master never counseled slavish belief. 'Words are only shells,'  he said. 'Win conviction of God's presence through your own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#8)"],[1,"and you're going to stay!'    She pitched forward into his arms, and he caught her.    'Oh, Joe! Joe! Joe!' she said. 'Hold me. Don't let me go. Take care of  me.'    And I edged for the door and slipped from the room. I felt weak. The  old bean will stand a certain amount, but this was too much. I groped  my way out into the street and wailed for a taxi.    Gussie called on me at the hotel that night. He curveted into the room  as if he had bought it and the rest of the city.    'Bertie,' he said, 'I feel as if I were dreaming.'    'I wish I could feel like that, old top,' I said, and I took another  glance at a cable that had arrived half an hour ago from Aunt Agatha. I  had been looking at it at intervals ever since.    'Ray and I got back to her flat this evening. Who do you think was  there? The mater! She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby.'    'Yes?'    'He was sitting hand in hand with her.'    'Really?'    'They are going to be married.'    'Exactly.'    'Ray and I are going to be married.'    'I suppose so.'    'Bertie, old man, I feel immense. I look round me, and everything seems  to be absolutely corking. The change in the mater is marvellous. She is  twenty-five years younger. She and old Danby are talking of reviving  \"Fun in a Tea-Shop\", and going out on the road with it.'    I got up.    'Gussie, old top,' I said, 'leave me for a while. I would be alone. I  think I've got brain fever or something.'    'Sorry, old man; perhaps New York doesn't agree with you. When do you  expect to go back to England?'    I looked again at Aunt Agatha's cable.    'With luck,' I said, 'in about ten years.'    When he was gone I took up the cable and read it again.    'What is happening?' it read. 'Shall I come over?'    I sucked a pencil for a while, and then I wrote the reply.    It was not an easy cable to word, but I managed it.    'No,' I wrote, 'stay where you are. Profession overcrowded.'          WILTON'S HOLIDAY      When Jack Wilton first came to Marois Bay, none of us dreamed that he  was a man with a hidden sorrow in his life. There was something about  the man which made the idea absurd, or would have made it absurd if he  himself had not been the authority for the story. He looked so  thoroughly pleased with life and with himself. He was one of those men  whom you instinctively label in your mind as 'strong'. He was so  healthy, so fit, and had such a confident, yet sympathetic, look about  him that you felt directly you saw him that here was the one person you  would have selected as the recipient of that hard-luck story of yours.  You felt that his kindly strength would have been something to lean on.    As a matter of fact, it was by trying to lean on it that Spencer Clay  got hold of the facts of the case; and when young Clay got hold of  anything, Marois Bay at large had it hot and fresh a few hours later;  for Spencer was one of those slack-jawed youths who are  constitutionally incapable of preserving a secret.    Within two hours, then, of Clay's chat with Wilton, everyone in the  place knew that, jolly and hearty as the new-comer might seem, there  was that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply  heroic.    Clay, it seems, who is the worst specimen of self-pitier, had gone to  Wilton, in whom, as a new-comer, he naturally saw a fine fresh  repository for his tales of woe, and had opened with a long yarn of  some misfortune or other. I forget which it was; it might have been any  one of a dozen or so which he had constantly in stock, and it is  immaterial which it was. The point is that, having heard him out very  politely and patiently, Wilton came back at him with a story which  silenced even Clay. Spencer was equal to most things, but even he could  not go on whining about how he had foozled his putting and been snubbed  at the bridge-table, or whatever it was that he was pitying himself  about just then, when a man was telling him the story of a wrecked  life.    'He told me not to let it go any further,' said Clay to everyone he  met, 'but of course it doesn't matter telling you. It is a thing he  doesn't like to have known. He told me because he said there was  something about me that seemed to extract confidences--a kind of  strength, he said. You wouldn't think it to look at him, but his life  is an absolute blank. Absolutely ruined, don't you know. He told me the  whole thing so simply and frankly that it broke me all up. It seems  that he was engaged to be married a few years ago, and on the wedding  morning--absolutely on the wedding morning--the girl was taken suddenly  ill, and--'    'And died?'    'And died. Died in his arms. Absolutely in his arms, old top.'    'What a terrible thing!'    'Absolutely. He's never got over it. You won't let it go any further,  will you old man?'    And off sped Spencer, to tell the tale to someone else.           *       *       *       *       *    Everyone was terribly sorry for Wilton. He was such a good fellow, such  a sportsman, and, above all, so young, that one hated the thought that,  laugh as he might, beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that  awful memory. He seemed so happy, too. It was only in moments of  confidence, in those heart-to-heart talks when men reveal their deeper  feelings, that he ever gave a hint that all was not well with him. As,  for example, when Ellerton, who is always in love with someone, backed  him into a corner one evening and began to tell him the story of his  latest affair, he had hardly begun when such a look of pain came over  Wilton's face that he ceased instantly. He said afterwards that the  sudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like a  bullet, and the manner in which he turned the conversation practically  without pausing from love to a discussion of the best method of getting  out of the bunker at the seventh hole was, in the circumstances, a  triumph of tact.    Marois Bay is a quiet place even in the summer, and the Wilton tragedy  was naturally the subject of much talk. It is a sobering thing to get a  glimpse of the underlying sadness of life like that, and there was a  disposition at first on the part of the community to behave in his  presence in a manner reminiscent of pall-bearers at a funeral. But  things soon adjusted themselves. He was outwardly so cheerful that it  seemed ridiculous for the rest of us to step softly and speak with  hushed voices. After all, when you came to examine it, the thing was  his affair, and it was for him to dictate the lines on which it should  be treated. If he elected to hide his pain under a bright smile and a  laugh like that of a hyena with a more than usually keen sense of  humour, our line was obviously to follow his lead.    We did so; and by degrees the fact that his life was permanently  blighted became almost a legend. At the back of our minds we were aware  of it, but it did not obtrude itself into the affairs of every day. It  was only when someone, forgetting, as Ellerton had done, tried to  enlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the look of  pain in his eyes and the sudden tightening of his lips reminded us that  he still remembered.    Matters had been at this stage for perhaps two weeks when Mary Campbell  arrived.    Sex attraction is so purely a question of the taste of the individual  that the wise man never argues about it. He accepts its vagaries as  part of the human mystery, and leaves it at that. To me there was no  charm whatever about Mary Campbell. It may have been that, at the  moment, I was in love with Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice  Wembley--for at Marois Bay, in the summer, a man who is worth his salt  is more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously--but anyway,  she left me cold. Not one thrill could she awake in me. She was small  and, to my mind, insignificant. Some men said that she had fine eyes.  They seemed to me just ordinary eyes. And her hair was just ordinary  hair. In fact, ordinary was the word that described her.    But from the first it was plain that she seemed wonderful with Wilton,  which was all the more remarkable, seeing that he was the one man of us  all who could have got any girl in Marois Bay that he wanted. When a  man is six foot high, is a combination of Hercules and Apollo, and  plays tennis, golf, and the banjo with almost superhuman vim, his path  with the girls of a summer seaside resort is pretty smooth. But, when  you add to all these things a tragedy like Wilton's, he can only be  described as having a walk-over.    Girls love a tragedy. At least, most girls do. It makes a man  interesting to them. Grace Bates was always going on about how  interesting Wilton was. So was Heloise Miller. So was Clarice Wembley.  But it was not until Mary Campbell came that he displayed any real  enthusiasm at all for the feminine element of Marois Bay. We put it  down to the fact that he could not forget, but the real reason, I now  know, was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links  and in the tennis-court. I suppose a plus two golfer and a Wildingesque  tennis-player, such as Wilton was, does feel like that. Personally, I  think that girls add to the fun of the thing. But then, my handicap is  twelve, and, though I have been playing tennis for many years, I doubt  if I have got my first serve--the fast one--over the net more than half  a dozen times.    But Mary Campbell overcame Wilton's prejudices in twenty-four hours. He  seemed to feel lonely on the links without her, and he positively egged  her to be his partner in the doubles. What Mary thought of him we did  not know. She was one of those inscrutable girls.    And so things went on. If it had not been that I knew Wilton's story, I  should have classed the thing as one of those summer love-affairs to  which the Marois Bay air is so peculiarly conducive. The only reason  why anyone comes away from a summer at Marois Bay unbetrothed is"]]]
