The country, sparsely settled, through which the railroad ran seemed  especially fitted for their guerrilla warfare, to say nothing of the poor  state of the road-bed, which at places actually made the passage  dangerous. Then, too, the cars and engine were cheap and simple affairs,  offering no protection from the bullets of the enemies.    But Jack had no intention of giving up at this stage of the situation, and  Fret concluded to risk a third trip.    The company were anxious for the train to be kept running, but offered no  protection, if it could supply any.    The round trip on this day was made without any shots being fired by the  enemies, though at least twenty bush-raiders were seen drawn up in sight  of the train, as it wound its way through one of the gloomiest spots of  the entire route.    One of the disreputable looking party waved a red cloth on the muzzle of  his short-barreled carbine as they whisked past.    \"Look out for to-morrow,\" said Jack. \"That looks to me like a sort of  warning.\"    It proved that he was not the only one who had his suspicions, for as he  swung himself upon the engine the following morning some one stepped from  out of the motley crowd collected about the station and thrusting a scrap  of paper into his hand instantly disappeared.    As soon as they were fairly on their way Jack smoothed out the crumpled  paper to read in a scrawling hand:    \"Look out for the bush-raiders to-day.\"    The sheet bore no signature or date.    \"Looks like a scare by some one,\" remarked Jack, as he handed the missive  to Fret. \"But there can be no harm in keeping a sharp lookout,\" he  admitted. \"I suppose the trouble has got to begin soon, and it might as  well be to-day as to-morrow.\"    Fret Offut, whose stock of courage was small, turned pale, as he read the  brief message:    \"You ain't going to keep on, Jack?\"    \"What else are we hired for? We should be the laughing stock of the  country if we stopped now.\"    \"But this warning makes it different.\"    \"Not a bit as I can see. We came up here expecting to take our chances,  and as for me it seems the bush-raiders have been very modest in opening  proceedings. It is too late for us to turn back. I--\"    \"No--no! Stop, Jack, and I will get off.\"    \"If you don't get off until I stop you will ride into de la Pama. Now  don't be foolish and let that little piece of paper upset you. It was no  more than we expected. Keep a cool head and stand to your post.    \"It may not be as bad as it threatens. But if you persist in leaving you  can do so when we have made this trip. I don't propose to be left in the  lurch by losing my fireman at a time I cannot afford to let him go.\"    Jack's quiet determination and assurance served to quiet Fret's fears, so  he said nothing further about quitting his duty.    After leaving St. Resa, the train, which was a mixed one, made up of two  passenger coaches and a dozen freight cars, had to stop at irregular  intervals, following which the road ran through a twenty-mile wilderness,  the most of the way rugged in the extreme.    It was during this part of the journey that Jack expected trouble if  anywhere, and as he approached the broken region he kept a sharp watch on  every hand.    Fret, though pale and trembling, kept his post.    \"Give me every pound of steam possible,\" said Jack. \"If we don't go  through Whirlwind Gap flying it will be because the old engine has lost  her cunning.\"    They were now rushing along at a tremendous rate of speed considering the  condition of the track, and the old engine rocked and lurched as if it  would leave the track at any moment. There were but a few passengers  aboard, for only those who were compelled to do so traveled during this  dangerous period.  Jack knew there was a valuable freight behind him, to  say nothing of human lives, and he was determined to get into de la Pama  if it lay in his power.    Thus, with a full realization of the peril of his situation, he was  standing at his post, with one hand on the throttle and the other on the  reversing lever, peering intently ahead, taking in every object as they  sped furiously over the rails, when he suddenly beheld a sight which for a  moment fairly took away his breath.    They were swiftly approaching the foot of a high bluff, upon the top of  which he had discovered a dozen of the bush-raiders looking down upon him.  But they were not the most startling part of what he saw and heard.    As the train dashed madly under the rocky wall, above its terrific thunder  rang a deafening crash, and he saw with horror a huge bowlder coming down  the side of the cliff, directly toward the engine!    It had been loosened from its bed by the bush-raiders, and so well had  they timed their work that it would be impossible for the engine to get  beyond its reach before the rock should fall upon it!    It would be equally hazardous to try and stop the train.    Fret Offut had seen the appalling sight, and with a despairing cry,  feeling that it would be death to remain on the engine, he leaped far out  over the embankment.    \"Fret!\" cried Jack, but no answer came back to the call.    Jack North felt that it was all over with him, but true to the instinct of  his nature, he stood bravely at his post.          Chapter X    A Narrow Escape        With the wild cry of Fret Offut and the exultant yells of the bush-raiders  ringing in his ears above the thunder of the rushing train, Jack North  heard the ominous crash, of the descending bowlder, and saw with a dazed  look its swift approach.    The locomotive, throbbing and panting like a human being in a race for  life, was fairly flying along the winding track.    It all lasted but a moment, the downward rush of the deadly body, the  cries of exultation and despair, the lightning-like passing of the fatal  spot by the engine, and the ordeal was over as quickly as it had come!    The descent of the ponderous missile was swift and sure until a projection  on the side of the cliff was reached, when with a terrific concussion the  bowlder glanced. It suddenly shot outward like a cannon ball, and was  carried fairly over the engine into the gulch below.    Jack witnessed this miraculous movement with breathless eagerness  bordering upon terror.    The huge rock passed so near that it scraped the top of the caboose, and  the current of air it raised swept the boy engineer's cap from his head.    The train had got its length beyond the place before Jack could realize  that he had escaped.    The bush-raiders reminded him of it then, if he needed any further  notification, by a volley of bullets and renewed yells of rage.    Though some of the leaden missiles flew uncomfortably near his head, Jack  was unharmed, and as he was borne on by the iron horse around the next  curve in the track, leaving his enemies out of sight, he offered a prayer  of thankfulness for his providential escape.    Fret, he was certain, must have been killed by his mad leap from the  engine. As much as he would have liked to have gone back and looked for  the youth, he knew such a course would have been the height of folly.  Besides his own life to look after, there were the passengers who had  intrusted themselves to his care.    \"Poor Fret! I could do no good now, and I must remember the others. If you  had only remained on the engine it would have been better for you.\"    To his infinite relief, Jack saw nor heard nothing further of the baffled  bush-raiders, who must have been greatly surprised at the escape of the  train with its rich freight.    At the first station, which was several miles away from the scene of the  outlaws' attack, the young engineer told of the loss of his fireman and  his own narrow escape from death, when an armed squad of men started to  search for the body of the missing youth, and to rout the bush-raiders if  they could be found.    Finding an assistant at this place, Jack finished his run to de la Pama  and then came back to this station, which was known as Resaca.    The relief party had not returned, but Jack was told that a bridge had  been found to be unsafe for the passage of the train, so he could not  reach St Resa that day, while it might be a week before the road would be  in a condition to resume his regular trips. But he was willingly allowed  to start after the relief party with the engine and one car, accompanied  by a dozen armed men.    They were approaching the bridge mentioned, when they met the others  coming back, bearing in their midst the lifeless form of Fret Offut.    Jack immediately stopped to have the body of his associate put on the car,  when he started on the return to Resaca.    The untimely fate of Fret Offut impressed him with the great uncertainty  of life. It was true the other had never been his friend, but now that was  forgotten and he felt a deep regret over the youth's sad end.    The return to Resaca was made in safety. In fact nothing had been seen of  the raiders since the start, and it was uncertain what might be their next  move.    The following day Jack saw that Fret's body was given burial in a little  plot within sight of the low-walled church of this clustered settlement,  he being the only mourner.    \"If I should fall in my hazardous work, I could not expect as much as poor  Fret gets in this land of strangers. The last bond between this wild  country and home seems to be broken. Little did we think of this, Fret,  when we anticipated that South American trip!\"    The last sad duty done for Fret Offut, and finding that the bridge would  not be repaired inside of a week, Jack resolved to take a little outing on  his own account.    He still carried with him the paper so strangely found on Robinson Crusoe  island, and he was determined to make a search for the hidden treasure  which it mentioned.    Accordingly, mounted on a small but sure-footed and faithful pony, with a  supply of provisions, Jack set"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#8)"],[1," the court is attracted by the  guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway  that K. selected by chance.            As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on  the stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows.  \"Next  time I come here,\" he said to himself, \"I must either bring sweets with  me to make them like me or a stick to hit them with.\"  Just before he  reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a  ball had finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces like  grown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if he  were to shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid of  what noise they would make by shouting.            On the first floor, his search began for real.  He still felt  unable to ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a  joiner called Lanz - that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs.  Grubach's nephew, was called Lanz - so that he could ask at every flat  whether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look  into the rooms.  It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible  without further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the  children ran in and out.  Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms  where they also did the cooking.  Many women held babies in one arm and  worked at the stove with the other.   Half grown girls, who seemed to be  dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro.  In  every room, the beds were still in use by people who were ill, or still  asleep, or people stretched out on them in their clothes.  K. knocked at  the flats where the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner  lived there.   It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the  enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from  the bed.  \"The gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here.\"  \"A joiner, called Lanz?\" he would ask from the bed.\"  \"That's right,\" K.  would say, although it was clear that the investigating committee was  not to be found there, and so his task was at an end.  There were many  who thought it must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner and  thought long about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving  a name that had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they asked  neighbours or accompanied K. to a door a long way away where they  thought someone of that sort might live in the back part of the building  or where someone would be who could advise K. better than they could  themselves.  K. eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to  be led all round from floor to floor in this way.  He regretted his  initial plan, which had at first seemed so practical to him.  As he  reached the fifth floor, he decided to give up the search, took his  leave of a friendly, young worker who wanted to lead him on still  further and went down the stairs.  But then the thought of how much time  he was wasting made him cross, he went back again and knocked at the  first door on the fifth floor.  The first thing he saw in the small room  was a large clock on the wall which already showed ten o'clock.  \"Is  there a joiner called Lanz who lives here?\" he asked.  \"Pardon?\" said a  young woman with black, shining eyes who was, at that moment, washing  children's underclothes in a bucket.  She pointed her wet hand towards  the open door of the adjoining room.            K. thought he had stepped into a meeting.  A medium sized, two  windowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people - nobody  paid any attention to the person who had just entered.  Close under its  ceiling it was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and  where the people could only stand bent down with their heads and their  backs touching the ceiling.  K., who found the air too stuffy, stepped  out again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood  what he had said, \"I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz.\"  \"Yes,\" said the woman, \"please go on in.\"  K. would probably not have  followed her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door  handle and said, \"I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else  will be allowed in.\"  \"Very sensible,\" said K., \"but it's too full  already.\"  But then he went back in anyway.  He passed through between  two men who were talking beside the door - one of them held both hands  far out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money,  the other looked him closely in the eyes - and someone took him by the  hand.  It was a small, red-faced youth.  \"Come in, come in,\" he said.  K. let himself be led by him, and it turned out that there was -  surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro - a  narrow passage which may have been the division between two factions;  this idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to the  left and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his  direction, he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech  and their movements only towards members of their own side.  Most of  them were dressed in black, in old, long, formal frock coats that hung  down loosely around them.  These clothes were the only thing that  puzzled  K., as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a  local political meeting.            At the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was a  little table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as  overcrowded as everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of  the podium, sat a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someone  behind him.  This second man was standing with his legs crossed and his  elbows on the backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter.  From time  to time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone.  The youth who was leading K. had some difficulty in reporting to the  man.  He had already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tip-  toe, but without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him.  It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention  to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it  was he quietly said.  Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked  over at K.  \"You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,\"  he said.  K. was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, as  hardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the  right hand side of the hall.  \"You should have been here one hour and  five minutes ago,\" the man now repeated, raising his voice this time,  and quickly looked round the hall beneath him.  The muttering also  became immediately louder and, as the man said nothing more, died away  only gradually.  Now the hall was much quieter than when K. had entered.  Only the people up in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks.  As  far as could be distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze,  they seemed to be less well dressed than those below.  Many of them had  brought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so  that they would not hurt themselves pressed against it.            K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did  not defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said,  \"Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.\"  There followed loud  applause, once more from the right hand side of the hall.  Easy people  to get on your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from  the left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there  was applause from only a few individuals.  He wondered what he could say  to get all of them to support him together or, if that were not  possible, to at least get the support of the others for a while.            \"Yes,\" said the man, \"but I'm now no longer under any obligation  to hear your case\" - there was once more a muttering, but this time it  was misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his  hand and continued - \"I will, however, as an exception, continue with it  today.  But you should never arrive late like this again.  And now, step  forward!\"  Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a  place free for K., and K. stepped up onto it.  He stood pressed closely  against the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that  he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge's  desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it.            The judge, however, paid no attention to that but sat very  comfortably on his chair and, after saying a few words to close his  discussion with the man behind him, reached for a little note book, the  only item on his desk.  It was like an old school exercise book and had  become quite misshapen from much thumbing.  \"Now then,\" said the judge,  thumbing through the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who  knows his facts and said, \"you are a house painter?\"  \"No,\" said K., \"I  am the chief clerk in a large bank.\"  This reply was followed by  laughter among the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty  that K. couldn't stop himself joining in with it.  The people supported  themselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a  serious attack of coughing.  Even some of those in the gallery were  laughing.  The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power  over those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been  done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until  then hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and  bushy over his eyes.            The left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the people  stood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium  listening to what "]]]
