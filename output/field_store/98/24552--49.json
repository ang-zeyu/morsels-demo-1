It is evident that it would have been most attractive to me to inquire  into an object such as this, to decide such a question in conjunction  with a thinker of powerful mind, a man of liberal sympathies, and a heart  imbued with a noble enthusiasm for the weal of humanity. Though so  widely separated by worldly position, it would have been a delightful  surprise to have found your unprejudiced mind arriving at the same result  as my own in the field of ideas. Nevertheless, I think I can not only  excuse, but even justify by solid grounds, my step in resisting this  attractive purpose and in preferring beauty to freedom. I hope that I  shall succeed in convincing you that this matter of art is less foreign  to the needs than to the tastes of our age; nay, that, to arrive at a  solution even in the political problem, the road of aesthetics must be  pursued, because it is through beauty that we arrive at freedom. But I  cannot carry out this proof without my bringing to your remembrance the  principles by which the reason is guided in political legislation.          LETTER III.      Man is not better treated by nature in his first start than her other  works are; so long as he is unable to act for himself as an independent  intelligence she acts for him. But the very fact that constitutes him a  man is that he does not remain stationary, where nature has placed him,  that he can pass with his reason, retracing the steps nature had made him  anticipate, that he can convert the work of necessity into one of free  solution, and elevate physical necessity into a moral law.    When man is raised from his slumber in the senses he feels that he is a  man; he surveys his surroundings and finds that he is in a state. He was  introduced into this state by the power of circumstances, before he could  freely select his own position. But as a moral being he cannot possibly  rest satisfied with a political condition forced upon him by necessity,  and only calculated for that condition; and it would be unfortunate if  this did satisfy him. In many cases man shakes off this blind law of  necessity, by his free spontaneous action, of which among many others we  have an instance, in his ennobling by beauty and suppressing by moral  influence the powerful impulse implanted in him by nature in the passion  of love. Thus, when arrived at maturity, he recovers his childhood by an  artificial process, he founds a state of nature in his ideas, not given  him by any experience, but established by the necessary laws and  conditions of his reason, and he attributes to this ideal condition an  object, an aim, of which he was not cognizant in the actual reality of  nature. He gives himself a choice of which he was not capable before,  and sets to work just as if he were beginning anew, and were exchanging  his original state of bondage for one of complete independence, doing  this with complete insight and of his free decision. He is justified in  regarding this work of political thraldom as non-existing, though a wild  and arbitrary caprice may have founded its work very artfully; though it  may strive to maintain it with great arrogance and encompass it with a  halo of veneration. For the work of blind powers possesses no authority  before which freedom need bow, and all must be made to adapt itself to  the highest end which reason has set up in his personality. It is in  this wise that a people in a state of manhood is justified in exchanging  a condition of thraldom for one of moral freedom.    Now the term natural condition can be applied to every political body  which owes its establishment originally to forces and not to laws, and  such a state contradicts the moral nature of man, because lawfulness can  alone have authority over this. At the same time this natural condition  is quite sufficient for the physical man, who only gives himself laws in  order to get rid of brute force. Moreover, the physical man is a  reality, and the moral man problematical. Therefore when the reason  suppresses the natural condition, as she must if she wishes to substitute  her own, she weighs the real physical man against the problematical moral  man, she weighs the existence of society against a possible, though  morally necessary, ideal of society. She takes from man something which  he really possesses, and without which he possesses nothing, and refers  him as a substitute to something that he ought to possess and might  possess; and if reason had relied too exclusively on him she might, in  order to secure him a state of humanity in which he is wanting and can  want without injury to his life, have robbed him even of the means of  animal existence, which is the first necessary condition of his being a  man. Before he had opportunity to hold firm to the law with his will,  reason would have withdrawn from his feet the ladder of nature.    The great point is, therefore, to reconcile these two considerations, to  prevent physical society from ceasing for a moment in time, while the  moral society is being formed in the idea; in other words, to prevent its  existence from being placed in jeopardy for the sake of the moral dignity  of man. When the mechanic has to mend a watch he lets the wheels run  out; but the living watchworks of the state have to be repaired while  they act, and a wheel has to be exchanged for another during its  revolutions. Accordingly props must be sought for to support society and  keep it going while it is made independent of the natural condition from  which it is sought to emancipate it.    This prop is not found in the natural character of man, who, being  selfish and violent, directs his energies rather to the destruction than  to the preservation of society. Nor is it found in his moral character,  which has to be formed, which can never be worked upon or calculated on  by the lawgiver, because it is free and never appears. It would seem,  therefore, that another measure must be adopted. It would seem that the  physical character of the arbitrary must be separated from moral freedom;  that it is incumbent to make the former harmonize with the laws and the  latter dependent on impressions; it would be expedient to remove the  former still farther from matter and to bring the latter somewhat more  near to it; in short, to produce a third character related to both the  others--the physical and the moral--paving the way to a transition from  the sway of mere force to that of law, without preventing the proper  development of the moral character, but serving rather as a pledge in the  sensuous sphere of a morality in the unseen.          LETTER IV.      Thus much is certain. It is only when a third character, as previously  suggested, has preponderance that a revolution in a state according to  moral principles can be free from injurious consequences; nor can  anything else secure its endurance. In proposing or setting up a moral  state, the moral law is relied upon as a real power, and free-will is  drawn into the realm of causes, where all hangs together mutually with  stringent necessity and rigidity. But we know that the condition of the  human will always remains contingent, and that only in the Absolute Being  physical coexists with moral necessity. Accordingly, if it is wished to  depend on the moral conduct of man as on natural results, this conduct  must become nature, and he must be led by natural impulse to such a  course of action as can only and invariably have moral results. But the  will of man is perfectly free between inclination and duty, and no  physical necessity ought to enter as a sharer in this magisterial  personality. If, therefore, he is to retain this power of solution, and  yet become a reliable link in the causal concatenation of forces, this  can only be effected when the operations of both these impulses are  presented quite equally in the world of appearances. It is only possible  when, with every difference of form, the matter of man's volition remains  the same, when all his impulses agreeing with his reason are sufficient  to have the value of a universal legislation.    It may be urged that every individual man carries within himself, at  least in his adaptation and destination, a purely ideal man. The great  problem of his existence is to bring all the incessant changes of his  outer life into conformity with the unchanging unity of this ideal. This  pure ideal man, which makes itself known more or less clearly in every  subject, is represented by the state, which is the objective, and, so to  speak, canonical form in which the manifold differences of the subjects  strive to unite. Now two ways present themselves to the thought in which  the man of time can agree with the man of idea, and there are also two  ways in which the state can maintain itself in individuals. One of these  ways is when the pure ideal man subdues the empirical man, and the state  suppresses the individual, or again when the individual becomes the  state, and the man of time is ennobled to the man of idea.    I admit that in a one-sided estimate from the point of view of morality  this difference vanishes, for the reason is satisfied if her law prevails  unconditionally. But when the survey taken is complete and embraces the  whole man (anthropology), where the form is considered together with the  substance, and a living feeling has a voice, the difference will become  far more evident. No doubt the reason demands unity, and nature variety,  and both legislations take man in hand. The law of the former is stamped  upon him by an incorruptible consciousness, that of the latter by an  ineradicable feeling. Consequently education will always appear  deficient when the moral feeling can only be maintained with the  sacrifice of what is natural; and a political administration will always  be very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#8)"],[1," upon you; but that the  death you die tonight may be doubly bitter, know you that when you  have passed, your widow becomes the wife of Matai Shang, Hekkador  of the Holy Therns, for a Martian year.    \"At the end of that time, as you know, she shall be discarded,  as is the law among us, but not, as is usual, to lead a quiet and  honored life as high priestess of some hallowed shrine.  Instead,  Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, shall become the plaything of  my lieutenants--perhaps of thy most hated enemy, Thurid, the black  dator.\"    As he ceased speaking he awaited in silence evidently for some  outbreak of rage upon my part--something that would have added to  the spice of his revenge.  But I did not give him the satisfaction  that he craved.    Instead, I did the one thing of all others that might rouse his  anger and increase his hatred of me; for I knew that if I died  Dejah Thoris, too, would find a way to die before they could heap  further tortures or indignities upon her.    Of all the holy of holies which the thern venerates and worships  none is more revered than the yellow wig which covers his bald pate,  and next thereto comes the circlet of gold and the great diadem,  whose scintillant rays mark the attainment of the Tenth Cycle.    And, knowing this, I removed the wig and circlet from my head,  tossing them carelessly upon the flagging of the court.  Then I  wiped my feet upon the yellow tresses; and as a groan of rage arose  from the balcony I spat full upon the holy diadem.    Matai Shang went livid with anger, but upon the lips of Thurid I  could see a grim smile of amusement, for to him these things were  not holy; so, lest he should derive too much amusement from my  act, I cried:  \"And thus did I with the holies of Issus, Goddess  of Life Eternal, ere I threw Issus herself to the mob that once  had worshiped her, to be torn to pieces in her own temple.\"    That put an end to Thurid's grinning, for he had been high in the  favor of Issus.    \"Let us have an end to this blaspheming!\" he cried, turning to the  Father of Therns.    Matai Shang rose and, leaning over the edge of the balcony, gave  voice to the weird call that I had heard from the lips of the  priests upon the tiny balcony upon the face of the Golden Cliffs  overlooking the Valley Dor, when, in times past, they called  the fearsome white apes and the hideous plant men to the feast of  victims floating down the broad bosom of the mysterious Iss toward  the silian-infested waters of the Lost Sea of Korus.  \"Let loose  the death!\" he cried, and immediately a dozen doors in the base of  the tower swung open, and a dozen grim and terrible banths sprang  into the arena.    This was not the first time that I had faced the ferocious Barsoomian  lion, but never had I been pitted, single-handed, against a full  dozen of them.  Even with the assistance of the fierce Woola, there  could be but a single outcome to so unequal a struggle.    For a moment the beasts hesitated beneath the brilliant glare  of the torches; but presently their eyes, becoming accustomed to  the light, fell upon Woola and me, and with bristling manes and  deep-throated roars they advanced, lashing their tawny sides with  their powerful tails.    In the brief interval of life that was left me I shot a last,  parting glance toward my Dejah Thoris.  Her beautiful face was set  in an expression of horror; and as my eyes met hers she extended  both arms toward me as, struggling with the guards who now held  her, she endeavored to cast herself from the balcony into the pit  beneath, that she might share my death with me.  Then, as the banths  were about to close upon me, she turned and buried her dear face  in her arms.    Suddenly my attention was drawn toward Thuvia of Ptarth.  The  beautiful girl was leaning far over the edge of the balcony, her  eyes bright with excitement.    In another instant the banths would be upon me, but I could not  force my gaze from the features of the red girl, for I knew that  her expression meant anything but the enjoyment of the grim tragedy  that would so soon be enacted below her; there was some deeper,  hidden meaning which I sought to solve.    For an instant I thought of relying on my earthly muscles and  agility to escape the banths and reach the balcony, which I could  easily have done, but I could not bring myself to desert the  faithful Woola and leave him to die alone beneath the cruel fangs  of the hungry banths; that is not the way upon Barsoom, nor was it  ever the way of John Carter.    Then the secret of Thuvia's excitement became apparent as from her  lips there issued the purring sound I had heard once before; that  time that, within the Golden Cliffs, she called the fierce banths  about her and led them as a shepherdess might lead her flock of  meek and harmless sheep.    At the first note of that soothing sound the banths halted in their  tracks, and every fierce head went high as the beasts sought the  origin of the familiar call.  Presently they discovered the red  girl in the balcony above them, and, turning, roared out their  recognition and their greeting.    Guards sprang to drag Thuvia away, but ere they had succeeded she  had hurled a volley of commands at the listening brutes, and as  one they turned and marched back into their dens.    \"You need not fear them now, John Carter!\" cried Thuvia, before  they could silence her.  \"Those banths will never harm you now,  nor Woola, either.\"    It was all I cared to know.  There was naught to keep me from that  balcony now, and with a long, running leap I sprang far aloft until  my hands grasped its lowest sill.    In an instant all was wild confusion.  Matai Shang shrank back.  Thurid sprang forward with drawn sword to cut me down.    Again Dejah Thoris wielded her heavy irons and fought him back.  Then Matai Shang grasped her about the waist and dragged her away  through a door leading within the tower.    For an instant Thurid hesitated, and then, as though fearing that  the Father of Therns would escape him with the Princess of Helium,  he, too, dashed from the balcony in their wake.    Phaidor alone retained her presence of mind.  Two of the guards she  ordered to bear away Thuvia of Ptarth; the others she commanded to  remain and prevent me from following.  Then she turned toward me.    \"John Carter,\" she cried, \"for the last time I offer you the love  of Phaidor, daughter of the Holy Hekkador.  Accept and your princess  shall be returned to the court of her grandfather, and you shall  live in peace and happiness.  Refuse and the fate that my father  has threatened shall fall upon Dejah Thoris.    \"You cannot save her now, for by this time they have reached a  place where even you may not follow.  Refuse and naught can save  you; for, though the way to the last stronghold of the Holy Therns  was made easy for you, the way hence hath been made impossible.  What say you?\"    \"You knew my answer, Phaidor,\" I replied, \"before ever you spoke.  Make way,\" I cried to the guards, \"for John Carter, Prince of  Helium, would pass!\"    With that I leaped over the low baluster that surrounded the balcony,  and with drawn long-sword faced my enemies.    There were three of them; but Phaidor must have guessed what the  outcome of the battle would be, for she turned and fled from the  balcony the moment she saw that I would have none of her proposition.    The three guardsmen did not wait for my attack.  Instead, they  rushed me--the three of them simultaneously; and it was that which  gave me an advantage, for they fouled one another in the narrow  precincts of the balcony, so that the foremost of them stumbled  full upon my blade at the first onslaught.    The red stain upon my point roused to its full the old blood-lust  of the fighting man that has ever been so strong within my breast,  so that my blade flew through the air with a swiftness and deadly  accuracy that threw the two remaining therns into wild despair.    When at last the sharp steel found the heart of one of them the  other turned to flee, and, guessing that his steps would lead him  along the way taken by those I sought, I let him keep ever far  enough ahead to think that he was safely escaping my sword.    Through several inner chambers he raced until he came to a spiral  runway.  Up this he dashed, I in close pursuit.  At the upper end  we came out into a small chamber, the walls of which were blank  except for a single window overlooking the slopes of Otz and the  Valley of Lost Souls beyond.    Here the fellow tore frantically at what appeared to be but a  piece of the blank wall opposite the single window.  In an instant  I guessed that it was a secret exit from the room, and so I paused  that he might have an opportunity to negotiate it, for I cared  nothing to take the life of this poor servitor--all I craved was  a clear road in pursuit of Dejah Thoris, my long-lost princess.    But, try as he would, the panel would yield neither to cunning nor  force, so that eventually he gave it up and turned to face me.    \"Go thy way, Thern,\" I said to him, pointing toward the entrance  to the runway up which we had but just come.  \"I have no quarrel  with you, nor do I crave your life.  Go!\"    For answer he sprang upon me with his sword, and so suddenly, at  that, that I was like to have gone down before his first rush.  So  there was nothing for it but to give him what he sought, and that  as quickly as might be, that I might not be delayed too long in  this chamber while Matai Shang and Thurid made way with Dejah Thoris  and Thuvia of Ptarth.    The fellow was a clever swordsman--resourceful and extremely  tricky.  In fact, he seemed never to have heard that there existed  such a thing as a code of honor, for he repeatedly outraged a dozen  Barsoomian fighting customs that an honorable man would rather die  than ignore.    He even went so far as to snatch his holy wig from his head and  throw it in my"]]]
