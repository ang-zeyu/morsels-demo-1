[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#8)"],[1,"the Silent, thou Sun, thou hadst best look to thy  rays!\"    And the young Prince, the relentless rival of the Great King, sped away  upon his fiery steed,--this future Stadtholder who had been but the day  before very uncertainly established in his new power, but for whom the  burghers of the Hague had built a staircase with the bodies of John and  Cornelius, two princes as noble as he in the eyes of God and man.          Chapter 5. The Tulip-fancier and his Neighbour      Whilst the burghers of the Hague were tearing in pieces the bodies of  John and Cornelius de Witt, and whilst William of Orange, after having  made sure that his two antagonists were really dead, was galloping over  the Leyden road, followed by Captain van Deken, whom he found a little  too compassionate to honour him any longer with his confidence, Craeke,  the faithful servant, mounted on a good horse, and little suspecting  what terrible events had taken place since his departure, proceeded  along the high road lined with trees, until he was clear of the town and  the neighbouring villages.    Being once safe, he left his horse at a livery stable in order not  to arouse suspicion, and tranquilly continued his journey on the  canal-boats, which conveyed him by easy stages to Dort, pursuing their  way under skilful guidance by the shortest possible routes through  the windings of the river, which held in its watery embrace so many  enchanting little islands, edged with willows and rushes, and abounding  in luxurious vegetation, whereon flocks of fat sheep browsed in peaceful  sleepiness. Craeke from afar off recognised Dort, the smiling city,  at the foot of a hill dotted with windmills. He saw the fine red brick  houses, mortared in white lines, standing on the edge of the water, and  their balconies, open towards the river, decked out with silk tapestry  embroidered with gold flowers, the wonderful manufacture of India and  China; and near these brilliant stuffs, large lines set to catch the  voracious eels, which are attracted towards the houses by the garbage  thrown every day from the kitchens into the river.    Craeke, standing on the deck of the boat, saw, across the moving sails  of the windmills, on the slope of the hill, the red and pink house which  was the goal of his errand. The outlines of its roof were merging in the  yellow foliage of a curtain of poplar trees, the whole habitation having  for background a dark grove of gigantic elms. The mansion was situated  in such a way that the sun, falling on it as into a funnel, dried up,  warmed, and fertilised the mist which the verdant screen could not  prevent the river wind from carrying there every morning and evening.    Having disembarked unobserved amid the usual bustle of the city,  Craeke at once directed his steps towards the house which we have just  described, and which--white, trim, and tidy, even more cleanly scoured  and more carefully waxed in the hidden corners than in the places which  were exposed to view--enclosed a truly happy mortal.    This happy mortal, rara avis, was Dr. van Baerle, the godson of  Cornelius de Witt. He had inhabited the same house ever since his  childhood, for it was the house in which his father and grandfather, old  established princely merchants of the princely city of Dort, were born.    Mynheer van Baerle the father had amassed in the Indian trade three or  four hundred thousand guilders, which Mynheer van Baerle the son, at the  death of his dear and worthy parents, found still quite new, although  one set of them bore the date of coinage of 1640, and the other that  of 1610, a fact which proved that they were guilders of Van Baerle the  father and of Van Baerle the grandfather; but we will inform the reader  at once that these three or four hundred thousand guilders were only the  pocket money, or sort of purse, for Cornelius van Baerle, the hero of  this story, as his landed property in the province yielded him an income  of about ten thousand guilders a year.    When the worthy citizen, the father of Cornelius, passed from time into  eternity, three months after having buried his wife, who seemed to have  departed first to smooth for him the path of death as she had smoothed  for him the path of life, he said to his son, as he embraced him for the  last time,--    \"Eat, drink, and spend your money, if you wish to know what life really  is, for as to toiling from morn to evening on a wooden stool, or a  leathern chair, in a counting-house or a laboratory, that certainly is  not living. Your time to die will also come; and if you are not then so  fortunate as to have a son, you will let my name grow extinct, and my  guilders, which no one has ever fingered but my father, myself, and  the coiner, will have the surprise of passing to an unknown master. And  least of all, imitate the example of your godfather, Cornelius de Witt,  who has plunged into politics, the most ungrateful of all careers, and  who will certainly come to an untimely end.\"    Having given utterance to this paternal advice, the worthy Mynheer van  Baerle died, to the intense grief of his son Cornelius, who cared very  little for the guilders, and very much for his father.    Cornelius then remained alone in his large house. In vain his godfather  offered to him a place in the public service,--in vain did he try  to give him a taste for glory,--although Cornelius, to gratify his  godfather, did embark with De Ruyter upon \"The Seven Provinces,\" the  flagship of a fleet of one hundred and thirty-nine sail, with which  the famous admiral set out to contend singlehanded against the combined  forces of France and England. When, guided by the pilot Leger, he had  come within musket-shot of the \"Prince,\" with the Duke of York (the  English king's brother) aboard, upon which De Ruyter, his mentor, made  so sharp and well directed an attack that the Duke, perceiving that his  vessel would soon have to strike, made the best of his way aboard the  \"Saint Michael\"; when he had seen the \"Saint Michael,\" riddled and  shattered by the Dutch broadside, drift out of the line; when he had  witnessed the sinking of the \"Earl of Sandwich,\" and the death by fire  or drowning of four hundred sailors; when he realized that the result of  all this destruction--after twenty ships had been blown to pieces, three  thousand men killed and five thousand injured--was that nothing was  decided, that both sides claimed the victory, that the fighting would  soon begin again, and that just one more name, that of Southwold Bay,  had been added to the list of battles; when he had estimated how much  time is lost simply in shutting his eyes and ears by a man who likes  to use his reflective powers even while his fellow creatures are  cannonading one another;--Cornelius bade farewell to De Ruyter, to the  Ruart de Pulten, and to glory, kissed the knees of the Grand Pensionary,  for whom he entertained the deepest veneration, and retired to his house  at Dort, rich in his well-earned repose, his twenty-eight years, an iron  constitution and keen perceptions, and his capital of more than four  hundred thousands of florins and income of ten thousand, convinced that  a man is always endowed by Heaven with too much for his own happiness,  and just enough to make him miserable.    Consequently, and to indulge his own idea of happiness, Cornelius began  to be interested in the study of plants and insects, collected and  classified the Flora of all the Dutch islands, arranged the whole  entomology of the province, on which he wrote a treatise, with plates  drawn by his own hands; and at last, being at a loss what to do with  his time, and especially with his money, which went on accumulating at a  most alarming rate, he took it into his head to select for himself, from  all the follies of his country and of his age, one of the most elegant  and expensive,--he became a tulip-fancier.    It was the time when the Dutch and the Portuguese, rivalling each other  in this branch of horticulture, had begun to worship that flower, and  to make more of a cult of it than ever naturalists dared to make of the  human race for fear of arousing the jealousy of God.    Soon people from Dort to Mons began to talk of Mynheer van Baerle's  tulips; and his beds, pits, drying-rooms, and drawers of bulbs  were visited, as the galleries and libraries of Alexandria were by  illustrious Roman travellers.    Van Baerle began by expending his yearly revenue in laying the  groundwork of his collection, after which he broke in upon his new  guilders to bring it to perfection. His exertions, indeed, were crowned  with a most magnificent result: he produced three new tulips, which he  called the \"Jane,\" after his mother; the \"Van Baerle,\" after his father;  and the \"Cornelius,\" after his godfather; the other names have escaped  us, but the fanciers will be sure to find them in the catalogues of the  times.    In the beginning of the year 1672, Cornelius de Witt came to Dort for  three months, to live at his old family mansion; for not only was he  born in that city, but his family had been resident there for centuries.    Cornelius, at that period, as William of Orange said, began to enjoy the  most perfect unpopularity. To his fellow citizens, the good burghers of  Dort, however, he did not appear in the light of a criminal who deserved  to be hung. It is true, they did not particularly like his somewhat  austere republicanism, but they were proud of his valour; and when he  made his entrance into their town, the cup of honour was offered to him,  readily enough, in the name of the city.    After having thanked his fellow citizens, Cornelius proceeded to his old  paternal house, and gave directions for some repairs, which he wished to  have executed before the arrival of his wife and children; and thence  he wended his way to the house of his godson, who perhaps was the only  person in Dort as yet unacquainted with the presence of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#8)"],[1,"population,  which formed the bulk of the nation. Among the workers Socialist doctrines  were spreading with remarkable rapidity.    The parliamentary activity of the Czechs soon revealed to them how vain  were their hopes that a new era of democracy was dawning in Austria. They  soon found out that in Austria parliamentary institutions were a mere cloak  for absolutism and that all their efforts were doomed to failure.    The Czechs were strongly opposed to the annexation of Bosnia. In 1909  Professor Masaryk gained a world reputation by his courageous defence of  the Yugoslav leaders, who were accused of high treason at Zagreb (Agram).  During the Friedjung trial it was again chiefly due to Professor Masaryk's  efforts that forgeries of the Vienna Foreign Office, intended to discredit  the Yugoslav movement, were exposed and the responsibility for them fixed  on Count Forgach, the Austro-Hungarian minister in Belgrade. Professor  Masaryk clearly saw that Austria aimed at the conquest of the Balkans and  intended at all costs to crush Serbia.    10. In 1911 new elections to the Reichsrat took place with the following  result for the Czechs:--    40 Agrarians  25 Social Democrats  14 Young Czechs  13 National Socialists  7  Radicals  7  Clericals  1  Old Czech  1  Socialist (Centralist).    The Radicals (four Moravian People's Party, two State Right Party, one  Realist) formed a party of independent deputies with Professor Masaryk at  their head. They demanded full independence for Bohemia, some of them  laying greater stress on her historical rights, some on the natural right  of Czecho-Slovaks to liberty.    The whole group of Czech deputies stood in opposition against Vienna with  the exception of Kramar, who tried to imitate the Polish positivist policy  in the hope of obtaining concessions in return. But, as we have already  shown in a previous chapter, Dr. Kramar abandoned this policy even before  the war, when he saw how completely Austria was tied to Germany. The bulk  of the Czech people were, of course, always solidly anti-Austrian. During  the Balkan War the Czechs openly showed their sympathies with their brother  Slavs who were struggling for liberty.    The _Clerical Party_ had comparatively little influence and prestige. All  their deputies (seven) were elected in country districts of Moravia, where  civilisation is comparatively less developed than in Bohemia. In Bohemia  and in the more developed districts of Moravia, people resist the efforts  of the clergy to mix religion with politics. The three million Slovaks in  Hungary, who speak a dialect of Czech and who form with the Czechs a single  Czecho-Slovak nation, had only two deputies (Dr. Blaho and Father Juriga),  and were without any influence in the Budapest Parliament.    11. Although many Czech politicians foresaw that Austria's anti-Serbian  policy in the Balkans and her increasing dependence on Germany must lead to  war, yet on the whole the Czechs were not prepared for this contingency.  The Reichsrat was closed when war broke out, and the Diet of Bohemia had  been replaced by an Imperial Commission in 1913. War was declared by  Austria against the will of the Slavs, and yet they did not dare to  protest, as an organised revolution was impossible in view of the presence  of German troops and of the perfect police spy system in Austria. Two  German divisions would have been sufficient to suppress the best organised  revolutionary movement in Bohemia.    The immediate effect of the declaration of war was the unity of the whole  Czech nation. One of the leaders, Professor Masaryk, escaped abroad, and is  at the head of the Czecho-Slovak Government, recognised by the Allies as  the trustee and representative of the Czecho-Slovak nation.    Political activity was of course out of the question until the Reichsrat  reopened on May 30, 1917. Before that date there was an absolute reign of  terror in Bohemia. Some of the leading Czech newspapers were suspended soon  after the outbreak of the war. The few Slovak papers published in Hungary  were suppressed at the same time.    Those newspapers which survived were subject to strict censorship and were  compelled to publish leading articles written by government officials and  supplied to them by the police. Dr. Kramar, one of the most prominent Czech  leaders, his colleague Dr. Rasin, and five National Socialist deputies were  thrown into prison, and some of them even sentenced to death.    The effect of these persecutions was that all the Czecho-Slovaks became  unanimous in their desire to obtain full independence of Austria-Hungary.  Old party differences were forgotten and some of the Czech deputies who had  formerly been opportunist in tendency, such as Dr. Kramar and the Agrarian  ex-minister Prasek, now at last became convinced that all hopes of an  anti-German Austria were futile, that Austria was doomed, as she was a  blind tool in the hands of Germany, and that the only way to prevent the  ten million Czecho-Slovaks from being again exploited in the interests of  German imperialism was to secure their complete independence. On entering  the Reichsrat on May 30, 1917, all the Czech deputies, united in a single  \"Bohemian Union,\" made a unanimous declaration that it was their aim to  work for the union of all Czechs and Slovaks in an independent, democratic  state. To-day Dr. Kramar is in complete agreement with the Radicals who  formerly were his most bitter opponents. In fact four Czech nationalist  parties (the Young Czech, Realist, State Right and Moravian People's  Parties) united in February, 1918, as a single body under the name of \"The  Czech State-Right Democracy.\" The president of its executive is the former  Young Czech leader Dr. Kramar, who was sentenced to death in 1916, but  released in July, 1917. The executive committee of the new party included  all the leaders of the four former parties, namely, Dr. Stransky, Dr.  Herben, M. Dyk, Professor Drtina, and others.    In their proclamation published in the _Narodni Listy_ of February 10,  1918, the executive declared that:        \"The chief aim of the new party will be to engage in a common national      effort for the creation of an independent Bohemian State, the      fundamental territory of which will be composed of the historical and      indivisible crown-lands of Bohemia and of Slovakia. The Bohemian State      will be a democratic state. All its power will come from the people.      And as it will come from the Czech people, it will be just towards all      nationalities, towards all citizens and classes.\"    In a speech to the Young Czech Party before its dissolution, Dr. Kramar  openly declared that \"at the moment of the outbreak of the war it became  quite clear that, despite all tactics of opportunism, our party remained  true to the programme of Czech independence. It became at once evident to  all of us that _the chapter of our former policy was forever closed for  us_. We felt with our whole soul that the Czech nation would not go through  the sufferings of the world war only to renew the pre-war tactics of a slow  progress towards that position to which we have full historical rights as  well as the natural rights of a living and strong nation....\" And again, in  an article in the _Narodni Listy_ of December 25, 1917, Kramar wrote under  the heading \"By Order of the Nation\":        \"We have sought with utmost sacrifice to find a compromise between our      just claims and the international situation which was unfavourable to      us. The war has completely changed all our policy, removing the      possibility of a compromise to which we might have been disposed, and      we cannot once more roll up our flag now so proudly unfurled, and put      it aside for the next occasion.\"    As we shall show also later on, there is not the least doubt that the  necessity for the independence of Bohemia was proclaimed not by a few  extremists, but by all the Czech parties with the approval of the  entire nation.    When Kramar in 1917 again took over the leadership of the Young Czech  Party, which led to the amalgamation of four nationalist parties, a change  took place also in the leadership of the Czech Social Democratic Party  which hitherto was in the hands of a few demagogues and defeatists, such as  Smeral, who dominated the majority of the members. The return of the  Socialist Party to its revolutionary traditions and its entire approval of  the Bohemian state right and the national policy of Czecho-Slovak  independence means a complete and absolute consolidation of the whole  Czech nation.    As the Social Democrats became quite loyal to the Czech cause, the National  Socialist Party lost its _raison d'etre_. Owing to the great sufferings of  the working class during the war, it became imbued with Socialist ideas.    On April 1, 1918, the Czech National Socialist Party held its eighth annual  conference in Prague, at which it adopted a resolution endorsing  international Socialism and changing its name to \"The Czech Socialist  Party.\" The conference was attended also by two representatives of the  Czecho-Slav Social Democratic Party, J. Stivin and deputy Nemec. The  National Socialist leader, deputy Klofac, welcomed the representatives of  the Social Democrats \"whom we have for years past been struggling against,  but with whom the trials of this war have united us.\" He declared that his  party accepted the Socialist programme and would join the new Socialist  International. On September 6, 1918, the executive committees of the two  parties elected a joint council. Its object is to work for the  consolidation of the Czech working classes and for the formation of a  united Czech Labour Party, composed of Social Democrats as well as of the  former National Socialists. A similar process of consolidation is taking  place also among the other parties, so that soon there will probably be  only three Czech parties,"]]]
