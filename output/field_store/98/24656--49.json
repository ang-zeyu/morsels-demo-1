[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#8)"],[1,"Eight    Tik-Tok Tackles a Tough Task      While Shaggy and his companions stood huddled in a group at one side,  the Army of Oogaboo was approaching along the pathway, the tramp of  their feet being now and then accompanied by a dismal groan as one of  the officers stepped on a sharp stone or knocked his funnybone against  his neighbor's sword-handle.    Then out from among the trees marched Private Files, bearing the banner  of Oogaboo, which fluttered from a long pole. This pole he stuck in the  ground just in front of the well and then he cried in a loud voice:    \"I hereby conquer this territory in the name of Queen Ann Soforth of  Oogaboo, and all the inhabitants of the land I proclaim her slaves!\"    Some of the officers now stuck their heads out of the bushes and asked:    \"Is the coast clear, Private Files?\"    \"There is no coast here,\" was the reply, \"but all's well.\"    \"I hope there's water in it,\" said General Cone, mustering courage to  advance to the well; but just then he caught a glimpse of Tik-Tok and  Shaggy and at once fell upon his knees, trembling and frightened and  cried out:    \"Mercy, kind enemies! Mercy! Spare us, and we will be your slaves  forever!\"    The other officers, who had now advanced into the clearing, likewise  fell upon their knees and begged for mercy.    Files turned around and, seeing the strangers for the first time,  examined them with much curiosity. Then, discovering that three of the  party were girls, he lifted his cap and made a polite bow.    \"What's all this?\" demanded a harsh voice, as Queen Ann reached the  place and beheld her kneeling army.    \"Permit us to introduce ourselves,\" replied Shaggy, stepping forward.  \"This is Tik-Tok, the Clockwork Man--who works better than some meat  people. And here is Princess Ozga of Roseland, just now unfortunately  exiled from her Kingdom of Roses. I next present Polychrome, a sky  fairy, who lost her Bow by an accident and can't find her way home. The  small girl here is Betsy Bobbin, from some unknown earthly paradise  called Oklahoma, and with her you see Mr. Hank, a mule with a long tail  and a short temper.\"    \"Puh!\" said Ann, scornfully; \"a pretty lot of vagabonds you are,  indeed; all lost or strayed, I suppose, and not worth a Queen's  plundering. I'm sorry I've conquered you.\"    \"But you haven't conquered us yet,\" called Betsy indignantly.    \"No,\" agreed Files, \"that is a fact. But if my officers will kindly  command me to conquer you, I will do so at once, after which we can  stop arguing and converse more at our ease.\"    The officers had by this time risen from their knees and brushed the  dust from their trousers. To them the enemy did not look very fierce,  so the Generals and Colonels and Majors and Captains gained courage to  face them and began strutting in their most haughty manner.    \"You must understand,\" said Ann, \"that I am the Queen of Oogaboo, and  this is my invincible Army. We are busy conquering the world, and since  you seem to be a part of the world, and are obstructing our journey, it  is necessary for us to conquer you--unworthy though you may be of such  high honor.\"    \"That's all right,\" replied Shaggy. \"Conquer us as often as you like.  We don't mind.\"    \"But we won't be anybody's slaves,\" added Betsy, positively.    \"We'll see about that,\" retorted the Queen, angrily. \"Advance, Private  Files, and bind the enemy hand and foot!\"    But Private Files looked at pretty Betsy and fascinating Polychrome and  the beautiful Rose Princess and shook his head.    \"It would be impolite, and I won't do it,\" he asserted.    \"You must!\" cried Ann. \"It is your duty to obey orders.\"    \"I haven't received any orders from my officers,\" objected the Private.    But the Generals now shouted: \"Forward, and bind the prisoners!\" and  the Colonels and Majors and Captains repeated the command, yelling it  as loud as they could.    All this noise annoyed Hank, who had been eyeing the Army of Oogaboo  with strong disfavor. The mule now dashed forward and began backing  upon the officers and kicking fierce and dangerous heels at them. The  attack was so sudden that the officers scattered like dust in a  whirlwind, dropping their swords as they ran and trying to seek refuge  behind the trees and bushes.    Betsy laughed joyously at the comical rout of the \"noble army,\" and  Polychrome danced with glee. But Ann was furious at this ignoble defeat  of her gallant forces by one small mule.    \"Private Files, I command you to do your duty!\" she cried again, and  then she herself ducked to escape the mule's heels--for Hank made no  distinction in favor of a lady who was an open enemy. Betsy grabbed her  champion by the forelock, however, and so held him fast, and when the  officers saw that the mule was restrained from further attacks they  crept fearfully back and picked up their discarded swords.    \"Private Files, seize and bind these prisoners!\" screamed the Queen.    \"No,\" said Files, throwing down his gun and removing the knapsack which  was strapped to his back, \"I resign my position as the Army of Oogaboo.  I enlisted to fight the enemy and become a hero, but if you want some  one to bind harmless girls you will have to hire another Private.\"    Then he walked over to the others and shook hands with Shaggy and  Tik-Tok.    \"Treason!\" shrieked Ann, and all the officers echoed her cry.    \"Nonsense,\" said Files. \"I've the right to resign if I want to.\"    \"Indeed you haven't!\" retorted the Queen. \"If you resign it will break  up my Army, and then I cannot conquer the world.\" She now turned to the  officers and said: \"I must ask you to do me a favor. I know it is  undignified in officers to fight, but unless you immediately capture  Private Files and force him to obey my orders there will be no plunder  for any of us. Also it is likely you will all suffer the pangs of  hunger, and when we meet a powerful foe you are liable to be captured  and made slaves.\"    The prospect of this awful fate so frightened the officers that they  drew their swords and rushed upon Files, who stood beside Shaggy, in a  truly ferocious manner. The next instant, however, they halted and  again fell upon their knees; for there, before them, was the glistening  Love Magnet, held in the hand of the smiling Shaggy Man, and the sight  of this magic talisman at once won the heart of every Oogabooite. Even  Ann saw the Love Magnet, and forgetting all enmity and anger threw  herself upon Shaggy and embraced him lovingly.    Quite disconcerted by this unexpected effect of the Magnet, Shaggy  disengaged himself from the Queen's encircling arms and quickly hid the  talisman in his pocket. The adventurers from Oogaboo were now his firm  friends, and there was no more talk about conquering and binding any of  his party.    \"If you insist on conquering anyone,\" said Shaggy, \"you may march with  me to the underground Kingdom of Ruggedo. To conquer the world, as you  have set out to do, you must conquer everyone under its surface as well  as those upon its surface, and no one in all the world needs conquering  so much as Ruggedo.\"    \"Who is he?\" asked Ann.    \"The Metal Monarch, King of the Nomes.\"    \"Is he rich?\" inquired Major Stockings in an anxious voice.    \"Of course,\" answered Shaggy. \"He owns all the metal that lies  underground--gold, silver, copper, brass and tin. He has an idea he  also owns all the metals above ground, for he says all metal was once a  part of his kingdom. So, by conquering the Metal Monarch, you will win  all the riches in the world.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed General Apple, heaving a deep sigh, \"that would be  plunder worth our while. Let's conquer him, Your Majesty.\"    The Queen looked reproachfully at Files, who was sitting next to the  lovely Princess and whispering in her ear.    \"Alas,\" said Ann, \"I have no longer an Army. I have plenty of brave  officers, indeed, but no private soldier for them to command. Therefore  I cannot conquer Ruggedo and win all his wealth.\"    \"Why don't you make one of your officers the Private?\" asked Shaggy;  but at once every officer began to protest and the Queen of Oogaboo  shook her head as she replied:    \"That is impossible. A private soldier must be a terrible fighter, and  my officers are unable to fight. They are exceptionally brave in  commanding others to fight, but could not themselves meet the enemy and  conquer.\"    \"Very true, Your Majesty,\" said Colonel Plum, eagerly. \"There are many  kinds of bravery and one cannot be expected to possess them all. I  myself am brave as a lion in all ways until it comes to fighting, but  then my nature revolts. Fighting is unkind and liable to be injurious  to others; so, being a gentleman, I never fight.\"    \"Nor I!\" shouted each of the other officers.    \"You see,\" said Ann, \"how helpless I am. Had not Private Files proved  himself a traitor and a deserter, I would gladly have conquered this  Ruggedo; but an Army without a private soldier is like a bee without a  stinger.\"    \"I am not a traitor, Your Majesty,\" protested Files. \"I resigned in a  proper manner, not liking the job. But there are plenty of people to  take my place. Why not make Shaggy Man the private soldier?\"    \"He might be killed,\" said Ann, looking tenderly at Shaggy, \"for he is  mortal, and able to die. If anything happened to him, it would break my  heart.\"    \"It would hurt me worse than that,\" declared Shaggy. \"You must admit,  Your Majesty, that I am commander of this expedition, for it is my  brother we are seeking, rather than plunder. But I and my companions  would like the assistance of your Army, and if you help us to conquer  Ruggedo and to rescue my brother from captivity we will allow you to  keep all the gold and jewels and other plunder you may find.\"    This prospect was so tempting that the officers began whispering  together and presently Colonel Cheese said: \"Your Majesty, by combining  our brains we have just evolved a most brilliant idea."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#8)"],[1," Cap'n Bill picked her up gently with his thumb and one finger and  placed her in the middle of the sunbonnet. Then he placed beside her  the six purple berries--each one being about as big as the tiny Trot's  head--and all preparations being now made the old sailor ate his  lavender berry and became very small--wooden leg and all!    Cap'n Bill stumbled sadly in trying to climb over the edge of the  sunbonnet and pitched in beside Trot headfirst, which caused the  unhappy Pessim to laugh with glee. Then the King of the Island picked  up the sunbonnet--so rudely that he shook its occupants like peas in a  pod--and tied it, by means of its strings, securely around the Ork's  neck.    \"I hope, Trot, you sewed those strings on tight,\" said Cap'n Bill  anxiously.    \"Why, we are not very heavy, you know,\" she replied, \"so I think the  stitches will hold. But be careful and not crush the berries, Cap'n.\"    \"One is jammed already,\" he said, looking at them.    \"All ready?\" asked the Ork.    \"Yes!\" they cried together, and Pessim came close to the sunbonnet and  called out to them: \"You'll be smashed or drowned, I'm sure you will!  But farewell, and good riddance to you.\"    The Ork was provoked by this unkind speech, so he turned his tail  toward the little man and made it revolve so fast that the rush of air  tumbled Pessim over backward and he rolled several times upon the  ground before he could stop himself and sit up. By that time the Ork  was high in the air and speeding swiftly over the ocean.          Chapter Six    The Flight of the Midgets      Cap'n Bill and Trot rode very comfortably in the sunbonnet.  The motion  was quite steady, for they weighed so little that the Ork flew without  effort. Yet they were both somewhat nervous about their future fate and  could not help wishing they were safe on land and their natural size  again.    \"You're terr'ble small, Trot,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, looking at his  companion.    \"Same to you, Cap'n,\" she said with a laugh; \"but as long as we have  the purple berries we needn't worry about our size.\"    \"In a circus,\" mused the old man, \"we'd be curiosities. But in a  sunbonnet--high up in the air--sailin' over a big, unknown ocean--they  ain't no word in any booktionary to describe us.\"    \"Why, we're midgets, that's all,\" said the little girl. The Ork flew  silently for a long time. The slight swaying of the sunbonnet made  Cap'n Bill drowsy, and he began to doze. Trot, however, was wide awake,  and after enduring the monotonous journey as long as she was able she  called out:    \"Don't you see land anywhere, Mr. Ork?\"    \"Not yet,\" he answered. \"This is a big ocean and I've no idea in which  direction the nearest land to that island lies; but if I keep flying in  a straight line I'm sure to reach some place some time.\"    That seemed reasonable, so the little people in the sunbonnet remained  as patient as possible; that is, Cap'n Bill dozed and Trot tried to  remember her geography lessons so she could figure out what land they  were likely to arrive at.    For hours and hours the Ork flew steadily, keeping to the straight line  and searching with his eyes the horizon of the ocean for land. Cap'n  Bill was fast asleep and snoring and Trot had laid her head on his  shoulder to rest it when suddenly the Ork exclaimed:    \"There! I've caught a glimpse of land, at last.\"    At this announcement they roused themselves. Cap'n Bill stood up and  tried to peek over the edge of the sunbonnet.    \"What does it look like?\" he inquired.    \"Looks like another island,\" said the Ork; \"but I can judge it better  in a minute or two.\"    \"I don't care much for islands, since we visited that other one,\"  declared Trot.    Soon the Ork made another announcement.    \"It is surely an island, and a little one, too,\" said he. \"But I won't  stop, because I see a much bigger land straight ahead of it.\"    \"That's right,\" approved Cap'n Bill. \"The bigger the land, the better  it will suit us.\"    \"It's almost a continent,\" continued the Ork after a brief silence,  during which he did not decrease the speed of his flight. \"I wonder if  it can be Orkland, the place I have been seeking so long?\"    \"I hope not,\" whispered Trot to Cap'n Bill--so softly that the Ork  could not hear her--\"for I shouldn't like to be in a country where only  Orks live. This one Ork isn't a bad companion, but a lot of him  wouldn't be much fun.\"    After a few more minutes of flying the Ork called out in a sad voice:    \"No! this is not my country. It's a place I have never seen before,  although I have wandered far and wide. It seems to be all mountains and  deserts and green valleys and queer cities and lakes and rivers--mixed  up in a very puzzling way.\"    \"Most countries are like that,\" commented Cap'n Bill. \"Are you going to  land?\"    \"Pretty soon,\" was the reply. \"There is a mountain peak just ahead of  me. What do you say to our landing on that?\"    \"All right,\" agreed the sailor-man, for both he and Trot were getting  tired of riding in the sunbonnet and longed to set foot on solid ground  again.    So in a few minutes the Ork slowed down his speed and then came to a  stop so easily that they were scarcely jarred at all. Then the creature  squatted down until the sunbonnet rested on the ground, and began  trying to unfasten with its claws the knotted strings.    This proved a very clumsy task, because the strings were tied at the  back of the Ork's neck, just where his claws would not easily reach.  After much fumbling he said:    \"I'm afraid I can't let you out, and there is no one near to help me.\"    This was at first discouraging, but after a little thought Cap'n Bill  said:    \"If you don't mind, Trot, I can cut a slit in your sunbonnet with my  knife.\"    \"Do,\" she replied. \"The slit won't matter, 'cause I can sew it up again  afterward, when I am big.\"    So Cap'n Bill got out his knife, which was just as small, in  proportion, as he was, and after considerable trouble managed to cut a  long slit in the sunbonnet. First he squeezed through the opening  himself and then helped Trot to get out.    When they stood on firm ground again their first act was to begin  eating the dark purple berries which they had brought with them. Two of  these Trot had guarded carefully during the long journey, by holding  them in her lap, for their safety meant much to the tiny people.    \"I'm not very hungry,\" said the little girl as she handed a berry to  Cap'n Bill, \"but hunger doesn't count, in this case. It's like taking  medicine to make you well, so we must manage to eat 'em, somehow or  other.\"    But the berries proved quite pleasant to taste and as Cap'n Bill and  Trot nibbled at their edges their forms began to grow in size--slowly  but steadily. The bigger they grew the easier it was for them to eat  the berries, which of course became smaller to them, and by the time  the fruit was eaten our friends had regained their natural size.    The little girl was greatly relieved when she found herself as large as  she had ever been, and Cap'n Bill shared her satisfaction; for,  although they had seen the effect of the berries on the Ork, they had  not been sure the magic fruit would have the same effect on human  beings, or that the magic would work in any other country than that in  which the berries grew.    \"What shall we do with the other four berries?\" asked Trot, as she  picked up her sunbonnet, marveling that she had ever been small enough  to ride in it. \"They're no good to us now, are they, Cap'n?\"    \"I'm not sure as to that,\" he replied. \"If they were eaten by one who  had never eaten the lavender berries, they might have no effect at all;  but then, contrarywise, they might. One of 'em has got badly jammed, so  I'll throw it away, but the other three I b'lieve I'll carry with me.  They're magic things, you know, and may come handy to us some time.\"    He now searched in his big pockets and drew out a small wooden box with  a sliding cover.  The sailor had kept an assortment of nails, of  various sizes, in this box, but those he now dumped loosely into his  pocket and in the box placed the three sound purple berries.    When this important matter was attended to they found time to look  about them and see what sort of place the Ork had landed them in.          Chapter Seven    The Bumpy Man      The mountain on which they had alighted was not a barren waste, but had  on its sides patches of green grass, some bushes, a few slender trees  and here and there masses of tumbled rocks. The sides of the slope  seemed rather steep, but with care one could climb up or down them with  ease and safety. The view from where they now stood showed pleasant  valleys and fertile hills lying below the heights. Trot thought she saw  some houses of queer shapes scattered about the lower landscape, and  there were moving dots that might be people or animals, yet were too  far away for her to see them clearly.    Not far from the place where they stood was the top of the mountain,  which seemed to be flat, so the Ork proposed to his companions that he  would fly up and see what was there.    \"That's a good idea,\" said Trot, \"'cause it's getting toward evening  and we'll have to find a place to sleep.\"    The Ork had not been gone more than a few minutes when they saw him  appear on the edge of the top which was nearest them.    \"Come on up!\" he called.    So Trot and Cap'n Bill began to ascend the steep slope and it did not  take them long to reach the place where the Ork awaited them.    Their first view of the mountain top pleased them very much. It was a  level space of wider extent than they had guessed and upon it grew  grass of a brilliant green color. In the very center stood a house  built of stone and very neatly constructed. No one was in sight, but  smoke was coming from the chimney, so with one accord all three began  walking toward the house.    \"I wonder,\" said Trot, \"in what country we are, and if it's very"]]]
