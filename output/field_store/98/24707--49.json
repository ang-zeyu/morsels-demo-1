When she looked out over the roofs of the town, there too was  ugliness; and well the houses knew it, for with hideous stucco  they aped in grotesque mimicry the pillars and temples of old  Greece, pretending to one another to be that which they were not.  And emerging from these houses and going in, and seeing the pretence  of paint and stucco year after year until it all peeled away, the  souls of the poor owners of those houses sought to be other souls  until they grew weary of it.    At evening Mary Jane went back to her lodgings.  Only then, after the  dark had fallen, could the soul of Mary Jane perceive any beauty in  that city, when the lamps were lit and here and there a star shone  through the smoke.  Then she would have gone abroad and beheld the  night, but this the old woman to whom she was confided would not let  her do.  And the days multiplied themselves by seven and became  weeks, and the weeks passed by, and all days were the same.  And all  the while the soul of Mary Jane was crying for beautiful things, and  found not one, saving on Sundays, when she went to church, and left  it to find the city greyer than before.    One day she decided that it was better to be a wild thing in the  lovely marshes, than to have a soul that cried for beautiful things  and found not one.  From that day she determined to be rid of her  soul, so she told her story to one of the factory girls, and said to  her:    'The other girls are poorly clad and they do soulless work; surely  some of them have no souls and would take mine.'    But the factory girl said to her: 'All the poor have souls.  It is  all they have.'    Then Mary Jane watched the rich whenever she saw them, and vainly  sought for some one without a soul.    One day at the hour when the  machines rested and the human beings that tended them rested too,  the wind being at that time from the direction of the marshlands,  the soul of Mary Jane lamented bitterly.  Then, as she stood outside  the factory gates, the soul irresistibly compelled her to sing, and  a wild song came from her lips, hymning the marshlands.  And into her  song came crying her yearning for home, and for the sound of the  shout of the North Wind, masterful and proud, with his lovely lady  the Snow; and she sang of tales that the rushes murmured to one  another, tales that the teal knew and the watchful heron.  And over  the crowded streets her song went crying away, the song of waste  places and of wild free lands, full of wonder and magic, for she had  in her elf-made soul the song of the birds and the roar of the organ  in the marshes.    At this moment Signor Thompsoni, the well-known English tenor,  happened to go by with a friend.  They stopped and listened; everyone  stopped and listened.    'There has been nothing like this in Europe in my time,' said Signor  Thompsoni.    So a change came into the life of Mary Jane.    People were written to,  and finally it was arranged that she should take a leading part in  the Covent Garden Opera in a few weeks.    So she went to London to learn.    London and singing lessons were  better than the City of the Midlands and those terrible machines.  Yet still Mary Jane was not free to go and live as she liked by the  edge of the marshlands, and she was still determined to be rid of  her soul, but could find no one that had not a soul of their own.    One day she was told that the English people would not listen to her  as Miss Rush, and was asked what more suitable name she would like  to be called by.    'I would like to be called Terrible North Wind,' said Mary Jane, 'or  Song of the Rushes.'    When she was told that this was impossible and Signorina Maria  Russiano was suggested, she acquiesced at once, as she had  acquiesced when they took her away from her curate; she  knew nothing of the ways of humans.    At last the day of the Opera  came round, and it was a cold day of the winter.    And Signorina Russiano appeared on the stage before a crowded house.    And Signorina Russiano sang.    And into the song went all the longing of her soul, the soul that  could not go to Paradise, but could only worship God and know the  meaning of music, and the longing pervaded that Italian song as the  infinite mystery of the hills is borne along the sound of distant  sheep-bells.  Then in the souls that were in that crowded house arose  little memories of a great while since that were quite quite dead,  and lived awhile again during that marvellous song.    And a strange chill went into the blood of all that listened, as  though they stood on the border of bleak marshes and the North Wind  blew.    And some it moved to sorrow and some to regret, and some to an  unearthly joy,--then suddenly the song went wailing away like the  winds of the winter from the marshlands when Spring appears from the  South.    So it ended.  And a great silence fell fog-like over all that house,  breaking in upon the end of a chatty conversation that Cecilia,  Countess of Birmingham, was enjoying with a friend.    In the dead hush Signorina Russiano rushed  from the stage; she appeared again running among the audience, and  dashed up to Lady Birmingham.    'Take my soul,' she said; 'it is a beautiful soul.  It can worship  God, and knows the meaning of music and can imagine Paradise.  And if  you go to the marshlands with it you will see beautiful things;  there is an old town there built of lovely timbers, with ghosts in  its streets.'    Lady Birmingham stared.  Everyone was standing up.  'See,' said  Signorina Russiano, 'it is a beautiful soul.'    And she clutched at her left  breast a little above the heart, and there was the soul shining in  her hand, with the green and blue lights going round and round and  the purple flare in the midst.    'Take it,' she said, 'and you will love all that is beautiful, and  know the four winds, each one by his name, and the songs of the  birds at dawn.  I do not want it, because I am not free.  Put it to  your left breast a little above the heart.'    Still everybody was  standing up, and Lady Birmingham felt uncomfortable.    'Please offer it to some one else,' she said.    'But they all have souls already,' said Signorina Russiano.    And everybody went on standing up.  And Lady Birmingham took the soul  in her hand.    'Perhaps it is lucky,' she said.    She felt that she wanted to pray.    She half-closed her eyes, and said '_Unberufen_'. Then she put the  soul to her left breast a little above the heart, and hoped that the  people would sit down and the singer go away.    Instantly a heap of clothes collapsed before her.  For a moment, in  the shadow among the seats, those who were born in the dusk hour  might have seen a little brown thing leaping free from the clothes,  then it sprang into the bright light of the hall, and became  invisible to any human eye.    It dashed about for a little, then found the door, and presently was  in the lamplit streets.    To those that were born in the dusk hour it might have been seen  leaping rapidly wherever the streets ran northwards and eastwards,  disappearing from human sight as it passed under the lamps and  appearing again beyond them with a marsh-light over its head.    Once a dog perceived it and gave chase, and was left far behind.    The cats of London, who are all born in the dusk hour, howled  fearfully as it went by.    Presently it came to the meaner streets, where the houses are  smaller.  Then it went due north-eastwards, leaping from roof to roof.  And so in a few minutes it came to more open spaces, and then to the  desolate lands, where market gardens grow, which are neither town  nor country.  Till at last the good black trees came into view, with  their demoniac shapes in the night, and the grass was cold and wet,  and the night-mist floated over it.  And a great white owl came by,  going up and down in the dark.  And at all these things the little  Wild Thing rejoiced elvishly.    And it left London far behind it, reddening the sky, and could  distinguish no longer its unlovely roar, but heard again the noises  of the night.    And now it would come through a hamlet glowing and comfortable in  the night; and now to the dark, wet, open fields again; and many an  owl it overtook as they drifted through the night, a people friendly  to the Elf-folk.  Sometimes it crossed wide rivers, leaping from star  to star; and, choosing its way as it went, to avoid the hard rough  roads, came before midnight to the East Anglian lands.    And it heard  there the shout of the North Wind, who was dominant and angry, as he  drove southwards his adventurous geese; while the rushes bent before  him chaunting plaintively and low, like enslaved rowers of some  fabulous trireme, bending and swinging under blows of the lash, and  singing all the while a doleful song.    And it felt the good dank air that clothes by night the broad East  Anglian lands, and came again to some old perilous pool where the  soft green mosses grew, and there plunged downward and downward into  the dear dark water till it felt the homely ooze once more coming  up between its toes.  Thence, out of the lovely chill that is in the  heart of the ooze, it arose renewed and rejoicing to dance upon the  image of the stars.    I chanced to stand that night by the marsh's edge, forgetting in my  mind the affairs of men; and I saw the marsh-fires come leaping up  from all the perilous places.  And they came up by flocks the whole  night long to the number of a great multitude, and danced away  together over the marshes.    And I believe that there was a great rejoicing all that night among  the kith of the Elf-folk.          The Highwaymen    Tom o' the Roads had ridden his last ride, and was now alone in the  night.

Ex. _Mientras la cencia a descubrir no alcance_, p. 165, IV, l. 13.    (4) When the first word ends in a single vowel, and the second word  begins with a diphthong in a constituent syllable.      Ex. _Tu, proceloso austro que derribas_.    (3) and (4) might well be considered as cases of hiatus.        SYNALEPHA BETWEEN FOUR OR MORE VOWELS      This is less common, yet it exists.      Ex. _No^h^a^y^amor donde no hay celos_. Lope de Vega.          HIATUS    Hiatus is most frequently found between words having a close  syntactical relation, particularly if the initial vowel of the second  word is in a constituent syllable. It may occur between the article  and its substantive, the possessive adjective and its substantive, a  preposition and its object, the negatives _no_ and _ni_ and a  following vowel; and after the conjunctions _y, que, si_, and other  words having a weak accent such as _desde, coma, todo, otro, cuando_,  etc.    Hiatus is most likely to occur when the accented vowel is the initial  vowel of the final word in a phrase or verse, or of a word that has a  strongly accented position in the verse; as, for example, when the  syllable is the next to the last syllable in a verse, or is the fourth  or eighth syllable of a hendecasyllabic verse of the second class.      Ex. _Rumor de besos y batir de alas_, p. 168, X, l. 6.      Ex. _Como la ola que a la playa viene_, p. 178, XXXVII, l. 19.    In the above-mentioned case, the phrase _de^oro_ is usually joined by  synalepha.      Ex. _Mi frente es palida, mis trenzas de^oro._ Becquer.    Hiatus is, however, sometimes observed in this phrase.      Ex. _De plumas y de oro_, p. 180, XL, l. 28.    When both vowels are accented hiatus is more common than synalepha,  even though there is no close syntactical relation, although the  vowels may be joined by synalepha if they do not come in a constituent  syllable.      Ex. _iOh ya isla catolica patente!_ Herrera. [Hiatus.]      Ex. _?Sabes tu^a donde va?_ p. 178, XXXVIII, l. 4. [Synalepha.]        II. RHYTHMIC ACCENT      The second essential element of Spanish verse is a rhythmic  distribution of accents within a line. Words have an accent of their  own and another stronger accent on account of their position in a  verse.    This extraordinary accentual stress, which strengthens periodically  certain naturally accented syllables of a verse, is known as _rhythmic  accent_. It plays somewhat the same role as did quantity in Latin  verse. All other accents and pauses in the verse are subservient to  the rhythmic accent.    Spanish verse being accentual, however, and not quantitative, the  terms used to determine the regular recurrence of long and short  syllables in Latin verse are not very applicable to it, and few  compositions are regular in the arrangement of the stress.      A. LATIN TERMS OF VERSIFICATION APPLIED TO SPANISH VERSE    As Latin terms of versification are sometimes applied to Spanish  verse, the following rules may be helpful.    A _trochaic_ octosyllabic line, for example, substituting stress for  quantity, would be scanned      / -- | / -- | / -- | / --,    with the stress on the first, third, fifth, and seventh syllables.    _Iambic_ verse would have a regular alternation of unaccented and  accented syllables, -- / -- /, etc.    _Dactylic_ verse would have a regular recurrence of an accented  syllable followed by two unaccented syllables, etc.      / -- -- | / -- -- |, etc.    _Amphibrachic_ verse would be formed by a regular recurrence of three  syllables of which the middle one would be stressed, -- / --. This  construction is sometimes followed in lines of twelve syllables (p.  164, I, 1. 2), and also in lines of six syllables (p. 167, VII, 1.-4).    _Anapestic_ verse consists of a regular recurrence of two unstressed  syllables preceding a stressed syllable, -- -- /. This is sometimes  found in ten-syllable lines (p. 164, I, 1. i).      B. SPANISH VERSE ENDINGS    An accented word is called _aguda_ when it has the accent on the last  syllable, e.g. _verdad, luz, yo_; _llana_ (or grave) when it has the  accent on the penult, e.g. _trabajo, fruto_; _esdrujula_ when it has  the accent on the antepenult, e.g. _limpido, pajaro, portico_.    A verse is called _agudo, llano_ (or grave), or _esdrujulo_ according  to whether its final word is _aguda, llana_ (or grave), or  _esdrujula_.    In a _verso agudo_ the last syllable counts for two syllables.  Therefore, _Ni tu ni yo jamas_, p. 177, XXXIII, l. 2, is a  heptasyllable.    In a _verso llano_ (grave) the number of syllables does not change.  Therefore, _Detras del abanico_, p. 180, XL, l. 27, is a  heptasyllable.    In a _verso esdrujulo_, the intermediate syllable between the accented  syllable and the final syllable does not count, either in enumerating  the syllables in the verse or for the rhyme (assonance). Therefore,  _Umbrales de su portico_, p. 180, XL, l. 32, is a heptasyllable.      C. THE DISTRIBUTION OF RHYTHMIC ACCENTS    In verses of different length there are different rules with regard to  the distribution of accents, but the following general rules should be  observed.    Every verse must be accented upon the syllable nominally preceding the  final syllable.    NOTE: It should be borne in mind that the actual final syllable in a  versa _agudo_ counts as two syllables, and that the next to the last  actual syllable in a verso _esdrujulo_ does not count.    Besides the necessary accent on the next to the last syllable, all  verses of seven syllables or more must have other necessary accents,  which are determined by the number of syllables in the line.    The syllable directly preceding the one that has the rhythmical accent  should never be accented, for it obstructs the proper accentuation of  the constituent syllable. A syllable so accented is called  _obstruccionista_.      D. THE NUMBER OF SYLLABLES IN SPANISH VERSE    Spanish verse may consist of any number of syllables from two up to  sixteen. All must have an accent on the next to the last syllable.    _Dissyllabic Verse_: A dissyllabic verse may be composed of a single  word (either _aguda_, _llana_, or _esdrujula_).      Ex. _iDuerme!_ p. 173, XXVII, l. 13.    There can be no supernumerary accents.    _Trisyllabic Verse_: A verse of three syllables can have no  supernumerary accent, for the accent would be _obstruccionista_.      Ex. _Suspira._    _Tetrasyllable Verse_: A verse of four syllables must have an accent  on the third syllable. There may or may not be a supernumerary accent  on the first.      Ex. _De ese brio._    _Pentasyllabic Verse_: A verse of five syllables must have an accent  on the fourth. It may or may not have a supernumerary accent on the  first or second syllable.      Ex. _Rumor sonoro_, p. I 70, XV, l. 3.    _Adonic verse_ is a pentasyllable with necessary accents on the first  and fourth syllables.      Ex. _Cefiro blando_. Villegas.    _Hexasyllabic Verse_: A verse of six syllables must have an accent on  the fifth. There may or may not be supernumerary accents, but never on  the fourth syllable.                           5    Ex. _Y^entre^aquella sombra          2         5        Veiase^a^intervalos             3     5        Dibujarse rigida            2          5        La forma del cuerpo_, p. 188, LXXIII, ll. 13-16.    _Heptasyllabic Verse_: A verse of seven syllables must have an accent  on the sixth, and at least one other necessary accent, which may be on  any syllable except the fifth.           2               6    Ex. _Su mano^entre mis manos,            2           6        Sus ojos en mis ojos_, p. 179, XL, ll. 1-2.    _Octosyllabic Verse_: A verse of eight syllables must have an accent  on the seventh, and at least one other accent, which may fall on any  syllable except the sixth.               1        4       7    Ex. _Hojas del arbol caidas            2         5     7        Juguetes al viento son._ Espronceda.    _Hendecasyllabic verse_: There are two classes of hendecasyllables.    _First Class_: Verses of eleven syllables which have the sixth  syllable and the tenth syllable stressed are hendecasyllables of the  first class.      Ex. _Los invisibles 'atomos del 'aire_, p. 168, X, l. 1.    Hendecasyllables of the first class may have supernumerary accents on  other syllables, provided they do not fall upon the fifth or ninth.      Ex. _Los sus'pires son 'aire, y van al 'aire.        Las 'lagrimas son 'agua, y van al 'mar._ p. 178, XXXVIII, ll.        1-2.    _Second Class_: Hendecasyllables of the second class are  eleven-syllable verses with the accent on the fourth, eighth, and  tenth syllables. There may be accents on other syllables, provided  that they be not _obstruccionistas_.      Ex. _Olas gi'gantes qu^e^os rom'peis bra'mando,_ p. 183, LII, l. 1.    If it is difficult to classify a hendecasyllable because it has  accents on the fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth syllables, one must  decide on the prominence of the accents from pauses, or from emphasis.  The hendecasyllable,      _La vida es 'corta, 'si; muy 'largo el 'arte,_    would belong to the first class on account of the emphasis of _si_,  while the verse,      _La vida es 'corta, 'corta; 'largo el 'arte,_    would belong to the second class on account of the pause after the  fourth and the emphasis on the eighth. The accent on the sixth is,  then, not constituent, but supernumerary.    All meters thus far have    Obligatory (constituent) accents.    Facultative (supernumerary) accents.    A necessary termination in a combination of an unaccented plus an  accented plus an unaccented syllable (-- / --). The dissyllable is the  only exception.    The facultative accent is opposed to the regular recurrence in each  line of dissyllabic and trisyllabic elements, which elements caused  the rhythm of Latin verse.    Spanish rhythm is a rhythm of series, of strophes, not a rhythm of  regularly recurring accents within a "]]]
