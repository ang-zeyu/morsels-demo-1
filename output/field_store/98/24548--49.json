Psmith had invited him to the flat in exactly the  same spirit as he had invited him to his house for the cricket week.    'You know,' said Psmith, after a silence, as they flitted through the  streets in the taximeter, 'one lives and learns. Were you so wrapped up  in your work this afternoon that you did not hear my very entertaining  little chat with Comrade Bickersdyke, or did it happen to come under  your notice? It did? Then I wonder if you were struck by the singular  conduct of Comrade Rossiter?'    'I thought it rather decent of him not to give you away to that  blighter Bickersdyke.'    'Admirably put. It was precisely that that struck me. He had his  opening, all ready made for him, but he refrained from depositing me in  the soup. I tell you, Comrade Jackson, my rugged old heart was touched.  I said to myself, \"There must be good in Comrade Rossiter, after all. I  must cultivate him.\" I shall make it my business to be kind to our  Departmental head. He deserves the utmost consideration. His action  shone like a good deed in a wicked world. Which it was, of course. From  today onwards I take Comrade Rossiter under my wing. We seem to be  getting into a tolerably benighted quarter. Are we anywhere near?  \"Through Darkest Dulwich in a Taximeter.\"'    The cab arrived at Dulwich station, and Mike stood up to direct the  driver. They whirred down Acacia Road. Mike stopped the cab and got  out. A brief and somewhat embarrassing interview with the pantomime  dame, during which Mike was separated from a week's rent in lieu of  notice, and he was in the cab again, bound for Clement's Inn.    His feelings that night differed considerably from the frame of mind in  which he had gone to bed the night before. It was partly a very  excellent dinner and partly the fact that Psmith's flat, though at  present in some disorder, was obviously going to be extremely  comfortable, that worked the change. But principally it was due to his  having found an ally. The gnawing loneliness had gone. He did not look  forward to a career of Commerce with any greater pleasure than before;  but there was no doubt that with Psmith, it would be easier to get  through the time after office hours. If all went well in the bank he  might find that he had not drawn such a bad ticket after all.          8. The Friendly Native      'The first principle of warfare,' said Psmith at breakfast next  morning, doling out bacon and eggs with the air of a medieval monarch  distributing largesse, 'is to collect a gang, to rope in allies, to  secure the cooperation of some friendly native. You may remember that  at Sedleigh it was partly the sympathetic cooperation of that record  blitherer, Comrade Jellicoe, which enabled us to nip the pro-Spiller  movement in the bud. It is the same in the present crisis. What Comrade  Jellicoe was to us at Sedleigh, Comrade Rossiter must be in the City.  We must make an ally of that man. Once I know that he and I are as  brothers, and that he will look with a lenient and benevolent eye on  any little shortcomings in my work, I shall be able to devote my  attention whole-heartedly to the moral reformation of Comrade  Bickersdyke, that man of blood. I look on Comrade Bickersdyke as a  bargee of the most pronounced type; and anything I can do towards  making him a decent member of Society shall be done freely and  ungrudgingly. A trifle more tea, Comrade Jackson?'    'No, thanks,' said Mike. 'I've done. By Jove, Smith, this flat of yours  is all right.'    'Not bad,' assented Psmith, 'not bad. Free from squalor to a great  extent. I have a number of little objects of _vertu_ coming down  shortly from the old homestead. Pictures, and so on. It will be by no  means un-snug when they are up. Meanwhile, I can rough it. We are old  campaigners, we Psmiths. Give us a roof, a few comfortable chairs, a  sofa or two, half a dozen cushions, and decent meals, and we do not  repine. Reverting once more to Comrade Rossiter--'    'Yes, what about him?' said Mike. 'You'll have a pretty tough job  turning him into a friendly native, I should think. How do you mean to  start?'    Psmith regarded him with a benevolent eye.    'There is but one way,' he said. 'Do you remember the case of Comrade  Outwood, at Sedleigh? How did we corral him, and become to him  practically as long-lost sons?'    'We got round him by joining the Archaeological Society.'    'Precisely,' said Psmith. 'Every man has his hobby. The thing is to  find it out. In the case of comrade Rossiter, I should say that it  would be either postage stamps, dried seaweed, or Hall Caine. I shall  endeavour to find out today. A few casual questions, and the thing is  done. Shall we be putting in an appearance at the busy hive now? If we  are to continue in the running for the bonus stakes, it would be well  to start soon.'    Mike's first duty at the bank that morning was to check the stamps and  petty cash. While he was engaged on this task, he heard Psmith  conversing affably with Mr Rossiter.    'Good morning,' said Psmith.    'Morning,' replied his chief, doing sleight-of-hand tricks with a  bundle of letters which lay on his desk. 'Get on with your work,  Psmith. We have a lot before us.'    'Undoubtedly. I am all impatience. I should say that in an institution  like this, dealing as it does with distant portions of the globe, a  philatelist would have excellent opportunities of increasing his  collection. With me, stamp-collecting has always been a positive craze.  I--'    'I have no time for nonsense of that sort myself,' said Mr Rossiter. 'I  should advise you, if you mean to get on, to devote more time to your  work and less to stamps.'    'I will start at once. Dried seaweed, again--'    'Get on with your work, Smith.'    Psmith retired to his desk.    'This,' he said to Mike, 'is undoubtedly something in the nature of a  set-back. I have drawn blank. The papers bring out posters, \"Psmith  Baffled.\" I must try again. Meanwhile, to work. Work, the hobby of the  philosopher and the poor man's friend.'    The morning dragged slowly on without incident. At twelve o'clock Mike  had to go out and buy stamps, which he subsequently punched in the  punching-machine in the basement, a not very exhilarating job in which  he was assisted by one of the bank messengers, who discoursed learnedly  on roses during the _seance_. Roses were his hobby. Mike began to  see that Psmith had reason in his assumption that the way to every  man's heart was through his hobby. Mike made a firm friend of William,  the messenger, by displaying an interest and a certain knowledge of  roses. At the same time the conversation had the bad effect of leading  to an acute relapse in the matter of homesickness. The rose-garden at  home had been one of Mike's favourite haunts on a summer afternoon. The  contrast between it and the basement of the new Asiatic Bank, the  atmosphere of which was far from being roselike, was too much for his  feelings. He emerged from the depths, with his punched stamps, filled  with bitterness against Fate.    He found Psmith still baffled.    'Hall Caine,' said Psmith regretfully, 'has also proved a frost. I  wandered round to Comrade Rossiter's desk just now with a rather brainy  excursus on \"The Eternal City\", and was received with the Impatient  Frown rather than the Glad Eye. He was in the middle of adding up a  rather tricky column of figures, and my remarks caused him to drop a  stitch. So far from winning the man over, I have gone back. There now  exists between Comrade Rossiter and myself a certain coldness. Further  investigations will be postponed till after lunch.'    The postage department received visitors during the morning. Members of  other departments came with letters, among them Bannister. Mr Rossiter  was away in the manager's room at the time.    'How are you getting on?' said Bannister to Mike.    'Oh, all right,' said Mike.    'Had any trouble with Rossiter yet?'    'No, not much.'    'He hasn't run you in to Bickersdyke?'    'No.'    'Pardon my interrupting a conversation between old college chums,' said  Psmith courteously, 'but I happened to overhear, as I toiled at my  desk, the name of Comrade Rossiter.'    Bannister looked somewhat startled. Mike introduced them.    'This is Smith,' he said. 'Chap I was at school with. This is  Bannister, Smith, who used to be on here till I came.'    'In this department?' asked Psmith.    'Yes.'    'Then, Comrade Bannister, you are the very man I have been looking for.  Your knowledge will be invaluable to us. I have no doubt that, during  your stay in this excellently managed department, you had many  opportunities of observing Comrade Rossiter?'    'I should jolly well think I had,' said Bannister with a laugh. 'He saw  to that. He was always popping out and cursing me about something.'    'Comrade Rossiter's manners are a little restive,' agreed Psmith. 'What  used you to talk to him about?'    'What used I to talk to him about?'    'Exactly. In those interviews to which you have alluded, how did you  amuse, entertain Comrade Rossiter?'    'I didn't. He used to do all the talking there was.'    Psmith straightened his tie, and clicked his tongue, disappointed.    'This is unfortunate,' he said, smoothing his hair. 'You see, Comrade  Bannister, it is this way. In the course of my professional duties, I  find myself continually coming into contact with Comrade Rossiter.'    'I bet you do,' said Bannister.    'On these occasions I am frequently at a loss for entertaining  conversation. He has no difficulty, as apparently happened in your  case, in keeping up his end of the dialogue. The subject of my  shortcomings provides him with ample material for speech. I, on the  other hand, am dumb. I have nothing to say.'    'I should think that was a bit of a change for you, wasn't it?'    'Perhaps, so,' said Psmith, 'perhaps so. On the other hand, however  restful it may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#8)"],[1," persons, as  by Chares the Panian, and Apollodorus the Lemnian, upon husbandry and  planting; and by others on other matters, [1259b] let those who have  occasion consult them thereon; besides, every person should collect  together whatsoever he hears occasionally mentioned, by means of which  many of those who aimed at making a fortune have succeeded in their  intentions; for all these are useful to those who make a point of  getting money, as in the contrivance of Thales the Milesian (which was  certainly a gainful one, but as it was his it was attributed to  his wisdom, though the method he used was a general one, and would  universally succeed), when they reviled him for his poverty, as if the  study of philosophy was useless: for they say that he, perceiving by his  skill in astrology that there would be great plenty of olives that year,  while it was yet winter, having got a little money, he gave earnest for  all the oil works that were in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a  low price, there being no one to bid against him; but when the season  came for making oil, many persons wanting them, he all at once let them  upon what terms he pleased; and raising a large sum of money by that  means, convinced them that it was easy for philosophers to be rich if  they chose it, but that that was not what they aimed at; in this manner  is Thales said to have shown his wisdom. It indeed is, as we have  said, generally gainful for a person to contrive to make a monopoly of  anything; for which reason some cities also take this method when they  want money, and monopolise their commodities. There was a certain person  in Sicily who laid out a sum of money which was deposited in his hand in  buying up all the iron from the iron merchants; so that when the dealers  came from the markets to purchase, there was no one had any to sell but  himself; and though he put no great advance upon it, yet by laying out  fifty talents he made an hundred. When Dionysius heard this he permitted  him to take his money with him, but forbid him to continue any longer in  Sicily, as being one who contrived means for getting money inconsistent  with his affairs. This man's view and Thales's was exactly the same;  both of them contrived to procure a monopoly for themselves: it is  useful also for politicians to understand these things, for many states  want to raise money and by such means, as well as private families,  nay more so; for which reason some persons who are employed in the  management of public affairs confine themselves to this province only.          CHAPTER XII      There are then three parts of domestic government, the masters, of  which we have already treated, the fathers, and the husbands; now the  government of the wife and children should both be that of free persons,  but not the [I259b] same; for the wife should be treated as a citizen of  a free state, the children should be under kingly power; for the male is  by nature superior to the female, except when something happens contrary  to the usual course of nature, as is the elder and perfect to the  younger and imperfect. Now in the generality of free states, the  governors and the governed alternately change place; for an equality  without any preference is what nature chooses; however, when one  governs and another is governed, she endeavours that there should be a  distinction between them in forms, expressions, and honours; according  to what Amasis said of his laver. This then should be the established  rule between the man and the woman. The government of children should  be kingly; for the power of the father over the child is founded in  affection and seniority, which is a species of kingly government; for  which reason Homer very properly calls Jupiter \"the father of gods and  men,\" who was king of both these; for nature requires that a king should  be of the same species with those whom he governs, though superior in  some particulars, as is the case between the elder and the younger, the  father and the son.          CHAPTER XIII      It is evident then that in the due government of a family, greater  attention should be paid to the several members of it and their virtues  than to the possessions or riches of it; and greater to the freemen  than the slaves: but here some one may doubt whether there is any other  virtue in a slave than his organic services, and of higher estimation  than these, as temperance, fortitude, justice, and such-like habits, or  whether they possess only bodily qualities: each side of the question  has its difficulties; for if they possess these virtues, wherein do  they differ from freemen? and that they do not, since they are men,  and partakers of reason, is absurd. Nearly the same inquiry may be made  concerning a woman and a child, whether these also have their proper  virtues; whether a woman ought to be temperate, brave, and just, and  whether a child is temperate or no; and indeed this inquiry ought to be  general, whether the virtues of those who, by nature, either govern or  are governed, are the same or different; for if it is necessary that  both of them should partake of the fair and good, why is it also  necessary that, without exception, the one should govern, the other  always be governed? for this cannot arise from their possessing these  qualities in different degrees; for to govern, and to be governed, are  things different in species, but more or less are not. And yet it is  wonderful that one party ought to have them, and the other not; for if  he who is to govern should not be temperate and just, how can he govern  well? or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well? for he  who is intemperate [1260a] and a coward will never do what he ought: it  is evident then that both parties ought to be virtuous; but there is a  difference between them, as there is between those who by nature command  and who by nature obey, and this originates in the soul; for in this  nature has planted the governing and submitting principle, the virtues  of which we say are different, as are those of a rational and an  irrational being. It is plain then that the same principle may be  extended farther, and that there are in nature a variety of things which  govern and are governed; for a freeman is governed in a different manner  from a slave, a male from a female, and a man from a child: and all  these have parts of mind within them, but in a different manner. Thus  a slave can have no power of determination, a woman but a weak one, a  child an imperfect one. Thus also must it necessarily be with respect to  moral virtues; all must be supposed to possess them, but not in the  same manner, but as is best suited to every one's employment; on which  account he who is to govern ought to be perfect in moral virtue, for his  business is entirely that of an architect, and reason is the architect;  while others want only that portion of it which may be sufficient for  their station; from whence it is evident, that although moral virtue is  common to all those we have spoken of, yet the temperance of a man and  a woman are not the same, nor their courage, nor their justice, though  Socrates thought otherwise; for the courage of the man consists in  commanding, the woman's in obeying; and the same is true in other  particulars: and this will be evident to those who will examine  different virtues separately; for those who use general terms deceive  themselves when they say, that virtue consists in a good disposition of  mind, or doing what is right, or something of this sort. They do much  better who enumerate the different virtues as Georgias did, than those  who thus define them; and as Sophocles speaks of a woman, we think  of all persons, that their 'virtues should be applicable to their  characters, for says he,      \"Silence is a woman's ornament,\"    but it is not a man's; and as a child is incomplete, it is evident that  his virtue is not to be referred to himself in his present situation,  but to that in which he will be complete, and his preceptor. In like  manner the virtue of a slave is to be referred to his master; for we  laid it down as a maxim, that the use of a slave was to employ him in  what you wanted; so that it is clear enough that few virtues are wanted  in his station, only that he may not neglect his work through idleness  or fear: some person may question if what I have said is true, whether  virtue is not necessary for artificers in their calling, for they often  through idleness neglect their work, but the difference between them  is very great; for a slave is connected with you for life, but the  artificer not so nearly: as near therefore as the artificer approaches  to the situation of a slave, just so much ought he to have of the  virtues of one; for a mean artificer is to a certain point a slave; but  then a slave is one of those things which are by nature what they are,  but this is not true [1260b] of a shoemaker, or any other artist. It is  evident then that a slave ought to be trained to those virtues which are  proper for his situation by his master; and not by him who has the power  of a master, to teach him any particular art. Those therefore are in the  wrong who would deprive slaves of reason, and say that they have only to  follow their orders; for slaves want more instruction than children, and  thus we determine this matter. It is necessary, I am sensible, for every  one who treats upon government, to enter particularly into the relations  of husband and wife, and of parent and child, and to show what are the  virtues of each and their respective connections with each other; what  is right and what is wrong; and how the one ought to be followed, and  the other avoided. Since then every family is part of a city, and each  of those individuals is part of a family, and the virtue of the parts  ought to correspond to the virtue of the whole; it is necessary, that  both the wives and"]]]
