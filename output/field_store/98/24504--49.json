And  (to give the observation a higher generality) the form of government  which is most effectual for carrying a people through the next stage  of progress will still be very improper for them if it does this in  such a manner as to obstruct, or positively unfit them for, the step  next beyond. Such cases are frequent, and are among the most  melancholy facts in history. The Egyptian hierarchy, the paternal  despotism of China, were very fit instruments for carrying those  nations up to the point of civilization which they attained. But  having reached that point, they were brought to a permanent halt for  want of mental liberty and individuality--requisites of improvement  which the institutions that had carried them thus far entirely  incapacitated them from acquiring--and as the institutions did not  break down and give place to others, further improvement stopped. In  contrast with these nations, let us consider the example of an  opposite character afforded by another and a comparatively  insignificant Oriental people--the Jews. They, too, had an absolute  monarchy and a hierarchy, and their organized institutions were as  obviously of sacerdotal origin as those of the Hindoos. These  did for them what was done for other Oriental races by their  institutions--subdued them to industry and order, and gave them a  national life. But neither their kings nor their priests ever  obtained, as in those other countries, the exclusive moulding of their  character. Their religion, which enabled persons of genius and a high  religious tone to be regarded and to regard themselves as inspired  from heaven, gave existence to an inestimably precious unorganized  institution--the Order (if it may be so termed) of Prophets. Under the  protection, generally though not always effectual, of their sacred  character, the Prophets were a power in the nation, often more than a  match for kings and priests, and kept up, in that little corner of the  earth, the antagonism of influences which is the only real security  for continued progress. Religion, consequently, was not there what it  has been in so many other places--a consecration of all that was once  established, and a barrier against further improvement. The remark of  a distinguished Hebrew, M. Salvador, that the Prophets were, in Church  and State, the equivalent of the modern liberty of the press, gives a  just but not an adequate conception of the part fulfilled in national  and universal history by this great element of Jewish life; by means  of which, the canon of inspiration never being complete, the persons  most eminent in genius and moral feeling could not only denounce and  reprobate, with the direct authority of the Almighty, whatever  appeared to them deserving of such treatment, but could give forth  better and higher interpretations of the national religion, which  thenceforth became part of the religion. Accordingly, whoever can  divest himself of the habit of reading the Bible as if it was one  book, which until lately was equally inveterate in Christians and in  unbelievers, sees with admiration the vast interval between the  morality and religion of the Pentateuch, or even of the historical  books (the unmistakable work of Hebrew Conservatives of the sacerdotal  order), and the morality and religion of the prophecies--a distance as  wide as between these last and the Gospels. Conditions more favorable  to Progress could not easily exist; accordingly, the Jews, instead of  being stationary like other Asiatics, were, next to the Greeks, the  most progressive people of antiquity, and, jointly with them, have  been the starting-point and main propelling agency of modern  cultivation.    It is, then, impossible to understand the question of the adaptation  of forms of government to states of society, without taking into  account not only the next step, but all the steps which society has  yet to make; both those which can be foreseen, and the far wider  indefinite range which is at present out of sight. It follows, that to  judge of the merits of forms of government, an ideal must be  constructed of the form of government most eligible in itself, that  is, which, if the necessary conditions existed for giving effect to  its beneficial tendencies, would, more than all others, favor and  promote, not some one improvement, but all forms and degrees of it.  This having been done, we must consider what are the mental conditions  of all sorts necessary to enable this government to realize its  tendencies, and what, therefore, are the various defects by which a  people is made incapable of reaping its benefits. It would then be  possible to construct a theorem of the circumstances in which that  form of government may wisely be introduced; and also to judge, in  cases in which it had better not be introduced, what inferior forms of  polity will best carry those communities through the intermediate  stages which they must traverse before they can become fit for the  best form of government.    Of these inquiries, the last does not concern us here, but the first  is an essential part of our subject; for we may, without rashness, at  once enunciate a proposition, the proofs and illustrations of which  will present themselves in the ensuing pages, that this ideally best  form of government will be found in some one or other variety of the  Representative System.        Chapter III--That the ideally best Form of Government is Representative Government.      It has long (perhaps throughout the entire duration of British  freedom) been a common form of speech, that if a good despot could be  insured, despotic monarchy would be the best form of government. I  look upon this as a radical and most pernicious misconception of what  good government is, which, until it can be got rid of, will fatally  vitiate all our speculations on government.    The supposition is, that absolute power, in the hands of an eminent  individual, would insure a virtuous and intelligent performance of all  the duties of government. Good laws would be established and enforced,  bad laws would be reformed; the best men would be placed in all  situations of trust; justice would be as well administered, the public  burdens would be as light and as judiciously imposed, every branch of  administration would be as purely and as intelligently conducted as  the circumstances of the country and its degree of intellectual and  moral cultivation would admit. I am willing, for the sake of the  argument, to concede all this, but I must point out how great the  concession is, how much more is needed to produce even an  approximation to these results than is conveyed in the simple  expression, a good despot. Their realization would in fact imply, not  merely a good monarch, but an all-seeing one. He must be at all times  informed correctly, in considerable detail, of the conduct and working  of every branch of administration, in every district of the country,  and must be able, in the twenty-four hours per day, which are all that  is granted to a king as to the humblest laborer, to give an effective  share of attention and superintendence to all parts of this vast  field; or he must at least be capable of discerning and choosing out,  from among the mass of his subjects, not only a large abundance of  honest and able men, fit to conduct every branch of public  administration under supervision and control, but also the small  number of men of eminent virtues and talents who can be trusted not  only to do without that supervision, but to exercise it themselves  over others. So extraordinary are the faculties and energies required  for performing this task in any supportable manner, that the good  despot whom we are supposing can hardly be imagined as consenting to  undertake it unless as a refuge from intolerable evils, and a  transitional preparation for something beyond. But the argument can do  without even this immense item in the account. Suppose the difficulty  vanquished. What should we then have? One man of superhuman mental  activity managing the entire affairs of a mentally passive people.  Their passivity is implied in the very idea of absolute power. The  nation as a whole, and every individual composing it, are without any  potential voice in their own destiny. They exercise no will in respect  to their collective interests. All is decided for them by a will not  their own, which it is legally a crime for them to disobey. What sort  of human beings can be formed under such a regimen? What development  can either their thinking or their active faculties attain under it?  On matters of pure theory they might perhaps be allowed to speculate,  so long as their speculations either did not approach politics, or had  not the remotest connection with its practice. On practical affairs  they could at most be only suffered to suggest; and even under the  most moderate of despots, none but persons of already admitted or  reputed superiority could hope that their suggestions would be known  to, much less regarded by, those who had the management of affairs. A  person must have a very unusual taste for intellectual exercise in and  for itself who will put himself to the trouble of thought when it is  to have no outward effect, or qualify himself for functions which he  has no chance of being allowed to exercise. The only sufficient  incitement to mental exertion, in any but a few minds in a generation,  is the prospect of some practical use to be made of its results. It  does not follow that the nation will be wholly destitute of  intellectual power. The common business of life, which must  necessarily be performed by each individual or family for themselves,  will call forth some amount of intelligence and practical ability,  within a certain narrow range of ideas. There may be a select class of  _savants_ who cultivate science with a view to its physical uses or  for the pleasure of the pursuit."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#8)"],[1,"any. When the  attack was made, so often as the enemy's cannons were fired, our  wounded said they felt pain in their wounds, as if you had struck  them with a stick: one was crying out on his head, the other on  his arm, and so with the other parts of the body: and many had  their wounds bleed again, even more profusely than at the time  they were wounded, and then I had to run to staunch them. Mon  petit maistre, if you had been there, you would have been much  hindered with your hot irons; you would have wanted a lot of  charcoal to heat them red, and sure you would have been killed  like a calf for your cruelty. Many died of the diabolical storm  of the echo of these engines of artillery, and the vehement  agitation and severe shock of the air acting on their wounds;  others because they got no rest for the shouting and crying that  were made day and night, and for want of good food, and other  things needful for their treatment. Mon petit maistre, if you had  been there, no doubt you could have given them jelly,  restoratives, gravies, pressed meats, broth, barley-water,  almond-milk, blanc-mange, prunes, plums, and other food proper  for the sick; but your diet would have been only on paper, and in  fact they had nothing but beef of old shrunk cows, seized round  Hesdin for our provision, salted and half-cooked, so that he who  would eat it must drag at it with his teeth, as birds of prey  tear their food. Nor must I forget the linen for dressing their  wounds, which was only washed daily and dried at the fire, till  it was as hard as parchment: I leave you to think how their  wounds could do well. There were four big fat rascally women who  had charge to whiten the linen, and were kept at it with the  stick; and yet they had not water enough to do it, much less  soap. That is how the poor patients died, for want of food and  other necessary things.    One day the enemy feigned a general attack, to draw our soldiers  into the breach, that they might see what we were like: every man  ran thither. We had made a great store of artificial fires to  defend the breach; a priest of M. le Duc de Bouillon took a  grenade, thinking to throw it at the enemy, and lighted it before  he ought: it burst, and set fire to all our store, which was in a  house near the breach. This was a terrible disaster for us,  because it burned many poor soldiers; it even caught the house,  and we had all been burned, but for help given to put it out;  there was only one well in the castle with any water in it, and  this was almost dry, and we took beer to put it out instead of  water; afterward we were in great want of water, and to drink  what was left we must strain it through napkins.    The enemy, seeing the explosion and violence of the fires, which  made a wonderful flame and thundering, thought we had lit them on  purpose to defend the breach, and that we had many more of them.  This made them change their minds, to have us some other way than  by attack: they dug mines, and sapped the greater part of our  walls, till they came near turning our castle altogether upside  down; and when the sappers had finished their work, and their  artillery was fired, all the castle shook under our feet like an  earthquake, to our great astonishment. Moreover, they had  levelled five pieces of artillery, which they had placed on a  little hillock, so as to have us from behind when we were gone to  defend the breach. M. le Duc Horace had a cannonshot on the  elbow, which carried off his arm one way and his body the other,  before he could say a single word; his death was a great disaster  to us, for the high rank that he held in the town. Also M. de  Martigues had a gunshot wound which pierced his lungs: I dressed  him, as I shall tell hereafter.    Then we asked leave to speak with the enemy; and a trumpet was  sent to the Prince of Piedmont, to know what terms he would give  us. He answered that all the leaders, such as gentlemen,  captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, would be taken prisoners for  ransom, and the soldiers would leave the town without their arms;  and if we refused this fair and honest offer, we might rest  assured they would take us next day, by attack or otherwise.    A council was held, to which I was called, to know if I would  sign the surrender of the town; with many captains, gentlemen,  and others. I answered it was not possible to hold the town, and  I would sign the surrender with my own blood, for the little hope  I had we could resist the enemy's forces, and for the great  longing I had to be out of this hell and utter torture; for I  slept neither night nor day for the great number of the wounded,  who were about two hundred. The dead were advanced in  putrefaction, piled one upon the other like faggots, and not  covered with earth, because we had none. And if I went into a  soldier's lodging, there were soldiers waiting for me at the door  when I came out, for me to dress others; it was who should have  me, and they carried me like the body of a saint, with my feet  off the ground, fighting for me. I could not satisfy this great  number of wounded: nor had I got what I wanted for their  treatment. For it is not enough that the surgeon do his duty  toward his patients, but the patient also must do his; and the  assistants, and external things, must work together for him: see  Hippocrates, Aphorism the First.    Having heard that we were to surrender the place, I knew our  business was not prospering; and for fear of being known, I gave  a velvet coat, a satin doublet, and a cloak of fine cloth trimmed  with velvet, to a soldier; who gave me a bad doublet all torn and  ragged with wear, and a frayed leather collar, and a bad hat, and  a short cloak; I dirtied the neck of my shirt with water mixed  with a little soot, I rubbed my hose with a stone at the knees  and over the heels, as though they had been long worn, I did the  same to my shoes, till one would have taken me for a chimney-  sweep rather than a King's surgeon. I went in this gear to M. de  Martigues, and prayed him to arrange I should stop with him to  dress him; which he granted very willingly, and was as glad I  should be near him as I was myself.    Soon afterward, the commissioners who were to select the  prisoners entered the castle, the seventeenth day of July, 1553.  They took prisoners MM. le Due de Bouillon, le Marquis de  Villars, de Roze, le Baron de Culan, M. du Pont, commissary of  the artillery, and M. de Martigues; and me with him, because he  asked them; and all the gentlemen who they knew could pay ransom,  and most of the soldiers and the leaders of companies; so many  and such prisoners as they wished. And then the Spanish soldiers  entered by the breach, unresisted; our men thought they would  keep their faith and agreement that all lives should be spared.  They entered the town in a fury to kill, plunder, and ravage  everything: they took a few men, hoping to have ransom for them.  ... If they saw they could not get it, they cruelly put them to  death in cold blood. ... And they killed them all with daggers,  and cut their throats. Such was their great cruelty and  treachery; let him trust them who will.    To return to my story: when I was taken from the castle into the  town, with M. de Martigues, there was one of M. de Savoie's  gentlemen, who asked me if M. de Martigues's wound could be  cured. I told him no, that it was incurable: and off he went to  tell M. le Due de Savoie. I bethought myself they would send  physicians and surgeons to dress M. de Martigues; and I argued  within myself if I ought to play the simpleton, and not let  myself be known for a surgeon, lest they should keep me to dress  their wounded, and in the end I should be found to be the King's  surgeon, and they would make me pay a big ransom. On the other  hand, I feared, if I did not show I was a surgeon and had dressed  M. de Martigues skilfully, they would cut my throat. Forthwith I  made up my mind to show them he would not die for want of having  been well dressed and nursed.    Soon after, sure enough, there came many gentlemen, with the  Emperor's physician, and his surgeon, and those belonging to M.  de Savoie, and six other surgeons of his army, to see M. de  Martigues's wound, and to know of me how I had dressed and  treated it. The Emperor's physician bade me declare the essential  nature of the wound, and what I had done for it. And all his  assistants kept their ears wide open, to know if the wound were  or were not mortal. I commenced my discourse to them, how M.  Martigues, looking over the wall to mark those who were sapping  it, was shot with an arquebus through the body, and I was called  of a sudden to dress him. I found blood coming from his mouth and  from his wounds. Moreover, he bad a great difficulty of breathing  in and out, and air came whistling from the wounds, so that it  would have put out a candle; and he said he had a very great  stabbing pain where the bullet had entered. ... I withdrew some  scales of bone, and put in each wound a tent with a large head,  fastened with a thread, lest on inspiration it should be drawn  into the cavity of the chest; which has happened with surgeons,  to the detriment of the poor wounded; for being fallen in, you  cannot get them out; and then they beget corruption, being  foreign bodies. The tents were anointed with a preparation of  yolk of egg, Venice turpentine, and a little oil of roses. ... I  put over the wounds a great plaster of diachylum, wherewith I had  mixed oil of roses, and vinegar, to avoid inflammation. Then I  applied great compresses steeped in oxycrate, and bandaged him,  not too tight, that he might breathe easily. Next, I drew five  basons of blood from his right arm, considering his youth and his  sanguine temperament. ... Fever took him, soon after he was  wounded, with feebleness of the heart. ... His diet was barley-  water, prunes with sugar, at other times broth:"]]]
