Now I, on the contrary, am always--\"    \"Inclined to talk too much and think too little--eh, Fred?\"    \"Bah! don't try to be funny, man; you haven't it in you. Did you ever  see such a miserable set of creatures as the old Esquimau women are at  Upernavik?\"    \"Why, what put _them_, into your head?\" inquired Tom laughing.    \"Yonder iceberg! Look at it! There's the nose and chin exactly of the  extraordinary hag you gave your silk pocket-handkerchief to at parting.  Now, I never saw such a miserable old woman as that before, did you?\"    Tom Singleton's whole demeanour changed, and his dark eyes brightened as  the strongly-marked brows frowned over them, while he replied, \"Yes,  Fred, I have seen old women more miserable than that. I have seen women  so old that their tottering limbs could scarcely support them, going  about in the bitterest November winds, with clothing too scant to cover  their wrinkled bodies, and so ragged and filthy that you would have  shrunk from touching it--I have seen such groping about among heaps of  filth that the very dogs looked at and turned away from as if in  disgust.\"    Fred was inclined to laugh at his friend's sudden change of manner; but  there was something in the young surgeon's character--perhaps its deep  earnestness--that rendered it impossible, at least for his friends, to  be jocular when he was disposed to be serious. Fred became grave as he  spoke.    \"Where have you seen such poor wretches, Tom?\" he asked, with a look of  interest.    \"In the cities, the civilized cities of our own Christian land. If you  have ever walked about the streets of some of these cities before the  rest of the world was astir, at gray dawn, you must have seen them  shivering along and scratching among the refuse cast out by the tenants  of the neighbouring houses. O Fred, Fred! in my professional career,  short though it has been, I have seen much of these poor old women, and  many others whom the world never sees on the streets at all,  experiencing a slow, lingering death by starvation, and fatigue, and  cold. It is the foulest blot on our country that there is no sufficient  provision for the _aged poor_.\"    \"I have seen those old women too,\" replied Fred, \"but I never thought  very seriously about them before.\"    \"That's it--that's just it; people don't _think_, otherwise this  dreadful state of things would not continue. Just listen _now_, for a  moment, to what I have to say. But don't imagine that I'm standing up  for the poor in general. I don't feel--perhaps I'm wrong,\" continued Tom  thoughtfully--\"perhaps I'm wrong--I hope not--but it's a fact, I don't  feel much for the young and the sturdy poor, and I make it a rule  _never_ to give a farthing to _young_ beggars, not even to little  children, for I know full well that they are sent out to beg by idle,  good-for-nothing parents. I stand up only for the _aged_ poor, because,  be they good or wicked, they _cannot_ help themselves. If a man fell  down in the street, struck with some dire disease that shrunk his  muscles, unstrung his nerves, made his heart tremble, and his skin  shrivel up, would you look upon him and then pass him by _without  thinking?_\"    \"No,\" cried Fred in an emphatic tone, \"I would not! I would stop and  help him.\"    \"Then, let me ask you,\" resumed Tom earnestly, \"is there any difference  between the weakness of muscle and the faintness of heart which is  produced by disease, and that which is produced by old age, except that  the latter is incurable? Have not these women feelings like other women?  Think you that there are not amongst them those who have 'known better  times'? They think of sons and daughters dead and gone, perhaps, just as  other old women in better circumstances do. But they must not indulge  such depressing thoughts; they must reserve all the energy, the stamina  they have, to drag round the city--barefoot, it may be, and in the  cold--to beg for food, and scratch up what they can find among the  cinder heaps. They groan over past comforts and past times, perhaps, and  think of the days when their limbs were strong and their cheeks were  smooth; for they were not always 'hags.' And remember that _once_ they  had friends who loved them and cared for them, although they are old,  unknown, and desolate now.\"    Tom paused and pressed his hand upon his flushed forehead.    \"You may think it strange,\" he continued, \"that I speak to you in this  way about poor old women, but I _feel_ deeply for their forlorn  condition. The young can help themselves, more or less, and they have  strength to stand their sorrows, with _hope_, blessed hope, to keep  them up; but _poor_ old men and old women cannot help themselves, and  cannot stand their sorrows, and, as far as this life is concerned, they  have _no hope,_ except to die soon and easy, and, if possible, in summer  time, when the wind is not so very cold and bitter.\"    \"But how can this be put right, Tom?\" asked Fred in a tone of deep  commiseration. \"Our being sorry for it and anxious about it (and you've  made me sorry, I assure you) can do very little good, you know.\"    \"I don't know, Fred,\" replied Tom, sinking into his usual quiet tone.  \"If every city and town in Great Britain would start a society, whose  first resolution should be that they would not leave one poor _old_ man  or woman unprovided for, _that_ would do it. Or if the Government would  take it in hand _honestly_, that would do it.\"    \"Call all hands, Mr. Bolton,\" cried the captain in a sharp voice. \"Get  out the ice-poles, and lower away the boats.\"    \"Hallo! what's wrong?\" said Fred, starting up.    \"Getting too near the bergs, I suspect,\" remarked Tom. \"I say, Fred,  before we go on deck, will you promise to do what I ask you?\"    \"Well--yes, I will.\"    \"Will you promise, then, all through your life, especially if you ever  come to be rich or influential, to think _of_ and _for_ old men and  women who are poor?\"    \"I will,\" answered Fred; \"but I don't know that I'll ever be rich, or  influential, or able to help them much.\"    \"Of course you don't. But when a thought about them strikes you, will  you always _think it out_, and, if possible, _act it out_, as God shall  enable you?\"    \"Yes, Tom, I promise to do that as well as I can.\"    \"That's right; thank you, my boy,\" said the young surgeon, as they  descended the shrouds and leaped on deck.    Here they found the captain walking up and down rapidly, with an anxious  expression of face. After taking a turn or two he stopped short, and  gazed out astern.    \"Set the stun'-sails, Mr. Bolton. The breeze will be up in a little, I  think. Let the men pull with a will.\"    The order was given, and soon the ship was under a cloud of canvas,  advancing slowly as the boats towed her between two large icebergs,  which had been gradually drawing near to each other the whole afternoon.    \"Is there any danger, Buzzby?\" inquired Fred, as the sturdy sailor stood  looking at the larger berg, with an ice-pole in his hands.    \"Danger? ay, that there is, lad, more nor's agreeable, d'ye see. Here we  are without a breath o' wind to get us on, right between two bergs as  could crack us like a walnut. We can't get to starboard of 'em for the  current, nor to larboard of 'em for the pack, as ye see, so we must go  between them, neck or nothing.\"    The danger was indeed imminent. The two bergs were within a hundred  yards of each other, and the smaller of the two, being more easily moved  by the current probably, was setting down on the larger at a rate that  bade fair to decide the fate of the _Dolphin_ in a few minutes. The men  rowed lustily, but their utmost exertions could move the ship but  slowly. Aid was coming, however, direct from the hand of Him who is a  refuge in the time of danger. A breeze was creeping over the calm sea  right astern, and it was to meet this that the studding-sails had been  set a-low and aloft, so that the wide-spreading canvas, projecting far  to the right and left, had, to an inexperienced eye, the appearance of  being out of all proportion to the little hull by which it was  supported.    With breathless anxiety those on board stood watching the two bergs and  the approaching breeze.    At last it came. A few cat's-paws ruffled the surface of the sea,  distending the sails for a moment, then leaving them flat and loose as  before. This, however, was sufficient; another such puff, and the ship  was almost out of danger; but before it came the projecting summit of  the smaller berg was overhanging the deck. At this critical moment the  wind began to blow steadily, and soon the _Dolphin_ was in the open  water beyond. Five minutes after she had passed, the moving mountains  struck with a noise louder than thunder; the summits and large portions  of the sides fell with a succession of crashes like the roaring of  artillery, just above the spot where the ship had lain not a quarter of  an hour before; and the vessel, for some time after, rocked violently to  and fro in the surges that the plunge of the falling masses had raised.        CHAPTER VI.    _The gale--Anchored to a berg which proves to be a treacherous  one--Dangers of the \"pack\"--Beset in the ice--Mivins shows an inquiring  mind--Walruses--Gale freshens--Chains and cables--Holding on for  life--An unexpected discovery--A \"nip\" and its terrible  consequences--Yoked to an iceberg_.      The narrow escape related in the last chapter was but the prelude to a  night of troubles. Fortunately, as we have before mentioned, _night_ did  not now add darkness to their difficulties. Soon after passing the  bergs, a stiff breeze sprang up off shore, between which and the  _Dolphin_ there was a thick belt of loose ice, or sludge, while outside,  the pack was in motion, and presented a terrible scene of crashing and  grinding masses under the influence of the breeze, which soon freshened  to a gale.    \"Keep"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#9)"],[1,"d., Boston, 1845.

END OF THE CATALOGUE.          INTRODUCTION    HISTORICAL AND CRITICAL      CHAPTER I.    OF THE SCIENCE OF GRAMMAR.    \"Haec de Grammatica quam brevissime potui: non ut omnia dicerem sectatus,  (quod infinitum erat,) sed ut maxima necessaria.\"--QUINTILIAN. _De Inst.  Orat._, Lib. i, Cap. x.    1. Language, in the proper sense of the term, is peculiar to man; so that,  without a miraculous assumption of human powers, none but human beings can  make words the vehicle of thought. An imitation of some of the articulate  sounds employed in speech, may be exhibited by parrots, and sometimes by  domesticated ravens, and we know that almost all brute animals have their  peculiar natural voices, by which they indicate their feelings, whether  pleasing or painful. But _language_ is an attribute of reason, and differs  essentially not only from all brute voices, but even from all the  chattering, jabbering, and babbling of our own species, in which there is  not an intelligible meaning, with division of thought, and distinction of  words.    2. Speech results from the joint exercise of the best and noblest faculties  of human nature, from our rational understanding and our social affection;  and is, in the proper use of it, the peculiar ornament and distinction of  man, whether we compare him with other orders in the creation, or view him  as an individual preeminent among his fellows. Hence that science which  makes known the nature and structure of speech, and immediately concerns  the correct and elegant use of language, while it surpasses all the  conceptions of the stupid or unlearned, and presents nothing that can seem  desirable to the sensual and grovelling, has an intrinsic dignity which  highly commends it to all persons of sense and taste, and makes it most a  favourite with the most gifted minds. That science is Grammar. And though  there be some geniuses who affect to despise the trammels of grammar rules,  to whom it must be conceded that many things which have been unskillfully  taught as such, deserve to be despised; yet it is true, as Dr. Adam  remarks, that, \"The study of Grammar has been considered an object of great  importance by the wisest men in all ages.\"--_Preface to Latin and English  Gram._, p. iii.    3. Grammar bears to language several different relations, and acquires from  each a nature leading to a different definition. _First_, It is to  language, as knowledge is to the thing known; and as doctrine, to the  truths it inculcates. In these relations, grammar is a science. It is the  first of what have been called the seven sciences, or liberal branches of  knowledge; namely, grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry,  astronomy, and music. _Secondly_, It is as skill, to the thing to be done;  and as power, to the instruments it employs. In these relations, grammar is  an art; and as such, has long been defined, \"_ars recte scribendi, recteque  loquendi_\" the art of writing and speaking correctly. _Thirdly_, It is as  navigation, to the ocean, which nautic skill alone enables men to traverse.  In this relation, theory and practice combine, and grammar becomes, like  navigation, a practical science. _Fourthly_, It is as a chart, to a coast  which we would visit. In this relation, our grammar is a text-book, which  we take as a guide, or use as a help to our own observation. _Fifthly_, It  is as a single voyage, to the open sea, the highway of nations. Such is our  meaning, when we speak of the grammar of a particular text or passage.    4. Again: Grammar is to language a sort of self-examination. It turns the  faculty of speech or writing upon itself for its own elucidation; and makes  the tongue or the pen explain the uses and abuses to which both are liable,  as well as the nature "]]]
