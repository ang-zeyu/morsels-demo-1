The  academics always talk of doubt and suspense of judgement, of danger in  hasty determinations, of confining to very narrow bounds the enquiries  of the understanding, and of renouncing all speculations which lie not  within the limits of common life and practice. Nothing, therefore, can  be more contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indolence of the  mind, its rash arrogance, its lofty pretensions, and its superstitious  credulity. Every passion is mortified by it, except the love of truth;  and that passion never is, nor can be, carried to too high a degree. It  is surprising, therefore, that this philosophy, which, in almost every  instance, must be harmless and innocent, should be the subject of so  much groundless reproach and obloquy. But, perhaps, the very  circumstance which renders it so innocent is what chiefly exposes it to  the public hatred and resentment. By flattering no irregular passion, it  gains few partizans: By opposing so many vices and follies, it raises to  itself abundance of enemies, who stigmatize it as libertine profane, and  irreligious.    Nor need we fear that this philosophy, while it endeavours to limit our  enquiries to common life, should ever undermine the reasonings of common  life, and carry its doubts so far as to destroy all action, as well as  speculation. Nature will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the  end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever. Though we should conclude,  for instance, as in the foregoing section, that, in all reasonings from  experience, there is a step taken by the mind which is not supported by  any argument or process of the understanding; there is no danger that  these reasonings, on which almost all knowledge depends, will ever be  affected by such a discovery. If the mind be not engaged by argument to  make this step, it must be induced by some other principle of equal  weight and authority; and that principle will preserve its influence as  long as human nature remains the same. What that principle is may well  be worth the pains of enquiry.    35. Suppose a person, though endowed with the strongest faculties of  reason and reflection, to be brought on a sudden into this world; he  would, indeed, immediately observe a continual succession of objects,  and one event following another; but he would not be able to discover  anything farther. He would not, at first, by any reasoning, be able to  reach the idea of cause and effect; since the particular powers, by  which all natural operations are performed, never appear to the senses;  nor is it reasonable to conclude, merely because one event, in one  instance, precedes another, that therefore the one is the cause, the  other the effect. Their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual. There  may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of  the other. And in a word, such a person, without more experience, could  never employ his conjecture or reasoning concerning any matter of fact,  or be assured of anything beyond what was immediately present to his  memory and senses.    Suppose, again, that he has acquired more experience, and has lived so  long in the world as to have observed familiar objects or events to be  constantly conjoined together; what is the consequence of this  experience? He immediately infers the existence of one object from the  appearance of the other. Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired  any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object  produces the other; nor is it, by any process of reasoning, he is  engaged to draw this inference. But still he finds himself determined to  draw it: And though he should be convinced that his understanding has no  part in the operation, he would nevertheless continue in the same course  of thinking. There is some other principle which determines him to form  such a conclusion.    36. This principle is Custom or Habit. For wherever the repetition of  any particular act or operation produces a propensity to renew the same  act or operation, without being impelled by any reasoning or process of  the understanding, we always say, that this propensity is the effect of  _Custom_. By employing that word, we pretend not to have given the  ultimate reason of such a propensity. We only point out a principle of  human nature, which is universally acknowledged, and which is well known  by its effects. Perhaps we can push our enquiries no farther, or pretend  to give the cause of this cause; but must rest contented with it as the  ultimate principle, which we can assign, of all our conclusions from  experience. It is sufficient satisfaction, that we can go so far,  without repining at the narrowness of our faculties because they will  carry us no farther. And it is certain we here advance a very  intelligible proposition at least, if not a true one, when we assert  that, after the constant conjunction of two objects--heat and flame, for  instance, weight and solidity--we are determined by custom alone to  expect the one from the appearance of the other. This hypothesis seems  even the only one which explains the difficulty, why we draw, from a  thousand instances, an inference which we are not able to draw from one  instance, that is, in no respect, different from them. Reason is  incapable of any such variation. The conclusions which it draws from  considering one circle are the same which it would form upon surveying  all the circles in the universe. But no man, having seen only one body  move after being impelled by another, could infer that every other body  will move after a like impulse. All inferences from experience,  therefore, are effects of custom, not of reasoning[7].        [7] Nothing is more useful than for writers, even, on _moral_,      _political_, or _physical_ subjects, to distinguish between      _reason_ and _experience_, and to suppose, that these species      of argumentation are entirely different from each other. The      former are taken for the mere result of our intellectual      faculties, which, by considering _a priori_ the nature of      things, and examining the effects, that must follow from their      operation, establish particular principles of science and      philosophy. The latter are supposed to be derived entirely from      sense and observation, by which we learn what has actually      resulted from the operation of particular objects, and are      thence able to infer, what will, for the future, result from      them. Thus, for instance, the limitations and restraints of      civil government, and a legal constitution, may be defended,      either from _reason_, which reflecting on the great frailty and      corruption of human nature, teaches, that no man can safely be      trusted with unlimited authority; or from _experience_ and      history, which inform us of the enormous abuses, that ambition,      in every age and country, has been found to make of so      imprudent a confidence.        The same distinction between reason and experience is      maintained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of      life; while the experienced statesman, general, physician, or      merchant is trusted and followed; and the unpractised novice,      with whatever natural talents endowed, neglected and despised.      Though it be allowed, that reason may form very plausible      conjectures with regard to the consequences of such a      particular conduct in such particular circumstances; it is      still supposed imperfect, without the assistance of experience,      which is alone able to give stability and certainty to the      maxims, derived from study and reflection.        But notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally      received, both in the active speculative scenes of life, I      shall not scruple to pronounce, that it is, at bottom,      erroneous, at least, superficial.        If we examine those arguments, which, in any of the sciences      above mentioned, are supposed to be the mere effects of      reasoning and reflection, they will be found to terminate, at      last, in some general principle or conclusion, for which we can      assign no reason but observation and experience. The only      difference between them and those maxims, which are vulgarly      esteemed the result of pure experience, is, that the former      cannot be established without some process of thought, and some      reflection on what we have observed, in order to distinguish      its circumstances, and trace its consequences: Whereas in the      latter, the experienced event is exactly and fully familiar to      that which we infer as the result of any particular situation.      The history of a TIBERIUS or a NERO makes us dread a like      tyranny, were our monarchs freed from the restraints of laws      and senates: But the observation of any fraud or cruelty in      private life is sufficient, with the aid of a little thought,      to give us the same apprehension; while it serves as an      instance of the general corruption of human nature, and shows      us the danger which we must incur by reposing an entire      confidence in mankind. In both cases, it is experience which is      ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion.        There is no man so young and unexperienced, as not to have      formed, from observation, many general and just maxims      concerning human affairs and the conduct of life; but it must      be confessed, that, when a man comes to put these in practice,      he will be extremely liable to error, till time and farther      experience both enlarge these maxims, and teach him their      proper use and application. In every situation or incident,      there are many particular and seemingly minute circumstances,      which the man of greatest talent is, at first, apt to overlook,      though on them the justness of his conclusions, and      consequently the prudence of his conduct,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#8)"],[1,"known. It has also been  in use in West Virginia for a quarter of a century, as well as in  the petroleum region of western Pennsylvania, where it has long been  utilized in generating steam for drilling oil wells.    In 1826 the _American Journal of Science_ contained a letter from Dr.  S.P. Hildreth, who, in writing of the products of the Muskingum (Ohio)  Valley, said: \"They have sunk two wells, which are now more than four  hundred feet in depth; one of them affords a very strong and pure  salt water, but not in great quantity; the other discharges such vast  quantities of petroleum, or, as it is vulgarly called, 'Seneka oil,' and  besides is so subject to such tremendous explosions of gas, as to force  out all the water and afford nothing but gas for several days, that they  make little or no salt.\"    The value of the foregoing references is to be found in the testimony  they offer as to the duration of the supply of natural gas. Whether we  look to the eternal flaming fissures of the Caucasus, or to New York,  Pennsylvania, and Ohio, there is much to encourage the belief that the  flow of natural gas may be, like the production of petroleum, increased  rather than diminished by the draughts made upon it. Petroleum, instead  of diminishing in quantity by the millions of barrels drawn from western  Pennsylvania in the last quarter of a century, seems to increase,  greater wells being known in 1884 than in any previous year, and prices  having fallen from two dollars per bottle for \"Seneka oil\" to sixty  cents per barrel for the same article under the name of crude petroleum.  Hence we may assume that, as new pipe-lines are laid, the supply of  natural gas available for use in the great manufacturing district of  Pittsburg and vicinity will be increased, and the price of this fuel  diminished in a corresponding ratio.    Natural gas is now supplied in Pittsburg at a small discount on  the actual cost of coal used last year in the large manufacturing  establishments, an additional saving being made in dispensing with  firemen and avoidance of hauling ashes from the boiler-room. It is  supplied, for domestic purposes, at twenty cents per thousand cubic  feet, which is not cheaper than coal in Pittsburg, but it is a thousand  per cent cleaner, and in that respect it promises to prove a great  blessing, not only to those who can afford to use it, but to the  community at large, in the hope held out that the smoke and soot  nuisance may be abated in part, if not wholly subdued, and that gleams  of sunshine there may become less phenomenal in the future than they are  at the present time. Twenty cents per thousand feet is too high a price  to bring gas into general use for domestic purposes in a city where  coal is cheap. Ten cents would be too much, and no doubt five cents per  thousand would pay a profit. The fact is, the dealers in natural gas  appear to be somewhat doubtful of the continuity of supply, and  anxious to get back the cost of wells and pipes in one year, which, if  successful, would be an enormous return on the investment.    There are objections to the use of natural gas by mill operators--that  it costs too much, and that the continuity of the supply is uncertain;  by heads of families, that it is odorless, and, in case of leakage from  the pipes, may fill a room and be ready to explode without giving the  fragrant warning offered by common gas. Both of these objections will  probably disappear under the experience that time must furnish. More  wells and tributary lines will lessen the cost and tend to regulate the  pressure for manufacturers. Cut-offs and escape pipes outside of the  house will reduce the risk of explosions within. The danger in the  house may also be lessened by providing healthful ventilation in all  apartments wherein gas shall be consumed.    This subject of, the ventilation of rooms in which common gas is  ordinarily used is beginning to attract attention. It is stated, upon  scientific authority, that a jet of common gas, equivalent to twelve  sperm candles, consumes 5.45 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, producing  3.21 feet of carbonic acid gas, vitiating, according to Dr. Tidy's  \"Handbook of Chemistry,\" 348.25 cubic feet of air. In every five cubic  feet of pure air in a room there is one cubic foot of oxygen and four  of nitrogen. Without oxygen human life, as well as light, would become  extinct. It is asserted that one common gas-jet consumes as much oxygen  as five persons.    Carbonic acid gas is the element which, in deep mines and vaults, causes  almost instant insensibility and suffocation to persons subjected to its  influences, and instantly extinguishes the flame of any light lowered  into it. The normal quantity of this gas contained in the air we breathe  is 0.04; one per cent, of it causes distress in breathing; two per cent,  is dangerous; four per cent, extinguishes life, and four per cent of it  is contained in air expelled from the lungs. According to Dr. Tidy's  table, each ordinary jet of common gas contributes to the air of a room  sixteen by ten feet on the sides and nine feet high, containing 1,440  cubic feet of air, twenty-two per cent, of carbonic acid gas, which,  continued for twenty-four hours without ventilation, would reach the  fatal four per cent.    Prof. Huxley gives, as a result of chemical analyses, the following  table of ratio of carbonic-acid gas in the atmosphere at the points  named:      On the Thames, at London                           0.0343    In the streets of London                           0.0380    Top of Ben Nevis                                   0.0327    Dress circle of Haymarket theater (11:30 P.M.)     0.0757    Chancery Court (seven feet from the ground)        0.1930    From working mines (average of 339 samples)        0.7853    Largest amount in a Cornish mine                   2.0500    In addition to the consumption of oxygen and production of carbonic acid  by the use of common gas, the gas itself, owing to defectiveness of the  burner, is projected into the air. Now, considering the deleterious  nature of all illuminating gases, the reasons for perfect ventilation of  rooms in which natural gas is used for heating and culinary purposes are  self-evident, not alone as a protection against explosions, but for the  health of the occupants of the house, remembering that a larger supply  of oxygen is said to be necessary for the perfect combustion of natural  than of common gas.    Carbonic oxide, formed by the consumption of carbon, with an  insufficient supply of air, is the fatal poison of the charcoal furnace,  not infrequently resorted to, in close rooms, as a means of suicide.  The less sufficient the air toward perfect combustion, the smaller the  quantity of carbonic acid and the greater the amount of carbonic oxide.  That is to say, at the time of ignition the chief product of combustion  is carbonic oxide, and, unless sufficient air be added to convert the  oxide to carbonic acid, a decidedly dangerous product is given off into  the room. Yet, by means of a flue to carry off the poisonous gases from  burning jets, the combustion of gas, creating a current, is made an aid  to ventilation. Unfortunately, this important fact, if commonly known,  is not much heeded by heads of families or builders of houses. But in  any large community where gas comes into general use as an article of  fuel, this fact will gradually become recognized and respected.    The property of indicating the presence of very minute quantities of gas  in a room is claimed for an instrument recently described by C. Von Jahn  in the _Revue Industrielle_. This is a porous cup, inverted and closed  by a perforated rubber stopper. Through the perforation in the stopper  the interior of the cup is connected with a pressure gauge containing  colored water. It is claimed that the diffusion of gas through the  earthenware raises the level of the water in the gauge so delicately  that the presence of one-half of one per cent, of gas may be detected by  it. Other instruments of a slightly different character are credited by  their inventors with most sensitive power of indicating gas-leakages,  but their practical efficiency remains to be demonstrated. An automatic  cut-off for use outside of houses in which natural gas is consumed has  been invented, but this writer knows nothing of either its mode of  action or its effectiveness.    The great economic question, however, connected with the use of natural  gas is, how will it affect the industrial interests of the country?  There are grounds for the belief that a sufficient supply of natural gas  may be found in the vicinity of Pittsburg to reduce the cost of fuel to  such a degree as to make competition in the manufacture of iron, steel,  and glass, in any part of the country where coal must be used, out of  the question. Such a condition of affairs would probably result in  driving the great manufacturing concerns of the country into the region  where natural gas is to obtained. That may be anywhere from the western  slope of the Alleghanies to Lake Erie or to Lake Michigan. And, if the  cost of producing iron, steel, and glass can be so cheapened by the new  fuel, the tariff question may undergo some important modification in  politics. For, if the reduction in the cost of fuel should ever become  an offset to the lower rate of wages in Europe, the manufacturers of  Pennsylvania, who have long been the chief support of the protective  policy of the country, may lose their present interest in that question,  and leave the tariff to shift for itself elsewhere. It should be  remembered that natural gas is not, as yet, much cheaper than coal  in Pittsburg. But it may safely be assumed that it will cheapen, as  petroleum has done, by a development of the territory in which it is  known to exist in enormous quantities. It is quite possible that,  instead of buying gas, many factories will"]]]
