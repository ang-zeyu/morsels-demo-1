[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11198"],[0,"Christianity and Islam (#9)"],[1,"mosque was thus developed. Before  the age of mosques, a lance had been planted in the ground and prayer  offered behind it: so in the mosque a prayer niche was made, a  survival of the pre-existing custom. There are many obscure points in  the development of the worship, but one fact may be asserted with  confidence: the developments of ritual were derived from pre-existing  practices, which were for the most part Christian.    But the religious energy of Islam was not exclusively devoted to the  development and practice of the doctrine of duties; at the same time  this ethical department, in spite of its dependency upon Christian and  Jewish ideas, remains its most original achievement: we have pursued  the subject at some length, because its importance is often overlooked  in the course of attempts to estimate the connection between  Christianity and Islam. On the other hand, affinities in the regions  of mysticism and dogma have long been matter of common knowledge and a  brief sketch of them will therefore suffice. If not essential to our  purpose within the limits of this book, they are none the less  necessary to complete our treatment of the subject.    By mysticism we understand the expression of religious emotion, as  contrasted with efforts to attain righteousness by full obedience to  the ethical doctrine of duties, and also in contrast to the  hair-splitting of dogmatic speculation: mysticism strove to reach  immediate emotional unity with the Godhead. No trace of any such  tendency was to be found in the Qoran: it entered Islam as a complete  novelty, and the affinities which enabled it to gain a footing have  been difficult to trace.    Muhammedan mysticism is certainly not exclusively Christian: its  origins, like those of Christian mysticism, are to be found in the  pantheistic writings of the Neoplatonist school of Dionysius the  Areopagite: but Islam apparently derived its mysticism from Christian  sources. In it originated the idea, with all its capacity for  development, of the mystical love of God: to this was added the theory  and practice of asceticism which was especially developed by  Christianity, and, in later times, the influence of Indian philosophy,  which is unmistakable. Such are the fundamental elements of this  tendency. When the idea of the Nirwana, the Arab _fan[=a]_, is  attained, Muhammedanism proper comes to an end. But orthodoxy controls  the divergent elements: it opposes any open avowal of the logical  conclusion, which would identify \"God\" and the \"ego,\" but in practice  this group of ideas, pantheistic in all but name, has been received  and given a place side by side with the strict monotheism of the Qoran  and with the dogmatic theology. Any form of mysticism which is pushed  to its logical consequences must overthrow positive religion. By  incorporating this dangerous tendency within itself, Islam has averted  the peril which it threatens. Creed is no longer endangered, and this  purpose being secured, thought is free.    Union with God is gained by ecstasy and leads to enthusiasm. These  terms will therefore show us in what quarter we must seek the  strongest impulses to mysticism. The concepts, if not the actual  terms, are to be found in Islam: they were undoubtedly transmitted by  Christianity and undergo the wide extension which results in the  dervish and fakir developments. _Dervish_ and _fakir_ are the Persian  and Arabic words for \"beggar\": the word _sufi_, a man in a woollen  shirt, is also used in the same sense. The terms show that asceticism  is a fundamental element in mysticism; asceticism was itself an  importation to Islam. Dervishes are divided into different classes or  orders, according to the methods by which they severally prefer to  attain ecstasy: dancing and recitation are practised by the dancing  and howling dervishes and other methods are in vogue. It is an  institution very different from monasticism but the result of a course  of development undoubtedly similar to that which produced the monk:  dervishism and monasticism are independent developments of the same  original idea.    Among these Muhammedan companies attempts to reach the point of  ecstasy have developed to a rigid discipline of the soul; the believer  must subject himself to his master, resigning all power of will, and  so gradually reaches higher stages of knowledge until he is eventually  led to the consciousness of his absolute identity with God. It seems  to me beyond question that this method is reflected in the _exercitiis  spiritualibus_ of Ignatius Loyola, the chief instrument by which the  Jesuits secured dominion over souls. Any one who has realised the  enormous influence which Arab thought exerted upon Spanish  Christianity so late as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, will  not regard the conjecture as unfounded.    When a man's profession or position prevented him from practising  these mystical exercises, he satisfied his religious needs by  venerating persons who were nearer to the deity and whose intercession  was effectual even after their death and sometimes not until they were  dead: hence arose the veneration of saints, a practice as alien as  pantheistic dogma to primitive Islam. The adoption of Christian saint  worship was not possible until the person of Muhammed himself had been  exalted above the ordinary level of humanity. Early Muhammedans  observed that the founder of Christianity was regarded by popular  opinion as a miracle worker of unrivalled power: it was impossible for  the founder of Islam to remain inferior in this respect. Thus the  early biographies of the prophet, which appeared in the first century  of Muhammedanism, recount the typical miracles of the Gospels, the  feeding of multitudes, healing the sick, raising the dead and so  forth. Two methods of adoption may be distinguished. Special features  are directly borrowed, or the line of advance is followed which had  introduced the worship of saints and relics to Christianity a short  time before. The religious emotions natural to any people produced a  series of ideas which pass from one religion to another. Outward form  and purport may be changed, but the essential points remain unaltered  and are the living expression of that relation to God in which a  people conceives itself to stand. Higher forms of religion--a fact as  sad as it is true--require a certain degree not only of moral but of  intellectual capacity.    Thus we have traversed practically the whole circle of religious life  and have everywhere found Islam following in the path of Christian  thought. One department remains to be examined, which might be  expected to offer but scanty opportunity for borrowings of this kind;  this is dogma. Here, if anywhere, the contrast between the two  religions should be obvious. The initial divergencies were so  pronounced, that any adoption of Christian ideas would seem  impossible. Yet in those centuries, Christianity was chiefly agitated  by dogmatic questions, which occupied men's minds as greatly as social  problems at the present day. Here we can observe most distinctly, how  the problems at least were taken over by Islam.    Muhammedan dogmatic theology is concerned only with three main  questions, the problem of free-will, the being and attributes of God,  and the eternal uncreated nature of God's word. The mere mention of  these problems will recall the great dogmatic struggles of early  Christianity. At no time have the problems of free-will and the nature  of God, been subjects of fiercer dispute than during the  Christological and subsequent discussions. Upholders of freedom or of  determinism could alike find much to support their theories in the  Qoran: Muhammed was no dogmatist and for him the ideas of man's  responsibility and of God's almighty and universal power were not  mutually exclusive. The statement of the problem was adopted from  Christianity as also was the dialectical subtlety by which a solution  was reached, and which, while admitting the almighty power of God,  left man responsible for his deeds by regarding him as free to accept  or refuse the admonitions of God. Thus the thinkers and their demands  for justice and righteous dealing were reconciled to the blind  fatalism of the masses, which again was not a native Muhammedan  product, but is the outcome of the religious spirit of the East.    The problem of reconciling the attributes of God with the dogma of His  unity was solved with no less subtlety. The mere idea that a  multiplicity of attributes was incompatible with absolute unity was  only possible in a school which had spent centuries in the desperate  attempt to reconcile the inference of a divine Trinity with the  conception of absolute divine unity.    Finally, the third question, \"Was the Qoran, the word of God, created  or not?\" is an obvious counterpart of the Logos problem, of the  struggle to secure recognition of the Logos as eternal and uncreated  together with God. Islam solved the question by distinguishing the  eternal and uncreated Qoran from the revealed and created. The eternal  nature of the Qoran was a dogma entirely alien to the strict  monotheism of Islam: but this fact was never realised, any more than  the fact that the acceptance of the dogma was a triumph for  Graeco-Christian dialectic. There can be no more striking proof of the  strength of Christian influence: it was able to undermine the  fundamental dogma of Islam, and the Muhammedans never realised the  fact.    In our review of these dogmatic questions, we have met with a novel  tendency, that to metaphysical speculation and dialectic. It was from  Christendom, not directly from the Greek world, that this spirit  reached Islam: the first attitude of Muhammedanism towards it was that  which Christianity adopted towards all non-religious systems of  thought. Islam took it up as a useful weapon for the struggle against  heresy. But it soon became a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#9)"],[1,"of the frog. It is continued backwards as two ridge-like  branches, which, at the points of the heels, form acute angles with the  bars. On the outer side of each lateral ridge is a fissure. These are known  as the Lateral Lacunae.    _The Sides_ of the frog are flat and slightly oblique. They are closely  united to the bars and to the triangular indentation in the posterior  border of the sole.    _The Base_ of the frog is formed by the extremities of its branches, which,  becoming wider and more convex as they pass backwards, form two rounded,  flexible, and elastic masses separated from each other by the median  lacuna. These constitute the 'glomes' of the frog. They are continuous with  the periople.    _The Point of the Frog_ is situated, wedge-like, within the triangular  notch in the posterior border of the sole.    4. THE PERIOPLE, OR CORONARY FROG BAND.--This is a continuation of the  substance of the frog around the extreme upper surface of the hoof. It is  widest at the heels over the bulbs or glomes of the frog, and gradually  narrows as it reaches the front of the hoof. It is, in reality, a thin  pellicle of semi-transparent horn secreted by the cells of the perioplic  ring. When left untouched by the farrier's rasp it serves the purpose, by  acting as a natural varnish, of protecting the horn of the wall from the  effects of undue heat or moisture.        CHAPTER III    GENERAL PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS      The matter embraced by the heading of this chapter will offer for  discussion many subjects of great interest to the veterinary surgeon.  Around some of them debate has for many years waxed more than keen. Of the  points in dispute, some of them may be regarded as satisfactorily settled,  while others offer still further room for investigation.    In this volume we can only hope to deal with them in brief, and must select  such as appear to have the greatest bearing on the veterinarian's everyday  practice.    Always prolific of heated discussion has been one question: 'Are the horny  laminae secreted by the sensitive?' To answer this satisfactorily, it will  be best to give a short account of the mode of production of the hoof in  general.      A. DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOOF.    Starting with the statement that it is epidermal in origin, we will  first consider the structure of the skin, and follow that with a brief  description of the structure and mode of growth of the human nail, a short  study of which will greatly assist us when we come to investigate the  manner of growth of the horse's hoof.    THE SKIN is composed of two portions, the EPIDERMIS and the CORIUM.    THE EPIDERMIS is a stratified epithelium. The superficial layers of the  cells composing it are hard and horny, while the deeper layers are soft and  protoplasmic. These latter form the so-called _Retae Mucosum_ of Malpighi.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--VERTICAL SECTION OF EPIDERMIS (HUMAN). (AFTER  RANVIER) _A_, The horny layer of the epidermis; _B_, the rete mucosum;  _a_, the columnar pigment-containing cells of the rete; _b_, the polyhedral  cells; _c_, the stratum granulosum; _d_, the stratum lucidum; _e_, swollen  horny cells; _f_ the stratum squamosum.]    Commencing from below and proceeding upwards, we find that the lowermost  cells of the rete mucosum, those that are set immediately on the corium,  are columnar in shape. In animals that have a coloured skin these cells  contain pigment granules. Directly superposed to these we find cells which  in shape are polyhedral. Above them, and forming the most superficial layer  of the rete mucosum, is a series of flattened, granular-looking cells known  as the _stratum granulosum_.    Immediately above the stratum granulosum the horny portion of the epidermis  commences. In the human skin this is formed of three distinct layers.  Undermost a layer of clear compressed cells, the _stratum lucidum_.  Next above it a layer of swollen cells, the nuclei of which are  indistinguishable. Finally, a surface layer of thin, horny scales, the  _stratum squamosum_, which become detached and thrown off in the form of  scurf or dandruff. In the skin of the horse, except where it is thickest,  these layers are not clearly defined.    It is the Malpighian layer of the epidermis that is most active in cell  division. As they are formed the new cells push upwards those already  there, and the latter in their progress to the surface undergo a chemical  change in which their protoplasm is converted into horny material. This  change, as we have already indicated, takes place above the stratum  granulosum.    In addition to its constant formation of cells to replace those cast  off from the surface, the active proliferation of the elements of the  Malpighian layer is responsible for the development of the various  appendages of the skin, the hairs with their sebaceous glands, the sweat  glands, horny growths and the hoof, and, in the human subject, the nail.  These occur as thickenings and down-growths of the epithelium into the  corium.    The epidermis is devoid of bloodvessels, but is provided with fine nerve  fibrils which ramify between the cells of the rete mucosum.    THE CORIUM is composed of dense connective tissue, the superficial layer  of which bears minute papillae. These project into the epidermis, which is  moulded on them. For the most part the papillae contain looped capillary  vessels, rendering the superficial layer of the corium extremely vascular.  Why this must be a moment's reflection will show. The epidermis, as we have  already said, is devoid of bloodvessels. It therefore depends entirely for  its nourishment upon the indirect supply it receives from the vessels of  the corium. The need for extreme vascularity of the corium is further  explained when we call to mind the constant proliferation and casting off  of the cells of the epidermis, the growth of the hairs, the production of  the horn of the hoof, and the work performed by the numerous sweat and  other glands.    Others of the papillae contain nerves, ending here in tactile corpuscles, or  continuing, as we have mentioned before, to ramify as fine fibrils in the  rete mucosum of the epidermis.    THE HAIRS are growths of the epidermis extending downwards into the deeper  part of the corium. Each is developed in a small pit, the _Hair Follicle_,  from the bottom of which it grows, the part lying within the follicle being  known as the _Root_. It is important to note their structure, as it will be  seen later that they bear an extremely close relation to the horn of the  hoof.    Under a high power of the microscope, and in optical section, the central  portion of a hair is tube-like. In some cases the cavity of the tube is  occupied by a dark looking substance formed of angular cells, and known as  the _Medulla_. The walls of the tube, or the main substance of the hair, is  made up of a pigmented, _horny, fibrous material_. This fibrous structure  is covered by a delicate layer of finely imbricated scales, and is termed  the _Hair Cuticle_.    The root of the hair, that portion within the follicle, has exactly the  same formation save at its extreme end. Here it becomes enlarged into  a knob-like formation composed of soft, growing cells, which knob-like  formation fits over a vascular papilla projecting up in the bottom of the  follicle.    We have already stated that the hairs are down-growths of the epidermis.  It follows, therefore, that the hair follicles, really depressions  or cul-de-sacs of the skin itself, are lined by epithelial cells and  connective tissue. So closely does the epidermal portion of the follicle  invest the hair root that it is often dragged out with it, and is known  as the _Root Sheath_. This is made up of an outer layer of columnar cells  (_the outer root sheath_) corresponding to the Malpighian layer of the  epidermis, and of an inner horny layer, next to the hair, corresponding to  the more superficial layer of the epidermis, and known as the _inner root  sheath_.    The hair grows from the bottom of the follicle by a multiplication of the  cells covering the papilla upon which its root is moulded. When a hair is  cast off a new one is produced from the cells covering the papilla, or, in  case of the death or degeneration of the original papilla, the new hair is  produced from a second papilla formed in place of the first at the bottom  of the follicle.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--SECTION OF SKIN WITH HAIR FOLLICLE AND HAIR. _a_,  The hair follicle; _b_, the hair root; _c_, the medulla; _d_, the hair  cuticle; _e_, the outer root sheath; _f_, the inner root sheath; _g_, the  papilla from which the hair is growing; _h_, a sebaceous gland; _i_, a  sudoriferous gland.]    THE SEBACEOUS GLANDS are small saccular glands with their ducts opening  into the mouths of the hair follicles. They furnish a natural lubricant to  the hairs and the skin.    THE SUDORIFEROUS OR SWEAT GLANDS are composed of coiled tubes which lie in  the deeper portion of the skin, and send up a corkscrew-like duct to open  on the surface of the epidermis. They are numerous over the whole of the  body.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--LONGITUDINAL SECTION THROUGH NAIL AND NAIL-BED OF  A HUMAN FOETAL FINGER.[A] _a_, The nail; _b_, the rete mucosum; _c_, the  longitudinal ridges of the corium.]    [Footnote A: Seeing that the section is a longitudinal one, it would appear  from the way the ridges cut that they are running transversely beneath the  nail. Their extreme delicacy, however, prevents a single one showing itself  along the length of the section, and their constant accidental cutting  makes them _appear_ to run transversely (H.C.R.).]    THE HUMAN NAILS are thickenings of the lowermost layer of the horny portion  of the epidermis, the stratum lucidum. They are developed over a modified  portion of the corium known as the nail-bed. The horny substance of the  nail is composed of clear horny cells,"]]]
