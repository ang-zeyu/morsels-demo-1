Now Signy and the king had two children of tender age, who played with  a golden toy on the floor, and bowled it along the pavement of the hall,  running along with it; but therewith a golden ring from off it trundles  away into the place where Sigmund and Sinfjotli lay, and off runs the  little one to search for the same, and beholds withal where two men are  sitting, big and grimly to look on, with overhanging helms and bright  white byrnies; (2) so he runs up the hall to his father, and tells him  of the sight he has seen, and thereat the king misdoubts of some guile  abiding him; but Signy heard their speech, and arose and took both the  children, and went out into the porch to them and said--    \"Lo ye! These younglings have bewrayed you; come now therefore and slay  them!\"    Sigmund says, \"Never will I slay thy children for telling of where I lay  hid.\"    But Sinfjotli made little enow of it, but drew his sword and slew them  both, and cast them into the hall at King Siggeir's feet.    Then up stood the king and cried on his men to take those who had lain  privily in the porch through the night. So they ran thither and would  lay hands on them, but they stood on their defence well and manly, and  long he remembered it who was the nighest to them; but in the end they  were borne down by many men and taken, and bonds were set upon them, and  they were cast into fetters wherein they sit night long.    Then the king ponders what longest and worst of deaths he shall mete out  to them; and when morning came he let make a great barrow of stones and  turf; and when it was done, let set a great flat stone midmost inside  thereof, so that one edge was aloft, the other alow; and so great it was  that it went from wall to wall, so that none might pass it.    Now he bids folk take Sigmund and Sinfjotli and set them in the barrow,  on either side of the stone, for the worse for them he deemed it, that  they might hear each the other's speech, and yet that neither might pass  one to the other. But now, while they were covering in the barrow with  the turf-slips, thither came Signy, bearing straw with her, and cast it  down to Sinfjotli, and bade the thralls hide this thing from the king;  they said yea thereto, and therewithal was the barrow closed in.    But when night fell, Sinfjotli said to Sigmund, \"Belike we shall scarce  need meat for a while, for here has the queen cast swine's flesh into  the barrow, and wrapped it round about on the outer side with straw.\"    Therewith he handles the flesh and finds that therein was thrust  Sigmund's sword; and he knew it by the hilts, as mirk as it might be in  the barrow, and tells Sigmund thereof, and of that were they both fain  enow.    Now Sinfjotli drave the point of the sword up into the big stone, and  drew it hard along, and the sword bit on the stone. With that Sigmund  caught the sword by the point, and in this wise they sawed the stone  between them, and let not or all the sawing was done that need be done,  even as the song sings:         \"Sinfjotli sawed       And Sigmund sawed,       Atwain with main       The stone was done.\"    Now are they both together loose in the barrow, and soon they cut both  through stone and through iron, and bring themselves out thereof. Then  they go home to the hall, whenas all men slept there, and bear wood to  the hall, and lay fire therein; and withal the folk therein are waked by  the smoke, and by the hall burning over their heads.    Then the king cries out, \"Who kindled this fire, I burn withal?\"    \"Here am I,\" says Sigmund, \"with Sinfjotli, my sister's son; and we are  minded that thou shalt wot well that all the Volsungs are not yet dead.\"    Then he bade his sister come out, and take all good things at his hands,  and great honour, and fair atonement in that wise, for all her griefs.    But she answered, \"Take heed now, and consider, if I have kept King  Siggeir in memory, and his slaying of Volsung the king! I let slay both  my children, whom I deemed worthless for the revenging of our father,  and I went into the wood to thee in a witch-wife's shape; and now  behold, Sinfjotli is the son of thee and of me both! and therefore has  he this so great hardihood and fierceness, in that he is the son both of  Volsung's son and Volsung's daughter; and for this, and for naught else,  have I so wrought, that Siggeir might get his bane at last; and all  these things have I done that vengeance might fall on him, and that I  too might not live long; and merrily now will I die with King Siggeir,  though I was naught merry to wed him.\"    Therewith she kissed Sigmund her brother, and Sinfjotli, and went back  again into the fire, and there she died with King Siggeir and all his  good men.    But the two kinsmen gathered together folk and ships, and Sigmund went  back to his father's land, and drave away thence the king, who had set  himself down there in the room of king Volsung.    So Sigmund became a mighty King and far-famed, wise and high-minded: he  had to wife one named Borghild, and two sons they had between them, one  named Helgi and the other Hamund; and when Helgi was born, Norns came to  him, (3) and spake over him, and said that he should be in time to come  the most renowned of all kings. Even therewith was Sigmund come home  from the wars, and so therewith he gives him the name of Helgi, and  these matters as tokens thereof, Land of Rings, Sun-litten Hill, and  Sharp-shearing Sword, and withal prayed that he might grow of great  fame, and like unto the kin of the Volsungs.    And so it was that he grew up high-minded, and well-beloved, and above  all other men in all prowess; and the story tells that he went to the  wars when he was fifteen winters old. Helgi was lord and ruler over the  army, but Sinfjotli was gotten to be his fellow herein; and so the twain  bare sway thereover.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  \"Skin-changers\" were universally believed in once, in         Iceland no less than elsewhere, as see Ari in several places         of his history, especially the episode of Dufthach and         Storwolf o' Whale.  Men possessing the power of becoming         wolves at intervals, in the present case compelled so to         become, wer-wolves or \"loupsgarou\", find large place in         medieval story, but were equally well-known in classic         times.  Belief in them still lingers in parts of Europe         where wolves are to be found.  Herodotus tells of the Neuri,         who assumed once a year the shape of wolves; Pliny says that         one of the family of Antaeus, chosen by lot annually, became         a wolf, and so remained for nine years; Giraldus Cambrensis         will have it that Irishmen may become wolves; and Nennius         asserts point-blank that \"the descendants of wolves are         still in Ossory;\" they retransform themselves into wolves         when they bite.  Apuleius, Petronius, and Lucian have         similar stories.  The Emperor Sigismund convoked a council         of theologians in the fifteenth century who decided that         wer-wolves did exist.    (2)  Byrny (A.S. \"byrne\"), corslet, cuirass.

They sit beside the         fountain of Urd (\"Urdarbrunur\"), which is below one of the         roots of \"Yggdrasil\", the world-tree, which tree their         office it is to nourish by sprinkling it with the waters of         the fountain.        CHAPTER IX. How Helgi, the son of Sigmund, won King Hodbrod and his  Realm, and wedded Sigrun.    Now the tale tells that Helgi in his warring met a king hight Hunding,  a mighty king, and lord of many men and many lands; they fell to battle  together, and Helgi went forth mightily, and such was the end of that  fight that Helgi had the victory, but King Hunding fell and many of his  men with him; but Helgi is deemed to have grown greatly in fame because  he had slain so mighty a king.    Then the sons of Hunding draw together a great army to avenge their  father. Hard was the fight betwixt them; but Helgi goes through the  folk of those brothers unto their banner, and there slays these sons  of Hunding, Alf and Eyolf, Herward and Hagbard, and wins there a great  victory.    Now as Helgi fared from the fight, he met a many women right fair and  worthy to look on, who rode in exceeding noble array; but one far  excelled them all; then Helgi asked them the name of that their lady and  queen, and she named herself Sigrun, and said she was daughter of King  Hogni.    Then said Helgi, \"Fare home with us: good welcome shall ye have!\"    Then said the king's daughter, \"Other work lies before us than to drink  with thee.\"    \"Yea, and what work, king's daughter?\" said Helgi.    She answers, \"King Hogni has promised me to Hodbrod, the son of King  Granmar, but I have vowed a vow that I will have him to my husband no  more than if he were a crow's son and not a king's; and yet will the  thing come to pass, but and if thou standest in the way thereof, and  goest against him with an army, and takest me away withal; for verily  with no king would I rather bide on bolster than with thee.\"    \"Be of good cheer, king's daughter,\" says he, \"for certes he and I shall  try the matter, or ever thou be given to him; yea, we shall behold which  may prevail against the other; and hereto I pledge my life.\"    Thereafter, Helgi sent men with money in their hands to summon his folk  to him, and all his power is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#9)"],[1," many things in Goa that stood me in good stead  in later life and it will always remain etched in my  memory as a part of my youth.    I wish all my friends and acquaintances over there,  especially Rajan Narayan, good health and success in  whatever they are engaged in now! I learnt of  Mudaliar's death quite recently through an e-mail. I  was saddened. I fondly recall my association with him.  Despite the differences of opinion that resulted in our  parting of ways, Mudaliar was a thorough gentleman and  working with him was an enriching experience. I cherish  his memories!      Chapter 6:  oHERALDo: an untold chapter    Valmiki FaleiroValmiki Faleiro, a Goa-based working journalist between  1975-83, covered Goa for national publications like The  Current Weekly, the Free Press Journal group and the  Indian Express. He was Staff Reporter with the West  Coast Times and as a freelancer, contributed to various  journals like The Navhind Times, Goa Today, The Sun  Weekly, Newstrek, Detective Digest, Mirror, Newsmag.    The early 1980s. Happy days were here again for Goa's  first English-language daily, The Navhind Times (NT).  After a brief challenge to its other crucial attribute,  that of being the only English-language daily, from Goa Monitor   in the late 1960s, NT had just staved off another.  West Coast Times, launched July-1978, blazed a luminous  trail in quality journalism but, like a comet after a  brief showing, vanished into oblivion.    NT was back to its snug-seat monopoly.    A slave of the economic thought of Adam Smith, David  Ricardo and John Stuart Mill, or our own Nani  Palkhivala, JRD Tata and M.R. Pai, I have been a votary  of free enterprise and competition -- and allergic to  monopolies. A monopoly is bad for any consumer. And  infinitely worse in a crucial commodity that helps form  a society's opinion.    I had been speaking to some wealthier Goans, my idea of  launching a broadsheet weekly, which would, over a  period, be converted to a full-fledged daily. A tabloid  (like Goa Monitor) did not appeal; and mere excellence  in editorial content and quality printing (like West  Coast Times) did not suffice. What mattered was the  capacity to financially sustain a daily newspaper (by  absorbing annual losses even while continuing to  maintain quality) until the product turned round, which  could take some years. That kind of money in Goa only mineowners   had -- like all of Goa's major dailies! So my idea was  start small, stay around till you built adequate  advertising recognition and support, and only then  convert to a daily -- at a fraction of a daily's  budgetary requirement and without having to own  printing facilities from day one.    Even then, not many Goan businessmen I was in touch  with were willing to risk any substantial venture capital.    It was around this time, June 1983, if I recall the  month correctly, that a mutual friend in the printing  business in Mumbai and Goa, told me that A.C. Fernandes,  Patrao of the Panjim stationers Casa J.D. Fernandes,  was toying with the idea of an English-language daily.  The mutual friend suggested I discuss my ideas with Fernandes.    A.C. Fernandes wasn't a mineowner, not yet anyway, but  I had heard he was a shrewd businessman. He purchased  Goa's only extant Portuguese-language daily, O Heraldo,  not so much for love of the language or its dwindling  local readership, but evidently for the intrinsic value  of its press and its centrally-located premises. It was  said he took full advantage of the daily's lable, in  those days of the Permit Raj, to import (from Italy?) a  Lino typesetting machine, which actually was used for  all and sundry job works of the business house -- even  as the major part of good ole O Heraldo continued to be composed   by hand!    But what the heck! A shrewd and street-smart man, I  reckoned, would any day be better than a cash-filled  dumbo. Moreover, what Patrao may have lacked by way of  adequate resources was made up in having his priorities  right. His love Goa and her way of life, his concern  about increasing corruption in Goa's polity and  aspiration for rightful honour to the mother tongue,  were transparently genuine.    The mutual friend arranged our introductory meeting,  over lunch at the A.C. Fernandes residence at Santa Cruz   one rainy Sunday. The sharp-eyed (and, as I was later  to discover, sharp-tempered) Patrao, his demure wife  and sons, John, Raul and Oswald, with the mutual friend  and I sat across a carefully laid table. I spoke about  WCT and why it failed, my ideas for a successful daily  and my business plan for such a venture. A.C. Fernandes  (the sons, those days, played second fiddle), I think,  was impressed. And thus began a relationship, where I  did my best to midwife a second English-language daily  for Goa -- or almost.    The search was on for an Editor. Ads had been placed in  the major national dailies. Surprisingly, about a dozen  pros were willing to come to Goa! But the best were out  of reckoning, they expected salaries the kind Patrao  never figured existed! Ervelle Menezes was the best  bet. When I covered Goa for the Indian Express a couple  of years before, Ervelle was a Chief Sub at IE's Mumbai  edition. After Bhat, the then News Editor, died in  harness, Ervelle had taken over as the News Editor and  was in that position at this point of time.    From deep within, I hoped that Ervelle it would be to  launch the Herald as its founding editor. A  professional and a Goan, he was a suitable choice. For  me too: I had been, by now, ordained to be the to-be  newspaper's Chief Reporter, on insistence of A.C. Fernandes   and his son Raul. My own plan had been to be with them  till the day the newspaper took off; I was, by this  time, already getting into business, developing  family-owned land at Fatorda, Margao.    I never met or spoke to Ervelle about this job. Raul  had, and I gathered that Ervelle was indeed interested.  I was aware that he had come to Goa to check things  out. Ervelle, of course, is around and it would be for  him to say why he declined. What I surmised at that  time, though, was that Ervelle must have been put off  by local opinion about A.C. Fernandes' financial  capacity to sustain a daily newspaper to the stage it  generated its own resources. Ervelle of course  explained it had something to do with his mother's illness.    Ervelle's decision was a great setback to the plan --  there was just one last application left in Raul's file  of responses for the Editor's post. If I had not urged  its consideration earlier, it was because the applicant  lacked experience with a daily newspaper. The  applicant's only exposure to a daily was a brief stint  at the Financial Express -- not a mainstream newspaper.  His c.v. spoke of experience at Mirror. But then,  magazine journalism is not the same as what goes into  the making of a daily newspaper. Moreover, the  applicant wasn't even into journalism for quite some  time: he presently dwelt in the dreary world of  advertising and public relations, at one of Mumbai's  lesser-known firms. Such was the irony.    What the NT had been to Goa's English readers, a  Hobson's choice, Rajan Narayan's application now was to  Raul and me!    Fearing that Patrao may get discouraged enough to  abandon the newspaper idea, my airflow changed and I  convinced A.C. Fernandes that we invite the man and  take a closer look at his credentials. Rajan was lodged  at Panjim's Hotel Mandovi (I wonder if he ever stayed  there again, used as in later years he was to offered  or obtained five-star hospitality across Goa's coast!)  Patrao, Raul and I met him. The parleys went so long in  the afternoon that there was no restaurant open for  lunch. Rajan and I had to make do with puri bhaji at  Cafe Real (I wonder, again, how he'd have raved and  ranted in his latter-day popular Sunday column, Stray Thoughts  . But beggars were not choosers, those days.)    To me, Rajan came out as a clever and crafty mind. But  again, what the heck! At that point of time, the NT had  a clever and resourceful skipper at its helm. I had  known Bikram Vohra from my days at the Indian Express.  When marched to Ahmedabad as Resident Editor of the  IE's local edition, to fend off competition from the  formidable Times of India, one could count on Bikram to  come up with extremely off-beat ideas: he painted the  town red with the slogan, Keen ahead of the times, read  the Express! To compete, we would need a crafty mind  and I though Rajan fitted that bill pretty well. From  me, Rajan wanted to learn more about Goa --- its  history, economy, religions, cultural mix the  background of its English-language press and, of  course, of the A.C. Fernandes clan.    Rajan was obviously impressed with my views on how the  newspaper should be. He said he was immensely happy to  have me around, that things would be difficult talking  to A.C. Fernandes and Raul alone. He was also glad I  would be the newspaper's Chief Staff Reporter. He  pleaded that I stay back in Panjim that day, so we  could discuss in greater detail. The kid that Raul then  was, also decided to stay back. We sat in Rajan's  Mandovi room, drinking his favourite Old Monk (not  Raul, then a teetotaler, I don't know if he's still one.)    We were immersed in plans and strategy, more than in  the rum.    It was well past 9 p.m. and there was a knock on the  door. Being closer, I rose to answer, but obsequious as  Raul was, insisted on doing that himself. Raul had  barely opened the door when we heard the sonics of a  resounding slap across the face. A furious A.C.  Fernandes hollered, \"Mama and I were so worried about  you.\" (It seems those days the Fernandes household was  being terrorized by another Fernandes household in the  Santa Cruz neighbourhood, so much that no member of the  former went home unaccompanied after dusk; if late, a  group of employees from the shop or press escorted them"]]]
