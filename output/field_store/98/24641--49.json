Among the  individuals of the same species that come under our notice, no two  resemble exactly; and it is therefore evident that the difference  of situation alone will, necessarily, carry a diversity more or less  sensible, not only in the modifications, but also in the essence, in  the properties, in the entire system of beings. This truth was well  understood by the profound and subtle LEIBNITZ.    If this principle be properly digested, and experience seems always to  produce evidence of its truth, we must be convinced that the matter or  primitive elements which enter into the composition of bodies, are  not of the same nature, and consequently, can neither have the same  properties, nor the same modifications; and if so, they cannot have  the same mode of moving and acting. Their activity or motion, already  different, can be diversified to infinity, augmented or diminished,  accelerated or retarded, according to the combinations, the proportions,  the pressure, the density, the volume of the matter, that enters their  composition. The endless variety to be produced, will need no further  illustration than the commonest book of arithmetic furnishes us, where  it will be found, that to ring all the changes that can be produced on  twelve bells only, would occupy a space of more than ninety-one years.  The element of fire is visibly more active and more inconstant than that  of earth. This is more solid and ponderous than fire, air, or water.  According to the quantity of these elements, which enter the composition  of bodies, these must act diversely, and their motion must in some  measure partake the motion peculiar to each of their constituent parts.  Elementary fire appears to be in Nature the principle of activity;  it may be compared to a fruitful leaven, that puts the mass into  fermentation and gives it life. Earth appears to be the principle of  solidity in bodies, from its impenetrability, and by the firm coherence  of its parts. Water is a medium, to facilitate the combination of  bodies, into which it enters itself, as a constituent part. Air is a  fluid whose business it seems to be, to furnish the other elements with  the space requisite to expand, to exercise their motion, and which is,  moreover, found proper to combine with them. These elements, which  our senses never discover in a pure state--which are continually and  reciprocally set in motion by each other--which are always acting and  re-acting, combining and separating, attracting and repelling--are  sufficient to explain to us the formation of all the beings we behold.  Their motion is uninterruptedly and reciprocally produced from each  other; they are alternately causes and effects. Thus, they form a vast  circle of generation and destruction--of combination and decomposition,  which, it is quite reasonable to suppose, could never have had a  beginning, and which, consequently can never have an end. In short,  Nature is but an immense chain of causes and effects, which unceasingly  flow from each other. The motion of particular beings depends on the  general motion, which is itself maintained by individual motion. This  is strengthened or weakened, accelerated or retarded, simplified or  complicated, procreated or destroyed, by a variety of combinations and  circumstances, which every moment change the directions, the tendency,  the modes of existing, and of acting, of the different beings that  receive its impulse.    If it were true, as has been asserted by some philosophers, that every  thing has a tendency to form one unique or single mass, and in that  unique mass the instant should arrive when all was in _nisus_, all would  eternally remain in this state; to all eternity there would be no more  than one Being and one effort: this would be eternal and universal  death.    If we desire to go beyond this, to find the principle of action in  matter, to trace the origin of things, it is for ever to fall back upon  difficulties; it is absolutely to abridge the evidence of our senses; by  which only we can understand, by which alone we can judge of the causes  acting upon them, or the impulse by which they are set in action.    Let us, therefore, content ourselves with saying WHAT is supported by  our experience, and by all the evidence we are capable of understanding;  against the truth of which not a shadow of proof, such as our reason can  admit, has ever been adduced--which has been maintained by philosophers  in every age--which theologians themselves have not denied, but which  many of them have upheld; namely, that _matter always existed; that  it moves by virtue of its essence; that all the phenomena of Nature  is ascribable to the diversified motion of the variety of matter she  contains; and which, like the phoenix, is continually regenerating out  of its own ashes._            CHAP. III.    _Of Matter.--Of its various Combinations.--Of its diversified Motion, or  of the Course of Nature._      We know nothing of the elements of bodies, but we know some of their  properties or qualities; and we distinguish their various matter by the  effect or change produced on our senses; that is to say, by the variety  of motion their presence excites in us. In consequence, we discover  in them, extent, mobility, divisibility, solidity, gravity, and inert  force. From these general and primitive properties flow a number  of others, such as density, figure, colour, ponderosity, &c. Thus,  relatively to us, matter is all that affects our senses in any manner  whatever; the various properties we attribute to matter, by which we  discriminate its diversity, are founded on the different impressions we  receive on the changes they produce in us.    A satisfactory definition of matter has not yet been given. Man,  deceived and led astray by his prejudices, formed but vague,  superficial, and imperfect notions concerning it. He looked upon it  as an unique being, gross and passive, incapable of either moving by  itself, of forming combinations, or of producing any thing by its  own energies. Instead of this unintelligible jargon, he ought to have  contemplated it as a _genus_ of beings, of which the individuals,  although they might possess some common properties, such as extent,  divisibility, figure, &c. should not, however, be all ranked in the same  class, nor comprised under the same general denomination.    An example will serve more fully to explain what we have asserted,  throw its correctness into light, and facilitate the application.  The properties common to all matter, are extent, divisibility,  impenetrability, figure, mobility, or the property of being moved in  mass. FIRE, beside these general properties, common to all matter,  enjoys also the peculiar property of being put into activity by a motion  that produces on our organs of feeling the sensation of heat; and by  another, that communicates to our visual organs the sensation of light.  Iron, in common with matter in general, has extent and figure; is  divisible, and moveable in mass: if fire be combined with it in a  certain proportion, the iron acquires two new properties; namely, those  of exciting in us similar sensations of heat and light, which were  excited by the element of fire, but which the iron had not, before its  combination with the igneous matter. These distinguishing properties  are inseparable from matter, and the phenomena that result, may, in the  strictest sense of the word, be said to result necessarily.    If we contemplate a little the paths of Nature--if, for a time, we trace  the beings in this Nature, under the different states through which,  by reason of their properties, they are compelled to pass; we shall  discover, that it is to motion, and motion only, that is to be ascribed  all the changes, all the combinations, all the forms, in short, all the  various modifications of matter. That it is by motion every thing that  exists is produced, experiences change, expands, and is destroyed. It  is motion that alters the aspect of beings; that adds to, or takes away  from their properties; which obliges each of them, by a consequence of  its nature, after having occupied a certain rank or order, to quit it,  to occupy another, and to contribute to the generation, maintenance, and  decomposition of other beings, totally different in their bulk, rank,  and essence.    In what experimental philosophers have styled the THREE ORDERS OF  NATURE, that is to say, the _mineral_, the _vegetable_, and _animal_  worlds, they have established, by the aid of motion, a transmigration,  an exchange, a continual circulation in the particles of matter. Nature  has occasion in one place, for those particles which, for a time, she  has placed in another. These particles, after having, by particular  combinations, constituted beings endued with peculiar essences, with  specific properties, with determinate modes of action, dissolve and  separate with more or less facility; and combining in a new manner, they  form new beings. The attentive observer sees this law execute itself, in  a manner more or less prominent, through all the beings by which he is  surrounded. He sees nature full of _erratic germe_, some of which expand  themselves, whilst others wait until motion has placed them in their  proper situation, in suitable wombs or matrices, in the necessary  circumstances, to unfold, to increase, to render them more perceptible  by the addition of other substances of matter analogous to their  primitive being. In all this we see nothing but the effect of motion,  necessarily guided, modified, accelerated or slackened, strengthened or  weakened, by reason of the various properties that beings successively  acquire and lose; which, every moment, infallibly produces alterations  in bodies more or less marked. Indeed, these bodies cannot be, strictly  speaking, the same in any two successive moments of their existence;  they must, every"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#8)"],[1," to the ancients, and was what gave rise to what they called  their great year, which the Egyptians fixed at thirty-six thousand five  hundred and twenty-five years: the Sabines at thirty-six thousand four  hundred and twenty-five, whilst others have extended it to one hundred  thousand, some even to seven hundred and fifty-three thousand years.  Again, to those general revolutions which our planet has at different  times experienced, way he added those that have been partial, such as  inundations of the sea, earthquakes, subterraneous conflagrations, which  have sometimes had the effect of dispersing particular nations, and  to make them forget all those sciences with which they were, before  acquainted. It is also probable that the first volcanic fires, having  had no previous vent, were more central, and greater in quantity, before  they burst the crust of earth; as the sea washed the whole, it must  have rapidly sunk down into every opening, where, falling on the boiling  lava, it was instantly expanded into steam, producing irresistible  explosion: whence it is reasonable to conclude, that the primaeval  earthquakes wore more widely extended, and of much greater force, than  those which occur in our days. Other vapours may be produced by intense  heat, possessing a much greater elasticity, from substances that  evaporate, such as mercury, diamonds, &c.; the expansive force of these  vapours would be much greater than the steam of water, even at red hot  heat consequently they, way have had sufficient energy to raise islands,  continents, or even to have detached the moon from the earth; if the  moon, as has been supposed by some philosophers, was thrown out of the  great cavity which now contains the South Sea; the immense quantity of  water flowing in from the original ocean, and which then covered the  earth, would much contribute to leave the continents and islands, which  might be raised at the same time, above the surface of the water. In  later days we have accounts of huge stones falling, from the firmament,  which may have been thrown by explosion from some distant earthquake,  without having been impelled with a force sufficient to cause them to  circulate round the earth, and thus produce numerous small moons or  satellites.    Those who were able to escape from the ruin of the world, filled  with consternation, plunged in misery, were but little conditioned to  preserve to their posterity a knowledge, effaced by those misfortunes,  of which they had been both the victims and the witnesses: overwhelmed  with dismay, trembling with fear, they were not able to hand down the  history of their frightful adventures, except by obscure traditions;  much less to transmit to us the opinions, the systems, the arts, the  sciences, anterior to these petrifying revolutions of our sphere. There  have been perhaps men upon the earth from all eternity; but at different  periods they may have been nearly annihilated, together with their  monuments, their sciences, and their arts; those who outlived these  periodical revolutions, each time formed a new race of men, who by dint  of time, labour, and experience, have by degrees withdrawn from  oblivion the inventions of the primitive races. It is, perhaps, to these  periodical revolutions of the human species, that is to be ascribed the  profound ignorance in which we see man yet plunged, upon those objects  that are the most interesting to him. This is, perhaps, the true source  of the imperfection of his knowledge--of the vices of his political  institutions--of the defect in his religion--of the growth of  superstition, over which terror has always presided; here, in all  probability, is the cause of that puerile inexperience, of those jejune  prejudices, which almost every where keep man in a state of infancy, and  which render him so little capable of either listening to reason or  of consulting truth. To judge by the slowness of his progress, by  the feebleness of his advance, in a number of respects, we should be  inclined to say, the human race has either just quitted its cradle, or  that he was never destined to attain the age of virility--to corroborate  his reason.    However it may be with these conjectures, whether the human race may  always have existed upon the earth, whether it may have been a recent  production of nature, whether the larger animals we now behold were  originally derived from the smallest microscopic ones, who have  increased in bulk with the progression of time, or whether, as the  Egyptian philosophers thought, mankind were originally hermaphrodites,  who like the _aphis_ produced the sexual distinction after some  generations, which was also the opinion of Plato, and seems to have  been that of Moses, who was educated amongst these Egyptians, as may be  gathered from the 27th and 28th verses of the first chapter of GENESIS:  \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he  him; male and female created he them--And GOD blessed them, and GOD  said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and  subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl  of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth:\" it  is not therefore presuming too much to suppose, as the Egyptians were  a nation very fond of explaining their opinions by hieroglyphics,  that that part which describes Eve as taken out of Adam's rib, was an  hieroglyphic emblem: showing that mankind was in the primitive state of  both sexes, united, who was afterwards divided into males and females.  However, I say, this may be, it is extremely easy to recur to the origin  of many existing nations: we shall find them always in the savage state;  that is, to say, dispersed; composed of families detached from each  other; of wandering, hordes; these were collected together, approximated  at the voice of some missionary or legislator, from whom they  received great benefits, who gave them gods, opinions, and laws. These  personages, of whom the people newly congregated readily acknowledged  the superiority, fixed the national gods, leaving to each individual,  those which he had formed to himself, according to his own peculiar  ideas, or else substituting others brought from those regions, from  whence they themselves had emigrated.    The better to imprint their lessons on the minds of their new subjects,  these men became the guides, the priests, the sovereigns, the masters  of these infant societies; they formed discourses by which they spoke to  the imagination of their willing auditors. POETRY seem best adapted to  strike the mind of these rude people, to engrave on their memory those  ideas with which they were willing to imbue them: its images, its  fictions, its numbers, its rhyme its harmony, all conspired to please  their fancy, to render permanent the impressions it made: thus, the  entire of nature, as well as all its parts, was personified, by its  beautiful allegories: at its soothing voice, trees, stones, rocks,  earth, air, fire, water, by imagination took intelligence, held  conversation with man, and with themselves; the elements were deified by  its songs, every thing was figuratively detailed in harmonious lays.  The sky, which according to the then philosophy, was an arched concave,  spreading over the earth, which was supposed to be a level plain; (for  the doctrine of _antipodes_ is of rather modern date) was itself made  a god; was considered a more suitable residence, as making a greater  distinction for these imaginary deities than the earth on which man  himself resided. Thus the firmament was filled with deities.    Time, under the name of Saturn, was pictured as the son of heaven;  or Coelus by earth, called Terra, or Thea; he was represented as  an inexorable divinity--naturally artful, who devoured his own  children--who revenged the anger of his mother upon his father; for  which purpose she armed him with a scythe, formed of metals drawn from  her own bowels, with which he struck Coelus, in the act of uniting  himself to Thea, and so mutilated him, that he was ever after  incapacitated to increase the number of his children: he was said to  have divided the throne with Janus king of Italy, his reign seems to  have been so mild, so beneficent, that it was called the _golden  age_; human victims were sacrificed on his altars, until abolished by  Hercules, who substituted small images of clay. Festivals in honor of  this god, called Saturnalia, were instituted long antecedent to the  foundation of Rome they were celebrated about the middle of December,  either on the 16th, 17th, or 18th; they lasted in latter times  several days, originally but one. Universal liberty prevailed at the  celebration, slaves were permitted to ridicule their masters--to speak  freely on every subject--no criminals were executed--war never declared;  the priests made their human offerings with their heads uncovered; a  circumstance peculiar to the Saturnalia, not adopted at other festivals.    The igneous matter, the etherial electric fluid, that invisible fire  which vivifies nature, that penetrates all beings, that fertilizes the  earth, which is the great principle of motion, the source of heat, was  deified under the name of Jupiter: his combination with every being in  nature was expressed by his metamorphoses--by the frequent adulteries  imputed to him. He was armed with thunder, to indicate he produced  meteors, to typify the electric fluid that is called lightning. He  married the winds, which were designated under the name of Juno,  therefore called the Goddess of the Winds, their nuptials were  celebrated with great solemnity; all the gods, the entire brute  creation, the whole of mankind attended, except one young woman named  Chelone, who laughed at the ceremonies, for which impiety she was  changed by Mercury into a tortoise, and condemned to perpetual silence.  He was the most powerful"]]]
