A faithful wife who  wishes to attain in heaven the mansion of her husband, must do nothing  unkind to him, be he living or dead; let her not, when her lord is  deceased, even pronounce the name of another man; let her continue till  death, forgiving all injuries, performing harsh duties, avoiding every  sensual pleasure, and cheerfully practising the incomparable rules of  virtue.... The soul itself is its own witness, the soul itself is its  own refuge; offend not thy conscious soul, the supreme internal witness  of man, ... O friend to virtue, the Supreme Spirit, which is the same  as thyself, resides in thy bosom perpetually, and is an all-knowing  inspector of thy goodness or wickedness.\"    Such were the truths uttered on the banks of the Ganges one thousand  years before Christ. But with these views there is an exaltation of the  Brahmanical or sacerdotal life, hard to be distinguished from the  recognition of divine qualities. \"From his high birth,\" says Menu, \"a  Brahman is an object of veneration, even to deities.\" Hence, great  things are expected of him; his food must be roots and fruit, his  clothing of bark fibres; he must spend his time in reading the Vedas; he  is to practise austerities by exposing himself to heat and cold; he is  to beg food but once a day; he must be careful not to destroy the life  of the smallest insect; he must not taste intoxicating liquors. A  Brahman who has thus mortified his body by these modes is exalted into  the divine essence. This was the early creed of the Brahman before  corruption set in. And in these things we see a striking resemblance to  the doctrines of Buddha. Had there been no corruption of Brahmanism,  there would have been no Buddhism; for the principles of Buddhism, were  those of early Brahmanism.    But Brahmanism became corrupted. Like the Mosaic Law, under the sedulous  care of the sacerdotal orders it ripened into a most burdensome  ritualism. The Brahmanical caste became tyrannical, exacting, and  oppressive. With the supposed sacredness of his person, and with the  laws made in his favor, the Brahman became intolerable to the people,  who were ground down by sacrifices, expiatory offerings, and wearisome  and minute ceremonies of worship. Caste destroyed all ideas of human  brotherhood; it robbed the soul of its affections and its aspirations.  Like the Pharisees in the time of Jesus, the Brahmans became oppressors  of the people. As in Pagan Egypt and in Christian mediaeval Europe, the  priests held the keys of heaven and hell; their power was more than  Druidical.    But the Brahman, when true to the laws of Menu, led in one sense a lofty  life. Nor can we despise a religion which recognized the value and  immortality of the soul, a state of future rewards and punishments,  though its worship was encumbered by rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices.  It was spiritual in its essential peculiarities, having reference to  another world rather than to this, which is more than we can say of the  religion of the Greeks; it was not worldly in its ends, seeking to save  the soul rather than to pamper the body; it had aspirations after a  higher life; it was profoundly reverential, recognizing a supreme  intelligence and power, indefinitely indeed, but sincerely,--not an  incarnated deity like the Zeus of the Greeks, but an infinite Spirit,  pervading the universe. The pantheism of the Brahmans was better than  the godless materialism of the Chinese. It aspired to rise to a  knowledge of God as the supremest wisdom and grandest attainment of  mortal man. It made too much of sacrifices; but sacrifices were common  to all the ancient religions except the Persian.         \"He who through knowledge or religious acts       Henceforth attains to immortality,       Shall first present his body, Death, to thee.\"    Whether human sacrifices were offered in India when the Vedas were  composed we do not know, but it is believed to be probable. The oldest  form of sacrifice was the offering of food to the deity. Dr. H. C.  Trumbull, in his work on \"The Blood Covenant,\" thinks that the origin of  animal sacrifices was like that of circumcision,--a pouring out of blood  (the universal, ancient symbol of _life_) as a sign of devotion to the  deity; and the substitution of animals was a natural and necessary mode  of making this act of consecration a frequent and continuing one. This  presents a nobler view of the whole sacrificial system than the common  one. Yet doubtless the latter soon prevailed; for following upon the  devoted life-offerings to the Divine Friend, came propitiatory rites to  appease divine anger or gain divine favor. Then came in the natural  human self-seeking of the sacerdotal class, for the multiplication of  sacrifices tended to exalt the priesthood, and thus to perpetuate caste.    Again, the Brahmans, if practising austerities to weaken sensual  desires, like the monks of Syria and Upper Egypt, were meditative and  intellectual; they evolved out of their brains whatever was lofty in  their system of religion and philosophy. Constant and profound  meditation on the soul, on God, and on immortality was not without its  natural results. They explored the world of metaphysical speculation.  There is scarcely an hypothesis advanced by philosophers in ancient or  modern times, which may not be found in the Brahmanical writings. \"We  find in the writings of these Hindus materialism, atomism, pantheism,  Pyrrhonism, idealism. They anticipated Plato, Kant, and Hegel. They  could boast of their Spinozas and their Humes long before Alexander  dreamed of crossing the Indus. From them the Pythagoreans borrowed a  great part of their mystical philosophy, of their doctrine of  transmigration of souls, and the unlawfulness of eating animal food.  From them Aristotle learned the syllogism.... In India the human mind  exhausted itself in attempting to detect the laws which regulate its  operation, before the philosophers of Greece were beginning to enter the  precincts of metaphysical inquiry.\" This intellectual subtlety, acumen,  and logical power the Brahmans never lost. To-day the Christian  missionary finds them his superiors in the sports of logical  tournaments, whenever the Brahman condescends to put forth his powers of  reasoning.    Brahmanism carried idealism to the extent of denying any reality to  sense or matter, declaring that sense is a delusion. It sought to leave  the soul emancipated from desire, from a material body, in a state which  according to Indian metaphysics is _being_, but not _existence_. Desire,  anger, ignorance, evil thoughts are consumed by the fire of knowledge.    But I will not attempt to explain the ideal pantheism which Brahmanical  philosophers substituted for the Nature-worship taught in the earlier  Vedas. This proved too abstract for the people; and the Brahmans, in the  true spirit of modern Jesuitism, wishing to accommodate their religion  to the people,--who were in bondage to their tyranny, and who have ever  been inclined to sensuous worship,--multiplied their sacrifices and  sacerdotal rites, and even permitted a complicated polytheism. Gradually  piety was divorced from morality. Siva and Vishnu became worshipped, as  well as Brahma and a host of other gods unknown to the earlier Vedas.    In the sixth century before Christ, the corruption of society had become  so flagrant under the teachings and government of the Brahmans, that a  reform was imperatively needed. \"The pride of race had put an  impassable barrier between the Aryan-Hindus and the conquered  aborigines, while the pride of both had built up an equally impassable  barrier between the different classes among the Aryan people  themselves.\" The old childlike joy in life, so manifest in the Vedas,  had died away. A funereal gloom hung over the land; and the gloomiest  people of all were the Brahmans themselves, devoted to a complicated  ritual of ceremonial observances, to needless and cruel sacrifices, and  a repulsive theology. The worship of Nature had degenerated into the  worship of impure divinities. The priests were inflated with a puerile  but sincere belief in their own divinity, and inculcated a sense of duty  which was nothing else than a degrading slavery to their own caste.    Under these circumstances Buddhism arose as a protest against  Brahmanism. But it was rather an ethical than a religious movement; it  was an attempt to remove misery from the world, and to elevate ordinary  life by a reform of morals. It was effected by a prince who goes by the  name of Buddha,--the \"Enlightened,\"--who was supposed by his later  followers to be an incarnation of Deity, miraculously conceived, and  sent into the world to save men. He was nearly contemporary with  Confucius, although the Buddhistic doctrines were not introduced into  China until about two hundred years before the Christian era. He is  supposed to have belonged to a warlike tribe called Sakyas, of great  reputed virtue, engaged in agricultural pursuits, who had entered  northern India and made a permanent settlement several hundred years  before. The name by which the reformer is generally known is Gautama,  borrowed by the Sakyas after their settlement in India from one of the  ancient Vedic bard-families. The foundation of our knowledge of Sakya  Buddha is from a Life of him by Asvaghosha, in the first century of our  era; and this life is again founded on a legendary history, not framed  after any Indian model, but worked out among the nations in the north  of India.    The Life of Buddha by Asvaghosha is a poetical romance of nearly ten  thousand lines. It relates the miraculous conception of the Indian sage,  by the descent of a spirit on his mother, Maya,--a woman of great purity  of mind. The child was called Siddartha, or \"the perfection of all  things.\" His father ruled a considerable territory, and was careful to  conceal from the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#9)"],[1,"famine  of your house; but bring your youngest brother unto me, and ye shall not  die.\" There was apparently no alternative but to perish, or to bring  Benjamin into Egypt; and the sons of Jacob were compelled to accept the  condition.    Then their consciences were moved, and they saw a punishment for their  crime in selling Joseph fifteen years before. Even Reuben accused them,  and in the very presence of Joseph reminded them of their unnatural  cruelty, not supposing that he understood them, since Joseph had spoken  through an interpreter. This was too much for the stern governor; he  turned aside and wept, but speedily returned and took from them Simeon  and bound him before their eyes, and retained him for a surety. Then he  caused their sacks to be filled with corn, putting also their money  therein, and gave them in addition food for their return journey. But as  one of them on that journey opened his sack to give his ass provender,  he espied the money; and they were all filled with fear at this  unlooked-for incident. They made haste to reach their home and report  the strange intelligence to their father, including the demand for the  appearance of Benjamin, which filled him with the most violent grief.  \"Joseph is not,\" cried he, \"and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin  away!\" Reuben here expostulated with frantic eloquence. Jacob, however,  persisted: \"My son shall not go down with you; if mischief befall him,  ye will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to the grave.\"    Meanwhile the famine pressed, as Joseph knew full well it would, and  Jacob's family had eaten all their corn, and it became necessary to get  a new supply from Egypt. But Judah refused to go without Benjamin. \"The  man,\" said he, \"did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see  my face, except your brother be with you.\" Then Jacob upbraided Judah  for revealing the number and condition of his family; but Judah excused  himself on account of the searching cross-examination of the austere  governor which no one could resist, and persisted in the absolute  necessity of Benjamin's appearance in Egypt, unless they all should  yield to starvation. Moreover, he promised to be surety for his brother,  that no harm should come to him. Jacob at last saw the necessity of  allowing Benjamin to go, and reluctantly gave his consent; but in order  to appease the terrible man of Egypt he ordered his sons to take with  them a present of spices and balm and almonds, luxuries then in great  demand, and a double amount of money in their sacks to repay what they  had received. Then in pious resignation he said, \"If I am bereaved of my  children, I am bereaved,\" and hurried away his sons.    In due time they all safely arrived in Egypt, and with Benjamin stood  before Joseph, and made obeisance, and then excused themselves to  Joseph's steward, because of the money which had been returned in their  sacks. The steward encouraged them, and brought Simeon to them, and led  them into Joseph's house, where a feast was prepared by his orders.  With great difficulty Joseph restrained his feelings at the sight of  Benjamin, who was his own full brother, but asked kindly about the  father. At last his pent-up affections gave way, and he sought his  chamber and wept there in secret. He then sat down to the banquet with  his attendants at a separate table,--for the Egyptian would not eat with  foreigners,--still unrevealed to his brethren, but showed his partiality  to Benjamin by sending him a mess five times greater than to the rest.  They marvelled greatly that they were seated at the table according to  their seniority, and questioned among themselves how the austere  governor could know the ages of strangers.    Not yet did Joseph declare himself. His brothers were not yet  sufficiently humbled; a severe trial was still in store for them. As  before, he ordered his steward to fill the sacks as full as they could  carry, with every man's money in them, for he would not take his  father's money; and further ordered that his silver drinking-cup should  be put in Benjamin's sack. The brothers had scarcely left the city when  they were overtaken by the steward on a charge of theft, and upbraided  for stealing the silver cup. Of course they felt their innocence and  protested it; but it was of no avail, although they declared that if the  cup should be found in any one of their sacks, he in whose sack it  might be should die for the offence. The steward took them at their  word, proceeded to search the sacks, and lo! what was their surprise and  grief to see that the cup was found in Benjamin's sack! They rent their  clothes in utter despair, and returned to the city. Joseph received them  austerely, and declared that Benjamin should be retained in Egypt as his  servant, or slave. Then Judah, forgetting in whose presence he was, cast  aside all fear, and made the most eloquent and plaintive speech recorded  in the Bible, offering to remain in Benjamin's place as a slave, for how  could he face his father, who would surely die of grief at the loss of  his favorite child.    Joseph could refrain his feelings no longer. He made every attendant  leave his presence, and then declared himself to his brothers, whom God  had sent to Egypt to be the means of saving their lives. The brothers,  conscience stricken and ashamed, completely humbled and afraid, could  not answer his questions. Then Joseph tenderly, in their own language,  begged them to come near, and explained to them that it was not they who  sent him to Egypt, but God, to work out a great deliverance to their  posterity, and to be a father to Pharaoh himself, inasmuch as the famine  was to continue five years longer. \"Haste ye, and go up to my father,  and say unto him that God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down  unto me, and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen near unto me, thou  and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks and thy  herds, and all that thou hast, and there will I nourish thee. And ye  shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have  seen; and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.\" And he fell  on Benjamin's neck and wept, and kissed all his brothers. They then  talked with him without further reserve.    The news that Joseph's brethren had come to Egypt pleased Pharaoh, so  grateful was the King for the preservation of his kingdom. He could not  do enough for such a benefactor. \"Say to thy brethren, lade your beasts  and go, and take your father and your households, and come unto me; and  I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat  of the land.\" And the King commanded them to take his wagons to  transport their families and goods. Joseph also gave to each one of them  changes of raiment, and to Benjamin three hundred pieces of silver and  five changes of raiment, and ten asses laden with the good things of  Egypt for their father, and ten she-asses laden with corn. As they  departed, he archly said unto them, \"See that ye fall not out by  the way!\"    And when they arrived at Canaan, and told their father all that had  happened and all that they had seen, he fainted. The news was too good  to be true; he would not believe them. But when he saw the wagons his  spirit revived, and he said, \"It is enough. Joseph my son is yet alive.  I will go and see him before I die.\" The old man is again young in  spirit. He is for going immediately; he could leap,--yea, fly.    To Egypt, then, Israel with his sons and his cattle and all his wealth  hastened. His sons are astonished at the providence of God, so clearly  and impressively demonstrated on their behalf. The reconciliation of the  family is complete. All envy is buried in the unbounded prosperity of  Joseph. He is now too great for envy. He is to be venerated as the  instrument of God in saving his father's house and the land of Egypt.  They all now bow down to him, father and sons alike, and the only strife  now is who shall render him the most honor. He is the pride and glory of  his family, as he is of the land of Egypt, and of the household  of Pharaoh.    In the hospitality of the King, and his absence of jealousy of the  nomadic people whom he settled in the most fertile of his provinces, we  see additional confirmation of the fact that he was one of the Shepherd  Kings. The Pharaoh of Joseph's time seems to have affiliated with the  Israelites as natural friends,--to assist him in case of war. All the  souls that came into Egypt with Jacob were seventy in number, although  some historians think there was a much larger number. Rawlinson  estimates it at two thousand, and Dean Payne Smith at three thousand.    Jacob was one hundred and thirty years of age when he came to dwell in  the land of Goshen, and he lived seventeen years in Egypt. When he died,  Joseph was about fifty years old, and was still in power.    It was the dying wish of the old patriarch to be buried with his  fathers, and he made Joseph promise to carry his bones to the land of  Canaan and bury them in the sepulchre which Abraham had bought,--even  the cave of Machpelah.    Before Jacob died, Joseph brought his two sons to him to receive his  blessing,--Manasseh and Ephraim, born in Egypt, whose grandfather was  the high-priest of On, the city of the sun. As Manasseh was the oldest,  he placed him at the right hand of Jacob, but the old man wittingly and  designedly laid his right hand on Ephraim, which displeased Joseph. But  Jacob, without giving his reason, persisted. While he prophesied that  Manasseh should be great, Ephraim he said should be greater,--verified  in the fact that the tribe of Ephraim was the largest of all the tribes,  and the most powerful until the captivity. It was nearly as large as all  the rest together, although in the time of Moses the tribe of Manasseh  had become more numerous. We cannot penetrate the reason why Ephraim  the younger"]]]
