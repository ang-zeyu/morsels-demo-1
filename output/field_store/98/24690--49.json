They have spiders, you must  know, in this country, in infinite numbers, and of pretty large  dimensions, each of them being as big as one of the islands of the  Cyclades; these were ordered to cover the air from the moon quite to  the morning star; this being immediately done, and the field of  battle prepared, the infantry was drawn up under the command of  Nycterion, the son of Eudianax.    The left wing of the enemy, which was commanded by Phaeton himself,  consisted of the Hippomyrmices; these are large birds, and resemble  our ants, except with regard to size, the largest of them covering  two acres; these fight with their horns and were in number about  fifty thousand.  In the right wing were the Aeroconopes, {87a} about  five thousand, all archers, and riding upon large gnats.  To these  succeeded the Aerocoraces, {87b} light infantry, but remarkably  brave and useful warriors, for they threw out of slings exceeding  large radishes, which whoever was struck by, died immediately, a  most horrid stench exhaling from the wound; they are said, indeed,  to dip their arrows in a poisonous kind of mallow.  Behind these  stood ten thousand Caulomycetes, {88a} heavy-armed soldiers, who  fight hand to hand; so called because they use shields made of  mushrooms, and spears of the stalks of asparagus.  Near them were  placed the Cynobalani, {88b} about five thousand, who were sent by  the inhabitants of Sirius; these were men with dog's heads, and  mounted upon winged acorns:  some of their forces did not arrive in  time; amongst whom there were to have been some slingers from the  Milky-way, together with the Nephelocentauri; {88c} they indeed came  when the first battle was over, and I wish {88d} they had never come  at all:  the slingers did not appear, which, they say, so enraged  Phaeton that he set their city on fire.    Thus prepared, the enemy began the attack:  the signal being given,  and the asses braying on each side, for such are the trumpeters they  make use of on these occasions, the left wing of the Heliots, unable  to sustain the onset of our Hippogypi, soon gave way, and we pursued  them with great slaughter:  their right wing, however, overcame our  left.  The Aeroconopes falling upon us with astonishing force, and  advancing even to our infantry, by their assistance we recovered;  and they now began to retreat, when they found the left wing had  been beaten.  The defeat then becoming general, many of them were  taken prisoners and many slain; the blood flowed in such abundance  that the clouds were tinged with it and looked red, just as they  appear to us at sunset; from thence it distilled through upon the  earth.  Some such thing, I suppose, happened formerly amongst the  gods, which made Homer believe that Jove {89} rained blood at the  death of Sarpedon.    When we returned from our pursuit of the enemy we set up two  trophies; one, on account of the infantry engagement in the spider's  web, and another in the clouds, for our battle in the air.  Thus  prosperously everything went on, when our spies informed us that the  Nephelocentaurs, who should have been with Phaeton before the  battle, were just arrived:  they made, indeed, as they approached  towards us, a most formidable appearance, being half winged horses  and half men; the men from the waist upwards, about as big as the  Rhodian Colossus, and the horses of the size of a common ship of  burthen.  I have not mentioned the number of them, which was really  so great, that it would appear incredible:  they were commanded by  Sagittarius, {90a} from the Zodiac.  As soon as they learned that  their friends had been defeated they sent a message to Phaeton to  call him back, whilst they put their forces into order of battle,  and immediately fell upon the Selenites, {90b} who were unprepared  to resist them, being all employed in the division of the spoil;  they soon put them to flight, pursued the king quite to his own  city, and slew the greatest part of his birds; they then tore down  the trophies, ran over all the field woven by the spiders, and  seized me and two of my companions.  Phaeton at length coming up,  they raised other trophies for themselves; as for us, we were  carried that very day to the palace of the Sun, our hands bound  behind us by a cord of the spider's web.    The conquerors determined not to besiege the city of the Moon, but  when they returned home, resolved to build a wall between them and  the Sun, that his rays might not shine upon it; this wall was double  and made of thick clouds, so that the moon was always eclipsed, and  in perpetual darkness.  Endymion, sorely distressed at these  calamities, sent an embassy, humbly beseeching them to pull down the  wall, and not to leave him in utter darkness, promising to pay them  tribute, to assist them with his forces, and never more to rebel; he  sent hostages withal.  Phaeton called two councils on the affair, at  the first of which they were all inexorable, but at the second  changed their opinion; a treaty at length was agreed to on these  conditions:--    The Heliots {92} and their allies on one part, make the following  agreement with the Selenites and their allies on the other:--\"That  the Heliots shall demolish the wall now erected between them, that  they shall make no irruptions into the territories of the Moon; and  restore the prisoners according to certain articles of ransom to be  stipulated concerning them; that the Selenites shall permit all the  other stars to enjoy their rights and privileges; that they shall  never wage war with the Heliots, but assist them whenever they shall  be invaded; that the king of the Selenites shall pay to the king of  the Heliots an annual tribute of ten thousand casks of dew, for the  insurance of which, he shall send ten thousand hostages; that they  shall mutually send out a colony to the Morning-star, in which,  whoever of either nation shall think proper, may become a member;  that the treaty shall be inscribed on a column of amber, in the  midst of the air, and on the borders of the two kingdoms.  This  treaty was sworn to on the part of the Heliots, by Pyronides, {93}  and Therites, and Phlogius; and on the part of the Selenites, by  Nyctor, and Menarus, and Polylampus.\"    Such was the peace made between them; the wall was immediately  pulled down, and we were set at liberty.  When we returned to the  Moon, our companions met and embraced us, shedding tears of joy, as  did Endymion also.  He intreated us to remain there, or to go along  with the new colony; this I could by no means be persuaded to, but  begged he would let us down into the sea.  As he found I could not  be prevailed on to stay, after feasting us most nobly for seven  days, he dismissed us.    I will now tell you every thing which I met with in the Moon that  was new and extraordinary.  Amongst them, when a man grows old he  does not die, but dissolves into smoke and turns to air.  They all  eat the same food, which is frogs roasted on the ashes from a large  fire; of these they have plenty which fly about in the air, they get  together over the coals, snuff up the scent of them, and this serves  them for victuals.  Their drink is air squeezed into a cup, which  produces a kind of dew.    He who is quite bald is esteemed a beauty amongst them, for they  abominate long hair; whereas, in the comets, it is looked upon as a  perfection at least; so we heard from some strangers who were  speaking of them; they have, notwithstanding, small beards a little  above the knee; no nails to their feet, and only one great toe.  They have honey here which is extremely sharp, and when they  exercise themselves, wash their bodies with milk; this, mixed with a  little of their honey, makes excellent cheese. {94}  Their oil is  extracted from onions, is very rich, and smells like ointment.  Their wines, which are in great abundance, yield water, and the  grape stones are like hail; I imagine, indeed, that whenever the  wind shakes their vines and bursts the grape, then comes down  amongst us what we call hail.  They make use of their belly, which  they can open and shut as they please, as a kind of bag, or pouch,  to put anything in they want; it has no liver or intestines, but is  hairy and warm within, insomuch, that new-born children, when they  are cold, frequently creep into it.  The garments of the rich  amongst them are made of glass, but very soft:  the poor have woven  brass, which they have here in great abundance, and by pouring a  little water over it, so manage as to card it like wool.  I am  afraid to mention their eyes, lest, from the incredibility of the  thing, you should not believe me.  I must, however, inform you that  they have eyes which they take in and out whenever they please:  so  that they can preserve them anywhere till occasion serves, and then  make use of them; many who have lost their own, borrow from others;  and there are several rich men who keep a stock of eyes by them.  Their ears are made of the leaves of plane-trees, except of those  who spring, as I observed to you, from acorns, these alone have  wooden ones.  I saw likewise another very extraordinary thing in the  king's palace, which was a looking-glass that is placed in a well  not very deep; whoever goes down into the well hears everything that  is said upon earth, and if he looks into the glass, beholds all the  cities and nations of the world as plain as if he was close to them.  I myself saw several of my friends there, and my whole native  country; whether they saw me also I will not pretend to affirm.  He  who does not believe these things, whenever he goes there will know  that I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#9)"],[1," the Constitution on     Congress can be delegated and then only for war purposes. As a state     of war would not exist at the time action was required, I do not     believe that it could be done, and any provision contracting to take     measures of this nature would be contrary to the Constitution and as     a consequence void.       \"But, assuming that Congress possessed the power of delegation, I am     convinced that it would not only refuse to do so, but would resent     such a suggestion because of the fact that both Houses have been and     are extremely jealous of their rights and authority.       \"Viewed from the standpoints of legality and expediency it would seem     necessary to find some other method than coercion in enforcing an     international guaranty, or else to find some substitute for a     guaranty which would be valueless without affirmative action to     support it.       \"I believe that such a substitute can be found.\"    The foregoing memorandum was intended as an introduction to the negative  guaranty or \"self-denying covenant\" which I desired to lay before the  President as a substitute for the one upon which he intended to build  the League of Nations. The memorandum was suggestive merely, but in view  of the necessity for a speedy decision there was no time to prepare an  exhaustive legal opinion. Furthermore, I felt that the President, whose  hours were at that time crowded with numerous personal conferences and  public functions, would find little opportunity to peruse a long and  closely reasoned argument on the subject.    The most important portion of the document was that entitled \"_Suggested  Draft of Articles for Discussion_. December 20, 1918.\" It reads  as follows:       \"The parties to this convention, for the purpose of maintaining     international peace and preventing future wars between one another,     hereby constitute themselves into a League of Nations and solemnly     undertake jointly and severally to fulfill the obligations imposed     upon them in the following articles:       \"A       \"Each power signatory or adherent hereto severally covenants and     guarantees that it will not violate the territorial integrity or     impair the political independence of any other power signatory or     adherent to this convention except when authorized so to do by a     decree of the arbitral tribunal hereinafter referred to or by a     three-fourths vote of the International Council of the League of     Nations created by this convention.       \"B       \"In the event that any power signatory or adherent hereto shall fail     to observe the covenant and guaranty set forth in the preceding     article, such breach of covenant and guaranty shall _ipso facto_     operate as an abrogation of this convention in so far as it applies     to the offending power and furthermore as an abrogation of all     treaties, conventions, and agreements heretofore or hereafter entered     into between the offending power and all other powers signatory and     adherent to this convention.       \"C       \"A breach of the covenant and guaranty declared in Article A shall     constitute an act unfriendly to all other powers signatory and     adherent hereto, and they shall forthwith sever all diplomatic,     consular, and official relations with the offending power, and shall,     through the International Council, hereinafter provided for, exchange     views as to the measures necessary to restore the power, whose     sovereignty has been invaded, to the rights and liberties which it     possessed prior to such invasion and to prevent further     violation thereof.       \"D       \"Any interference with a vessel on the high seas or with aircraft     proceeding over the high seas, which interference is not     affirmatively sanctioned by the law of nations shall be, for the     purposes of this convention, considered an impairment of political     independence.\"    In considering the foregoing series of articles constituting a guaranty  against one's own acts, instead of a guaranty against the acts of  another, it must be remembered that, at the time of their preparation, I  had not seen a draft of the President's proposed guaranty, though from  conversations with Colonel House and from my study of Point XIV of \"The  Fourteen Points,\" I knew that it was affirmative rather than negative in  form and would require positive action to be effective in the event that  the menace of superior force was insufficient to prevent  aggressive acts.    As far as I am able to judge from subsequently acquired knowledge,  President Wilson at the time he received my letter of December 23 had a  typewritten draft of the document which after certain amendments he  later laid before the American Commissioners and which he had printed  with a few verbal changes under the title of \"The Covenant.\" In order to  understand the two forms of guaranty which he had for consideration  after he received my letter, I quote the article relating to it, which  appears in the first printed draft of the Covenant.       III       \"The Contracting Powers unite in guaranteeing to each other political     independence and territorial integrity; but it is understood between     them that such territorial readjustments, if any, as may in the     future become necessary by reasons of changes in present racial     conditions and aspirations or present social and political     relationships, pursuant to the principle of self-determination, and     also such territorial readjustments as may in the judgment of three     fourths of the Delegates be demanded by the welfare and manifest     interest of the people concerned, may be effected if agreeable to     those peoples; and that territorial changes may involve material     compensation. The Contracting Powers accept without reservation the     principle that the peace of the world is superior in importance to     every question of political jurisdiction or boundary.\"    It seems needless to comment upon the involved language and the  uncertainty of meaning of this article wherein it provided for  \"territorial readjustments\" of which there appeared to be two classes,  one dependent on \"self-determination,\" the other on the judgment of the  Body of Delegates of the League. In view of the possible reasons which  might be advanced for changes in territory and allegiance, justification  for an appeal to the guarantors was by no means certain. If this article  had been before me when the letter of December 23 was written, I might  have gone much further in opposition to the President's plan for  stabilizing peace in the world on the ground that a guaranty so  conditioned would cause rather than prevent international discord.    Though without knowledge of the exact terms of the President's proposed  guaranty, I did not feel for the reason stated that I could delay longer  in submitting my views to the President. There was not time to work out  a complete and well-digested plan for a League, but I had prepared in  the rough several articles for discussion which related to the  organization, and which might be incorporated in the organic agreement  which I then assumed would be a separate document from the treaty  restoring peace. While unwilling to lay these articles before the  President until they were more carefully drafted, I enclosed in my  letter the following as indicative of the character of the organization  which it seemed to me would form a simple and practical agency common to  all nations:       \"_Suggestions as to an International Council For Discussion_       \"_December_ 21, 1918       \"An International Council of the League of Nations is hereby     constituted, which shall be the channel for communication between the     members of the League, and the agent for common action.       \"The International Council shall consist of the diplomatic     representative of each party signatory or adherent to this     convention at ----.       \"Meetings of the International Council shall be held at ----, or in     the event that the subject to be considered involves the interests of     ---- or its nationals, then at such other place outside the territory     of a power whose interests are involved as the Supervisory Committee     of the Council shall designate.       \"The officer charged with the conduct of the foreign affairs of the     power where a meeting is held shall be the presiding officer thereof.       \"At the first meeting of the International Council a Supervisory     Committee shall be chosen by a majority vote of the members present,     which shall consist of five members and shall remain in office for     two years or until their successors are elected.       \"The Supervisory Committee shall name a Secretariat which shall have     charge of the archives of the Council and receive all communications     addressed to the Council or Committee and send all communications     issued by the Council or Committee.       \"The Supervisory Committee may draft such rules of procedure as it     deems necessary for conducting business coming before the Council or     before the Committee.       \"The Supervisory Committee may call a meeting of the Council at its     discretion and must call a meeting at the request of any member of     the Council provided the request contains a written statement of the     subject to be discussed.       \"The archives of the Council shall be open at any time to any member     of the Council, who may make and retain copies thereof.       \"All expenses of the Supervisory Committee and Secretariat shall be     borne equally by all powers signatory or adherent to this     convention.\"    As indicated by the caption, this document was intended merely \"for  discussion\" of the principal features of the organization. It should be  noted that the basic principle is the equality of nations. No special  privileges are granted to the major powers in the conduct of the  "]]]
