In our own time the value  of such institutions has been widely recognized, and the success of  those at Hampton and Tuskegee has stimulated anew the interest in  industrial education as one important factor in the elevation of the  colored race.    In the years from 1853 to 1860 the slave power, inspired with divine  madness, rushed headlong toward its doom. The arbitrary enforcement of  the Fugitive Slave Act; the struggle between freedom and slavery in  Kansas; the Dred Scott decision, by which a learned and subtle judge,  who had it within his power to enlarge the boundaries of human liberty  and cover his own name with glory, deliberately and laboriously  summarized and dignified with the sanction of a court of last resort  all the most odious prejudices that had restricted the opportunities  of the colored people; the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; the John  Brown raid; the [1855] assault on [Massachusetts antislavery U.S.  Senator] Charles Sumner,--each of these incidents has been, in itself,  the subject of more than one volume. Of these events the Dred Scott  decision was the most disheartening. Douglass was not proof against  the universal gloom, and began to feel that there was little hope of  the peaceful solution of the question of slavery. It was in one of his  darker moments that old Sojourner Truth, whose face appeared in so  many anti-slavery gatherings, put her famous question, which breathed  a sublime and childlike faith in God, even when his hand seemed  heaviest on her people: \"Frederick,\" she asked, \"is God dead?\" The  orator paused impressively, and then thundered in a voice that  thrilled his audience with prophetic intimations, \"No, God is not  dead; and therefore it is that slavery must end in blood!\"    During this period John Brown stamped his name indelibly upon American  history. It was almost inevitable that a man of the views, activities,  and prominence of Douglass should become acquainted with John Brown.  Their first meeting, however, was in 1847, more than ten years before  the tragic episode at Harpers Ferry. At that time Brown was a merchant  at Springfield, Massachusetts, whither Douglass was invited to visit  him. In his _Life and Times_ he describes Brown as a prosperous  merchant, who in his home lived with the utmost abstemiousness, in  order that he might save money for the great scheme he was already  revolving. \"His wife believed in him, and his children observed him  with reverence. His arguments seemed to convince all, his appeals  touched all, and his will impressed all. Certainly, I never felt  myself in the presence of stronger religious influence than while in  this man's house.\" There in his own home, where Douglass stayed as his  guest, Brown outlined a plan which in substantially the same form he  held dear to his heart for a decade longer. This plan, briefly stated,  was to establish camps at certain easily defended points in the  Allegheny Mountains; to send emissaries down to the plantations in  the lowlands, starting in Virginia, and draw off the slaves to these  mountain fastnesses; to maintain bands of them there, if possible, as  a constant menace to slavery and an example of freedom; or, if that  were impracticable, to lead them to Canada from time to time by the  most available routes. Wild as this plan may seem in the light of the  desperate game subsequently played by slavery, it did not at the time  seem impracticable to such level-headed men as Theodore Parker and  Thomas Wentworth Higginson.    Douglass's views were very much colored by his association with  Brown; but, with his usual prudence and foresight, he pointed out the  difficulties of this plan. From the time of their first meeting the  relations of the two men were friendly and confidential. Captain Brown  had his scheme ever in mind, and succeeded in convincing Douglass and  others that it would subserve a useful purpose,--that, even if it  resulted in failure, it would stir the conscience of the nation to a  juster appreciation of the iniquity of slavery.    The Kansas troubles, however, turned Brown's energies for a time into  a different channel. After Kansas had been secured to freedom, he  returned with renewed ardor to his old project. He stayed for three  weeks at Douglass's house at Rochester, and while there carried on  an extensive correspondence with sympathizers and supporters, and  thoroughly demonstrated to all with whom he conversed that he was a  man of one all-absorbing idea.    In 1859, very shortly before the raid at Harpers Ferry, Douglass met  Brown by appointment, in an abandoned stone quarry near Chambersburg,  Pennsylvania. John Brown was already an outlaw, with a price upon his  head; for a traitor had betrayed his plan the year before, and he had  for this reason deferred its execution for a year. The meeting was  surrounded by all the mystery and conducted with all the precautions  befitting a meeting of conspirators. Brown had changed the details  of his former plan, and told Douglass of his determination to take  Harpers Ferry. Douglass opposed the measure vehemently, pointing out  its certain and disastrous failure. Brown met each argument with  another, and was not to be swayed from his purpose. They spent more  than a day together discussing the details of the movement. When the  more practical Douglass declined to take part in Brown's attempt, the  old man threw his arms around his swarthy friend, in a manner typical  of his friendship for the dark race, and said: \"Come with me,  Douglass, I will defend you with my life. I want you for a special  purpose. When I strike, the bees will begin to swarm, and I shall  want you to help hive them.\" But Douglass would not be persuaded. His  abandonment of his old friend on the eve of a desperate enterprise was  criticised by some, who, as Douglass says, \"kept even farther from  this brave and heroic man than I did.\" John Brown went forth to meet  a felon's fate and wear a martyr's crown: Douglass lived to fight the  battles of his race for years to come. There was room for both, and  each played the part for which he was best adapted. It would have  strengthened the cause of liberty very little for Douglass to die with  Brown.    It is quite likely, however, that he narrowly escaped Brown's fate.  When the raid at Harpers Ferry had roused the country, Douglass, with  other leading Northern men, was indicted in Virginia for complicity in  the affair. Brown's correspondence had fallen into the hands of  the Virginia authorities, and certain letters seemed to implicate  Douglass. A trial in Virginia meant almost certain death. Governor  Wise, of Virginia, would have hung him with cheerful alacrity, and  publicly expressed his desire to do so. Douglass, with timely warning  that extradition papers had been issued for his arrest, escaped to  Canada. He had previously planned a second visit to England, and the  John Brown affair had delayed his departure by some days. He sailed  from Quebec, November 12, 1859.    After a most uncomfortable winter voyage of fourteen days Douglass  found himself again in England, an object of marked interest and in  very great demand as a speaker. Six months he spent on the hospitable  shores of Great Britain, lecturing on John Brown, on slavery and other  subjects, and renewing the friendships of former years. Being informed  of the death of his youngest daughter, he cut short his visit, which  he had meant to extend to France, and returned to the United States.  So rapid had been the course of events since his departure that the  excitement over the John Brown raid had subsided. The first Lincoln  campaign was in active progress; and the whole country quivered with  vague anticipation of the impending crisis which was to end the  conflict of irreconcilable principles, and sweep slavery out of the  path of civilization and progress. Douglass plunged into the campaign  with his accustomed zeal, and did what he could to promote the triumph  of the Republican party. Lincoln was elected, and in a few short  months the country found itself in the midst of war. God was not dead,  and slavery was to end in blood.          IX.      Ever mindful of his people and seeking always to promote their  welfare, Douglass was one of those who urged, in all his addresses at  this period, the abolition of slavery and the arming of the negroes  as the most effective means of crushing the rebellion. In 1862 he  delivered a series of lectures in New England under the auspices of  the recently formed Emancipation League, which contended for abolition  as a military necessity.    The first or conditional emancipation proclamation was issued in  September, 1862; and shortly afterward Douglass published a pamphlet  for circulation in Great Britain, entitled _The Slave's Appeal to  Great Britain_, in which he urged the English people to refuse  recognition of the independence of the Confederate States. He always  endeavored in his public utterances to remove the doubts and fears of  those who were tempted to leave the negroes in slavery because of the  difficulty of disposing of them after they became free. Douglass, with  the simple, direct, primitive sense of justice that had always marked  his mind, took the only true ground for the solution of the race  problems of that or any other epoch,-that the situation should be met  with equal and exact justice, and that his people should be allowed to  do as they pleased with themselves, \"subject only to the same great  laws which apply to other men.\" He was a conspicuous figure at the  meeting in Tremont Temple, Boston, on January 1, 1863, when the  Emancipation Proclamation, hourly expected by an anxious gathering,  finally flashed over the wires. Douglass was among the first to  suggest the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11015"],[0,"Pantheism, Its Story and Significance (#9)"],[1,"impulse to do right. But should it be asked what if the  resultant impulse of the whole nature is toward wrong? the answer is, in  that case there is no freedom, but a slavery to some external influence  or to a disturbed balance of the passions. Or if it be asked what is  right? that is a far reaching question to the solution of which Spinoza  bends all his splendid powers. But limits of space preclude me from  saying more than, that his ideal of right will be found conformable to  the highest standards of the most spiritual religions.    [Sidenote: Purity.]    This ideal I ventured to symbolize rather than define as \"purity.\" For  after all the philosophic reasoning with which it is no less lucidly  than laboriously worked out in the final book of his _Ethica_,  \"Concerning Human. Freedom\"--the moral result of all this intellectual  effort is that same cleansing of the soul from vain desire and that  subordination of the earthly self to its divine idea which we are taught  in the Sermon on the Mount. And while surely every one but a fanatical  anti-Christian must allow the greater prophetic worth of the Galilean,  who could teach these sublime lessons so that \"the common people heard  him gladly,\" it seems difficult to deny to the heretic Jew of the Hague  the second rank among the teachers given to the world by that strangely  gifted race. For though he could not speak to \"the common people,\" he  left as his legacy to mankind, not so much a system of philosophy, as an  impregnable foundation for morals and religion, available for the time  now coming upon us--such a time as that suggested by the writer of the  Epistle to the Hebrews, when he spoke of \"the removing of those things  that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which  cannot be shaken may remain.\" No doubt Sir Frederic Pollock is quite  right in declaring that Spinoza would have been the very last man to  desire any one to become a Spinozist. But that is quite consistent with  the inspired Pantheist's infinite longing to see all men blessed by that  inward peace which he proved, by his own heroic experience, to be  identical with the self-control conferred and maintained by devout  contemplation of God's all-comprehensive Being and our place therein.  If, then, I regard purity as the best symbol of such a moral ideal, it  is because the word connotes, together with freedom from discordant  passion, a frankly unconstrained recognition of the simplicity of our  relation to God. For surely when once the self has made the great  surrender, and becomes content to be nothing, that in St. Paul's words,  \"God may be all in all,\" the whole problem of life is infinitely  simplified, in the sense that no farther degree of simplification is  possible. Because all contradictions of pain and evil and sorrow are  dissolved in that act of surrender. We must, indeed, recognize that to  our \"inadequate ideas\" the time often seems \"out of joint.\" But we need  not, with Hamlet, cry out on an impossible \"spite.\" For when once it is  heartily and loyally realized that not our partial likings, but the  eternal harmony of the Whole, is the glory of God, we already anticipate  the peace of absorption in the Infinite.    [Sidenote: Love.]    Nor is this moral ideal without a sacred passion; at least to ordinary  men; though it must be confessed that Spinoza, in the stillness of his  sacred peace, ignored the word. But he still held that the larger our  view of the Universe and of our communion therewith, the more we have of  God in us and the more do we realize an \"intellectual love\" towards Him.  That this in his case was no barren sentiment, but a genuine moral  inspiration, was proved by his life; for truly \"he endured as seeing Him  who is invisible.\" And it was not by faculties wholly wanting to smaller  men that he did this. For though his intellect was in some respects  almost beyond compare, it was rather by his self-subordinating  contemplation that he was kept at peace. Indeed, he knew far less of the  extended universe than our men of science do, and his doctrines of mind  and thought are, by indisputable authorities, regarded as imperfect. But  imagining what God must be, could we have an adequate idea not only of  His Being--which Spinoza thought he had--but of His infinite attributes  and their modes--which Spinoza recognized that he had not--he declared  that love toward God was the very highest good. And it was supremely  blessed in this, that it could engender no jealousy nor selfishness, nor  sectarian zeal, but rather a large-hearted charity which would gather  all mankind into the present heaven of that love.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 15: It is not within the scope of the present essay to give a  life of Barach (or Benedict) de Spinoza. But for the sake of those to  whom the work of Sir Frederick Pollock is not easily accessible, the  following particulars may be given. Spinoza was born in Amsterdam,  November, 1632, of a fairly prosperous Jewish family, originally from  Portugal. He received thorough instruction in the language and  literature of the Hebrews, and in addition became a good Latin scholar,  so far as to write and correspond in that language. He was early  interested in philosophy, and especially attracted for a time by the  writings of Descartes. By the time he was twenty-three years old he was  suspected of heresy, and in his twenty-fourth year (1655) was cut off  from the Synagogue with a frightful curse. His family disowned him, and  for his maintenance he turned to the polishing of lenses, a trade  already learned in accordance with the Jewish custom that every boy must  have a handicraft. What he earned would hardly be considered a \"living  wage\" in these days. But according to Colerus, his first biographer, who  enquired of the householders with whom Spinoza lodged, his day's  maintenance of often cost no more than 4-1/2_d_. Various incidents  proved his total indifference to money, except as far as needed to  \"provide things honest in the sight of all men.\" Though of an amiable  and sociable disposition he lived a solitary life, while not indisposed  to kindly talk with his humbler neighbours. He had some of the greatest  scholars of the day among his correspondents. He published but little  during his life, leaving his greatest work as a legacy to the world on  his early death, at the Hague, from consumption, in 1677.]    [Footnote 16: \"It is to be observed that, inasmuch as Attribute is  defined by reference to intellect, and Thought itself is an attribute,  Thought appears to be in a manner, counted twice over.\"--_Spinoza: His  Life and Philosophy_, by Sir Frederick Pollock. Second edition, 1899, p.  153.]    [Footnote 17: It is of course true that Spinoza considered himself to  have a clear and adequate conception of God. But by this he meant only  that, as a philosopher, he had an intuitive certainty of eternal and  infinite Being. So have all of us humbler mortals, though we should not  have been able to express it for ourselves. No one supposes that for an  indefinite space of time or eternity there was nothing, and then  suddenly there was something. But, if not, then everyone recognises with  Spinoza the fact of eternal Being, though, of course, he saw what this  recognition meant, as the many do not. But when it comes to the facts of  mortal imperfections and ignorance, Spinoza, with his theory of  \"inadequate ideas,\" is as ready as Spencer to acknowledge the  Unknowable.]    [Footnote 18: I do not think it necessary in an essay of this kind to  discuss Spinoza's theory of the body as object of the mind, and the mind  as \"idea\" of the body, both being different aspects of the same thing.]    [Footnote 19: \"Rei alicujus singularis actu existentis.\" The word  \"divine\" does not occur in Prop. xi. Ethices II., from which I quote.  But it is implied; because the mind is only a mode or modification of  the infinite attribute of thought, which again expresses the eternal  Substance in God. I venture a doubt whether \"actually existing,\" though  adopted by such authorities as Sir F. Pollock gives, with any  distinctness, Spinoza's meaning. I may be wrong, but I suspect that one  of the later uses of \"actus,\" as quoted in Ducange, affected Spinoza's  Latinity. Thus several ecclesiastical writers are quoted as using the  word in the sense of office, or function. Surely this would suit  Spinoza's definition of the mind. For he treats it as a centre of  phenomenal activity amidst the infinite modes of the divine attribute.  Its apparent individuality is a consequence of its spontaneity as a  centre of action--always understood that the spontaneity is consistent  with the absolute eternal order assumed throughout the work.]    [Footnote 20: Of course the professor of optics can tell us how many  vibrations in a second go to produce the particular shade of colour. But  these cannot by any means be identified with conscious perception; and  it is with this only that we are concerned.]    [Footnote 21: Ethices Pars II., Prop. xi. Corollarium. \"Hence it follows  that the human mind is part of the infinite intellect (thought) of God;  and accordingly, when we say that the human mind perceives this or that,  we only say that God--not in His infinity, but so far as He is expressed  by the nature of the human mind, or, so far as He constitutes the  essence of the human mind--has this or that idea. And when, we say that  God has this or that idea, not only so far as He constitutes the nature  of the human mind, but so far as He has the idea also of some other  thing together with the human mind, then we say that the human mind  perceives the thing in part, or inadequately.\" E.G. all races have  naturally supposed earthquakes and storm, battle, murder and sudden  death to present ideas identical in the minds of their gods and of  themselves.
