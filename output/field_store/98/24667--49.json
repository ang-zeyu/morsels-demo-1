Maria Louisa lived within her income, or if she desired  any indulgence beyond it, which was rarely the case, she asked it as a  favour of Napoleon. Josephine, accustomed to political intrigue, loved  to manage, to influence, and to guide her husband; Maria Louisa desired  only to please and to obey him. Both were excellent women, of great  sweetness of temper, and fondly attached to Napoleon. In the difference  between these distinguished persons, we can easily discriminate the  leading features of the Parisian, and of the simple German beauty; but  it is certainly singular that the artificial character should have  belonged to the daughter of the West Indian planter; that marked by  nature and simplicity, to a princess of the proudest court in Europe.    Bonaparte, whose domestic conduct was generally praiseworthy, behaved  with the utmost kindness to his princely bride. He observed, however,  the strictest etiquette, and required it from the empress. If it  happened, for example, as was often the case, that he was prevented from  attending at the hour when dinner was placed on the table, he was  displeased if, in the interim of his absence, which was often prolonged,  she either took a book, or had recourse to any female occupation,--if,  in short, he did not find her in the attitude of waiting for the signal  to take her place at table. Perhaps a sense of his inferior birth made  Napoleon more tenacious of this species of form, as what he could not  afford to relinquish. On the other hand, Maria Louisa is said to have  expressed her surprise at her husband's dispensing with the use of arms  and attendance of guards, and at his moving about with the freedom of  an individual; although this could be no great novelty to a member of  the imperial family of Austria, most of whom, and especially the Emperor  Francis, are in the habit of mixing familiarly with the people of  Vienna, at public places, and in the public walks.    From this date may be traced the declination of Napoleon's greatness. In  the field he was generally unsuccessful, and occasionally murmurs of  discontent were whispered by citizen and soldier. The plot thickens in  the eight volume, and his abdication of the throne of France, and  subsequent journey to Elba, are feelingly narrated by our author.      RETURN OF MARIA LOUISA TO HER FATHER, AND DEATH OF JOSEPHINE.    Maria Louisa made more than one effort to join her husband, but they  were discouraged on the part of Napoleon himself, who, while he  continued to ruminate on renewing the war, could not desire to have the  empress along with him in such an adventure. Shortly afterwards, the  emperor of Austria visited his daughter and her son, then at  Rambouillet, and gave her to understand that she was, for some time at  least, to remain separate from her husband, and that her son and she  were to return to Vienna along with him. She returned, therefore, to her  father's protection.    It must be also here mentioned, as an extraordinary addition to this  tale of calamity, that Josephine, the former wife of Bonaparte, did not  long survive his downfall. It seemed as if the Obi-woman of Martinico  had spoke truth; for at the time when Napoleon parted from the sharer of  his early fortunes, his grandeur was on the wane, and her death took  place but a few weeks subsequent to his being dethroned and exiled. The  emperor of Russia had visited this lady, and showed her some attention,  with which Napoleon, for reasons we cannot conjecture, was extremely  displeased. She was amply provided for by the treaty of Fontainbleau,  but did not survive to reap any benefit from the provision, as she  shortly after sickened and died at her beautiful villa of Malmaison. She  was buried on the 3rd of June, at the village of Ruel. A vast number of  the lower class attended the obsequies; for she had well deserved the  title of patroness of the poor.    The residence at Elba, the return, the treachery of Ney, the arrival at  Paris, and Napoleon's repossession of the throne, now occupy the page.  The battle of Waterloo is briefly, but finely described, and indeed the  whole of the ninth volume, to which we have now arrived, is deeply  interesting. We find, however, that we have nearly reached our limits,  and as we shall take an early opportunity of again referring to this  elaborate history, we shall now close with the following extracts;--      CONDUCT OF NAPOLEON ON HIS WAY TO ST. HELENA.    Upon the Northumberland crossing the line, the emperor desiring to  exhibit his munificence to the seamen, by presenting them with a hundred  louis d'or, under pretext of paying the ordinary fine, Sir George  Cockburn, considering this tribute to Neptune as too excessive in  amount, would not permit the donative to exceed a tenth part of the sum;  and Napoleon offended by the restriction, paid nothing at all. Upon  another occasion, early in the voyage, a difference in national manners  gave rise to one of those slight misunderstandings which we have  noticed. Napoleon was accustomed, like all Frenchmen, to leave the table  immediately after dinner, and Sir George Cockburn, with the English  officers, remained after him at table; for, in permitting his French  guests their liberty, the admiral did not choose to admit the right of  Napoleon to break up the party at his, Sir George's, own table. This  gave some discontent. Notwithstanding these trifling subjects of  dissatisfaction, Las Cases informs us that the admiral, whom he took to  be prepossessed against them at first, became every day more amicable.  The emperor used to take his arm every evening on the quarter-deck, and  hold long conversations with him upon maritime subjects, as well as past  events in general.    While on board the Northumberland, the late emperor spent his mornings  in reading or writing; his evenings in his exercise upon deck, and at  cards. The game was generally _vingt un_. But when the play became  rather deep, he discouraged that amusement, and substituted chess. Great  tactician as he was, Napoleon did not play well at that military game,  and it was with difficulty that his antagonist, Montholon, could avoid  the solecism, of beating the emperor.    During this voyage, Napoleon's _jour de fete_ occurred, which was also  his birthday. It was the 15th of August; a day for which the Pope had  expressly canonized a St. Napoleon to be the emperor's patron. And now,  strange revolution, it was celebrated by him on board of an English  man-of-war, which was conducting him to his place of imprisonment, and,  as it proved, his tomb. Yet Napoleon seemed cheerful and contented  during the whole day, and was even pleased at being fortunate at play,  which he received as a good omen.    Upon the 15th of October, 1815, the Northumberland reached St. Helena,  which presents but an unpromising aspect to those who design it for a  residence, though it may be a welcome sight to the seaworn mariner. Its  destined inhabitant, from the deck of the Northumberland, surveyed it  with his spy-glass. St. James' Town, an inconsiderable village, was  before him, enchased, as it were in a valley, amid arid and scarped  rocks of immense height; every platform, every opening, every gorge, was  bristled with cannon. Las Cases, who stood by him, could not perceive  the slightest alteration of his countenance. The orders of government  had been, that Napoleon should remain on board till a residence could be  prepared suitable for the line of life he was to lead in future. But as  this was likely to be a work of time, Sir George Cockburn readily  undertook, on his own responsibility, to put his passengers on shore,  and provide in some way for the security of Napoleon's person, until the  necessary habitation should be fitted up. He was accordingly transferred  to land upon the 16th of October; and thus the emperor of France, nay,  wellnigh of Europe, sunk into the recluse of St. Helena.      DEATH OF NAPOLEON    During the 3rd of May, it was seen that the life of Napoleon was drawing  evidently to a close; and his followers, and particularly his physician,  became desirous to call in more medical assistance;--that of Dr. Shortt,  physician to the forces, and of Dr. Mitchell, surgeon of the flag-ship,  was referred to. Dr. Shortt, however, thought it proper to assert the  dignity belonging to his profession, and refused to give an opinion on a  case of so much importance in itself, and attended with so much  obscurity, unless he were permitted to see and examine the patient. The  officers of Napoleon's household excused themselves, by professing that  the emperor's strict commands had been laid on them, that no English  physician, Dr. Arnott excepted, should approach his dying bed. They  said, that even when he was speechless they would be unable to brook his  eye, should he turn it upon them in reproof for their disobedience.    About two o'clock of the same day, the priest Vignali administered the  sacrament of extreme unction. Some days before, Napoleon had explained  to him the manner in which he desired his body should be laid out in  state, in an apartment lighted by torches, or what Catholics call _une  chambre ardente_. \"I am neither,\" he said in the same phrase which we  have formerly quoted, \"a philosopher nor a physician. I believe in God,  and am of the religion of my father. It is not everybody who can be an  atheist. I was born a Catholic, and will fulfil all the duties of the  Catholic church, and receive the assistance which it administers.\" He  then turned to Dr. Antommarchi, whom he seems to have suspected of  heterodoxy, which the doctor, however, disowned. \"How can you carry it  so far?\" he said. \"Can you not believe in God, whose existence every  thing proclaims, and in whom the greatest minds have believed?\"    As if to mark a closing point of resemblance betwixt Cromwell and  Napoleon, a dreadful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#8)"],[1,", \"for Aristotle    says, 'He who says, I do not know, has already attained the half of    knowledge.'\"    But he says he knows medicine; so Joseph proceeds to question him. Soon he  discovers that Enan is again deceiving him; and he abuses Enan roundly for  his duplicity.    Enan at length is moved to retort.      \"I wonder at thy learning,\" says Enan, \"but more at thy appetite.\" Then    the lamp goes out, the servant falls asleep, and they are left in    darkness till the morning. Then Joseph demands his breakfast, and goes    out to see his ass. The ass attempts to bite Joseph, who strikes it, and    the ass speaks. \"I am one of the family of Balaam's ass,\" says the    animal. \"But I am not Balaam,\" says Joseph, \"to divine that thou hast    eaten nothing all night.\" The servant asserts that he fed the ass, but    the animal had gobbled up everything, his appetite being equal to his    owner's. But Joseph will not believe this, and Enan is deeply hurt.    \"Peace!\" he shouts, and his eyes shoot flames, and his nostrils distil    smoke. \"Peace, cease thy folly, or, as I live, and my ancestor Asmodeus,    I will seize thee with my little finger, and will show thee the city of    David.\"      In timid tones Joseph asks him, \"Who is this Asmodeus, thy kinsman?\"      ENAN REVEALS HIMSELF      \"Asmodeus,\" said Enan, \"the great prince who, on his wing, bore Solomon    from his kingdom to a distant strand.\" \"Woe is me,\" I moaned, \"I thought    thee a friend; now thou art a fiend. Why didst thou hide thy nature? Why    didst thou conceal thy descent? Why hast thou taken me from my home in    guile?\" \"Nay,\" said Enan, \"where was thy understanding? I gave thee my    name, thou shouldst have inverted it\" [i.e., transpose _Desh_ to _Shed_.    Enan at the beginning of the tale had announced himself as _ha-Desh_, he    now explains that meant _ha-Shed_ = the demon]. Then Enan gives his    pedigree: \"I am Enan, the Satan, son of Arnan the Demon, son of the Place    of Death, son of Rage, son of Death's Shadow, son of Terror, son of    Trembling, son of Destruction, son of Extinction, son of Evil-name, son    of Mocking, son of Plague, son of Deceit, son of Injury, son of    Asmodeus.\"    Nevertheless Enan quiets Joseph's fears, and promises that no harm shall  befall him. He goes through Enan's city, sees wizards and sorcerers, and  sinners and fools, all giants.      ENAN'S FRIEND AND HIS DAUGHTER      Then Enan introduces his own especial friend. \"He is good and wise,\" said    Enan, \"despite his tall stature. He shows his goodness in hating the wise    and loving fools; he is generous, for he will give a beggar a crust of    dry bread, and make him pay for it; he knows medicine, for he can tell    that if a man is buried, he either has been sick, or has had an accident;    he knows astronomy, for he can tell that it is day when the sun shines,    and night when the stars appear; he knows arithmetic, for he can tell    that one and one make two; he knows mensuration, for he can tell how many    handbreadths his belly measures; he knows music, for he can tell the    difference between the barking of a dog and the braying of an ass.\" \"But,    said I,\" continues Joseph, \"how canst thou be the friend of such a one?    Accursed is he, accursed his master.\" \"Nay,\" answered Enan, \"I love him    not; I know his vile nature: 'tis his daughter that binds me to him, for    she, with her raven locks and dove's eyes and lily cheeks, is fair beyond    my power to praise.\" Yet I warned him against marrying the daughter of an    uneducated man, an Am ha-Arez. Then follows a compilation of passages    directed against ignorance. \"Ah!\" cries Enan, \"your warning moves me. My    love for her is fled. Thou fearest God and lovest me, my friend. What is    a friend? One heart in two bodies. Then find me another wife, one who is    beautiful and good. Worse than a plague is a bad woman. Listen to what    once befell me with such a one.\"    Thereupon Enan introduces the last of the stories incorporated into the  book:      THE WASHERWOMAN WHO DID THE DEVIL'S WORK      Once upon a time, in my wanderings to and fro upon the earth, I came to a    city whose inhabitants dwelt together, happy, prosperous, and secure. I    made myself well acquainted with the place and the people, but, despite    all my efforts, I was unable to entrap a single one. \"This is no place    for me,\" I said, \"I had better return to my own country.\" I left the    city, and, journeying on, came across a river, at the brink of which I    seated myself. Scarcely had I done so, when a woman appeared bearing her    garments to be washed in the river. She looked at me, and asked, \"Art    thou of the children of men or of demons?\" \"Well,\" said I, \"I have grown    up among men, but I was born among demons.\" \"But what art thou after    here?\" \"Ah,\" I replied, \"I have spent a whole month in yonder city. And    what have I found? A city full of friends, enjoying every happiness in    common. In vain have I tried to put a little of wickedness among them.\"    Then the woman, with a supercilious air: \"If I am to take thee for a    specimen, I must have a very poor opinion of the whole tribe of demons.    You seem mighty enough, but you haven't the strength of women. Stop here    and keep an eye on the wash; but mind, play me no tricks. I will go back    to the city and kindle therein fire and fury, and pour over it a spirit    of mischief, and thou shalt see how I can manage things.\" \"Agreed!\" said    I, \"I will stay here and await thy coming, and watch how affairs turn out    in thy hands.\"      The washerwoman departed, went into the city, called upon one of the    great families there residing, and requested to see the lady of the    house. She asked for a washing order, which she promised to execute to    the most perfect satisfaction. While the housemaid was collecting the    linen, the washerwoman lifted her eyes to the beautiful face of the    mistress, and exclaimed: \"Yes, they are a dreadful lot, the men; they are    all alike, a malediction on them! The best of them is not to be trusted.    They love all women but their own wives.\" \"What dost thou mean?\" asked    the lady. \"Merely this,\" she answered. \"Coming hither from my house, whom    should I meet but thy husband making love to another woman, and such a    hideous creature, too! How he could forsake beauty so rare and exquisite    as thine for such disgusting ugliness, passes my understanding. But do    not weep, dear lady, don't distress thyself and give way. I know a means    by which I shall bring that husband of thine to his senses, so that thou    shalt suffer no reproach, and he shall never love any other woman than    thee. This is what thou must do. When thy husband comes home, speak    softly and sweetly to him; let him suspect nothing; and when he has    fallen asleep, take a sharp razor and cut off three hairs from his beard;    black or white hairs, it matters not. These thou must afterwards give to    me, and with them I will compound such a remedy that his eyes shall be    darkened in their sockets, so that he will look no more upon other lovely    women, but cling to thee alone in mighty and manifest and enduring love.\"    All this the lady promised, and gifts besides for the washerwoman, should    her plan prosper.      Carrying the garments with her, the woman now sought out the lady's    husband. With every sign of distress in her voice and manner, she told    him that she had a frightful secret to divulge to him. She knew not if    she would have the strength to do so. She would rather die first The    husband was all the more eager to know, and would not be refused. \"Well,    then,\" she said, \"I have just been to thy house, where my lady, thy wife,    gave me these garments to wash; and, while I was yet standing there, a    youth, of handsome mien and nobly attired, arrived, and the two withdrew    into an adjoining room: so I inclined mine ear to listen to their speech,    and this is what I overheard: The young man said to thy wife, 'Kill thy    husband, and I will marry thee,' She, however, declared that she was    afraid to do such a dreadful deed. 'O,' answered he, 'with a little    courage it is quite easy. When thy husband is asleep, take a sharp razor    and cut his throat.'\" In fierce rage, but suppressing all outward    indication of it, the husband returned home. Pretending to fall asleep,    he watched his wife closely, saw her take a razor to sever the three    hairs for the washerwoman's spell, darted up suddenly, wrested the razor    from her hands, and with it slew his wife on the spot.      The news spread; the relations of the wife united to avenge her death,    and kill the husband. In their turn his relatives resolved to avenge him;    both houses were embroiled, and before the feud was at an end, two    hundred and thirty lives were sacrificed. The city resounded with a great    cry, the like of which had never been heard. \"From that day,\" concluded    Enan, \"I decided to injure no man more. Yet for this very reason I fear    to wed an evil woman.\" \"Fear not,\" returned Joseph, \"the girl I recommend    is beautiful and good.\" And Enan married her, and loved her.    Thus Enan is metamorphosed from a public demon into something of a domestic  saint. Zabara gives us an inverted Faust.      JOSEPH RETURNS HOME TO BARCELONA    \"After a while,\" concludes Joseph, \"I said to him, 'I have sojourned long  enough in this city, the ways of which please me not. Ignorance prevails,  and poetry is unknown; the law is despised; the young are set over the old;  they slander and are impudent. Let me go home after my many years of  wandering in a strange land. Fain would I seek the place where dwells the  great prince, Rabbi Sheshet Benveniste, of whom Wisdom says, Thou art my  teacher, and Faith, Thou art my friend.' 'What qualitie,' asked Enan,  'brought him to this lofty place of righteousness and"]]]
