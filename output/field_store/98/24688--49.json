I have the honour to remain,    Your Excellency's faithful servant,    (Sd.) M.K. GANDHI.    Laburnam Road, Gamdevi, Bombay    22nd June 1920      THE PREMIER'S REPLY    The English mail has brought us a full and official report of the  Premier's speech which he recently made when he received the Khilafat  deputation. Mr. Lloyd George's speech is more definite and therefore  more disappointing than H.E. the Viceroy's reply to the deputation here.  He draws quite unwarranted deductions from the same high principles on  which he had based his own pledge only two years ago. He declares that  Turkey must pay the penalty of defeat. This determination to punish  Turkey does not become one whose immediate predecessor had, in order to  appease Muslim soldiers, promised that the British Government had no  designs on Turkey and that His Majesty's Government would never think of  punishing the Sultan for the misdeeds of the Turkish Committee. Mr.  Lloyd George has expressed his belief that the majority of the  population of Turkey did not really want to quarrel with Great Britain  and that their rulers misled the country. In spite of this conviction  and in spite of Mr. Asquith's promise, he is out to punish Turkey and  punish it in the name of justice.    He expounds the principle of self-determination and justifies the scheme  of depriving Turkey of its territories one after another. While  justifying this scheme he does not exclude even Thrace and this strikes  the reader most, because this very Thrace he had mentioned in his pledge  as predominantly Turkish. Now we are told by him that both the Turkish  census and the Greek census agree in pointing out the Mussulman  population in Thrace is in a considerable minority! Mr. Yakub Hussain  speaking at the Madras Khilafat conference has challenged the truth of  this statement. The Prime Minister cites among others also the example  of Smyrna where, he says, we had a most careful investigation by a very  impartial committee in the whole of the question of Smyrna and it was  found that considerable majority was non-Turkish.' Who will believe the  one-sided \"impartial committee's\" investigations until it is disproved  that thousands of Musselmans have been murdered and hundreds of  thousands have been driven away from their hearths and homes? Strangely  enough Mr. Lloyd George, believes in the necessity of fresh  investigations by a purposely appointed committee in Smyrna as the most  authenticated and up-to-date report, whereas he would not accept Mr.  Mahomed Ali's proposal for an impartial commission in regard to Armenian  massacre! Doubtful and one-sided facts and figures suffice for him even  to conclude that the Turkish Government is incapable of protecting its  subjects. And he proceeds to suggest foreign interference in ruling over  Asia Minor in the interests of civilization. Here he cuts at the root of  the Sultan's independence. This proposal of appropriating supervision is  distinctly unlike the treatment meted out to other enemy powers.    This detraction of the Sultan's suzerainty is only a corollary of the  Premier's indifference towards the Muslim idea of the Caliphate. The  premier's injustice in treating the Turkish question becomes graver when  he thus lightly handles the Khilafat question. There had been occasions  when the British have used to their advantage the Muslim idea of  associating the Caliph's spiritual power with temporal power. Now this  very association is treated as a controversial question by the great  statesman.    Will this raise the reputation of Great Britain or stain it? Can this be  tolerated by those who fought against Turkey with full faith in British  honesty? Mere receipts of gratitude cannot console the wounded  Mussalmans. There lies the alternative for England to choose between two  mandates--a mandate over some Turkish territories which is sure to lead  to chaos all over the world and a mandate over the hearts of the  Muhomedans which will redeem the pledged honour of Britain. The prime  minister has an unwise choice. This narrow view registers the latest  temperature of British diplomacy.      THE MUSSULMAN REPRESENTATION    Slowly but surely the Mussulmans are preparing for the battle before  them. They have to fight against odds that are undoubtedly heavy but  not half as heavy as the prophet had against him. How often did he not  put his life in danger? But his faith in God was unquenchable. He went  forward with a light heart, for God was on his side, for he represented  truth. If his followers have half the prophet's faith and half his  spirit of sacrifice, the odds will be presently even and will in little  while turn against the despoilers of Turkey. Already the rapacity of the  Allies is telling against themselves. France finds her task difficult.  Greece cannot stomach her ill-gotten gains. And England finds  Mesopotamia a tough job. The oil of Mosul may feed the fire she has so  wantonly lighted and burn her fingers badly. The newspapers say the  Arabs do not like the presence of the Indian soldiery in their midst. I  do not wonder. They are a fierce and a brave people and do not  understand why Indian soldiers should find themselves in Mesopotamia.  Whatever the fate of non-co-operation, I wish that not a single Indian  will offer his services for Mesopotamia whether for the civil or the  military department. We must learn to think for ourselves and before  entering upon any employment find out whether thereby we may not make  ourselves instruments of injustice. Apart from the question of Khilafat  and from the point of abstract justice the English have no right to hold  Mesopotamia. It is no part of our loyalty to help the Imperial  Government in what is in plain language daylight robbery. If therefore  we seek civil or military employment in Mesopotamia we do so for the  sake of earning a livelihood. It is our duty to see that the source is  not tainted.    It surprises me to find so many people shirking over the mention of  non-co-operation. There is no instrument so clean, so harmless and yet  so effective as non-co-operation. Judiciously hauled it need not produce  any evil consequences. And its intensity will depend purely on the  capacity of the people for sacrifice.    The chief thing is to prepare the atmosphere of non-co-operation. \"We  are not going to co-operate with you in your injustice,\" is surely the  right and the duty of every intelligent subject to say. Were it not for  our utter servility, helplessness and want of confidence in ourselves,  we would certainly grasp this clean weapon and make the most effective  use of it. Even the most despotic government cannot stand except for the  consent of the governed which consent is often forcibly procured by the  despot. Immediately the subject ceases to fear the despotic force his  power is gone. But the British government is never and nowhere entirely  or laid upon force. It does make an honest attempt to secure the  goodwill of the governed. But it does not hesitate to adopt unscrupulous  means to compel the consent of the governed. It has not gone beyond the  'Honesty is the best policy' idea. It therefore bribes you into  consenting its will by awarding titles, medals and ribbons, by giving  you employment, by its superior financial ability to open for its  employees avenues for enriching themselves and finally when these fail,  it resorts to force. That is what Sir Michael O'Dwyer did and that is  almost every British administrator will certainly do if he thought it  necessary. If then we would not be greedy, if we would not run after  titles and medals and honorary posts which do the country no good, half  the battle is won.    My advisers are never tired of telling me that even if the Turkish peace  terms are revised it will not be due to non-co-operation. I venture to  suggest to them that non-co-operation has a higher purpose than mere  revision of the terms. If I cannot compel revision I must at least cease  to support a government that becomes party to the usurpation. And if I  succeed in pushing non-co-operation to the extreme limit, I do compel  the Government to choose between India and the usurpation. I have faith  enough in England to know that at that moment England will expel her  present jaded ministers and put in others who will make a clean sweep of  the terms in consultation with an awakened India, draft terms that will  be honourable to her, to Turkey and acceptable to India. But I hear my  critics say \"India has not the strength of purpose and the capacity for  the sacrifice to achieve such a noble end. They are partly right. India  has not these qualities now, because we have not--shall we not evolve  them and infect the nation with them? Is not the attempt worth making?  Is my sacrifice too great to gain such a great purpose?\"      CRITICISM OF THE MUSLIM MANIFESTO    The Khilafat representation addressed to the Viceroy and my letter on  the same subject have been severely criticised by the Anglo-Indian  press. _The Times of India_ which generally adopts an impartial attitude  has taken strong exception to certain statements made in the Muslim  manifesto and has devoted a paragraph of its article to an advance  criticism of my suggestion that His Excellency should resign if the  peace terms are not revised.    _The Times of India_ excepts to the submission that the British Empire  may not treat Turkey like a departed enemy. The signatories have, I  think, supplied the best of reasons. They say \"We respectfully submit  that in the treatment of Turkey the British Government are bound to  respect Indian Muslim sentiment in so far as it is neither unjust nor  unreasonable.\" If the seven crore Mussulmans are partners in the Empire,  I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#9)"],[1," the tepee, and hung a blackened  coffeepot on one of the prongs of a forked pole which leaned over the  flames. Placing a pan on a heap of red embers, she baked some unleavened  bread. This light luncheon she brought into the cabin, and arranged on a  table covered with a checkered oilcloth.    My mother had never gone to school, and though she meant always to give  up her own customs for such of the white man's ways as pleased her, she  made only compromises. Her two windows, directly opposite each other,  she curtained with a pink-flowered print. The naked logs were unstained,  and rudely carved with the axe so as to fit into one another. The sod  roof was trying to boast of tiny sunflowers, the seeds of which had  probably been planted by the constant wind. As I leaned my head against  the logs, I discovered the peculiar odor that I could not forget. The  rains had soaked the earth and roof so that the smell of damp clay was  but the natural breath of such a dwelling.    \"Mother, why is not your house cemented? Do you have no interest in a  more comfortable shelter?\" I asked, when the apparent inconveniences of  her home seemed to suggest indifference on her part.    \"You forget, my child, that I am now old, and I do not work with beads  any more. Your brother Dawee, too, has lost his position, and we are  left without means to buy even a morsel of food,\" she replied.    Dawee was a government clerk in our reservation when I last heard from  him. I was surprised upon hearing what my mother said concerning his  lack of employment. Seeing the puzzled expression on my face, she  continued: \"Dawee! Oh, has he not told you that the Great Father at  Washington sent a white son to take your brother's pen from him? Since  then Dawee has not been able to make use of the education the Eastern  school has given him.\"    I found no words with which to answer satisfactorily. I found no reason  with which to cool my inflamed feelings.    Dawee was a whole day's journey off on the prairie, and my mother did  not expect him until the next day. We were silent.    When, at length, I raised my head to hear more clearly the moaning of  the wind in the corner logs, I noticed the daylight streaming into the  dingy room through several places where the logs fitted unevenly.  Turning to my mother, I urged her to tell me more about Dawee's trouble,  but she only said: \"Well, my daughter, this village has been these many  winters a refuge for white robbers. The Indian cannot complain to the  Great Father in Washington without suffering outrage for it here. Dawee  tried to secure justice for our tribe in a small matter, and today you  see the folly of it.\"    Again, though she stopped to hear what I might say, I was silent.    \"My child, there is only one source of justice, and I have been praying  steadfastly to the Great Spirit to avenge our wrongs,\" she said, seeing  I did not move my lips.    My shattered energy was unable to hold longer any faith, and I cried out  desperately: \"Mother, don't pray again! The Great Spirit does not care  if we live or die! Let us not look for good or justice: then we shall  not be disappointed!\"    \"Sh! my child, do not talk so madly. There is Taku Iyotan Wasaka,[1] to  which I pray,\" she answered, as she stroked my head again as she used to  do when I was a smaller child.    [Footnote 1: An absolute Power.]          III.    MY MOTHER'S CURSE UPON WHITE SETTLERS.      One black night mother and I sat alone in the dim starlight, in front of  our wigwam. We were facing the river, as we talked about the shrinking  limits of the village. She told me about the poverty-stricken white  settlers, who lived in caves dug in the long ravines of the high hills  across the river.    A whole tribe of broad-footed white beggars had rushed hither to make  claims on those wild lands. Even as she was telling this I spied a small  glimmering light in the bluffs.    \"That is a white man's lodge where you see the burning fire,\" she said.  Then, a short distance from it, only a little lower than the first, was  another light. As I became accustomed to the night, I saw more and more  twinkling lights, here and there, scattered all along the wide black  margin of the river.    Still looking toward the distant firelight, my mother continued: \"My  daughter, beware of the paleface. It was the cruel paleface who caused  the death of your sister and your uncle, my brave brother. It is this  same paleface who offers in one palm the holy papers, and with the  other gives a holy baptism of firewater. He is the hypocrite who reads  with one eye, 'Thou shalt not kill,' and with the other gloats upon the  sufferings of the Indian race.\" Then suddenly discovering a new fire in  the bluffs, she exclaimed, \"Well, well, my daughter, there is the light  of another white rascal!\"    She sprang to her feet, and, standing firm beside her wigwam, she sent a  curse upon those who sat around the hated white man's light. Raising her  right arm forcibly into line with her eye, she threw her whole might  into her doubled fist as she shot it vehemently at the strangers. Long  she held her outstretched fingers toward the settler's lodge, as if an  invisible power passed from them to the evil at which she aimed.          IV.    RETROSPECTION.      Leaving my mother, I returned to the school in the East. As months  passed over me, I slowly comprehended that the large army of white  teachers in Indian schools had a larger missionary creed than I had  suspected.    It was one which included self-preservation quite as much as Indian  education. When I saw an opium-eater holding a position as teacher of  Indians, I did not understand what good was expected, until a Christian  in power replied that this pumpkin-colored creature had a feeble mother  to support. An inebriate paleface sat stupid in a doctor's chair, while  Indian patients carried their ailments to untimely graves, because his  fair wife was dependent upon him for her daily food.    I find it hard to count that white man a teacher who tortured an  ambitious Indian youth by frequently reminding the brave changeling that  he was nothing but a \"government pauper.\"    Though I burned with indignation upon discovering on every side  instances no less shameful than those I have mentioned, there was no  present help. Even the few rare ones who have worked nobly for my race  were powerless to choose workmen like themselves. To be sure, a man was  sent from the Great Father to inspect Indian schools, but what he saw  was usually the students' sample work _made_ for exhibition. I was  nettled by this sly cunning of the workmen who hookwinked the Indian's  pale Father at Washington.    My illness, which prevented the conclusion of my college course,  together with my mother's stories of the encroaching frontier settlers,  left me in no mood to strain my eyes in searching for latent good in my  white co-workers.    At this stage of my own evolution, I was ready to curse men of small  capacity for being the dwarfs their God had made them. In the process of  my education I had lost all consciousness of the nature world about me.  Thus, when a hidden rage took me to the small white-walled prison which  I then called my room, I unknowingly turned away from my one salvation.    Alone in my room, I sat like the petrified Indian woman of whom my  mother used to tell me. I wished my heart's burdens would turn me to  unfeeling stone. But alive, in my tomb, I was destitute!    For the white man's papers I had given up my faith in the Great Spirit.  For these same papers I had forgotten the healing in trees and brooks.  On account of my mother's simple view of life, and my lack of any, I  gave her up, also. I made no friends among the race of people I loathed.  Like a slender tree, I had been uprooted from my mother, nature, and  God. I was shorn of my branches, which had waved in sympathy and love  for home and friends. The natural coat of bark which had protected my  oversensitive nature was scraped off to the very quick.    Now a cold bare pole I seemed to be, planted in a strange earth. Still,  I seemed to hope a day would come when my mute aching head, reared  upward to the sky, would flash a zigzag lightning across the heavens.  With this dream of vent for a long-pent consciousness, I walked again  amid the crowds.    At last, one weary day in the schoolroom, a new idea presented itself to  me. It was a new way of solving the problem of my inner self. I liked  it. Thus I resigned my position as teacher; and now I am in an Eastern  city, following the long course of study I have set for myself. Now, as  I look back upon the recent past, I see it from a distance, as a whole.  I remember how, from morning till evening, many specimens of civilized  peoples visited the Indian school. The city folks with canes and  eyeglasses, the countrymen with sunburnt cheeks and clumsy feet, forgot  their relative social ranks in an ignorant curiosity. Both sorts of  these Christian palefaces were alike astounded at seeing the children of  savage warriors so docile and industrious.    As answers to their shallow inquiries they received the students' sample  work to look upon. Examining the neatly figured pages, and gazing upon  the Indian girls and boys bending over their books, the white visitors  walked out of the schoolhouse well satisfied: they were educating the  children of the red man! They were paying a liberal fee to the  government employees in whose able hands lay the small forest of Indian  timber.    In this fashion many have passed idly through the Indian schools during  the last decade, afterward to boast of their charity to the North  American Indian. But few there are who have paused to question whether  real life or long-lasting death lies beneath this semblance of  civilization.          THE GREAT SPIRIT      When the spirit swells my breast I love to roam leisurely among the  green hills; or sometimes,"]]]
