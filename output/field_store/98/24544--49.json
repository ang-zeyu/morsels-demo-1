De Monts extended to Champlain an invitation to join the expedition, which  he readily accepted, but, nevertheless, on the condition, as in the  previous voyage, of the king's assent, which was freely granted,  nevertheless with the command that he should prepare a faithful report of  his observations and discoveries.    ENDNOTES:    18. Blavet was situated at the mouth of the River Blavet, on the southern      coast of Brittany. Its occupation had been granted to the Spanish by      the Duke de Mercoeur during the civil war, and, with other places held      by the Spanish, was surrendered by the treaty of Vervins, in June,      1598. It was rebuilt and fortified by Louis XIII, and is now known as      Port Louis.    19. _Deseada_, signifying in Spanish the desired land.    20. _Margarita_, a Spanish word from the Greek [Greek: margaritaes],      signifying a pearl. The following account by an eye-witness will not be      uninteresting: \"Especially it yieldeth store of pearls, those gems      which the Latin writers call _Uniones_, because _nulli duo reperiuntur      discreti_, they always are found to grow in couples. In this Island      there are many rich Merchants who have thirty, forty, fifty _Blackmore_      slaves only to fish out of the sea about the rocks these pearls....      They are let down in baskets into the Sea, and so long continue under      the water, until by pulling the rope by which they are let down, they      make their sign to be taken up.... From _Margarita_ are all the Pearls      sent to be refined and bored to _Carthagena_, where is a fair and      goodly street of no other shops then of these Pearl dressers. Commonly      in the month of _July_ there is a ship or two at most ready in the      Island to carry the King's revenue, and the Merchant's pearls to      _Carthagena_. One of these ships is valued commonly at three score      thousand or four score thousand ducats and sometimes more, and      therefore are reasonable well manned; for that the _Spaniards_ much      fear our _English_ and the _Holland_ ships.\"--_Vide New Survey of the      West Indies_, by Thomas Gage, London, 1677, p. 174.    21. _Caymans_, Crocodiles.    22.

At the time that Champlain was at the isthmus, in 1599-1601, the gold      and silver of Peru were brought to Panama, then transported on mules a      distance of about four leagues to a river, known as the Rio Chagres,      whence they were conveyed by water first to Chagres, and thence along      the coast to Porto-bello, and there shipped to Spain.        Champlain refers to a ship-canal in the following words: \"One might      judge, if the territory four leagues in extent lying between Panama and      this river were cut through, he could pass from the south sea to that      on the other side, and thus shorten the route by more than fifteen      hundred leagues. From Panama to the Straits of Magellan would      constitute an island, and from Panama to New Foundland another, so that      the whole of America would be in two islands.\"--_Vide Brief Discours      des Choses Plus Remarquables_, par Sammuel Champlain de Brovage, 1599,      Quebec ed., Vol. I. p 141. This project of a ship canal across the      isthmus thus suggested by Champlain two hundred and eighty years ago is      now attracting the public attention both in this country and in Europe.      Several schemes are on foot for bringing it to pass, and it will      undoubtedly be accomplished, if it shall be found after the most      careful and thorough investigation to be within the scope of human      power, and to offer adequate commercial advantages.        Some of the difficulties to be overcome are suggested by Mr. Marsh in      the following excerpt--        \"The most colossal project of canalization ever suggested, whether we      consider the physical difficulties of its execution, the magnitude and      importance of the waters proposed to be united, or the distance which      would be saved in navigation, is that of a channel between the Gulf of      Mexico and the Pacific, across the Isthmus of Darien. I do not now      speak of a lock-canal, by way of the Lake of Nicaragua, or any other      route,--for such a work would not differ essentially from other canals      and would scarcely possess a geographical character,--but of an open      cut between the two seas. The late survey by Captain Selfridge, showing      that the lowest point on the dividing ridge is 763 feet above the      sea-level, must be considered as determining in the negative the      question of the possibility of such a cut, by any means now at the      control of man; and both the sanguine expectations of benefits, and the      dreary suggestions of danger from the realization of this great dream,      may now be dismissed as equally chimerical.\"--_Vide The Earth as      Modified by Human Action_, by George P.

No positive evidence is known to exist as to the time when Champlain      was ennobled. It seems most likely to have been in acknowledgment of      his valuable report made to Henry IV. after his visit to the West      Indies.    26. Amyar de Chastes died on the 13th of May, 1603, greatly respected and      beloved by his fellow-citizens. He was charged by his government with      many important and responsible duties. In 1583, he was sent by Henry      III., or rather by Catherine de Medicis, to the Azores with a military      force to sustain the claims of Antonio, the Prior of Crato, to the      throne of Portugal. He was a warm friend and supporter of Henry IV.,      and took an active part in the battles of Ivry and Arques. He commanded      the French fleet on the coasts of Brittany; and, during the long      struggle of this monarch with internal enemies and external foes, he      was in frequent communication with the English to secure their      co-operation, particularly against the Spanish. He accompanied the Duke      de Boullon, the distinguished Huguenot nobleman, to England, to be      present and witness the oath of Queen Elizabeth to the treaty made with      France.        On this occasion he received a valuable jewel as a present from the      English queen. He afterwards directed the ceremonies and entertainment      of the Earl of Shrewsbury, who was deputed to receive the ratification      of the before-mentioned treaty by Henry IV. _Vide Busk's His.

He had been associated with      Chauvin in the Canada trade, and continued to visit the St Lawrence for      this purpose almost yearly for thirty years.        He was greatly respected by Champlain, and was closely associated with      him till 1629. After the English captured Quebec, he appears to have      retired, forced to do so by the infirmities of age.    29. Jean Parmentier, of Dieppe, author of the _Discorso d'un gran capitano_      in Ramusio, Vol. III., p. 423, wrote in the year 1539, and he says the      Bretons and Normans were in our northern waters thirty-five years      before, which would be in 1504. _Vide_ Mr. Parkman's learned note and      citations in _Pioneers of France in the New World_, pp. 171, 172. The      above is doubtless the authority on which the early writers, such as      Pierre Biard, Champlain, and others, make the year 1504 the period when      the French voyages for fishing commenced.    30. _Vide Voyage of Iohn Alphonse of Xanctoigne_, Hakluyt, Vol. III., p.      293.    31.

The Duke of Sully's disapprobation is expressed in the following words:      \"The colony that was sent to Canada this year, was among the number of      those things that had not my approbation; there was no kind of riches      to be expected from all those countries of the new world, which are      beyond the fortieth degree of latitude.

He had been  left in Oxford when that city was surrendered, and had been taken  captive there by the Republican army. The general in command sent him  to London a prisoner. It was hard for such a child to be a captive,  but then there was one solace in his lot. By being sent to London he  rejoined his little sister Elizabeth and his brother Henry, who had  remained there all the time. Henry was three years old and Elizabeth  was six. These children, being too young, as was supposed, to attempt  an escape, were not very closely confined. They were entrusted to the  charge of some of the nobility, and lived in one of the London palaces.  James was a very thoughtful and considerate boy, and had been enough  with his father in his campaigns to understand something of the terrible  dangers with which the family were surrounded. The other children were  too young to know or care about them, and played blindman's buff and  hide and go seek in the great saloons of the palace with as much  infantile glee as if their father and mother were as safe and happy  as ever.    Though they felt thus no uneasiness and anxiety for themselves, their  exiled mother mourned for them, and was oppressed by the most foreboding  fears for their personal safety. She thought, however, still more  frequently of the babe, and felt a still greater solicitude for her,  left as she had been, at so exceedingly tender an age, in a situation  of the most extreme and imminent danger. She felt somewhat guilty in  having yielded her reluctant consent, for political reasons, to have  her other children educated in what she believed a false system of  religious faith, and she now prayed earnestly to God to spare the life  of this her last and dearest child, and vowed in her anguish that, if  the babe were ever restored to her, she would break through all  restrictions, and bring her up a true believer. This vow she afterward  earnestly fulfilled.    The child, it will be recollected, was left, when Henrietta escaped  from Exeter, in the care of the Countess of Morton, a young and  beautiful, and also a very intelligent and energetic lady. The child  had a visit from its father soon after its mother left it. King Charles,  as soon as he heard that Essex was advancing to besiege Exeter, where  he knew that the queen had sought refuge, and was, of course, exposed  to fall into his power, hastened with an army to her rescue. He arrived  in time to prevent Essex from getting possession of the place. He, in  fact, drove the besieger away from the town, and entered it himself  in triumph. The queen was gone, but he found the child.    The king gazed upon the little stranger with a mixture of joy and  sorrow. He caused it to be baptized, and named it Henrietta Anne. The  name Henrietta was from the mother; Anne was the name of Henrietta's  sister-in-law in Paris, who had been very kind to her in all her  troubles. The king made ample arrangements for supplying Lady Morton  with money out of the revenues of the town of Exeter, and, thinking  that the child would be as safe in Exeter as any where, left her there,  and went away to resume again his desperate conflicts with his political  foes.    Lady Morton remained for some time at Exeter, but the king's cause  every where declined. His armies were conquered, his towns were taken,  and he was compelled at last to give himself up a prisoner. Exeter,  as well as all the other strongholds in the kingdom, fell into the  hands of the parliamentary armies. They sent Lady Morton and the little  Henrietta to London, and soon afterward provided them with a home in  the mansion at Oatlands, where the queen herself and her other children  had lived before. It was a quiet and safe retreat, but Lady Morton was  very little satisfied with the plan of remaining there. She wished  very much to get the babe back to its mother again in Paris. She heard,  at length, of rumors that a plan was forming by the Parliament to take  the child out of her charge, and she then resolved to attempt an escape  at all hazards.    Henrietta Anne was now two years old, and was beginning to talk a  little. When asked what was her name, they had taught her to attempt  to reply _princess_, though she did not succeed in uttering more than  the first letters of the word, her answer being, in fact, _prah_. Lady  Morton conceived the idea of making her escape across the country in  the disguise of a beggar woman, changing, at the same time, the princess  into a boy. She was herself very tall, and graceful, and beautiful,  and it was hard for her to make herself look old and ugly. She, however,  made a hump for her back out of a bundle of linen, and stooped in her  gait to counterfeit age. She dressed herself in soiled and ragged  clothes, disfigured her face by reversing the contrivances with which  ladies in very fashionable life are said sometimes to produce artificial  youth and beauty, and with the child in a bundle on her back, and a  staff in her hand, she watched for a favorable opportunity to escape  stealthily from the palace, in the forlorn hope of walking in that way  undetected to Dover, a march of fifty miles, through a country filled  with enemies.    Little Henrietta was to be a boy, and as people on the way might ask  the child its name, Lady Morton was obliged to select one for her which  would fit, in some degree, her usual reply to such a question. She  chose the name Pierre, which sounds, at least, as much like _prah_ as  princess does. The poor child, though not old enough to speak  distinctly, was still old enough to talk a great deal. She was very  indignant at the vile dress which she was compelled to wear, and at  being called a beggar boy. She persisted in telling every body whom  she met that she was not a boy, nor a beggar, nor Pierre, but the  _princess_ saying it all, however, very fortunately, in such an  unintelligible way, that it only alarmed Lady Morton, without, however,  attracting the attention of those who heard it, or giving them any  information.    Contrary to every reasonable expectation, Lady Morton succeeded in her  wild and romantic attempt. She reached Dover in safety. She made  arrangements for crossing in the packet boat, which then, as now, plied  from Dover to Calais. She landed at length safely on the French coast,  where she threw off her disguise, resumed her natural grace and beauty,  made known her true name and character, and traveled in ease and safety  to Paris. The excitement and the intoxicating joy which Henrietta  experienced when she got her darling child once more in her arms, can  be imagined, perhaps, even by the most sedate American mother; but the  wild and frantic violence of her expressions of it, none but those who  are conversant with the French character and French manners can know.    It was not very far from the time of little Henrietta's escape from  her father's enemies in London, though, in fact, before it, that Prince  Charles made his escape from the island too. His father, finding that  his cause was becoming desperate, gave orders to those who had charge  of his son to retreat to the southwestern coast of the island, and if  the Republican armies should press hard upon him there, he was to make  his escape, if necessary, by sea.    The southwestern part of England is a long, mountainous promontory,  constituting the county of Cornwall. It is a wild and secluded region,  and the range which forms it seems to extend for twenty or thirty miles  under the sea, where it rises again to the surface, forming a little  group of islands, more wild and rugged even than the land. These are  the Scilly Isles. They lie secluded and solitary, and are known chiefly  to mankind through the ships that seek shelter among them in storms.  Prince Charles retreated from post to post through Cornwall, the danger  becoming more and more imminent every day, till at last it became  necessary to fly from the country altogether. He embarked on board a  vessel, and went first to the Scilly Isles.    From Scilly he sailed eastward toward the coast of France. He landed  first at the island of Jersey, which, though it is very near the French  coast, and is inhabited by a French population, is under the English  government. Here the prince met with a very cordial reception, as the  authorities were strongly attached to his father's cause. Jersey is  a beautiful isle and, far enough south to enjoy a genial climate, where  flowers bloom and fruits ripen in the warm sunbeams, which are here  no longer intercepted by the driving mists and rains which sweep almost  perceptibly along the hill sides and fields of England.    Prince Charles did not, however, remain long in Jersey. His destination  was Paris. He passed, therefore, across to the main land, and traveled  to the capital. He was received with great honors at his mother's new  home, in the palace of the Louvre, as a royal prince, and heir apparent  to the British crown. He was now sixteen. The adventures which he met  with on his arrival will be the subject of the next chapter.    James, the Duke of York, remained still in London. He continued there  for two years, during which time his father's affairs went totally to  ruin. The unfortunate king, after his armies were all defeated, and  his cause was finally given up by his friends, and he had surrendered  himself a prisoner to his enemies, was taken from castle to castle,  every where strongly guarded and very closely confined. At length,  worn down with privations and sufferings, and despairing of all hope  of relief, he was taken to London to be tried for his life. James, in  the mean time, with his brother, the little Duke of Gloucester, and  his sister Elizabeth, were kept in St. James's Palace, as has already  been stated, under the care of an officer to whom they had been given  in charge.    The queen was particularly anxious to have James make his escape. He  was older than the"]]]
