If, however, the god of Heaven is the father  of the ruler, the ruler as his son himself offers sacrifice, and so the  priest becomes superfluous. Thus the priests became \"unemployed\". Some  of them changed their profession. They were the only people who could  read and write, and as an administrative system was necessary they  obtained employment as scribes. Others withdrew to their villages and  became village priests. They organized the religious festivals in the  village, carried out the ceremonies connected with family events, and  even conducted the exorcism of evil spirits with shamanistic dances;  they took charge, in short, of everything connected with customary  observances and morality. The Chou lords were great respecters of  propriety. The Shang culture had, indeed, been a high one with an  ancient and highly developed moral system, and the Chou as rough  conquerors must have been impressed by the ancient forms and tried to  imitate them. In addition, they had in their religion of Heaven a  conception of the existence of mutual relations between Heaven and  Earth: all that went on in the skies had an influence on earth, and vice  versa. Thus, if any ceremony was \"wrongly\" performed, it had an evil  effect on Heaven--there would be no rain, or the cold weather would  arrive too soon, or some such misfortune would come. It was therefore of  great importance that everything should be done \"correctly\". Hence the  Chou rulers were glad to call in the old priests as performers of  ceremonies and teachers of morality similar to the ancient Indian rulers  who needed the Brahmans for the correct performance of all rites. There  thus came into existence in the early Chou empire a new social group,  later called \"scholars\", men who were not regarded as belonging to the  lower class represented by the subjugated population but were not  included in the nobility; men who were not productively employed but  belonged to a sort of independent profession. They became of very great  importance in later centuries.    In the first centuries of the Chou dynasty the ruling house steadily  lost power. Some of the emperors proved weak, or were killed at war;  above all, the empire was too big and its administration too  slow-moving. The feudal lords and nobles were occupied with their own  problems in securing the submission of the surrounding villages to their  garrisons and in governing them; they soon paid little attention to the  distant central authority. In addition to this, the situation at the  centre of the empire was more difficult than that of its feudal states  farther east. The settlements around the garrisons in the east were  inhabited by agrarian tribes, but the subjugated population around the  centre at Sian was made up of nomadic tribes of Turks and Mongols  together with semi-nomadic Tibetans. Sian lies in the valley of the  river Wei; the riverside country certainly belonged, though perhaps only  insecurely, to the Shang empire and was specially well adapted to  agriculture; but its periphery--mountains in the south, steppes in the  north--was inhabited (until a late period, to some extent to the present  day) by nomads, who had also been subjugated by the Chou. The Chou  themselves were by no means strong, as they had been only a small tribe  and their strength had depended on auxiliary tribes, which had now  spread over the country as the new nobility and lived far from the Chou.  The Chou emperors had thus to hold in check the subjugated but warlike  tribes of Turks and Mongols who lived quite close to their capital. In  the first centuries of the dynasty they were more or less successful,  for the feudal lords still sent auxiliary forces. In time, however,  these became fewer and fewer, because the feudal lords pursued their own  policy; and the Chou were compelled to fight their own battles against  tribes that continually rose against them, raiding and pillaging their  towns. Campaigns abroad also fell mainly on the shoulders of the Chou,  as their capital lay near the frontier.    It must not be simply assumed, as is often done by the Chinese and some  of the European historians, that the Turkish and Mongolian tribes were  so savage or so pugnacious that they continually waged war just for the  love of it. The problem is much deeper, and to fail to recognize this is  to fail to understand Chinese history down to the Middle Ages. The  conquering Chou established their garrisons everywhere, and these  garrisons were surrounded by the quarters of artisans and by the  villages of peasants, a process that ate into the pasturage of the  Turkish and Mongolian nomads. These nomads, as already mentioned,  pursued agriculture themselves on a small scale, but it occurred to them  that they could get farm produce much more easily by barter or by  raiding. Accordingly they gradually gave up cultivation and became pure  nomads, procuring the needed farm produce from their neighbours. This  abandonment of agriculture brought them into a precarious situation: if  for any reason the Chinese stopped supplying or demanded excessive  barter payment, the nomads had to go hungry. They were then virtually  driven to get what they needed by raiding. Thus there developed a mutual  reaction that lasted for centuries. Some of the nomadic tribes living  between garrisons withdrew, to escape from the growing pressure, mainly  into the province of Shansi, where the influence of the Chou was weak  and they were not numerous; some of the nomad chiefs lost their lives in  battle, and some learned from the Chou lords and turned themselves into  petty rulers. A number of \"marginal\" states began to develop; some of  them even built their own cities. This process of transformation of  agro-nomadic tribes into \"warrior-nomadic\" tribes continued over many  centuries and came to an end in the third or second century B.C.    The result of the three centuries that had passed was a symbiosis  between the urban aristocrats and the country-people. The rulers of the  towns took over from the general population almost the whole vocabulary  of the language which from now on we may call \"Chinese\". They naturally  took over elements of the material civilization. The subjugated  population had, meanwhile, to adjust itself to its lords. In the  organism that thus developed, with its unified economic system, the  conquerors became an aristocratic ruling class, and the subjugated  population became a lower class, with varied elements but mainly a  peasantry. From now on we may call this society \"Chinese\"; it has  endured to the middle of the twentieth century. Most later essential  societal changes are the result of internal development and not of  aggression from without.    4 _Limitation of the imperial power_    In 771 B.C. an alliance of northern feudal states had attacked the ruler  in his western capital; in a battle close to the city they had overcome  and killed him. This campaign appears to have set in motion considerable  groups from various tribes, so that almost the whole province of Shensi  was lost. With the aid of some feudal lords who had remained loyal, a  Chou prince was rescued and conducted eastward to the second capital,  Loyang, which until then had never been the ruler's actual place of  residence. In this rescue a lesser feudal prince, ruler of the feudal  state of Ch'in, specially distinguished himself. Soon afterwards this  prince, whose domain had lain close to that of the ruler, reconquered a  great part of the lost territory, and thereafter regarded it as his own  fief. The Ch'in family resided in the same capital in which the Chou  had lived in the past, and five hundred years later we shall meet with  them again as the dynasty that succeeded the Chou.    The new ruler, resident now in Loyang, was foredoomed to impotence. He  was now in the centre of the country, and less exposed to large-scale  enemy attacks; but his actual rule extended little beyond the town  itself and its immediate environment. Moreover, attacks did not entirely  cease; several times parts of the indigenous population living between  the Chou towns rose against the towns, even in the centre of the  country.    Now that the emperor had no territory that could be the basis of a  strong rule and, moreover, because he owed his position to the feudal  lords and was thus under an obligation to them, he ruled no longer as  the chief of the feudal lords but as a sort of sanctified overlord; and  this was the position of all his successors. A situation was formed at  first that may be compared with that of Japan down to the middle of the  nineteenth century. The ruler was a symbol rather than an exerciser of  power. There had to be a supreme ruler because, in the worship of Heaven  which was recognized by all the feudal lords, the supreme sacrifices  could only be offered by the Son of Heaven in person. There could not be  a number of sons of heaven because there were not a number of heavens.  The imperial sacrifices secured that all should be in order in the  country, and that the necessary equilibrium between Heaven and Earth  should be maintained. For in the religion of Heaven there was a close  parallelism between Heaven and Earth, and every omission of a sacrifice,  or failure to offer it in due form, brought down a reaction from Heaven.  For these religious reasons a central ruler was a necessity for the  feudal lords. They needed him also for practical reasons. In the course  of centuries the personal relationship between the various feudal lords  had ceased. Their original kinship and united struggles had long been  forgotten. When the various feudal lords proceeded to subjugate the  territories at a distance from their towns, in order to turn their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#9)"],[1,"d, and keeping  the old normal gauge. It is nevertheless evident that it is impossible  to construct cheap railways on the normal gauge system, as the  maintenance of such would-be light railways is in proportion far more  costly than that of standard railways.    The narrow gauge is entirely in its right place in countries where, as  notably in the case of the colonies, the traffic is not sufficiently  extensive to warrant the capitalization of the expenses of construction  of a normal gauge railway.    Quite recently the Eastern Railway Company of the province of Buenos  Ayres have adopted the narrow gauge for connecting two of their  stations, the gauge being 24 in. and the weight of the rails 19 lb. per  yard. This company have constructed altogether six miles of narrow-gauge  road, with a rolling stock of thirty passenger carriages and goods  trucks and two engines, at a net cost price of 7,500l., the engines  included. This line works as regularly as the main line with which it is  connected. The composite carriages in use leave nothing to be desired  with regard to their appearance and the comforts they offer. Third-class  carriages, covered and open, and covered goods wagons, are also  employed.    All these carriages are constructed according to the model of those of  the Festiniog Railway. The engines weigh 4 tons, and run at 121/2 miles  per hour for express trains with a live load of 16 tons; while for goods  trains carrying 35 tons the rate is 71/2 miles an hour.    Another purpose for which the narrow-gauge road is of the highest  importance in colonial commerce is the transport of sugar cane. There  are two systems in use for the service of sugar plantations:    1. Traction by horses, mules, or oxen.    2. Traction by steam-engine.    In the former case, the narrow gauge, 20 in. with 14 lb. rails, is used,  with platform trucks and iron baskets 3 ft. 3 in. long.    The use of these wagons is particularly advantageous for clearing away  the sugar cane from the fields, because, as the crop to be carried off  is followed by another harvest, it is important to prevent the  destructive action of the wheels of heavily laden wagons. The baskets  may be made to contain as much as 1,300 lb. of cane for animal traction,  and 2,000 lb. for steam traction. In those colonies where the cane is  not cut up into pieces, long platform wagons are used entirely made of  metal, and on eight wheels. When the traction is effected by horses or  mules, a chain 141/2 ft. long is used, and the animals are driven  alongside the road. Oxen are harnessed to a yoke, longer by 20 in. to 24  in. than the ordinary yoke, and they are driven along on each side of  the road.    On plantations where it is desirable to have passenger carriages, or  where it is to be foreseen that the narrow-gauge line maybe required for  the regular transport of passengers and goods, the 20 in. line is  replaced by one of 24 in.    The transport of the refuse of sugar cane is effected by means of  tilting basket carts; the lower part of which consists of plate iron as  in earthwork wagons, while the upper part consists of an open grating,  offering thus a very great holding capacity without being excessively  heavy. The content of these wagons is 90 cubic feet (2,500 liters). To  use it for the transport of earth, sand, or rubbish, the grating has  merely to be taken off. In the case of the transport of sugar cane  having to be effected by steam power, the most suitable width of road is  24 in., with 19 lb. rails; and this line should be laid down and  ballasted most carefully. The cost of one mile of the 20 in. gauge road,  with 14 lb. rails, thirty basket wagons, and accessories for the  transport of sugar cane, is 700l., and the total weight of this plant  amounts to 35 tons.    Owing to the great lightness of the portable railways, and the facility  with which they can be worked, the attention of explorers has repeatedly  been attracted by them. The expedition of the Ogowe in October, 1880,  that of the Upper Congo in November, 1881, and the Congo mission under  Savorgnan de Brazza, have all made use of the Decauville narrow-gauge  railway system.    During these expeditions to Central Africa, one of the greatest  obstacles to be surmounted was the transport of boats where the river  ceased to be navigable; for it was then necessary to employ a great  number of negroes for carrying both the boats and the luggage. The  explorers were, more or less, left to the mercy of the natives, and but  very slow progress could be made.    On returning from one of these expeditions in Africa, Dr. Balay and M.  Mizon conceived the idea of applying to M. Decauville for advice as to  whether the narrow-gauge line might not be profitably adapted for the  expedition. M. Decauville proposed to them to transport their boats  without taking them to pieces, or unloading them, by placing them on two  pivot trollies, in the same manner as the guns are transported in  fortifications and in the field. The first experiments were made at  Petit-Bourg with a pleasure yacht. The hull, weighing 4 tons, was placed  on two gun trollies, and was moved about easily across country by means  of a portable line of 20 in. gauge, with 14 lb. rails. The length of the  hull was about 45 ft., depth 6 ft. 7 in., and breadth of beam 8 ft. 2  in., that is to say, five times the width of the narrow-gauge, and  notwithstanding all this the wheels never came off the line. The  sections of line were taken up and replaced as the boat advanced, and a  speed of 1,100 yards per hour was attained. Dr. Balay and M. Mizon  declared that the result obtained exceeded by far their most sanguine  hopes, because during their last voyage, the passage of the rapids had  sometimes required a whole week for 1,100 yards (1 kilometer), and they  considered themselves very lucky indeed if they could attain a speed of  one kilometer per day. The same narrow gauge system has since been three  times adopted by African explorers, on which occasions it was found that  the 20 in. line, with 9 lb. or 14 lb. rails, was the most suitable for  scientific expeditions of this nature.    The trucks used are of the kind usually employed for military purposes,  with wheels, axles, and pivot bearings of steel; on being dismounted the  bodies of the two trucks form a chest, which is bolted together and  contains the wheels, axles, and other accessories. The total weight of  the 135 yards of road used by Dr. Balay and M. Mizon during their first  voyage was 2,900 lb., and the wagons weighed 5,000 lb. Hence the  expedition had to carry a supplementary weight of 31/2 tons; but at any  given moment the material forming this burden became the means of  transporting, in its turn, seven boats, representing a total weight of  20 tons.    It is impossible to enumerate in this paper all the various kinds of  wagons and trucks suitable for the service of iron works, shipyards,  mines, quarries, forests, and many other kinds of works; and we  therefore limit ourselves to mentioning only a few instances which  suffice to show that the narrow gauge can be applied to works of the  most varied nature and under the most adverse circumstances possible.    It therefore only remains to mention the various accessories which have  been invented for the purpose of completing the system. They consist of  off-railers, crossings, turntables, etc.    The off railer is used for establishing a portable line, at any point,  diverging to the right or left of a permanent line, and for transferring  traffic to it without interruption. It consists of a miniature inclined  plane, of the same height at one end as the rail, tapering off regularly  by degrees toward the other end. It is only necessary to place the  off-railer (which, like all the lengths of rail of this system, forms  but one piece with its sleepers and fish-plates) on the fixed line,  adding a curve in the direction it is intended to go, and push the  wagons on to the off-railer, when they will gradually leave the fixed  line and pass on the new track.    The switches consist of a rail-end 49 in. in length, which serves as a  movable tongue, placed in front of a complete crossing, the rails of  which have a radius of 4, 6, or 8 meters; a push with the foot suffices  to alter the switch. There are four different models of crossings  constructed for each radius, viz.:    1. For two tracks with symmetrical divergence.    2. For a curve to the right and a straight track.    3. For a curve to the left and a straight track.    4. For a meeting of three tracks.    When a fixed line is used, it is better to replace the movable switch by  a fixed cast-iron switch, and to let the workmen who drive the wagon  push it in the direction required. Planed switch tongues are also used,  having the shape of those employed on the normal tracks, especially for  the passage of small engines; the switches are, in this case, completed  by the application of a hand lever.    The portable turntable consists of two faced plates laid over the other,  one of thick sheet iron, and the other of cast iron. The sheet-iron  plate is fitted with a pivot, around which the cast iron one is made to  revolve; these plates may either be smooth, or grooved for the wheels.  The former are used chiefly when it is required to turn wagons or trucks  of light burden, or, in the case of earthworks, for trucks of moderate  weight. These plates are quite portable; their weight for the 16 in.  gauge does not exceed 200 lb. For engineering works a turntable plate  with variable width of track has been designed, admitting of different  tracks being used over the same turntable.    When turntables are required for permanent lines, and to sustain heavy  burdens, turntables with a cast iron box are required, constructed on  the principle of the turntables of ordinary railways. The heaviest  wagons may be placed on these box turntables, without any"]]]
