Adventures of Robin Hood (#9)"],[1,"of the Sheriffs men  drinking right lustily; so, without speaking to anyone, he sat down upon  a distant bench, his staff in his hand, and his head bowed forward as  though he were meditating. Thus he sat waiting until he might see the  landlord apart, and Eadom did not know him, but thought him to be some  poor tired friar, so he let him sit without saying a word to him or  molesting him, though he liked not the cloth.  \"For,\" said he to  himself, \"it is a hard heart that kicks the lame dog from off the sill.\"  As Stutely sat thus, there came a great house cat and rubbed against his  knee, raising his robe a palm's-breadth high. Stutely pushed his robe  quickly down again, but the constable who commanded the Sheriffs men saw  what had passed, and saw also fair Lincoln green beneath the friar's  robe. He said nothing at the time, but communed within himself in this  wise: \"Yon is no friar of orders gray, and also, I wot, no honest yeoman  goeth about in priest's garb, nor doth a thief go so for nought. Now I  think in good sooth that is one of Robin Hood's own men.\" So, presently,  he said aloud, \"O holy father, wilt thou not take a good pot of March  beer to slake thy thirsty soul withal?\"    But Stutely shook his head silently, for he said to himself, \"Maybe  there be those here who know my voice.\"    Then the constable said again, \"Whither goest thou, holy friar, upon  this hot summer's day?\"    \"I go a pilgrim to Canterbury Town,\" answered Will Stutely, speaking  gruffly, so that none might know his voice.    Then the constable said, for the third time, \"Now tell me, holy father,  do pilgrims to Canterbury wear good Lincoln green beneath their robes?  Ha!  By my faith, I take thee to be some lusty thief, and perhaps one of  Robin Hood's own band! Now, by Our Lady's grace, if thou movest hand or  foot, I will run thee through the body with my sword!\"    Then he flashed forth his bright sword and leaped upon Will Stutely,  thinking he would take him unaware; but Stutely had his own sword  tightly held in his hand, beneath his robe, so he drew it forth before  the constable came upon him.  Then the stout constable struck a mighty  blow; but he struck no more in all that fight, for Stutely, parrying the  blow right deftly, smote the constable back again with all his might.  Then he would have escaped, but could not, for the other, all dizzy with  the wound and with the flowing blood, seized him by the knees with his  arms even as he reeled and fell.  Then the others rushed upon him, and  Stutely struck again at another of the Sheriff's men, but the steel cap  glanced the blow, and though the blade bit deep, it did not kill.  Meanwhile, the constable, fainting as he was, drew Stutely downward, and  the others, seeing the yeoman hampered so, rushed upon him again, and  one smote him a blow upon the crown so that the blood ran down his face  and blinded him.  Then, staggering, he fell, and all sprang upon him,  though he struggled so manfully that they could hardly hold him fast.  Then they bound him with stout hempen cords so that he could not move  either hand or foot, and thus they overcame him.    Robin Hood stood under the greenwood tree, thinking of Will Stutely and  how he might be faring, when suddenly he saw two of his stout yeomen  come running down the forest path, and betwixt them ran buxom Maken of  the Blue Boar.  Then Robin's heart fell, for he knew they were the  bearers of ill tidings.    \"Will Stutely hath been taken,\" cried they, when they had come to where  he stood.    \"And is it thou that hast brought such doleful news?\" said Robin to the  lass.    \"Ay, marry, for I saw it all,\" cried she, panting as the hare pants when  it has escaped the hounds, \"and I fear he is wounded sore, for one smote  him main shrewdly i' the crown. They have bound him and taken him to  Nottingham Town, and ere I left the Blue Boar I heard that he should be  hanged tomorrow day.\"    \"He shall not be hanged tomorrow day,\" cried Robin; \"or, if he be, full  many a one shall gnaw the sod, and many shall have cause to cry Alack-a-  day!\"    Then he clapped his horn to his lips and blew three blasts right loudly,  and presently his good yeomen came running through the greenwood until  sevenscore bold blades were gathered around him.    \"Now hark you all!\" cried Robin.  \"Our dear companion Will Stutely hath  been taken by that vile Sheriff's men, therefore doth it behoove us to  take bow and brand in hand to bring him off again; for I wot that we  ought to risk life and limb for him, as he hath risked life and limb for  us.  Is it not so, my merry men all?\" Then all cried, \"Ay!\" with a great  voice.    So the next day they all wended their way from Sherwood Forest, but by  different paths, for it behooved them to be very crafty; so the band  separated into parties of twos and threes, which were all to meet again  in a tangled dell that lay near to Nottingham Town.  Then, when they had  all gathered together at the place of meeting, Robin spoke to them thus:    \"Now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news, for it doth  behoove us to be cunning and wary if we would bring our friend Will  Stutely off from the Sheriff's clutches.\"    So they lay hidden a long time, until the sun stood high in the sky. The  day was warm and the dusty road was bare of travelers, except an aged  palmer who walked slowly along the highroad that led close beside the  gray castle wall of Nottingham Town.  When Robin saw that no other  wayfarer was within sight, he called young David of Doncaster, who was a  shrewd man for his years, and said to him, \"Now get thee forth, young  David, and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall, for  he hath come but now from Nottingham Town, and may tell thee news of  good Stutely, perchance.\"    So David strode forth, and when he came up to the pilgrim, he saluted  him and said, \"Good morrow, holy father, and canst thou tell me when  Will Stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree? I fain would not miss  the sight, for I have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hanged.\"    \"Now, out upon thee, young man,\" cried the Palmer, \"that thou shouldst  speak so when a good stout man is to be hanged for nothing but guarding  his own life!\"  And he struck his staff upon the ground in anger.  \"Alas, say I, that this thing should be! For even this day, toward  evening, when the sun falleth low, he shall be hanged, fourscore rods  from the great town gate of Nottingham, where three roads meet; for  there the Sheriff sweareth he shall die as a warning to all outlaws in  Nottinghamshire.  But yet, I say again, Alas!  For, though Robin Hood  and his band may be outlaws, yet he taketh only from the rich and the  strong and the dishonest man, while there is not a poor widow nor a  peasant with many children, nigh to Sherwood, but has barley flour  enough all the year long through him.  It grieves my heart to see one as  gallant as this Stutely die, for I have been a good Saxon yeoman in my  day, ere I turned palmer, and well I know a stout hand and one that  smiteth shrewdly at a cruel Norman or a proud abbot with fat moneybags.  Had good Stutely's master but known how his man was compassed about with  perils, perchance he might send succor to bring him out of the hand of  his enemies.    \"Ay, marry, that is true,\" cried the young man.  \"If Robin and his men  be nigh this place, I wot right well they will strive to bring him forth  from his peril.  But fare thee well, thou good old man, and believe me,  if Will Stutely die, he shall be right well avenged.\"    Then he turned and strode rapidly away; but the Palmer looked after him,  muttering, \"I wot that youth is no country hind that hath come to see a  good man die.  Well, well, perchance Robin Hood is not so far away but  that there will be stout doings this day.\" So he went upon his way,  muttering to himself.    When David of Doncaster told Robin Hood what the Palmer had said to him,  Robin called the band around him and spoke to them thus:    \"Now let us get straightway into Nottingham Town and mix ourselves with  the people there; but keep ye one another in sight, pressing as near the  prisoner and his guards as ye can, when they come outside the walls.  Strike no man without need, for I would fain avoid bloodshed, but if ye  do strike, strike hard, and see that there be no need to strike again.  Then keep all together until we come again to Sherwood, and let no man  leave his fellows.\"    The sun was low in the western sky when a bugle note sounded from the  castle wall.  Then all was bustle in Nottingham Town and crowds filled  the streets, for all knew that the famous Will Stutely was to be hanged  that day.  Presently the castle gates opened wide and a great array of  men-at-arms came forth with noise and clatter, the Sheriff, all clad in  shining mail of linked chain, riding at their head. In the midst of all  the guard, in a cart, with a halter about his neck, rode Will Stutely.  His face was pale with his wound and with loss of blood, like the moon  in broad daylight, and his fair hair was clotted in points upon his  forehead, where the blood had hardened. When he came forth from the  castle he looked up and he looked down, but though he saw some faces  that showed pity and some that showed friendliness, he saw none that he  knew.  Then his heart sank within him like a plummet of lead, but  nevertheless he spoke up boldly.    \"Give a sword into my hand, Sir Sheriff,\" said he, \"and wounded man  though I be, I will fight thee and all thy men till life and strength be  gone.\"    \"Nay, thou naughty varlet,\" quoth the Sheriff, turning his head and  looking right grimly upon Will Stutely, \"thou shalt have no sword but  shall die a mean death, as beseemeth a vile thief like thee.\"    \"Then do but untie my hands and I will fight thee and thy men with no  weapon but only my naked fists.  I crave no weapon, but let me not be  meanly hanged this"]]]
