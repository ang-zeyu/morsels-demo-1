Didn't I speak plain enough?\" asked the tramp, angrily.    \"Are you a thief, then?\"    \"Don't you dare to call me a thief!\" said the tramp, menacingly.    \"Then, if you are an honest man, why do you ask that question?\"    \"Because I am going to borrow what money you have.\"    \"Borrow!\"    \"Yes,\" said the man, with a grin. \"I'll hand it back when I come around  again.\"    Under ordinary circumstances there would not have been money enough in  the farmhouse to be anxious about, but it so happened that Farmer Cole  had sold a yoke of oxen, and the money received, a hundred dollars,  was upstairs in a bureau drawer. The thought of this, though she didn't  suppose the tramp to be aware of it, was enough to terrify Mrs. Cole,  and she sank back in the chair in a panic. Of course the tramp inferred  that there was a considerable sum in the house.    \"Come, hurry up!\" he said, roughly, \"I can't wait here all day. Where do  you keep the money?\"    \"It is my husband's,\" said Mrs. Cole, terrified out of all prudence.    \"All right! I'll pay it back to him. While you're about it, you may  collect all the spoons, too. I'm going to open a boarding house,\" he  continued, with a chuckle, \"and I shall need them.\"    \"Oh, heavens! What shall I do?\" ejaculated the frightened woman.          CHAPTER X. AN EXCITING SCENE.        \"You'd better go upstairs and get that money, or I will go up myself,\"  said the tramp, boldly.    \"I will go,\" said Mrs. Cole, terrified.    It was at this time that Tom Tripp, looking in at the window, got an  idea of the situation, but he was unobserved. The river bank was near,  and he ran down to it, hoping, but not expecting, to see some one who  could interfere with the impudent robber. We have already seen that he  was luckier than he anticipated.    Meanwhile Mrs. Cole went upstairs, not knowing how to save the money  from being carried away. She wished heartily that her husband had taken  it with him. One hundred dollars, as she well knew, would be a serious  loss to her husband, who was only moderately well to do. She thought  it possible that the tramp might know how large a sum there was in the  house, but could not be sure. She resolved, however, to make an effort  to save the larger part of the money. From the wallet she took two  five-dollar bills, and then, removing it from the drawer, put it between  the beds. She lingered as long as she dared, and then went downstairs  with the two bills in her hand.    \"Well, have you got the money?\" growled the tramp.    \"Don't take it,\" she said; \"be satisfied with the breakfast I have given  you.\"    \"You're a fool!\" said the tramp, rudely. \"How much have you got there?\"    \"Ten dollars.\"    \"Ten dollars!\" said the tramp, disdainfully. \"What do you take me for?\"    \"It is a large sum of money to me and my husband, sir,\" said the poor  woman, nervously.    \"It isn't enough for me! You have got more money in the house. Don't lie  to me! You know you have.\"    \"I am not used to be talked to in that way,\" said Mrs. Cole, forgetting  her timidity for the moment.    \"I can't help what you are used to; you'd better not trifle with me. Go  upstairs and bring down the rest of the money--do you hear?\"    \"Oh, sir!\"    \"'Oh, sir!'\" repeated the tramp, impatiently. \"I can't stay here all  day. Are you going to do as I tell you?\"    \"I suppose I must,\" said the poor woman.    \"That's sensible. You'll find out after a while that nothing is to be  gained by trying to fool me. I'll give you just three minutes to find  that money and bring it down.\"    \"You'll leave the spoons, then?\"    \"No; I want them, as I've already told you. Come, two minutes are  passed. I don't want to kill you, but--\"    Mrs. Cole uttered a shriek of dismay, and turned to obey the command  of her unwelcome visitor, when a loud, clear voice was heard from just  outside the window.    \"Stay where you are, Mrs. Cole! There is help at hand. This ruffian  shall not harm you.\"    It was the voice of George Melville. The tramp turned swiftly and stared  in ill-disguised dismay at Melville and Herbert.    \"What business is it of yours?\" he demanded, in a blustering tone.    \"We make it our business to defend this lady from your thievish  designs,\" said Melville.    \"You!\" exclaimed the tramp, contemptuously. \"Why, I could twist either  of you round my little finger.\"    \"You'd better not try it!\" said Melville, not showing the least  trepidation. \"Mrs. Cole, has this man anything of yours in his  possession?\"    \"He has my spoons and I have just handed him ten dollars.\"    George Melville turned to the tramp.    \"Be kind enough to lay the spoons on the table,\" he said, \"and give back  the ten dollars Mrs. Cole handed you.\"    \"You must think I'm a fool!\" said the tramp.    \"No; but I think you are a prudent man. If you do as I say we will let  you go; if not--\"    \"Well, if not?\" blustered the tramp.    \"If not, you may regret it.\"    All this time George Melville had spoken in his usual tone of voice, and  the tramp was puzzled to know whether he had any weapon with him. For  himself, he was unarmed, and this made him feel rather ill at ease,  notwithstanding his superiority in physical strength. He was rather  disposed to think that George Melville had a pistol, for he could not  understand how otherwise he should dare to confront a man of twice his  size and strength.    \"I don't care for the spoons,\" he said, \"but I will take the money.\"    \"No, you will return the money,\" said Melville, calmly.    \"Who will make me?\" demanded the tramp, defiantly.    \"I will.\"    \"We'll see about that!\" said the tramp, desperately, and he sprang  towards Melville, who had in the meantime entered the house and stood  only six feet distant.    \"Stay where you are!\" exclaimed Melville, resolutely, and he drew a  pistol, which he leveled at his formidable antagonist.    \"That settles it, stranger!\" said the tramp, \"You've got the advantage  of me this time. Just wait till we meet again.\"    \"I am willing to wait for some time,\" said Melville, shrugging his  shoulders. \"I have no desire to cultivate your acquaintance, my friend.\"    \"There are the spoons!\" said the tramp, throwing them down on the table.    \"Now for the money!\"    The tramp looked at George Melville. Melville still held the pistol in  his hand leveled at his breast. The thief was a large man, but he was  not a brave one. He cowered before the resolute glance of his small  opponent.    \"Won't you interfere with me if I give back the money?\" he asked.    \"No.\"    \"Will you let me go without firing at me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Perhaps you won't keep your agreement,\" suggested the tramp, nervously.    \"I am a man of my word,\" said Melville, calmly.    His calm, resolute tone, free from all excitement, impressed the tramp  with confidence. He drew the notes from his vest pocket, where he had  thrust them, and threw them on the table.    \"Now, may I go?\" he said.    In answer, George Melville, who stood between him and the door, drew  aside, still, however, holding the pistol in position, and the tramp  passed out, not sorry, it may be said, to get out of range of the  weapon.    They watched him striding through the yard, and when he was fairly gone  Mrs. Cole said:    \"Oh, how can I thank you for saving me from this wretch?\"    \"I am glad to have been the instrument of deliverance,\" said Melville,  politely.    \"It was fortunate you had the pistol with you, Mr. Melville,\" said  Herbert.    \"Well, yes, perhaps it was,\" said Melville, smiling.    \"Pray, put it up, Mr. Melville,\" said the farmer's wife, \"it always  makes me nervous to see a loaded pistol.\"    Melville bowed, and put back the pistol in his pocket.    \"As your unpleasant visitor has gone,\" he said, \"I may as well relieve  your fears by saying that the pistol is not loaded.\"    \"Not loaded!\" exclaimed Herbert and Tom Tripp in concert.    \"No; it has not been loaded to my knowledge for a year.\"    \"Then how could you stand up against that man?\" asked the farmer's wife,  in wonder.    \"He thought it was loaded!\" replied Melville, \"and that answered the  purpose. I should be very reluctant to use a loaded pistol, for I have  a high idea of the sacredness of human life, but I have no objection to  playing upon the fears of a man like that.\"    Melville and Herbert remained at the farmhouse for half an hour, till  the return of the farmer, when they resumed their river trip. They  returned about noon. When they were walking through the main street,  Herbert saw the town constable approaching with the air of a man who had  business with him.    \"Did you wish to speak to me, Mr. Bruce?\" he asked.    \"Yes, Herbert. I have a warrant for your arrest.\"    \"For my arrest!\" exclaimed Herbert, in amazement. \"What for?\"    \"On complaint of Eben Graham, for abstracting postage stamps and money  from the post office last evening.\"          CHAPTER XI. TRIED FOR THEFT.        Herbert stared at the constable in blank amazement.    \"I am charged with stealing stamps and money from the post office?\" he  said.    \"Yes.\"    \"Who makes the charge?\" demanded Herbert, in great excitement.    \"Eben Graham.\"    \"I don't know what it means,\" said our hero, turning to George Melville.    \"It means,\" said Melville, \"that the fellow is envious of you, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1," New York,  produced 16 dollars per bushel. All the old residents in the  Gaboon know the story of the gold dust. The prospector was the  late Captain Richard E. Lawlin, of New York, who was employed by  Messrs. Bishop of Philadelphia, the same house that commissioned  the chasseur de gorilles to collect \"rubber\" for them, and who  was so eminently useful to the young French traveller that the  scant notice of his name is considered curious.    Great would be my wonder if the West African as well as the East  African Ghats did not prove auriferous; both fulfil all the  required conditions, and both await actual discovery. The  Mountains of the Moon, so frequently mentioned by M. du Chaillu  and the Gaboon Mission, are doubtless the versants between the  valleys of the Niger and the Congo. Lately Dr. Schweinfurth found  an equatorial range which, stretching northwards towards the Bahr  el Ghazal, was seen to trend westward. According to Mr. Consul  Hutchinson (\"Ten Years' Wanderings among the Ethiopians,\" p.  250), the Rev. Messrs. Mackey and Clemens, of the Corisco Mission  \"explored more than a hundred miles of country across the Sierra  del Crystal Range of Mountains\" --I am inclined to believe that a  hundred miles from the coast was their furthest point. We shall  presently travel towards this mysterious range, and there is no  difficulty in passing it, except the utter want of a commercial  road, and the wildness of tribes that have never sighted a  traveller nor a civilized man.    The rivers of our region are of three kinds; little surface  drains principally in the north; broad estuaries like the Mersey  and many streams of Eastern Scotland in the central parts, and a  single bed, the Ogobe, breaking through the subtending Ghats, and  forming a huge lagoon-delta. Beginning at Camarones are the Boroa  and Borba Waters, with the Rio de Campo, fifteen leagues further  south; of these little is known, except that they fall into the  Bight of Panari or Pannaria.    According to Barbot (iv. 9), the English charts give the name of  Point Pan to a large deep bight in which lies the harbour-bay  \"Porto de Garapo\" (Garápa, sugar-cane juice?); and he calls the  two rounded hillocks, extending inland from Point Pan to the  northern banks of the Rio de Campo, \"Navia.\" The un-African word  Panari or Pannaria is probably a corruption of Páo de Nao, the  bay north of Garapo, and \"Navia.\"    These small features are followed by the Rio de São Bento,  improperly called in our charts the St. Benito, Bonito, Bonita,  and Boneto; the native name is Lobei, and it traverses the Kombi  country, --such is the extent of our information. The next is the  well-known Muni, the Ntambounay of M. du Chaillu, generally  called the Danger River, in old charts \"Rio de São João,\" and  \"Rio da Angra\" (of the bight); an estuary which, like most of its  kind, bifurcates above, and, receiving a number of little  tributaries from the Sierra, forms a broad bed and empties itself  through a mass of mangroves into the innermost north-eastern  corner of Corisco Bay. This sag in the coast is formed by Ninje  (Nenge the island?), or the Cabo de São João (Cape St. John) to  the north, fronted south by a large square-headed block of land,  whose point is called Cabo das Esteiras--of matting (Barbot's  Estyras), an article of trade in the olden time. The southern  part receives the Munda (Moondah) river, a foul and unimportant  stream, which has been occupied by the American missionaries.    We shall ascend the Gaboon estuary to its sources. South of it, a  number of sweet little water-courses break the shore-line as far  as the Nazareth River, which debouches north of Urungu, or Cape  Lopez (Cabo de Lopo Gonsalvez), and which forms by anastomosing  with a southern river the Ogobe (Ogowai of M. du Chaillu), a  complicated delta whose sea-front extends from north to south, at  least eighty miles. Beyond Cape Lopez is an outfall, known to  Europeans as the Rio Mexias: it is apparently a mesh in the net-  work of the Nazareth-Ogobe. The same may be said of the Rio  Fernão Vaz, about 110 miles south of the Gaboon, and of yet  another stream which, running lagoon-like some forty miles along  the shore, has received in our maps the somewhat vague name of R.  Rembo or River River. Orembo (Simpongwe) being the generic term  for a stream or river, is applied emphatically to the Nkomo  branch of the Gaboon, and to the Fernão Vaz.    The Ogobe is the only river between the Niger and the Congo which  escapes, through favouring depressions, from the highlands  flanking the great watery plateau of Inner Africa. By its plainly  marked double seasons of flood at the equinoxes, and by the time  of its low water, we prove that it drains the belt of calms, and  the region immediately upon the equator. The explorations of  Lieutenant Serval and others, in \"Le Pionnier\" river-steamer,  give it an average breadth of 8,200 feet, though broken by sand-  banks and islands; the depth in the main channel, which at times  is narrow and difficult to find, averages between sixteen and  forty-eight feet; and, in the dry season of 1862, the vessel ran  up sixty English miles.    Before M. du Chaillu's expeditions, \"the rivers known to  Europeans,\" he tells us in his Preface (\"First Journey,\" p. iv.),  \"as the Nazareth, Mexias, and Fernam Vaz, were supposed to be  three distinct streams.\" In 1817 Bowdich identified the \"Ogoowai\"  with the Congo, and the Rev. Mr. Wilson (p. 284) shows us the  small amount of knowledge that existed even amongst experts, five  years before the \"Gorilla book\" appeared. \"From Cape Lopez, where  the Nazareth debouches, there is a narrow lagoon running along  the sea-coast, and very near to it, all the way to Mayumba. This  lagoon is much traversed by boats and canoes, and, when the  slave-trade was in vigorous operation, it afforded the Portuguese  traders great facilities for eluding the vigilance of British  cruizers, by shifting their slaves from point to point, and  embarking them, according to a preconcerted plan.\"    M. du Chaillu first proved that the Ogobe was formed by two  forks, the northern, or Rembo Okanda, and the southern, or Rembo  Nguye. The former is the more important. Mr. R.S.N. Walker found  this stream above the confluence to be from 1,800 to 2,100 feet  wide, though half the bed was occupied by bare sand-banks. Higher  up, where rocks and rapids interfered with the boat-voyage, the  current was considerable, but the breadth diminished to 600 feet.  The southern branch (also written Ngunië) was found in Apono Land  (S. lat. 2°), about the breadth of the Thames at London Bridge,  700 feet. In June the depth was ten to fifteen feet, to which the  rainy season added ten.    M. du Chaillu also established the facts that the Nazareth river  was the northern arm of the Delta, and that the Fernão Vaz  anastomosed with the Delta's southern arm.    The only pelagic islands off the Gaboon coast are the Brancas,  Great and Little; Corisco Island, which we shall presently visit;  Great and Little Elobi, called by old travellers Mosquito  Islands, probably for \"Moucheron,\" a Dutchman who lost his ship  there in 1600. The land about the mouths of the Ogobe is a mass  of mangrove swamps, like the Nigerian Delta, which high tides  convert into insular ground; these, however, must be considered  terra firma in its infancy. The riverine islands of the Gaboon  proper will be noticed as we ascend the bed.    Pongo-land ignores all such artificial partitions as districts or  parishes; the only divisions are the countries occupied by the  several tribes.    The Gaboon lies in \"Africa-on-the-Line,\" and a description of the  year at Zanzibar Island applies to it in many points.[FN#6] The  characteristic of this equatorial belt is uniformity of  temperature: whilst the Arabian and the Australian deserts often  show a variation of 50° Fahr. in a single day, the yearly range  of the mercury at Singapore is about 10°. The four seasons of the  temperates are utterly unknown to the heart of the tropics--even  in Hindostan the poet who would sing, for instance, the charms of  spring must borrow the latter word (Buhar) from the Persian. If  the \"bull\" be allowed, the only rule here appears to be one of  exceptions. The traveller is always assured that this time there  have been no rains, or no dries, or no tornadoes, or one or all  in excess, till at last he comes to the conclusion that the Clerk  of the Weather must have mislaid his ledger. Contrary to the  popular idea, which has descended to us from the classics, the  climate under the Line is not of that torrid heat which a  vertical sun suggests; the burning zone of the Old World begins  in the northern hemisphere, where the regular rains do not  extend, beyond the tenth as far as the twenty-fifth degree. The  equatorial climate is essentially temperate: for instance, the  heat of Sumatra, lying almost under the Line, rarely exceeds 24°  R.= 86° Fahr. In the Gaboon the thermometer ranges from 65° to  90° Fahr., \"a degree of heat,\" says Dr. Ford, \"less than in many  salubrious localities in other parts of the world.\"    Upon the Gaboon the wet seasons are synchronous with the vertical  suns at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. \"The rainy season of a  place within the tropics always begins when the sun has reached  the zenith of that place. Then the tradewinds, blowing regularly  at other seasons, become gradually weaker, and at length cease  and give way to variable winds and calms. The trade-wind no  longer brings its regular supply of cooler, drier air; the rising  heats and calms favour an ascending current\" (in the sea-depths,  I may add, as well as on land), \"which bears the damp air into  the upper regions of the atmosphere, there to be cooled, and to  occasion the heavy down-pour of each afternoon. The nights and  mornings are for the most part bright and clear. When the sun  moves away from the zenith,"]]]
