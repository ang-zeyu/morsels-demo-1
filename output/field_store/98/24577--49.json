Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring  the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee.\"    But I said:    \"That a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing;  but it were dishonor to the _king_ if any that saw his minister naked  should not also see him delivered from his shame.  If I might ask  that my clothes be brought again--\"    \"They are not meet,\" the king broke in.  \"Fetch raiment of another  sort; clothe him like a prince!\"    My idea worked.  I wanted to keep things as they were till the  eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get  me to dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn't do it.  Sending  for the clothes gained some delay, but not enough.  So I had to make  another excuse.  I said it would be but natural if the king should  change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done  under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while,  and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind  the same, the darkness should be dismissed.  Neither the king nor  anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but I had  to stick to my point.    It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while I struggled  with those awkward sixth-century clothes.  It got to be pitch dark,  at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold  uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars  come out and twinkle in the sky.  At last the eclipse was total,  and I was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which  was quite natural. I said:    \"The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms.\"  Then  I lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then I said, with  the most awful solemnity: \"Let the enchantment dissolve and  pass harmless away!\"    There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and  that graveyard hush.  But when the silver rim of the sun pushed  itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with  a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me  with blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of  the wash, to be sure."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7245"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 4. (#8)"],[1,"of the  English wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century  were sprung here and there and yonder along the line, and compelled  the delightedest applause; and sometimes when a bright remark was  made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward  the other, you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling  spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along;  and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake.    Sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage, and she posted  me.  She said:    \"They journey to the Valley of Holiness, for to be blessed of the  godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed  from sin.\"    \"Where is this watering place?\"    \"It lieth a two-day journey hence, by the borders of the land that  hight the Cuckoo Kingdom.\"    \"Tell me about it.  Is it a celebrated place?\"    \"Oh, of a truth, yes.  There be none more so.  Of old time there  lived there an abbot and his monks.  Belike were none in the world  more holy than these; for they gave themselves to study of pious  books, and spoke not the one to the other, or indeed to any, and  ate decayed herbs and naught thereto, and slept hard, and prayed  much, and washed never; also they wore the same garment until it  fell from their bodies through age and decay.  Right so came they  to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities,  and visited by rich and poor, and reverenced.\"    \"Proceed.\"    \"But always there was lack of water there.  Whereas, upon a time,  the holy abbot prayed, and for answer a great stream of clear  water burst forth by miracle in a desert place.  Now were the  fickle monks tempted of the Fiend, and they wrought with their  abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct  a bath; and when he was become aweary and might not resist more,  he said have ye your will, then, and granted that they asked.  Now mark thou what 'tis to forsake the ways of purity the which  He loveth, and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense.  These monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as  white as snow; and lo, in that moment His sign appeared, in  miraculous rebuke! for His insulted waters ceased to flow, and  utterly vanished away.\"    \"They fared mildly, Sandy, considering how that kind of crime  is regarded in this country.\"    \"Belike; but it was their first sin; and they had been of perfect  life for long, and differing in naught from the angels.  Prayers,  tears, torturings of the flesh, all was vain to beguile that water  to flow again.  Even processions; even burnt-offerings; even votive  candles to the Virgin, did fail every each of them; and all in  the land did marvel.\"    \"How odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics,  and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero,  and everything come to a standstill.  Go on, Sandy.\"    \"And so upon a time, after year and day, the good abbot made humble  surrender and destroyed the bath.  And behold, His anger was in that  moment appeased, and the waters gushed richly forth again, and even  unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure.\"    \"Then I take it nobody has washed since.\"    \"He that would essay it could have his halter free; yes, and  swiftly would he need it, too.\"    \"The community has prospered since?\"    \"Even from that very day.  The fame of the miracle went abroad  into all lands.  From every land came monks to join; they came  even as the fishes come, in shoals; and the monastery added building  to building, and yet others to these, and so spread wide its arms  and took them in.  And nuns came, also; and more again, and yet  more; and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the  vale, and added building to building, until mighty was that nunnery.  And these were friendly unto those, and they joined their loving  labors together, and together they built a fair great foundling  asylum midway of the valley between.\"    \"You spoke of some hermits, Sandy.\"    \"These have gathered there from the ends of the earth.  A hermit  thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims.  Ye shall not  find no hermit of no sort wanting.  If any shall mention a hermit  of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far  strange land, let him but scratch among the holes and caves and  swamps that line that Valley of Holiness, and whatsoever be his  breed, it skills not, he shall find a sample of it there.\"    I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored  face, purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further  crumbs of fact; but I had hardly more than scraped acquaintance  with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up, in the  immemorial way, to that same old anecdote--the one Sir Dinadan  told me, what time I got into trouble with Sir Sagramor and was  challenged of him on account of it.  I excused myself and dropped  to the rear of the procession, sad at heart, willing to go hence  from this troubled life, this vale of tears, this brief day of  broken rest, of cloud and storm, of weary struggle and monotonous  defeat; and yet shrinking from the change, as remembering how long  eternity is, and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote.    Early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims;  but in this one was no merriment, no jokes, no laughter, no playful  ways, nor any happy giddiness, whether of youth or age.  Yet both  were here, both age and youth; gray old men and women, strong men  and women of middle age, young husbands, young wives, little boys  and girls, and three babies at the breast.  Even the children were  smileless; there was not a face among all these half a hundred  people but was cast down, and bore that set expression of hopelessness  which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with  despair.  They were slaves.  Chains led from their fettered feet  and their manacled hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists;  and all except the children were also linked together in a file  six feet apart, by a single chain which led from collar to collar  all down the line.  They were on foot, and had tramped three  hundred miles in eighteen days, upon the cheapest odds and ends  of food, and stingy rations of that.  They had slept in these  chains every night, bundled together like swine.  They had upon  their bodies some poor rags, but they could not be said to be  clothed.  Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and  made sores which were ulcerated and wormy.  Their naked feet were  torn, and none walked without a limp.  Originally there had been a  hundred of these unfortunates, but about half had been sold on  the trip.  The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried  a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into  several knotted tails at the end.  With this whip he cut the  shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain, and  straightened them up.  He did not speak; the whip conveyed his  desire without that.  None of these poor creatures looked up as  we rode along by; they showed no consciousness of our presence.  And they made no sound but one; that was the dull and awful clank  of their chains from end to end of the long file, as forty-three  burdened feet rose and fell in unison.  The file moved in a cloud  of its own making.    All these faces were gray with a coating of dust.  One has seen  the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses, and  has written his idle thought in it with his finger.  I was reminded  of this when I noticed the faces of some of those women, young  mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom, how  a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their  faces, plain to see, and lord, how plain to read! for it was the  track of tears.  One of these young mothers was but a girl, and  it hurt me to the heart to read that writing, and reflect that it  was come up out of the breast of such a child, a breast that ought  not to know trouble yet, but only the gladness of the morning of  life; and no doubt--    She reeled just then, giddy with fatigue, and down came the lash  and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder.  It stung me  as if I had been hit instead.  The master halted the file and  jumped from his horse.  He stormed and swore at this girl, and  said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness, and as this  was the last chance he should have, he would settle the account now.  She dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg,  and cry, and implore, in a passion of terror, but the master gave  no attention.  He snatched the child from her, and then made the  men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on  the ground and hold her there and expose her body; and then he  laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed, she  shrieking and struggling the while piteously.  One of the men who  was holding her turned away his face, and for this humanity he was  reviled and flogged.    All our pilgrims looked on and commented--on the expert way in  which the whip was handled.  They were too much hardened by lifelong  everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything  else in the exhibition that invited comment.  This was what slavery  could do, in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior  lobe of human feeling; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people,  and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that.    I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free, but that  would not do.  I must not interfere too much and get myself a name  for riding over the country's laws and the citizen's rights  roughshod.  If I lived and prospered I would be the death of  slavery, that I was resolved upon; but I would try to fix it so  that when I became its executioner it should be by "]]]
