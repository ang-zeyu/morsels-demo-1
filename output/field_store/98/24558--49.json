Always keep going on.  Never give in. You know what Shakespeare says about the one who first  cries, 'Hold, enough!' Do you read Shakespeare, sir?\"    \"Yes,\" said Sheen.    \"Ah, now _he_ knew his business,\" said Mr Bevan enthusiastically.  \"_There_ was ring-craft, as you may say. _He_ wasn't a novice.\"    Sheen agreed that Shakespeare had written some good things in his time.    \"That's what you want to remember. Always keep going on, as the saying  is. I was fighting Dick Roberts at the National--an American, he was,  from San Francisco. He come at me with his right stretched out, and I  think he's going to hit me with it, when blessed if his left don't come  out instead, and, my Golly! it nearly knocked a passage through me.  Just where that fellow hit you, sir, he hit me. It was just at the end  of the round, and I went back to my corner. Jim Blake was seconding me.  'What's this, Jim?' I says, 'is the man mad, or what?' 'Why,' he says,  'he's left-handed, that's what's the matter. Get on top of him.' 'Get  on top of him? I says. 'My Golly, I'll get on top of the roof if he's  going to hit me another of those.' But I kept on, and got close to him,  and he couldn't get in another of them, and he give in after the  seventh round.\"    \"What competition was that?\" asked Sheen.    Mr Bevan laughed. \"It was a twenty-round contest, sir, for seven-fifty  aside and the Light Weight Championship of the World.\"    Sheen looked at him in astonishment. He had always imagined  professional pugilists to be bullet-headed and beetle-browed to a man.  He was not prepared for one of Mr Joe Bevan's description. For all the  marks of his profession that he bore on his face, in the shape of lumps  and scars, he might have been a curate. His face looked tough, and his  eyes harboured always a curiously alert, questioning expression, as if  he were perpetually \"sizing up\" the person he was addressing. But  otherwise he was like other men. He seemed also to have a pretty taste  in Literature. This, combined with his strong and capable air,  attracted Sheen. Usually he was shy and ill at ease with strangers. Joe  Bevan he felt he had known all his life.    \"Do you still fight?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said Mr Bevan, \"I gave it up. A man finds he's getting on, as the  saying is, and it don't do to keep at it too long. I teach and I train,  but I don't fight now.\"    A sudden idea flashed across Sheen's mind. He was still glowing with  that pride which those who are accustomed to work with their brains  feel when they have gone honestly through some labour of the hands. At  that moment he felt himself capable of fighting the world and beating  it. The small point, that Albert had knocked him out of time in less  than a minute, did not damp him at all. He had started on the right  road. He had done something. He had stood up to his man till he could  stand no longer. An unlimited vista of action stretched before him. He  had tasted the pleasure of the fight, and he wanted more.    Why, he thought, should he not avail himself of Joe Bevan's services to  help him put himself right in the eyes of the house? At the end of the  term, shortly before the Public Schools' Competitions at Aldershot,  inter-house boxing cups were competed for at Wrykyn. It would be a  dramatic act of reparation to the house if he could win the  Light-Weight cup for it. His imagination, jumping wide gaps, did not  admit the possibility of his not being good enough to win it. In the  scene which he conjured up in his mind he was an easy victor. After  all, there was the greater part of the term to learn in, and he would  have a Champion of the World to teach him.    Mr Bevan cut in on his reflections as if he had heard them by some  process of wireless telegraphy.    \"Now, look here, sir,\" he said, \"you should let me give you a few  lessons. You're plucky, but you don't know the game as yet. And  boxing's a thing every one ought to know. Supposition is, you're  crossing a field or going down a street with your sweetheart or your  wife--\"    Sheen was neither engaged nor married, but he let the point pass.    --\"And up comes one of these hooligans, as they call 'em. What are you  going to do if he starts his games? Why, nothing, if you can't box. You  may be plucky, but you can't beat him. And if you beat him, you'll get  half murdered yourself. What you want to do is to learn to box, and  then what happens? Why, as soon as he sees you shaping, he says to  himself, 'Hullo, this chap knows too much for me. I'm off,' and off he  runs. Or supposition is, he comes for you. You don't mind. Not you. You  give him one punch in the right place, and then you go off to your tea,  leaving him lying there. He won't get up.\"    \"I'd like to learn,\" said Sheen. \"I should be awfully obliged if you'd  teach me. I wonder if you could make me any good by the end of the  term. The House Competitions come off then.\"    \"That all depends, sir. It comes easier to some than others. If you  know how to shoot your left out straight, that's as good as six months'  teaching. After that it's all ring-craft. The straight left beats the  world.\"    \"Where shall I find you?\"    \"I'm training a young chap--eight stone seven, and he's got to get down  to eight stone four, for a bantam weight match--at an inn up the river  here. I daresay you know it, sir. Or any one would tell you where it  is. The 'Blue Boar,' it's called. You come there any time you like to  name, sir, and you'll find me.\"    \"I should like to come every day,\" said Sheen. \"Would that be too  often?\"    \"Oftener the better, sir. You can't practise too much.\"    \"Then I'll start next week. Thanks very much. By the way, I shall have  to go by boat, I suppose. It isn't far, is it? I've not been up the  river for some time. The School generally goes down stream.\"    \"It's not what you'd call far,\" said Bevan. \"But it would be easier for  you to come by road.\"    \"I haven't a bicycle.\"    \"Wouldn't one of your friends lend you one?\"    Sheen flushed.    \"No, I'd better come by boat, I think. I'll turn up on Tuesday at about  five. Will that suit you?\"    \"Yes, sir. That will be a good time. Then I'll say good bye, sir, for  the present.\"    Sheen went back to his house in a different mood from the one in which  he had left it. He did not care now when the other Seymourites looked  through him.    In the passage he met Linton, and grinned pleasantly at him.    \"What the dickens was that man grinning at?\" said Linton to himself. \"I  must have a smut or something on my face.\"    But a close inspection in the dormitory looking-glass revealed no  blemish on his handsome features.          VIII    A NAVAL BATTLE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES      What a go is life!    Let us examine the case of Jackson, of Dexter's. O'Hara, who had left  Dexter's at the end of the summer term, had once complained to Clowes  of the manner in which his house-master treated him, and Clowes had  remarked in his melancholy way that it was nothing less than a breach  of the law that Dexter should persist in leading a fellow a dog's life  without a dog licence for him.    That was precisely how Jackson felt on the subject.    Things became definitely unbearable on the day after Sheen's interview  with Mr Joe Bevan.    'Twas morn--to begin at the beginning--and Jackson sprang from his  little cot to embark on the labours of the day. Unfortunately, he  sprang ten minutes too late, and came down to breakfast about the time  of the second slice of bread and marmalade. Result, a hundred lines.  Proceeding to school, he had again fallen foul of his house-master--in  whose form he was--over a matter of unprepared Livy. As a matter of  fact, Jackson _had_ prepared the Livy. Or, rather, he had not  absolutely _prepared_ it; but he had meant to. But it was Mr  Templar's preparation, and Mr Templar was short-sighted. Any one will  understand, therefore, that it would have been simply chucking away the  gifts of Providence if he had not gone on with the novel which he had  been reading up till the last moment before prep-time, and had brought  along with him accidentally, as it were. It was a book called _A  Spoiler of Men_, by Richard Marsh, and there was a repulsive crime on  nearly every page. It was Hot Stuff. Much better than Livy....    Lunch Score--Two hundred lines.    During lunch he had the misfortune to upset a glass of water. Pure  accident, of course, but there it was, don't you know, all over the  table.    Mr Dexter had called him--        (a) clumsy;      (b) a pig;    and had given him        (1) Advice--\"You had better be careful, Jackson\".      (2) A present--\"Two hundred lines, Jackson\".    On the match being resumed at two o'clock, with four hundred lines on  the score-sheet, he had played a fine, free game during afternoon  school, and Mr Dexter, who objected to fine, free games--or, indeed,  any games--during school hours, had increased the total to six hundred,  when stumps were drawn for the day.    So on a bright sunny Saturday afternoon, when he should have been out  in the field cheering the house-team on to victory against the School  House, Jackson sat in the junior day-room at Dexter's copying out  portions of Virgil, Aeneid Two.    To him, later on in the afternoon, when he had finished half his task,  entered Painter, with the news that Dexter's had taken thirty points  off the School House just after half-time.    \"Mopped them up,\" said the terse and epigrammatic Painter. \"Made rings  round them. Haven't you finished yet? Well, chuck it, and come out.\"    \"What's on?\" asked Jackson.    \"We're going to have a boat race.\"    \"Pile it on.\"    \"We are, really. Fact. Some of these School House kids are awfully sick  about the match, and challenged us. That chap Tomlin thinks he can row.    \"He can't row for nuts,\" said Jackson. \"He doesn't know which end"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#8)"],[1,"to the land of great artists. The French  Government began to buy his work, and he began to receive commissions  to decorate walls in great buildings; thus, gradually, he made for  himself fame and fortune.    When this artist undertook to paint sacred subjects, of great dignity,  he was not at his best; but when he chose children and mothers and  everyday folk engaged about their everyday business, he painted  beautifully. Americans have bought many of his pictures and he has had  more popularity in this country than anywhere outside of France.    Some authorities give the birthplace of Bouguereau as La Rochelle; at  any rate he died there at midnight, on the nineteenth of August, 1905.      PLATE--THE VIRGIN AS CONSOLER    The main distinction about this artist's pictured faces is the  peculiarly earnest expression he has given to the eyes. In this  picture of the Virgin there is great genius in the pose and death-look  of the little child whose mother has flung herself across the lap of  Mary, abandoned to her agony. This painting is hung in the  Luxembourg. Others by the same master are called \"Psyche and Cupid\"  \"Birth of Venus,\" \"Innocence,\" and \"At the Well.\"          VII    SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES        _English (Pre-Raphaelite) School_    1833-1898    _Pupil of Rossetti_    This artist has been called the most original of all contemporaneous  artists. He has also been called the \"lyric painter\"; meaning that he  is to painting what the lyric poet is to literature. His work once  known can almost always be recognised wherever seen afterward. He did  not slavishly follow the Pre-Raphaelite school, yet he drew most of  his ideas from its methods. He was, in the use of stiff lines, a  follower of Botticelli, and not original in that detail, as some have  seemed to think.      PLATE--CHANT D'AMOUR    _(The Love-Song)_    This is a picture in the true Burne-Jones style: a beautiful woman in  billowy draperies, playing upon a harp forms the central figure of the  group of three--a listener on either side of her. There is the  attractiveness of the Burne-Jones method about this picture, but after  all there seems to be no very good reason for its having been  painted. The subject thus treated has only a negative value, and  little suggestion of thought or dramatic idea.    Another picture of this artist, in which his use of stiff draperies is  specially shown, is that of the women at the tomb of Christ, when they  find the stone rolled away and, looking around, see the Saviour's  figure before them. The scene is low and cavern-like, with a brilliant  light surrounding the tomb. This artist also painted \"The Vestal  Virgin,\" \"King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid,\" \"Pan and Psyche,\" \"The  Golden Stairs,\" and \"Love Among the Ruins.\"          VIII    JOHN CONSTABLE        _English School_    1776-1837    _Pupil of the Royal Academy_    John Constable was the son of a \"yeoman farmer\" who meant to make him  also a yeoman farmer. Mostly we find that the fathers of our artists  had no higher expectations for their sons than to have them take up  their own business; to begin as they had, and to end as they expected  to. But in John Constable's case, as with all the others, the father's  methods of living did not at all please the son, and having most of  all a liking for picture-making; young John set himself to planning  his own affairs.    Nevertheless, the foundation of John's art was laid right there in the  Suffolk farmer's home and conditions. He was born in East Bergholt,  and the father seems to have believed in windmills, for early in life  the signs of wind and weather became a part of the son's education. He  learned a deal more of atmospheric conditions there on his father's  windmill planted farm than he could possibly have learned shut up in a  studio, French fashion. As a little boy he came to know all the signs  of the heavens; the clouds gathering for storm or shine; the bending  of the trees in the blast; all of these he loved, and later on made  the principal subjects of his art. He learned to observe these things  as a matter of business and at his father's command; thus we may say  that he studied his life-work from his very infancy. All about him  were beautiful hedgerows, picturesque cottages with high pitched roofs  covered with thatch, and it was these beauties which bred one other  great landscape painter besides Constable, of whom we shall presently  speak, Gainsborough.    At last, graduating from windmills, John went to London. He had a  vacation from the work set him by his father, and for two years he  painted \"cottages, studied anatomy,\" and did the drudgery of his art;  but there was little money in it for him, and soon he had to go into  his father's counting house, for windmills seemed to have paid the  elder Constable, considerably better than painting promised to pay  young John.    John doubtless liked counting-house work even less than he had done  the study of windmills and weather in his father's fields. He was a  most persistent fellow, however, and finally he returned to London, to  study again the art he loved, this time in the Royal Academy, which  meant that he had made some progress.    His father gave him very little aid to do the things he longed to do,  but after his father's death he found that a little money was coming  to him from the estate--L4,000. He had already triumphed over his  difficulties by painting his first fine pictures; he now knew that he  was to become a successful artist, and be able to take care of himself  and a wife. Though in love, he had hitherto been too poor to  marry. His first splendid work was \"Dedham Vale.\"    Though things were going very well with him, it was not until Paris  discovered him that he achieved great success. In 1824 he painted two  large pictures which he took to Paris, and there he found fame. The  best landscape painting in France dates from the time when Constable's  works were hung in the Louvre, to become the delight of all  art-lovers.    He received a gold medal from Charles X., and became more honoured  abroad than he had ever been at home.    Constable had many enemies, and made many more after he became an  Academician. Some artists, who would have liked that honour and who  could not gain it for themselves, declared that Constable painted  \"with a palette knife,\" though it certainly would not have mattered if  he had, since he made great pictures.    He painted things exactly as he saw them, and was not a popular  artist. Most of all, he loved to paint the scenes that he had known so  well in his youth, and he did them over and over again, as if the  subject was one in which he wished to reach perfection.    When he died he left a picture, \"Arundel Castle and Mill,\" standing  with its paint wet upon his easel for he passed away very suddenly, on  April 1st, leaving behind him many unsold paintings.    He was a sensitive chap, and throughout his youth was greatly  distressed by the differences of opinion between himself and his  father. He was torn asunder between a sense of duty and his own wish  to be an artist; and his greatest consolation in this situation was in  the friendship he had formed for a plumber, who, like himself, dearly  loved art. The plumber's name was John Dunthorne, and the two men  wandered about the country, when not employed at their regular work,  and together, by streams and in fields, painted the same scenes. At  one time they hired a little room in the neighbouring village which  they made into a studio. Constable was a handsome fellow in his youth  and was known to all as the \"handsome miller.\" His father, the yeoman  farmer with the windmills, was also a miller.    In London he became acquainted with one John Smith, known as  \"Antiquity Smith,\" who taught him something of etching. After he was  recalled to his father's business, his mother wrote to \"Antiquity  Smith,\" that she hoped John \"would now attend to business, by which he  will please me and his father, and ensure his own respectability and  comfort\"--a complete expression of the middle-class British mind. Her  satisfaction was short-lived, for her son soon returned to London.    When his first pictures were rejected by the Royal Academy he showed  one of them to Sir Benjamin West, who said hopefully: \"Don't be  disheartened, young man, we shall hear of you again; you must have  loved nature very much before you could have painted this.\"    About that time he tried to paint many kinds of pictures, such as  portraits and sacred subjects, but he did not seem to succeed in  anything except the scenes of his boyhood, which he truly loved. Hence  he gave up attempting that which he could do only passably, and kept  to what he could do supremely well.    When his friends wished him to continue portrait painting, the only  thing that was well paid at that time, Constable wrote: \"You know I  have always succeeded best with my native scenes. They have always  charmed me, and I hope they always will. I have now a path marked out  very distinctly for myself, and I am desirous of pursuing it  uninterruptedly.\"    About the time he fell in love and before his father's death, his  health began to fail, and the young woman's mother would have none of  him. Her father was in favour of Constable, but he could not hold out  against the chance of his daughter losing her grandfather's fortune by  marrying the wrong man.    The lady was not so distractingly in love as young Constable was, and  she did not entirely like the idea of poverty, even with John, so she  held off, and with so much anxiety Constable became downright ill. For  five years the pair lived apart, and then the artist and the young  woman, whose name was Maria Bicknell, lost their mothers about the  same time, This drew them very closely together; and to help the  matter on, John's attendance upon his father in his last illness  brought him to the same town as Miss Bicknell."]]]
