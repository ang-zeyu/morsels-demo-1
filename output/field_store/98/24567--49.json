He eyed it sharply, but finding it quite impossible to see through  its sides, pulled out the cork and peered anxiously in. \"Can't see  nothin', but it's so dark in there I couldn't see if there was anything.  I've a great mind to break the hateful old thing.\"    He sat for awhile thinking how badly he wanted a pair of shoes to wear  to the Sunday School picnic. His mother had promised to wash and mend  his clothes, so that he might go looking very neat indeed; but the old  shoes were far past all mending and how could he go barefoot?    Then he began counting the chances of his father being very angry when  he should find his jug broken. He did not like the idea of getting a  whipping for it, as was very likely, but how could he resist the temptation  of making sure about those shoes? The more he thought of them, the more  he couldn't. He sprang up and hunted around until he found a good size  brick-bat, which he flung with such vigorous hand and correct aim that  the next moment the old jug lay in pieces before his eyes.    How eagerly he bent over them in the hope of finding not only what he  was so longing for but, perhaps, other treasure! But his poor little  heart sank as he turned over the fragments with trembling fingers. Nothing  could be found among the broken bits, wet on the inside with a bad-smelling  liquid.    Tim sat down again and sobbed as he had never sobbed before; so hard  that he did not hear a step beside him until a voice said:    \"Well, what's all this?\"    He sprang up in great alarm. It was his father, who always slept late  in the morning, and was very seldom awake so early as this.    [Illustration]    \"Who broke my jug?\" he asked. \"I did,\" said Tim, catching his breath  half in terror and half between his sobs.    \"Why did you?\" Tim looked up. The voice did not sound quite so terrible  as he had expected. The truth was his father had been touched at sight  of the forlorn figure, so very small and so sorrowful, which had bent  over the broken jug.    \"Why,\" he said, \"I was looking for a pair of new shoes. I want a pair  of shoes awful bad to wear at the picnic. All the other chaps wear shoes.\"    \"How came you to think you'd find shoes in a jug?\"    \"Why Mama said so. I asked her for some new shoes and she said they had  gone into the black jug, and that lots of other things had gone into it,  too--coats and hats, and bread and meat and things--and I thought if I  broke it I'd find them all, and there ain't a thing in it--and Mama never  said what wasn't so before--and I thought 'twould be so--sure.\"    And Tim, hardly able to sob out the words, feeling how keenly his trust  in mother's word had added to his great disappointment, sat down again,  and cried harder than ever.    His father seated himself on a box in the disorderly yard and remained  quiet for so long a time that Tim at last looked timidly up.    \"I am real sorry I broke your jug, Father. I'll never do it again.\"    \"No, I guess you won't,\" he said, laying a hand on the rough little head  as he went away leaving Tim overcome with astonishment that his father  had not been angry with him.    Two days after, on the very evening before the picnic, he handed Tim a  parcel, telling him to open it.    \"New shoes! new shoes!\" he shouted. \"Oh, Father, did you get a new jug  and were they in it?\"    \"No, my boy, there isn't going to be a new jug. Your mother was right  all the time--the things all went into the jug; but you see getting them  out is no easy matter so I am going to keep them out after this.\"    --_New York Observer_        LITTLE JENNIE'S SICKNESS AND DEATH    Little Jennie was eight years old, March 30, 1886. The April following  she was taken very sick, and from that time until June 4, she seemed a  little suffering angel. Then Jesus, who had so blessedly sustained her  during all her sufferings took her to Himself. She would say, when able  to talk: \"Mama, I do not care what I suffer, God knows best.\" When she  was very low, we would often see her dear lips moving, and listening,  hear her praying. She would finish her prayer and after saying \"Amen\"  having noticed that we were listening to her, would look up into our  faces to see if we wanted anything.    This patience and devotion characterized her whole life. Often, when she  was at play with her sister, who was the older by five years, when some  little trouble would arise, she would take her sister by the hand and  say: \"Kitty, let's tell Jesus.\" Then bowing her little head, she would  pour out her whole heart in prayer to God, with the fervency that is  shown by a true Christian.    About three weeks after she was taken ill her little body was paralyzed  and drawn all out of shape it seemed. Then in a few days her little limbs  were so we could almost straighten them. What suffering she endured all  that time, no one knows but those who were with her.    May 25th, which was Tuesday, while suffering terribly, she said: \"Mama,  play and sing.\" I took my guitar, and without stopping to think what to  sing, began that beautiful song in the Gospel Hymns: \"Nearer my home,  today, than I have been before.\" I could praise God just then, for I was  filled with His Spirit. She lay there looking at me with her little blue  eyes and trying in her weak voice to help me. At last she seemed soothed  by the music. But we knew that Jesus in his infinite love, had quieted  her for a time, because we were willing to submit to His will. We had  said all the time: \"Lord, not my will, but thine.\"    She rested quite well until about three o'clock in the afternoon; then  suddenly she spoke and her voice sounded quite strong. She said: \"Oh,  Mama see those people, how funny they look! They look like poles.\" She  was lying so that she could look out of the window and as she spoke her  eyes seemed to rest on some object there. Then she spoke louder; \"OH,  MAMMA, COME AND SEE THE LITTLE CHILDREN! I never saw so many in my life.\"    I sat down on the front of the bed and said: \"Jennie, is there any there  that you know?\"    She looked them over so earnestly, then said: \"No, not one.\" I asked her  how they looked. She said: \"Mama, every one has a gold crown on its head,  and they are all dressed in white.\" I thought that Jesus was coming for  her then. After telling me that there were none that she knew she sank  back on the pillows exhausted. But in a few moments she raised up again  and said: \"Oh, Mama, hear that music! Did you ever hear such grand music?  Now, do not shut the windows tonight, will you?\" I told her that I would  not.    The next morning she called Kittie into the room and said: \"Kittie, I  want to tell you what I saw last night.\" She then proceeded to tell her  the same as she had told me the evening before. Then she said: \"Now,  Kittie, you will forgive me for ever being cross to you won't you?\"    Kittie answered, \"Little darling, you have never been cross to me. Will  you forgive me, sister, for being cross to you?\"    \"Darling sister,\" she said, \"that is all right.\"    Thursday night she was paralyzed in her left side so that she had no use  of it. Friday all day she lay unconscious, and that night the same.  Saturday, about ten o'clock, she commenced to whisper. We could hear her  say: \"Papa, Mama.\" We tried to understand her, but at first could not.  She kept whispering plainer, and finally we heard her say: \"Take--me--  upstairs. I--want--to--lie--on--my--own--bed--once--more.\" But of course  we could not move her. Suddenly she said aloud: \"I am going to die! kiss  me quick, Mama.\"    I bent down and kissed her, and she looked so wretched. I said: \"Jennie,  you will not have to go alone; Jesus will take you.\"    She answered: \"I know it. I wish that He would come this minute. Kiss me  again, Mama.\"    I did so; then she wished us to sing. Again, without giving one thought,  I commenced singing the same words that I sang the Tuesday before. She  raised her right hand arm's length, and began to wave it and bow her  head. Oh! she was so happy. Then she said: \"Play.\" They brought the  guitar, and she continued to wave her little hand, while I played and  sang the whole piece. One of her aunts, standing near the bed took hold  of her hand to stop it, but it moved just the same; and I said: \"Ollie,  let go of her hand, that is the Lord's doings.\" After I finished, she  kissed her father, mother, and sister and bade them goodbye; then called  four other very dear friends and told them goodbye after kissing them.  She then called for a book and wanted the music teacher, who was present,  to play and sing a piece which she dearly loved.    Before she was sick she would have little prayer meetings, and her sweet  little face would shine with happiness. She would say: \"Oh, Mama, how  the Lord has blessed me.\"    [Illustration: \"They brought the guitar, and she continued to wave her  little hand, while I played and sang the whole piece.\"]    While the dear teacher was playing and singing her favorite she was  waving her little hand. We sang three or four other pieces around her  bed. We all thought that Jesus would take her then. Oh, what joy! it was  heaven below. Jesus was there and the room was filled with glory on  account of of His presence. Two of her aunts said that it seemed as  though they were in heaven.    She never spoke after that, but would try to make us understand by  motioning when she wanted anything. Sometimes it would take us a long  time, but she would be so patient. She was ready and waiting. She had  peace that the world cannot give, and, praise God! that the world cannot  take away. The dear little one lived until the next Tuesday afternoon,  and went to Jesus about three o'clock. That was the time she saw the  vision the Tuesday before. Tuesday morning before daylight she tried to  tell me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#8)"],[1,"before.\"    \"She did!\"    \"It amounted to the same thing. I had just been telling her how I did  the lake-hole today in two, and she said that in her opinion golf was a  game for children with water on the brain who weren't athletic enough  to play Animal Grab.\"    The two men shivered in sympathy.    \"There must be insanity in the family,\" said James at last.    \"That,\" said Peter, \"is the charitable explanation.\"    \"We were fortunate to find it out in time.\"    \"We were!\"    \"We mustn't run a risk like that again.\"    \"Never again!\"    \"I think we had better take up golf really seriously. It will keep us  out of mischief.\"    \"You're quite right. We ought to do our four rounds a day regularly.\"    \"In spring, summer, and autumn. And in winter it would be rash not to  practise most of the day at one of those indoor schools.\"    \"We ought to be safe that way.\"    \"Peter, old man,\" said James, \"I've been meaning to speak to you about  it for some time. I've got Sandy MacBean's new book, and I think you  ought to read it. It is full of helpful hints.\"    \"James!\"    \"Peter!\"    Silently the two men clasped hands. James Todd and Peter Willard were  themselves again.           *       *       *       *       *    And so (said the Oldest Member) we come back to our original  starting-point--to wit, that, while there is nothing to be said  definitely against love, your golfer should be extremely careful how he  indulges in it. It may improve his game or it may not. But, if he finds  that there is any danger that it may not--if the object of his  affections is not the kind of girl who will listen to him with cheerful  sympathy through the long evenings, while he tells her, illustrating  stance and grip and swing with the kitchen poker, each detail of the  day's round--then, I say unhesitatingly, he had better leave it alone.  Love has had a lot of press-agenting from the oldest times; but there  are higher, nobler things than love. A woman is only a woman, but a  hefty drive is a slosh.          3    _A Mixed Threesome_      It was the holiday season, and during the holidays the Greens  Committees have decided that the payment of twenty guineas shall  entitle fathers of families not only to infest the course themselves,  but also to decant their nearest and dearest upon it in whatever  quantity they please. All over the links, in consequence, happy,  laughing groups of children had broken out like a rash. A wan-faced  adult, who had been held up for ten minutes while a drove of issue  quarrelled over whether little Claude had taken two hundred or two  hundred and twenty approach shots to reach the ninth green sank into a  seat beside the Oldest Member.    \"What luck?\" inquired the Sage.    \"None to speak of,\" returned the other, moodily. \"I thought I had  bagged a small boy in a Lord Fauntleroy suit on the sixth, but he  ducked. These children make me tired. They should be bowling their  hoops in the road. Golf is a game for grownups. How can a fellow play,  with a platoon of progeny blocking him at every hole?\"    The Oldest Member shook his head. He could not subscribe to these  sentiments.    No doubt (said the Oldest Member) the summer golf-child is, from the  point of view of the player who likes to get round the course in a  single afternoon, something of a trial; but, personally, I confess, it  pleases me to see my fellow human beings--and into this category  golf-children, though at the moment you may not be broad-minded enough  to admit it, undoubtedly fall--taking to the noblest of games at an  early age. Golf, like measles, should be caught young, for, if  postponed to riper years, the results may be serious. Let me tell you  the story of Mortimer Sturgis, which illustrates what I mean rather  aptly.    Mortimer Sturgis, when I first knew him, was a care-free man of  thirty-eight, of amiable character and independent means, which he  increased from time to time by judicious ventures on the Stock  Exchange. Although he had never played golf, his had not been  altogether an ill-spent life. He swung a creditable racket at tennis,  was always ready to contribute a baritone solo to charity concerts, and  gave freely to the poor. He was what you might call a golden-mean man,  good-hearted rather than magnetic, with no serious vices and no heroic  virtues. For a hobby, he had taken up the collecting of porcelain  vases, and he was engaged to Betty Weston, a charming girl of  twenty-five, a lifelong friend of mine.    I like Mortimer. Everybody liked him. But, at the same time, I was a  little surprised that a girl like Betty should have become engaged to  him. As I said before, he was not magnetic; and magnetism, I thought,  was the chief quality she would have demanded in a man. Betty was one  of those ardent, vivid girls, with an intense capacity for  hero-worship, and I would have supposed that something more in the  nature of a plumed knight or a corsair of the deep would have been her  ideal. But, of course, if there is a branch of modern industry where  the demand is greater than the supply, it is the manufacture of knights  and corsairs; and nowadays a girl, however flaming her aspirations, has  to take the best she can get. I must admit that Betty seemed perfectly  content with Mortimer.    Such, then, was the state of affairs when Eddie Denton arrived, and the  trouble began.    I was escorting Betty home one evening after a tea-party at which we  had been fellow-guests, when, walking down the road, we happened to  espy Mortimer. He broke into a run when he saw us, and galloped up,  waving a piece of paper in his hand. He was plainly excited, a thing  which was unusual in this well-balanced man. His broad, good-humoured  face was working violently.    \"Good news!\" he cried. \"Good news! Dear old Eddie's back!\"    \"Oh, how nice for you, dear!\" said Betty. \"Eddie Denton is Mortimer's  best friend,\" she explained to me. \"He has told me so much about him. I  have been looking forward to his coming home. Mortie thinks the world  of him.\"    \"So will you, when you know him,\" cried Mortimer. \"Dear old Eddie! He's  a wonder! The best fellow on earth! We were at school and the 'Varsity  together. There's nobody like Eddie! He landed yesterday. Just home  from Central Africa. He's an explorer, you know,\" he said to me.  \"Spends all his time in places where it's death for a white man to go.\"    \"An explorer!\" I heard Betty breathe, as if to herself. I was not so  impressed, I fear, as she was. Explorers, as a matter of fact, leave me  a trifle cold. It has always seemed to me that the difficulties of  their life are greatly exaggerated--generally by themselves. In a large  country like Africa, for instance, I should imagine that it was almost  impossible for a man not to get somewhere if he goes on long enough.  Give _me_ the fellow who can plunge into the bowels of the earth  at Piccadilly Circus and find the right Tube train with nothing but a  lot of misleading signs to guide him. However, we are not all  constituted alike in this world, and it was apparent from the flush on  her cheek and the light in her eyes that Betty admired explorers.    \"I wired to him at once,\" went on Mortimer, \"and insisted on his coming  down here. It's two years since I saw him. You don't know how I have  looked forward, dear, to you and Eddie meeting. He is just your sort. I  know how romantic you are and keen on adventure and all that. Well,  you should hear Eddie tell the story of how he brought down the  bull _bongo_ with his last cartridge after all the _pongos_, or  native bearers, had fled into the _dongo_, or undergrowth.\"    \"I should love to!\" whispered Betty, her eyes glowing. I suppose to an  impressionable girl these things really are of absorbing interest. For  myself, _bongos_ intrigue me even less than _pongos_, while  _dongos_ frankly bore me. \"When do you expect him?\"    \"He will get my wire tonight. I'm hoping we shall see the dear old  fellow tomorrow afternoon some time. How surprised old Eddie will be to  hear that I'm engaged. He's such a confirmed bachelor himself. He told  me once that he considered the wisest thing ever said by human tongue  was the Swahili proverb--'Whoso taketh a woman into his kraal  depositeth himself straightway in the _wongo_.' _Wongo_, he  tells me, is a sort of broth composed of herbs and meat-bones,  corresponding to our soup. You must get Eddie to give it you in the  original Swahili. It sounds even better.\"    I saw the girl's eyes flash, and there came into her face that peculiar  set expression which married men know. It passed in an instant, but not  before it had given me material for thought which lasted me all the way  to my house and into the silent watches of the night. I was fond of  Mortimer Sturgis, and I could see trouble ahead for him as plainly as  though I had been a palmist reading his hand at two guineas a visit.  There are other proverbs fully as wise as the one which Mortimer had  translated from the Swahili, and one of the wisest is that quaint old  East London saying, handed down from one generation of costermongers to  another, and whispered at midnight in the wigwams of the whelk-seller!  \"Never introduce your donah to a pal.\" In those seven words is  contained the wisdom of the ages. I could read the future so plainly.  What but one thing could happen after Mortimer had influenced Betty's  imagination with his stories of his friend's romantic career, and added  the finishing touch by advertising him as a woman-hater? He might just  as well have asked for his ring back at once. My heart bled for  Mortimer.           *       *       *       *    I happened to call at his house on the second evening of the explorer's  visit, and already the mischief had been done.    Denton was one of those lean, hard-bitten men with smouldering eyes and  a brick-red complexion. He looked what he was, the man of action and  enterprise. He had the wiry frame and"]]]
