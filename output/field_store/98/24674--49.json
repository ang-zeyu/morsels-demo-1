The floor was  of marble, and the altar of Zeus which stood in the center of the court  was beautifully carved. The doorways which opened into the various rooms  of the house were hung with blue curtains. A room opening into the court  at the back had a hearth-fire in the middle of it, much like that in the  children's own home. Soon a door in the back of the house opened, and  Telesippe, the wife of Pericles, appeared. She was a large coarse-looking  woman, and with her were three boys, her own two and Alcibiades, a  handsome lad, who was a ward of Pericles and a member of his family.    Melas approached her and opened his cloak.    \"Why, Melas, what have you there?\" cried Telesippe in amazement, as she  saw the little black rain.    \"A portent, Madam,\" said Melas with solemnity. \"This ram, born on your  husband's farm, is a prodigy, it has but one horn. I have brought it to  you, that the omen might be interpreted. I trust it may prove a favorable  one.\"    Telesippe looked at the lamb and turned pale. She struck her hands  together. The porter and another slave at once appeared.    \"Go to the temple and bring Lampon, the priest,\" she said to the slave;  and to the porter she added, \"and you, the moment the priest arrives,  call your master.\"    The slave instantly disappeared, and the porter went back to his post by  the entrance. Although Telesippe was evidently disturbed and anxious  about the portent, she now turned her attention to the basket, which Dion  and Daphne had placed before her, and when their luncheon had been taken  out, she called a slave woman and gave the fowl and the eggs and cheese  into her care.    The three boys, meanwhile, crowded around Melas and the lamb and asked  questions of all sorts about it and about the farm. It seemed but a short  time when the porter opened the door once more and ushered in the priest.  The Twins had never seen a priest, since there were none on the island,  and they looked with awe upon this man who could read omens and interpret  dreams. He was a tall, spare man with piercing dark eyes. He was dressed  in a long white robe, and wore a wreath of laurel upon his brow, and his  black hair fell over his neck in long, straggling locks.    No sooner had he entered the court and taken his place beside the  altar than the blue curtains of a door at the right parted and a tall  noble-looking man entered the room. Dion and Daphne knew at once that it  must be Pericles. No other man, they thought, could look so majestic.  Their knees shook under them, and they felt just as you would feel if you  were suddenly to meet the President of the United States. Pericles was  not alone. A man also tall, and wearing a long white cloak, followed  him through the curtains and joined the group about the altar.    \"The Stranger!\" gasped Daphne to Dion in a whisper. \"Don't you remember?  He said he knew Pericles!\"    The Stranger spoke to Melas and laid his hand playfully upon the heads of  the Twins.    \"These are old friends of mine,\" he said to Pericles. \"I stayed at their  house one night last spring.\"    Pericles had already greeted the priest. Now he smiled pleasantly at the  children, and spoke to Melas.    \"I hear a miracle has occurred on my farm,\" he said.    For answer Melas showed the lamb, which now began to jump and wriggle in  his arms.    \"There can be no doubt that the portent concerns the Great Archon,\" said  the priest solemnly. \"See how the ram leaps the moment he appears!\"    Pericles beckoned to the Stranger. \"What do you think of this,  Anaxagoras?\" he said, smiling.    \"I am no soothsayer,\" answered the Stranger, smiling too. \"The priest is  the one to expound the riddle.\"    Lampon now came forward, and, with an air of importance, pulled a few  hairs from the lamb's fleece, and laid them upon the live coals of the  altar. He watched the hair curl up as it burned and bent his ear to  listen. \"It burns with a crackling sound,\" he said; \"the omen is  therefore favorable to your house, O Pericles. Instead of two horns, the  animal has but one! Instead of two factions in Athens, one favorable to  Pericles, one opposed, there will henceforth be but one! All the city  will unite under the leadership of Pericles the Olympian.\"    \"The Gods be praised!\" exclaimed Telesippe, with fervor.    The priest clapped his hands and bowed his head, and Dion saw him peer  cautiously through the tangled locks which fell over his face to see how  Pericles had taken this prophecy. The Great Archon was standing quietly  beside Anaxagoras, and neither one gave any sign of being impressed by  the oracle. The priest scowled under his wreath.    \"What shall be done with the ram?\" asked Telesippe, when Lampon again  lifted his head.    \"Let it be sent to the temple as an offering. Since it is black it must  be sacrificed to the Gods of the lower world,\" answered the priest.    Telesippe at once called a slave. Melas gave the ram into his hands; the  priest received a present of money from Pericles, and, followed by the  slave with the ram, disappeared through the doorway.    \"You did well to bring the ram to me at once,\" said Pericles to Melas  when the door closed behind the priest. \"Take this present for your  pains,\" and he placed a gold-piece in Melas' hand. \"And these little  boys,\" he added, smiling pleasantly at the Twins, \"they too have done  their share in bringing the portent. They must have a reward as well.\" He  gave them each a coin, and, when he had received their thanks, at once  left the house, followed by Anaxagoras. The Twins and Melas then said  good-bye to Telesippe and the boys and took their leave.    When they turned the corner into the next street, Melas said with a sigh,  \"There, that's off my mind. And I hope there will be no more miracles for  a while.\"    \"If it would take us to the house of Pericles every time, I'd like them  at least once a week!\" cried Dion, looking longingly at the coin Pericles  had given him.    \"So would I,\" Daphne added fervently. \"Even if Pericles didn't give us  anything at all, I'd come to Athens just to look at him! He looks just  like the Gods. I know he does.\"    Melas laughed. \"You're just like the Athenians,\" he said, \"They call him  the Olympian because they feel the same way about him. Give me your  coins,\" he added. \"I will put them in my purse for safe-keeping.\"    \"Anyway,\" said Daphne, as she and Dion gave their Father the money, \"I'm  glad the portent was favorable to Pericles. The old woman on the boat was  right. She said it would be.\"          VI    THE FESTIVAL OF ATHENA      The day had begun so early that it was still morning when Melas and the  Twins left the house of Pericles and took their way toward the Agora,  which was the business and social center of Athens. Here were the markets  where everything necessary to the daily life of the Athenians was sold.  The Twins had never dreamed there were so many things to be found in the  world. Not only were there fruits, meats, fish, vegetables, and flowers,  but there were stalls filled with beautiful pottery or with dyed and  embroidered garments gorgeous in color, and even with books. The books  were not bound as ours are. They were written on rolls of parchment and  were piled up in the stalls like sticks of wood. Around the marketplace  there were arcades supported by marble columns, and ornamented by rows of  bronze statues. In the center stood a magnificent altar to the twelve  Gods of Olympus, whom the people of Hellas believed to be the greatest of  their many Gods. There were temples opening on the Agora, and beyond  the temples there were the hills of Athens, with the Sacred Mount of the  Acropolis, the holiest of all holy places, bounding it on the south.    Melas had seen all these sights before, but to the Twins it was like  stepping right into the middle of an enchanted world. Melas took them  each by the hand, and found an out-of-the-way corner near a stall where  young girls were selling wreaths, and there they ate their luncheon,  while they watched the people swarming about them.    The flowers-sellers, the bread-women, and some flute-girls were almost  the only women in sight, but the whole Agora was full of men. There were  fathers of families buying provisions for the day. Each was followed by a  slave with a basket, for no Athenian gentleman would carry his own  packages. There were always slaves to do that. There were grave men in  long cloak-like garments with fillets around their heads who walked back  and forth talking together. There were boys, followed by their  \"pedagogues,\" old slaves who carried their books for them, and saw to it  that their young charges got into as little mischief as possible, as they  went about the streets.    Suddenly at some signal which neither Melas nor the Twins saw, the whole  crowd began to move toward the south.    \"Where are they going?\" asked Dion.    \"Listen to that little Spartan savage,\" said one of the wreath-sellers,  laughing. \"He doesn't even know it's the regular festival of Athena. Run  along, bumpkin, and see the sights.\"    Melas gave the girl a black look. He didn't like to have Dion called a  \"Spartan savage,\" nor a \"bumpkin\" either, but he knew very well Spartans  might expect scant courtesy in Athens, so he said nothing, but he rose  from his corner at once and, telling the children to follow, started  after the crowd.    They reached the steep incline which led up to the Acropolis, and, still  following the crowd, had gone part way to the summit, when there was a  mighty pushing and jostling among the people, and loud voices cried,  \"Make way for the sacred procession.\" The crowd parted, and Melas and  the Twins were pushed back toward one side, but as they were lucky enough  to be on the border of the crowd, instead of being pressed farther back,  they were able to see the sacred procession of the Goddess Athena as it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9976"],[0,"Hernani (#8)"],[1,"minds  of men and on the map of Europe, were at no time during the next  seven hundred years really greater than in his reign. In general the  Emperors claimed dominion over Italy, Germany, the Low Countries, and  much of what is now the Austrian Empire, Switzerland, and France,  besides the precedence over all other kings and potentates. They  desired to be considered, and by most men were considered, to be in  temporal things the counterpart of the Popes in things spiritual, and  with jurisdiction no less widespread. It was traditional that the king  chosen by the seven great princes, or electors, of Germany, should  proceed to Rome, there to be crowned Emperor by the Pope. With not a  few exceptions these honors were confined for long periods of time to  certain families. The first member of the house of Hapsburg who won  the election was Rudolf (1272-1292), founder of the present Austrian  dynasty. Another Hapsburger, Albert I, was chosen in 1298, and  another, Albert II, in 1438; since when, until the annihilation of the  Holy Roman Empire in 1806, all the Emperors, with two exceptions, have  been of that house.    None of his successors made such an impression upon the imagination  of contemporary and following generations as was produced by  the stupendous figure of Charles the Great. His reputation was  well-earned. He can be called, better than any other man, the creator  of mediaeval Europe. In his day looked upon as a Roman, the French  have adopted him as the father of their nationality, and he is the  hero of their ancient epic poetry. Yet, as Mr. Bryce declares, he was  entirely German: «No claim can be more groundless than that which the  modern French, the sons of the Latinized Kelts, set up to the Teutonic  Charles. At Rome he might assume the chlamys and the sandals (marks of  a Roman patrician), but at the head of his Frankish host he strictly  adhered to the customs of his country, and was beloved by his people  as the very ideal of their own character and habits. Of strength  and stature almost superhuman, in swimming and hunting unsurpassed,  steadfast and terrible in fight, to his friends gentle and  condescending, he was a Roman, much less a Gaul, in nothing but his  culture and his schemes of government, otherwise a Teuton. The centre  of his realm was the Rhine; his capitals Aachen and Engilenheim; his  army Frankish; his sympathies--as they are shown in the gathering of  the old hero-lays, the composition of a German grammar, the ordinance  against confining prayer to the three languages, Hebrew, Greek, and  Latin--were all for the race from which he sprang, and whose advance,  represented by the victory of Austrasia, the true Frankish fatherland,  over Neustria and Aquitaine, spread a second Germanic wave over the  conquered countries.» (Bryce: «Holy Roman Empire», pp. 71 and 72.)    It is a long jump from the crowning of Charles the Great, in A.D. 800,  to the accession of Maximilian I, of the house of Hapsburg, in 1493.  The imperial dignity, as such, had declined. The power of Maximilian  lay in his hereditary possession of the grandduchy of Austria and  his acquisition, by marriage, of the Burgundian lands, including  Franche-Comté, Luxemburg, Flanders, Holland, Zeeland, Brabant, and  Limburg; in other words, a territory which embraced what is now  Belgium, Dauphiny, Burgundy, and parts of Holland, of Provence, of  Languedoc, and of Savoy. Philip, son of this Maximilian, married  Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Ferdinand, head of the  united kingdoms of Aragon and Leon, and Isabella, Queen of Castile,  had by their marriage, in 1469, consolidated Spain into a strong  kingdom. Through their success in promoting industry and conquering  the Moors of Granada, and by the discovery of America, Spain rose to  a dominant position in European politics. Joanna became hopelessly  insane. Philip, for two years King of Castile, after the death of  Isabella in 1504, died in 1506. Charles, son of Philip and Joanna, was  born at Ghent in 1500. From his maternal grandparents he inherited  Aragon (with Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia) and Castile (with the  American colonies). He had been brought up at his father's court in  Brussels, and was not really Spanish in sympathies or culture. On  the death of his grandfather, Ferdinand the Catholic, in 1516, the  Cardinal Ximenes protected his interests until his arrival in Spain,  in 1517. The beginnings of his career as Charles I. of Spain were  weak. His mother, though shut up in a madhouse, was nominally joint  ruler with him, and his Spanish subjects took advantage of this fact  to oppose him and his Flemish favorites.    He unjustly and ungratefully degraded Ximenes, and showed little  indication of tact and small sense of responsibility. In 1519, on the  death of his grandfather Maximilian, Charles became Grand Duke of  Austria, inheriting from him also Burgundy, which had come into the  family with his grandmother, Mary of Burgundy. He immediately set up  his candidacy for election as German King. His opponents were Henry  VIII of England and Francis I of France, the latter a real and  formidable rival.    The electors were the Archbishops of Trier (Treves), Mainz, and  Cologne, the Duke of Saxony, the Count Palatine, the King of Bohemia,  and the Margrave of Brandenburg. The constitution of the electoral  body had been settled in 1356 by an instrument called the Golden  Bull, issued by the Emperor Charles IV and confirmed at the Diet of  Nuremberg: By it Frankfort was made the place of election, and the  Archbishop of Mainz convener of the college.    In June 1519 this body was convoked at Frankfort, and after hearing  the claims of Francis and Charles, offered the imperial crown to one  of their own number, the Elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise. He  declined it in favor of Charles, who was then elected. It took nine  days for the news to travel to Barcelona, where the young man was.  Naturally elated at his success he assumed, even in his decrees as  King of Spain, the title of Majesty, which up to that time no mere  king had received; disregarded the appeals of his Spanish subjects  to remain in that country; and hastened to Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle),  where he was crowned German King in October 1520.    After ten years of political and military activity, contests with  Luther and his adherents, wars with Francis I, who laid claim to  Burgundy and Northern Italy, Charles was crowned Emperor, at Bologna,  in 1530. From then until 1555 he filled Europe with the blaze of his  achievements, reviving the almost vanished prestige of the imperial  office. In 1555 he abdicated his throne and retired to the monastery  of San Yuste, near Plasencia, where, in 1558, he died.

L'auteur de ce drame écrivait il y a peu de semaines à propos d'un  poëte mort[1] avant l'âge:    «...Dans ce moment de mêlée et de tourmente littéraire, qui faut-il  plaindre, ceux qui meurent ou ceux qui combattent? Sans doute, il est  triste de voir un poëte de vingt ans qui s'en va, une lyre qui se  brise, un avenir qui s'évanouit; mais n'est-ce pas quelque chose aussi  que le repos? N'est-il pas permis à ceux autour desquels s'amassent  incessamment calomnies, injures, haines, jalousies, sourdes menées,  basses trahisons; hommes loyaux auxquels on fait une guerre déloyale;  hommes dévoués qui ne voudraient enfin que doter le pays d'une liberté  de plus, celle de l'art, celle de l'intelligence; hommes laborieux qui  poursuivent paisiblement leur oeuvre de conscience, en proie d'un  côté à de viles machinations de censure[2] et de police, en butte de  l'autre, trop souvent, à l'ingratitude des esprits mêmes pour lesquels  ils travaillent; ne leur est-il pas permis de retourner quelquefois la  tête avec envie vers ceux qui sont tombés derrière eux et qui dorment  dans le tombeau? _Invideo_, disait Luther dans le cimetière de Worms,  _invideo, quia quiéscunt_.    «Qu'importe toutefois? Jeunes gens, ayons bon courage! Si rude qu'on  nous veuille faire le présent, l'avenir sera beau. Le romantisme, tant  de fois mal défini, n'est, à tout prendre, et c'est là sa définition  réelle, si l'on ne l'envisage que sous son côté militant, que le  _libéralisme_ en littérature. Cette vérité est déjà comprise à peu  près de tous les bons esprits, et le nombre en est grand; et bientôt,  car l'oeuvre est déjà bien avancée, le libéralisme littéraire ne sera  pas moins populaire que le libéralisme politique. La liberté dans  l'art, la liberté dans la société, voilà le double but auquel doivent  tendre d'un même pas tous les esprits conséquents et logiques; voilà  la double bannière qui rallie, à bien peu d'intelligences près  (lesquelles s'éclaireront), toute la jeunesse si forte et si patiente  d'aujourd'hui; puis, avec la jeunesse et à sa tête, l'élite de la  génération qui nous a précédés, tous ces sages vieillards qui, après  le premier moment de défiance et d'examen, ont reconnu que ce que font  leur fils est une conséquence de ce qu'ils ont fait eux-mêmes, et que  la liberté littéraire est fille de la liberté politique. Ce principe  est celui du siècle, et prévaudra. Les _Ultras_ de tout genre,  classiques ou monarchiques, auront beau se prêter secours pour refaire  l'ancien régime de toutes pièces, société et littérature; chaque  progrès du pays, chaque développement des intelligences, chaque pas  de la liberté fera crouler tout ce qu'ils auront échafaudé. Et,  en définitive, leurs efforts de réaction auront été utiles. En  révolution, tout mouvement fait avancer. La vérité et la liberté ont  cela d'excellent que tout ce qu'on fait pour elles et tout ce qu'on  fait contre elles les sert également. Or, après tant de grandes choses  que nos pères ont faites et que nous avons vues,"]]]
