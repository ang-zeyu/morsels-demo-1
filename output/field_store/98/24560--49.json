I even found the searchlight stations back  on the hills to be in a deplorable state.  Indeed, on the night of  Togo's second attack on Port Arthur the power plant was out of order  and the searchlights which should have flooded the harbor with light  were dark.  The plant was subsequently repaired under enormous  difficulties and cost, but of no avail.  Coolie spies had procured the  exact location of the power house and searchlight stations and thus  aided, the Japanese gunners riddled them with shell.  A great deal has  been said about the wonderful marksmanship of the Japanese, but for  the most part it was due to data on exact distances and locations,  furnished by their spies.    Although the officers were a careless, thoughtless lot, I found that  the personnel of the garrison contained, on the whole, a good type of  Russian soldier.  They were not brilliant but faithful and obedient.  A Russian regiment is never routed.  They stand and are killed, being  too stolid to run.  I found most of the officers of Port Arthur to be  brilliant dashing men of the world, personally of high animal courage,  but self-indulgence, neglect, disbelief in hostilities and  underestimation of their foe, undermined them.    Among the high officials at Port Arthur, Colonel Reiss, Commander of  the Ordnance Service, stood out alone.  He was the only officer, not  excepting General Stoessel himself, who seemed to realize the gravity  of the whole situation.  In long chats which I had with him, he more  than hinted at the lamentable state of his ammunition.  Once I asked  him why these conditions were not changed and he said:    \"The Little Father (the Czar) is far away,\"--he shrugged expressively.    Officers told me that tons and tons of ammunition bags did not contain  full weight.  Whole ammunition trucks had only a double layer of  powder bags on top, the rest containing sand bags to be used only for  bastions and escarpions, the money flowing into the pockets of the  army contractors.  I met General Stoessel at the Casino twice, and  neither time did he impress me as a military genius.  A soldier of the  Buller type, he was bluff, hearty, courageous and stupid.  His florid  bearded face, thick-set figure and his deep guttural growls reminded  me of a Boer _Dopper_.    Among all the Russians I met at Port Arthur, the most interesting  figure was to me the great battle painter Verestshagin.  I am proud to  be able to say that he called me \"friend.\"  I happened to be of some  assistance to him in alleviating an attack of malaria.  This, with a  similar taste in the arts and literature, soon put us on a friendly  and intimate footing.  I have met many men of letters, artists and  statesmen, but never one who impressed me so much with the profundity  of his learning and thought as did Verestshagin, and I am not easily  impressed.    One night we were sitting on the Casino veranda overlooking the  wonderful Harbor of Port Arthur.  It was one of those quiet, balmy,  semi-tropical nights for which this part of the world is famous, one  of those crystal, clear, soundless nights, and the silhouettes of  Russia's grim silent battle monsters riding at anchor were sharply  outlined on the moonlit waters of the bay.  We were smoking our pipes,  having just finished a long chat about the history of these  regions--the old Manchu and Tartar dynasties, how far they had  influenced and still influence the history of the world, the  _Volker-Wanderung_--of the Huns, the Goths, and Vandals--a subject on  which Verestshagin disclosed a deep store of knowledge.    As the night was far advanced, I suggested that I had probably  trespassed long enough on his kindness and hospitality.  He turned  around in his chair and placing his hand on my shoulder said in his  soft deep voice:    \"No, Doctor Cannitz, you are doing me a service instead.  I am  restless to-night.  I have a curious presentiment that before long  these lovely hills will hear the roar of guns in earnest.\"  Dreamily  speaking as if to himself he continued, \"And Russia will lose .  .  .  but I shall not see it.\"  Abruptly he looked up, sat erect in his  chair and shook himself as if throwing off something that oppressed  him.    \"Do you believe in premonition.  Doctor?  I know I shall find my death  here soon.\"    An indescribable shuddery sensation seemed to pass over me.  I am by  no means sentimental or easily moved, nor am I overly superstitious;  but I have encountered one or two things in the course of my life  which cannot be explained by rule and line.  Throwing off my sudden  strange mood, I told Verestshagin that his morbid fancies were due to  his still feverish condition, and the depressing effect of over-doses  of sulphate of quinine.  He rose and smiled, and said:    \"Of course you are right, Doctor.\"    Before parting, he gave me a little sketch of Port Arthur which I have  still.  I keep it as a treasured memento of one of the few really good  men I have met, and one of the few from whom I had been able to part  without harming.    Verestshagin's premonition was fulfilled.  He died--a hero's death,  going down with Admiral Marakoff on the flagship of the Russian  squadron six weeks later.    I remained at Port Arthur for another five weeks, and exactly seven  days before Togo's first night attack I received a cable from my  government.  It was in cipher, of course, and I was ordered to leave  Port Arthur immediately and make my way home as there was danger of my  being bottled up at any minute.  It is significant that in the  Intelligence Department at Berlin they knew an attack was imminent,  although they did not know it at Port Arthur.  Furthermore, Russian  securities dropped eighteen points on the New York Stock Exchange,  hours before the official knowledge of the attack came through.  This  information leaked out through the German Embassy in Washington.  Seven days after I left, Togo made the torpedo attack in which he sank  the _Czarevitch_, _Retvitsan_ and _Palada_.    Before I took the steamer back to Europe, I went to Kiou-Chau, the  German colony in China, and filed a long report by cipher cable.  Six  months later I had the satisfaction of having a talk with numerous  officers of the German General Staff and of receiving compliments on  the correctness of my observations, reports and predictions.    Later I learned the reasons why I had been sent to Port Arthur.  Germany desired to ascertain the exact relative strength of the Port  Arthur defenses and Russian positions in the Far East for the  following reasons:    Since the time of Frederick the Great, the only power on the Continent  which Germany has feared and has always been loath openly to quarrel  with, is Russia.  Through the setback she received in the Far East in  1905, her influence steadily decreased in the Balkans and the recent  fiasco of Russian machinations during the Balkan war, has made her  become a secondary factor for decades to come.  Germany, through her  keen Intelligence Department, foresaw the result of the Russo-Japanese  conflict and immediately set about to undermine and destroy Russian  influence south of the Austrian border.    By Russia's defeat in the East, the balance of the power was  completely shifted.  It gave Germany and Austria the desired  opportunities and a free hand in the Balkans and Turkey.  Had Germany  through her Intelligence Department found Russia invulnerable in the  East, the map of the Balkans would have to be painted in different  colors--as you will see.      Chapter IV. At the Sublime Porte    I was back in Berlin from my mission to the Far East on March 10,  1905.  The next four months were rather commonplace--odd little  commissions of no particular interest or importance.    On July the 5th, however, there came a hurried summons from Captain  von Tappken for me to report at Koenigergratzerstrasse 70.  I lost no  time in getting around, nor did I have to wait to be ushered up.  I  was shown direct to the Captain's office and as he received me, I  noticed that he was in a rather excited frame of mind.    \"Verdammt!  Doctor!  I am going to lose you.  I am requested by the  Wilhelmstrasse to hand you over to them.  Very annoying.  I do not  like to lose you from our branch here.  But we must obey.\"    I expressed my regrets.    \"Doctor, you are bettering yourself.  It is seldom that they over  there take any notice of us over here, or request the services of any  of my men.  But your work has attracted some attention.  I shall  request that your services are not entirely lost to this department.  Herr Stammer will take you over.  Good-by and good luck!\"    He gave me a hearty handshake and my connection with the Intelligence  Department of the Imperial Navy came to an end.  Stammer and I hailed  a taxi and drove to the Wilhelmstrasse, where the doorkeeper put me  through an official ceremony similar to the procedure of  Koenigergratzerstrasse 70.  Stammer gave the commissaire his card and  we were shown into a chamber and bidden to wait.  I was frankly  curious about what was in store for me, but I knew better by now than  to ask questions.  Presently there entered a tall, thin, iron-gray  gentleman, the very type of a Prussian bureaucrat.  Walking with quick  nervous steps to his desk he acknowledged our bows with a curt nod and  turning to Stammer he said:    \"Well, Stammer?\"    \"This is Dr. Graver, your Excellency.\"    \"Ah, yes.  Sehr schÃ¶n.  Convey my thanks to Captain Tappken,  Stammer.\"    Stammer then bowing himself out, I was asked to step into an anteroom.  There a secretary took me in hand and informed me that the tall, thin,  iron-gray gentleman was Graf Botho von Wedel, Wirklicher Geheimrat and  Vortragender Rab Botho Kaiser--(Privy Councilor to the German  Emperor).    So--Count Wedel.  H'm!  Although this was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#8)"],[1,"a brig would make no difference one  way or another. The question is, could we get her out?\"    \"It would be no easy matter,\" Peters said, shaking his head. \"That  French ship that came in this afternoon has taken up a berth outside  us, and there would be no getting out until she moved out of the  way. If she were not there it might be tried, though it would be  difficult to do so without attracting attention. As for the Spanish  war vessels, of which there are four in the port, I should not fear  them if we once got our sails up, for the Venture can sail faster  than these lubberly Spaniards; but they would send rowboats after  us, and unless the wind was strong these would speedily overhaul  us.\"    \"Well, I must think it over,\" Captain Martin said. \"I should be  sorry indeed to lose my ship, which would be well nigh ruin to me,  but if there is no other way we must make for Haarlem by boat.\"    The next day the work of unloading continued. In the afternoon the  captain of the French ship lying outside them came on board. He had  been in the habit of trading with Holland, and addressed Captain  Martin in Dutch.    \"Are you likely to be lying here long?\" he asked. \"I want to get  my vessel alongside the wharf as soon as I can, for it is slow work  unloading into these lighters. There are one or two ships going  out in the morning, but I would rather have got in somewhere about  this point if I could, for the warehouses of Mynheer Strous, to  whom my goods are consigned, lie just opposite.\"    \"Will you come down into my cabin and have a glass of wine with  me,\" Captain Martin said, \"and then we can talk it over?\"    Captain Martin discovered, without much trouble, that the French  captain was a Huguenot, and that his sympathies were all with the  people of the Netherlands.    \"Now,\" he said, \"I can speak freely to you. I was ashore the day  before yesterday, and learned that my wife's father, her three  brothers, and one of their wives have been murdered by the Spaniards.  Well, you can understand that in my grief and rage I cursed the  Spaniards and their doings. I have learnt that some spy has denounced  me, and that they are only waiting for me to set foot on shore to  arrest me, and you know what will come after that; for at present,  owing to the volunteers that have come over to Brill and Flushing,  the Spaniards are furious against the English. They would rather  take me on shore than on board, but if they find that I do not  land they will certainly come on board for me. They believe that I  shall not be unloaded until noon tomorrow, and doubtlessly expect  that as soon as the cargo is out I shall land to arrange for a  freight to England. Therefore, until tomorrow afternoon I am safe,  but no longer. Now, I am thinking of trying to get out quietly  tonight; but to do so it is necessary that you should shift your  berth a ship's length one way or the other. Will you do this for  me?\"    \"Certainly I will, with pleasure,\" the captain replied. \"I will  give orders at once.\"    \"No, that will never do,\" Captain Martin said. \"They are all the  more easy about me because they know that as long as your ship is  there I cannot get out, but if they saw you shifting your berth it  would strike them at once that I might be intending to slip away.  You must wait until it gets perfectly dark, and then throw off your  warps and slacken out your cable as silently as possible, and let  her drop down so as to leave me an easy passage. As soon as it is  dark I will grease all my blocks, and when everything is quiet try  to get her out. What wind there is is from the southwest, which  will take us well down the Zuider Zee.\"    \"I hope you may succeed,\" the French captain said. \"Once under  sail you would be safe from their warships, for you would be two  or three miles away before they could manage to get up their sails.  The danger lies in their rowboats and galleys.\"    \"Well, well, we must risk it,\" Captain Martin said. \"I shall have  a boat alongside, and if I find the case is desperate we will take  to it and row to the shore, and make our way to Haarlem, where we  should be safe.\"    Ned, who had been keeping a sharp lookout all day, observed that  two Spanish officials had taken up their station on the wharf, not  far from the ship. They appeared to have nothing to do, and to be  indifferent to what was going on. He told his father that he thought  that they were watching. Presently the merchant himself came down  to the wharf. He did not come on board, but spoke to Captain Martin  as he stood on the deck of the vessel, so that all around could  hear his words.    \"How are you getting on, Captain Martin?\" he asked in Dutch.    \"Fairly well,\" Captain Martin replied. \"I think if we push on we  shall have her empty by noon tomorrow.\"    \"I have a cargo to go back with you, you know,\" the merchant said,  \"and I shall want to see you at the office, if you will step round  tomorrow after you have cleared.\"    \"All right, Mynheer, you may expect me about two o'clock.    \"But you won't see me,\" he added to himself.    The merchant waved his hand and walked away, and a few minutes  later the two officials also strolled off.    \"That has thrown dust into their eyes,\" Captain Martin said, \"and  has made it safe for Strous. He will pretend to be as surprised as  any one when he hears I have gone.\"        CHAPTER III    A FIGHT WITH THE SPANIARDS      As soon as it became dark, and the wharves were deserted, Captain  Martin sent two sailors aloft with grease pots, with orders that  every block was to be carefully greased to ensure its running  without noise. A boat which rowed six oars was lowered noiselessly  into the water, and flannel was bound round the oars. The men,  who had been aware of the danger that threatened their captain,  sharpened the pikes and axes, and declared to each other that  whether the captain ordered it or not no Spaniards should set foot  on board as long as one of them stood alive on the decks. The cook  filled a great boiler with water and lighted a fire under it, and  the carpenter heated a caldron of pitch without orders.    \"What are you doing, Thompson?\" the captain asked, noticing the  glow of the fire as he came out of his cabin.    The sailor came aft before he replied, \"I am just cooking up a  little hot sauce for the dons, captain. We don't ask them to come,  you know; but if they do, it's only right that we should entertain  them.\"    \"I hope there will be no fighting, lad,\" the captain said.    \"Well, your honour, that ain't exactly the wish of me and my mates.  After what we have been hearing of, we feel as we sha'n't be happy  until we have had a brush with them 'ere Spaniards. And as to  fighting, your honour; from what we have heard, Captain Hawkins and  others out in the Indian seas have been ashowing them that though  they may swagger on land they ain't no match for an Englishman on  the sea. Anyhow, your honour, we ain't going to stand by and see  you and Master Ned carried away by these 'ere butchering Spaniards.    \"We have all made up our minds that what happens to you happens to  all of us. We have sailed together in this ship the Good Venture  for the last seventeen or eighteen years, and we means to swim  or sink together. No disrespect to you, captain; but that is the  fixed intention of all of us. It would be a nice thing for us to  sail back to the port of London and say as we stood by and saw our  captain and his son carried off to be hung or burnt or what not  by the Spaniards, and then sailed home to tell the tale. We don't  mean no disrespect, captain, I says again; but in this 'ere business  we take our orders from Mr. Peters, seeing that you being consarned  as it were in the affair ain't to be considered as having, so to  speak, a right judgment upon it.\"    \"Well, well, we shall see if there is a chance of making a  successful fight,\" Captain Martin said, unable to resist a smile  at the sailor's way of putting it.    The night was dark, and the two or three oil lamps that hung suspended  from some of the houses facing the port threw no ray of light which  extended to the shipping. It was difficult to make out against the  sky the outline of the masts of the French vessel lying some twenty  yards away; but presently Ned's attention was called towards her  by a slight splash of her cable. Then he heard the low rumble as  the ropes ran out through the hawse holes, and saw that the masts  were slowly moving. In two or three minutes they had disappeared  from his sight. He went into the cabin.    \"The Frenchman has gone, father; and so noiselessly that I could  hardly hear her. If we can get out as quietly there is little fear  of our being noticed.\"    \"We cannot be as quiet as that, Ned. She has only to slack away  her cables and drift with the tide that turned half an hour ago,  we have got to tow out and set sail. However, the night is dark,  the wind is off shore, and everything is in our favour. Do you see  if there be anyone about on the decks of the ships above and below  us.\"    Ned went first on to the stern, and then to the bow. He could  hear the voices of men talking and singing in the forecastles, but  could hear no movement on the deck of either ship. He went down  and reported to his father.    \"Then, I think, we may as well start at once, Ned. There are  still sounds and noises in the town, and any noise we may make is  therefore less likely to be noticed than if we waited until everything  was perfectly still.\"    The sailors were all ready. All were barefooted so as to move as  noiselessly as possible. The four small cannon that the Good Venture  carried had been loaded to the muzzle with bullets and pieces of  iron. A search had been made below and several heavy lumps of stone,  a part of the ballast carried on some former occasion, brought  up and placed at intervals along the bulwarks. The pikes had been  fastened by a loose lashing to"]]]
