The design is described as consisting of \"radially formed ornaments on  the face of the molds or blocks of which the button is formed, combined  with the mode of winding the covering on the same, substantially as  set forth, whether the covering be of one or more colors.\" The  specification, in \"substantially\" setting forth the design, contained  this language: \"It will be obvious from the foregoing that the figures  can be changed at pleasure by giving the desired form to the face of the  mold by depressions and elevations which radiate from a point, whether  in the center of the mold or eccentric thereto.\"    In the consideration of the case by the Court no objection was made to  this statement or claim. In the case of Root _vs_. Ball, 4 McLean 180,  the learned judge instructed the jury that \"if they should find that the  defendants had infringed the plaintiff's patent by using substantially  the same device as ornamental on the same part of the stove they would,  of course, find the defendant guilty. To infringe a patent right it  is not necessary that the thing patented should be adopted in every  particular; but if, as in the present case, the design and figures  were substantially adopted by the defendants, they have infringed the  plaintiff's right. If they adopt the same principle the defendants are  guilty. The principle of a machine is that combination of mechanical  powers which produce a certain result. And in a case like the present,  where ornaments are used for a stove, it is an infringement to adopt the  design so as to produce substantially the same appearance.\"    It has been the constant practice to grant patents for designs for fonts  of type, for sets of silver plate, for a series of printers' flourishes,  and the like. This class of cases has always passed without objection.    Two other cases which have arisen within the Office deserve notive.  The first was for a series of miniature shoulder straps, with emblems  denoting rank, provided with a pin, to be worn under an officer's coat,  upon his vest, or as a lady's breastpin. The drawing shows eight of  these pins with emblems of rank, varying from that of second lieutenant  to major-general, specification describing the brooch for a second  lieutenant goes on to say: \"I propose to introduce, on some of them, the  different ornaments showing the respective ranks of the army, from a  major-generalship to a second lieutenancy. See Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  8.\"    The second case was that of an application for a monogram visiting  card, on which the name was to be inscribed or printed in the form of a  monogram. The applicant filed a drawing, showing a card upon which was  a monogram of his own name. In his specification he gives certain rules  for forming such monograms, and then says: \"It is manifest that the  form of the letters as well as the letters themselves can be changed as  required by circumstances or the taste of the individual for whom the  monogram is designed; and that the general form and outline of the  monogram may be varied; and indeed, must vary to be adapted to the  particular name it is required to represent.\"    The claim was for \"a monogram, visiting card, or visiting card upon  which the name is inscribed or printed in the form of a monogram,  substantially as herein specified.\"    This application was rejected by the Examiner and Board of  Examiners-in-Chief, but was allowed by the Commissioner upon appeal.    It is true that, before and since this patent was issued, many patents  have been refused for what I have called generic designs. One man having  designed a tack head, ornamented with radial lines, was compelled to  take out one patent for his tack with six radial lines, and another for  the same tack with eight. There are other instances of like character,  but they only serve to show that the practice of the Office has not been  uniform, and that the true practice is still to be adopted and followed.    I have no hesitation in saying, in view of the premises, that a valid  patent may be granted for a new genus or class of ornaments as well as  for specific ornaments, though I do not doubt that, under the statute,  every species, variety, and individual having distinct characteristics  under such a genus might also be patented, the patent being subordinate  and tributary to that which covered the class. From the nature of this  subject-matter there must always be more latitude in the issue of  patents for trifling changes, or form, or outline, since it is only  necessary that such changes should constitute a new \"design\" to entitle  them to a patent of this class.    The second question relates to the elements of utility in patents for  designs.    Upon this point, it is said by my predecessor, in Jason Crane _ex parte_  Commissioners, December-May, 1869, p. 1, that the construction which has  been given to the act of 1842, by the Office, ever since its passage, is  that it relates to designs for ornament merely; something of an artistic  character as contradistinguished to those of convenience or utility.    The Board of Examiners-in-Chief, in the present case, say \"The practice  of the Office has been uniform from the beginning, and has always  excluded cases like the present from the benefit of the laws relating to  designs.\" And, again, \"The general understanding has always been that  the acts of 1842 and 1861 were intended to cover articles making  pretensions to artistic excellence exclusively.\"    In thus denying that a new \"shape or configuration\" of an article,  whereby utility or convenience is promoted, is the proper subject of  a patent under the acts referred to, the Office would seem to have  involved itself in the absurdity that if a design is useless it may be  patented; whereas, if it be useful, it is entitled to no protection.    Fortunately no such \"uniform practice\" has existed, and the Office is  relieved from so grievous an imputation. The practice seems to have been  taken for granted by the appellate tribunals, and, so far from being  as stated, is, as nearly as possible, the reverse of it. Articles have  been, and are being, constantly patented as designs which possess no  element of the artistic or ornamental, but are valuable solely because,  by a new shape or configuration, they possess more utility than the  prior forms of like articles Of this character are designs for ax heads,  for reflectors, for lamp shades, for the soles of boots and shoes, which  have been heretofore patented as designs, and to this class might be  added, with great propriety, that class of so-called \"mechanical\"  patents, granted for mere changes of form, such as plowshares, fan  blowers, propeller blades, and others of like character.    When, therefore, my learned predecessor in Crane's case added to this  number a box so designed as to hold with convenience a set of furs, he  did but confirm and not alter the practice of the Office, so far as it  can be gleaned from the patented cases. I am of opinion that the class  of cases named in the act as arising from \"new shape or configuration\"  includes within it all those mere changes of form which involve increase  of utility. This I take to be the spirit of the decision in Wooster  _vs_. Crane, 2 Fisher 583. The design was of a reel in the shape of a  rhombus. The learned Judge says \"In this case, the reel itself, as an  article of manufacture, is conceded to be old and not the subject of  a patent. The shape applied to it by the complainant is also an old,  well-known mathematical figure. Now although it does not appear that  any person ever before applied this particular shape to this particular  article, I cannot think that the act quoted above was intended to secure  to the complainant an exclusive right to use this well known figure in  the manufacture of reels. The act, although it does not require utility  in order to secure the benefit of its provisions, does require that  the shape produced shall be the result of industry, effort genius, or  expense, and must also, I think, be held to require that the shape or  configuration sought to be secured shall, at least, be new and original  as applied to articles of manufacture. But here the shape is a common  one in many articles of manufacture, and its application to a reel  cannot fairly be said to be the result of industry, genius, effort,  and expense. No advantage whatever is pretended to be derived from the  adoption of the form selected by the complainant, except the incidental  one of using it as a trademark. Its selection can hardly be said to be  the result of effort even; it was simply an arbitrary chance selection  of one of many well-known shapes, all equally well adapted to the  purpose. To hold that such an application of a common form can  be secured by letters patent, would be giving the act of 1861 a  construction broader than I am willing to give it\"    It would seem from this language that if there had been \"advantage,\"  that is, utility in the adoption of the form of the rhombus, that it  would have found more favor in the eyes of the Court.    This subject has been well discussed in the opinion of Commissioner  Foote in Crane _ex parte_. I concur in that opinion, except as to  the recital of the former practice of the Office, which a careful  examination has shown to be erroneous.    The third question may be readily disposed of. Modes of operation or  construction, principles of action, combinations to secure novelty or  utility of movement, or compositions of matter, can hardly be said to be  \"shapes, configurations, or designs,\" but where the sole utility of the  new device arises from its new shape or configuration, I think it may  fairly be included among the subjects which the act of 1842 was designed  to protect.    The present case may, in view of the foregoing consideration, be  disposed of without difficulty.

[Illustration: MEDEA MEDITATING THE MURDER OF HER SONS]          ULYSSES      _Ulysses, a famous Greek hero, took a prominent part in the long siege of  Troy. After the fall of the city, he set out with his followers on his  homeward voyage to Ithaca, an island of which he was king; but being  driven out of his course by northerly winds, he was compelled to touch at  the country of the Lotus-eaters, who are supposed to have lived on the  north coast of Africa. Some of his comrades were so delighted with the  lotus fruit that they wished to remain in the country, but Ulysses  compelled them to embark again and continued his voyage. He next came to  the island of Sicily, and fell into the hands of the giant Polyphémus,  one of the Cyclópes. After several of his comrades had been killed by  this monster, Ulysses made his escape by stratagem and reached the  country of the winds. Here he received the help of Aeolus, king of the  winds, and having set sail again, arrived within sight of Ithaca; but  owing to the folly of his companions, the winds became suddenly adverse  and he was again driven back. He then touched at an island which was the  home of Circe, a powerful enchantress, who exercised her charms on his  companions and turned them into swine. By the help of the god Mercury,  Ulysses not only escaped this fate himself, but also forced Circe to  restore her victims to human shape. After staying a year with Circe, he  again set out and eventually reached his home_.      81. _HOMEWARD BOUND_    Urbem Tróiam á Graecís decem annós obsessam esse satis cónstat; dé hóc  enim belló Homérus, máximus poétárum Graecórum, Íliadem opus nótissimum  scrípsit.
