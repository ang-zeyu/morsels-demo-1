Once as he stood looking down at a newly fallen antagonist my eyes  happened to fall upon this mirror and in its shiny surface I saw  pictured a sight that caused me to whisper:    \"Move not, Tars Tarkas!  Move not a muscle!\"    He did not ask why, but stood like a graven image while my eyes watched  the strange thing that meant so much to us.    What I saw was the quick movement of a section of the wall behind me.  It was turning upon pivots, and with it a section of the floor directly  in front of it was turning.  It was as though you placed a  visiting-card upon end on a silver dollar that you had laid flat upon a  table, so that the edge of the card perfectly bisected the surface of  the coin.    The card might represent the section of the wall that turned and the  silver dollar the section of the floor.  Both were so nicely fitted  into the adjacent portions of the floor and wall that no crack had been  noticeable in the dim light of the chamber.    As the turn was half completed a great beast was revealed sitting upon  its haunches upon that part of the revolving floor that had been on the  opposite side before the wall commenced to move; when the section  stopped, the beast was facing toward me on our side of the  partition--it was very simple.    But what had interested me most was the sight that the half-turned  section had presented through the opening that it had made.  A great  chamber, well lighted, in which were several men and women chained to  the wall, and in front of them, evidently directing and operating the  movement of the secret doorway, a wicked-faced man, neither red as are  the red men of Mars, nor green as are the green men, but white, like  myself, with a great mass of flowing yellow hair.    The prisoners behind him were red Martians.  Chained with them were a  number of fierce beasts, such as had been turned upon us, and others  equally as ferocious.    As I turned to meet my new foe it was with a heart considerably  lightened.    \"Watch the wall at your end of the chamber, Tars Tarkas,\" I cautioned,  \"it is through secret doorways in the wall that the brutes are loosed  upon us.\"  I was very close to him and spoke in a low whisper that my  knowledge of their secret might not be disclosed to our tormentors.    As long as we remained each facing an opposite end of the apartment no  further attacks were made upon us, so it was quite clear to me that the  partitions were in some way pierced that our actions might be observed  from without.    At length a plan of action occurred to me, and backing quite close to  Tars Tarkas I unfolded my scheme in a low whisper, keeping my eyes  still glued upon my end of the room.    The great Thark grunted his assent to my proposition when I had done,  and in accordance with my plan commenced backing toward the wall which  I faced while I advanced slowly ahead of him.    When we had reached a point some ten feet from the secret doorway I  halted my companion, and cautioning him to remain absolutely motionless  until I gave the prearranged signal I quickly turned my back to the  door through which I could almost feel the burning and baleful eyes of  our would be executioner.    Instantly my own eyes sought the mirror upon Tars Tarkas' back and in  another second I was closely watching the section of the wall which had  been disgorging its savage terrors upon us.    I had not long to wait, for presently the golden surface commenced to  move rapidly.  Scarcely had it started than I gave the signal to Tars  Tarkas, simultaneously springing for the receding half of the pivoting  door.  In like manner the Thark wheeled and leaped for the opening  being made by the inswinging section.    A single bound carried me completely through into the adjoining room  and brought me face to face with the fellow whose cruel face I had seen  before.  He was about my own height and well muscled and in every  outward detail moulded precisely as are Earth men.    At his side hung a long-sword, a short-sword, a dagger, and one of the  destructive radium revolvers that are common upon Mars.    The fact that I was armed only with a long-sword, and so according to  the laws and ethics of battle everywhere upon Barsoom should only have  been met with a similar or lesser weapon, seemed to have no effect upon  the moral sense of my enemy, for he whipped out his revolver ere I  scarce had touched the floor by his side, but an uppercut from my  long-sword sent it flying from his grasp before he could discharge it.    Instantly he drew his long-sword, and thus evenly armed we set to in  earnest for one of the closest battles I ever have fought.    The fellow was a marvellous swordsman and evidently in practice, while  I had not gripped the hilt of a sword for ten long years before that  morning.    But it did not take me long to fall easily into my fighting stride, so  that in a few minutes the man began to realize that he had at last met  his match.    His face became livid with rage as he found my guard impregnable, while  blood flowed from a dozen minor wounds upon his face and body.    \"Who are you, white man?\" he hissed.  \"That you are no Barsoomian from  the outer world is evident from your colour.  And you are not of us.\"    His last statement was almost a question.    \"What if I were from the Temple of Issus?\" I hazarded on a wild guess.    \"Fate forfend!\" he exclaimed, his face going white under the blood that  now nearly covered it.    I did not know how to follow up my lead, but I carefully laid the idea  away for future use should circumstances require it.  His answer  indicated that for all he KNEW I might be from the Temple of Issus and  in it were men like unto myself, and either this man feared the inmates  of the temple or else he held their persons or their power in such  reverence that he trembled to think of the harm and indignities he had  heaped upon one of them.    But my present business with him was of a different nature than that  which requires any considerable abstract reasoning; it was to get my  sword between his ribs, and this I succeeded in doing within the next  few seconds, nor was I an instant too soon.    The chained prisoners had been watching the combat in tense silence;  not a sound had fallen in the room other than the clashing of our  contending blades, the soft shuffling of our naked feet and the few  whispered words we had hissed at each other through clenched teeth the  while we continued our mortal duel.    But as the body of my antagonist sank an inert mass to the floor a cry  of warning broke from one of the female prisoners.    \"Turn!  Turn!  Behind you!\" she shrieked, and as I wheeled at the first  note of her shrill cry I found myself facing a second man of the same  race as he who lay at my feet.    The fellow had crept stealthily from a dark corridor and was almost  upon me with raised sword ere I saw him.  Tars Tarkas was nowhere in  sight and the secret panel in the wall, through which I had come, was  closed.    How I wished that he were by my side now!  I had fought almost  continuously for many hours; I had passed through such experiences and  adventures as must sap the vitality of man, and with all this I had not  eaten for nearly twenty-four hours, nor slept.    I was fagged out, and for the first time in years felt a question as to  my ability to cope with an antagonist; but there was naught else for it  than to engage my man, and that as quickly and ferociously as lay in  me, for my only salvation was to rush him off his feet by the  impetuosity of my attack--I could not hope to win a long-drawn-out  battle.    But the fellow was evidently of another mind, for he backed and parried  and parried and sidestepped until I was almost completely fagged from  the exertion of attempting to finish him.    He was a more adroit swordsman, if possible, than my previous foe, and  I must admit that he led me a pretty chase and in the end came near to  making a sorry fool of me--and a dead one into the bargain.    I could feel myself growing weaker and weaker, until at length objects  commenced to blur before my eyes and I staggered and blundered about  more asleep than awake, and then it was that he worked his pretty  little coup that came near to losing me my life.    He had backed me around so that I stood in front of the corpse of his  fellow, and then he rushed me suddenly so that I was forced back upon  it, and as my heel struck it the impetus of my body flung me backward  across the dead man.    My head struck the hard pavement with a resounding whack, and to that  alone I owe my life, for it cleared my brain and the pain roused my  temper, so that I was equal for the moment to tearing my enemy to  pieces with my bare hands, and I verily believe that I should have  attempted it had not my right hand, in the act of raising my body from  the ground, come in contact with a bit of cold metal.    As the eyes of the layman so is the hand of the fighting man when it  comes in contact with an implement of his vocation, and thus I did not  need to look or reason to know that the dead man's revolver, lying  where it had fallen when I struck it from his grasp, was at my disposal.    The fellow whose ruse had put me down was springing toward me, the  point of his gleaming blade directed straight at my heart, and as he  came there rang from his lips the cruel and mocking peal of laughter  that I had heard within the Chamber of Mystery.    And so he died, his thin lips curled in the snarl of his hateful laugh,  and a bullet from the revolver of his dead companion bursting in his  heart.    His body, borne by the impetus of his headlong rush, plunged upon me.  The hilt of his sword must have struck my head, for with the impact of  the corpse I lost consciousness.

Just while we were talking, one of our men that was at  the door of our hut, told us that the carpenter, who it seems was upon a  hill at a distance, cried out, \"A sail! a sail!\"    We all turned out immediately; but, though it was very clear weather,  we could see nothing; but the carpenter continuing to halloo to us, \"A  sail! a sail!\" away we run up the hill, and there we saw a ship plainly;  but it was at a very great distance, too far for us to make any signal  to her. However, we made a fire upon the hill, with all the wood we  could get together, and made as much smoke as possible. The wind was  down, and it was almost calm; but as we thought, by a perspective glass  which the gunner had in his pocket, her sails were full, and she stood  away large with the wind at E.N.E., taking no notice of our signal, but  making for the Cape de Bona Speranza; so we had no comfort from her.    We went, therefore, immediately to work about our intended canoe; and,  having singled out a very large tree to our minds, we fell to work with  her; and having three good axes among us, we got it down, but it was  four days' time first, though we worked very hard too. I do not remember  what wood it was, or exactly what dimensions, but I remember that it was  a very large one, and we were as much encouraged when we launched it,  and found it swam upright and steady, as we would have been at another  time if we had had a good man-of-war at our command.    She was so very large, that she carried us all very, very easily, and  would have carried two or three tons of baggage with us; so that we  began to consult about going to sea directly to Goa; but many other  considerations checked that thought, especially when we came to look  nearer into it; such as want of provisions, and no casks for fresh  water; no compass to steer by; no shelter from the breach of the high  sea, which would certainly founder us; no defence from the heat of the  weather, and the like; so that they all came readily into my project, to  cruise about where we were, and see what might offer.    Accordingly, to gratify our fancy, we went one day all out to sea in her  together, and we were in a very fair way to have had enough of it;  for when she had us all on board, and that we were gotten about half  a league to sea, there happening to be a pretty high swell of the sea,  though little or no wind, yet she wallowed so in the sea, that we all of  us thought she would at last wallow herself bottom up; so we set all  to work to get her in nearer the shore, and giving her fresh way in the  sea, she swam more steady, and with some hard work we got her under the  land again.    We were now at a great loss; the natives were civil enough to us, and  came often to discourse with us; one time they brought one whom they  showed respect to as a king with them, and they set up a long pole  between them and us, with a great tassel of hair hanging, not on the  top, but something above the middle of it, adorned with little chains,  shells, bits of brass, and the like; and this, we understood afterwards,  was a token of amity and friendship; and they brought down to us  victuals in abundance, cattle, fowls, herbs, and roots; but we were in  the utmost confusion on our side; for we had nothing to buy with, or  exchange for; and as to giving us things for nothing they had no notion  of that again. As to our money, it was mere trash to them, they had no  value for it; so that we were in a fair way to be starved. Had we had  but some toys and trinkets, brass chains, baubles, glass beads, or, in  a word, the veriest trifles that a shipload of would not have been worth  the freight, we might have bought cattle and provisions enough for an  army, or to victual a fleet of men-of-war; but for gold or silver we  could get nothing.    Upon this we were in a strange consternation. I was but a young fellow,  but I was for falling upon them with our firearms, and taking all the  cattle from them, and send them to the devil to stop their hunger,  rather than be starved ourselves; but I did not consider that this might  have brought ten thousand of them down upon us the next day; and though  we might have killed a vast number of them, and perhaps have frighted  the rest, yet their own desperation, and our small number, would have  animated them so that, one time or other, they would have destroyed us  all.    In the middle of our consultation, one of our men who had been a kind  of a cutler, or worker in iron, started up and asked the carpenter if,  among all his tools, he could not help him to a file. \"Yes,\" says the  carpenter, \"I can, but it is a small one.\" \"The smaller the better,\"  says the other. Upon this he goes to work, and first by heating a piece  of an old broken chisel in the fire, and then with the help of his file,  he made himself several kinds of tools for his work. Then he takes three  or four pieces of eight, and beats them out with a hammer upon a stone,  till they were very broad and thin; then he cuts them out into the shape  of birds and beasts; he made little chains of them for bracelets and  necklaces, and turned them into so many devices of his own head, that it  is hardly to be expressed.    When he had for about a fortnight exercised his head and hands at this  work, we tried the effect of his ingenuity; and, having another meeting  with the natives, were surprised to see the folly of the poor people.  For a little bit of silver cut in the shape of a bird, we had two cows,  and, which was our loss, if it had been in brass, it had been still of  more value. For one of the bracelets made of chain-work, we had as much  provision of several sorts, as would fairly have been worth, in England,  fifteen or sixteen pounds; and so of all the rest. Thus, that which when  it was in coin was not worth sixpence to us, when thus converted  into toys and trifles, was worth a hundred times its real value, and  purchased for us anything we had occasion for.    In this condition we lived upwards of a year, but all of us began to be  very much tired of it, and, whatever came of it, resolved to attempt  an escape. We had furnished ourselves with no less than three very  good canoes; and as the monsoons, or trade-winds, generally affect that  country, blowing in most parts of this island one six months of a year  one way, and the other six months another way, we concluded we might be  able to bear the sea well enough. But always, when we came to look into  it, the want of fresh water was the thing that put us off from such an  adventure, for it is a prodigious length, and what no man on earth could  be able to perform without water to drink.    Being thus prevailed upon by our own reason to set the thoughts of that  voyage aside, we had then but two things before us; one was, to put to  sea the other way; viz., west, and go away for the Cape of Good Hope,  where, first or last, we should meet with some of our own country ships,  or else to put for the mainland of Africa, and either travel by land,  or sail along the coast towards the Red Sea, where we should, first or  last, find a ship of some nation or other, that would take us up; or  perhaps we might take them up, which, by-the-bye, was the thing that  always ran in my head.    It was our ingenious cutler, whom ever after we called silversmith, that  proposed this; but the gunner told him, that he had been in the Red Sea  in a Malabar sloop, and he knew this, that if we went into the Red Sea,  we should either be killed by the wild Arabs, or taken and made slaves  of by the Turks; and therefore he was not for going that way.    Upon this I took occasion to put in my vote again. \"Why,\" said I, \"do we  talk of being killed by the Arabs, or made slaves of by the Turks? Are  we not able to board almost any vessel we shall meet with in those seas;  and, instead of their taking us, we to take them?\" \"Well done, pirate,\"  said the gunner (he that had looked in my hand, and told me I should  come to the gallows), \"I'll say that for him,\" says he, \"he always looks  the same way. But I think, of my conscience, it is our only way now.\"  \"Don't tell me,\" says I, \"of being a pirate; we must be pirates, or  anything, to get fairly out of this cursed place.\"    In a word, they concluded all, by my advice, that our business was to  cruise for anything we could see. \"Why then,\" said I to them, \"our first  business is to see if the people upon this island have no navigation,  and what boats they use; and, if they have any better or bigger than  ours, let us take one of them.\" First, indeed, all our aim was to get,  if possible, a boat with a deck and a sail; for then we might have saved  our provisions, which otherwise we could not.    We had, to our great good fortune, one sailor among us, who had been  assistant to the cook; he told us, that he would find a way how to  preserve our beef without cask or pickle; and this he did effectually  by curing it in the sun, with the help of saltpetre, of which there was  great plenty in the island; so that, before we found any method for our  escape, we had dried the flesh of six or seven cows and bullocks,  and ten or twelve goats, and it relished so well, that we never gave  ourselves the trouble to boil it when we ate it, but either broiled it  or ate it dry. But our main difficulty about fresh water still remained;  for we had no vessel to put any into, much less to keep any for our  going to sea.    But our first voyage being only to coast the island, we resolved to  venture, whatever the hazard or consequence of it might be, and in order  to preserve as much fresh water as we could, our carpenter made a well  athwart the middle of one of our canoes, which he separated from the  other parts of the canoe, so as to make it tight to hold the water and  covered so as we might step upon it; and this was so large that it held  near a hogshead of water very well.
