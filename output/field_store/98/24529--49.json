The next one  that whispers must come out and stand in the middle of the floor. He  must stand there until he sees some one else whisper. Then he will  tell me, and the one whom he names must come and take his place. He,  in turn, will watch and report the first one that he sees whisper. And  so we will keep the game going till it is time for school to be  dismissed. The boy or girl who is standing at that time will be  punished for all of you.\"    \"What will the punishment be, Mr. Johnson?\" asked a bold, bad boy. \"A  good thrashing,\" answered the master. He was tired, he was vexed, he  hardly knew what he said.    The children thought the new game was very funny. First, Tommy Jones  whispered to Billy Brown and was at once called out to stand on the  floor. Within less than two minutes, Billy saw Mary Green whispering,  and she had to take his place. Mary looked around and saw Samuel Miller  asking his neighbor for a pencil, and Samuel was called. And so the  fun went on until the clock showed that it lacked only ten minutes  till school would be dismissed.    Then all became very good and very careful, for no one wished to be  standing at the time of dismissal. They knew that the master would be  as good as his word.  The clock ticked loudly, and Tommy Jones, who  was standing up for the fourth time, began to feel very uneasy. He  stood on one leg and then on the other, and watched very closely; but  nobody whispered. Could it be possible that he would receive that  thrashing? Suddenly, to his great joy he saw little Lucy Martin lean  over her desk and whisper to the girl in front of her. Now Lucy was  the pet of the school. Everybody loved her, and this was the first  time she had whispered that day. But Tommy didn't care for that. He  wished to escape the punishment, and so he called out, \"Lucy Martin!\"  and went proudly to his seat.    Little Lucy had not meant to whisper. There was something which she  wished very much to know before going home, and so, without thinking,  she had leaned over and whispered just three little words. With tears  in her eyes she went out and stood in the whisperer's place.    [Illustration]    She was very much ashamed and hurt, for it was the first time that she  had ever been in disgrace at school. The other girls felt sorry that  she should suffer for so small a fault. The boys looked at her and  wondered if the master would really be as good as his word.    The clock kept on ticking. It lacked only one minute till the bell  would strike the time for dismissal. What a shame that dear, gentle  Lucy should be punished for all those unruly boys and girls!    Then, suddenly, an awkward half-grown boy who sat right in front of  the master's desk turned squarely around and whispered to Tommy Jones,  three desks away.    Everybody saw him. Little Lucy Martin saw him through her tears, but  said nothing. Everybody was astonished, for that boy was the best  scholar in the school, and he had never been known to break a rule.    It lacked only half a minute now. The awkward boy turned again and  whispered so loudly that even the master could not help hearing:  \"Tommy, you deserve a thrashing!\"    \"Elihu Burritt, take your place on the floor,\" said the master sternly.  The awkward boy stepped out quickly, and little Lucy Martin returned  to her seat sobbing. At the same moment the bell struck and school was  dismissed.    After all the others had gone home, the master took down his long birch  rod and said: \"Elihu, I suppose I must be as good as my word. But tell  me why you so deliberately broke the rule against whispering.\"    \"I did it to save little Lucy,\" said the awkward boy, standing up very  straight and brave. \"I could not bear to see her punished.\"    \"Elihu, you may go home,\" said the master.    All this happened many years ago in New Britain, Connecticut. Elihu  Burritt was a poor boy who was determined to learn. He worked many  years as a blacksmith and studied books whenever he had a spare moment.  He learned many languages and became known all over the world as \"The  Learned Blacksmith.\"          HOW A PRINCE LEARNED TO READ    I        A thousand years ago boys and girls did not learn to read. Books were  very scarce and very precious, and only a few men could read them.    Each book was written with a pen or a brush. The pictures were painted  by hand, and some of them were very beautiful. A good book would  sometimes cost as much as a good house.    In those times there were even some kings who could not read. They  thought more of hunting and fighting than of learning.    There was one such king who had four sons, Ethelbald, Ethelbert,  Ethelred, and Alfred.[Footnote: Eth'el bald, Eth'el bert, Eth'el red,  Al'fred.] The three older boys were sturdy, half-grown lads; the  youngest, Alfred, was a slender, fair-haired child.    One day when they were with their mother, she showed them a wonderful  book that some rich friend had given her. She turned the leaves and  showed them the strange letters. She showed them the beautiful  pictures, and told them how they had been drawn and painted.    They admired the book very much, for they had never seen anything like  it. \"But the best part of it is the story which it tells,\" said their  mother. \"If you could only read, you might learn that story and enjoy  it. Now I have a mind to give this book to one of you\"    \"Will you give it to me, mother?\" asked little Alfred.    \"I will give it to the one who first learns to read in it\" she  answered.    \"I am sure I would rather have a good bow with arrows\" said Ethelred.    \"And I would rather have a young hawk that has been trained to hunt\"  said Ethelbert.    \"If I were a priest or a monk\" said Ethelbald, \"I would learn to read.  But I am a prince, and it is foolish for princes to waste their time  with such things.\"    \"But I should like to know the story which this book tells,\" said  Alfred.        II      A few weeks passed by. Then, one morning, Alfred went into his mother's  room with a smiling, joyous face.    \"Mother,\" he said, \"will you let me see that beautiful book again?\"    His mother unlocked her cabinet and took the precious volume from its  place of safe keeping.    Alfred opened it with careful fingers. Then he began with the first  word on the first page and read the first story aloud without making  one mistake.    \"O my child, how did you learn to do that?\" cried his mother.    \"I asked the monk, Brother Felix, to teach me,\" said Alfred. \"And every  day since you showed me the book, he has given me a lesson. It was no  easy thing to learn these letters and how they are put together to  make words. Now, Brother Felix says I can read almost as well as  he.\"    \"How wonderful!\" said his mother.    \"How foolish!\" said Ethelbald.    [Illustration]    \"You will be a good monk when you grow up,\" said Ethelred, with a  sneer.    But his mother kissed him and gave him the beautiful book. \"The prize  is yours, Alfred,\" she said. \"I am sure that whether you grow up to  be a monk or a king, you will be a wise and noble man.\"    And Alfred did grow up to become the wisest and noblest king that  England ever had. In history he is called Alfred the Great.          \"READ, AND YOU WILL KNOW\"        \"Mother, what are the clouds made of? Why does the rain fall? Where  does all the rain water go? What good does it do?\"    Little William Jones was always asking questions.    \"I want to know,\" he said; \"I want to know everything.\"    At first his mother tried to answer all his questions. But after he  had learned to read, she taught him to look in books for that which  he wished to know.    \"Mother, what makes the wind blow?\"    \"Read, and you will know, my child.\"    \"Who lives on the other side of the world?\"    \"Read, and you will know.\"    \"Why is the sky so blue?\"    \"Read, and you will know.\"    \"Oh, mother, I would like to know everything.\"    \"You can never know everything, my child. But you can learn many things  from books.\"    \"Yes, mother, I will read and then I will know.\"    He was a very little boy, but before he was three years old he could  read quite well. When eight years of age he was the best scholar at  the famous school at Harrow. He was always reading, learning,  inquiring.    \"I want to know; I want to know,\" he kept saying.    \"Read, and you will know,\" said his mother. \"Read books that are true.  Read about things that are beautiful and good. Read in order to become  wise.    \"Do not waste your time in reading foolish books. Do not read bad  books, they will make you bad. No book is worth reading that does not  make you better or wiser.\"    And so William Jones went on reading and learning. He became one of  the most famous scholars in the world. The king of England made him  a knight and called him Sir William Jones. Sir William Jones lived  nearly two hundred years ago. He was noted for his great knowledge,  the most of which he had obtained from books. It is said that he could  speak and write forty languages.          THE YOUNG CUPBEARER    I        Long, long ago, there lived in Persia a little prince whose name was  Cyrus. [Footnote: Cyrus (_pro_. si'rus).]    He was not petted and spoiled like many other princes. Although his  father was a king, Cyrus was brought up like the son of a common man.    He knew how to work with his hands. He ate only the plainest food. He  slept on a hard bed. He learned to endure hunger and cold.    When Cyrus was twelve years old he went with his mother to Media to  visit his grandfather. His grandfather, whose name was Astyages,  [Footnote: Astyages (_pro_. as ti'a jeez).] was king of Media, and very  rich and powerful.    Cyrus was so tall and strong and handsome that his grandfather was  very proud of him. He wished the lad to stay with him in Media. He  therefore gave him many beautiful gifts and everything that could  please a prince.

Suddenly I came to myself and, with that strange instinct which seems  ever to prompt me to my duty, I seized the cudgel, which had fallen to  the floor at the commencement of the battle, and swinging it with all  the power of my earthly arms I crashed it full upon the head of the  ape, crushing his skull as though it had been an eggshell.    Scarcely had the blow descended when I was confronted with a new  danger.  The ape's mate, recovered from its first shock of terror, had  returned to the scene of the encounter by way of the interior of the  building.  I glimpsed him just before he reached the doorway and the  sight of him, now roaring as he perceived his lifeless fellow stretched  upon the floor, and frothing at the mouth, in the extremity of his  rage, filled me, I must confess, with dire forebodings.    I am ever willing to stand and fight when the odds are not too  overwhelmingly against me, but in this instance I perceived neither  glory nor profit in pitting my relatively puny strength against the  iron muscles and brutal ferocity of this enraged denizen of an unknown  world; in fact, the only outcome of such an encounter, so far as I  might be concerned, seemed sudden death.    I was standing near the window and I knew that once in the street I  might gain the plaza and safety before the creature could overtake me;  at least there was a chance for safety in flight, against almost  certain death should I remain and fight however desperately.    It is true I held the cudgel, but what could I do with it against his  four great arms?  Even should I break one of them with my first blow,  for I figured that he would attempt to ward off the cudgel, he could  reach out and annihilate me with the others before I could recover for  a second attack.    In the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind I had turned  to make for the window, but my eyes alighting on the form of my  erstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four winds.  He  lay gasping upon the floor of the chamber, his great eyes fastened upon  me in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection.  I could not  withstand that look, nor could I, on second thought, have deserted my  rescuer without giving as good an account of myself in his behalf as he  had in mine.    Without more ado, therefore, I turned to meet the charge of the  infuriated bull ape.  He was now too close upon me for the cudgel to  prove of any effective assistance, so I merely threw it as heavily as I  could at his advancing bulk.  It struck him just below the knees,  eliciting a howl of pain and rage, and so throwing him off his balance  that he lunged full upon me with arms wide stretched to ease his fall.    Again, as on the preceding day, I had recourse to earthly tactics, and  swinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin I followed it  with a smashing left to the pit of his stomach.  The effect was  marvelous, for, as I lightly sidestepped, after delivering the second  blow, he reeled and fell upon the floor doubled up with pain and  gasping for wind.  Leaping over his prostrate body, I seized the cudgel  and finished the monster before he could regain his feet.    As I delivered the blow a low laugh rang out behind me, and, turning, I  beheld Tars Tarkas, Sola, and three or four warriors standing in the  doorway of the chamber.  As my eyes met theirs I was, for the second  time, the recipient of their zealously guarded applause.    My absence had been noted by Sola on her awakening, and she had quickly  informed Tars Tarkas, who had set out immediately with a handful of  warriors to search for me.  As they had approached the limits of the  city they had witnessed the actions of the bull ape as he bolted into  the building, frothing with rage.    They had followed immediately behind him, thinking it barely possible  that his actions might prove a clew to my whereabouts and had witnessed  my short but decisive battle with him.  This encounter, together with  my set-to with the Martian warrior on the previous day and my feats of  jumping placed me upon a high pinnacle in their regard.  Evidently  devoid of all the finer sentiments of friendship, love, or affection,  these people fairly worship physical prowess and bravery, and nothing  is too good for the object of their adoration as long as he maintains  his position by repeated examples of his skill, strength, and courage.    Sola, who had accompanied the searching party of her own volition, was  the only one of the Martians whose face had not been twisted in  laughter as I battled for my life.  She, on the contrary, was sober  with apparent solicitude and, as soon as I had finished the monster,  rushed to me and carefully examined my body for possible wounds or  injuries.  Satisfying herself that I had come off unscathed she smiled  quietly, and, taking my hand, started toward the door of the chamber.    Tars Tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing over  the now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life, and whose life  I, in turn, had rescued.  They seemed to be deep in argument, and  finally one of them addressed me, but remembering my ignorance of his  language turned back to Tars Tarkas, who, with a word and gesture, gave  some command to the fellow and turned to follow us from the room.    There seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast, and  I hesitated to leave until I had learned the outcome.  It was well I  did so, for the warrior drew an evil looking pistol from its holster  and was on the point of putting an end to the creature when I sprang  forward and struck up his arm.  The bullet striking the wooden casing  of the window exploded, blowing a hole completely through the wood and  masonry.    I then knelt down beside the fearsome-looking thing, and raising it to  its feet motioned for it to follow me.  The looks of surprise which my  actions elicited from the Martians were ludicrous; they could not  understand, except in a feeble and childish way, such attributes as  gratitude and compassion.  The warrior whose gun I had struck up looked  enquiringly at Tars Tarkas, but the latter signed that I be left to my  own devices, and so we returned to the plaza with my great beast  following close at heel, and Sola grasping me tightly by the arm.    I had at least two friends on Mars; a young woman who watched over me  with motherly solicitude, and a dumb brute which, as I later came to  know, held in its poor ugly carcass more love, more loyalty, more  gratitude than could have been found in the entire five million green  Martians who rove the deserted cities and dead sea bottoms of Mars.          CHAPTER VII    CHILD-RAISING ON MARS      After a breakfast, which was an exact replica of the meal of the  preceding day and an index of practically every meal which followed  while I was with the green men of Mars, Sola escorted me to the plaza,  where I found the entire community engaged in watching or helping at  the harnessing of huge mastodonian animals to great three-wheeled  chariots.  There were about two hundred and fifty of these vehicles,  each drawn by a single animal, any one of which, from their appearance,  might easily have drawn the entire wagon train when fully loaded.    The chariots themselves were large, commodious, and gorgeously  decorated.  In each was seated a female Martian loaded with ornaments  of metal, with jewels and silks and furs, and upon the back of each of  the beasts which drew the chariots was perched a young Martian driver.  Like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted, the heavier  draft animals wore neither bit nor bridle, but were guided entirely by  telepathic means.    This power is wonderfully developed in all Martians, and accounts  largely for the simplicity of their language and the relatively few  spoken words exchanged even in long conversations.  It is the universal  language of Mars, through the medium of which the higher and lower  animals of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate to a greater  or less extent, depending upon the intellectual sphere of the species  and the development of the individual.    As the cavalcade took up the line of march in single file, Sola dragged  me into an empty chariot and we proceeded with the procession toward  the point by which I had entered the city the day before.  At the head  of the caravan rode some two hundred warriors, five abreast, and a like  number brought up the rear, while twenty-five or thirty outriders  flanked us on either side.    Every one but myself--men, women, and children--were heavily armed, and  at the tail of each chariot trotted a Martian hound, my own beast  following closely behind ours; in fact, the faithful creature never  left me voluntarily during the entire ten years I spent on Mars.  Our  way led out across the little valley before the city, through the  hills, and down into the dead sea bottom which I had traversed on my  journey from the incubator to the plaza.  The incubator, as it proved,  was the terminal point of our journey this day, and, as the entire  cavalcade broke into a mad gallop as soon as we reached the level  expanse of sea bottom, we were soon within sight of our goal.    On reaching it the chariots were parked with military precision on the  four sides of the enclosure, and half a score of warriors, headed by  the enormous chieftain, and including Tars Tarkas and several other  lesser chiefs, dismounted and advanced toward it.  I could see Tars  Tarkas explaining something to the principal chieftain, whose name, by  the way, was, as nearly as I can translate it into English, Lorquas  Ptomel, Jed; jed being his title.    I was soon appraised of the subject of their conversation, as, calling  to Sola, Tars Tarkas signed for her to send me to him.  I had by this  time mastered "]]]
