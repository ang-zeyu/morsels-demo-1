Isaac then was greatly abashed and  astonied, and marvelled more than can be thought credible. And then he  was in a trance, as the master of histories saith, in which he had  knowledge that God would that Jacob should have the blessing. And said  to Esau: Who then was he that right now a little tofore thy coming  brought to me venison? And I have eaten of all that he brought to me ere  thou camest. I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed. When Esau  heard these words of his father, he cried with a great cry, and was sore  astonied and said: Father, I pray thee bless me also. To whom he said:  Thy brother germain is come fraudulently, and hath received thy  blessing. Then said Esau: Certainly and justly may his name be called  well Jacob, for on another time tofore this he supplanted me of my  patrimony, and now secondly he hath undernome from me my blessing. And  yet then he said to his father: Hast thou not reserved to me one  blessing? Isaac answered: I have ordained him to be thy lord, I have  subdued all his brethren to his servitude. I have stablished him in  wheat, wine and oil. And after this what shall I do to thee, my son? To  whom Esau said: Hast thou not, father, yet one blessing? I beseech thee  to bless me. Then with a great sighing and weeping Isaac moved said to  him: In the fatness of the earth and in the dew of heaven shall be thy  blessing, thou shalt live in thy sword, and shalt serve thy brother.  Then was Esau woebegone, and hated Jacob for supplanting him of his  blessing that his father had blessed him with, and said in his heart:  The days of sorrow shall come to my father, for I shall slay my brother  Jacob. This was told to Rebekah, which anon sent for Jacob her son, and  said to him: Lo! Esau thy brother threateneth to slay thee, therefore  now my son hear my voice and do as I shall counsel. Make thee ready and  go to my brother in Aran, and dwell there with him unto the time that  his anger and fury be overpast, and his indignation ceased, and that he  forget such things that thou hast done to him, and then after that I  shall send for thee, and bring thee hither again. And Rebekah went to  Isaac her husband and said: I am weary of my life because of the  daughters of Heth, if Jacob take to him a wife of that kindred, I will  no longer live. Isaac then called Jacob and blessed him and commanded to  him saying: I charge thee in no wise to take a wife of the kindred of  Canaan, but go and walk into Mesopotamia of Syria, unto the house of  Bethuel, father of thy mother, and take to thee there a wife of the  daughters of Laban thine uncle. God Almighty bless thee, and make thee  grow and multiply, that thou mayst be increased into tourbes of people,  and give to thee the blessings of Abraham, and to thy seed after thee,  that thou mayst possess and own the land of thy pilgrimage which he  granted to thy grandsire. When Isaac had thus said, and given him leave  to go, he departed anon, and went into Mesopotamia of Syria to Laban,  son of Bethuel, brother of Rebekah his mother. Esau seeing that his  father had blessed Jacob and sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria to wed a  wife there, and that after his blessing commanded to him saying: Take  thou no wife of the daughters of Canaan; and he obeying his father went  into Syria, proving thereby that his father saw not gladly the daughters  of Canaan, he went to Ishmael, and took him a wife beside them that he  had taken tofore, that was Melech, daughter of Ishmael, son of Abraham.    Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went forth on his journey toward  Aran. When he came to a certain place after going down of the sun and  would rest there all night, he took of the stones that were there and  laid under his head and slept in the same place. And there he saw in his  sleep a ladder standing on the earth, and the upper end thereof touched  heaven, and angels of God ascending and descending upon it, and our Lord  in the midst of the ladder saying to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham  thy father, and of Isaac; the land on which thou sleepest I shall give  to thee and to thy seed, and thy seed shall be as dust of the earth;  thou shalt spread abroad unto the east and unto the west, and north and  south, and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in thee and in  thy seed. And I shall be thy keeper wheresoever thou shalt go, and shall  bring thee again into this land, and I shall not leave till I have  accomplished all that I have said. When Jacob was awaked from his sleep  and dreaming, he said: Verily God is in this place, and I wist not of  it. And he said dreadingly: How terrible is this place, none other thing  is here but the house of God and the gate of heaven. Then Jacob arose  early and took the stone that lay under his head, and raised it for  witness, pouring oil thereon, and called the name of the place Bethel  which tofore was called Luza. And there he made a vow to our Lord,  saying: If God be with me and keep me in the way that I walk, and give  me bread to eat, and clothes to cover me, and I may return prosperously  into the house of my father, the Lord shall be my God, and this stone  that I have raised in witness, this shall be called the house of God.  And the good of all things that thou givest to me, I shall offer to thee  the tithes and tenth part. Then Jacob went forth into the east, and saw  a pit in a field and three flocks of sheep lying by it, for of that pit  were the beasts watered. And the mouth thereof was shut and closed with  a great stone, for the custom was when all the sheep were gathered, they  rolled away the stone, and when they had drunken they laid the stone  again at the pit mouth. And then he said to the shepherds: Brethren,  whence are ye? Which answered: Of Aran. Then he asking them said: Know  ye not Laban, son of Nahor? They said: We know him well. How fareth he,  said he, is he all whole? He fareth well, said they; and lo! Rachel his  daughter cometh there with her flock. Then said Jacob: It is yet far to  even, it is yet time that the flocks be led to drink, and after be  driven to pasture, which answered: We may not so do till all the beasts  be gathered, and then we remove the stone from the mouth of the pit and  water our beasts. And as they talked, Rachel came with the flock of her  father, for she kept that time the beasts. And when Jacob saw her and  knew that she was his erne's [uncle's] daughter, and that they were his  erne's sheep, he removed the stone from the pit's mouth, and when her  sheep had drunken, he kissed her, and weeping he told her that he was  brother to her father and son of Rebekah. Then she hied her and told it  to her father, which when he understood that Jacob, his sister's son,  was come, he ran against him and, embracing, kissed him, and led him  into his house. And when he had heard the cause of his journey he said:  Thou art my mouth and my flesh.    And when he had been there the space of a month, he demanded Jacob if he  would gladly serve him because he was his cousin, and what hire and  reward he would have. He had two daughters, the more was named Leah, and  the less was called Rachel, but Leah was blear-eyed, and Rachel was fair  of visage and well-favored, whom Jacob loved, and said: I shall serve  thee for Rachel thy younger daughter seven years. Laban answered: It is  better that I give her to thee than to a strange man; dwell and abide  with me, and thou shalt have her. And so Jacob served him for Rachel  seven years, and him thought it but a little while, because of the great  love that he had to her. And at the end of seven years, Jacob said to  Laban: Give to me my wife, for the time is come that I should have her.  Then Laban called all his friends and made a feast for the wedding, and  at night he brought in Leah, the more daughter, and delivered to her an  handmaid named Zilpah. Then Jacob, when the morning came, saw that it  was Leah. He said to Laban her father: What hast thou done? Have I not  served thee for Rachel, why hast thou brought Leah to me? Laban  answered: It is not the usage ne custom of our country to give the  younger first to be wedded, but fulfil and make an end of this marriage  this week, and then shall I give to thee Rachel my daughter for other  seven years that thou shalt serve to me. Jacob agreed gladly, and when  that week was passed, he wedded Rachel to his wife. To whom Laban her  father gave an handmaid named Bilhah. Nevertheless when the wedding of  the younger was finished, because of the great love that he had to her,  him thought that the other seven years were but short.    [And Jacob while he served Laban had these sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi,  Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph.] When  Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban his wives' father: Give me leave to  depart that I may go in to my country and my land; give to me my wives  and children for whom I have served thee that I may go hence. Thou  knowest what service I have served thee. Laban said to him: I have  founden grace in thy sight; I know it by experience that God hath  blessed me for thee; I have ordained the reward that I shall give to  thee. Then Jacob answered: Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how  much thy possession was in my hands. Thou hadst but little when I came  to thee, and now thou art rich, God hath blessed thee at mine entry; it  is now right that I provide somewhat toward mine house. Laban said: What  shall I give to thee? Jacob answered: I will nothing but that thou do  that I demand. I shall yet feed and keep thy beasts, and depart asunder  all the sheep of divers colors. And all that ever shall be of divers  colors and spotty, as well in sheep as in goats, let me have them for my  reward and meed, and Laban granted thereto. Then at time of departing,  Laban took them of two colors, and Jacob them that were of one color.  Thus was Jacob made much rich out of measure, and had many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1039"],[0,"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (#9)"],[1," the country, streams  are pointed out where thousands and thousands of cattle formerly drank,  but in which water now never flows, and where a single herd could not  find fluid for its support.    When Sechele was still a boy, his father, also called Mochoasele, was  murdered by his own people for taking to himself the wives of his  rich under-chiefs. The children being spared, their friends invited  Sebituane, the chief of the Makololo, who was then in those parts, to  reinstate them in the chieftainship. Sebituane surrounded the town  of the Bakwains by night; and just as it began to dawn, his herald  proclaimed in a loud voice that he had come to revenge the death of  Mochoasele. This was followed by Sebituane's people beating loudly on  their shields all round the town. The panic was tremendous, and the rush  like that from a theatre on fire, while the Makololo used their javelins  on the terrified Bakwains with a dexterity which they alone can employ.  Sebituane had given orders to his men to spare the sons of the chief;  and one of them, meeting Sechele, put him in ward by giving him such a  blow on the head with a club as to render him insensible. The usurper  was put to death; and Sechele, reinstated in his chieftainship, felt  much attached to Sebituane. The circumstances here noticed ultimately  led me, as will be seen by-and-by, into the new, well-watered country to  which this same Sebituane had preceded me by many years.    Sechele married the daughters of three of his under-chiefs, who had, on  account of their blood relationship, stood by him in his adversity. This  is one of the modes adopted for cementing the allegiance of a tribe. The  government is patriarchal, each man being, by virtue of paternity, chief  of his own children. They build their huts around his, and the greater  the number of children, the more his importance increases. Hence  children are esteemed one of the greatest blessings, and are always  treated kindly. Near the centre of each circle of huts there is a spot  called a \"kotla\", with a fireplace; here they work, eat, or sit and  gossip over the news of the day. A poor man attaches himself to the  kotla of a rich one, and is considered a child of the latter. An  under-chief has a number of these circles around his; and the collection  of kotlas around the great one in the middle of the whole, that of the  principal chief, constitutes the town. The circle of huts immediately  around the kotla of the chief is composed of the huts of his wives and  those of his blood relations. He attaches the under-chiefs to himself  and his government by marrying, as Sechele did, their daughters, or  inducing his brothers to do so. They are fond of the relationship to  great families. If you meet a party of strangers, and the head man's  relationship to some uncle of a certain chief is not at once proclaimed  by his attendants, you may hear him whispering, \"Tell him who I am.\"  This usually involves a counting on the fingers of a part of his  genealogical tree, and ends in the important announcement that the head  of the party is half-cousin to some well-known ruler.    Sechele was thus seated in his chieftainship when I made his  acquaintance. On the first occasion in which I ever attempted to hold  a public religious service, he remarked that it was the custom of his  nation, when any new subject was brought before them, to put questions  on it; and he begged me to allow him to do the same in this case. On  expressing my entire willingness to answer his questions, he inquired if  my forefathers knew of a future judgment. I replied in the affirmative,  and began to describe the scene of the \"great white throne, and Him who  shall sit on it, from whose face the heaven and earth shall flee away,\"  &c. He said, \"You startle me: these words make all my bones to shake; I  have no more strength in me; but my forefathers were living at the same  time yours were, and how is it that they did not send them word about  these terrible things sooner? They all passed away into darkness  without knowing whither they were going.\" I got out of the difficulty  by explaining the geographical barriers in the North, and the gradual  spread of knowledge from the South, to which we first had access by  means of ships; and I expressed my belief that, as Christ had said,  the whole world would yet be enlightened by the Gospel. Pointing to the  great Kalahari desert, he said, \"You never can cross that country to the  tribes beyond; it is utterly impossible even for us black men, except in  certain seasons, when more than the usual supply of rain falls, and  an extraordinary growth of watermelons follows. Even we who know the  country would certainly perish without them.\" Reasserting my belief  in the words of Christ, we parted; and it will be seen farther on that  Sechele himself assisted me in crossing that desert which had previously  proved an insurmountable barrier to so many adventurers.    As soon as he had an opportunity of learning, he set himself to read  with such close application that, from being comparatively thin, the  effect of having been fond of the chase, he became quite corpulent from  want of exercise. Mr. Oswell gave him his first lesson in figures, and  he acquired the alphabet on the first day of my residence at Chonuane.  He was by no means an ordinary specimen of the people, for I never went  into the town but I was pressed to hear him read some chapters of the  Bible. Isaiah was a great favorite with him; and he was wont to use the  same phrase nearly which the professor of Greek at Glasgow, Sir D.  K. Sandford, once used respecting the Apostle Paul, when reading his  speeches in the Acts: \"He was a fine fellow, that Paul!\" \"He was a fine  man, that Isaiah; he knew how to speak.\" Sechele invariably offered me  something to eat on every occasion of my visiting him.    Seeing me anxious that his people should believe the words of Christ, he  once said, \"Do you imagine these people will ever believe by your merely  talking to them? I can make them do nothing except by thrashing them;  and if you like, I shall call my head men, and with our litupa (whips of  rhinoceros hide) we will soon make them all believe together.\" The idea  of using entreaty and persuasion to subjects to become Christians--whose  opinion on no other matter would he condescend to ask--was especially  surprising to him. He considered that they ought only to be too happy to  embrace Christianity at his command. During the space of two years and  a half he continued to profess to his people his full conviction of the  truth of Christianity; and in all discussions on the subject he took  that side, acting at the same time in an upright manner in all the  relations of life. He felt the difficulties of his situation long before  I did, and often said, \"Oh, I wish you had come to this country before  I became entangled in the meshes of our customs!\" In fact, he could not  get rid of his superfluous wives, without appearing to be ungrateful to  their parents, who had done so much for him in his adversity.    In the hope that others would be induced to join him in his attachment  to Christianity, he asked me to begin family worship with him in  his house. I did so; and by-and-by was surprised to hear how well he  conducted the prayer in his own simple and beautiful style, for he was  quite a master of his own language. At this time we were suffering from  the effects of a drought, which will be described further on, and none  except his family, whom he ordered to attend, came near his meeting.  \"In former times,\" said he, \"when a chief was fond of hunting, all  his people got dogs, and became fond of hunting too. If he was fond of  dancing or music, all showed a liking to these amusements too. If the  chief loved beer, they all rejoiced in strong drink. But in this case  it is different. I love the Word of God, and not one of my brethren will  join me.\" One reason why we had no volunteer hypocrites was the hunger  from drought, which was associated in their minds with the presence of  Christian instruction; and hypocrisy is not prone to profess a creed  which seems to insure an empty stomach.    Sechele continued to make a consistent profession for about three years;  and perceiving at last some of the difficulties of his case, and also  feeling compassion for the poor women, who were by far the best of our  scholars, I had no desire that he should be in any hurry to make a  full profession by baptism, and putting away all his wives but one. His  principal wife, too, was about the most unlikely subject in the tribe  ever to become any thing else than an out-and-out greasy disciple of  the old school. She has since become greatly altered, I hear, for the  better; but again and again have I seen Sechele send her out of church  to put her gown on, and away she would go with her lips shot out, the  very picture of unutterable disgust at his new-fangled notions.    When he at last applied for baptism, I simply asked him how he, having  the Bible in his hand, and able to read it, thought he ought to act. He  went home, gave each of his superfluous wives new clothing, and all his  own goods, which they had been accustomed to keep in their huts for him,  and sent them to their parents with an intimation that he had no fault  to find with them, but that in parting with them he wished to follow  the will of God. On the day on which he and his children were baptized,  great numbers came to see the ceremony. Some thought, from a stupid  calumny circulated by enemies to Christianity in the south, that the  converts would be made to drink an infusion of \"dead men's brains\",  and were astonished to find that water only was used at baptism. Seeing  several of the old men actually in tears during the service, I asked  them afterward the cause of their weeping; they were crying to see their  father, as the Scotch remark over a case of suicide, \"S"]]]
