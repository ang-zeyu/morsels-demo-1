He was tied to a tree, the surrounding wood was set on fire, and he was  abandoned to his fate, his enemies leaving him to destruction in their  haste to reach the place of the council and slay or capture all who were  there. Hardly were they out of hearing ere the plash of a paddle sounded  through the roar of flame and Maya sprang upon the bank, cut her lover's  bonds, and with him made toward the island, which they reached by a  protected way before the assailants had arrived. They told the story of  Joliper's cruelty and treason, and when his boats were seen coming in to  shore they had eyes and hands only for Joliper. He was the first to land.  Hardly had he touched the strand before he was surrounded by a frenzied  crowd and had fallen bleeding from a hundred gashes.    The Indians were overpowered after a brief and bloody resistance. They  took safety in flight. Omoyao and Maya, climbing upon the rock above  their \"council chamber,\" found that while most of their people had  escaped their own retreat was cut off, and that it would be impossible to  reach any of the canoes. They preferred death to torture and captivity,  so, hand in hand, they leaped together down the cliff, and the English  claimed the land next day.          NIAGARA    The cataract of Niagara (properly pronounced Nee-ah-gah-rah), or  Oniahgarah, is as fatal as it is fascinating, beautiful, sublime, and the  casualties occurring there justify the tradition that \"the Thundering  Water asks two victims every year.\" It was reputed, before white men  looked for the first time on these falls--and what thumping yarns they  told about them!--that two lives were lost here annually, and this  average has been kept up by men and women who fall into the flood through  accident, recklessness or despair, while bloody battles have been fought  on the shores, and vessels have been hurled over the brink, to be dashed  to splinters on the rocks.    The sound of the cataract was declared to be the voice of a mighty spirit  that dwelt in the waters, and in former centuries the Indians offered to  it a yearly sacrifice. This sacrifice was a maiden of the tribe, who was  sent over in a white canoe, decorated with fruit and flowers, and the  girls contended for this honor, for the brides of Manitou were objects of  a special grace in the happy hunting-grounds. The last recorded sacrifice  was in 1679, when Lelawala, the daughter of chief Eagle Eye, was chosen,  in spite of the urgings and protests of the chevalier La Salle, who had  been trying to restrain the people from their idolatries by an exposition  of the Christian dogma. To his protests he received the unexpected  answer, \"Your words witness against you. Christ, you say, set us an  example. We will follow it. Why should one death be great, while our  sacrifice is horrible?\" So the tribe gathered at the bank to watch the  sailing of the white canoe. The chief watched the embarkation with the  stoicism usual to the Indian when he is observed by others, but when the  little bark swung out into the current his affection mastered him, and he  leaped into his own canoe and tried to overtake his daughter. In a moment  both were beyond the power of rescue. After their death they were changed  into spirits of pure strength and goodness, and live in a crystal heaven  so far beneath the fall that its roaring is a music to them: she, the  maid of the mist; he, the ruler of the cataract. Another version of the  legend makes a lover and his mistress the chief actors. Some years later  a patriarch of the tribe and all his sons went over the fall when the  white men had seized their lands, preferring death to flight or war.    In about the year 200 the Stone Giants waded across the river below the  falls on their northward march. These beings were descended from an  ancient family, and being separated from their stock in the year 150 by  the breaking of a vine bridge across the Mississippi, they left that  region. Indian Pass, in the Adirondacks, bore the names of Otneyarheh,  Stony Giants; Ganosgwah, Giants Clothed in Stone; and Dayohjegago, Place  Where the Storm Clouds Fight the Great Serpent. Giants and serpents were  held to be harmful inventions of the Evil Spirit, and the Lightning god,  catching up clouds as he stood on the crags, broke them open, tore their  lightnings out and hurled them against the monsters. These cannibals had  almost exterminated the Iroquois, for they were of immense size and had  made themselves almost invincible by rolling daily in the sand until  their flesh was like stone. The Holder of the Heavens, viewing their evil  actions from on high, came down disguised as one of their number--he used  often to meditate on Manitou Rock, at the Whirlpool--and leading them to  a valley near Onondaga, on pretence of guiding them to a fairer country,  he stood on a hill above them and hurled rocks upon their heads until  all, save one, who fled into the north, were dead. Yet, in the fulness of  time, new children of the Stone Giants (mail-clad Europeans?) entered the  region again and were destroyed by the Great Spirit,--oddly enough where  the famous fraud known as the Cardiff giant was alleged to have been  found. The Onondagas believed this statue to be one of their ancient  foes.          THE DEFORMED OF ZOAR    The valley of Zoar, in western New York, is so surrounded by hills that  its discoverers--a religious people, who gave it a name from Scripture  said, \"This is Zoar; it is impregnable. From her we will never go.\" And  truly, for lack of roads, they found it so hard to get out, having got  in, that they did not leave it. Among the early settlers here were people  of a family named Wright, whose house became a sort of inn for the  infrequent traveller, inasmuch as they were not troubled with piety, and  had no scruples against the selling of drink and the playing of cards at  late hours. A peddler passed through the valley on his way to Buffalo and  stopped at the Wright house for a lodging, but before he went to bed he  incautiously showed a number of golden trinkets from his pack and drew a  considerable quantity of money out of his pocket when he paid the fee for  his lodging. Hardly had he fallen asleep before his greedy hosts were in  the room, searching for his money. Their lack of caution caused him to  awake, and as he found them rifling his pockets and his pack he sprang up  and showed fight.    A blow sent him to the bottom of the stairs, where his attempt to escape  was intercepted, and the family closed around him and bound his arms and  legs. They showed him the money they had taken and asked where he had  concealed the rest. He vowed that it was all he had. They insisted that  he had more, and seizing a knife from the table the elder Wright slashed  off one of his toes \"to make him confess.\" No result came from this, and  six toes were cut off,--three from each foot; then, in disgust, the  unhappy peddler was knocked on the head and flung through a trap-door  into a shallow cellar. Presently he arose and tried to draw himself out,  but with hatchet and knife they chopped away his fingers and he fell  back. Even the women shared in this work, and leaned forward to gaze into  the cellar to see if he might yet be dead. While listening, they heard  the man invoke the curse of heaven on them: he asked that they should  wear the mark of crime even to the fourth generation, by coming into the  world deformed and mutilated as he was then. And it was so. The next  child born in that house had round, hoof-like feet, with only two toes,  and hands that tapered from the wrist into a single long finger. And in  time there were twenty people so deformed in the valley: The \"crab-clawed  Zoarites\" they were called.          HORSEHEADS    The feeling recently created by an attempt to fasten the stupid names of  Fairport or of North Elmira on the village in central New York that, off  and on for fifty years, had been called Horseheads, caused an inquiry as  to how that singular name chanced to be adopted for a settlement. In  1779, when General Sullivan was retiring toward the base of his supplies  after a destructive campaign against the Indians in Genesee County, he  stopped near this place and rested his troops. The country was then rude,  unbroken, and still beset with enemies, however, and when the march was  resumed it was thought best to gain time over a part of the way by  descending the Chemung River on rafts.    As there were no appliances for building large floats, and the depth of  the water was not known, the general ordered a destruction of all  impedimenta that could be got rid of, and commanded that the poor and  superfluous horses should be killed. His order was obeyed. As soon as the  troops had gone, the wolves, that were then abundant, came forth and  devoured the carcasses of the steeds, so that the clean-picked bones were  strewn widely over the camp-ground. When the Indians ventured back into  this region, some of them piled the skulls of the horses into heaps, and  these curious monuments were found by white settlers who came into the  valley some years later, and who named their village Horseheads, in  commemoration of these relics. The Indians were especially loth to leave  this region, for their tradition was that it had been the land of the  Senecas from immemorial time, the tribe being descended from a couple  that had a home on a hill near Horseheads.          KAYUTA AND WANETA    The Indians loved our lakes. They had eyes for their beauty, and to them  they were abodes of gracious spirits. They used to say of Oneida Lake,  that when the Great Spirit formed the world \"his smile rested on its  waters and Frenchman's Island rose to greet it; he laughed and Lotus  Island came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#8)"],[1,"second he could enter the  tower; the third was heard as he led Riminild forth. Lightly did he  clasp her round the waist and swing her into his boat, and then pulled  for the ship.    He brought Riminild on board his ship, and called to his band, \"Ho  there, my trusty eleven! Our voyage is ended, and we will now go merrily  home. And you, Athulf, my chosen and tried friend, shall now have your  guerdon; I will bring you to your bride Swanhild, and Riminild and I  will be wedded at the same time--the same wedding feast shall serve us  both.    \"And Riminild, my sweet pearl, whom I have rescued from the deep, not  all that I have suffered on your account grieves me like the perfidy  this false one wrought on you, my loving heart. Through him the goodly  tale of my twelve followers is broken; now when they gather round the  table, one seat will ever be empty. Must it ever be that no dozen of men  can be got together but one will prove a traitor?\"    Then he bade them \"Set the traitor in the boat and let it drift out to  sea, as we poor children were made to do aforetime. Let the waves bear  away treachery as once they bore innocence--our ship will make better  speed; and as for him, let him drift till he find a land where no  traitors are.\"          CHAPTER IV    SIR GALAHAD        My good blade carves the casques of men,      My tough lance thrusteth sure,    My strength is as the strength of ten,      Because my heart is pure.    The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,      The hard brands shiver on the steel,    The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,      The horse and rider reel:    They reel, they roll in changing lists,      And when the tide of combat stands,    Perfume and flowers fall in showers,      That lightly rain from ladies' hands.      How sweet are looks that ladies bend      On whom their favours fall!    For them I battle till the end,      To save from shame and thrall:    But all my heart is drawn above,      My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine:    I never felt the kiss of love,      Nor maiden's hand in mine.    More bounteous aspects on me beam,      Me mightier transports move and thrill;    So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer      A virgin heart in work and will.      When down the stormy crescent goes,      A light before me swims,    Between dark stems the forest glows,      I hear a noise of hymns:    Then by some secret shrine I ride;      I hear a voice but none are there;    The stalls are void, the doors are wide,      The tapers burning fair.    Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,      The silver vessels sparkle clean,    The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,      And solemn chaunts resound between.      Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres      I find a magic bark;    I leap on board: no helmsman steers:      I float till all is dark.    A gentle sound, an awful light!      Three angels bear the Holy Grail:    With folded feet, in stoles of white,      On sleeping wings they sail.    Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!      My spirit beats her mortal bars,    As down dark tides the glory slides,      And star-like mingles with the stars.      When on my goodly charger borne      Thro' dreaming towns I go,    The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,      The streets are dumb with snow.    The tempest crackles on the leads,      And, ringing, spins from brand and mail;    But o'er the dark a glory spreads,      And gilds the driving hail.      I leave the plain, I climb the height;      No branchy thicket shelter yields;    But blessed forms in whistling storms      Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.      A maiden knight--to me is given      Such hope, I know not fear;    I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven      That often meet me here.    I muse on joy that will not cease,      Pure spaces clothed in living beams,    Pure lilies of eternal peace,      Whose odors haunt my dreams;    And, stricken by an angel's hand,      This mortal armour that I wear,    This weight and size, this heart and eyes,      Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air.      The clouds are broken in the sky,      And thro' the mountain-walls    A rolling organ-harmony      Swells up, and shakes and falls.    Then move the trees, the copses nod,      Wings flutter, voices hover clear:    \"O just and faithful knight of God!      Ride on! the prize is near.\"    So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;      By bridge and ford, by park and pale,    All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,      Until I find the Holy Grail.          CHAPTER V    RUSTEM AND SOHRAB      Give ear unto the combat of Sohrab against Rustem, though it be a tale  replete with tears.    It came about that on a certain day Rustem arose from his couch, and his  mind was filled with forebodings. He bethought him therefore to go out  to the chase. So he saddled Rakush and made ready his quiver with  arrows. Then he turned him unto the wilds that lie near Turan, even in  the direction of the city of Samengan. And when he was come nigh unto  it, he started a herd of asses and made sport among them till that he  was weary of the hunt. Then he caught one and slew it and roasted it for  his meal, and when he had eaten it and broken the bones for the marrow,  he laid himself down to slumber, and Rakush cropped the pasture beside  him.    Now while the hero was sleeping there passed by seven knights of Turan,  and they beheld Rakush and coveted him. So they threw their cords at him  to ensnare him. But Rakush, when he beheld their design, pawed the  ground in anger, and fell upon them as he had fallen upon the lion. And  of one man he bit off the head, and another he struck down under his  hoofs, and he would have overcome them all, but they were too many. So  they ensnared him and led him into the city, thinking in their hearts,  \"Verily a goodly capture have we made.\" But Rustem when he awoke from  his slumbers was downcast and sore grieved when he saw not his steed,  and he said unto himself:    \"How can I stand against the Turks, and how can I traverse the desert  alone?\"    And his heart was full of trouble. Then he sought for the traces of the  horse's hoofs, and followed them, and they led him even unto the gates  of the city. Now when those within beheld Rustem, and that he came  before them on foot, the King and the nobles came forth to greet him,  and inquired of him how this was come about. Then Rustem told them how  Rakush was vanished while he slumbered, and how he had followed his  track even unto these gates. And he sware a great oath, and vowed that  if his courser were not restored unto him many heads should quit their  trunks. Then the King of Samengan, when he saw that Rustem was beside  himself with anger, spoke words of soothing, and said that none of his  people should do wrong unto the hero; and he begged him that he would  enter into his house and abide with him until that search had been made,  saying:    \"Surely Rakush cannot be hid.\"    And Rustem was satisfied at these words, and cast suspicion from his  spirit, and entered the house of the King, and feasted with him, and  beguiled the hours with wine. And the King rejoiced in his guest, and  encompassed him with sweet singers and all honour. And when the night  was fallen the King himself led Rustem unto a couch perfumed with musk  and roses, and he bade him slumber sweetly until the morning. And he  declared to him yet again that all was well for him and for his steed.    Now when a portion of the night was spent, and the star of morning stood  high in the arch of heaven, the door of Rustem's chamber was opened, and  a murmur of soft voices came in from the threshold. And there stepped  within a slave bearing a lamp perfumed with amber, and a woman whose  beauty was veiled came after her. And as she moved musk was scattered  from her robes. And the women came nigh unto the bed of the hero heavy  with wine and slumber. And he was amazed when he saw them. And when he  had roused him somewhat he spake and said:    \"Who are thou, and what is thy name and thy desire, and what seekest  thou from me in the dark night?\"    Then the Peri-faced answered him, saying, \"I am Tahmineh, the daughter  of the King of Samengan, the race of the leopard and the lion, and none  of the princes of this earth are worthy of my hand, neither hath any man  seen me unveiled. But my heart is torn with anguish, and my spirit is  tossed with desire, for I have heard of thy deeds of prowess, and how  thou fearest neither Deev nor lion, neither leopard nor crocodile, and  how thy hand is swift to strike, and how thou didst venture alone into  Mazinderan, and how wild asses are devoured of thee, and how the earth  groaneth under the tread of thy feet, and how men perish at thy blows,  and how even the eagle dareth not swoop down upon her prey when she  beholdeth thy sword. These things and more have they told unto me, and  mine eyes have yearned to look upon thy face. And now hath God brought  thee within the gates of my father, and I am come to say unto thee that  I am thine if thou wilt hear me, and if thou wilt not, none other will I  espouse. And consider, O Pehliva, how that love has obscured mine  understanding and withdrawn me from the bosom of discretion, yet  peradventure God will grant unto me a son like to thee for strength and  valour, to whom shall be given the empire of the world. And if thou wilt  listen unto me, I will lead forth before thee Rakush thy steed, and I  will place under thy feet the land of Samengan.\"    Now while this moon of beauty was yet speaking, Rustem regarded her. And  he saw that she was fair, and that wisdom abode in her mind; and when he  heard of Rakush, his spirit was decided within him, and he held that  this adventure could not end save gloriously. So he sent a Mubid unto  the King and demanded the hand of Tahmineh from her father. And the  King, when he heard the news, was rejoiced, and gave his daughter unto  the Pehliva, and they concluded an alliance"]]]
