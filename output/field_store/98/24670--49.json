EDWARD DRINKER.      Edward Drinker was born in a cottage in 1689, on the spot where the city  of Philadelphia now stands, which was inhabited at the time of his  birth, by Indians, a few Swedes, and Hollanders. He often talked of  picking blackberries, and catching wild rabbits, where this populous  city is now seated. He remembered William Penn arriving there the second  time, and used to point out the spot where the cabin stood in which Mr.  Penn and his friends were accommodated on their arrival.    The life of this aged citizen is marked with circumstances which never  befel any other man; for he saw greater events than any man, at least,  since the Patriarchs. He saw the same spot of earth, in the course of  his own life, covered with woods and bushes, the receptacles of wild  beasts and birds of prey, afterwards become the seat of a great city,  not only the first in wealth and arts in America, but equalled by few in  Europe; he saw great and regular streets, where he had often pursued  hares and wild rabbits; he saw fine churches rise upon morasses, where  he used to hear nothing but the croaking of frogs; great wharfs and  warehouses, where he had so often seen the Indian savages draw their  fish from the river; and that river afterwards full of great ships from  all the world, which in his youth had nothing bigger than a canoe; and  on the same spot, where he had so often gathered huckleberries, he saw  their magnificent city hall erected, and that hall filled with  legislators, astonishing the world with their wisdom and virtue. He also  saw the first treaty ratified between the united powers of America, and  the most powerful prince in Europe, with all the formality of parchment  and seal; and on the same spot where he once saw William Penn ratify his  first and last treaty with the Indians; and to conclude, he saw the  beginning and end of the British empire in Pensylvania. He had been the  subject of many crowned heads; but when he heard of the many oppressive  and unconstitutional acts passed in Britain, he bought them all, and  gave them to his great grandson to make kites of; and embracing the  liberty and independence of his country in his withered arms, and  triumphing in the last year of his life, in the salvation of his  country. He died on the 17th of November, 1782, aged 103 years.      A SURE SIGN.

The city,  however, by making various presents to the king, and rendering him other  signal services, found means to have their charter restored.             *       *       *       *       *      _Dr. E.

She opened her eyes and her heart and smiled at her brother.    \"There's no set of Scott in the house. I'm going to give Terry one.\"    \"Do you think he'll ever read the novels? I never could. That antiquated  style, Vance, keeps me at arm's length.\"    \"A stiff style because he wrote so rapidly. But there's the greatest body  and bone of character. Except for his heroes. Terry reminds me of them,  in a way. No thought, not very much feeling, but a great capacity for  physical action.\"    \"I think you'd like to be Terry's adviser,\" she said.    \"I wouldn't aspire to the job,\" yawned Vance, \"unless I could ride well  and shoot well. If a man can't do that, he ceases to be a man in Terry's  eyes. And if a woman can't talk pure English, she isn't a woman.\"    \"That's because he's young,\" said Elizabeth.    \"It's because he's a prig,\" sneered Vance. He had been drawn farther into  the conversation than he planned; now he retreated carefully. \"But  another year or so may help him.\"    He retreated before she could answer, but he left her thoughtful, as he  hoped to do. He had a standing theory that the only way to make a woman  meditate is to keep her from talking. And he wanted very much to make  Elizabeth meditate the evil in the son of Black Jack. Otherwise all his  plans might be useless and his seeds of destruction fall on barren soil.  He was intensely afraid of that, anyway. His hope was to draw the boy and  the sheriff together on the birthday and guide the two explosives until  they met on the subject of the death of Black Jack. Either Terry would  kill the sheriff, or the sheriff would kill Terry. Vance hoped for the  latter, but rather expected the former to be the outcome, and if it were,  he was inclined to think that Elizabeth would sooner or later make  excuses for Terry and take him back into the fold of her affections.  Accordingly, his work was, in the few days that intervened, to plant all  the seeds of suspicion that he could. Then, when the denouement came,  those seeds might blossom overnight into poison flowers.    In the late afternoon he took up his position in an easy chair on the big  veranda. The mail was delivered, as a rule, just before dusk, one of the  cow-punchers riding down for it. Grave fears about the loss of that all-  important missive to Terry haunted him, for the postmaster was a  doddering old fellow who was quite apt to forget his head. Consequently  he was vastly relieved when the mail arrived and Elizabeth brought the  familiar big envelope out to him, with its typewritten address.    \"Looks like a business letter, doesn't it?\" she asked Vance.    \"More or less,\" said Vance, covering a yawn of excitement.    \"But how on earth could any business--it's postmarked from Craterville.\"    \"Somebody may have heard about his prospects; they're starting early to  separate him from his money.\"    \"Vance, how much talking did you do in Craterville?\"    It was hard to meet her keen old eyes.    \"Too much, I'm afraid,\" he said frankly. \"You see, I've felt rather  touchy about the thing. I want people to know that you and I have agreed  on making Terry the heir to the ranch. I don't want anyone to suspect  that we differed. I suppose I talked too much about the birthday plans.\"    She sighed with vexation and weighed the letter in her hand.    \"I've half a mind to open it.\"    His heartbeat fluttered and paused.    \"Go ahead,\" he urged, with well-assured carelessness.    She shook down the contents of the envelope preparatory to opening it.    \"It's nothing but printed stuff, Vance. I can see that, through the  envelope.\"    \"But wait a minute, Elizabeth. It might anger Terry to have even his  business mail opened. He's touchy, you know.\"    She hesitated, then shrugged her shoulders.    \"I suppose you're right. Let it go.\" She laughed at her own concern over  the matter. \"Do you know, Vance, that sometimes I feel as if the whole  world were conspiring to get a hand on Terry?\"        CHAPTER 8      Terry did not come down for dinner. It was more or less of a calamity,  for the board was quite full of early guests for the next day's  festivities. Aunt Elizabeth shifted the burden of the entertainment onto  the capable shoulders of Vance, who could please these Westerners when he  chose. Tonight he decidedly chose. Elizabeth had never see him in such  high spirits. He could flirt good-humoredly and openly across the table  at Nelly, or else turn and draw an anecdote from Nelly's father. He kept  the reins in his hands and drove the talk along so smoothly that  Elizabeth could sit in gloomy silence, unnoticed, at the farther end of  the table. Her mind was up yonder in the room of Terry.    Something had happened, and it had come through that long business  envelope with the typewritten address that seemed so harmless. One  reading of the contents had brought Terry out of his chair with an  exclamation. Then, without explanation of any sort, he had gone to his  room and stayed there. She would have followed to find out what was the  matter, but the requirements of dinner and her guests kept her  downstairs.    Immediately after dinner Vance, at a signal from her, dexterously herded  everyone into the living room and distributed them in comfort around the  big fireplace; Elizabeth Cornish bolted straight for the room of Terence.  She knocked and tried the door. To her astonishment, the knob turned, but  the door did not open. She heard the click and felt the jar of the bolt.  Terry had locked his door!    A little thing to make her heart fall, one would say, but little things  about Terry were great things to Elizabeth. In twenty-four years he had  never locked his door. What could it mean?    It was a moment before she could call, and she waited breathlessly. She  was reassured by a quiet voice that answered her: \"Just a moment. I'll  open.\"    The tone was so matter-of-fact that her heart, with one leap, came back  to normal and tears of relief misted her eyes for an instant. Perhaps he  was up here working out a surprise for the next day--he was full of  tricks and surprises. That was unquestionably it. And he took so long in  coming to the door because he was hiding the thing he had been working  on. As for food, Wu Chi was his slave and would have smuggled a tray up  to him. Presently the lock turned and the door opened.    She could not see his face distinctly at first, the light was so strong  behind him. Besides, she was more occupied in looking for the tray of  food which would assure her that Terry was not suffering from some mental  crisis that had made him forget even dinner. She found the tray, sure  enough, but the food had not been touched.    She turned on him with a new rush of alarm. And all her fears were  realized. Terry had been fighting a hard battle and he was still  fighting. About his eyes there was the look, half-dull and half-hard,  that comes in the eyes of young people unused to pain. A worried, tense,  hungry face. He took her arm and led her to the table. On it lay an  article clipped out of a magazine. She looked down at it with unseeing  eyes. The sheets were already much crumbled. Terry turned them to a full-  page picture, and Elizabeth found herself looking down into the face of  Black Jack, proud, handsome, defiant.    Had Vance been there, he might have recognized her actions. As she had  done one day twenty-four years ago, now she turned and dropped heavily  into a chair, her bony hands pressed to her shallow bosom. A moment later  she was on her feet again, ready to fight, ready to tell a thousand lies.  But it was too late. The revelation had been complete and she could tell  by his face that Terence knew everything.    \"Terry,\" she said faintly, \"what on earth have you to do with that--\"    \"Listen, Aunt Elizabeth,\" he said, \"you aren't going to fib about it, are  you?\"    \"What in the world are you talking about?\"    \"Why were you so shocked?\"    She knew it was a futile battle. He was prying at her inner mind with  short questions and a hard, dry voice.    \"It was the face of that terrible man. I saw him once before, you know.  On the day--\"    \"On the day he was murdered!\"    That word told her everything. \"Murdered!\" It lighted all the mental  processes through which he had been going. Who in all the reaches of the  mountain desert had ever before dreamed of terming the killing of the  notorious Black Jack a \"murder\"?    \"What are you saying, Terence? That fellow--\"    \"Hush! Look at us!\"    He picked up the photograph and stood back so that the light fell sharply  on his face and on the photograph which he held beside his head. He  caught up a sombrero and jammed it jauntily on his head. He tilted his  face high, with resolute chin. And all at once there were two Black  Jacks, not one. He evidently saw all the admission that he cared for in  her face. He took off the hat with a dragging motion and replaced the  photograph on the table.    \"I tried it in the mirror,\" he said quietly. \"I wasn't quite sure until I  tried it in the mirror. Then I knew, of course.\"    She felt him slipping out of her life.    \"What shall I say to you, Terence?\"    \"Is that my real name?\"    She winced. \"Yes. Your real name.\"    \"Good. Do you remember our talk of today?\"    \"What talk?\"    He drew his breath with something of a groan.    \"I said that what these people lacked was the influence of family--of old  blood!\"    He made himself smile at her, and Elizabeth trembled. \"If I could  explain--\" she began.    \"Ah, what is there to explain, Aunt Elizabeth? Except that you have been  a thousand times kinder to me than I dreamed before. Why, I--I actually  thought that you were rather honored by having a Colby under your roof. I  really felt that I was bestowing something of a favor on you!\"    \"Terry, sit down!\"    He sank"]]]
