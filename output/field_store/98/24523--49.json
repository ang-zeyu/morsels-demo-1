Joseph then said, 'Well, I will write the revelation and  we will see.' He then requested me to get paper and prepare to write.  Hyrum very urgently requested Joseph to write the revelation by means  of the Urim and Thummim, but Joseph in reply, said he did not need to,  for he knew the revelation perfectly from beginning to end.    \"Joseph and Hyrum then sat down and Joseph commenced to dictate the  revelation on celestial marriage, and I wrote it, sentence by sentence,  as he dictated. After the whole was written, Joseph asked me to read  it through, slowly and carefully, which I did, and he pronounced it  correct. He then remarked that there was much more that he could  {XXXIII} write on the same subject, but what was written was sufficient  for the present.    \"Hyrum then took the revelation to read to Emma. Joseph remained with  me in the office until Hyrum returned. When he came back, Joseph asked  him how he had succeeded. Hyrum replied that he had never received a  more severe talking to in his life, that Emma was very bitter and full  of resentment and anger.    \"Joseph quietly remarked, 'I told you, you did not know Emma as well  as I did.' Joseph then put the revelation in his pocket, and they both  left the office.    \"The revelation was read to several of the authorities during the day.  Towards evening Bishop Newel K. Whitney asked Joseph if he had any  objections to his taking a copy of the revelation; Joseph replied that  he had not, and handed it to him. It was carefully copied the following  day by Joseph C. Kingsbury. Two or three days after the revelation  was written Joseph related to me and several others that Emma had so  teased, and urgently entreated him for the privilege of destroying  it, that he became so weary of her teasing, and to get rid of her  annoyance, he told her she might destroy it and she had done so, but he  had consented to her wish in this matter to pacify her, realizing that  he knew the revelation perfectly, and could rewrite it at any time if  necessary.    \"The copy made by Joseph C. Kingsbury is a true and correct copy of the  original in every respect. The copy was carefully preserved by Bishop  Whitney, and but few knew of its existence until the temporary location  of the Camps of Israel at Winter Quarters, on the Missouri River, in  1846. * * * * *    (Signed) \"WM. CLAYTON.    \"Salt Lake City, Feb. 16th, 1874.\"    On May 22, 1886, Joseph C. Kingsbury made the following statement  before Charles W. Stayner, a notary public, in Salt Lake City:    \"In reference to the affidavit of Elder William Clayton, on the  subject of the celestial order of patriarchal marriage, published in  the _Deseret Evening News_ of May 20th, 1886, and particularly as to  the statement made therein concerning myself, as having copied the  original revelation written by Brother Clayton at the dictation of the  Prophet Joseph, I will say that Bishop Newel K. Whitney, handed me the  revelation above referred to either on the day it was written or the  day following, and stating what it was, asked me to take a copy of it.  I did so, and then read my copy of it to Bishop Whitney, we compared it  with the original which he held in his hand while I read to him. When I  had finished reading, Bishop Whitney pronounced the copy correct, and  Hyrum Smith coming into the room at the time to fetch the original,  Bishop Whitney handed it to him. I will also state that this copy, as  {XXXIV} also the original are identically the same as that published in  the present edition [1886] of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.    \"I will add that I also knew that the Prophet Joseph Smith had married  other women besides his first wife, Emma; I was well aware of the  fact of his having married Sarah Ann Whitney, the eldest daughter of  Bishop Newel K. Whitney and Elizabeth Ann Whitney, his wife. And the  Prophet Joseph told me personally that he had married other women, in  accordance with the revealed will of God, and spoke concerning the  principle as being a command of God for holy purposes.    (Signed) \"JOSEPH C. KINGSBURY.\"    II.    _Authorship of the Revelation_.    In addition to the testimony of these affidavits as to the authorship  of the revelation, and many more on file in the Church Historian's  office, equally positive and unimpeachable, which might be quoted,  there is another sort of evidence as to the authorship, not before  used, so far as I know, to which I desire to appeal, and which is even  more certain and convincing on this subject than the testimony of any  affidavit by whomsoever given. I refer to the internal evidence that  Joseph Smith, under the inspiration of God, of course, is the author  of it. The revelation carries with it so many characteristics of his  style found in other revelations given through him, that to doubt his  authorship of it is impossible. Let us consider these characteristics.    _1. The Revelation Was Given in Answer to the Prophet's Inquiry--A  Characteristic of Nearly All His Revelations_.    The revelation was given in answer to the Prophet's inquiries upon one  branch of the subject of which it treats, _viz_., the justification  of some of the Bible Patriarchs and Prophets in having a plurality of  wives. It is so generally the case that the revelations the Prophet  received came in response to inquiries either by himself or by those  who sought to learn their duty or to know some truth, that such  inquiries may be considered as a condition precedent to his receiving  revelations; at any rate it is plainly a characteristic of the whole  volume of revelations which Joseph Smith gave to the world.    The Prophet's first revelation, the one respecting the errancy of  the religious world, accompanied as it was by a full view of God the  Father, and God the Son, was received in answer to a most earnest  inquiry to know what course he should pursue in the midst of the  religious confusion then existing--which church should he join.  (History of the Church, Vol. I, chapt. 1.)    The first of that series of meetings with the angel Moroni, which  {XXXV} finally resulted in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, was  brought about through the Prophet asking for a spiritual manifestation  from the Lord, that he might know of his \"state and standing before  Him.\" (History of the Church, Vol. I, chapt. 2).    The series of revelations given during the time the Book of Mormon was  in course of translation were chiefly given in response to inquiries  on the part of the persons who came to the Prophet seeking to know the  will of the Lord with reference to the relationship they should assume  towards the work then coming forth. See Doc. and Cov., Sec. 10; History  of the Church, Vol. I, p. 23, also pp. 28-33, 36, 45, 48, 49, 51, 53.  These revelations are found in the Doc. and Cov., Sec. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17.    The revelation authorizing the organization of the Church and outlining  that organization and some of the fundamental doctrines of the Church  (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 20), was given in answer to most earnest inquiry  as to how the Prophet and his associates should proceed with the work  of organization. \"We had for some time made this matter a subject of  humble prayer,\" writes the Prophet, \"and at length we got together  in the chamber of Mr. Whitmer's house, in order more particularly to  seek of the Lord what we now so earnestly desired; and here to our  unspeakable satisfaction, did we realize the truth of the Savior's  promise, 'ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;  knock, and it shall be opened unto you'--for we had not long been  engaged in solemn and fervent prayer, when the word of the Lord came to  us in the chamber.\" (History of the Church, chapt. 7.) Then follows the  revelation on Church organization and doctrine.    I may say that all the great revelations of the Church, as well as  those which might be regarded as merely personal, were received in  response to earnest inquiries of the Lord. Thus the revelation which  in 1831 was regarded as making known the moral law of the Gospel was  received after earnest inquiry. (History of the Church, Vol. I, p.  148; Doc. and Cov., Sec. 42, par. 3.) So also the great revelation on  priesthood. (History of the Church, Vol. I, p. 287; Doc. and Cov.,  Sec. 84.) The great revelation on the order of the priesthood and  the relations of the quorums to each other was given in response to  a formal and very earnest petition on the part of the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles. (History of the Church, Vol. II, pp. 219, 220; Doc.  and Cov., Sec. 107.) So also as to the revelation on tithing and the  disposition of it. (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 119, 120; History of the  Church, Vol. III, p. 44.) So the great revelation setting in order the  affairs of the Church at Nauvoo, given January 19, 1841. \"Your prayers  are acceptable before me,\" said the Lord to the Prophet, \"and in answer  to them I say unto you,\" then continues that great revelation. (Doc.  and Cov., Sec. 124: 2.) In {XXXVI} fact, to particularize no further,  it may be said that by far the greater number of the revelations  received by the Prophet were in response to his petitions and inquiries  of the Lord; and therefore the fact that this revelation on marriage  was given in response to inquiries by the Prophet, to know why the Lord  justified the worthy patriarchs named, and some of the prophets, in  their plural marriage relations, is characteristic of practically all  the revelations received by him.    _2. It Possesses the Characteristic of Frankness in Reproving the  Prophet_.    Another characteristic of the Prophet Joseph's revelations is the  frankness with which the Prophet himself is reproved for his follies  and transgressions of the counsels of the Lord. He is never shielded;  never justified when he steps aside from the path direct; reproof,  chastisement and warnings are administered to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60758"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 6 (#8)"],[1," not definitely pledged themselves to a program of  righteousness.    _XIV. Apostate Conspirators at Nauvoo._    One other factor only remains to be mentioned of those that enter into  that combination of forces that resulted in the death of the Prophet  and the Patriarch. That is the conspiracy of apostates within Nauvoo  itself.    The apostates and their sympathizers were headed by a coterie of  prominent young men: The two Law brothers, William and Wilson; Robert  D. and Charles A. Foster, brothers; Francis M. and Chauncey L. Higbee,  brothers, and unworthy sons of that most faithful man and the Prophet's  devoted friend, Judge Elias Higbee (See Vol. IV pp. 81-100 _passim_);  Sylvester Emmons and Joseph H. Jackson. Of these, William Law was  counselor in the First Presidency, and Wilson Law was a major general,  and commander of one of the cohorts of the Nauvoo Legion, and all were  or had been more or less prominent in the public life of Nauvoo.    The cause of their apostasy seems to have been the baneful influence  of John C. Bennett's immoralities; for these men were quite generally  associates of his before his flight from Nauvoo. They evidently lost  {XXXVII} the spirit of the gospel, wandered through sin into spiritual  darkness, and seemingly were obsessed by a murderous spirit against the  Prophet who boldly revealed their wickedness and publicly denounced  their conduct; and in retaliation this coterie of apostates entered  into conspiracies to encompass President Smith's death, and that of his  brother Hyrum. They were in communication with the Prophet's enemies in  Missouri, and sought to betray him into their hands. They were among  the chief actors in all schemes of opposition and conspiracies against  him in the closing year of his life, including those plots which  eventuated in the martyrdom of both Prophet and Patriarch at Carthage.    _XV. The \"Expositor\" Affair._    Such are the chief factors that enter into the combination of events  detailed in this volume of HISTORY and which have a direct relationship  to the martyrdom of the Smith brothers. They existed as combustible  materials awaiting only the spark that would set them aflame to work  death and destruction.    The spark came. It came in the destruction of the _Nauvoo Expositor,_  published by the above mentioned coterie of apostates. It was the  intention of the _Expositor,_ as its name would indicate, to make  an _expose_ of alleged conditions in Nauvoo, in the moral, social,  religious and political phase of them. Also to agitate for the  _\"unconditional repeal of the Nauvoo Charter.\"_ This was a challenge  to mortal combat, the issue being the life of the city of Nauvoo; and  after that the question of the existence of the Church in Illinois,  or even within the confines of the United States; for undoubtedly the  city charter once repealed, carrying with it the disorganization of the  Legion, protection for the Saints, as matters stood in 1844, both civil  and military, would be gone. It was a life and death struggle then  that the advent of the _Expositor_ inaugurated. The Saints stood at  such disadvantage in the proposed contest that if the _Expositor_ was  allowed to run its course it would inevitably have won its case against  the city; and against the Church, so far as the latter continuing in  Illinois, and perhaps as far as its continuance in the United States  was concerned.    The new marriage system, involving the practice, within certain  limitations and under very special conditions, of a plurality of wives,  constituted a ground of appeal to popular prejudices and passions that  would have been absolutely resistless if the paper had been allowed  to proceed. The charter would have been repealed; the city government  destroyed, or at the least modified and placed in the hands of an  apostate or anti-Mormon minority whose administration would have been  intolerable to the large majority of Nauvoo's citizens; and finally the  {XXXVIII} scenes of Missouri would have been re-enacted in an Illinois  setting.    In the presence of such difficulties, what was to be done? In addition  to declaring the existence of the practice of plural marriage, not yet  announced or publicly taught as a doctrine of the Church, and agitating  for the unqualified repeal of the Nauvoo charter, gross immoralities  were charged against leading citizens which doubtless rendered the  paper grossly libelous. In other cities such an avowed enemy as the  _Expositor_ was, would have been destroyed by a mob. For the people  of Nauvoo to have so proceeded would have been a departure from their  principles of upholding law and order, and would have brought upon  them the people of the surrounding counties, and from Missouri in  overwhelming numbers. Mob violence could not be thought of; and yet the  safety of the community imperatively demanded the suppression of the  _Expositor_ at any cost.    Under these circumstances the city council met and took under  consideration the _Expositor_ and the necessity of destroying it. As  their charter conferred upon the city the right to remove nuisances,  the city council declared the _Expositor_ press a nuisance and directed  the Mayor to have it destroyed, which he did by giving an order to that  effect, and it was destroyed without riot or tumult.    The legality of the action of the Mayor and City Council was, of  course, questionable, though some sought to defend it on legal grounds;  but it must be conceded that neither proof nor argument for legality  are convincing. On the grounds of expediency or necessity the action  is more defensible. The existence of the city, the preservation of  the Latter-day Saints until provision could be made for a retreat  from Illinois--which retreat was even then being provided for by the  Prophet in the projected movement of the Church to the west--demanded  the cessation of the publication of the _Expositor_. By proceeding at  least under the forms of law, the city council, though they might be  conscious of the illegality of their action, avoided the necessity of  the people resorting to mob action for self-preservation, and made  it possible for the legality of their course to be determined in the  courts, and the parties injured to recover compensation for the press  and damages by civil process. Meantime the libelous press with its  mission of destruction of the Saints at Nauvoo was silenced; and had  events taken the course which the action of the city council provided,  a respite would have been gained from impending violence, during which  arrangements for the retreat of the Saints from Illinois could have  been completed and a goal of safety won for them. Under a plea, then,  of absolute necessity to self-preservation of a community, and to  achieve the retreat here alluded to, and with the certainty that those  injured in property by the _Expositor's_ destruction would be fully  compensated {XXXIX} in civil action before the courts--the action of  the mayor and city council of Nauvoo is defensible, even if not on the  ground of the legality of their procedure. [26]    _XVI. The Appeal to the Mob Spirit._    Events did not take the course planned for them. The uproar that  followed the destruction of the _Expositor_ press, put all reason at  defiance. At Warsaw a mass meeting was held which issued a statement,  in connection with the resolutions it passed, that \"A mob at Nauvoo,  under a city ordinance, has violated the highest privilege in  government; and to seek redress in the ordinary way would be utterly  ineffectual. * * * _Resolved,_ that we hold ourselves at all times  in readiness to co-operate with our fellow citizens in this state,  Missouri, and Iowa, to exterminate, _utterly exterminate_ the wicked  and abominable Mormon leaders, the authors of our troubles. * * * The  time, in our opinion, has arrived when the adherents of Smith as a body  should be driven from the surrounding settlements into Nauvoo. That the  Prophet and his miscreant adherents should then be demanded at their  hands; and, if not surrendered, a war of extermination should be waged  to the entire destruction, if necessary for our protection, of his  adherents. And we hereby recommend this resolution to the consideration  of the several townships, to the mass convention to be held at  Carthage.\"    The Carthage meeting held a few days later embodied the above in their  resolutions, as did other mass meetings held at various places. The  _Warsaw Signal_ in its impression of June 12th, passionately said: [27]        \"We have only to state that this [i. e. The destruction of the      _Expositor_ press] is sufficient! War and extermination is      inevitable! CITIZENS ARISE, ONE and ALL!!! Can you stand by, and      suffer such INFERNAL DEVILS! to ROB men of their property rights,      without avenging them? We have no time to comment: every man will      make his own. LET IT BE MADE WITH POWDER and BALL!!!\"    All the combustible material to which attention is called in this  Introduction was instantly aflame at the destruction of the _Expositor_  press. Every passion was appealed to, jealousy, envy, cupidity, hatred.  All the lawless elements of the community were practically invited to  {XL} assemble and run riot in lawless violence, and excess of carnage  and destruction of property and life. Nothing but the wholesome fear of  the strength and effectiveness of the Nauvoo Legion at that time held  this lawless element in check.    It was all in vain that hearings were had before the municipal court of  Nauvoo, on the _Expositor_ matter; in vain that a subsequent hearing  was had before Esquire Wells, then not a Mormon and living outside of  Nauvoo limits; in vain that the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ sought to conciliate  the awakening wrath that was aroused in the community, by pleading  that if the city council had \"exceeded the law of the land, a higher  court could regulate the"]]]
