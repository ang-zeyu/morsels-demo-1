Ever'body had a good living.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Malindy Maxwell, Madison, Arkansas  Age: Up in 80's      \"I was born close to Como and Sardis, Mississippi. My master and  mistress was Sam Shans and Miss Cornelia Shans. I was born a slave. They  owned mama and Master Rube Sanders owned pa. Neither owner wouldn't sell  but they agreed to let ma and pa marry. They had a white preacher and  they married out in the yard and had a big table full of weddin' supper,  and the white folks et in the house. They had a big supper too. Ma said  they had a big crowd. The preacher read the ceremony. Miss Cornelia give  her a white dress and white shoes and Miss Cloe Wilburn give her a veil.  Miss Cloe was some connection of Rube Sanders.    \"They had seven children. I'm the oldest--three of us living.    \"After 'mancipation pa went to see about marrying ma over agen and they  told him that marriage would stand long as ever he lived.    \"Mama was sold at twelve years old in Atlanta, Georgia. Ma and pa was  always field hands. Grandma got to be one of John Sanders' leading hands  to work mong the women folks. They said John Sanders was meanest man  ever lived or died. According to pa's saying, Mars Ruben was a good  sorter man. Pa said John Sanders was too mean a man to have a wife. He  was mean to Miss Sarah. They said he beat her, his wife, like he beat a  nigger woman.    \"Miss Sarah say, 'Come get your rations early Saturday morning, clean up  your house, wash and iron, and we'll go to preaching tomorrow--Sunday. I  want you to all come out clean Monday morning.' They go ask Mars John  Sanders if they could go to preaching. I recken from what they said they  walked. Mars John, when they git their best clothes on, make them turn  round and go to the field and work all day long. He was just that mean.  Work all day long Sunday.    \"Miss Sarah was a Primitive Baptist and that is what I am till this day.  Some folks call us Hardshell Baptist. The colored folks set in the back  of the church. The women all set on one side and the men on the other.  If they had a middle row, there was a railing dividing mens' seats from  the womens' seats on the very same benches.    \"Miss Cloe, Miss Cornelia, and Miss Sarah cook up a whole lot of good  things to eat and go to camp meeting. Sometimes they would stay a week  and longer. They would take time bout letting the colored folks go long.  We had big times. My grandpa took a gingercake cutter with him and sold  gingercakes when they come out of the church. He could keep that money  his own. I don't know how he sold them. My sister has the cutter now I  expect. My girl has seen it. It was a foot long, this wide (5 inches),  and fluted all around the edges, and had a handle like a biscuit cutter.  They was about an inch thick. He made good ones and he sold all he could  ever make. Grandpa took carpet sacks to carry his gingercakes in to sell  them. I remember that mighty well. (The shape of the cutter was like  this: [Illustration].) He purt nigh always got to go to all the camp  meetings. Folks got happy and shouted in them days. It would be when  somebody got religion. At some big meetings they didn't shout.    \"When I was born they had a white mid-wife, Miss Martin. My mistress was  in the cabin when I was born. I was born foot foremost and had a veil on  my face and down on my body a piece. They call it a 'caul.' Sometimes I  see forms and they vanish. I can see some out of one eye now. But I've  always seen things when my sight was good. It is like when you are  dreaming at night but I see them at times that plain in day.    \"I don't know how old I am but I was a good size girl when 'mancipation  come on. Miss Cornelia had my age in her Bible. They done took me from  the cabin and I was staying at the house. I slept on a trundle bed under  Miss Cornelia's bed. Her bed was a teaster--way high up, had a big stool  to step on to go up in there and she had it curtained off. I had a good  cotton bed and I slept good up under there. Her bed was corded with sea  grass rope. It didn't have no slats like beds do now.    \"Colored folks slept on cotton beds and white folks--some of em at  least--picked geese and made feather beds and down pillows. They carded  and washed sheep's wool and put in their quilts. Some of them, they'd be  light and warm. Colored folks' bed had one leg. Then it was holes hewed  in the wall on the other three sides and wooden slats across it. Now  that wasn't no bad bed. Some of them was big enough for three to sleep  on good. When the children was small four could sleep easy cross ways,  and they slept that way.    \"They had shelves and tables and chairs. They made chests and put things  in there and set on top of it too. White folks had fine chests to keep  their bed clothes in. Some of them was made of oak, and pine, and  cypress. They would cook walnut hulls and bark and paint them dark with  the tea.    \"I recollect a right smart of the Civil War. We was close nough to hear  the roar and ramble and the big cannons shake the things in the house. I  don't know where they was fighting--a long ways off I guess.    \"I saw the soldiers scouting. They come most any time. They go in and  take every drop of milk out of the churn. They took anything they could  find and went away with it. I seen the cavalry come through. I thought  they looked so pretty. Their canteens was shining in the sun. Miss  Cornelia told me to hide, the soldiers might take me on with them. I  didn't want to go. I was very well pleased there at Miss Cornelia's.    \"I seen the cavalry come through that raised the 'white sheet.' I know  now it must have been a white flag but they called it a white sheet to  quit fighting. It was raised a short time after they passed and they  said they was the ones raised it. I don't know where it was. I reckon it  was a big white flag they rared up. It was so they would stop fighting.    \"Mars Sam Shan didn't go to no war; he hid out. He said it was a useless  war, he wasn't going to get shot up for no use a tall, and he never went  a step. He hid out. I don't know where. I know Charles would take the  baskets off. Charles tended to the stock and the carriage. He drove the  wagon and carriage. He fetched water and wood. He was a black boy. Mars  Sam Shan said he wasn't goiner loose his life for nothing.    \"Miss Cornelia would cook corn light bread and muffins and anything else  they had to cook. Rations got down mighty scarce before it was done wid.  They put the big round basket nearly big as a split cotton basket out on  the back portico. Charles come and disappear with it.    \"Chess and Charles was colored overseers. He didn't have white  overseers. Miss Cornelia and Miss Cloe would walk the floor and cry and  I would walk between. I would cry feeling sorry for them, but I didn't  know why they cried so much. I know now it was squally times. War is  horrible.    \"Mars Sam Shan come home, went down to the cabins--they was scattered  over the fields--and told them the War was over, they was free but that  they could stay. Then come some runners, white men. They was Yankee men.  I know that now. They say you must get pay or go off. We stayed that  year. Another man went to pa and said he would give him half of what he  made. He got us all up and we went to Pleasant Hill. We done tolerable  well.    \"Then he tried to buy a house and five acres and got beat out of it. The  minor heirs come and took it. I never learnt in books till I went to  school. Seem like things was in a confusion after I got big nough for  that. I'd sweep and rake and cook and wash the dishes, card, spin, hoe,  scour the floors and tables. I would knit at night heap of times. We'd  sing some at night.    \"Colored folks couldn't read so they couldn't sing at church lessen they  learnt the songs by hearing them at home. Colored folks would meet and  sing and pray and preach at the cabins.    \"My first teacher was a white man, Mr. Babe Willroy. I went to him  several short sessions and on rainy days and cold days I couldn't work  in the field. I worked in the field all my life. Cook out in the winter,  back to the field in the spring till fall again.    \"Well, I jes' had this one girl. I carried her along with me. She would  play round and then she was a heap of help. She is mighty good to me  now.    \"I never seen a Ku Klux in my life. Now, I couldn't tell you about them.    \"My parents' names was Lou Sanders and Anthony Sanders. Ma's mother was  a Rockmore and her husband was a Cherokee Indian. I recollect them well.  He was a free man and was fixing to buy her freedom. Her young mistress  married Mr. Joe Bues and she heired her. Mr. Joe Bues drunk her up and  they come and got her and took her off. They run her to Memphis before  his wife could write to her pa. He was Mars Rockmore.    \"Grandma was put on a block and sold fore grandpa could cumerlate nough  cash to buy her for his wife. Grandma never seen her ma no more. Grandpa  followed her and Mr. Sam Shans bought her and took her to Mississippi  with a lot more he bought.    \"My pa's ma b'long to John Sanders and grandpa b'long to Rube Sanders.  They was brothers. Rube Sanders bought grandpa from Enoch Bobo down in  Mississippi. The Bobo's had a heap of slaves and land. Now, he was the  one that sold gingercakes. He was a blacksmith too. Both my grandpas was  blacksmiths but my Indian grandpa could make wagons, trays, bowls,  shoes, and things out of wood too. Him being a free man made his living  that way. But he never could cumolate enough to buy grandma.    \"My other grandma was blacker than I am and grandpa too. When grandpa  died he was carried back to the Bobo graveyard and buried on Enoch  Bobo's place. It was his request all his slaves be brought back and  buried on his land. I went to the burying. I recollect that but ma and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547"],[0,"Blackfoot Lodge Tales: The Story of a Prairie People (#9)"],[1," They all went on horseback, for the berries were a  long way from camp. When they got to the place, the man told the women to  keep near their horses all the time. He would go up on a butte near by and  watch. \"Be careful,\" he said. \"Keep by your horses, and if you see me  signal, throw away your berries, get on your horses and ride towards camp  as fast as you can.\"    They had not picked many berries before the man saw a war party coming. He  signalled the women, and got on his horse and rode towards them. It  happened that this man and his wife both had good horses, but the others,  all old women, rode slow old travois horses, and the enemy soon overtook  and killed them. Many kept on after the two on good horses, and after a  while the woman's horse began to get tired; so she asked her husband to let  her ride on his horse with him. The woman got up behind him, and they went  on again. The horse was a very powerful one, and for a while went very  fast; but two persons make a heavy load, and soon the enemy began to gain  on them. The man was now in a bad plight; the enemy were overtaking him,  and the woman holding him bound his arms so that he could not use his bow.    \"Get off,\" he said to her. \"The enemy will not kill you. You are too young  and pretty. Some one of them will take you, and I will get a big party of  our people and rescue you.\"    \"No, no,\" cried the woman; \"let us die here together.\"    \"Why die?\" cried the man. \"We are yet young, and may live a long time  together. If you don't get off, they will soon catch us and kill me, and  then they will take you anyhow. Get off, and in only a short time I will  get you back.\"    \"No, no,\" again cried the woman; \"I will die here with you.\"    \"Crazy person!\" cried the man, and with a quick jerk he threw the woman  off.    As he said, the enemy did not kill her. The first one who came up counted  _coup_ and took her. The man, now that his horse was lightened, easily ran  away from the war party, and got safe to camp.      II    Then there was great mourning. The relatives of the old women who had been  killed, cut their hair and cried. The man, too, cut off his hair and  mourned. He knew that his wife was not killed, but he felt very badly  because he was separated from her. He painted himself black, and walked all  through the camp, crying. His wife had many relations, and some of them  went to the man and said: \"We pity you very much. We mourn, too, for our  sister. But come. Take courage. We will go with you, and try to get her  back.\"    \"It is good,\" replied the man. \"I feel as if I should die, stopping  uselessly here. Let us start soon.\"    That evening they got ready, and at daylight started out on foot. There  were seven of them in all. The husband, five middle-aged men, the woman's  relations, and a young man, her own young brother. He was a very pretty  boy. His hair was longer than any other person's in camp.    They soon found the trail of the war party, and followed it for some  days. At last they came to the Big River,[1] and there, on the other side,  they saw many lodges. They crept down a coulee into the valley, and hid in  a small piece of timber just opposite the camp. Toward evening the man  said: \"_Kyi_, my brothers. To-night I will swim across and look all through  the camp for my wife. If I do not find her, I will cache and look again  to-morrow evening. But if I do not return before daylight of the second  night, then you will know I am killed. Then you will do as you think best.  Maybe you will want to take revenge. Maybe you will go right back  home. That will be as your hearts feel.\"    [Footnote 1: Missouri River.]    As soon as it was dark, he swam across the river and went all about through  the camp, peeping in through the doorways of the lodges, but he did not see  his wife. Still, he knew she must be there. He had followed the trail of  the party to this place. They had not killed her on the way. He kept  looking in at the lodges until it was late, and the people let the fires go  out and went to bed. Then the man went down to where the women got their  water from the river. Everywhere along the stream was a cut bank, but in  one place a path of steps had been made down to the water's edge. Near this  path, he dug a hole in the bank and crawled into it, closing up the  entrance, except one small hole, through which he could look, and watch the  people who came to the river.    As soon as it was daylight, the women began to come for water. _Tum, tum,  tum, tum_, he could hear their footsteps as they came down the path, and he  looked eagerly at every one. All day long the people came and went,--the  young and old; and the children played about near him. He saw many strange  people that day. It was now almost sunset, and he began to think that he  would not see his wife there. _Tum, tum, tum, tum_, another woman came  down the steps, and stopped at the water's edge. Her dress was strange, but  he thought he knew the form. She turned her head and looked down the river,  and he saw her face. It was his wife. He pushed away the dirt, crawled  out, went to her and kissed her. \"_Kyi_,\" he said, \"hurry, and let us swim  across the river. Five of your relations and your own young brother are  waiting for us in that piece of timber.\"    \"Wait,\" replied his wife. \"These people have given me a great many pretty  things. Let me go back. When it is night I will gather them up, steal a  horse, and cross over to you.\"    \"No, no,\" cried the man. \"Let the pretty things go; come, let us cross at  once.\"    \"Pity me,\" said the woman. \"Let me go and get my things. I will surely come  to-night. I speak the truth.\"    \"How do you speak the truth?\"[1] asked her husband.    [Footnote 1: Blackfoot--_Tsa-ki-an-ist-o-man-i?_ i.e., How you like truth?]    \"That my relations there across the river may be safe and live long, I  speak the truth.\"    \"Go then,\" said the man, \"and get your things. I will cross the river now.\"  He went up on the bank and walked down the river, keeping his face  hidden. No one noticed him, or if they did, they thought he belonged to the  camp. As soon as he had passed the first bend, he swam across the river,  and soon joined his relations.    \"I have seen my wife,\" he said to them. \"She will come over as soon as it  is dark. I let her go back to get some things that were given her.\"    \"You are crazy,\" said one of the men, \"very crazy. She already loves this  new man she has, or she would not have wanted to go back.\"    \"Stop that,\" said the husband; \"do not talk bad of her. She will surely  come.\"      III    The woman went back to her lodge with the water, and, sitting down near the  fireplace, she began to act very strangely. She took up pieces of charred  wood, dirt, and ashes in her hands and ate them, and made queer noises.    \"What is it?\" asked the man who had taken her for a wife. \"What is the  matter with you?\" He spoke in signs.    The woman also spoke in signs. She answered him: \"The Sun told me that  there are seven persons across the river in that piece of timber. Five of  them are middle-aged, another is a young boy with very long hair, another  is a man who mourns. His hair is cut short.\"    The Snake did not know what to do, so he called in some chiefs and old men  to advise with him. They thought that the woman might be very strong  medicine. At all events, it would be a good thing to go and look. So the  news was shouted out, and in a short time all the warriors had mounted  their best horses, and started across the river. It was then almost dark,  so they surrounded the piece of timber, and waited for morning to begin the  search.    \"_Kyi_,\" said one of the woman's relations to her husband. \"Did I not  speak the truth? You see now what that woman has done for us.\"    At daylight the poor husband strung his bow, took a handful of arrows from  his quiver, and said: \"This is my fault. I have brought you to this. It is  right that I should die first,\" and he started to go out of the timber.    \"Wait,\" said the eldest relative. \"It shall not be so. I am the first to  go. I cannot stay back to see my brother die. You shall go out last.\" So he  jumped out of the brush, and began shooting his arrows, but was soon  killed.    \"My brother is too far on the road alone,\"[1] cried another relation, and  he jumped out and fought, too. What use, one against so many? The Snakes  soon had his scalp.    [Footnote 1: Meaning that his brother's spirit, or shadow, was travelling  alone the road to the Sand Hills, and that he must overtake him.]    So they went out, one after another, and at last the husband was alone. He  rushed out very brave, and shot his arrows as fast as he could. \"Hold!\"  cried the Snake man to his people. \"Do not kill him; catch him. This is the  one my wife said to bring back alive. See! his hair is cut short.\" So, when  the man had shot away all his arrows, they seized and tied him, and, taking  the scalps of the others, returned to camp.    They took the prisoner into the lodge where his wife was. His hands were  tied behind his back, and they tied his feet, too. He could not move.    As soon as the man saw his wife, he cried. He was not afraid. He did not  care now how soon he died. He cried because he was thinking of all the  trouble and death this woman had caused. \"What have I done to you,\" he  asked his wife, \"that you should treat me this way? Did I not always use  you well? I never struck you. I never made you work hard.\"    \"What does he say?\" asked the Snake man.    \"He says,\" replied the woman, \"that when you are done smoking, you must  knock the ashes and fire out of your pipe on his breast.\"    The Snake was not a bad-hearted man, but he thought now that this woman had  strong medicine, that she had Sun power; so he thought that everything must  be done as she said. When the man had finished smoking, he emptied the pipe  on the Piegan's breast, and the fire burned him badly.   "]]]
