Eldred would of course show him the book, from which the leaf would  already have been removed. He might, perhaps, find traces of the  removal--a torn edge of a fly-leaf probably--and who could disprove, what  Eldred was certain to say, that he too had noticed and regretted the  mutilation? Altogether the chase seemed very hopeless. The one chance was  this. The book had left the library at 10.30: it might not have been put  into the first possible train, at 11.20. Granted that, then he might be  lucky enough to arrive simultaneously with it and patch up some story  which would induce Eldred to give it up.    It was drawing towards evening when he got out upon the platform of his  station, and, like most country stations, this one seemed unnaturally  quiet. He waited about till the one or two passengers who got out with  him had drifted off, and then inquired of the station-master whether Mr  Eldred was in the neighbourhood.    'Yes, and pretty near too, I believe. I fancy he means calling here for a  parcel he expects. Called for it once to-day already, didn't he, Bob?'  (to the porter).    'Yes, sir, he did; and appeared to think it was all along of me that it  didn't come by the two o'clock. Anyhow, I've got it for him now,' and the  porter flourished a square parcel, which a glance assured Garrett  contained all that was of any importance to him at that particular  moment.    'Bretfield, sir? Yes--three miles just about. Short cut across these  three fields brings it down by half a mile. There: there's Mr Eldred's  trap.'    A dog-cart drove up with two men in it, of whom Garrett, gazing back as  he crossed the little station yard, easily recognized one. The fact that  Eldred was driving was slightly in his favour--for most likely he would  not open the parcel in the presence of his servant. On the other hand, he  would get home quickly, and unless Garrett were there within a very few  minutes of his arrival, all would be over. He must hurry; and that he  did. His short cut took him along one side of a triangle, while the cart  had two sides to traverse; and it was delayed a little at the station, so  that Garrett was in the third of the three fields when he heard the  wheels fairly near. He had made the best progress possible, but the pace  at which the cart was coming made him despair. At this rate it _must_  reach home ten minutes before him, and ten minutes would more than  suffice for the fulfilment of Mr Eldred's project.    It was just at this time that the luck fairly turned. The evening was  still, and sounds came clearly. Seldom has any sound given greater relief  than that which he now heard: that of the cart pulling up. A few words  were exchanged, and it drove on. Garrett, halting in the utmost anxiety,  was able to see as it drove past the stile (near which he now stood) that  it contained only the servant and not Eldred; further, he made out that  Eldred was following on foot. From behind the tall hedge by the stile  leading into the road he watched the thin wiry figure pass quickly by  with the parcel beneath its arm, and feeling in its pockets. Just as he  passed the stile something fell out of a pocket upon the grass, but with  so little sound that Eldred was not conscious of it. In a moment more it  was safe for Garrett to cross the stile into the road and pick up--a box  of matches. Eldred went on, and, as he went, his arms made hasty  movements, difficult to interpret in the shadow of the trees that  overhung the road. But, as Garrett followed cautiously, he found at  various points the key to them--a piece of string, and then the wrapper  of the parcel--meant to be thrown over the hedge, but sticking in it.    Now Eldred was walking slower, and it could just be made out that he had  opened the book and was turning over the leaves. He stopped, evidently  troubled by the failing light. Garrett slipped into a gate-opening, but  still watched. Eldred, hastily looking around, sat down on a felled  tree-trunk by the roadside and held the open book up close to his eyes.  Suddenly he laid it, still open, on his knee, and felt in all his  pockets: clearly in vain, and clearly to his annoyance. 'You would be  glad of your matches now,' thought Garrett. Then he took hold of a leaf,  and was carefully tearing it out, when two things happened. First,  something black seemed to drop upon the white leaf and run down it, and  then as Eldred started and was turning to look behind him, a little dark  form appeared to rise out of the shadow behind the tree-trunk and from it  two arms enclosing a mass of blackness came before Eldred's face and  covered his head and neck. His legs and arms were wildly flourished, but  no sound came. Then, there was no more movement. Eldred was alone. He had  fallen back into the grass behind the tree-trunk. The book was cast into  the roadway. Garrett, his anger and suspicion gone for the moment at the  sight of this horrid struggle, rushed up with loud cries of 'Help!' and  so too, to his enormous relief, did a labourer who had just emerged from  a field opposite. Together they bent over and supported Eldred, but to no  purpose. The conclusion that he was dead was inevitable. 'Poor  gentleman!' said Garrett to the labourer, when they had laid him down,  'what happened to him, do you think?' 'I wasn't two hundred yards away,'  said the man, 'when I see Squire Eldred setting reading in his book, and  to my thinking he was took with one of these fits--face seemed to go all  over black.' 'Just so,' said Garrett. 'You didn't see anyone near him? It  couldn't have been an assault?' 'Not possible--no one couldn't have got  away without you or me seeing them.' 'So I thought. Well, we must get  some help, and the doctor and the policeman; and perhaps I had better  give them this book.'    It was obviously a case for an inquest, and obvious also that Garrett  must stay at Bretfield and give his evidence. The medical inspection  showed that, though some black dust was found on the face and in the  mouth of the deceased, the cause of death was a shock to a weak heart,  and not asphyxiation. The fateful book was produced, a respectable quarto  printed wholly in Hebrew, and not of an aspect likely to excite even the  most sensitive.    'You say, Mr Garrett, that the deceased gentleman appeared at the moment  before his attack to be tearing a leaf out of this book?'    'Yes; I think one of the fly-leaves.'    'There is here a fly-leaf partially torn through. It has Hebrew writing  on it. Will you kindly inspect it?'    'There are three names in English, sir, also, and a date. But I am sorry  to say I cannot read Hebrew writing.'    'Thank you. The names have the appearance of being signatures. They are  John Rant, Walter Gibson, and James Frost, and the date is 20 July, 1875.  Does anyone here know any of these names?'    The Rector, who was present, volunteered a statement that the uncle of  the deceased, from whom he inherited, had been named Rant.    The book being handed to him, he shook a puzzled head. 'This is not like  any Hebrew I ever learnt.'    'You are sure that it is Hebrew?'    'What? Yes--I suppose.... No--my dear sir, you are perfectly right--that  is, your suggestion is exactly to the point. Of course--it is not Hebrew  at all. It is English, and it is a will.'    It did not take many minutes to show that here was indeed a will of Dr  John Rant, bequeathing the whole of the property lately held by John  Eldred to Mrs Mary Simpson. Clearly the discovery of such a document  would amply justify Mr Eldred's agitation. As to the partial tearing of  the leaf, the coroner pointed out that no useful purpose could be  attained by speculations whose correctness it would never be possible to  establish.           *       *       *       *       *    The Tractate Middoth was naturally taken in charge by the coroner for  further investigation, and Mr Garrett explained privately to him the  history of it, and the position of events so far as he knew or guessed  them.    He returned to his work next day, and on his walk to the station passed  the scene of Mr Eldred's catastrophe. He could hardly leave it without  another look, though the recollection of what he had seen there made him  shiver, even on that bright morning. He walked round, with some  misgivings, behind the felled tree. Something dark that still lay there  made him start back for a moment: but it hardly stirred. Looking closer,  he saw that it was a thick black mass of cobwebs; and, as he stirred it  gingerly with his stick, several large spiders ran out of it into the  grass.           *       *       *       *       *    There is no great difficulty in imagining the steps by which William  Garrett, from being an assistant in a great library, attained to his  present position of prospective owner of Bretfield Manor, now in the  occupation of his mother-in-law, Mrs Mary Simpson.          CASTING THE RUNES    _April 15th, 190-_    Dear Sir,    I am requested by the Council of the ---- Association to return to you  the draft of a paper on _The Truth of Alchemy_, which you have been good  enough to offer to read at our forthcoming meeting, and to inform you  that the Council do not see their way to including it in the programme.    I am,    Yours faithfully,    --- _Secretary._           *       *       *       *       *    _April 18th_    Dear Sir,    I am sorry to say that my engagements do not permit of my affording you  an interview on the subject of your proposed paper. Nor do our laws allow  of your discussing the matter with a Committee of our Council, as you  suggest. Please allow me to assure you that the fullest consideration was  given to the draft which you submitted, and that it was not declined  without having been referred to the judgement of a most competent  authority. No personal question (it can hardly be necessary for me to  add)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#8)"],[1," prize is thine, and right fairly won. Now, thou ragged  knave, let me see thee shoot a better shaft than that.\"    Nought spake the stranger but took his place, while all was hushed, and  no one spoke or even seemed to breathe, so great was the silence  for wonder what he would do. Meanwhile, also, quite still stood the  stranger, holding his bow in his hand, while one could count five; then  he drew his trusty yew, holding it drawn but a moment, then loosed the  string. Straight flew the arrow, and so true that it smote a gray goose  feather from off Gilbert's shaft, which fell fluttering through the  sunlit air as the stranger's arrow lodged close beside his of the Red  Cap, and in the very center. No one spoke a word for a while and no one  shouted, but each man looked into his neighbor's face amazedly.    \"Nay,\" quoth old Adam o' the Dell presently, drawing a long breath  and shaking his head as he spoke, \"twoscore years and more have I shot  shaft, and maybe not all times bad, but I shoot no more this day, for  no man can match with yon stranger, whosoe'er he may be.\" Then he  thrust his shaft into his quiver, rattling, and unstrung his bow without  another word.    Then the Sheriff came down from his dais and drew near, in all his silks  and velvets, to where the tattered stranger stood leaning upon his  stout bow, while the good folk crowded around to see the man who shot so  wondrously well. \"Here, good fellow,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"take thou  the prize, and well and fairly hast thou won it, I bow. What may be thy  name, and whence comest thou?\"    \"Men do call me Jock o' Teviotdale, and thence am I come,\" said the  stranger.    \"Then, by Our Lady, Jock, thou art the fairest archer that e'er mine  eyes beheld, and if thou wilt join my service I will clothe thee with a  better coat than that thou hast upon thy back; thou shalt eat and drink  of the best, and at every Christmastide fourscore marks shall be thy  wage. I trow thou drawest better bow than that same coward knave Robin  Hood, that dared not show his face here this day. Say, good fellow, wilt  thou join my service?\"    \"Nay, that will I not,\" quoth the stranger roughly. \"I will be mine own,  and no man in all merry England shall be my master.\"    \"Then get thee gone, and a murrain seize thee!\" cried the Sheriff, and  his voice trembled with anger. \"And by my faith and troth, I have a good  part of a mind to have thee beaten for thine insolence!\" Then he turned  upon his heel and strode away.    It was a right motley company that gathered about the noble greenwood  tree in Sherwood's depths that same day. A score and more of barefoot  friars were there, and some that looked like tinkers, and some that  seemed to be sturdy beggars and rustic hinds; and seated upon a mossy  couch was one all clad in tattered scarlet, with a patch over one eye;  and in his hand he held the golden arrow that was the prize of the great  shooting match. Then, amidst a noise of talking and laughter, he took  the patch from off his eye and stripped away the scarlet rags from off  his body and showed himself all clothed in fair Lincoln green; and  quoth he, \"Easy come these things away, but walnut stain cometh not so  speedily from yellow hair.\" Then all laughed louder than before, for it  was Robin Hood himself that had won the prize from the Sheriff's very  hands.    Then all sat down to the woodland feast and talked among themselves  of the merry jest that had been played upon the Sheriff, and of the  adventures that had befallen each member of the band in his disguise.  But when the feast was done, Robin Hood took Little John apart and said,  \"Truly am I vexed in my blood, for I heard the Sheriff say today, 'Thou  shootest better than that coward knave Robin Hood, that dared not show  his face here this day.' I would fain let him know who it was who won  the golden arrow from out his hand, and also that I am no coward such as  he takes me to be.\"    Then Little John said, \"Good master, take thou me and Will Stutely, and  we will send yon fat Sheriff news of all this by a messenger such as he  doth not expect.\"    That day the Sheriff sat at meat in the great hall of his house  at Nottingham Town. Long tables stood down the hall, at which sat  men-at-arms and household servants and good stout villains,(1) in all  fourscore and more. There they talked of the day's shooting as they ate  their meat and quaffed their ale. The Sheriff sat at the head of the  table upon a raised seat under a canopy, and beside him sat his dame.         (1) Bond-servants.    \"By my troth,\" said he, \"I did reckon full roundly that that knave Robin  Hood would be at the game today. I did not think that he was such a  coward. But who could that saucy knave be who answered me to my beard  so bravely? I wonder that I did not have him beaten; but there was  something about him that spoke of other things than rags and tatters.\"    Then, even as he finished speaking, something fell rattling among the  dishes on the table, while those that sat near started up wondering  what it might be. After a while one of the men-at-arms gathered courage  enough to pick it up and bring it to the Sheriff. Then everyone saw  that it was a blunted gray goose shaft, with a fine scroll, about the  thickness of a goose quill, tied near to its head. The Sheriff opened  the scroll and glanced at it, while the veins upon his forehead swelled  and his cheeks grew ruddy with rage as he read, for this was what he  saw:         \"_Now Heaven bless Thy Grace this day       Say all in sweet Sherwood       For thou didst give the prize away       To merry Robin Hood_.\"    \"Whence came this?\" cried the Sheriff in a mighty voice.    \"Even through the window, Your Worship,\" quoth the man who had handed  the shaft to him.          Will Stutely Rescued by His Companions    NOW WHEN THE SHERIFF found that neither law nor guile could overcome  Robin Hood, he was much perplexed, and said to himself, \"Fool that I am!  Had I not told our King of Robin Hood, I would not have gotten myself  into such a coil; but now I must either take him captive or have wrath  visited upon my head from his most gracious Majesty. I have tried law,  and I have tried guile, and I have failed in both; so I will try what  may be done with might.\"    Thus communing within himself, he called his constables together and  told them what was in his mind. \"Now take ye each four men, all armed  in proof,\" said he, \"and get ye gone to the forest, at different points,  and lie in wait for this same Robin Hood. But if any constable finds  too many men against him, let him sound a horn, and then let each band  within hearing come with all speed and join the party that calls them.  Thus, I think, shall we take this green-clad knave. Furthermore, to him  that first meeteth with Robin Hood shall one hundred pounds of silver  money be given, if he be brought to me dead or alive; and to him that  meeteth with any of his band shall twoscore pounds be given, if such be  brought to me dead or alive. So, be ye bold and be ye crafty.\"    So thus they went in threescore companies of five to Sherwood Forest, to  take Robin Hood, each constable wishing that he might be the one to find  the bold outlaw, or at least one of his band. For seven days and nights  they hunted through the forest glades, but never saw so much as a single  man in Lincoln green; for tidings of all this had been brought to Robin  Hood by trusty Eadom o' the Blue Boar.    When he first heard the news, Robin said, \"If the Sheriff dare send  force to meet force, woe will it be for him and many a better man  besides, for blood will flow and there will be great trouble for all.  But fain would I shun blood and battle, and fain would I not deal sorrow  to womenfolk and wives because good stout yeomen lose their lives. Once  I slew a man, and never do I wish to slay a man again, for it is bitter  for the soul to think thereon. So now we will abide silently in Sherwood  Forest, so that it may be well for all, but should we be forced to  defend ourselves, or any of our band, then let each man draw bow and  brand with might and main.\"    At this speech many of the band shook their heads, and said to  themselves, \"Now the Sheriff will think that we are cowards, and folk  will scoff throughout the countryside, saying that we fear to meet these  men.\" But they said nothing aloud, swallowing their words and doing as  Robin bade them.    Thus they hid in the depths of Sherwood Forest for seven days and seven  nights and never showed their faces abroad in all that time; but early  in the morning of the eighth day Robin Hood called the band together and  said, \"Now who will go and find what the Sheriff's men are at by this  time? For I know right well they will not bide forever within Sherwood  shades.\"    At this a great shout arose, and each man waved his bow aloft and cried  that he might be the one to go. Then Robin Hood's heart was proud when  he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, \"Brave and  true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows  are ye, but ye cannot all go, so I will choose one from among you, and  it shall be good Will Stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox  in Sherwood Forest.\"    Then Will Stutely leaped high aloft and laughed loudly, clapping his  hands for pure joy that he should have been chosen from among them all.  \"Now thanks, good master,\" quoth he, \"and if I bring not news of those  knaves to thee, call me no more thy sly Will Stutely.\"    Then he clad himself in a friar's gown, and underneath the robe he hung  a good broadsword in such a place that he could easily lay hands upon  it. Thus clad, he set forth upon his quest, until he came to the verge  of the forest, and so to the highway. He saw two bands of the Sheriff's  men, yet he turned neither to the right nor the left, but only drew his  cowl the closer over his face, folding his hands as if "]]]
