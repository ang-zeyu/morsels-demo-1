Finally Tom and his father, after posting large signs,  warning persons to keep away, added others to the effect that  undesirable visitors might find themselves unexpectedly shocked by  electricity, if they ventured too close. This had the desired effect,  though the wires which were strung about carried such a mild charge  that it would not have harmed a child. Then the only bothersome  characters were the boys of the town, and, fearless and careless lads,  they persisted in hanging around the Swift homestead, in the hope of  seeing Tom dash away at the rate of five hundred miles an hour, which  one enthusiastic writer predicted he would do.    \"I've got a plan!\" exclaimed Tom one day when the boys had been  particularly troublesome.    \"What is it?\" asked his father.    \"We'll hire Eradicate Sampson to stand guard with a bucket of  whitewash. He'll keep the boys away.\"    The plan was put into operation, and Eradicate and his mule, Boomerang,  were installed on the premises.    \"Deed an' Ah'll keep dem lads away,\" promised the colored man.  \"Ah'll  splash white stuff all ober 'em, if dey comes traipsin' around me.\"    He was as good as his word, and, when one or two lads had received a  dose of the stuff, which punishment was followed by more severe from  home, for having gotten their clothes soiled, the nuisance ceased, to a  certain extent. Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey were two who received a  liberal sprinkling of the lime, and they vowed vengeance on Tom.    \"And Andy Foger will help us, too,\" added Sam, as he withdrew, after an  encounter with Eradicate.    \"Doan't let dat worry yo', Mistah Swift!\" exclaimed the darkey.  \"Jest  let dat low-down-good-fo-nuffin' Andy Foger come 'round me, an' Ah'll  make him t'ink he's de inside ob a chicken coop, dat's what Ah will.\"    Perhaps Andy heard of this, and kept away. In the meanwhile Tom kept on  perfecting his car and battery. From the club secretary he learned that  a number of inventors were working on electric cars, and there promised  to be many of the speedy vehicles in the race.    After considerable labor Tom had succeeded in getting together one set  of the batteries. He had them completed one afternoon, and wanted to  give them a test that night. But, when he went to his father's chemical  laboratory for a certain powder, which he needed to use in the battery  solution, he found there was none.    \"I'll have to ride in to Mansburg for some,\" he decided. \"I'll go after  supper, on my motor-cycle, and test the battery to-night.\"    The young inventor left his house immediately after the evening meal.  Along the road toward Mansburg he speeded, and, as he came to the foot  of a hill, where once Andy Foger had put a big tree, hoping Tom would  run into it and be injured, the youth recalled that circumstance.    \"Andy has been keeping out of my way lately,\" mused Tom. \"I wonder if  he's up to any mischief? I don't like the way Sam Snedecker is hanging  around the shop, either. It looks as if they were plotting something.  But I guess Eradicate and his pail of whitewash will scare them off.\"    Tom got the powdered chemical he wanted in the drug store, and, after  refreshing himself with some ice cream soda, he started back. As he  rode along through the streets of the town he kept a lookout, and those  of you who know how fond the lad was of a certain young lady, do not  need to be told for whom he was looking. But he did not see her, and  soon turned into the main highway leading to Shopton.    It was dark when he reached the hill, where once he had been so near an  accident, and he slowed up as he coasted down it, using the brake at  intervals.    Tom got safely to the bottom of the declivity, and was about to turn on  the power of his machine, when, from the bushes that lined either side  of the roadway, several figures sprang suddenly. They ranged themselves  across the road, and one cried: \"Halt!\" in tones that were meant to be  stern, but which seemed to Tom, to tremble somewhat. The young inventor  was so surprised that he did not open the gasolene throttle, nor switch  on his spark. As a consequence his motor-cycle lost momentum, and he  had to take one foot from the pedal and touch the ground, to prevent  himself from toppling over.    \"Hold on there!\" cried another voice. \"We've got you where we want you,  now! Hold on! Don't go!\"    \"I wasn't going to go,\" responded Tom calmly, trying to recognize the  voice, which seemed to be unnatural. \"What do you want, and who are  you?\"    \"Never mind who we are. We want you and we've got you! Get off that  wheel!\"    \"I don't see why I should!\" exclaimed Tom, and he suddenly shifted his  handle bars, so as to flash the bright headlight he carried, upon the  circle of dark figures that opposed his progress. As the light flashed  on them he was surprised to see that all the figures wore masks over  their faces.    Tom started. Was this the Happy Harry gang after him again? He hoped  not, yet the fact that the persons had on masks made the hold-up have  an ugly look. Once more Tom flashed the light on the throng. There were  exclamations of dismay.    \"Douse that glim, somebody!\" called a sharp voice, which Tom could not  recognize.    A stone came whizzing through the air, from some one in the crowd.  There was a smashing of glass as it hit the lantern, and the road was  plunged in darkness. Tom tried to throw one leg over the saddle, and  let down the supporting stand from the rear wheel, so the motor-cycle  would remain upright without him holding it. He determined to have  revenge for that act of vandalism in breaking his lamp.    But, just as he was free of the seat, he was surrounded by a dozen  persons, and several hands were laid on him.    \"We've got you now!\" some one fairly hissed in his ear. \"Come along,  and get what's coming to you!\"    Tom tried to fight, but he was overpowered by numbers and, a little  later, was dragged off into the woods in the darkness by the masked  figures. His arms were securely bound with ropes, and a handkerchief  was tied over his eyes. Tom Swift was a prisoner.          CHAPTER VIII    A BLINDING FLASH      Stumbling on through the dark woods, led by his captors, Tom tried to  pierce the gloom and identify the persons who had firm grips on either  side of him. But it was useless. A little light sifted down from the  starlit sky above, but it was not sufficient. The young inventor was  beginning to think, after all, that he had fallen into the hands of the  Happy Harry gang, and he knew that if this was so he need expect no  mercy.    But two things were against this belief. One was that the principal  members of the gang were still in jail, or at least they were supposed  to be, and another was that there were too many of the captors. Happy  Harry's crowd never numbered so many.    \"Maybe they're highwaymen,\" thought our hero, as he was dragged along  \"But that can't be,\" he reasoned further. \"If they wanted to rob me  they'd have done it back there in the road, and not brought me off here  in the woods. Besides, I haven't anything for them to steal.\"    Suddenly Tom stumbled over a projecting root, and nearly fell, dragging  along with him the person who had hold of his left arm.    \"Look out there! What's the matter with you?\" exclaimed one of the  throng quickly, and at the sound of the voice Tom started.    \"Andy Foger!\" cried the young inventor, as he recovered himself, for he  had recognized the voice of the red-haired bully.  \"What do you mean by  holding me up in this way?\" he demanded.    \"Quiet!\" urged a voice in his ear, and the tones were unfamiliar.  \"Mention no names!\"    \"I'm on to your game!\" retorted Tom. \"I know you're here, Andy, and Sam  and Pete; and Jack Reynolds and Sid Holton,\" and he named two rather  loose-charactered lads, who were often in the company of Andy and his  cronies. \"You'd better quit this nonsense,\" Tom went on. \"I'll cause  the arrest of all of you if you make trouble for me. I know who you are  now!\"    \"You think you do,\" answered the voice in his ear, and the young  inventor concluded that it must be some lad whom he did not know. \"Nor  is this nonsense,\" the other went on. \"You are about to receive the  punishment due you.\"    Our hero did not answer, but he was doing some hard thinking.  He  wondered why Andy and his crowd had captured him.    Suddenly the blackness of the woods was illuminated by the fitful gleam  of a distant fire. Tom could see more plainly now, and he managed to  count about ten dusky figures hurrying along, four being close to him,  to prevent his escape, and the others running on ahead. The light  became stronger, and, a moment later the prisoner and his captors  emerged into a little clearing, where a fire was burning. Two figures,  masked with black cloth, as were all in the crowd, stood about the  blaze, putting on sticks of wood.    \"Did you get him?\" asked one of these figures eagerly.    \"Yes, they got me, Sam Snedecker,\" answered Tom quickly, recognizing  Sam's tones. \"And they'll wish they hadn't before I'm done with them.\"    \"Quiet!\" ordered an unknown voice. \"Members of the Deep Forest Throng,  the prisoner is here!\" the lad went on.    \"'Tis well, bind the captive to the sacrificial tree,\" was the response  from some one in the crowd.    Tom laughed. He was at ease now, for he recognized that those who had  taken him prisoner were all lads of Andy's character.  Most of them  were Shopton youths, but some, evidently, were strangers in town. Tom  felt he had little to fear.    \"Bring him over here,\" ordered one, and Tom cried out:    \"You wouldn't be giving those orders, Andy Foger, if my arms weren't  tied. And if you'll untie me, I'll fight any two of you at once,\"  offered the young inventor fiercely, for he hated the humiliation to  which he was being subjected.    \"Don't do it! Don't untie him!\" begged some one.    \"No danger, they won't."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#8)"],[1,"more gentle. Then there is the wild vicuna, the fleece of which is  made into a sort of wool, after which a certain kind of cloth is named.    \"Then there is the taruco, a kind of deer, the viscacha, which is a big  rat, the otoc, a sort of wild dog, or fox, and the ucumari, a black  bear with a white nose. This bear is often found on lofty mountain  tops, but only when driven there in search of food.    \"The condors, of course, are big birds of prey in the Andes. You must  have read about them; how they seem to lie in the upper regions of the  air, motionless, until suddenly they catch sight of some dead animal  far down below when they sweep toward it with the swiftness of the  wink. There is another bird of the vulture variety, with wings of black  and white feathers. The ancient Incas used to decorate their head  dresses with these wing feathers.\"    \"Well, I'm glad I'm going to Peru,\" said Tom. \"I never knew it was such  an interesting country. But I don't suppose we'll have time to see much  of it.\"    \"Oh, I think you will,\" commented Mr. Titus. \"We don't always have to  work on the tunnel. There are numerous holidays, or holy-days, which  our Indian workers take off, and we can do nothing without them. I'll  see that you have a chance to do some exploring if you wish.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I brought my electric rifle with me, and I may  get a chance to pop over one of those bears with a white nose. Are they  good to eat?\"    \"The Indians eat them, I believe, when they can get them, but I  wouldn't fancy the meat,\" said the contractor.    Luncheon over, the three travelers departed with their baggage for the  Chicago Limited, which left from the Pennsylvania Station at  Twenty-third Street. As usual, Koku attracted much attention because of  his size.    The trip to San Francisco was without incident worth narrating and in  due time our friends reached the Golden Gate where they were to go  aboard their steamer. They had to wait a day, during which time Tom and  Mr. Titus made inquiries regarding the first powder shipment. They had  had unexpected good luck, for the explosive, having been sent on ahead  by fast freight, was awaiting them.    \"So we can take it with us on the Bellaconda,\" said, Tom, naming the  vessel on which they were to sail.    The powder was safely stowed away, and our friends having brought their  baggage aboard, putting what was wanted on the voyage in their  staterooms, went out on deck to watch the lines being cast off.    A bell clanged and an officer cried:    \"All ashore that's going ashore!\"    There were hasty good-byes, a scramble on the part of those who had  come to bid friends farewell, and preparations were made to haul in the  gangplank.    Just as the tugs were slowly pushing against the Bellaconda to get her  in motion to move her away from the wharf, there was a shout down the  pier and a taxicab, driven at reckless speed, dashed up.    \"Wait a minute! Hold that gangway. I have a passenger for you!\" cried  the chauffeur.    He pulled up with a screeching of brakes, and a man with a heavy black  beard fairly leaped from the vehicle, running toward the plank which  was all but cast off.    \"My fare! My fare!\" yelled the taxicab driver.    \"Take it out of that! Keep the change!\" cried the bearded man over his  shoulder, tossing a crumpled bill to the chauffeur. And then, clutching  his valise in a firm hand, the belated passenger rushed up the  gangplank just in time to board the steamer which was moving away from  the dock.    \"Close shave--that,\" observed Tom.    \"That's right,\" assented Mr. Titus.    \"Well, we're off for Peru!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as the vessel moved  down the bay.          Chapter VIII    The Bearded Man      Travel to Tom and Mr. Damon presented no novelties. They had been on  too many voyages over the sea, under the sea and even in the air above  the sea to find anything unusual in merely taking a trip on a steamer.    Mr. Titus, though he admitted he had never been in a submarine or  airship, had done considerable traveling about the world in his time,  and had visited many countries, either for business or pleasure, so he  was an old hand at it.    But to Koku, who, since he had been brought from the land where Tom  Swift had been made captive, had gone about but little, everything was  novel, and he did not know at what to look first.    The giant was interested in the ship, in the water, in the passengers,  in the crew and in the sights to be seen as they progressed down the  harbor.    And the big man himself was a source of wonder to all save his own  party. Everywhere he went about the decks, or below, he was followed by  a staring but respectful crowd.  Koku took it all good-naturedly,  however, and even consented to show his great strength by lifting heavy  weights. Once when several sailors were shifting one of the smaller  anchors (a sufficiently heavy one for all that) Koku pushed them aside  with a sweep of his big arm, and, picking up the big \"hook,\" turned to  the second mate and asked:    \"Where you want him?\"    \"Good land, man!\" cried the astonished officer. \"You'll kill yourself!\"    But Koku carried the anchor where it ought to go, and from then on he  was looked up to with awe and admiration by the sailors.    From San Francisco to Callao, Peru (the latter city being the seaport  of Lima, which is situated inland), is approximately nine hundred  miles. But as the Bellaconda was a coasting steamer, and would make  several stops on her trip, it would be more than a week before our  friends would land at Callao, then to proceed to Lima, where they  expected to remain a day or so before striking into the interior to  where the tunnel was being bored through the mountain.    The first day was spent in getting settled, becoming used to their new  surroundings, finding their places and neighbors at table, and in  making acquaintances. There were some interesting men and women aboard  the Bellaconda, and Tom Swift, Mr. Damon and Mr. Titus soon made  friends with them. This usually came about through the medium of Koku,  the giant. Persons seeing him would inquire about him, and when they  learned he was Tom Swift's helper it was an easy topic with which to  open conversation.    Tom told, modestly enough, how he had come to get Koku in his escape  from captivity, but Mr. Damon was not so simple in describing Tom's  feats, so that before many days had passed our hero found himself  regarded as a personage of considerable importance, which was not at  all to his liking.    \"But bless my fountain pen!\" cried Mr. Damon, when Tom objected to so  much notoriety. \"You did it all; didn't you?\"    \"Yes, I know. But these people won't believe it.\"    \"Oh, yes they will!\" said the odd man. \"I'll take good care that they  believe it.\"    \"If any one say it not so, you tell me!\" broke Koku, shaking his huge  fist.    \"No, I guess I'd better keep still,\" said Tom, with a laugh.    The weather was pleasant, if we except a shower or two, and as the  vessel proceeded south, tropical clothing became the order of the day,  while all who could, spent most of their time on deck under the shade  of awnings.    \"Did you ever hear anything more of that fellow, Waddington?\" asked Tom  of Mr. Titus one day.    \"Not a thing. He seems to have dropped out of sight.\"    \"And are your rivals, Blakeson & Grinder, making any trouble?\"    \"Not that I've heard of. Though just what the situation may be down in  Peru I don't know. I fancy everything isn't going just right or my  brother would not be so anxious for me to come on in such a hurry.\"    \"Do you anticipate any real trouble?\"    Mr. Titus paused a moment before answering.    \"Well, yes,\" he said, finally, \"I do!\"    \"What sort?\" asked Tom.    \"That I can't say. I'll be perfectly frank with you, Tom.  You know I  told you at the time that we were in for difficulties. I didn't want  you to go into this thing blindly.\"    \"Oh, I'm not afraid of trouble,\" Tom hastened to assure his friend.  \"I've had more or less of it in my life, and I'm willing to meet it  again. Only I like to know what kind it is.\"    \"Well, I can't tell you--exactly,\" went on the tunnel contractor.  \"Those rivals of ours, Blakeson & Grinder, are unscrupulous fellows.  They feel very bitter about not getting the contract, I hear. And they  would be only too glad to have us fail in the work. That would mean  that they, as the next lowest bidders, would be given the job. And we  would have to make up the difference out of our pockets, as well as  lose all the work we have, so far, put on the tunnel.\"    \"And you don't want that to happen!\"    \"I guess not, my boy! Well, it won't happen if we get there in time  with this new explosive of yours. That will do the business I'm sure.\"    \"I hope so,\" murmured Tom. \"Well, we'll soon see. And now I think I'll  go and write a few letters. We are going to put in at Panama, and I can  mail them there.\"    Tom started for his stateroom, and rapidly put his hand in the inner  pocket of his coat. He drew out a bundle of letters and papers, and, as  he looked at them, a cry of astonishment came from his lips.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Mr. Titus.    \"Matter!\" cried Tom. \"Why here's a letter from Mary--from Mr. Nestor,\"  he went on, as he scanned the familiar handwriting. \"I never opened it!  Let's see--when did I get that?\"    His memory went back to the day of his departure from Shopton when he  had sent Mary the gift, and he recalled that the letter had arrived  just as he was getting into the automobile.    \"I stuck it in my pocket with some other mail,\" he mused, \"and I never  thought of it again until just now. But this is the first time I've  worn this coat since that day. A letter from Mr. Nestor! Probably Mary  wrote, thanking me for the box, and her father addressed the envelope  for her. Well, let's see what it says.\"    Tom retired to the privacy of his stateroom to read the note,"]]]
