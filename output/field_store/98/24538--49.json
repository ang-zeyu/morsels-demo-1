I never  had a letter in my life.\"    \"I sha'n't care for mistakes at all, dear, and no one shall see your  letters but myself,\" said Rose, kissing her. \"I should be as sorry as  you to have Miss Day look at them.\"    Elsie drew out the purse and put it in her friend's hand, saying: \"It  is all my own work, dear Miss Rose; I thought you would value it more  for that.\"    \"And indeed I shall, darling,\" replied Rose, with tears of pleasure in  her eyes. \"It is beautiful in itself, but I shall value it ten times  more because it is your gift, and the work of your own dear little  hands.\"    But the breakfast-bell now summoned them to join the rest of the  family, and, in a few moments after they left the table, the carriage  which was to take Rose to the city was at the door. Rose had endeared  herself to all, old and young, and they were loath to part with her.  One after another bade her an affectionate farewell. Elsie was the  last. Rose pressed her tenderly to her bosom, and kissed her again and  again, saying, in a voice half choked with grief, \"God bless and keep  you, my poor little darling; my dear, dear little Elsie!\"    Elsie could not speak; and the moment the carriage had rolled away with  her friend, she went to her own room, and locking herself in, cried  long and bitterly. She had learned to love Rose very dearly, and to  lean upon her very much; and now the parting from her, with no  certainty of ever meeting her again in this world, was the severest  trial the poor child had ever known.          CHAPTER THIRD         \"The morning blush was lighted up by hope--      The hope of meeting him.\"                                   --Miss LANDON.       \"Unkindness, do thy office; poor heart, break.\"      A week had now passed away since Miss Allison's departure, and Elsie,  to whom it had been a sad and lonely one, was beginning to look eagerly  for her first letter.    \"It is just a week to-day since Rose left,\" remarked Adelaide at the  breakfast table, \"and I think we ought to hear from her soon. She  promised to write on her journey. Ah! here comes Pomp with the letters  now,\" she added, as the servant man entered the room bearing in his  hand the bag in which he always brought the letters of the family from  the office in the neighboring city, whither he was sent every morning.    \"Pomp, you are late this morning,\" said Mrs. Dinsmore.    \"Yes, missus,\" replied the negro, scratching his head, \"de horses am  berry lazy; spec dey's got de spring fever.\"    \"Do make haste, papa, and see if there is not one from Rose,\" said  Adelaide coaxingly, as her father took the bag, and very deliberately  adjusted his spectacles before opening it.    \"Have patience, young lady,\" said he. \"Yes, here is a letter for you,  and one for Elsie,\" tossing them across the table as he spoke.    Elsie eagerly seized hers and ran away to her own room to read it. It  was a feast to her, this first letter, and from such a dear friend,  too. It gave her almost as much pleasure for the moment as Miss Rose's  presence could have afforded.    She had just finished its perusal and was beginning it again, when she  heard Adelaide's voice calling her by name, and the next moment she  entered the room, saying: \"Well, Elsie, I suppose you have read your  letter; and now I have another piece of news for you. Can you guess  what it is?\" she asked, looking at her with a strange smile.    \"Oh! no, Aunt Adelaide; please tell me. Is dear Miss Rose coming back?\"    \"O! nonsense; what a guess!\" said Adelaide. \"No, stranger than that. My  brother Horace--your papa--has actually sailed for America, and is  coming directly home.\"    Elsie sprang up, her cheeks flushed, and her little heart beating  wildly.    \"O Aunt Adelaide!\" she cried, \"is it really true? is he coming? and  will he be here soon?\"    \"He has really started at last; but how soon he will be here I don't  know,\" replied her aunt, turning to leave the room. \"I have told you  all I know about it.\"    Elsie clasped her hands together, and sank down upon a sofa, Miss  Rose's letter, prized so highly a moment before, lying unheeded at her  feet; for her thoughts were far away, following that unknown parent as  he crossed the ocean; trying to imagine how he would look, how he would  speak, what would be his feelings toward her.    \"Oh!\" she asked, with a beating heart, \"_will_ he _love_ me? My own  papa! will he let me love him? will he take me in his arms and call me  his own darling child?\"    But who could answer the anxious inquiry? She must just wait until the  slow wheels of time should bring the much longed-for, yet sometimes  half-dreaded arrival.    Elsie's lessons were but indifferently recited that morning, and Miss  Day frowned, and said in a tone of severity that it did not agree with  her to receive letters; and that, unless she wished her papa to be much  displeased with her on his expected arrival, she must do a great deal  better than that.    She had touched the right chord then; for Elsie, intensely anxious to  please that unknown father, and, if possible, gain his approbation and  affection, gave her whole mind to her studies with such a determined  purpose that the governess could find no more cause for complaint.    But while the child is looking forward to the expected meeting with  such longing affection for him, how is it with the father?    Horace Dinsmore was, like his father, an upright, moral man, who paid  an outward respect to the forms of religion, but cared nothing for the  vital power of godliness; trusted entirely to his morality, and looked  upon Christians as hypocrites and deceivers. He had been told that his  little Elsie was one of these, and, though he would not have  acknowledged it even to himself, it had prejudiced him against her.  Then, too, in common with all the Dinsmores, he had a great deal of  family pride; and, though old Mr. Grayson had been a man of sterling  worth, intelligent, honest, and pious, and had died very wealthy, yet  because he was known to have begun life as a poor boy, the whole family  were accustomed to speak as though Horace had stooped very much in  marrying his heiress.    And Horace himself had come to look upon his early marriage as a piece  of boyish folly, of which he was rather ashamed; and so constantly had  Mr. Dinsmore spoken in his letters of Elsie as \"old Grayson's  grandchild,\" that he had got into the habit of looking upon her as a  kind of disgrace to him; especially as she had always been described to  him as a disagreeable, troublesome child.    He had loved his wife with all the warmth of his passionate nature, and  had mourned bitterly over her untimely death; but years of study,  travel and worldly pleasures had almost banished her image from his  mind, and he seldom thought of her except in connection with the child  for whom he felt a secret dislike.    Scarcely anything but the expected arrival was now spoken or thought of  at Roselands, and Elsie was not the only one to whom old Time seemed to  move with an unusually laggard pace.    But at length a letter came telling them that they might look upon it  as being but one day in advance of its writer; and now all was bustle  and preparation.    \"O mammy, mammy!\" exclaimed Elsie, jumping up and down, and clapping  her hands for joy, as she came in from her afternoon ride, \"just think!  papa, dear papa, will be here to-morrow morning.\"    She seemed wild with delight; but suddenly sobered down, and a look of  care stole over the little face, as the torturing question recurred to  her mind, \"_Will he love me?_\"    She stood quite still, with her eyes fixed thoughtfully, and almost  sadly, upon the floor, while Chloe took off her riding dress and cap  and smoothed her hair. As she finished arranging her dress she clasped  the little form in her arms, and pressed a fond kiss on the fair brow,  thinking to herself that was the sweetest and loveliest little face she  had ever looked upon.    Just at that moment an unusual bustle was heard in the house.    Elsie started, changed color, and stood listening with a throbbing  heart.    Presently little feet were heard running rapidly down the hall, and  Walter, throwing open the door, called out, \"Elsie, he's come!\" and  catching her hand, hurried her along to the parlor door.    \"Stop, stop, Walter,\" she gasped as they reached it; and she leaned  against the wall, her heart throbbing so wildly she could scarcely  breathe.    \"What is the matter?\" said he, \"are you ill? come along;\" and pushing  the door open, he rushed in, dragging her after him.    So over-wrought were the child's feelings that she nearly fainted;  everything in the room seemed to be turning round, and for an instant  she scarcely knew where she was.    But a strange voice asked, \"And who is this?\" and looking up as her  grandfather pronounced her name, she saw a stranger standing before  her--very handsome, and very youthful-looking, in spite of a heavy dark  beard and mustache--who exclaimed hastily, \"What! this great girl _my_  child? really it is enough to make a man feel old.\"    Then, taking her hand, he stooped and coldly kissed her lips.    She was trembling violently, and the very depth of her feelings kept  her silent and still; her hand lay still in his, cold and clammy.    He held it an instant, at the same time gazing searchingly into her  face; then dropped it, saying in a tone of displeasure, \"I am not an  ogre, that you need be so afraid of me; but there, you may go; I will  not keep you in terror any longer.\"    She rushed away to her own room, and there, throwing herself upon the  bed, wept long and wildly. It was the disappointment of a lifelong  hope. Since her earliest recollection she had looked and longed for  this hour; and it seemed as though the little heart would break with  its weight of bitter anguish.    She was all alone, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#8)"],[1,"than the first. Beads were also around the neck of  this one, but are much smaller and of finer quality than those on the  neck of the first. The material, however, seems to be the same. A much  larger amount of paint was found by the side of this than the first.  The bones indicated a person of large frame, who, I think, was about  50 years of age. Everything about this one had the appearance of  superiority over the first. The top of the skull was about 6 inches  below the mark of the plane.    \"I continued the examination, and, after diligent search, found  nothing at the north side of the grave; but, on reaching the east,  found another skeleton, in the same posture as the others, facing the  west. On the right side of this was a rock on which the bones of the  right hand were resting, and on the rock was also a tomahawk, which  had been about 8 inches in length, but was broken into _three_  pieces, and was composed of much better material, and better finished  than the others. Beads were also found on the neck of this, but much  smaller and finer than those of the others. A larger amount of paint  than both of the others was found near this one. The top of the  cranium had been moved by the plow. The bones indicated a person of 40  years of age.    \"There was no appearance of hair discovered; besides, the smaller  bones were almost entirely decomposed, and would crumble when taken  from their bed in the earth. These two circumstances, coupled with the  fact that the farm on which this grave was found was the first settled  in that part of the country, the date of the first deed made from Lord  Granville to John Perkins running back about 150 years (the land still  belonging to the descendants of the same family that first occupied  it), would prove beyond doubt that it is a very old grave.    \"The grave was situated due east and west, in size about 9 by 6 feet,  the line being distinctly marked by the difference in the color of the  soil. It was dug in rich, black loam, and filled around the bodies  with white or yellow sand, which I suppose was carried from the river-  bank, 200 yards distant. The skeletons approximated the walls of the  grave, and contiguous to them was a dark-colored earth, and so  decidedly different was this from all surrounding it, both in quality  and odor, that the line of the bodies could be readily traced. The  odor of this decomposed earth, which had been flesh, was similar to  clotted blood, and would adhere in lumps when compressed in the hand.    \"This was not the grave of the Indian warriors; in those we find pots  made of earth or stone, and all the implements of war, for the warrior  had an idea that after he arose from the dead he would need, in the  'hunting-grounds beyond,' his bow and arrow, war-hatchet, and  scalping-knife.    \"The facts set forth will doubtless convince every Mason who will  carefully read the account of this remarkable burial that the American  Indians were in possession of at least some of the mysteries of our  order, and that it was evidently the grave of Masons, and the three  highest officers in a Masonic lodge. The grave was situated due east  and west; an altar was erected in the center; the south, west, and  east were occupied--_the north was not;_ implements of authority  were near each body. The difference in the quality of the beads, the  tomahawks in one, two, and three pieces, and the difference that the  bodies were placed from the surface, indicate beyond doubt that these  three persons had been buried by Masons, and those, too, that  understood what they were doing.    \"Will some learned Mason unravel this mystery, and inform the Masonic  world how they obtained so much Masonic information?    \"The tomahawks, maxillary bones, some of the teeth, beads, and other  bones, have been forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution at  Washington, D.C., to be placed among the archives of that institution  for exhibition, at which place they may be seen.\"    If Dr. Spainhour's inferences are incorrect, still there is a  remarkable coincidence of circumstances patent to every Mason.        CAVE BURIAL.      Natural or artificial holes in the ground, caverns, and fissures in  rocks have been used as places of deposit for the dead since the  earliest periods of time, and are used up to the present day by not  only the American Indians, but by peoples noted for their mental  elevation and civilization, our cemeteries furnishing numerous  specimens of artificial or partly artificial caves. As to the motives  which have actuated this mode of burial, a discussion would be out of  place at this time, except as may incidentally relate to our own  Indians, who, so far as can be ascertained, simply adopted caves as  ready and convenient resting places for their deceased relatives and  friends.    In almost every State in the Union burial caves have been discovered,  but as there is more or less of identity between them, a few  illustrations will serve the purpose of calling the attention of  observers to the subject.    While in the Territory of Utah, in 1872, the writer discovered a  natural cave not far from the House Range of mountains, the entrance  to which resembled the shaft of a mine. In this the Gosi-Ute Indians  had deposited their dead, surrounded with different articles, until it  was quite filled up; at least it so appeared from the cursory  examination made, limited time preventing a careful exploration. In  the fall of the same year another cave was heard of, from an Indian  guide, near the Nevada border, in the same Territory, and an attempt  made to explore it, which failed for reasons to be subsequently given.  This Indian, a Gosi-Ute, who was questioned regarding the funeral  ceremonies of his tribe, informed the writer that not far from the  very spot where the party were encamped was a large cave in which he  had himself assisted in placing dead members of his tribe. He  described it in detail and drew a rough diagram of its position and  appearance within. He was asked if an entrance could be effected, and  replied that he thought not, as some years previous his people had  stopped up the narrow entrance to prevent game from seeking a refuge  in its vast vaults, for he asserted that it was so large and extended  so far under ground that no man knew its full extent. In  consideration, however, of a very liberal bribe, after many refusals,  he agreed to act as guide. A rough ride of over an hour and the  desired spot was reached. It was found to be almost upon the apex of a  small mountain apparently of volcanic origin, for the hole which was  pointed out appeared to have been the vent of the crater. This  entrance was irregularly circular in form and descended at an angle.  As the Indian had stated, it was completely stopped up with large  stones and roots of sage brush, and it was only after six hours of  uninterrupted, faithful labor that the attempt to explore was  abandoned. The guide was asked if many bodies were therein, and  replied \"Heaps, heaps,\" moving the hands upwards as far as they could  be stretched. There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the  information received, as it was voluntarily imparted.    In a communication received from Dr. A. J McDonald, physician to the  Los Pinos Indian Agency, Colorado, a description is given of crevice  or rock-fissure burial, which follows.    \"As soon as death takes place the event is at once announced by the  medicine-man, and without loss of time the squaws are busily engaged  in preparing the corpse for the grave. This does not take long;  whatever articles of clothing may have been on the body at the time of  death are not removed. The dead man's limbs are straightened out, his  weapons of war laid by his side, and his robes and blankets wrapped  securely and snugly around him, and now everything is ready for  burial. It is the custom to secure, if possible, for the purpose of  wrapping up the corpse, the robes and blankets in which the Indian  died. At the same time that the body is being fitted for interment,  the squaws having immediate care of it, together with all the other  squaws in the neighborhood, keep up a continued chant or dirge, the  dismal cadence of which may, when the congregation of women is large,  be heard for quite a long distance. The death song is not a mere  inarticulate howl of distress; it embraces expressions eulogistic in  character, but whether or not any particular formula of words is  adopted on such occasion is a question which I am unable, with the  materials at my disposal, to determine with any degree of certainty.    \"The next duty falling to the lot of the squaws is that of placing the  dead man on a horse and conducting the remains to the spot chosen for  burial. This is in the cleft of a rock, and, so far as can be  ascertained, it has always been customary among the Utes to select  sepulchres of this character. From descriptions given by Mr. Harris,  who has several times been fortunate enough to discover remains, it  would appear that no superstitious ideas are held by this tribe with  respect to the position in which the body is placed, the space  accommodation of the sepulchre probably regulating this matter; and  from the same source I learn that it is not usual to find the remains  of more than one Indian deposited in one grave. After the body has  been received into the cleft, it is well covered with pieces of rock,  to protect it against the ravages of wild animals. The chant ceases,  the squaws disperse, and the burial ceremonies are at an end. The men  during all this time have not been idle, though they have in no way  participated in the preparation of the body, have not joined the  squaws in chanting praises to the memory of the dead, and have not  even as mere spectators attended the funeral, yet they have had their  duties to perform.
