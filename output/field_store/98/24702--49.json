And the whole was sheathed-in at the sides with the grey metal of which  the Redoubt was builded; and each field was pillared, and floored  beneath the soil, with this same compound of wonder; and so was it  secure, and the monsters could not dig into that mighty garden from  without.    And all of that Underground Land was lit, where needed, by the  Earth-Current, and that same life-stream fructified the soil, and gave  life and blood to the plants and to the trees, and to every bush and  natural thing.    And the making of those Fields had taken maybe a million years, and the  \"dump\" thereof had been cast into the \"Crack,\" whence came the  Earth-Current, and which had bottom beyond all soundings. And this  Underground Country had its own winds and air-currents; so that, to my  memory, it was in no ways connected to the monstrous air-shafts of the  Pyramid; but in this I may be mistaken; for it has not been given to me  to know all that is to be known concerning that vast Redoubt; nor by any  one man could so much knowledge be achieved.    Yet that there were wise and justly promoted winds in that Underground  Country, I do know; for healthful and sweet they were, and in the  corn-fields there was the sweet rustle of grain, and the glad, silken  laughter of poppies, all beneath a warm and happy light. And here, did  the millions walk and take excursion, and go orderly or not, even as in  these days.    And all this have I seen, and the talk of a thousand lovers in the  gardens of that place, comes back to me; and with it all the memory of  my dear one; and of a faint calling that would seem to whisper about me  at times; but so faint and attenuated, that even I, who had the  Night-Hearing, could not catch its import; and so went, listening ever  the more intently. And oft times calling.    Now there was a Law in the Pyramid, tried and healthful, which held that  no male should have freedom to adventure into the Night Land, before the  age of twenty-two; _and no female ever_. Yet that, after such age, if a  youth desired greatly to make the adventure, he should receive three  lectures upon the dangers of which we had knowledge, and a strict  account of the mutilatings and horrid deeds done to those who had so  adventured. And if, after this had passed over him, he still desired,  and if he were accounted healthful and sane; then should he be allowed  to make the adventure; and it was accounted honour to the youth who  should add to the knowledge of the Pyramid.    But to all such as went forth into the danger of the Night Land, there  was set beneath the skin of the inner side of the left forearm, a small  capsule, and when the wound had healed, then might the youth make the  adventure.    And the wherefore of this, was that the spirit of the youth might be  saved, if he were entrapped; for then, upon the honour of his soul, must  he bite forth the capsule, and immediately his spirit would have safety  in death. And by this shall you know somewhat the grim and horrid danger  of the Dark Land.    And this I have set down because later I was to make huge adventure into  those Lands; and even at this time, some thought of the same had come to  me; for always I went listening for that quiet calling; and twice I sent  the Master-Word throbbing solemnly through the everlasting night; yet  this I did no more, without certainty; for the Word must not be used  lightly. But often would I say with my brain-elements \"Mirdath!  Mirdath!\"--sending the name out into the darkness; and sometimes would I  seem to hear the faint thrilling of the aether around me; as though one  answered; but weakly, as it were with a weakened spirit, or by  instrument that lacked of its earth-force.    And thus, for a great while there was no certainty; but only a strange  anxiousness and no clear answer.    Then, one day as I stood by the instruments in the Tower of Observation,  at the thirteenth hour there came the thrilling of beaten aether all  about me, as it were that all the void was disturbed. And I made the  Sign for Silence; so that the men moved not in all the Tower; but bowed  over their breathing-bells, that all disturbance might cease.    And again came the gentle thrilling, and broke out into a clear, low  calling in my brain; and the calling was my name--the old-earth name of  this day, and not the name of that age. And the name smote me, with a  frightenedness of fresh awakening memories. And, immediately, I sent the  Master-Word into the night; and all the aether was full of movement. And  a silence came; and later a beat afar off in the void of night, which  only I in all that great Redoubt could hear, until the heavier  vibrations were come. And in a moment there was all about me the  throbbing of the Master-Word, beating in the night a sure answer. Yet,  before this I knew that Mirdath had called; but now had surety.    And immediately, I said \"Mirdath,\" making use of the instruments; and  there came a swift and beautiful answer; for out of the dark there stole  an old love-name, that she only had ever used to me.    And, presently, I minded me of the men, and signed to them that they  should continue; for the Records must not be broken; and now I had the  communication full established.    And by me stood the Master Monstruwacan, quietly as any young  Monstruwacan, waiting with slips to make any notes that were needful;  and keeping a strict eye upon those others; but not unkindly. And so,  for a space of wonder, I had speech with that girl out in the darkness  of the world, who had knowledge of my name, and of the old-earth  love-name, and named herself Mirdath.    And much I questioned her, and presently to my sorrow; for it seemed  that her name was not truly Mirdath; but Naani; neither had she known my  name; but that in the library of that place where she abode, there had  been a story of one named by my name, and called by that sweet love-name  which she had sent out somewhat ruthless into the night; and the girl's  name had been Mirdath; and when first she, Naani had called, there had  come back to her a cry of Mirdath, Mirdath; and this had minded her so  strangely of that olden story which had stayed in her memory; that she  had answered as the maid in that book might have answered.    And thus did it seem that the utter Romance of my Memory-love had  vanished, and I stood strangely troubled for sorrow of a love of olden  times. Yet, even then I marvelled that any book should have story so  much like to mine; not heeding that the history of all love is writ with  one pen.    Yet, even then in that hour of my strange, and quaintly foolish pain,  there came a thing that set me thrilling; though more afterwards, when I  came to think afresh upon it. For the girl who spoke to me through the  night made some wonder that my voice were not deeper; yet in quiet  fashion, and as one who says a thing, scarce wotting what they say. But  even to me then, there came a sudden hope; for in the olden days of this  Present Age my voice had been very deep. And I said to her that maybe  the man in the book was said to have had a deep tone of speech; but she,  seeming puzzled, said nay; and at that I questioned her the more; but  only to the trouble of her memory and understanding.    And strange must it seem that we two should talk on so trivial a matter,  when there was so much else that we had need to exchange thought upon;  for were a man in this present day to have speech with those who may  live within that red planet of Mars within the sky, scarce could the  wonder of it exceed the wonder of a human voice coming through that  night unto the Great Redoubt, out of all that lost darkness. For,  indeed, this must have been the breaking of, maybe, a million years of  silence. And already, as I came to know later, was the news passing  downward from City to City through all the vast Pyramid; so that the  Hour-Slips were full of the news; and every City eager and excited, and  waiting. And I better known in that one moment, than in all my life  before. For that previous calling, had been but vaguely put about; and  then set to the count of a nature, blown upon over-easily by  spirit-winds of the half-memory of dreams. Though it is indeed true, as  I have set down before this, that my tales concerning the early days of  the world, when the sun was visible, and full of light, had gone down  through all the cities, and had much comment and setting forth in the  Hour-Slips, and were a cause for speech and argument.    Now concerning the voice of this girl coming to us through the darkness  of the world, I will set out that which she had to tell; and this,  indeed, but verified the tellings of our most ancient Records, which had  so long been treated over lightly: There was, it would seem, somewhere  out in the lonesome dark of the Outer Lands, but at what distance none  could ever discover, a second Redoubt; that was a three-sided Pyramid,  and moderate small; being no more than a mile in height, and scarce  three quarters of a mile along the bases.    When this Redoubt was first builded, it had been upon the far shore of a  sea, where now was no sea; and it had been raised by those wandering  humans who had grown weary of wandering, and weary of the danger of  night attacks by the tribes of half-human monsters which began to  inhabit the earth even so early as the days when the half-gloom was upon  the world. And he that had made the plan upon which it was builded, was  one who had seen the Great Redoubt, having lived there in the beginning,  but escaped because of a correction set upon him for his spirit of  irresponsibility, which had made him to cause disturbance among the  orderly ones in the lowest city of the Great Redoubt.

This kind of sea-weed is buoyed  up by bladders of air, which are formed in the duplicatures of its  leaves; and forms immense floating fields of vegetation; the young  ones, branching out from the larger ones, and borne on similar little  air-vessels. It is also found in the warm baths of Patavia; where the  leaves are formed into curious cells or labyrinths for the purpose of  floating on the water. See ulva labyrinthi-formis Lin. Spec. Plant. The  air contained in these cells was found by Dr. Priestley to be sometimes  purer than common air, and sometimes less pure; the air-bladders of fish  seem to be similar organs, and serve to render them buoyant in the water.  In some of these, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, consisting  of a great number of leaves or duplicatures, is found within the air-bag,  which probably secretes this air from the blood of the animal. (Monro.  Physiol. of Fish. p. 28.) To determine whether this air, when first  separated from the blood of the animal or plant, be dephlogisticated air,  is worthy inquiry. The bladder-sena (Colutea), and bladder-nut  (Staphylaea), have their seed-vessels distended with air; the Ketmia has  the upper joint of the stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower  much distended with air; these seem to be analogous to the air-vessel at  the broad end of the egg, and may probably become less pure as the seed  ripens: some, which I tried, had the purity of the surrounding atmosphere.  The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serving the  purpose of respiration to the young chick, some of whose vessels are  spread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it. Many are of opinion that  even the placenta of the human fetus, and cotyledons of quadrupeds, are  respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones.    The air in the hollow stems of grasses, and of some umbelliferous plants,  bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in some of the bones of  birds; supplying the place of the pith, which shrivels up after it has  performed its office of protruding the young stem or feather. Some of  these cavities of the bones are said to communicate with the lungs in  birds. Phil. Trans.    The air-bladders of fish are nicely adapted to their intended purpose;  for though they render them buoyant near the surface without the labour  of using their fins, yet, when they rest at greater depths, they are no  inconvenience, as the increased pressure of the water condenses the air  which they contain into less space. Thus, if a cork or bladder of air was  immersed a very great depth in the ocean, it would be so much compressed,  as to become specifically as heavy as the water, and would remain there.  It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-ship  of his own construction, miscarried from not attending to this  circumstance: it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him,  if he descended much lower than he expected, was condensed into so small  a space as not to render the ship buoyant when he endeavoured to ascend.]              Her _secret_ vows the Cyprian Queen approves,  410  And hovering halcyons guard her infant-loves;          Each in his floating cradle round they throng,          And dimpling Ocean bears the fleet along.--          Thus o'er the waves, which gently bend and swell,          Fair GALATEA steers her silver shell;    415  Her playful Dolphins stretch the silken rein,          Hear her sweet voice, and glide along the main.          As round the wild meandering coast she moves          By gushing rills, rude cliffs, and nodding groves;          Each by her pine the Wood-nymphs wave their locks,  420  And wondering Naiads peep amid the rocks;          Pleased trains of Mermaids rise from coral cells,          Admiring Tritons sound their twisted shells;          Charm'd o'er the car pursuing Cupids sweep,          Their snow-white pinions twinkling in the deep;  425  And, as the lustre of her eye she turns,          Soft sighs the Gale, and amorous Ocean burns.            On DOVE'S green brink the fair TREMELLA stood,          And view'd her playful image in the flood;      [_Tremella_, l. 427. Clandestine marriage. I have frequently observed  fungusses of this Genus on old rails and on the ground to become a  transparent jelly, after they had been frozen in autumnal mornings; which  is a curious property, and distinguishes them from some other vegetable  mucilage; for I have observed that the paste, made by boiling wheat-flour  in water, ceases to be adhesive after having been frozen. I suspected  that the Tremella Nostoc, or star-jelly, also had been thus produced; but  have since been well informed, that the Tremella Nostoc is a mucilage  voided by Herons after they have eaten frogs; hence it has the appearance  of having been pressed through a hole; and limbs of frogs are said  sometimes to be found amongst it; it is always seen upon plains or by the  sides of water, places which Herons generally frequent.    Some of the Fungusses are so acrid, that a drop of their juice blisters  the tongue; others intoxicate those who eat them. The Ostiacks in Siberia  use them for the latter purpose; one Fungus of the species, Agaricus  muscarum, eaten raw; or the decoction of three of them, produces  intoxication for 12 or 16 hours. History of Russia. V. 1. Nichols. 1780.  As all acrid plants become less so, if exposed to a boiling heat, it  is probable the common mushroom may sometimes disagree from being not  sufficiently stewed. The Oftiacks blister their skin by a fungus found on  Birch-trees; and use the Agiricus officin. for Soap. ib.    There was a dispute whether the fungusses should be classed in the animal  or vegetable department. Their animal taste in cookery, and their animal  smell when burnt, together with their tendency to putrefaction, insomuch  that the Phallus impudicus has gained the name of stink-horn; and lastly,  their growing and continuing healthy without light, as the Licoperdon  tuber or truffle, and the fungus vinosus or mucor in dark cellars, and  the esculent mushrooms on beds covered thick with straw, would seem to  shew that they approach towards the animals, or make a kind of isthmus  connecting the two mighty kingdoms of animal and of vegetable nature.]              To each rude rock, lone dell, and echoing grove  430  Sung the sweet sorrows of her _secret_ love.          \"Oh, stay!--return!\"--along the sounding shore          Cry'd the sad Naiads,--she return'd no more!--          Now girt with clouds the sullen Evening frown'd,          And withering Eurus swept along the ground;  435  The misty moon withdrew her horned light,          And sunk with Hesper in the skirt of night;            No dim electric streams, (the northern dawn,)          With meek effulgence quiver'd o'er the lawn;          No star benignant shot one transient ray  440  To guide or light the wanderer on her way.          Round the dark craggs the murmuring whirlwinds blow,          Woods groan above, and waters roar below;          As o'er the steeps with pausing foot she moves,          The pitying Dryads shriek amid their groves;  445  She flies,--she stops,--she pants--she looks behind,          And hears a demon howl in every wind.          --As the bleak blast unfurls her fluttering vest,          Cold beats the snow upon her shuddering breast;          Through her numb'd limbs the chill sensations dart,  450  And the keen ice bolt trembles at her heart.          \"I sink, I fall! oh, help me, help!\" she cries,          Her stiffening tongue the unfinish'd sound denies;          Tear after tear adown her cheek succeeds,          And pearls of ice bestrew the glittering meads;  455  Congealing snows her lingering feet surround,          Arrest her flight, and root her to the ground;          With suppliant arms she pours the silent prayer;          Her suppliant arms hang crystal in the air;          Pellucid films her shivering neck o'erspread,  460  Seal her mute lips, and silver o'er her head,          Veil her pale bosom, glaze her lifted hands,          And shrined in ice the beauteous statue stands.          --DOVE'S azure nymphs on each revolving year          For fair TREMELLA shed the tender tear;  465  With rush-wove crowns in sad procession move,          And sound the sorrowing shell to hapless love.\"            Here paused the MUSE,--across the darken'd pole          Sail the dim clouds, the echoing thunders roll;          The trembling Wood-nymphs, as the tempest lowers,  470  Lead the gay Goddess to their inmost bowers;          Hang the mute lyre the laurel shade beneath,          And round her temples bind the myrtle wreath.          --Now the light swallow with her airy brood          Skims the green meadow, and the dimpled flood;  475  Loud shrieks the lone thrush from his leafless thorn, "]]]
