And Pegana is a place all white with the  peaks of mountains, on each of them a god, and the people shall  lie upon the slopes of the mountains each under the god that he  hath worshipped most when his lot was in the Worlds. And there  shall music beyond thy dreaming come drifting through the scent  of all the orchards in the Worlds, with somewhere someone singing  an old song that shall be as a half-remembered thing. And there  shall be gardens that have always sunlight, and streams that are  lost in no sea beneath skies for ever blue. And there shall be no  rain nor no regrets. Only the roses that in highest Pegana have  achieved their prime shall shed their petals in showers at thy  feet, and only far away on the forgotten earth shall voices drift  up to thee that cheered thee in thy childhood about the gardens of  thy youth. And if thou sighest for any memory of earth because thou  hearest unforgotten voices, then will the gods send messengers on  wings to soothe thee in Pegana, saying to them: \"There one sigheth  who hath remembered Earth.\" And they shall make Pegana more seductive  for thee still, and they shall take thee by the hand and whisper in  thine ear till the old voices are forgot.    \"'And besides the flowers of Pegana there shall have climbed by  then until it hath reached to Pegana the rose that clambered about  the house where thou wast born. Thither shall also come the  wandering echoes of all such music as charmed thee long ago.    \"'Moreover, as thou sittest on the orchard lawns that clothe  Pegana's mountains, and as thou hearkenest to melody that sways  the souls of the gods, there shall stretch away far down beneath  thee the great unhappy Earth, till gazing from rapture upon sorrows  thou shalt be glad that thou wert dead.    \"'And from the three great mountains that stand aloof and over all  the others--Grimbol, Zeebol, and Trehagobol--shall blow the wind  of the morning and the wind of all the day, borne upon the wings  of all the butterflies that have died upon the Worlds, to cool the  gods and Pegana.    \"'Far through Pegana a silvery fountain, lured upward by the gods  from the Central Sea, shall fling its waters aloft, and over the  highest of Pegana's peaks, above Trehagobol, shall burst into  gleaming mists, to cover Highest Pegana, and make a curtain about  the resting-place of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    \"'Alone, still and remote below the base of one of the inner  mountains, lieth a great blue pool.    \"'Whoever looketh down into its waters may behold all his life  that was upon the Worlds and all the deeds that he hath done.    \"'None walk by the pool and none regard its depths, for all in  Pegana have suffered and all have sinned some sin, and it lieth in  the pool.    \"'And there is no darkness in Pegana, for when night hath conquered  the sun and stilled the Worlds and turned the white peaks of Pegana  into grey then shine the blue eyes of the gods like sunlight on the  sea, where each god sits upon his mountain.    \"'And at the Last, upon some afternoon, perhaps in summer, shall the  gods say, speaking to the gods: \"What is the likeness of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  and what THE END?\"    \"'And then shall MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI draw back with his hand the mists  that cover his resting, saying: \"This is the Face of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  and this THE END.\"'\"    Then said the people to the prophet: \"Shall not black hills draw  round in some forsaken land, to make a vale-wide cauldron wherein  the molten rock shall seethe and roar, and where the crags of  mountains shall be hurled upward to the surface and bubble and go  down again, that there our enemies may boil for ever?\"    And the prophet answered: \"It is writ large about the bases of  Pegana's mountains, upon which sit the gods: 'Thine Enemies Are  Forgiven.\"'        THE SAYINGS OF IMBAUN      The Prophet of the gods said: \"Yonder beside the road there  sitteth a false prophet; and to all who seek to know the hidden  days he saith: 'Upon the morrow the King shall speak to thee as  his chariot goeth by.'\"    Moreover, all the people bring him gifts, and the false prophet  hath more to listen to his words than hath the Prophet of the  gods.    Then said Imbaun: \"What knoweth the Prophet of the gods? I know  only that I and men know naught concerning the gods or aught  concerning men. Shall I, who am their prophet, tell the people  this?    \"For wherefore have the people chosen prophets but that they  should speak the hopes of the people, and tell the people that  their hopes be true?\"    The false prophet saith: \"Upon the morrow the king shall speak to  thee.\"    Shall not I say: \"Upon The Morrow the gods shall speak with thee  as thou restest upon Pegana?\"    So shall the people be happy, and know that their hopes be true  who have believed the words that they have chosen a prophet to say.    But what shall know the Prophet of the gods, to whom none may come  to say: \"Thy hopes are true,\" for whom none may make strange signs  before his eyes to quench his fear of death, for whom alone the  chaunt of his priests availeth naught?    The Prophet of the gods hath sold his happiness for wisdom, and  hath given his hopes for the people.    Said also Imbaun: \"When thou art angry at night observe how calm  be the stars; and shall small ones rail when there is such a calm  among the great ones? Or when thou art angry by day regard the  distant hills, and see the calm that doth adorn their faces. Shalt  thou be angry while they stand so serene?    \"Be not angry with men, for they are driven as thou art by  Dorozhand. Do bullocks goad one another on whom the same yoke  rests?    \"And be not angry with Dorozhand, for then thou beatest thy bare  fingers against iron cliffs.    \"All that is is so because it was to be. Rail not, therefore,  against what is, for it was all to be.\"    And Imbaun said: \"The Sun ariseth and maketh a glory about all the  things that he seeth, and drop by drop he turneth the common dew  to every kind of gem. And he maketh a splendour in the hills.    \"And also man is born. And there rests a glory about the gardens  of his youth. Both travel afar to do what Dorozhand would have  them do.    \"Soon now the sun will set, and very softly come twinkling in the  stillness all the stars.    \"Also man dieth. And quietly about his grave will all the mourners  weep.    \"Will not his life arise again somewhere in all the worlds? Shall  he not again behold the gardens of his youth? Or does he set to  end?\"        OF HOW IMBAUN SPAKE OF DEATH TO THE KING      There trod such pestilence in Aradec that, the King as he looked  abroad out of his palace saw men die. And when the King saw Death  he feared that one day even the King should die. Therefore he  commanded guards to bring before him the wisest prophet that  should be found in Aradec.    Then heralds came to the temple of All the gods save One, and  cried aloud, having first commanded silence, crying: \"Rhazahan,  King over Aradec, Prince by right of Ildun and Ildaun, and Prince  by conquest of Pathia, Ezek, and Azhan, Lord of the Hills, to the  High Prophet of All the gods save One sends salutations.\"    Then they bore him before the King.    The King said unto the prophet: \"O Prophet of All the gods save  One, shall I indeed die?\"    And the prophet answered: \"O King! thy people may not rejoice for  ever, and some day the King will die.\"    And the King answered: \"This may be so, but certainly thou shalt  die. It may be that one day I shall die, but till then the lives  of the people are in my hands.\"    Then guards led the prophet away.    And there arose prophets in Aradec who spake not of death to  Kings.        OF OOD      Men say that if thou comest to Sundari, beyond all the plains, and  shalt climb to his summit before thou art seized by the avalanche  which sitteth always on his slopes, that then there lie before thee  many peaks. And if thou shalt climb these and cross their valleys  (of which there be seven and also seven peaks) thou shalt come at  last to the land of forgotten hills, where amid many valleys and  white snow there standeth the \"Great Temple of One god Only.\"    Therein is a dreaming prophet who doeth naught, and a drowsy  priesthood about him.    These be the priests of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    Within the temple it is forbidden to work, also it is forbidden to  pray. Night differeth not from day within its doors. They rest as  MANA rests. And the name of their prophet is Ood.    Ood is a greater prophet than any of all the prophets of Earth,  and it hath been said by some that were Ood and his priests to  pray chaunting all together and calling upon MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  that MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI would then awake, for surely he would hear  the prayers of his own prophet--then would there be Worlds no more.    There is also another way to the land of forgotten hills, which is  a smooth road and a straight, that lies through the heart of the  mountains. But for certain hidden reasons it were better for thee  to go by the peaks and snow, even though thou shouldst perish by  the way, that thou shouldst seek to come to the house of Ood by  the smooth, straight road.        THE RIVER      There arises a river in Pegana that is neither a river of water  nor yet a river of fire, and it flows through the skies and the  Worlds to the Rim of the Worlds, a river of silence. Through all  the Worlds are sounds, the noises of moving, and the echoes of  voices and song; but upon the River is no sound ever heard, for  there all echoes die.    The River arises out of the drumming of Skarl, and flows for ever  between banks of thunder, until it comes to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#8)"],[1,"ountain, to a  camping-ground, six miles farther on, called Adhai. Here we were at  the station originally assigned for the first day's march, and, for  the first and last time during the whole journey, I pitched the tent.  The higher we ascended the hill the more abundant became the wooding,  and green grass for the first time was visible amongst the stones.  This freshness was attributed to a recent fall of rain. Altitude, by  boiling thermometer, 4577 feet.    22d.--I sent all the freshest camels off to Goriat for the remaining  property, with orders that everybody should return on the following  day. At this height the temperature of the air was very delightful,  the range at noon being only 79°. I spent the whole day  specimen-hunting, and found the rocks were full of fossil shells. I  killed a new snake or variety of _Psammophis sibilans_, and shot an  interesting little antelope, _Oreotragus saltatrix_, the  \"klip-springer\" of the Cape Colonist, as well as hyraxes and various  small birds, which we duly preserved. My collections in this country  were sent by Lieutenant Burton to the Asiatic Society's Museum,  Calcutta, and have been described in their journals by Mr E. Blyth,  the Curator.    23d and 24th.--Passed without anybody appearing, and I was becoming  much alarmed at repeated stories I heard of the Abban's dishonesty. It  then transpired that Sumunter was heavily in debt, and one of his  principal creditors was at Bunder Gori detaining him there. A pony had  been hired for my riding, and on this animal I wished to send Imam  back, to find out the truth of everything, and to return to me the  following day; but the wicked young prince, Abdullah, got wind of my  intention, and had the pony driven away, so that the unfortunate Imam  had to walk.    25th.--Still nobody came. I now despatched the interpreter on the same  mission, and was left alone with the young prince and two or three  camel-drivers. After a little while had elapsed, a number of savage  hungry-looking men came up the hill and settled themselves in my  encampment, squatting on the date-bags and clamouring for food. The  prince and camel-drivers joined them, and became so importunate, I was  obliged to rebuke them with angry demonstration. No sooner did they  see me vexed than they began hovering tauntingly around me, jeering  and vociferating in savage delight at the impunity they enjoyed in  irritating me when all alone and helpless. However, I stood by the  date and rice bags with my gun, and prevented anybody coming near me.  The prince and camel-men now seeing me determined, and no farther  discomposed by their manoeuvres, came supplicating for their daily  rations. I gave it them at once, but could not satisfy them; they must  have some more for all their brothers (meaning the _blackguards_ who  had just arrived), or they would strike work. This stirred my blood; I  took back what I had given, and resolutely declined to be passively  cajoled out of anything, let happen what may. They saw I was  determined not to submit to them; and suddenly, as if the same thought  struck every one of them at the same instant, they dashed down the  hill, flying over the bushes and stones in their way, with yells and  shouts, and, seizing a goat from a neighbouring flock, killed and  quartered it without a moment's hesitation. At this juncture, just as  the robbed shepherd came crying to me for the price of his goat, Imam  arrived from Goriat, and tried to reason with him that it was no  business of mine, and I could not be expected to pay it. The injured  man then swore he would have justice done him at the sultan's hands,  and all yelled again for dates and rice. As they could not get it, the  young prince, ever full of boyish tricks, now seized up a mussack  (water-skin), and said I should have no more water until I complied  with their demands. The others, following his example, picked up as  many more as they could find, and left but one mussack remaining. This  one I immediately captured, and requested Imam to fill from a spring  farther down the hill; but the men, thus far outdone, rather than  allow it, said they would kill him if he dared attempt to go now. As  Imam showed alarm at their wild threats, I took the water-skin myself  and walked off to fill it, upon which the savages threw themselves out  in line, flourishing their spears and bows, and declared they would  kill me if I persisted in going. On I went, however, and had just  passed through their line, when the sultan's eldest son, Mohamed Aul,  fortunately arrived, and rebuked them, together with his brother, for  allowing me to be ill-treated. Finding Mohamed Aul very reasonable and  obliging, I begged him to send Abdullah away as a nuisance, for I  could never permit him to eat any more salt of mine.    Imam now disclosed to me the results of his investigations at Goriat  and Bunder Gori. The Abban, as I had heard before, was detained there  by a creditor to whom he had contracted debts in Aden, and now, in  part liquidation of them, he had given away all my salt, the twenty  rupees he took for hiring donkeys, several pieces of cloth, and he had  changed my good rice for bad; and, knowing Farhan to be cognisant of  all his villanies, had tried by bribes to induce him to desert. The  sultan now arrived, and excused his long absence, saying that he had  lost the time in fruitless endeavours to induce Sumunter to come with  him. He said he had been remonstrating with Sumunter, and thought him  very culpable in not obeying me. Hoping the sultan was in earnest in  what he said, I now told him of all I had seen and heard about  Sumunter, and begged he would assist me in sending him back to Aden,  for no reliance could possibly be placed on a man who had proved  himself so dishonest and unprincipled as he was. The interpreter also  thought this would be a good plan, and advised my employing the  sultan's brother Hasan as abban or protector in his stead. However,  the sultan said he could not undo what the English had done in Aden,  but said if I wished he would send for Sumunter and rebuke him in my  presence. I replied that I thought he could not get Sumunter to leave  Bunder Gori, or he should have done so ere this. This touched his  pride, and he raised his body indignantly, and said, \"If I command, he  must obey.\" \"Then, for goodness' sake,\" said I, \"order him with  all--all my things at once, and lose no more time.\"    The following day they all arrived, and Sumunter with them, riding on  a pony. I felt much incensed as the Abban came cringing up to me, and  proclaimed him in presence of the sultan and all my men a traitor and  robber, mentioning all his villanies in detail, and begging he would  leave my camp at once, for I could not travel with him. He appeared  very humble, and denied flatly all the accusations I brought against  him. Upon this I begged the sultan, flattering him with his great  renown for administering justice, that he would do me justice as his  guest. He said he was willing to do anything for me if I would direct  the way in which I wished him to proceed; he did not understand the  English law, and I must submit to Somali methods. This was agreed to,  and we all assembled in my tent, and arranged the court as follows:--I  sat at the gable end of the tent with Imam, Ahmed, and Farhan, with  Sumunter facing us. The sultan mounted on the bales of cloth, and all  his retainers and princes, and my camel-drivers, sat in a group on the  ground at his feet.    In opening the proceedings of the prosecution, I first said to  Sumunter--    _P. Speke_.--\"Where is the salt which you confess came with us to  Goriat, and which you have told me daily you would give; but as yet,  though everything, you say, is in the camp, it has not arrived?\"    _D. Sumunter_.--\"I did not bring it because it was so heavy, and  thought you would not want it.\"    _P._--\"Then why did you not land it at Goriat, and give it me there,  or why did you even buy it at all at Aden if it was of no use?\"    _D._--\"Because the Nahkoda took it to Bunder Gori.\"    After a few more questions and answers, and the subject was exhausted,  the sultan (judge), who had been sitting in silence with his head  buried in his hands, now gave a grunt and motioned us to continue.    _P._--\"Where are the bales of cloth which by my account and Imam's are  missing?\"    _D._--\"I did not take them; somebody else must have.\"    _P._--\" They were in your charge, and you are answerable for them;  besides which, Farhan here knows you gave them away.\"    _Judge_.--\"Ahem!\" and the prosecution continued.    _P._--\"Where are the twenty rupees I gave you for hiring donkeys, and  which I particularly ordered should not be expended for any other  purpose?\"    Sumunter, putting his hand fixedly in his breast, said, \"I've got  them; they are all right. I will give them to you presently.\"    _Speke_.--\"No! give them to me now; I want them this instant.\"    Sumunter, confused, and fumbling at his pocket, much to the delight of  all the court, who burst with laughter, said, \"No! I've left them at  home in Bunder Gori, and will give them by-and-by.\"    _Judge_.--\"Ahem!\" and the prosecution continued.    _P._--\"Why did you change my good rice for bad?\" (opening and showing  the contents of the nearest sack).    _D._--\"I thought it would not signify: bad rice is good enough for the  camel-drivers, and I have left enough good for your consumption. An  old friend asked me for it, and I did it to oblige him.\"    _Judge_.--\"Ahem!\" and the prosecution continued.    _P._--\"Why did you attempt to bribe Farhan to leave my service, and  say nothing to me about it?\"    _D._--\"Farhan is a bad man; and I was afraid he would steal your  things.\"    _Judge_.--\"Ahem!\"    Thus ended the prosecution and defence. The sultan raised his head,  and in answer to my appeal as to what judgment he would give, calmly  said, he could see no harm in what had been "]]]
