Therefore, although the originators  of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their  disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects.  They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in  opposition to the progressive historical development of the  proletariat.  They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently,  to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms.  They still dream of experimental realisation of their social  Utopias, of founding isolated \"phalansteres,\" of establishing  \"Home Colonies,\"  of setting up a \"Little Icaria\"--duodecimo  editions of the New Jerusalem--and to realise all these castles  in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and  purses of the bourgeois.  By degrees they sink into the category  of the reactionary conservative Socialists depicted above,  differing from these only by more systematic pedantry, and  by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous  effects of their social science.    They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the  part of the working class; such action, according to them, can  only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.    The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France,  respectively, oppose the Chartists and the Reformistes.        IV.  POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE  VARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES    Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the  existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England  and the Agrarian Reformers in America.    The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims,  for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working  class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent  and take care of the future of that movement.  In France the  Communists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats, against the  conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the  right to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and  illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.    In Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight  of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements,  partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of  radical bourgeois.    In Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian  revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that  party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.    In Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a  revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal  squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.    But they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the  working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile  antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the  German workers may straightaway use, as so many weapons against  the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the  bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy,  and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in  Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately  begin.    The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because  that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that  is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions  of European civilisation, and with a much more developed  proletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of  France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois  revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately  following proletarian revolution.    In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary  movement against the existing social and political order of  things.    In all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading  question in each, the property question, no matter what its  degree of development at the time.    Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of  the democratic parties of all countries.    The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.  They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by  the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.  Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.  The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.  They have a world to win.

He did not scout the idea as  much as I could have wished, but held out hopes to me that the roof  would \"kep it down.\" I shall never dare to trust the baby out of my  sight, lest he should be blown away; and I have a plan for securing his  cradle, by putting large heavy stones in it, somewhere out of his way,  so that he need not be hurt by them. Some of the houses are built of  \"cob,\" especially those erected in the very early days, when sawn timber  was rare and valuable: this material is simply wet clay with chopped  tussocks stamped in. It makes very thick walls, and they possess the  great advantage of being cool in summer and warm in winter. Whilst the  house is new nothing can be nicer; but, in a few years, the hot winds  dry up the clay so much, that it becomes quite pulverized; and a lady  who lives in one of these houses told me, that during a high wind she  had often seen the dust from the walls blowing in clouds about the  rooms, despite of the canvas and paper, and with all the windows  carefully closed.    Next week F---- is going up to the station, to unpack and arrange a  little, and baby and I are going to be taken care of at Ilam, the most  charming place I have yet seen. I am looking forward to my visit there  with great pleasure.          Letter VIII: Pleasant days at Ilam.      Ilam, April 1866. We leave this to-morrow for the station in the most  extraordinary conveyance you ever saw. Imagine a flat tray with two low  seats in it, perched on four very high wheels, quite innocent of any  step or means of clambering in and out, and drawn, tandem-fashion,  by two stout mares; one of which has a little foal by her side. The  advantage of this vehicle is that it is very light, and holds a good  deal of luggage. We hope to accomplish the distance--fifty miles--in a  day, easily.    Although this is not my first visit to Ilam, I don't think I have ever  described it to you. The house is of wood, two storeys high, and came  out from England! It is built on a brick foundation, which is quite  unusual here. Inside, it is exactly like a most charming English house,  and when I first stood in the drawing-room it was difficult to believe:  that I was at the other end of the world. All the newest books, papers,  and periodicals covered the tables, the newest music lay on the piano,  whilst a profusion of English greenhouse flowers in Minton's loveliest  vases added to the illusion. The Avon winds through the grounds, which  are very pretty, and are laid out in the English fashion; but in spite  of the lawn with its croquet-hoops and sticks, and the beds of flowers  in all their late summer beauty, there is a certain absence of the  stiffness and trimness of English pleasure-grounds, which shows that  you have escaped from the region of conventionalities. There are thick  clumps of plantations, which have grown luxuriantly, and look as if they  had always been there. A curve of the opposite bank is a dense mass of  native flax bushes, with their tall spikes of red blossom filling  the air with a scent of honey, and attracting all the bees in the  neighbourhood. Ti-ti palms are dotted here and there, and give a foreign  and tropical appearance to the whole. There is a large kitchen garden  and orchard, with none of the restrictions of high walls and locked  gates which fence your English peaches and apricots.    The following is our receipt for killing time at Ilam:--After breakfast,  take the last _Cornhill_ or _Macmillan_, put on a shady hat, and sit or  saunter by the river-side under the trees, gathering any very tempting  peach or apricot or plum or pear, until luncheon; same thing until five  o'clock tea; then cross the river by a rustic bridge, ascend some turf  steps to a large terrace-like meadow, sheltered from the north-west  winds by a thick belt of firs, blue gums, and poplars, and play croquet  on turf as level as a billiard-table until dinner. At these games the  cockatoo always assists, making himself very busy, waddling after his  mistress all over the field, and climbing up her mallet whenever he  has an opportunity. \"Dr. Lindley\"--so called from his taste for pulling  flowers to pieces--apparently for botanical purposes--is the tamest and  most affectionate of birds, and I do not believe he ever bit any one in  his life; he will allow himself to be pulled about, turned upside down,  scratched under his wings, all with the greatest indifference, or rather  with the most positive enjoyment. One evening I could not play croquet  for laughing at his antics. He took a sudden dislike to a little rough  terrier, and hunted him fairly off the ground at last, chasing him all  about, barking at him, and digging his beak into the poor dog's paw. But  the \"Doctor's\" best performance is when he imitates a hawk. He reserves  this fine piece of acting until his mistress is feeding her poultry;  then, when all the hens and chickens, turkeys, and pigeons are in the  quiet enjoyment of their breakfast or supper, the peculiar shrill cry  of a hawk is heard overhead, and the Doctor is seen circling in the air,  uttering a scream occasionally. The fowls never find out that it is a  hoax, but run to shelter, cackling in the greatest alarm--hens clucking  loudly for their chicks, turkeys crouching under the bushes, the pigeons  taking refuge in their house; as soon as the ground is quite clear,  Cocky changes his wild note for peals of laughter from a high tree,  and finally alighting on the top of a hen-coop filled with trembling  chickens, remarks in a suffocated voice, \"You'll be the death of me.\"    I must reverse the proverb about the ridiculous and the sublime, and  finish my letter by telling you of Ilam's chief outdoor charm: from  all parts of the garden and grounds I can feast my eyes on the glorious  chain of mountains which I have before told you of, and my bedroom  window has a perfect panoramic view of them. I watch them under all  their changes of tint, and find each new phase the most beautiful. In  the very early morning I have often stood shivering at my window to see  the noble outline gradually assuming shape, and finally standing out  sharp and clear against a dazzling sky; then, as the sun rises, the  softest rose-coloured and golden tints touch the highest peaks, the  shadows deepening by the contrast. Before a \"nor'-wester\" the colours  over these mountains and in the sky are quite indescribable; no one but  Turner could venture upon such a mixture of pale sea-green with deep  turquoise blue, purple with crimson and orange. One morning an arch-like  appearance in the clouds over the furthest ranges was pointed out to me  as the sure forerunner of a violent gale from the north-west, and the  prognostic was fulfilled. It was formed of clouds of the deepest and  richest colours; within its curve lay a bare expanse of a wonderful  green tint, crossed by the snowy _silhouette_ of the Southern Alps.  A few hours afterwards the mountains were quite hidden by mist, and a  furious gale of hot wind was shaking the house as if it must carry it  off into the sky; it blew so continuously that the trees and shrubs  never seemed to rise for a moment against it.    These hot winds affect infants and children a good deal, and my baby is  not at all well. However, his doctor thinks the change to the station  will set him all right again, so we are hurrying off much sooner than  our kind friends here wish, and long before the little house in the  hills can possibly be made comfortable, though F---- is working very  hard to get things settled for us.          Letter IX: Death in our new home--New Zealand children.      Broomielaw, Malvern Hills, May 1866. I do not like to allow the first  Panama steamer to go without a line from me: this is the only letter I  shall attempt, and it will be but a short and sad one, for we are still  in the first bitterness of grief for the loss of our dear little baby.  After I last wrote to you he became very ill, but we hoped that his  malady was only caused by the unhealthiness of Christchurch during the  autumn, and that he would soon revive and get on well in this pure,  beautiful mountain air. We consequently hurried here as soon as ever we  could get into the house, and whilst the carpenters were still in it.  Indeed, there was only one bedroom ready for us when I arrived. The  poor little man rallied at first amazingly; the weather was exquisitely  bright and sunny, and yet bracing. Baby was to be kept in the open air  as much as possible, so F---- and I spent our days out on the downs near  the house, carrying our little treasure by turns: but all our care was  fruitless: he got another and more violent attack about a fortnight ago,  and after a few hours of suffering he was taken to the land where pain  is unknown. During the last twelve hours of his life, as I sat before  the fire with him on my lap, poor F----kneeling in a perfect agony of  grief by my side, my greatest comfort was in looking at that exquisite  photograph from Kehren's picture of the \"Good Shepherd,\" which hangs  over my bedroom mantelpiece, and thinking that our sweet little lamb  would soon be folded in those Divine, all-embracing Arms. It is not  a common picture; and the expression of the Saviour's face is most  beautiful, full of such immense feminine compassion and tenderness that  it makes me feel more vividly, \"In all our sorrows He is afflicted.\" In  such a grief as this I find the conviction of the reality and depth of  the Divine sympathy is my only true comfort; the tenderest human love  falls short of the feeling that, without any words to express our  sorrow, God knows all about it; that He would not willingly afflict or  grieve us, and that therefore the anguish which wrings our hearts is  absolutely necessary in some mysterious way for"]]]
