There were no roads across the mountains, only    rough paths used by the mountaineers, who constantly attacked    Hannibal's soldiers, bursting out suddenly upon them from behind a    turn in the trail, or rolling huge rocks upon them from above. The    elephants, the horses, and the baggage animals of the army were    frightened, and in the tumult many of them slipped over the precipices    and were dashed on the rocks below. For five days the army toiled    upward, and then rested two days on the summit of the pass.      [Illustration: THE ALPS THAT HANNIBAL HAD TO CROSS]      Although the road down into Italy was short, it was steep, and the    paths were slippery with ice and with snow trodden into slush by    thousands of men and animals. In one place there had been a landslide,    and the road along the rocky slope was cut away for a thousand feet.    In order to build a new road it was necessary to crack the rocks. This    the soldiers did by making huge fires and pouring wine over the heated    surface. At last, worn out, ragged, and half starved, the army reached    the plains of Italy, but with a loss of half its men.    HOW HANNIBAL WON A VICTORY. The first great battle with the Romans was    fought on the river Trebia in northern Italy, and in it Hannibal    showed how easily he could outwit and destroy a Roman army. It was a    winter's day and the river was swollen by rains. The two camps lay on    opposite banks. In the early morning Hannibal sent across the river a    body of horsemen to attack the Roman camp and draw the Romans into a    battle. At the same time he ordered his other soldiers to eat    breakfast, to build fires before their tents to warm themselves, and    to rub their bodies with oil, so that they might be strong for the    coming fight.      The Romans were suddenly roused by the attack of the Carthaginian    horsemen, and, without waiting for food, moved out of camp, chasing    the horsemen toward the river. Into its icy waters the Romans waded    breast-high, and when they came up on the opposite bank they were    benumbed with cold. As soon as Hannibal knew that the Romans had    crossed the river he attacked them fiercely with all his troops. Two    thousand men whom he had placed in ambush fell upon the rear of their    line. Their allies were frightened by a charge of elephants. Seeing    that destruction was certain, ten thousand of the best soldiers broke    through the Carthaginian line and marched away. All the rest of the    army was destroyed.    ROMAN ENDURANCE. This was not the last of the Roman defeats. Two other    armies were destroyed by Hannibal during the next two years. In the    battle of Cannae nearly seventy thousand Romans, including eighty    senators, were slain. The news filled the city with weeping women, but    the senate did not think of yielding. When their allies deserted them,    they besieged the faithless cities, took them, beheaded the rulers,    and sold the inhabitants into slavery.      They did not dare to fight Hannibal in the open field, but tried to    wear him out by cutting off all small bodies of his troops and by    making it difficult for him to get food for his army. They carried the    war into Spain and finally into Africa, and when, with a weakened    army, Hannibal faced them there, they defeated him. His defeat was the    ruin of Carthage, for the unhappy city was compelled to see her fleet    destroyed, to pay the Romans a huge sum of money, and to give up Spain    to them.      [Illustration: A ROMAN SOLDIER]    OTHER ROMAN TRIUMPHS. The war with Carthage ended two hundred and two    years before the birth of Christ. In the wars that followed, Roman    armies fought not only in Spain and Africa, but also in Greece and    Asia. Carthage was destroyed; as was also Corinth, a Greek city. Roman    generals enriched themselves and sent great treasures back to Rome.    Roman merchants grew rich because their rivals in Carthage and Corinth    were ruined or because the conquered cities were forbidden to trade    with any city but Rome. All this took a long time and many wars, but    in the end the Romans became masters of every land along the shores of    the Mediterranean. This was not wholly a misfortune, for the Romans    had learned that the Greeks were superior to them in some things and    they took the Greeks as their teachers in most of the arts of living.    The ancient world became a sort of partnership, and we call its    civilization Graeco-Roman, that is, both Greek and Roman.    THE ROMANS AS RULERS. The Romans at first treated the lands in Sicily,    Spain, Africa, Greece, and Asia as conquered territories, or    provinces, sending to rule over them officers who were to act both as    governors and judges. With these men went many tax-collectors or    \"publicans.\" The Romans were obliged to leave in most provinces a    large body of soldiers to put down any attempt at rebellion. Often the    officers and the publicans robbed the country instead of ruling it    justly.    EVIL RESULTS OF CONQUEST. During the wars the Romans had lost many of    their simple ways of living. Some had grown rich in the business of    providing for the armies and navies, and they were eager for new wars    in order to make still bigger fortunes. Hannibal's marches up and down    Italy had driven thousands of farmers from their homes, and they had    wandered to Rome for safety and food. When the war was over many of    them did not go back to their homes. Those who did found that they    could no longer get fair prices for their crops because great    quantities of wheat were shipped to Rome from the conquered lands.    Wealthy men bought the little farms and joined them, making great    estates where slaves raised sheep and cattle or tended vineyards and    olive groves. There was not much work for free men in Rome, for slaves    were very cheap. One army of prisoners was sold at about eight cents    apiece. In this way the poor were made idle, while the rich sent    everywhere for new luxuries.      [Illustration: GLADIATORS After carvings on the tomb of    Scaurus]    CRUEL SPORTS. To amuse the idle crowds, office-seekers and victorious    generals provided cruel sports. Savage animals were turned loose to    tear one another to pieces. What was worse, human prisoners were    compelled to fight, armed with swords or spears. These men were called    gladiators, and often were specially trained to fight with one another    or with wild beasts.    SOME THINGS THE ROMANS LEARNED. But the successes of the Romans    brought them other things which were good. They took the buildings of    the Greeks as models and built similar temples and porticoes in Rome,    especially about the old market place or Forum. Their own houses,    which in earlier times were nothing but cabins, they enlarged, and if    they were rich enough, built palaces, adorned with paintings and with    statues. Unfortunately many of these came from the plunder of Greek    cities, for the Romans were great robbers of other peoples. The poorer    Romans continued to live in wretched hovels.    THE THEATER. The Romans learned more about the theaters of the Greeks.    Their plays were either translated into Latin from Greek or retold in    a different manner from the original Greek. The Romans did not succeed    in writing any plays of their own which were as good as the plays of    the Greeks.      [Illustration: RUINS OF THE ROMAN THEATER AT ORANGE, FRANCE]    THE NEW EDUCATION OF THE ROMANS. The Greeks also taught the Romans how    to write poems and histories. The first histories were written in    Greek, but later the Romans learned how to write in Latin prose and    poetry as good as much that had been written by the Greeks. Greek    became the second language of every educated Roman, and thus he could    enjoy the books of the Greeks as well as those written by Romans. The    education of the Roman boy now began with the poems of Homer, and the    young man's education was not thought to be finished until he had    traveled in Greece and the lands along the eastern Mediterranean.

CHAPTER VII      THE ANCIENT WORLD EXTENDED TO THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC    NEW CONQUESTS OF THE ROMANS. The Romans had as yet conquered only    civilized peoples like themselves, with the exception of the tribes in    Spain and southern Gaul. Now the Roman armies were to push northward    over the plains and through the forests of Gaul, across the Rhine into    unknown Germany, and over the Channel into Britain, equally "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#8)"],[1," with exulting courage. He was cold with fear. But it  was the sort of fear which makes a man want to fling himself from a  great height. But, sitting there calmly in the saddle, he saw a strange  thing--the five men raising their dead leader and turning back toward  the direction from which they had come. Not once did they look toward  the form of Andy Lanning. They knew what he could not know, that the  gate of the law had been open to this man as a retreat, but the bullet  which struck down Bill Dozier had closed the gate and thrust him out  from mercy. He was an outlaw, a leper now. Any one who shared his  society from this moment on would fall under the heavy hand of the law.    But as for running him into the ground, they had lost their appetite for  such fighting. They had kept up a long running fight and gained nothing;  but a single shot from the fugitive had produced this result. They  turned now in silence and went back, very much as dogs turn and tuck  their tails between their legs when the wolf, which they have chased  away from the precincts of the ranch house, feels himself once more safe  from the hand of man and whirls with a flash of teeth. The sun gleamed  on the barrel of Andy Lanning's rifle, and these men rode back in  silence, feeling that they had witnessed one of those prodigies which  were becoming fewer and fewer around Martindale--the birth of a  desperado.    Andrew watched them skulking off with the body of Bill Dozier held  upright by a man on either side of the horse. He watched them draw off  across the hills, still with that nervous, almost irresistible impulse  to raise one wild, long cry and spur after them, shooting swift and  straight over the head of the pinto. But he did not move, and now they  dropped out of sight. And then, looking about him, Andrew Lanning felt  how vast were those hills, how wide they stretched, and how small he  stood among them. He was utterly alone. There was nothing but the hills  and a sky growing pale with heat and the patches of olive-gray sagebrush  in the distance.    A great melancholy dropped upon Andy. He felt a childish weakness;  dropping his elbows upon the pommel of the saddle, he buried his face in  his hands. In that moment he needed desperately something to which he  could appeal for comfort.    The weakness passed slowly.    He dismounted and looked his horse over carefully. The pinto had many  good points. He had ample girth of chest at the cinches, where lung  capacity is best measured. He had rather short forelegs, which promised  weight-carrying power and some endurance, and he had a fine pair of  sloping shoulders. But his croup sloped down too much, and he had a  short neck. Andy knew perfectly well that no horse with a short neck can  run fast for any distance. He had chosen the pinto for endurance, and  endurance he undoubtedly had; but he would need a horse which could put  him out of short-shooting distance, and do it quickly.    There were no illusions in the mind of Andrew Lanning about what lay  before him. Uncle Jasper had told him too many tales of his own  experiences on the trail in enemy country.    \"There's three things,\" the old man had often said, \"that a man needs  when he's in trouble: a gun that's smooth as silk, a hoss full of  running, and a friend.\"    For the gun Andy had his Colt in the holster, and he knew it like his  own mind. There were newer models and trickier weapons, but none which  worked so smoothly under the touch of Andy. Thinking of this, he  produced it from the holster with a flick of his fingers. The sight had  been filed away. When he was a boy in short trousers he had learned from  Uncle Jasper the two main articles of a gun fighter's creed--that a  revolver must be fired by pointing, not sighting, and that there must be  nothing about it liable to hang in the holster to delay the draw. The  great idea was to get the gun on your man with lightning speed, and then  fire from the hip with merely a sense of direction to guide the bullet.    He had a gun, therefore, and one necessity was his. Sorely he needed a  horse of quality as few men needed one. And he needed still more a  friend, a haven in time of crisis, an adviser in difficulties. And  though Andy knew that it was death to go among men, he knew also that it  was death to do without these two things.    He believed that there was one chance left to him, and that was to  outdistance the news of the two killings by riding straight north. There  he would stop at the first town, in some manner fill his pockets with  money, and in some manner find both horse and friend.    Andrew Lanning was both simple and credulous; but it must be remembered  that he had led a sheltered life, comparatively speaking; he had been  brought up between a blacksmith shop on the one hand and Uncle Jasper on  the other, and the gaps in his knowledge of men were many and huge. The  prime necessity now was speed to the northward. So Andy flung himself  into the saddle and drove his horse north at the jogging, rocking lope  of the cattle pony.    He was in a shallow basin which luckily pointed in the right direction  for him. The hills sloped down to it from either side in long fingers,  with narrow gullies between, but as Andy passed the first of these  pointing fingers a new thought came to him.    It might be--why not?--that the posse had made only a pretense of  withdrawing at once with the body of the dead man. Perhaps they had only  waited until they were out of sight and had then circled swiftly around,  leaving one man with the body. They might be waiting now at the mouth of  any of these gullies.    No sooner had the thought come to Andy than he whitened. The pinto had  been worked hard that morning and all the night before, but now Andy  sent the spurs home without mercy as he shot up the basin at full speed,  with his revolver drawn, ready for a snap shot and a drop behind the far  side of his horse.    For half an hour he rode in this fashion with his heart beating at his  teeth. And each canyon as he passed was empty, and each had some shrub,  like a crouching man, to startle him and upraise the revolver. At  length, with the pinto wheezing from this new effort, he drew back to an  easier gait. But still he had a companion ceaselessly following like the  shadow of the horse he rode. It was fear, and it would never leave him.          CHAPTER 10      After that forced and early rising, the rest of the house had remained  awake, but Anne Withero was gifted with an exceptionally strong set of  nerves. She had gone back to bed and fallen promptly into a pleasant  sleep. And when she wakened all that happened in the night was filmed  over and had become dreamlike. No one disturbed her rest; but when she  went down to a late breakfast she found Charles Merchant lingering in  the room. He had questioned her closely, and after a moment of thought  she told him exactly what had happened, because she was perfectly aware  that he would not believe a word of it. And she was right. He had sat  opposite her, drumming his fingers without noise on the table, with a  smile now and then which was tinged, she thought, with insolence.    Yet he seemed oddly undisturbed. She had expected some jealous outburst,  some keen questioning of the motives which had made her beg them not to  pursue this man. But Charles Merchant was only interested in what the  fellow had said and done when he talked with her. \"He was just like a  man out of a book,\" said the girl in conclusion, \"and I'll wager that  he's been raised on romances. He had the face for it, you know--and the  wild look!\"    \"A blacksmith--in Martindale--raised on romances?\" Charles had said as  he fingered his throat, which was patched with black and blue.    \"A blacksmith--in Martindale,\" she had repeated slowly. And it brought a  new view of the affair home to her. Now that they knew from Bill Dozier  that the victim in Martindale had been only injured, and not actually  killed, the whole matter became rather a farce. It would be an amusing  tale. But now, as Charles Merchant repeated the words, \"blacksmith\"--  \"Martindale,\" the new idea shocked her, the new idea of Andrew Lanning,  for Charles had told her the name.    The new thought stayed with her when she went back to her room after  breakfast, ostensibly to read, but really to think. Remembering Andrew  Lanning, she got past the white face and the brilliant black eyes; she  felt, looking back, that he had shown a restraint which was something  more than boyish. When he took her in his arms just before he fled he  had not kissed her, though, for that matter, she had been perfectly  ready to let him do it.    That moment kept recurring to her--the beating on the door, the voices  in the hall, the shouts, and the arms of Andrew Lanning around her, and  his tense, desperate face close to hers. It became less dreamlike that  moment. She began to understand that if she lived to be a hundred, she  would never find that memory dimmer.    A half-sad, half-happy smile was touching the corners of her mouth, when  Charles Merchant knocked at her door. She gave herself one moment in  which to banish the queer pain of knowing that she would never see this  wild Andrew again, and then she told Charles to come in.    In fact, he was already opening the door. He was calm of face, but she  guessed an excitement beneath the surface.    \"I've got something to show you,\" he said.    A great thought made her sit up in the chair; but she was afraid just  then to stand up. \"I know. The posse has reached that silly boy and  brought him back. But I don't want to see him again. Handcuffed, and  all that.\"    \"The posse is here, at least,\" said Charles noncommittally. She was  finding something new in him. The fact that he could think and hide his  thoughts from her was indeed very new; for, when she first met him, he  had seemed all surface, all clean young manhood without a"]]]
