He listened a moment,  but all was still round the hut; then he threw the door open as  a score of men with lighted torches came running towards it, and  raised a shout of satisfaction as the light fell upon Beric.    \"Thanks for your aid, my friends!\" he said as they crowded round  him; \"never was a shout more welcome than yours. You were just in  time, as you may see by looking at the roof. We were about to fire  it and make for the trees, though I doubt if one of us would have  reached them.\"    As the men entered the hut and looked at the ragged holes in the  roof and the bodies of nine wolves stretched on the ground, they  saw that they had, indeed, arrived only just in time. Among the  rescuing party was the man to whom the hut belonged, whose joy at  finding his wife and children unhurt was great indeed; and he poured  forth his thanks to Beric and Boduoc when he learned from his wife  that they had voluntarily abandoned the wood, where they could  have been secure in the shelter of a tree, in order to assist her  in defending the hut against the wolves.    \"You must all come with us,\" Beric said; \"the wolves may return  after we have gone. When our hunt is over I will send some men to  help you to repair your roof. Where are the cattle?\"    \"They are safe in a stockade at the next village,\" the man said.  \"We finished it only yesterday, and drove in all the cattle from  the forests, and collected great quantities of wood so that the  women might keep up great bonfires if the wolves tried to break  in.\"    A few minutes later the party started on their return. As they  walked they could sometimes hear the pattering of footsteps on the  falling leaves, but the torches deterred the animals from making  an attack, and after three hours' walking they arrived at Cardun.  The village stood on a knoll rising from swamps, through which a  branch of the Stour wound its way sluggishly. Round the crest of  the knoll ran two steep earthen banks, one rising behind the other,  and in the inclosed space, some eight acres in extent, stood the  village. The contrast between it and the Roman city but two-and-twenty  miles away was striking. No great advance had been made upon the  homes that the people had occupied in Gaul before their emigration.  In the centre stood Parta's abode, distinguished from the rest only  by its superior size. The walls were of mud and stone, the roof  high, so as to let the water run more easily off the rough thatching.  It contained but one central hall surrounded by half a dozen small  apartments.    The huts of the people consisted but of a single room, with a hole  in the roof by which the smoke of the fire in the centre made its  way out. The doorway was generally closed by a wattle secured by a  bar. When this was closed light only found its way into the room  through the chinks of the wattle and the hole in the roof. In  winter, for extra warmth, a skin was hung before the door. Beyond  piles of hides, which served as seats by day and beds at night,  there was no furniture whatever in the rooms, save a few earthen  cooking pots.    Parta's abode, however, was more sumptuously furnished. Across one  end ran a sort of dais of beaten earth, raised a foot above the  rest of the floor. This was thickly strewn with fresh rushes, and  there was a rough table and benches. The walls of the apartment  were hidden by skins, principally those of wolves.    The fireplace was in the centre of the lower part of the hall, and  arranged on a shelf against the wall were cooking pots of iron and  brass; while on a similar shelf on the wall above the dais were  jugs and drinking vessels of gold. Hams of wild boar and swine hung  from the rafters, where too were suspended wild duck and fish, and  other articles of food. Parta's own apartment led from the back  of the dais. That of Beric was next to it, its separate use having  been granted to him on his return from Camalodunum, not without  some scoffing remarks upon his effeminacy in requiring a separate  apartment, instead of sleeping as usual on the dais; while the  followers and attendants stretched themselves on the floor of the  hall.        CHAPTER III: A WOLF HUNT      Shouts of welcome saluted Beric as with his party he crossed the  rough bridge over the stream and descended the slope to the village.  Some fifteen hundred men were gathered here, all armed for the  chase with spears, javelins, and long knives. Their hair fell over  their necks, their faces were, according to the universal custom,  shaved with the exception of the moustache. Many of them were  tattooed--a custom that at one time had been universal, but was  now dying out among the more civilized. Most of them were, save for  the mantle, naked from the waist up, the body being stained a deep  blue with woad--a plant largely cultivated for its dye. This plant,  known as Isatis tinctoria, is still grown in France and Flanders.  It requires rich ground and grows to a height of three or four  feet, bearing yellow flowers. The dye is obtained from the leaves,  which are stripped two or three times in the season. They are  partially dried, and are then pounded or ground, pressed into a  mass with the hands or feet, and piled in a heap, when fermentation  takes place. When this process is completed the paste is cut up,  and when placed in water yields a blue dye. It can also be prepared  by laying it in the water in the first place and allowing it  to ferment there. The water, which becomes a deep blue, is drawn  off and allowed to settle, the dye remaining at the bottom. Fresh  water is then added to the leaves, which are again stirred up and  the operation is repeated.    Passing through the crowd of tribesmen, Beric entered his mother's  abode, walked up to the dais, and saluted her by a deep bow. Parta  was a woman of tall stature and of robust form. Her garment was  fastened at each shoulder by a gold brooch. A belt studded and  clasped by the same metal girded it in at the waist, and it then  fell in loose folds almost to her feet. She had heavy gold bracelets  on her arms.    \"You are late, Beric,\" she said sternly. \"Our tribesmen have been  waiting nigh an hour for you. I only heard at daybreak that Borgon  had gone out to search for you with a party.\"    \"It was well that he did, mother, for Boduoc and I were besieged  in a hut by a pack of wolves, who would shortly have made an end  of us had not rescue arrived.\"    \"What were you doing in the hut?\" she asked. \"You told me you should  leave the Romans' town before sunset and make your way straight  back here.\"    Beric shortly related the circumstances of the fight.    \"It is well that it is no worse,\" she said; \"but Boduoc ought  to have known better than to have allowed you to leave the trees,  where you would at least have been safe from the wolves. What  mattered the life of a woman in comparison to yours, when you know  my hopes and plans for you? But stay not talking. Magartha has some  roasted kid in readiness for you. Eat it quickly, and take a horn  of mead, and be gone. An hour has been wasted already.\"    A few minutes sufficed for Beric to satisfy his hunger. Then he  went out and joined two or three minor chiefs of experience who  had charge of the hunt. The greater portion of the tribesmen had  already started. Almost every man had brought with him one or more  large dogs trained in hunting the wolf and boar, and the woods  beyond the swamp rang with their deep barking. Instructions had  already been given to the men. These proceeded in parties of four,  each group taking its post some fifty yards from the next. Those  who had the farthest to go had started before daybreak, and it was  another two hours before the whole were in position, forming a long  line through the forest upwards of ten miles in length. A horn was  sounded in the centre where the leaders had posted themselves, and  the signal was repeated at points along the line, and then, with  shouts on the part of the men and fierce barkings on that of the  dogs, the whole moved forward. The right of the line rested on the  Stour, the left upon the Orwell; and as they passed along through  the forest the line contracted. At times wild boars made a dash  to break through it. Many of these were slain, till the chiefs  considered that there was a sufficient supply of food, and the rest  were then allowed to pass through.    No wolves were seen until they neared the point where the two  rivers unite, by which time the groups were within a few paces of  each other. Then among the trees in front of them a fierce snarling  and yelping was heard. The dogs, which had hitherto been kept  in hand, were now loosed, and with a shout the men rushed forward  both on the bluffs in the centre and along the low land skirting  the rivers on either side. Soon the wolves came pouring down from  the wooded bluff, and engaged in a furious conflict with the dogs.  As the men ran up, a few of the wolves in their desperation charged  them and endeavoured to break through, but the great majority,  cowed by the clamour and fierce assault, crouched to the earth and  received their death blow unresistingly. Some took to the water,  but coracles had been sent down to the point the evening before,  and they were speedily slain. Altogether some four or five hundred  wolves were killed.    It was now late in the afternoon. Wood was collected and great  fires made, and the boars' flesh was soon roasting over them. At  daybreak they started again, and retracing their steps formed a  fresh line at the point where the last beat had begun, this time  beating in a great semicircle and driving the wolves down on to  the Stour. So for a fortnight the war went on. Only such deer and  boar as were required for food were killed; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#8)"],[1,"fell upon the group. To Clarence, who had dictated the  matter (though the style was the editor's), the paragraph did not come  as a surprise. His only feeling was one of relief that the editor had  served up his material so well. He felt that he had been justified in  leaving the more delicate literary work to that master-hand.    \"That'll be one in the eye,\" said the Zouave Harry. \"'Ere, I'll stick  it up opposite of him when he comes back to dress. Got a pin and a  pencil, some of you?\"    He marked the quarter column heavily, and pinned it up beside the  looking-glass. Then he turned to his companions.    \"'Ow about not waiting, chaps?\" he suggested. \"I shouldn't 'arf wonder,  from the look of him, if he wasn't the 'aughty kind of a feller who'd  cleave you to the bazooka for tuppence with his bloomin' falchion. I'm  goin' to 'urry through with my dressing and wait till to-morrow night  to see how he looks. No risks for Willie!\"    The suggestion seemed thoughtful and good. The Bounding Zouaves, with  one accord, bounded into their clothes and disappeared through the door  just as a long-drawn chord from the invisible orchestra announced the  conclusion of the Grand Duke's turn.    General Vodkakoff strutted into the room, listening complacently to the  applause which was still going on. He had gone well. He felt pleased  with himself.    It was not for a moment that he noticed Clarence.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"the interviewer, eh? You wish to--\"    Clarence began to explain his mission. While he was doing so the Grand  Duke strolled to the basin and began to remove his make-up. He  favoured, when on the stage, a touch of the Raven Gipsy No. 3  grease-paint. It added a picturesque swarthiness to his appearance, and  made him look more like what he felt to be the popular ideal of a  Russian general.    The looking-glass hung just over the basin.    Clarence, watching him in the glass, saw him start as he read the first  paragraph. A dark flush, almost rivalling the Raven Gipsy No. 3, spread  over his face. He trembled with rage.    \"Who put that paper there?\" he roared, turning.    \"With reference, then, to Mr. Hubert Wales's novel,\" said Clarence.    The Grand Duke cursed Mr. Hubert Wales, his novel, and Clarence in one  sentence.    \"You may possibly,\" continued Clarence, sticking to his point like a  good interviewer, \"have read the trenchant, but some say justifiable  remarks of the Rev. Canon Edgar Sheppard, D.D., Sub-Dean of His  Majesty's Chapels Royal, Deputy Clerk of the Closet, and Sub-Almoner to  the King.\"    The Grand Duke swiftly added that eminent cleric to the list.    \"Did you put that paper on this looking-glass?\" he shouted.    \"I did not put that paper on that looking-glass,\" replied Clarence  precisely.    \"Ah,\" said the Grand Duke, \"if you had, I'd have come and wrung your  neck like a chicken, and scattered you to the four corners of this  dressing-room.\"    \"I'm glad I didn't,\" said Clarence.    \"Have you read this paper on the looking-glass?\"    \"I have not read that paper on the looking-glass,\" replied Clarence,  whose chief fault as a conversationalist was that he was perhaps a  shade too Ollendorfian. \"But I know its contents.\"    \"It's a lie!\" roared the Grand Duke. \"An infamous lie! I've a good mind  to have him up for libel. I know very well he got them to put those  paragraphs in, if he didn't write them himself.\"    \"Professional jealousy,\" said Clarence, with a sigh, \"is a very sad  thing.\"    \"I'll professional jealousy him!\"    \"I hear,\" said Clarence casually, \"that he _has_ been going very  well at the Lobelia. A friend of mine who was there last night told me  he took eleven calls.\"    For a moment the Russian General's face swelled apoplectically. Then he  recovered himself with a tremendous effort.    \"Wait!\" he said, with awful calm. \"Wait till to-morrow night! I'll show  him! Went very well, did he? Ha! Took eleven calls, did he? Oh, ha, ha!  And he'll take them to-morrow night, too! Only\"--and here his voice  took on a note of fiendish purpose so terrible that, hardened scout as  he was, Clarence felt his flesh creep--\"only this time they'll be  catcalls!\"    And, with a shout of almost maniac laughter, the jealous artiste flung  himself into a chair, and began to pull off his boots.    Clarence silently withdrew. The hour was very near.          Chapter 7    THE BIRD      The Grand Duke Vodkakoff was not the man to let the grass grow under  his feet. He was no lobster, no flat-fish. He did it now--swift,  secret, deadly--a typical Muscovite. By midnight his staff had their  orders.    Those orders were for the stalls at the Lobelia.    Price of entrance to the gallery and pit was served out at daybreak to  the Eighth and Fifteenth Cossacks of the Don, those fierce,  semi-civilised fighting-machines who know no fear.    Grand Duke Vodkakoff's preparations were ready.           *       *       *       *       *    Few more fortunate events have occurred in the history of English  literature than the quite accidental visit of Mr. Bart Kennedy to the  Lobelia on that historic night. He happened to turn in there casually  after dinner, and was thus enabled to see the whole thing from start to  finish. At a quarter to eleven a wild-eyed man charged in at the main  entrance of Carmelite House, and, too impatient to use the lift, dashed  up the stairs, shouting for pens, ink and paper.    Next morning the _Daily Mail_ was one riot of headlines. The whole  of page five was given up to the topic. The headlines were not elusive.  They flung the facts at the reader:--        SCENE AT THE LOBELIA      PRINCE OTTO OF SAXE-PFENNIG      GIVEN THE BIRD BY      RUSSIAN SOLDIERS      WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME?    There were about seventeen more, and then came Mr. Bart Kennedy's  special report.    He wrote as follows:--    \"A night to remember. A marvellous night. A night such as few will see  again. A night of fear and wonder. The night of September the eleventh.  Last night.    \"Nine-thirty. I had dined. I had eaten my dinner. My dinner! So  inextricably are the prose and romance of life blended. My dinner! I  had eaten my dinner on this night. This wonderful night. This night of  September the eleventh. Last night!    \"I had dined at the club. A chop. A boiled potato. Mushrooms on toast.  A touch of Stilton. Half-a-bottle of Beaune. I lay back in my chair. I  debated within myself. A Hall? A theatre? A book in the library? That  night, the night of September the eleventh, I as near as a toucher  spent in the library of my club with a book. That night! The night of  September the eleventh. Last night!    \"Fate took me to the Lobelia. Fate! We are its toys. Its footballs. We  are the footballs of Fate. Fate might have sent me to the Gaiety. Fate  took me to the Lobelia. This Fate which rules us.    \"I sent in my card to the manager. He let me through. Ever courteous.  He let me through on my face. This manager. This genial and courteous  manager.    \"I was in the Lobelia. A dead-head. I was in the Lobelia as a  dead-head!\"    Here, in the original draft of the article, there are reflections, at  some length, on the interior decorations of the Hall, and an excursus  on music-hall performances in general. It is not till he comes to  examine the audience that Mr. Kennedy returns to the main issue.    \"And what manner of audience was it that had gathered together to view  the entertainment provided by the genial and courteous manager of the  Lobelia? The audience. Beyond whom there is no appeal. The Caesars of  the music-hall. The audience.\"    At this point the author has a few extremely interesting and thoughtful  remarks on the subject of audiences. These may be omitted. \"In the  stalls I noted a solid body of Russian officers. These soldiers from  the Steppes. These bearded men. These Russians. They sat silent and  watchful. They applauded little. The programme left them cold. The  Trick Cyclist. The Dashing Soubrette and Idol of Belgravia. The  Argumentative College Chums. The Swell Comedian. The Man with the  Performing Canaries. None of these could rouse them. They were waiting.  Waiting. Waiting tensely. Every muscle taut. Husbanding their strength.  Waiting. For what?    \"A man at my side told a friend that a fellow had told him that he had  been told by a commissionaire that the pit and gallery were full of  Russians. Russians. Russians everywhere. Why? Were they genuine patrons  of the Halls? Or were they there from some ulterior motive? There was  an air of suspense. We were all waiting. Waiting. For what?    \"The atmosphere is summed up in a word. One word. Sinister. The  atmosphere was sinister.    \"AA! A stir in the crowded house. The ruffling of the face of the sea  before a storm.

These menials carry sheets of  cardboard. But not blank sheets. On each sheet is a number.    \"The number 15.    \"Who is number 15?    \"Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig.
