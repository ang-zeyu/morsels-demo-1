Commencing then with passenger engines for fast traffic, and taking first  in order the Great Western Railway, we find that it holds a unique  position, as its fast broad gauge trains are worked by the same type of  engine as that designed by Sir Daniel Grooch in 1848, although, of course,  the bulk of the stock has been rebuilt, almost on the same lines, and  rendered substantially new engines. They are single engines of 7 ft. gauge  with inside cylinders 18 in. diameter, and 24 in. stroke; the  driving-wheels are 8 ft. in diameter, and there are two pairs of leading  wheels, and one of trailing, all of 4 ft. 6 in. diameter. The total wheel  base is 18 ft. 6 in.; the boiler is 4 ft. 6 in. diameter, and 11 ft. 3 in.  long. The grate area is 21 square feet, and the heating surface is, in the  fire-box, 153 square feet; tubes, 1,800 square feet; total, 1,953 square  feet. The weight in full working order is, on the four leading wheels, 15  ton 18 cwt.; driving wheels, 16 tons; trailing wheels, 9 tons 10 cwt.;  total, 41 tons 8 cwt. The tender, which is low-sided and very graceful in  appearance, weighs 15 tons 10 cwt., and will hold 2,700 gallons of water.    The boiler pressure is 140 lb. on the square inch, and the tractive power  per pound of steam pressure in the cylinders is 81 lb. These engines take  the fast trains to the West of England; the Flying Dutchman averages 170  tons gross load, and runs at a mean time-table speed of 53 miles per hour,  which allowing for starting, stopping, and slowing down to 25 miles per  hour through Didcot gives a speed of nearly 60 miles an hour.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY.]    The average consumption of coal per mile, of thirteen of these engines,  with the express trains between London and Bristol, during the half-year  averaged 24.67 lb. per mile, the lowest being 23.22 lb., and the highest  26.17 lb., the average load being about eight coaches, or 243 tons. We  have already seen that in 1849 the Great Western express ran at a higher  rate than at present, being an exception to the general rule; and the  fastest journey on record was performed at this time by one of these  engines, when on May 14, 1848, the Great Britain took this Bristol  express, consisting of four coaches and a van, to Didcot, fifty-three  miles, in forty-seven minutes, or at the average speed of sixty-eight  miles an hour. The maximum running speed was seventy-five miles an hour,  and the indicated horse-power 1,000. A class of engines corresponding to  this type in their general dimensions, but with 7 ft. coupled wheels, was  introduced on the line, but it was not found successful. Through the  courtesy of Mr. Dean, I am enabled to give a table showing the running  speeds and loads of the principal express trains, broad and narrow gauge,  to the West and North of England, run on the Great Western Railway.    _Great Western Railway.--Average Speed and Weight of Express  Trains._    ------------------+---------------------------+----------------------                    |  Speed to first stopping  |                    |          station.         |   Weight of train.                    +-------+--------+---------+-------+---------+-----                    |       |        | Average |       |         |       Train.       |       |        | speed-- |Engine |Carriages|                    |       |        |miles per|  and  |and vans,|                    |Station|Distance|  hour.  |tender.| empty.  |Total  ------------------+-------+--------+---------+-------+---------+-----                    |       | miles  |         | tons. |  tons.  |    BROAD GAUGE TO WEST OF ENGLAND:  |         |       |         |  9.0 Paddington to |Reading|  36    |   47    |   67  |   149   | 216      Plymouth      |       |        |         |       |         |  11.45     do.     |Swindon| 771/4    |   53    |   67  |   104   | 171                    |       |        |         |       |         |   NARROW GAUGE TO THE NORTH|        |         |       |         |  10.0 Paddington to|Reading|  36    |  39.2   |   60  |   190   | 250       Birkenhead   |       |        |         |       |         |  4.45      do.     |Oxford | 631/2    |  48.8   |   60  |   129   | 189  ------------------+-------+--------+---------+-------+---------+-----    [Illustration: FIG 2.--GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY.]    The narrow gauge trains are worked by two classes of engines. The first is  a single engine with inside cylinders 18 in. diameter, 24 in. stroke. The  driving wheels are 7 ft. diameter, and the leading and trailing wheels 4  ft. The frames are double, giving outside bearings to the leading and  trailing axles, and outside and inside bearings to the driving axle; this  arrangement gives a very steady running engine, and insures, as far as can  possibly be done, safety in case of the fracture of a crank axle. The  frames are 15 inches deep, of BB Staffordshire iron. The wheel base is,  leading to driving wheels, 8 ft. 6 in; driving to trailing wheels, 9 ft.;  total, 17 ft. 6 in. The boiler is of Lowmoor iron, 10 ft. 6 in. long and 4  ft. 2 in. outside diameter. The grate area is 17 square feet, and the  heating surface is, tubes, 1,1451/2 square feet; fire-box 133 square feet;  total, 1,2781/2 square feet. The boiler pressure is 140 lb. on the square  inch, and the tractive power per lb. of mean pressure in cylinders, 92 lb.  The weight in full working order is, engine, leading wheel, 10 tons; ditto  driving wheels, 14 tons; ditto trailing wheels, 9 tons 10 cwt.; tender,  with 40 cwt. coal and 2,600 gals. water, 26 tons 10 cwt.; total, 60 tons.  These engines are extremely simple, but well proportioned, and are a very  handsome type, and their average consumption of coal, working trains  averaging ten coaches, is about 24.87 lb. per mile. The standard coupled  passenger express engine on the narrow gauge has inside cylinders 17 in.  diameter and 24 in. stroke; the coupled wheels are 6 ft. 6 in. diameter,  and the leading wheels 4 ft.; the wheel base is 16 ft. 9 in. The frames  are double, giving outside bearings to the leading axle, and inside  bearings to the coupled wheels. The boiler is 11 ft. long by 4 ft. 2 in.  diameter; the grate area is 16.25 square feet; and the heating surface is,  tubes, 1,216.5 square feet; fire-box, 97.0 square feet; total, 1,313.5  square feet. The boiler pressure is 140 lb., and the tractive power per  lb. of steam pressure in the cylinders, 88 lb. The weight in full working  order is on the leading wheels, 10 tons 5 cwt.; driving wheels, 11 tons;  trailing wheels, 9 tons 15 cwt.; total, 31 tons.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--LONDON & NORTH-WESTERN RAILWAY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--JOY'S VALVE GEAR.]    Turning now to the London and North-Western Railway, we find that between  1862 and 1865 the express trains were worked with a handsome type of  engines, known as the \"Lady of the Lake\" class. They have outside  cylinders 16 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke, with single driving wheels of  7 ft. 6 in. diameter, and leading and trailing wheels 3 ft. 6 in.  diameter, with a total wheel base of 15 ft. 5 in. The frames are single,  with inside bearings to all the wheels. The boiler is 11 ft. long and 4  ft. diameter, and the heating surface is in the tubes, 1,013 feet;  fire-box, 85 ft.; total, 1,098 feet. The tractive power per lb. of steam  pressure in the cylinders is 68 lb. The weight in full working order is on  the leading wheels, 9 tons 8 cwt.; driving wheels, 11 tons 10 cwt.;  trailing wheels, 6 tons 2 cwt.; total, 27 tons. The tender weighs 171/2 tons  in working order. These engines burn about 27 lb. of coal per mile with  trains of the gross weight of 117 tons, which is not at all an economical  duty. About 1872, the weight of the heavier express trains on the  North-Western had so increased, that a new standard type for this service  was designed, and is now the standard passenger engine; it has inside  cylinders 17 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke; the driving and trailing  wheels are coupled, and are 6 ft. 6 in. diameter, and the leading wheels 3  ft. 6 in. The frames of steel are single, with inside bearings to all the  wheels, and the boiler, of steel, is 9 ft. 10 in. long and 4 ft. 2 in.  diameter. The steel used has a tensile strength of 32 to 34 tons per  square inch, all the rivets are put in by hydraulic pressure, and the  magnetic oxide on the surface of the plates where they overlap is washed  off by a little weak sal-ammoniac and water. In testing, steam is first  got up to 30 lb. on the square inch,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#9)"],[1,"199|1468|0.612| 7932|1618| 85.5|186  |1.222| 733|0.092|111  |3.0|23500|22500   3|0.333|11356|2316|0.459|13360|2725|130.4|267  |1.375|2004|0.150|135.5|4.0|37000|35000   4|0.25 |14260|2909|0.374|17737|3618|165.6|330  |1.495|3477|0.196|153.5|4.8|48500|45000   5|0.200|16580|3383|0.320|21209|4326|195.3|384  |1.595|4629|0.213|167  |5.4|58500|52500   6|0.167|18475|3768|0.281|24310|4959|220.5|429  |1.681|5835|0.240|179  |6.0|67000|60000   7|0.143|20038|4087|0.252|27048|5517|243.2|470  |1.758|7040|0.260|190  |6.4|75000|66000   8|0.125|21422|4370|0.229|29518|6021|263.6|506.5|1.828|8096|0.274|     |   |     |   9|0.111|     |    |0.210|     |    |282  |539.6|1.891|    |     |     |   |     |  10|0.100|     |    |0.195|     |    |299  |570.2|1.950|    |     |     |   |     |  _______________________________________________________________________________________    |     |     |    |     |     |    |     |     |     |    |     |     |   |     |   1|  2  |  3  |  4 |  5  |  6  |  7 |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11 |  12 |  13 | 14|  15 |  16  __|_____|_____|____|_____|_____|____|_____|_____|_____|____|_____|_____|___|_____|_____    Column  Heading  1       Tension in Atmospheres.  2       Volume.  3       Work of Compression.

The first advantage is by far the most important one, and is really the  only excuse for water injection in air compressors. We have seen (table  3) that the percentage of work of compression which is converted into  heat and loss when no cooling system is used is as follows:    Compressing to 2 atmospheres loss  9.2 per cent.     \"         \" 3     \"        \"   15.0  \"   \"     \"         \" 4     \"        \"   19.6  \"   \"     \"         \" 5     \"        \"   21.3  \"   \"     \"         \" 6     \"        \"   24.0  \"   \"     \"         \" 7     \"        \"   26.0  \"   \"     \"         \" 8     \"        \"   27.4  \"   \"    We see that in compressing air to five atmospheres, which is the usual  practice, the heat loss is 21.3 per cent., so that if we keep down the  temperature of the air during compression to the isothermal line, we  save this loss. The best practice in America has brought this heat loss  down to 3.6 per cent. (old Ingersoll Injection Air Compressor), while in  Europe the heat loss has been reduced to 1.6 per cent. Steam-driven air  compressors are usually run at a piston speed of about 350 feet per  minute, or from 60-80 revolutions per minute of compressors of average  sizes, say 18\" diameter of cylinder. Sixty revolutions per minute is  equal to 120 strokes, or two strokes per second. An air cylinder 18\" in  diameter filled with free air once every half second, and at each stroke  compressing the air to 60 pounds, and thereby producing 309 degrees of  heat, is thus, by means of water injection, cooled to an extent hardly  possible with mere surface contact. The specific heat of water being  about four times that of air, it readily takes up the heat of  compression.    A properly designed spray system must not be confused with the numerous  devices applied to air cylinders, by means of which water is introduced.  In some cases the water is merely drawn in through the inlet valves. In  others it passes through the center of the piston and rod, coming in  contact with the interior walls of the air cylinder between the packing  rings. Introducing water into the air cylinder in _any other way, except  in the form of a spray, has but little effect in cooling the air during  compression._ On the contrary, it is a most fallacious system, because  it introduces all the disadvantages of water injection without its  isothermal influence. Water, by mere surface contact with air, takes up  but little heat, while the air, having a chance to increase its  temperature, absorbs water through the affinity of air for moisture, and  thus carries over a volume of saturated hot air into the receiver and  pipes, which on cooling, as it always does in transit to the mine,  deposits its moisture and gives trouble through water and freezing. It  is, therefore, of much importance to bear in mind that unless water can  be introduced _during compression_ to such an extent as to _keep down  the temperature of the air in the cylinder_, it had better not be  introduced at all.    If too little water is introduced into an air cylinder during  compression, the result is warm, moist air, and if too much water is  used, it results in a surplus of power required to move a body of water  which renders no useful service. The following table deduced from  Zahner's formula gives the quantity of water which should be injected  per cubic foot of air compressed in order to keep the temperature down  to 104 degrees Fah.      _________________________________________________________________________                   |                 |                  |                   |                 |Weight of water   |Weight of water                   |                 |to be injected at |to be injected at                   |Heat units devel-|68 deg.

(2) Wear of cylinder, piston and other parts, due directly to the fact  that water is a bad lubricant, and as the density of water is greater  than that of oil, the latter floats on the water and has no chance to  lubricate the moving parts.    (3) Wet air arising from insufficient quantity of water and from  inefficient means of ejection.    (4) Mechanical complications connected with the water pump, and the  difficulties in the way of proportioning the volume of water and its  temperature to the volume, temperature and pressure of the air.    (5) Loss of power required to overcome the inertia of the water.    (6) Limitations to the speed of the compressor, because of the liability  to break the cylinder head joint by water confined in the clearance  spaces.    (7) Absorption of air by water.    Before the introduction of condensing air receivers, wet air resulting  in freezing was considered the most serious obstacle to water injection;  but this difficulty no longer exists, as experience has conclusively  demonstrated that a large part of the moisture in compressed air may be  abstracted in the air receiver. Even in the so-called dry compressors a  great deal of moisture is carried over with the compressed air, because  the atmosphere is never free from moisture. This subject will be  referred to more fully when treating of the transmission of compressed  air.    By far the most serious obstacle to water injection, and that which  condemns the wet compressor, is the influence of the injected water upon  the air cylinder and parts. Even when pure water is used, the cylinders  wear to such an extent as to produce leakage and to require reboring.  The limitation to the speed of a compressor is also an important  objection. The claim made by some that the injected water does not fill  the clearance spaces, but is aerated, does not hold good, except with an  inefficient injection system. The writer has increased the speed of an  air compressor (cylinders 12 in. and 12 in. by 18 in., injection air  cylinder) ten revolutions per minute by placing his fingers over the  orifice of the suction pipe of the water pump. The boiler pressure  remained the same, the cut-off was not changed and the air pressure was  uniform, hence this increase of speed arose from the fact that the water  was restricted and the clearance spaces were filled with compressed air,  which served as a cushion or spring.
