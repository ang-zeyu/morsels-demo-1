And as they watched, and prayed, and worked, they saw approaching  from the north and west a veritable host of winged creatures of  more formidable proportions still; and these bore down upon the  fields as though coming to complete the devastation.  But see!  these are of the color that betokens peace; they are the gulls,  white and beautiful, advancing upon the hosts of the black  destroyers.  Falling upon the people's foes, they devoured them  by the thousand, and when filled to repletion, disgorged and  feasted again.  And they did not stop till the crickets were  destroyed.  Again the skeptic will say this was but chance; but  the people accepted that chance as a providential ruling in their  behalf, and reverently did they give thanks.    Today the wanton killing of a gull in Utah is an offense in law;  but stronger than legal proscription, more powerful than fear of  judicial penalties, is the popular sentiment in favor of these  white-winged deliverers.  Every year come these graceful  creatures to spend the springtime in the fields and upon the  lakes of Utah; and right well do they feel their welcome, for  they are habitually so tame and fearless that they may almost be  touched by the hand before they take flight.    By the autumn of 1848, five thousand people had already reached  the valley, and the food problem was a most difficult one.  The  winter was severe; and famine, stark and inexorable, threw its  dread shadow over the people.  There seemed to be an entry in the  book of fate that every possible test of human endurance and  integrity should be applied to this pilgrim band.  Without  distinction as to former station, they went out and dug the roots  of weeds, gathered the tenderest of the coarse grass, thistles,  and wild berries, and thus did they subsist; upon such did they  feast with thanksgiving, until a less scanty harvest relieved  their wants.    It was at this time that the gold fever was at its height, a  consequence of the discovery of the precious metal in California,  in which discovery, indeed, certain members of the disbanded  \"Mormon\" Battalion, working their way eastward, were most  prominent.  Some of the \"Mormon\" settlers, becoming infected with  the malady, hastened westward, but the counsel of the Church  authorities prevailed to keep all but a few at home.  These  people had not left the country of their birth or adoption to  seek gold; nor bright jewels of the mine; nor the wealth of seas;  nor the spoils of war; they sought and believed they had found, a  faith's pure shrine.  But the gold-seekers hastening westward,  and the successful miners returning eastward, halted at the  \"Mormon\" settlements and there replenished their supplies,  leaving their gold to enrich the people of the desert.    But of what use is gold in the wilderness!  In the old legend a  famishing Arab, finding a well filled bag upon the sand was  thrilled with joy at the thought of dates--his bread; and then  was cast into the depths of despair when he realized that he had  found nothing but a bag of costly pearls.  The settlers by the  lake needed horses and wagons, tools, implements of husbandry and  building; and gold was valuable only as it represented a means of  obtaining these.  Gold became so plentiful and was withal so  worthless in the desert colony that men refused to take it for  their labor.  The yellow metal was collected in buckets and  exported to the States in exchange for the goods so much desired.  Merchandise brought in by caravans of \"prairie schooners,\" was  sold as fast as it could be put out; and strict rules were  enforced allowing but a proportionate amount to each purchaser.    Within a few months after the first settlement of Utah, public  schools were established; and one of the early acts of the  provisional government was to grant a charter to the Deseret  University, now known as the University of Utah.    Up to 1849, Utah had no political history.  Settling in a Mexican  province, the contest to determine its future ownership by the  United States then in progress, the people in common with most  pioneer communities established their own form of government.  But in February, 1848, the treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo gave  California to the United States; months passed, however, before  the news of the change reached the west.  Early in 1849, a call  had been issued to \"all the citizens of that portion of Upper  California lying to the east of the Sierra Nevada mountains\" to  meet in convention at Great Salt Lake City; and there a petition  was prepared asking of Congress the rights of self-government;  and pending action, a temporary regime was established, under the  name of the Provisional Government of the State of Deseret.    \"Utah\" was not the choice of the people as the name of their  state; that word served but to recall the degraded tribes who had  contested the settlement of the valleys.  Deseret, a Book of  Mormon name for the honey bee, was more appropriate.  The  petition of the people was denied in part, and, in 1850 was  established the territorial form of government in Utah.  Concerning the period of the provisional government, such men as  Gunnison, Stansbury, and other federal officials on duty in the  west, have recorded their praises of the \"Mormon\" colonists in  official reports.  But with the un-American system of territorial  government came troubles.    At first, many of the territorial officials were appointed from  among the settlers themselves; thus, Brigham Young was the first  governor; but strangers, who knew not the people nor their ways,  filled with prejudice from the false reports they had heard, came  from the east to govern the colonists in the desert.  Of the  federal appointees thus forced upon the people of Utah, many made  for themselves most unenviable records.    Some of them were broken politicians, professional  office-seekers, with no desire but to secure the greatest  possible gain out of their appointment.  With effrontery that  would shock the modesty of a savage, the non-\"Mormon\" party  adopted and flagrantly displayed the carpet-bag as the badge of  their profession.  But not all the officials sent to Utah from  afar were of this type; some of them were honorable and upright  men, and amongst this class the \"Mormon\" people reckon a number  who, while opposed to their religious tenets, were nevertheless  sincere and honest in the opposition they evinced.    In the early part of 1857, the published libels upon the people  received many serious additions, the principal of which was  promulgated in connection with the resignation of Judge Drummond  of the Utah federal court.  In his last letter to the United  States attorney-general, he declared that his life was no longer  safe in Utah, and that he had been compelled to flee from his  bench; but the most serious charge of all was that the people had  destroyed the records of the court, and that they had resented,  with hostile demonstration, his protests; in short, that justice  was dethroned in Utah, and that the people were in a state of  open rebellion.    With mails three months apart, news traveled slowly; but as soon  as word of this infamous charge reached Salt Lake City, the clerk  of the court, Judge Drummond's clerk, sent a letter by express to  the attorney-general, denying under oath the judge's statements,  and attesting the declaration with official seal.  The records,  he declared, had been untouched except by official hands, and  from the time of the court's establishment the files had been  safe and were then in his personal keeping.  But, before the  clerk's communication had reached its destination, so difficult  is it for stately truth to overtake flitting falsehood, the  mischief had been done.  Upon the most prejudiced reports utterly  unfounded in fact, with a carelessness which even his personal  and political friends found no ample means of explaining away,  President Buchanan allowed himself to be persuaded that a  \"Mormon\" rebellion existed, and ordered an army of over two  thousand men to proceed straightway to Utah to subdue the rebels.  Successors to the governor and other territorial officials were  appointed, among whom there was not a single resident of Utah;  and the military force was charged with the duty of installing  the foreign appointees.    With great dispatch and under cover of secrecy, so that the Utah  rebels might be taken by surprise, the army set out on the march.  Before the troops reached the Rocky Mountains, the sworn  statement from the clerk of the supreme court of Utah denying the  charges made by Judge Drummond became public property; and about  the same time men who had come from Utah to New York direct,  published over their own signatures a declaration that all was  peaceful in and about the settlements of Utah.  The public eye  began to twitch, and soon to open wide; the conviction was  growing that someone had blundered.  But to retract would be a  plain confession of error; blunders must be covered up.    Let us leave the soldiers on their westward march, and ascertain  how the news of the projected invasion reached the people of  Utah, and what effect the tidings produced.  Certain \"Mormon\"  business agents, operating in Missouri, heard of the hostile  movement.  At first they were incredulous, but when the overland  mail carrier from the west delivered his pouch and obtained his  receipt, but was refused the bag of Utah mail with the  postmaster's statement that he had been ordered to hold all mail  for Utah, there seemed no room for doubt.

You  could have crawled up on top of the cave, and slashed around there; and  you old dragons were just three muffs in the last act. I'd rather have  had Polly in the play; she's twice the go in her.    \"So would we all have preferred Polly,\" cried Jasper, bursting into a  laugh, \"but she wouldn't act--she directed everything; she was all the  play, in fact.\"    Polly meanwhile was saying to Pickering Dodge, \"No, not to-night; you  must dance with one of the other girls.\"    \"But I don't choose to dance with anybody but you,\" said Pickering,  holding out his hand. \"Come, Polly, you can't refuse; they're forming  the Lancers. Hurry!\"    Polly's feet twitched nervously under her white gown, and she longed  more than ever after the excitement she had passed through, to lose  herself in the witching music, and the mazy dance. She hesitated a bit,  but just then glancing across the room, \"Come,\" she said, \"I want you  to dance with Ray Simmons. You can't refuse,\" using his own words; and  before he was conscious how it was done, he was by Ray's side, and  asking for the pleasure of the dance.    Polly stood quite still and saw them go away and take the last places  in the set, and a sorry little droop fell upon the curves of the  laughing mouth. She was very tired, and the elation that had possessed  her over the success of the evening was fast dropping out, now that  everybody was enjoying themselves in their own way, leaving her alone.  She felt left out in the cold; and though she fought against it, a  faint feeling of regret stole over her for what she had done. She  almost wished she was standing there by the side of Pickering Dodge,  one of the bright group on whom the eyes of the older people were all  turned, as they waited for the first figure to begin.    \"Well, Polly\"--it was Mr. Alstyne who spoke, and he acted as if he had  come to stay by her side--\"you've covered yourself with glory this  evening.\"    \"Have I, sir?\" asked Polly absently, wishing there had been less of the  glory, and a little more fun.    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mr. Alstyne, his keen eyes searching her face.  \"Well, now, Polly, your dragons, although not exactly like any living  ones extant, made me think of some I saw at the Zoo, in London. Do you  want me to tell you how?\"    \"Oh! if you please,\" cried Polly, her color coming back, and beginning  to forget the dance and the dancers.    \"Let us sit down here, then,\" said Mr. Alstyne, drawing her off to two  chairs in a corner, \"and you shall have the tale. No pun, Polly, you  know.\" And he plunged into it at once.    \"Yes, Alstyne has her all right,\" Mr. King was saying at the further  end of the drawing-room to Mrs. Pepper; he spied the whole thing;  \"he'll take care of her, you may depend.\"    And two more people had seen; one was Jasper. Nevertheless his partner,  Alexia Rhys, thought it necessary to enlighten him.    \"Just think, Polly's given up her chance with the best dancer in the  room, and sent Pickering Dodge off with that horrid Ray Simmons.\"    Jasper pretended not to hear. \"This is our figure,\" he said hastily,  and they whirled off, finished it, and were back again.    \"Isn't she a goose?\" as he fanned her, and tried to introduce another  subject.    \"I suppose she best pleases herself,\" said the boy indifferently. \"Why  should any one else interfere in the matter?\"    \"But some one else ought to interfere,\" cried Alexia, with a little  pout, provoked at his indifference; \"that's just the way she does in  school all the time. Oh! I'm vexed at her, I can tell you. She's so  silly--dear me, it's our turn again.\"    By the next interim she had forgotten all about Polly and whether she  was having a nice time or the stupidest one imaginable, for Joel, who  held dancing in great contempt, sauntered up.    \"Aren't you glad now that you didn't find out about the secret?\" cried  Alexia radiantly. \"Oh! you are such a nuisance, Joey,\" she added  frankly.    \"Phooh!\" exclaimed Joel, \"it wasn't worth finding out, that old secret.  But it's as good as girls ever get up,\" he finished with a supercilious  air.    \"It was a perfectly splendid play!\" cried Alexia, \"and much too good  for a lot of boys. Goodness, Joey, I wouldn't celebrate if you four  were coming home from school to our house. I'd have the jollification  the night before you went back.\"    \"I wouldn't go home if 'twas to your house,\" declared Joel with equal  candor. \"I'd run off to sea, first.\"    \"Come, come, you two, stop sparring,\" cried Jasper, holding out his  hand; \"its our turn again, Alexia. Joel, take yourself off.\"    Alexia flashing Joel a bright, making-up smile, dashed off into the  figure.    \"Good-by,\" said Joel with a smile as cheery, for he really liked her  the best of all Polly's girl friends.    After the dance, supper was announced, and everybody marched out to the  supper room; the dancers with their partners following.    \"Will you allow me?\" Mr. Alstyne seeing the movement, got out of his  chair and offered his arm to Polly with a courtly bow.    \"Oh! don't think of me, sir,\" she began, blushing very hard. \"Joel will  look out for me.\"    \"I much prefer waiting upon Miss Polly Pepper to any other lady in the  room,\" said Mr. Alstyne, with another bow, courtlier than the first,  \"since Mrs. Alstyne is provided for. See, Polly, Mr. King is taking her  out. And your mother has her cavalier, in Mr. Cabot; and Mrs. Whitney  has already gone out with Mr. Fairfax. So if you don't accept my  services, I shall be entirely left out in the cold.\" He stood offering  his arm, and Polly, laughing merrily, put her hand within it.    \"It's very good of you, sir,\" she said simply, as they fell into step  and joined the procession.    \"I'm afraid if you had trusted to Joel's tender mercies, you would have  fared hardly,\" said Mr. Alstyne, laughing. \"Look, Polly, over yonder in  the corner.\" They were just passing into the supper room, and now  caught sight of Joel chatting away to a very pretty little creature, in  blue and white, as busily and unconcernedly as if he had done that sort  of thing for years.    \"Why!\" cried Polly quite aghast, \"that can't be Joel. He just hates  girls, you know, Mr. Alstyne, and never goes to parties.\"    \"He seems to be able to endure it all very well to-night,\" said her  companion dryly. \"Shall I get you an ice, Miss Polly?\"    \"Yes, thank you,\" said Polly absently, not being able to take her eyes  from Joel and his friend. At last, by the force of attraction, he  turned and looked at her. But instead of showing self-consciousness,  his round eyes surveyed her coolly, while he went on talking and  laughing with the little blue-and-white thing.    \"Polly, Polly,\" exclaimed Alexia Rhys, hurrying up, while Jasper was  storming the supper table for her, \"do look at Joel Pepper! He actually  brought in a girl to supper!\"    \"I see,\" said Polly, gazing at the two in a fascinated way.    \"On the other hand,\" said Alexia, sending swift, bird-like glances  around the supper room, \"there are Van and Percy moping off by  themselves as if they hadn't a friend in the world. What a pity; they  used to be so lively at parties.\"    Polly wrenched her gaze away from the astonishing sight on which it had  been fixed, and following Alexia's glance, took a keen look over at the  young Whitneys. \"Oh! oh! I must go to them,\" she cried remorsefully.  \"Tell Mr. Alstyne, please, when he comes back, where I am,\" and without  another word she dashed back of some gaily dressed ladies just entering  the supper room, and was out of the door.    \"If I ever did!\" cried Alexia irritably to herself, \"see anything so  queer! Now she thinks she must race after those boys. I wish I'd kept  still. Jasper, she's just as funny as ever,\" as he came up with a plate  of salad, and some oysters. \"Who?\" said the boy; \"is this right,  Alexia?\" offering the plate.    \"Why, Polly,\" said Alexia; \"yes, that's lovely,\" with a comforted  glance at the plate and its contents. \"Oh! she's gone off, Mr.  Alstyne,\" to that gentleman, approaching with Polly's ice. \"You can't  expect her to stay for the goodies,\" beginning to nibble at her own.    \"Where is she?\" cried Mr. Alstyne, laughing, and sweeping the room with  his brown eyes. \"Oh! I see,\" his glance lighting on the Whitney boys'  corner.    \"Yes, she told me to tell you,\" said Alexia, between her mouthfuls of  salad and oyster, \"where she is,\" as he started.    \"Oh, Percy and Van!\" Polly was whispering hurriedly, \"I'm sorry I hurt  your feelings, only it was so very dreadful, you know, to hear you go  on so to each other.\"    \"We didn't mean anything,\" said Percy, pushing one foot back and forth  in an embarrassed way, and looking as if he did not know what to do  with his hands, which confused him more than anything else, as he had  been quite sure of them on all previous occasions.    Van thrust his into his pockets, and seemed on the point of whistling,  but remembering where he was, took his lips speedily out of their  curves, and looked the other way.    Just then Mr. Alstyne came up.    \"Oh!\" cried Polly suddenly, the color rushing over her face. \"Could  you, Mr. Alstyne, give that to some one else? Percy and Van are going  to wait upon me.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mr. Alstyne in a flash, \"nothing easier;\" and he  disappeared as suddenly as he came.    \"Now, boys,\" said Polly, turning back to them and whispering busily, \"I  know you won't ever say such perfectly dreadful things to each other  again. And so I'm going to ask you both to get me something to eat,  will you?\"    \"How do you know we won't?\" cried Percy slowly. He was sorry enough for  the episode in the coach, yet couldn't resist the temptation to show he  was not to be driven.    \"Because I shall then have"]]]
