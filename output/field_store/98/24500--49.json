Even his mother owned that he looked like health  itself, and no member of the Imperial family could be more richly,  carefully and fashionably dressed than her darling. But even in the  humblest garb he would have been a handsome--a splendid youth, and  his mother's pride! When he left home there was still a smack of the  provincial about him; but now every kind of awkwardness had vanished,  and wherever he might go--even in the Capital, he was certain to be one  of the first to attract observation and approval.    And what had he not known in his city experience? The events of half a  century had followed each other with intoxicating rapidity in the course  of the thirty months he had spent there. The greater the excitement, the  greater the pleasure was the watchword of his time; and though he had  rioted and revelled on the shores of the Bosphorus if ever man did,  still the pleasures of feasting and of love, or of racing with his own  victorious horses--all of which he had enjoyed there to the full--were  as child's play compared with the nervous tension to which he had been  strung by the appalling events he had witnessed on all sides. How  petty was the excitement of an Alexandrian horse-race! Whether Timon  or Ptolemy or he himself should win--what did it matter? It was a fine  thing no doubt to carry off the crown in the circus at Byzantium, but  there were other and soul-stirring crises there beyond those which were  bound up with horses or chariots. There a throne was the prize, and  might cost the blood and life of thousands!--What did a man bring home  from the churches in the Nile valley? But if he crossed the threshold of  St. Sophia's in Constantinople he often might have his blood curdled,  or bring home--what matter?--bleeding wounds, or even be carried home--a  corpse.    Three times had he seen the throne change masters. An emperor and an  empress had been stripped of the purple and mutilated before his eyes.    Aye, then and there he had had real and intense excitement to thrill  him to the marrow and quick. As for the rest! Well, yes, he had had more  trivial pleasures too. He had not been received as other Egyptians were:  half-educated philosophers--who called themselves Sages and assumed  a mystic and pompously solemn demeanor, Astrologers, Rhetoricians,  poverty-stricken but witty and venemous satirists, physicians making  a display of the learning of their forefathers, fanatical  theologians--always ready to avail themselves of other weapons than  reason and dogma in their bitter contests over articles of faith,  hermits and recluses--as foul in mind as they were dirty in their  persons, corn-merchants and usurers with whom it was dangerous to  conclude a bargain without witnesses. Orion was none of these. As  the handsome, genial, and original-minded son of the rich and noble  Governor, Mukaukas George, he was welcomed as a sort of ambassador;  whatever the golden youth of the city allowed themselves was permitted  to him. His purse was as well lined as theirs, his health and vigor far  more enduring; and his horses had beaten theirs in three races, though  he drove them himself and did not trust them to paid charioteers. The  \"rich Egyptian,\" the \"New Antinous,\" \"handsome Orion,\" as he was called,  could never be spared from feast or entertainment. He was a welcome  guest at the first houses in the city, and in the palace and the villa  of the Senator Justinus, an old friend of his father, he was as much at  home as a son of the house.    It was under his roof, and the auspices of his kindhearted wife Martina,  that he made acquaintance with the fair Heliodora, the widow of a nephew  of the Senator; and the whole city had been set talking of the tender  intimacy Orion had formed with the beautiful young woman whose rigid  virtue had hitherto been a subject of admiration no less than her fair  hair and the big jewels with which she loved to set off her simple  but costly dress. And many a fair Byzantine had striven for the young  Egyptian's good graces before Heliodora had driven them all out of the  field. Still, she had not yet succeeded in enslaving Orion deeply and  permanently; and when, last evening, he had assured his mother that she  was not mistress of his heart he spoke truly.    His conduct in the Capital had not certainly been exemplary, but he had  never run wild, and had enjoyed the respect not only of his companions  in pleasure, but of grave and venerable men whom he had met in the house  of Justinus, and who sang the praises of his intelligence and eagerness  to learn. As a boy he had been a diligent scholar, and here he let no  opportunity slip. Not least had he cultivated his musical talents in the  Imperial city, and had acquired a rare mastery in singing and playing  the lute.    He would gladly have remained some time longer at the Capital, but at  last the place grew too hot to hold him-mainly on his father's account.  The conviction that George had largely contributed to the disaffection  of Egypt for the Byzantine Empire and had played into the hands of the  irresistible and detested upstart Arabs, had found increasing acceptance  in the highest circles, especially since Cyrus--the deposed and now  deceased Patriarch of Alexandria--had retired to Constantinople. Orion's  capture was in fact already decided on, when the Senator Justinus and  some other friends had hinted a warning which he had acted on just in  time.    His father's line of conduct had placed him in great peril; but he owed  him no grudge for it--indeed, he most deeply approved of it. A thousand  times had he witnessed the contempt heaped on the Egyptians by the  Greeks, and the loathing and hatred of the Orthodox for the Monophysite  creed of his fellow-countrymen.    He had with difficulty controlled his wrath as he had listened again  and again to the abuse and scorn poured out on his country and people by  gentle and simple, laymen and priests, even in his presence; regarding  him no doubt as one of themselves--a Greek in whose eyes everything  \"Barbarian\" was as odious and as contemptible as in their own.    But the blood of his race flowed in the veins of the \"new Antinous\" who  could sing Greek songs so well and with so pure an accent; every insult  to his people was stamped deep in his heart, every sneer at his faith  revived his memory of the day when the Melchites had slain his two  brothers. And these bloody deeds, these innumerable acts of oppression  by which the Greek; had provoked and offended the schismatic Egyptian  and hunted them to death, were now avenged by his father. It lifted up  his heart and made him proud to think of it. He showed his secret soul  to the old man who was as much surprised as delighted at what he found  there; for he had feared that Orion might not be able wholly to escape  the powerful influences of Greek beguilements;--nay, he had often felt  anxious lest his own son might disapprove of his having surrendered to  the Arab conquerors the province entrusted to his rule, and concluded a  peace with them.    The Mukaukas now felt himself as one with Orion, and from time to time  looked tenderly up at him from the draught-board. Neforis was doing her  best to entertain the mother of her son's future bride, and divert her  attention from his strange demeanor. She seemed indeed to be successful,  for Dame Susannah agreed to everything she said; but she betrayed the  fact that she was keeping a sharp watch by suddenly asking: \"Does your  husband's lofty niece not think us worthy of a single word?\"    \"Oh no!\" said Neforis bitterly. \"I only hope she may soon find some  other people to whom she can behave more graciously. You may depend upon  it I will put no obstacle in her way.\"    Then she brought the conversation round to Katharina, and the widow told  her that her brother-in-law, Chrysippus, was now in Memphis with his two  little daughters. They were to go away on the morrow, so the young girl  had been obliged to devote herself to them: \"And so the poor child is  sitting there at this minute,\" she lamented, \"and must keep those two  little chatter-boxes quiet while she is longing to be here instead.\"    Orion quite understood these last words; he asked after the young girl,  and then added gaily:    \"She promised me a collar yesterday for my little white keepsake from  Constantinople. Fie! Mary, you should not tease the poor little beast.\"    \"No, let the dog go,\" added the widow, addressing the governor's little  granddaughter, who was trying to make the recalcitrant dog kiss her  doll. \"But you know, Orion, this tiny creature is really too delicate  for such a big man as you are! You should give him to some pretty young  lady and then he would fulfil his destiny! And Katharina is embroidering  him a collar; I ought not to tell her little secret, but it is to have  gold stars on a blue ground.\"    \"Because Orion is a star,\" cried the little girl. \"So she is working  nothing but Orions.\"    \"But fortunately there is but one star of my name,\" observed he. \"Pray  tell her that Dame Susa.\"    The child clapped her hands. \"He does not choose to have any other star  near him!\" she exclaimed.    The widow broke in: \"Little simpleton! I know people who cannot even  bear to have a likeness traced between themselves and any one else.--But  this you must permit, Orion--you were quite right just now, Neforis; his  mouth and brow might have been taken from his father's face.\"    The remark was quite accurate; and yet it would have been hard to  imagine two men more unlike than the bright youth full "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#8)"],[1,"the neatest hands in the world at carving up a man and removing  devilments from his intestines. Now, sir, I've always fought pretty shy  of surgeons, for I considered that our Maker never intended His  handiwork to be reconstructed like a bankrupt Dago railway. But by that  time I was feeling so almighty wretched that I could have paid a man to  put a bullet through my head. \"There's no other way,\" I said to myself.  \"Either you forget your religion and your miserable cowardice and get  cut up, or it's you for the Golden Shore.\" So I set my teeth and  journeyed to White Springs, and the Brothers had a look at my duodenum.  They saw that the darned thing wouldn't do, so they sidetracked it and  made a noo route for my noo-trition traffic. It was the cunningest  piece of surgery since the Lord took a rib out of the side of our First  Parent. They've got a mighty fine way of charging, too, for they take  five per cent of a man's income, and it's all one to them whether he's  a Meat King or a clerk on twenty dollars a week. I can tell you I took  some trouble to be a very rich man last year.'    All through the meal I sat in a kind of stupor. I was trying to  assimilate the new Blenkiron, and drinking in the comfort of his  heavenly drawl, and I was puzzling my head about Ivery. I had a  ridiculous notion that I had seen him before, but, delve as I might  into my memory, I couldn't place him. He was the incarnation of the  commonplace, a comfortable middle-class sentimentalist, who patronized  pacificism out of vanity, but was very careful not to dip his hands too  far. He was always damping down Blenkiron's volcanic utterances. 'Of  course, as you know, the other side have an argument which I find  rather hard to meet ...' 'I can sympathize with patriotism, and even  with jingoism, in certain moods, but I always come back to this  difficulty.' 'Our opponents are not ill-meaning so much as  ill-judging,'--these were the sort of sentences he kept throwing in.  And he was full of quotations from private conversations he had had  with every sort of person--including members of the Government. I  remember that he expressed great admiration for Mr Balfour.    Of all that talk, I only recalled one thing clearly, and I recalled it  because Blenkiron seemed to collect his wits and try to argue, just as  he had done at the end of his lecture. He was speaking about a story he  had heard from someone, who had heard it from someone else, that  Austria in the last week of July 1914 had accepted Russia's proposal to  hold her hand and negotiate, and that the Kaiser had sent a message to  the Tsar saying he agreed. According to his story this telegram had  been received in Petrograd, and had been re-written, like Bismarck's  Ems telegram, before it reached the Emperor. He expressed his disbelief  in the yarn. 'I reckon if it had been true,' he said, 'we'd have had  the right text out long ago. They'd have kept a copy in Berlin. All the  same I did hear a sort of rumour that some kind of message of that sort  was published in a German paper.'    Mr Ivery looked wise. 'You are right,' he said. 'I happen to know that  it has been published. You will find it in the _Wiener Zeitung_.'    'You don't say?' he said admiringly. 'I wish I could read the old  tombstone language. But if I could they wouldn't let me have the  papers.'    'Oh yes they would.' Mr Ivery laughed pleasantly. 'England has still a  good share of freedom. Any respectable person can get a permit to  import the enemy press. I'm not considered quite respectable, for the  authorities have a narrow definition of patriotism, but happily I have  respectable friends.'    Blenkiron was staying the night, and I took my leave as the clock  struck twelve. They both came into the hall to see me off, and, as I  was helping myself to a drink, and my host was looking for my hat and  stick, I suddenly heard Blenkiron's whisper in my ear. 'London ... the  day after tomorrow,' he said. Then he took a formal farewell. 'Mr  Brand, it's been an honour for me, as an American citizen, to make your  acquaintance, sir. I will consider myself fortunate if we have an early  reunion. I am stopping at Claridge's Ho-tel, and I hope to be  privileged to receive you there.'        CHAPTER THREE    The Reflections of a Cured Dyspeptic    Thirty-five hours later I found myself in my rooms in Westminster. I  thought there might be a message for me there, for I didn't propose to  go and call openly on Blenkiron at Claridge's till I had his  instructions. But there was no message--only a line from Peter, saying  he had hopes of being sent to Switzerland. That made me realize that he  must be pretty badly broken up.    Presently the telephone bell rang. It was Blenkiron who spoke. 'Go down  and have a talk with your brokers about the War Loan. Arrive there  about twelve o'clock and don't go upstairs till you have met a friend.  You'd better have a quick luncheon at your club, and then come to  Traill's bookshop in the Haymarket at two. You can get back to  Biggleswick by the 5.16.'    I did as I was bid, and twenty minutes later, having travelled by  Underground, for I couldn't raise a taxi, I approached the block of  chambers in Leadenhall Street where dwelt the respected firm who  managed my investments. It was still a few minutes before noon, and as  I slowed down a familiar figure came out of the bank next door.    Ivery beamed recognition. 'Up for the day, Mr Brand?' he asked. 'I have  to see my brokers,' I said, 'read the South African papers in my club,  and get back by the 5.16. Any chance of your company?'    'Why, yes--that's my train. _Au revoir_. We meet at the station.' He  bustled off, looking very smart with his neat clothes and a rose in his  button-hole.    I lunched impatiently, and at two was turning over some new books in  Traill's shop with an eye on the street-door behind me. It seemed a  public place for an assignation. I had begun to dip into a big  illustrated book on flower-gardens when an assistant came up. 'The  manager's compliments, sir, and he thinks there are some old works of  travel upstairs that might interest you.' I followed him obediently to  an upper floor lined with every kind of volume and with tables littered  with maps and engravings. 'This way, sir,' he said, and opened a door  in the wall concealed by bogus book-backs. I found myself in a little  study, and Blenkiron sitting in an armchair smoking.    He got up and seized both my hands. 'Why, Dick, this is better than  good noos. I've heard all about your exploits since we parted a year  ago on the wharf at Liverpool. We've both been busy on our own jobs,  and there was no way of keeping you wise about my doings, for after I  thought I was cured I got worse than hell inside, and, as I told you,  had to get the doctor-men to dig into me. After that I was playing a  pretty dark game, and had to get down and out of decent society. But,  holy Mike! I'm a new man. I used to do my work with a sick heart and a  taste in my mouth like a graveyard, and now I can eat and drink what I  like and frolic round like a colt. I wake up every morning whistling  and thank the good God that I'm alive. It was a bad day for Kaiser when  I got on the cars for White Springs.'    'This is a rum place to meet,' I said, 'and you brought me by a  roundabout road.'    He grinned and offered me a cigar.    'There were reasons. It don't do for you and me to advertise our  acquaintance in the street. As for the shop, I've owned it for five  years. I've a taste for good reading, though you wouldn't think it, and  it tickles me to hand it out across the counter ... First, I want to  hear about Biggleswick.'    'There isn't a great deal to it. A lot of ignorance, a large slice of  vanity, and a pinch or two of wrong-headed honesty--these are the  ingredients of the pie. Not much real harm in it. There's one or two  dirty literary gents who should be in a navvies' battalion, but they're  about as dangerous as yellow Kaffir dogs. I've learned a lot and got  all the arguments by heart, but you might plant a Biggleswick in every  shire and it wouldn't help the Boche. I can see where the danger lies  all the same. These fellows talked academic anarchism, but the genuine  article is somewhere about and to find it you've got to look in the big  industrial districts. We had faint echoes of it in Biggleswick. I mean  that the really dangerous fellows are those who want to close up the  war at once and so get on with their blessed class war, which cuts  across nationalities. As for being spies and that sort of thing, the  Biggleswick lads are too callow.'    'Yes,' said Blenkiron reflectively. 'They haven't got as much sense as  God gave to geese. You're sure you didn't hit against any heavier  metal?'    'Yes. There's a man called Launcelot Wake, who came down to speak once.  I had met him before. He has the makings of a fanatic, and he's the  more dangerous because you can see his conscience is uneasy. I can  fancy him bombing a Prime Minister merely to quiet his own doubts.'    'So,' he said. 'Nobody else?'    I reflected. 'There's Mr Ivery, but you know him better than I. I  shouldn't put much on him, but I'm not precisely certain, for I never  had a chance of getting to know him.'    'Ivery,' said Blenkiron in surprise. 'He has a hobby for half-baked  youth, just as another rich man might fancy orchids or fast trotters.  You sure can place him right enough.'    'I dare say. Only I don't know enough to be positive.'    He sucked at his cigar for a minute or so. 'I guess, Dick, if I told  you all I've been doing since I reached these shores you would call me  a romancer. I've been way down among the toilers. I did a spell as  unskilled dilooted labour in the Barrow shipyards. I was barman in a  hotel on the Portsmouth Road, and I put in a black month driving a  taxicab in the city of London. For a while I was the accredited  correspondent"]]]
