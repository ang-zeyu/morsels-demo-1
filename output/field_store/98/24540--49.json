If at last you find  The proven facts against me, take the plunge.  Launch out into that darkness. Let the lamps  Of heaven, the glowing hearth-fires that we knew  Die out behind you, while the freshening wind  Blows on your brows, and overhead you see  The stars of truth that lead you from your home.    I love this island,--every little glen,  Hazel-wood, brook, and fish-pond; every bough  And blossom in that garden; and I hoped  To die here. But it is not chance, I know,  That sends me wandering through the world again.  My use perhaps is ended; and the power  That made me, breaks me.\"                            As he spoke, they saw  The tears upon his face. He bowed his head  And left them silent in the darkened room.  They saw his face no more.                             The self-same hour,  Tycho, Christine, and all their children, left  Their island-home for even In their ship  They took a few of the smaller instruments,  And that most precious record of the stars,  His legacy to the future. Into the night  They vanished, leaving on the ghostly cliffs  Only one dark, distorted, dog-like shape  To watch them, sobbing, under its matted hair,  \"Master, have you forgotten Jeppe, your dwarf?\"          IX      He was a great magician, Tycho Brahe,  And yet his magic, under changing skies,  Could never change his heart, or touch the hills  Of those far countries with the tints of home.  And, after many a month of wandering,  He came to Prague; and, though with open hands  Rodolphe received him, like an exiled king,  A new Aeneas, exiled for the truth  (For so they called him), none could heal the wounds  That bled within, or lull his grief to sleep  With that familiar whisper of the waves,  Ebbing and flowing around Uraniborg.    Doggedly still he laboured; point by point,  Crept on, with aching heart and burning brain,  Until his table of the stars had reached  The thousand that he hoped, to crown his toil.  But Christine heard him murmuring in the night,  \"The work, the work! Not to have lived in vain!  Into whose hands can I entrust it all?  I thought to find him standing by the way,  Waiting to seize the splendour from my hand,  The swift, young-eyed runner with the torch.  Let me not live in vain, let me not fall  Before I yield it to the appointed soul.\"  And yet the Power that made and broke him heard:  For, on a certain day, to Tycho came  Another exile, guided through the dark  Of Europe by the starlight in his eyes,  Or that invisible hand which guides the world.  He asked him, as the runner with the torch  Alone could ask, asked as a natural right  For Tycho's hard-won life-work, those results,  His tables of the stars. He gave his name  Almost as one who told him, _It is I;_  And yet unconscious that he told; a name  Not famous yet, though truth had marked him out  Already, by his exile, as her own,--  The name of Johann Kepler.                             \"It was strange,\"  Wrote Kepler, not long after, \"for I asked  Unheard-of things, and yet he gave them to me  As if I were his son. When first I saw him,  We seemed to have known each other years ago  In some forgotten world. I could not guess  That Tycho Brahe was dying. He was quick  Of temper, and we quarrelled now and then,  Only to find ourselves more closely bound  Than ever. I believe that Tycho died  Simply of heartache for his native land.  For though he always met me with a smile,  Or jest upon his lips, he could not sleep  Or work, and often unawares I caught  Odd little whispered phrases on his lips  As if he talked to himself, in a kind of dream.  Yet I believe the clouds dispersed a little  Around his death-bed, and with that strange joy  Which comes in death, he saw the unchanging stars.  Christine was there. She held him in her arms.  I think, too, that he knew his work was safe.  An hour before he died, he smiled at me,  And whispered,--what he meant I hardly know--  Perhaps a broken echo from the past,  A fragment of some old familiar thought,  And yet I seemed to know. It haunts me still:  _'Come then, swift-footed, let me see you stand,  Waiting before me, crowned with youth and joy;  This is the turning. Take it from my hand.  For I am ready, ready now, to fall.'\"_          III    KEPLER      John Kepler, from the chimney corner, watched  His wife Susannah, with her sleeves rolled back  Making a salad in a big blue bowl.  The thick tufts of his black rebellious hair  Brushed into sleek submission; his trim beard  Snug as the soft round body of a thrush  Between the white wings of his fan-shaped ruff  (His best, with the fine lace border) spoke of guests  Expected; and his quick grey humorous eyes,  His firm red whimsical pleasure-loving mouth,  And all those elvish twinklings of his face,  Were lit with eagerness. Only between his brows,  Perplexed beneath that subtle load of dreams,  Two delicate shadows brooded.                                \"What does it mean?  Sir Henry Wotton's letter breathed a hint  That Italy is prohibiting my book,\"  He muttered. \"Then, if Austria damns it too,  Susannah mine, we may be forced to choose  Between the truth and exile. When he comes,  He'll tell me more. Ambassadors, I suppose,  Can only write in cipher, while our world  Is steered to heaven by murderers and thieves;  But, if he'd wrapped his friendly warnings up  In a verse or two, I might have done more work  These last three days, eh, Sue?\"                                   \"Look, John,\" said she,  \"What beautiful hearts of lettuce! Tell me now  How shall I mix it? Will your English guest  Turn up his nose at dandelion leaves  As crisp and young as these? They've just the tang  Of bitterness in their milk that gives a relish  And makes all sweet; and that's philosophy, John.  Now--these spring onions! Would his Excellency  Like sugared rose-leaves better?\"                                    \"He's a poet,  Not an ambassador only, so I think  He'll like a cottage salad.\"                               \"A poet, John!  I hate their arrogant little insect ways!  I'll put a toadstool in.\"                            \"Poets, dear heart,  Can be divided into two clear kinds,--  One that, by virtue of a half-grown brain,  Lives in a silly world of his own making,  A bubble, blown by himself, in which he flits  And dizzily bombinates, chanting 'I, I, I,'  For there is nothing in the heavens above  Or the earth, or hell beneath, but goes to swell  His personal pronoun. Bring him some dreadful news  His dearest friend is burned to death,--You'll see  The monstrous insect strike an attitude  And shape himself into one capital I,  A rubric, with red eyes. You'll see him use  The coffin for his pedestal, hear him mouth  His 'I, I, I' instructing haggard grief  Concerning his odd ego. Does he chirp  Of love, it's 'I, I, I' Narcissus, love,  Myself, Narcissus, imaged in those eyes;  For all the love-notes that he sounds are made  After the fashion of passionate grasshoppers,  By grating one hind-leg across another.  Nor does he learn to sound that mellower 'You,'  Until his bubble bursts and leaves him drowned,  An insect in a soap-sud.  But there's another kind, whose mind still moves  In vital concord with the soul of things;  So that it thinks in music, and its thoughts  Pulse into natural song. A separate voice,  And yet caught up by the surrounding choirs,  There, in the harmonies of the Universe,  Losing himself, he saves his soul alive.\"  \"John, I'm afraid!\"--                        \"Afraid of what, Susannah?\"--  \"Afraid to put those Ducklings on to roast.  Your friend may miss his road; and, if he's late,  My little part of the music will be spoiled.\"--  \"He won't, Susannah. Bad poets are always late.  Good poets, at times, delay a note or two;  But all the great are punctual as the sun.  What's that? He's early! That's his knock, I think!\"--  \"The Lord have mercy, John, there's nothing ready!  Take him into your study and talk to him,  Talk hard. He's come an hour before his time;  And I've to change my dress. I'll into the kitchen!\"    Then, in a moment, all the cottage rang  With greetings; hand grasped hand; his Excellency  Forgot the careful prologue he'd prepared,  And made an end of mystery. He had brought  A message from his wisdom-loving king  Who, hearing of new menaces to the light  In Europe, urged the illustrious Kepler now  To make his home in England. There, his thought  And speech would both be free.                                 \"My friend,\" said Wotton,  \"I have moved in those old strongholds of the night,  And heard strange mutterings. It is not many years  Since Bruno burned. There's trouble brewing too,  For one you know, I think,--the Florentine  Who made that curious optic tube.\"--                                       \"You mean  The man at Padua, Galileo?\"--                                \"Yes.\"  \"They will not dare or need. Proof or disproof  Rests with their eyes.\"--                            \"Kepler, have you not heard  Of those who, fifteen hundred years ago,  Had eyes and would not see? Eyes quickly close  When souls prefer the dark.\"--  \"So be it. Other and younger eyes will see.  Perhaps that's why God gave the young a spice  Of devilry. They'll go look, while elders gasp;  And, when the Devil and Truth go hand in hand,  God help their enemies. You will send my thanks,  My grateful thanks, Sir Henry, to your king.  To-day I cannot answer you. I must think.  It would be very difficult My wife  Would find it hard to leave her native land.  Say nothing yet before her.\"                               Then, to hide  Their secret from Susannah, Kepler poured  His mind out, and the world's dead branches bloomed.  For, when he talked, another spring began  To which our May was winter; and, in the boughs  Of his delicious thoughts, like feathered choirs,  Bits of old rhyme, scraps from the Sabine farm,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#8)"],[1,"much joy  to, was a regular form for ceasing to care about.    The modern use of the word dates back to Philippides the dispatch-runner.  Bringing the news of Marathon, he found the archons seated, in suspense  regarding the issue of the battle. 'Joy, we win!' he said, and died upon  his message, breathing his last in the word Joy. The earliest letter  beginning with it is that in which Cleon the Athenian demagogue, writing  from Sphacteria, sends the good news of his victory and capture of  Spartans at that place. However, later than that we find Nicias writing  from Sicily and keeping to the older custom of coming to business at once  with no such introduction.    Now the admirable Plato, no bad authority on such matters, would have us  reject the salutation Joy altogether; it is a mean wish, wanting in  seriousness, according to him; his substitute is Prosperity, which stands  for a satisfactory condition both of body and soul; in a letter to  Dionysius, he reproves him for commencing a hymn to Apollo with Joy,  which he maintains is unworthy of the Pythian, and not fit even for men  of any discretion, not to mention Gods.    Pythagoras the mystic has vouchsafed us no writings of his own; but we  may infer from his disciples, Ocellus the Lucanian and Archytas, for  instance, that he headed his letters neither with Joy nor Prosperity, but  recommended beginning with Hail. At any rate all the Pythagoreans in  writing to one another (when their tone is serious, that is) started with  wishing Health, which they took to be the prime need of soul and body  alike, and to include all human blessings. The Pentagram [Footnote: See  _Pythagoras_ in Notes.], that interlaced triple triangle which served them  as a sort of password, they called by the name Health. They argued that  Health included Joy and Prosperity, but that neither of those two was  coextensive with Health. Some of them gave to the Quaternion, [Footnote:  See _Pythagoras_ in Notes.] which is their most solemn oath, and sums  their perfect number, the name of Beginning of Health. Philolaus might be  quoted.    But I need hardly go so far back. Epicurus assuredly rejoiced in joy--  pleasure was the chief Good in his eyes; yet in his most earnest letters  (which are not very numerous), and in those to his most intimate friends,  he starts with Hail. And in tragedy and the old comedy you will  constantly find it used quite at the beginning. You remember,      Hail to thee, joy be thine--    which puts health before rejoicing clearly enough. And says Alexis:      All hail, my lord; after long time thou comest.    Again Achaeus:      I come in sorry plight, yet wish thee health.    And Philemon:      Health first I ask, and next prosperity,    Joy thirdly, and to owe not any man.    As for the writer of the drinking-song mentioned in Plato, what says  he?--'Best is health, and second beauty, and third wealth'; joy he  never so much as names. I need hardly adduce the trite saw:      Chief of them that blessings give,    Health, with thee I mean to live.    But, if Health is chief, her gift, which is the enjoyment of health,  should rank before other Goods.    I could multiply these examples by the thousand from poets, historians,  philosophers, who give Health the place of honour; but you will not  require any such childish pedantry of me, wiping out my original offence  by another; I shall do better to add a historical anecdote or two which  occur to me as relevant.    Eumenes of Cardia, writing to Antipater, states that just before the  battle of Issus, Hephaestion came at dawn into Alexander's tent. Either  in absence of mind and confusion like mine, or else under a divine  impulse, he gave the evening salutation like me--'Hail, sire; 'tis time  we were at our posts.' All present were confounded at the irregularity,  and Hephaestion himself was like to die of shame, when Alexander said, 'I  take the omen; it is a promise that we shall come back safe from battle.'    Antiochus Soter, about to engage the Galatians, dreamed that Alexander  stood over him and told him to give his men the password Health; and with  this word it was that he won that marvellous victory.    Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, in a letter to Seleucus, just reversed the  usual order, bidding him Hail at the beginning, and adding Rejoice at the  end instead of wishing him Health; this is recorded by Dionysodorus, the  collector of his letters.    The case of Pyrrhus the Epirot is well worth mention; as a general he was  only second to Alexander, and he experienced a thousand vicissitudes of  fortune. In all his prayers, sacrifices, and offerings, he never asked  for victory or increase of his royal dignity, for fame or excessive  wealth; his whole prayer was always in one word, Health; as long as he  had that, he thought all else would come of itself. And it was true  wisdom, in my opinion; he remembered that all other good things are  worthless, if health is wanting.    Oh, certainly (says some one); but we have assigned each form to its  proper place by this time; and if you disregard that--even though there  was no bad meaning in what you did say--you cannot fairly claim to have  made no mistake; it is as though one should put a helmet on the shins, or  greaves on the head. My dear sir (I reply), your simile would go on all  fours if there were any season at all which did not require health; but  in point of fact it is needed in the morning and at noonday and at night  --especially by busy rulers like you Romans, to whom physical condition  is so important. And again, the man who gives you Joy is only beginning  auspiciously; it is no more than a prayer; whereas he who bids you Hail  is doing you a practical service in reminding you of the means to health;  his is more than a prayer, it is a precept.    Why, in that book of instructions which you all receive from the Emperor,  is not the first recommendation to take care of your health? Quite  rightly; that is the condition precedent of efficiency. Moreover, if I  know any Latin, you yourselves, in _returning_ a salutation, constantly  use the equivalent of Health.    However, all this does not mean that I have deliberately abandoned  Rejoice and substituted Hail for it. I admit that it was quite  unintentional; I am not so foolish as to innovate like that, and exchange  the regular formulae.    No, I only thank Heaven that my stumble had such very fortunate results,  landing me in a better position than I had designed; may it not be that  Health itself, or Asclepius, inspired me to give you this promise of  health? How else should it have befallen me? In the course of a long life  I have never been guilty of such a confusion before.    Or, if I may not have recourse to the supernatural, it is no wonder that  my extreme desire to be known to you for good should so confuse me as to  work the contrary effect. Possibly, too, one might be robbed of one's  presence of mind by the crowd of military persons pushing for precedence,  or treating the salutation ceremony in their cavalier fashion.    As to yourself, I feel sure that, however others may have referred it to  stupidity, ignorance, or lunacy, you took it as the sign of a modest,  simple, unspoiled, unsophisticated soul. Absolute confidence in such  matters comes dangerously near audacity and impudence. My first wish  would be to make no such blunder; my second that, if I did, the resulting  omen should be good.    There is a story told of the first Augustus. He had given a correct legal  decision, which acquitted a maligned person of a most serious charge. The  latter expressed his gratitude in a loud voice, thus:--'I thank your  majesty for this bad and inequitable verdict.' Augustus's attendants  raged, and were ready to tear the man to pieces. But the Emperor  restrained them; 'Never mind what he said; it is what he meant that  matters.' That was Augustus's view. Well, take my meaning, and it was  good; or take my word, and it was auspicious.    And now that I have got to this point, I have reason to fear that I may  be suspected of having made the slip on purpose, leading up to this  apology. O God of health, only grant me that the quality of my piece may  justify the notion that I wanted no more than a peg whereon to hang an  essay!          HERMOTIMUS, OR THE RIVAL PHILOSOPHIES      _Lycinus. Hermotimus_    _Ly_. Good morning, Hermotimus; I guess by your book and the pace  you are going at that you are on your way to lecture, and a little late.  You were conning over something as you walked, your lips working and  muttering, your hand flung out this way and that as you got a speech into  order in your mind; you were doubtless inventing one of your crooked  questions, or pondering some tricky problem; never a vacant mind, even in  the streets; always on the stretch and in earnest, bent on advancing in  your studies.    _Her_. I admit the impeachment; I was running over the details of  what he said in yesterday's lecture. One must lose no chance, you know;  the Coan doctor [Footnote: Hippocrates] spoke so truly: _ars longa,  vita brevis_. And what be referred to was only physic--a simpler  matter. As to philosophy, not only will you never attain it, however long  you study, unless you are wide awake all the time, contemplating it with  intense eager gaze; the stake is so tremendous, too,--whether you shall  rot miserably with the vulgar herd, or be counted among philosophers and  reach Happiness.    _Ly_. A glorious prize, indeed! however, you cannot be far off it  now, if one may judge by the time you have given to philosophy, and the  extraordinary vigour of your long pursuit. For twenty years now, I should  say, I have watched you perpetually going to your professors, generally  bent over a book taking notes of past lectures, pale with thought and  emaciated in body. I suspect you find no release even in your dreams, you  are so wrapped up in the thing. With all this you must"]]]
