Thus by degrees the intellectual  lustre of the Priestly Order would wane, and the road would then lie  open for a total destruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for  the subversion of our Privileged Classes.          SECTION 10  Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition      The agitation for the Universal Colour Bill continued for three years;  and up to the last moment of that period it seemed as though Anarchy  were destined to triumph.    A whole army of Polygons, who turned out to fight as private soldiers,  was utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles--the  Squares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral.    Worse than all, some of the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal  fury.  Infuriated by political animosity, the wives in many a noble  household wearied their lords with prayers to give up their opposition  to the Colour Bill; and some, finding their entreaties fruitless, fell  on and slaughtered their innocent children and husband, perishing  themselves in the act of carnage.  It is recorded that during that  triennial agitation no less than twenty-three Circles perished in  domestic discord.    Great indeed was the peril.  It seemed as though the Priests had no  choice between submission and extermination; when suddenly the course  of events was completely changed by one of those picturesque incidents  which Statesmen ought never to neglect, often to anticipate, and  sometimes perhaps to originate, because of the absurdly  disproportionate power with which they appeal to the sympathies of the  populace.    It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at  all above four degrees--accidentally dabbling in the colours of some  Tradesman whose shop he had plundered--painted himself, or caused  himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of  a Dodecagon.  Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned  voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection  in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series of  deceptions--aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents too  long to relate, and, on the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity  and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the  bride--he succeeded in consummating the marriage.  The unhappy girl  committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been  subjected.    When the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State the minds  of the Women were violently agitated.  Sympathy with the miserable  victim and anticipations of similar deceptions for themselves, their  sisters, and their daughters, made them now regard the Colour Bill in  an entirely new aspect.  Not a few openly avowed themselves converted  to antagonism; the rest needed only a slight stimulus to make a similar  avowal.  Seizing this favourable opportunity, the Circles hastily  convened an extraordinary Assembly of the States; and besides the usual  guard of Convicts, they secured the attendance of a large number of  reactionary Women.    Amidst an unprecedented concourse, the Chief Circle of those days--by  name Pantocyclus--arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a hundred  and twenty thousand Isosceles.  But he secured silence by declaring  that henceforth the Circles would enter on a policy of Concession;  yielding to the wishes of the majority, they would accept the Colour  Bill.  The uproar being at once converted to applause, he invited  Chromatistes, the leader of the Sedition, into the centre of the hall,  to receive in the name of his followers the submission of the  Hierarchy.  Then followed a speech, a masterpiece of rhetoric, which  occupied nearly a day in the delivery, and to which no summary can do  justice.    With a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they were  now finally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation, it was  desirable that they should take one last view of the perimeter of the  whole subject, its defects as well as its advantages.  Gradually  introduction the mention of the dangers to the Tradesmen, the  Professional Classes and the Gentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs  of the Isosceles by reminding them that, in spite of all these defects,  he was willing to accept the Bill if it was approved by the majority.  But it was manifest that all, except the Isosceles, were moved by his  words and were either neutral or averse to the Bill.    Turning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must not be  neglected, and that, if they intended to accept the Colour Bill, they  ought at least to do so with full view of the consequences.  Many of  them, he said, were on the point of being admitted to the class of the  Regular Triangles; others anticipated for their children a distinction  they could not hope for themselves.  That honourable ambition would not  have to be sacrificed.  With the universal adoption of Colour, all  distinctions would cease; Regularity would be confused with  Irregularity; development would give place to retrogression; the  Workman would in a few generations be degraded to the level of the  Military, or even the Convict Class; political power would be in the  hands of the greatest number, that is to say the Criminal Classes, who  were already more numerous than the Workmen, and would soon out-number  all the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws of  Nature were violated.    A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans, and  Chromatistes, in alarm, attempted to step forward and address them.  But he found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain  silent while the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final  appeal to the Women, exclaiming that, if the Colour Bill passed, no  marriage would henceforth be safe, no woman's honour secure; fraud,  deception, hypocrisy would pervade every household; domestic bliss  would share the fate of the Constitution and pass to speedy perdition.  \"Sooner than this,\" he cried, \"come death.\"    At these words, which were the preconcerted signal for action, the  Isosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes;  the Regular Classes, opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women  who, under direction of the Circles, moved back foremost, invisibly and  unerringly upon the unconscious soldiers; the Artisans, imitating the  example of their betters, also opened their ranks.  Meantime bands of  Convicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.    The battle, or rather carnage, was of short duration.  Under the  skillful generalship of the Circles almost every Woman's charge was  fatal and very many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for a second  slaughter.  But no second blow was needed; the rabble of the Isosceles  did the rest of the business for themselves.  Surprised, leader-less,  attacked in front by invisible foes, and finding egress cut off by the  Convicts behind them, they at once--after their manner--lost all  presence of mind, and raised the cry of \"treachery.\"  This sealed their  fate.  Every Isosceles now saw and felt a foe in every other.  In half  an hour not one of that vast multitude was living; and the fragments of  seven score thousand of the Criminal Class slain by one another's  angles attested the triumph of Order.    The Circles delayed not to push their victory to the uttermost.  The  Working Men they spared but decimated.  The Militia of the Equilaterals  was at once called out, and every Triangle suspected of Irregularity on  reasonable grounds, was destroyed by Court Martial, without the  formality of exact measurement by the Social Board.  The homes of the  Military and Artisan classes were inspected in a course of visitation  extending through upwards of a year; and during that period every town,  village, and hamlet was systematically purged of that excess of the  lower orders which had been brought about by the neglect to pay the  tribute of Criminals to the Schools and University, and by the  violation of other natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland.  Thus  the balance of classes was again restored.    Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished, and  its possession prohibited.  Even the utterance of any word denoting  Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was  punished by a severe penalty.  Only at our University in some of the  very highest and most esoteric classes--which I myself have never been  privileged to attend--it is understood that the sparing use of Colour  is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper  problems of mathematics.  But of this I can only speak from hearsay.    Elsewhere in Flatland, Colour is now non-existent.  The art of making  it is known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time  being; and by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his  Successor.  One manufactory alone produces it; and, lest the secret  should be betrayed, the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones  introduced.  So great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy  looks back to the far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal  Colour Bill.          SECTION 11  Concerning our Priests      It is high time that I should pass from these brief and discursive  notes about things in Flatland to the central event of this book, my  initiation into the mysteries of Space.  THAT is my subject; all that  has gone before is merely preface.    For this reason I must omit many matters of which the explanation would  not, I flatter myself, be without interest for my Readers: as for  example, our method of propelling and stopping"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#8)"],[1,"Harrigan saw that he was being drawn down in a narrowing  circle. Straight before him loomed a black fragment of the wreckage. He  tried to swing to one side, but the current of the water bore him on.  He received a heavy blow on the head and his senses went out like a  snuffed light.    When consciousness returned, there was a sharp pain in both head and  right shoulder, for it was on his shoulder that McTee had fastened his  grip. The captain sprawled on a great timber, clutching it with both  legs and one arm. With the free hand he held Harrigan. All this the  Irishman saw by the haggard moonlight. Then they were pitched high up  on the crest of a wave. As Harrigan grappled the timber with arms and  legs, it turned over and over and then pitched down through empty  space. The wind had literally cut away the top of the wave. He went  down, submerged, and then rose to a giddy height again. As he caught a  great breath of air, he saw that McTee was no longer on the timber.    A shout reached him, the sound being cut off in the middle by the noise  of the wind and waves. He saw McTee a dozen feet away, swimming  furiously. He came almost close enough to touch the timber with his  hands, and then a twist of the wave separated them. Harrigan worked  down the timber until he reached the end of the stanchion which was  nearest Black McTee. All that time the captain was struggling, but  could not draw closer. The wood was drifting before the wind faster  than he could swim.    When he reached the end of the timber, Harrigan wound his long arms  tightly around it and let his legs draw out on the water. McTee, seeing  the purpose of the maneuver, redoubled his efforts. On a wave crest the  storm swept Harrigan still farther away; then they dropped into a  hollow and instantly he felt a mighty grip fall on his ankle. They  pitched up again with the surge of a wave so sharp and sudden that what  with his own weight and the tugging burden of McTee behind him,  Harrigan felt as if his arms would be torn from their sockets. He kept  his hold by a mighty effort, and the tremendous grip of McTee held fast  on his ankle until they dropped once more into a hollow. Then the  captain jerked himself hand over hand up the body of Harrigan until he  reached the timber. They lay panting and exhausted on the stanchion,  embracing it with arms and legs.    Sometimes the wind sent the timber with its human freight lunging  through a towering wave; and several times the force of the storm  caught them and whirled them over and over. When they rose to a wave  crest, they struggled bitterly for life; when they fell into the  trough, they drew long breaths and freshened their holds.    Save once when Harrigan reached out his hand and set it upon that of  Black McTee. The captain met the grip, and by the wild moonlight they  stared into each other's faces. That handshake almost cost them their  lives, for the next moment the full breath of the storm caught them and  wrenched furiously at their bodies. Yet neither of them regretted the  handclasp, for all its cost. If they died now, it would be as brothers.  They had at least escaped from the greatest of all horrors, a lonely  death.    It seemed as if the storm acknowledged the strength of their  determination. It fell away as suddenly as it had risen. A heavy ground  swell still ran, but without the wind to roughen the surface and  sharpen the crests, the big timber rode safely through the sea. The  storm clouds were dropping back in a widening circle beneath the moon  when, as they heaved up on the top of a wave, Harrigan suddenly pointed  straight ahead and shouted hoarsely. On the horizon squatted a black  shadow, darker than any cloud.    All night they watched the shadow grow, and when the morning came and  the tropic dawn stepped suddenly up from the east, the light glinted on  the unmistakable green of verdure.    With the help of the steady wind they drifted slowly closer and closer  to the island. By noon they abandoned the timber and started swimming,  but the submerged beach went out far more gradually than they had  expected. The last hundred yards they walked arm in arm, floundering  through the gentle surf.    Then they stumbled up the beach, reeling with weariness, and sprawled  out in the shade of a palm tree. They were asleep almost before they  struck the sand.    It was late afternoon when they woke, ravenously hungry, their throats  burning with thirst. For food McTee climbed a coconut palm and knocked  down some of the fruit. They split the gourds open on a rock, drank the  liquor, and ate heartily of the meat. That quelled their appetites, but  the sweet liquor only partially appeased their thirst, and they started  to search the island for a spring. First they went to the center of the  place to a small hill, and from the top of this they surveyed their  domain. The island was not more than a thousand yards in width and  three or four miles in length. Nowhere was there any sign of even a  hut.    \"Well?\" queried Harrigan, seeing McTee frown.    \"We can live here,\" explained the captain, \"but God knows how long it  will be before we sight a ship. Our only hope is for some tramp  freighter that's trying to find a short cut through the reefs. Even if  we sight a tramp, how'll we signal her?\"    \"With a fire.\"    \"Aye, if one passes at night. We could stack up wood on the top of this  hill. The island isn't charted. If a skipper saw a light, he might take  a chance and send a boat. But how could we kindle a fire?\"    They went slowly down the hill, their heads bent. At the base, as if  placed in their path to cheer them in this moment of gloom, they found  a spring. It ran a dozen feet and disappeared into a crevice. They  cupped the water in their hands and drank long and deep. When they  stood up again, McTee dropped a hand on Harrigan's shoulder. He said:  \"You've cause enough for hating me.\"    \"Pal,\" said Harrigan, \"you're nine parts devil, but the part of you  that's a man makes up for all the rest.\"    McTee brooded: \"Now we're standing on the rim of the world, and we've  got to be brother to each other. But what if we get off the  island--there's small chance of it, but what if we should? Would we  remember then how we took hands in the trough of the sea?\"    Harrigan raised his hand.    \"So help me God--\" he began.    \"Wait!\" broke in McTee. \"Don't say it. Suppose we get off the island,  and when we reach port find one thing which we both want. What then?\"    Harrigan remembered a word from the Bible.    \"I'll never covet one of your belongin's, McTee, an' I'll never cross  your wishes.\"    \"Your hair is red, Harrigan, and mine is black; your eye is blue and  mine is black. We were made to want the same thing in different ways.  I've never met my mate before. I can stand it here on the rim of the  world--but in the world itself--what then, Harrigan?\"    They stepped apart, and the glance of the black eye crossed that of the  cold blue.    \"Ah-h, McTee, are ye dark inside and out? Is the black av your eye the  same as the soot in your heart?\"    \"Harrigan, you were born to fight and forget; I was born to fight and  remember. Well, I take no oath, but here's my hand. It's better than  the oath of most men.\"    \"A strange fist,\" grinned Harrigan; \"soft in the palm and hard over the  knuckles--like mine.\"    They went down the hill toward the beach, Harrigan singing and McTee  silent, with downward head. On the beach they started for some rocks  which shelved out into the water, for it was possible that they might  find some sort of shellfish on the rocks below the surface of the  water. Before they reached the place, however, McTee stopped and  pointed out across the waves. Some object tossed slowly up and down a  short distance from the beach.    \"From the wreck,\" said McTee. \"I didn't think it would drift quite as  fast as this.\"    They waded out to examine; the water was not over their waists when  they reached it. They found a whole section from the side of the  wheelhouse, the timbers intact.    _On it lay Kate Malone, unconscious._    Manifestly she never could have kept on the big fragment during the  night of the storm had it not been for a piece of stout twine with  which she had tied her left wrist to a projecting bolt. She had wrapped  the cord many times, but despite this it had worn away her skin and  sunk deep in the flesh of her arm. Half her clothes were torn away as  she had been thrown about on the boards. Whether from exhaustion or the  pain of her cut wrist, she had fainted and evidently lain in this  position for several hours; one side of her face was burned pink by the  heat of the sun.    They dragged the float in, and McTee knelt beside the girl and pressed  an ear against her breast.    \"Living!\" he announced. \"Now we're three on the rim of the world.\"    \"Which makes a crowd,\" grinned Harrigan.          CHAPTER 10      They started working eagerly to revive her. While McTee bathed her face  and throat with handfuls of the sea water, Harrigan worked to liberate  her from the twine. It was not easy. The twine was wet, and the knot  held fast. Finally he gnawed it in two with his teeth. McTee, at the  same time, elicited a faint moan. Her wrist was bruised and swollen  rather than dangerously cut. Harrigan stuffed the twine into his hip  pocket; then the two Adams carried their Eve to the shade of a tree and  watched the color come back to her face by slow degrees.    The wind now increased suddenly as it had done on the evening of the  wreck. It rose even as the day darkened, and in a moment it was rushing  through the trees screaming in a constantly rising crescendo. The rain  was coming, and against that tropical squall shelter was necessary.    The two men ran down the beach and returned dragging the ponderous  section of the wheelhouse. They leaned the frame against two trunks at  the same instant that the first big drops of rain"]]]
