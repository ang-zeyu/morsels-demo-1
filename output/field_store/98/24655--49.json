[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#8)"],[1," heard you, and--\"    \"I felt you!\" interrupted Ned, with a short laugh. He told his own  name, but that was all, and seemed about to pass on.    \"Are there any locomotive shops around here?\" asked Mr. Simpson.    \"Locomotive shops?\" queried Ned. \"None that I know of.  Why?\"    \"Well, I heard heavy machinery being used down there;\" and he waved his  hand toward Tom's shops, \"and I thought--\"    \"Oh, you mean Shopton!\" exclaimed Ned. \"That's the Swift plant. No,  they don't make locomotives, though they could if they wanted to, for  they turn out airships, submarines, tunnel diggers, and I don't know  what.\"    \"Do they make munitions there--for the Allies?\" asked Mr. Simpson, and  there was an eager look on his face.    \"No, I don't believe so,\" Ned answered; \"though, in fact, I don't know  enough of the place to be in a position to give you any information  about it,\" he told the man, not deeming it wise to go into particulars.    Perhaps the man felt this, as he did not press for an answer.    The two stood looking at one another for some little time, and then the  man, with a bow that had in it something of insolence, as well as  politeness, turned and went down the path up which Ned had come.    The young bank clerk waited a little while, and then turned his  attention to the tree which seemed to have suddenly assumed an  importance altogether out of proportion to its size.    \"Well, since I'm here I'll have a look up that tree,\" decided Ned.    Favoring his bruised hand, Ned essayed the ascent of the tree more  successfully this time. As he rose up among the branches he found he  could look down directly into the yard with the high fence about it. He  Could see only a portion, good as his vantage point was, and that  portion had in it a few workmen--nothing else.    \"No elephants there,\" said Ned, with a smile, as he remembered Harry's  excitement. \"Still it's just as well for Tom to know that his place can  be looked down on. I'll go and tell him.\"    As Ned descended the tree he caught a glimpse, off to one side among  some bushes, of something moving.    \"I wonder if that's my Simp friend, playing I spy?\" mused Ned. \"Guess  I'd better have a look.\"    He worked his way carefully close to the spot where he had seen the  movement. Proceeding then with more caution, watching each step and  parting the bushes with a careful hand, Ned beheld what he expected.    There was the late occupant of the pine tree the man who had stepped on  Ned's fingers, applying a small telescope to his eye and gazing in the  direction of Tom Swift's home.    The man stood concealed in a screen of bushes with his back toward Ned,  and seemed oblivious to his surroundings.  He moved the glass to and  fro, and seemed eagerly intent on discovering something.    \"Though what he can see of Tom's place from there isn't much,\" mused  Ned. \"I've tried it myself, and I know; you have to be on an elevation  to look down.  Still it shows he's after something, all right. Guess  I'll throw a little scare into him.\"    As yet, Ned believed himself unobserved, and that his presence was not  suspected was proved a moment later when he shouted:    \"Hey! What are you doing there?\"    He had his eye on the partially concealed man, and the latter, as Ned  said afterward, jumped fully two feet in the air, dropping his  telescope as he did so, and turning to face the lad.    \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" he faltered.    \"No one else;\" and Ned grinned. \"Looking for a good place to fish, I  presume?\"    Then, at least for once, the man's suave manner dropped from him as if  it had been a mask. He bared his teeth in a snarl as he answered:    \"Mind your own business!\"    \"Something I'd advise you also to do,\" replied Ned smoothly. \"You can't  see anything from there,\" he went on.  \"Better go back to the tree  and--cut a fishing pole!\"    With this parting shot Ned sauntered down the hill, and swung around to  make his way toward Tom's home. He paid no further attention to the  man, save to determine, by listening, that the fellow was searching  among the bushes for the dropped telescope.    The young inventor was at home, taking a hasty lunch which Mrs. Baggert  had set out for him, the while he poured over some blueprint drawings  that, to Ned's unaccustomed eyes, looked like the mazes of some  intricate puzzle.    \"Well, where have you been keeping yourself, old man?\" asked Tom Swift,  after he had greeted his friend.    \"I might ask the same of you,\" retorted Ned, with a smile.  \"I've been  trying to find you to give you some important information, and I made  up my mind, after what happened to-day, to write it and leave it for  you if I didn't see you.\"    \"What happened to-day?\" asked Tom, and there was a serious look on his  face.    \"You are being spied upon--at least, that part of your works enclosed  in the new fence is,\" replied Ned.    \"You don't mean it!\" Cried Tom. \"This accounts for some of it, then.\"    \"For some of what?\" asked Ned.    \"For some of the actions of that Blakeson. He's been hanging around  here, I understand, asking too many questions about things that I'm  trying to keep secret--even from my best friends,\" and as Tom said this  Ned fancied there was a note of regret in his voice.    \"Yes, you are keeping some things secret, Tom,\" said Ned, determined  \"to take the bull by the horns,\" as it were.    \"I'm sorry, but it has to be,\" went on Tom. \"In a little while--\"    \"Oh, don't think that I'm at all anxious to know things!\" broke in Ned.  \"I was thinking of some one else, Tom--another of your friends.\"    \"Do you mean Mary?\"    Ned nodded.    \"She feels rather keenly your lack of explanations,\" went on the young  bank clerk. \"If you could only give her a hint--\"    \"I'm sorry, but it can't be done,\" and Tom spoke firmly.  \"But you  haven't told me all that happened. You say I am being spied upon.\"    \"Yes,\" and Ned related what had taken place in the tree.    \"Whew!\" whistled Tom. \"That's going some with a vengeance!  I must have  that tree down in a jiffy. I didn't imagine there was a spot where the  yard could be overlooked. But I evidently skipped that tree.  Fortunately it's on land owned by a concern with which I have some  connection, and I can have it chopped down without any trouble. Much  obliged to you, Ned. I shan't forget this in a hurry. I'll go right  away and--\"    Tom's further remark was interrupted by the hurried entrance of  Eradicate Sampson. The old man was smiling in pleased anticipation,  evidently, at the same time, trying hard not to give way to too much  emotion.    \"I's done it, Massa Tom!\" he cried exultingly.    \"Done what?\" asked the young inventor. \"I hope you and Koku haven't had  another row.\"    \"No, sah! I don't want nuffin t' do wif dat ornery, low-down white  trash! But I's gone an' done whut I said I'd do!\"    \"What's that, Rad? Come on, tell us! Don't keep us in suspense.\"    \"I's done some deteckertiff wuk, lest laik I said I'd do, an' I's  cotched him! By golly, Massa Tom! I's cotched him black-handed, as it  says!\"    \"Caught him? Whom have you caught, Rad?\" cried Tom. \"Do you suppose he  means he's caught the man you saw up the tree, Ned? The man you think  is a German spy?\"    \"It couldn't be. I left him only a little while ago hunting for his  telescope.\"    \"Then whom have you caught, Rad?\" cried Tom. \"Come on, I'll give you  credit for it. Tell us!\"    \"I's cotched dat Dutch Sauerkrauter, dat's who I's cotched, Massa Tom!  By golly, I's cotched him!\"    \"But who, Rad? Who is he?\"    \"I don't know his name, Massa Tom, but he's a Sauerkrauter, all right.  Dat's whut he eats for lunch, an' dat's why I calls him dat. I's  cotched him, an' he's locked up in de stable wif mah mule Boomerang.  An' ef he tries t' git out Boomerang'll jest natchully kick him into  little pieces--dat's whut Boomerang will do, by golly!\"          Chapter IX    A Night Test      \"Come on, Ned,\" said Tom, after a moment or two of silent contemplation  of Eradicate. \"I don't know what this cheerful camouflager of mine is  talking about, but we'll have to go to see, I suppose. You say you have  shut some one up in Boomerang's stable, Rad?\"    \"Yes, sah, Massa Tom, dat's whut I's gone an done.\"    \"And you say he's a German?\"    \"I don't know as to dat, Massa Tom, but he suah done eat sauerkraut  'mostest ebery meal. Dat's whut I call him--a Sauerkrauter! An' he suah  was spyin'.\"    \"How do you know that, Rad?\"    \"'Cause he done went from his own shop on annuder man's ticket into de  secret shop, dat's whut he went an' done!\"    \"Do you mean to tell me, Rad,\" went on Tom, \"that one of the workmen  from another shop entered Number Thirteen on the pass issued in the  name of one of the men regularly employed in my new shop?\"    \"Dat's whut he done, Massa Tom.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"'Cause I detected him doin' it. Yo'-all done made me a deteckertiff,  an' I detected.\"    \"Go on, Rad.\"    \"Well, sah, Massa Tom, I seen dish yeah Dutchman git a ticket-pass  offen one ob de reg'lar men. Den he went in de unlucky place an' stayed  fo' a long time. When he come out I jest natchully nabbed him, dat's  whut I done, an' I took him to Boomerang's stable.\"    \"How'd you get him to go with you?\" asked Ned, for the old colored man  was feeble, and most of the men employed at Tom's plant were of a  robust type.    \"I done fooled him. I said as how I'd jest brought from town in mah  mule cart some new sauerkraut, an' he could sample it if he liked. So  he went wif me, an' when I got him to de stable I pushed him in and  locked de door!\"    \"Come on!\" cried Tom to his chum. \"Rad may be right, after all, and one  of my workmen may be a German spy, though I've tried to weed them all  out.    \"However, no matter about that, if he was employed in another shop, he  had no right to go into Number Thirteen.  That's a violation of rules.  But if he's in Rad's ramshackle stable he can easily get out.\"    \"No, sah, dat's whut he can't do!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#8)"],[1,"o.\"    \"Can't I dance till morning, if I want to?\" asked Scraps.    \"You must keep quiet,\" said the cat, in a soft voice.    \"I don't want to,\" replied the Patchwork Girl, speaking as loudly as  usual. \"What right have you to order me around? If I want to talk, or  yell, or whistle--\"    Before she could say anything more an unseen hand seized her firmly and  threw her out of the door, which closed behind her with a sharp slam.  She found herself bumping and rolling in the road and when she got up  and tried to open the door of the house again she found it locked.    \"What has happened to Scraps?\" asked Ojo.    \"Never mind. Let's go to sleep, or something will happen to us,\"  answered the Glass Cat.    So Ojo snuggled down in his bed and fell asleep, and he was so tired  that he never wakened until broad daylight.          Chapter Seven    The Troublesome Phonograph      When the boy opened his eyes next morning he looked carefully around  the room. These small Munchkin houses seldom had more than one room in  them. That in which Ojo now found himself had three beds, set all in a  row on one side of it. The Glass Cat lay asleep on one bed, Ojo was in  the second, and the third was neatly made up and smoothed for the day.  On the other side of the room was a round table on which breakfast was  already placed, smoking hot. Only one chair was drawn up to the table,  where a place was set for one person. No one seemed to be in the room  except the boy and Bungle.    Ojo got up and put on his shoes. Finding a toilet stand at the head of  his bed he washed his face and hands and brushed his hair. Then he went  to the table and said:    \"I wonder if this is my breakfast?\"    \"Eat it!\" commanded a Voice at his side, so near that Ojo jumped. But  no person could he see.    He was hungry, and the breakfast looked good; so he sat down and ate  all he wanted. Then, rising, he took his hat and wakened the Glass Cat.    \"Come on, Bungle,\" said he; \"we must go.\"    He cast another glance about the room and, speaking to the air, he  said: \"Whoever lives here has been kind to me, and I'm much obliged.\"    There was no answer, so he took his basket and went out the door, the  cat following him. In the middle of the path sat the Patchwork Girl,  playing with pebbles she had picked up.    \"Oh, there you are!\" she exclaimed cheerfully. \"I thought you were  never coming out. It has been daylight a long time.\"    \"What did you do all night?\" asked the boy.    \"Sat here and watched the stars and the moon,\" she replied. \"They're  interesting. I never saw them before, you know.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Ojo.    \"You were crazy to act so badly and get thrown outdoors,\" remarked  Bungle, as they renewed their journey.    \"That's all right,\" said Scraps. \"If I hadn't been thrown out I  wouldn't have seen the stars, nor the big gray wolf.\"    \"What wolf?\" inquired Ojo.    \"The one that came to the door of the house three times during the  night.\"    \"I don't see why that should be,\" said the boy, thoughtfully; \"there  was plenty to eat in that house, for I had a fine breakfast, and I  slept in a nice bed.\"    \"Don't you feel tired?\" asked the Patchwork Girl, noticing that the boy  yawned.    \"Why, yes; I'm as tired as I was last night; and yet I slept very well.\"    \"And aren't you hungry?\"    \"It's strange,\" replied Ojo. \"I had a good breakfast, and yet I think  I'll now eat some of my crackers and cheese.\"    Scraps danced up and down the path. Then she sang:        \"Kizzle-kazzle-kore;      The wolf is at the door,      There's nothing to eat but a bone without meat,      And a bill from the grocery store.\"      \"What does that mean?\" asked Ojo.    \"Don't ask me,\" replied Scraps. \"I say what comes into my head, but of  course I know nothing of a grocery store or bones without meat or--very  much else.\"    \"No,\" said the cat; \"she's stark, staring, raving crazy, and her brains  can't be pink, for they don't work properly.\"    \"Bother the brains!\" cried Scraps. \"Who cares for 'em, anyhow? Have you  noticed how beautiful my patches are in this sunlight?\"    Just then they heard a sound as of footsteps pattering along the path  behind them and all three turned to see what was coming. To their  astonishment they beheld a small round table running as fast as its  four spindle legs could carry it, and to the top was screwed fast a  phonograph with a big gold horn.    \"Hold on!\" shouted the phonograph. \"Wait for me!\"    \"Goodness me; it's that music thing which the Crooked Magician  scattered the Powder of Life over,\" said Ojo.    \"So it is,\" returned Bungle, in a grumpy tone of voice; and then, as  the phonograph overtook them, the Glass Cat added sternly: \"What are  you doing here, anyhow?\"    \"I've run away,\" said the music thing. \"After you left, old Dr. Pipt  and I had a dreadful quarrel and he threatened to smash me to pieces if  I didn't keep quiet. Of course I wouldn't do that, because a  talking-machine is supposed to talk and make a noise--and sometimes  music. So I slipped out of the house while the Magician was stirring  his four kettles and I've been running after you all night. Now that  I've found such pleasant company, I can talk and play tunes all I want  to.\"    Ojo was greatly annoyed by this unwelcome addition to their party. At  first he did not know what to say to the newcomer, but a little thought  decided him not to make friends.    \"We are traveling on important business,\" he declared, \"and you'll  excuse me if I say we can't be bothered.\"    \"How very impolite!\" exclaimed the phonograph.    \"I'm sorry; but it's true,\" said the boy. \"You'll have to go somewhere  else.\"    \"This is very unkind treatment, I must say,\" whined the phonograph, in  an injured tone. \"Everyone seems to hate me, and yet I was intended to  amuse people.\"    \"It isn't you we hate, especially,\" observed the Glass Cat; \"it's your  dreadful music. When I lived in the same room with you I was much  annoyed by your squeaky horn. It growls and grumbles and clicks and  scratches so it spoils the music, and your machinery rumbles so that  the racket drowns every tune you attempt.\"    \"That isn't my fault; it's the fault of my records. I must admit that I  haven't a clear record,\" answered the machine.    \"Just the same, you'll have to go away,\" said Ojo.    \"Wait a minute,\" cried Scraps. \"This music thing interests me. I  remember to have heard music when I first came to life, and I would  like to hear it again. What is your name, my poor abused phonograph?\"    \"Victor Columbia Edison,\" it answered.    \"Well, I shall call you 'Vic' for short,\" said the Patchwork Girl. \"Go  ahead and play something.\"    \"It'll drive you crazy,\" warned the cat.    \"I'm crazy now, according to your statement. Loosen up and reel out the  music, Vic.\"    \"The only record I have with me,\" explained the phonograph, \"is one the  Magician attached just before we had our quarrel. It's a highly  classical composition.\"    \"A what?\" inquired Scraps.    \"It is classical music, and is considered the best and most puzzling  ever manufactured. You're supposed to like it, whether you do or not,  and if you don't, the proper thing is to look as if you did.  Understand?\"    \"Not in the least,\" said Scraps.    \"Then, listen!\"    At once the machine began to play and in a few minutes Ojo put his  hands to his ears to shut out the sounds and the cat snarled and Scraps  began to laugh.    \"Cut it out, Vic,\" she said. \"That's enough.\"    But the phonograph continued playing the dreary tune, so Ojo seized the  crank, jerked it free and threw it into the road. However, the moment  the crank struck the ground it bounded back to the machine again and  began winding it up. And still the music played.    \"Let's run!\" cried Scraps, and they all started and ran down the path  as fast as they could go. But the phonograph was right behind them and  could run and play at the same time. It called out, reproachfully:    \"What's the matter? Don't you love classical music?\"    \"No, Vic,\" said Scraps, halting. \"We will passical the classical and  preserve what joy we have left. I haven't any nerves, thank goodness,  but your music makes my cotton shrink.\"    \"Then turn over my record. There's a rag-time tune on the other side,\"  said the machine.    \"What's rag-time?\"    \"The opposite of classical.\"    \"All right,\" said Scraps, and turned over the record.    The phonograph now began to play a jerky jumble of sounds which proved  so bewildering that after a moment Scraps stuffed her patchwork apron  into the gold horn and cried: \"Stop--stop! That's the other extreme.  It's extremely bad!\"    Muffled as it was, the phonograph played on.    \"If you don't shut off that music I'll smash your record,\" threatened  Ojo.    The music stopped, at that, and the machine turned its horn from one to  another and said with great indignation: \"What's the matter now? Is it  possible you can't appreciate rag-time?\"    \"Scraps ought to, being rags herself,\" said the cat; \"but I simply  can't stand it; it makes my whiskers curl.\"    \"It is, indeed, dreadful!\" exclaimed Ojo, with a shudder.    \"It's enough to drive a crazy lady mad,\" murmured the Patchwork Girl.  \"I'll tell you what, Vic,\" she added as she smoothed out her apron and  put it on again, \"for some reason or other you've missed your guess.  You're not a concert; you're a nuisance.\"    \"Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast,\" asserted the  phonograph sadly.    \"Then we're not savages. I advise you to go home and beg the Magician's  pardon.\"    \"Never! He'd smash me.\"    \"That's what we shall do, if you stay here,\" Ojo declared.    \"Run along, Vic, and bother some one else,\" advised Scraps. \"Find some  one who is real wicked, and stay with him till he repents. In that way  you can do some good in the world.\"    The music thing turned silently away and trotted down a side path,  toward a distant Munchkin village.    \"Is that the way we go?\" asked Bungle anxiously."]]]
