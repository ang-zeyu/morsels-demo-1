[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#8)"],[1,"  \"It seems like yesterday, don't it, John?\" said Mrs. Sedley to her  husband; and that night in a conversation which took place in a front  room in the second floor, in a sort of tent, hung round with chintz of  a rich and fantastic India pattern, and double with calico of a tender  rose-colour; in the interior of which species of marquee was a  featherbed, on which were two pillows, on which were two round red  faces, one in a laced nightcap, and one in a simple cotton one, ending  in a tassel--in a CURTAIN LECTURE, I say, Mrs. Sedley took her husband  to task for his cruel conduct to poor Joe.    \"It was quite wicked of you, Mr. Sedley,\" said she, \"to torment the  poor boy so.\"    \"My dear,\" said the cotton-tassel in defence of his conduct, \"Jos is a  great deal vainer than you ever were in your life, and that's saying a  good deal.  Though, some thirty years ago, in the year seventeen  hundred and eighty--what was it?--perhaps you had a right to be vain--I  don't say no.  But I've no patience with Jos and his dandified modesty.  It is out-Josephing Joseph, my dear, and all the while the boy is only  thinking of himself, and what a fine fellow he is.  I doubt, Ma'am, we  shall have some trouble with him yet.  Here is Emmy's little friend  making love to him as hard as she can; that's quite clear; and if she  does not catch him some other will. That man is destined to be a prey  to woman, as I am to go on 'Change every day.  It's a mercy he did not  bring us over a black daughter-in-law, my dear.  But, mark my words,  the first woman who fishes for him, hooks him.\"    \"She shall go off to-morrow, the little artful creature,\" said Mrs.  Sedley, with great energy.    \"Why not she as well as another, Mrs. Sedley? The girl's a white face  at any rate.  I don't care who marries him.  Let Joe please himself.\"    And presently the voices of the two speakers were hushed, or were  replaced by the gentle but unromantic music of the nose; and save when  the church bells tolled the hour and the watchman called it, all was  silent at the house of John Sedley, Esquire, of Russell Square, and the  Stock Exchange.    When morning came, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley no longer thought of  executing her threats with regard to Miss Sharp; for though nothing is  more keen, nor more common, nor more justifiable, than maternal  jealousy, yet she could not bring herself to suppose that the little,  humble, grateful, gentle governess would dare to look up to such a  magnificent personage as the Collector of Boggley Wollah. The petition,  too, for an extension of the young lady's leave of absence had already  been despatched, and it would be difficult to find a pretext for  abruptly dismissing her.    And as if all things conspired in favour of the gentle Rebecca, the  very elements (although she was not inclined at first to acknowledge  their action in her behalf) interposed to aid her.  For on the evening  appointed for the Vauxhall party, George Osborne having come to dinner,  and the elders of the house having departed, according to invitation,  to dine with Alderman Balls at Highbury Barn, there came on such a  thunder-storm as only happens on Vauxhall nights, and as obliged the  young people, perforce, to remain at home.  Mr. Osborne did not seem in  the least disappointed at this occurrence. He and Joseph Sedley drank a  fitting quantity of port-wine, tete-a-tete, in the dining-room, during  the drinking of which Sedley told a number of his best Indian stories;  for he was extremely talkative in man's society; and afterwards Miss  Amelia Sedley did the honours of the drawing-room; and these four young  persons passed such a comfortable evening together, that they declared  they were rather glad of the thunder-storm than otherwise, which had  caused them to put off their visit to Vauxhall.    Osborne was Sedley's godson, and had been one of the family any time  these three-and-twenty years.  At six weeks old, he had received from  John Sedley a present of a silver cup; at six months old, a coral with  gold whistle and bells; from his youth upwards he was \"tipped\"  regularly by the old gentleman at Christmas: and on going back to  school, he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by Joseph Sedley,  when the latter was a big, swaggering hobbadyhoy, and George an  impudent urchin of ten years old.  In a word, George was as familiar  with the family as such daily acts of kindness and intercourse could  make him.    \"Do you remember, Sedley, what a fury you were in, when I cut off the  tassels of your Hessian boots, and how Miss--hem!--how Amelia rescued  me from a beating, by falling down on her knees and crying out to her  brother Jos, not to beat little George?\"    Jos remembered this remarkable circumstance perfectly well, but vowed  that he had totally forgotten it.    \"Well, do you remember coming down in a gig to Dr. Swishtail's to see  me, before you went to India, and giving me half a guinea and a pat on  the head? I always had an idea that you were at least seven feet high,  and was quite astonished at your return from India to find you no  taller than myself.\"    \"How good of Mr. Sedley to go to your school and give you the money!\"  exclaimed Rebecca, in accents of extreme delight.    \"Yes, and after I had cut the tassels of his boots too. Boys never  forget those tips at school, nor the givers.\"    \"I delight in Hessian boots,\" said Rebecca.  Jos Sedley, who admired  his own legs prodigiously, and always wore this ornamental chaussure,  was extremely pleased at this remark, though he drew his legs under his  chair as it was made.    \"Miss Sharp!\" said George Osborne, \"you who are so clever an artist,  you must make a grand historical picture of the scene of the boots.  Sedley shall be represented in buckskins, and holding one of the  injured boots in one hand; by the other he shall have hold of my  shirt-frill.  Amelia shall be kneeling near him, with her little hands  up; and the picture shall have a grand allegorical title, as the  frontispieces have in the Medulla and the spelling-book.\"    \"I shan't have time to do it here,\" said Rebecca.  \"I'll do it  when--when I'm gone.\" And she dropped her voice, and looked so sad and  piteous, that everybody felt how cruel her lot was, and how sorry they  would be to part with her.    \"O that you could stay longer, dear Rebecca,\" said Amelia.    \"Why?\" answered the other, still more sadly.  \"That I may be only the  more unhap--unwilling to lose you?\" And she turned away her head.  Amelia began to give way to that natural infirmity of tears which, we  have said, was one of the defects of this silly little thing.  George  Osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity; and  Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest,  as he cast his eyes down towards his favourite Hessian boots.    \"Let us have some music, Miss Sedley--Amelia,\" said George, who felt at  that moment an extraordinary, almost irresistible impulse to seize the  above-mentioned young woman in his arms, and to kiss her in the face of  the company; and she looked at him for a moment, and if I should say  that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time,  I should perhaps be telling an untruth, for the fact is that these two  young people had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose,  and their banns had, as it were, been read in their respective families  any time these ten years.  They went off to the piano, which was  situated, as pianos usually are, in the back drawing-room; and as it  was rather dark, Miss Amelia, in the most unaffected way in the world,  put her hand into Mr. Osborne's, who, of course, could see the way  among the chairs and ottomans a great deal better than she could.  But  this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley tete-a-tete with Rebecca, at  the drawing-room table, where the latter was occupied in knitting a  green silk purse.    \"There is no need to ask family secrets,\" said Miss Sharp.  \"Those two  have told theirs.\"    \"As soon as he gets his company,\" said Joseph, \"I believe the affair is  settled.  George Osborne is a capital fellow.\"    \"And your sister the dearest creature in the world,\" said Rebecca.  \"Happy the man who wins her!\" With this, Miss Sharp gave a great sigh.    When two unmarried persons get together, and talk upon such delicate  subjects as the present, a great deal of confidence and intimacy is  presently established between them.  There is no need of giving a  special report of the conversation which now took place between Mr.  Sedley and the young lady; for the conversation, as may be judged from  the foregoing specimen, was not especially witty or eloquent; it seldom  is in private societies, or anywhere except in very high-flown and  ingenious novels. As there was music in the next room, the talk was  carried on, of course, in a low and becoming tone, though, for the  matter of that, the couple in the next apartment would not have been  disturbed had the talking been ever so loud, so occupied were they with  their own pursuits.    Almost for the first time in his life, Mr. Sedley found himself  talking, without the least timidity or hesitation, to a person of the  other sex.  Miss Rebecca asked him a great number of questions about  India, which gave him an opportunity of narrating many interesting  anecdotes about that country and himself.  He described the balls at  Government House, and the manner in which they kept themselves cool in  the hot weather, with punkahs, tatties, and other contrivances; and he  was very witty regarding the number of Scotchmen whom Lord Minto, the  Governor-General, patronised; and then he described a tiger-hunt; and  the manner in which the mahout of his elephant had been pulled off his  seat by one of the infuriated animals.  How delighted Miss Rebecca was  at the Government balls, and how she laughed at the stories of the  Scotch aides-de-camp, and called Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#8)"],[1,"ake, as  a wounded boar is about the most dangerous beast on earth; and although  the poor brute kept snapping at the broken flax-stick sticking in his  heart, he fired a steady shot which brought the pig on his knees, only  to roll over dead the next moment.    I cannot help pausing to say that I sewed up Pincher's wound then and  there, with some of the contents of my Cambusmore house-wife; which  always accompanied me on my sporting expeditions, and we carried him  between us down to where the horses were fastened. There I mounted;  and F---- lifting the faithful creature on my lap, we rode slowly home,  dipping our handkerchiefs in cold water at every creek we crossed, and  laying them on his poor flank. He was as patient and brave as possible,  and bore his sufferings and weakness for days afterwards in a way  which was a lesson to one, so grateful and gentle was he. His brave  and sensible behaviour met its due reward in a complete though slow  recovery.    I have only left myself space for one little sketch more; but it comes  so vividly before me that I cannot shut it out. After a long day's  walking, over the hills and vallies, so beautiful beneath our azure  winter-sky, walking which was delightful as an expedition, but  unsuccessful as to sport, we crossed the track of a large boar. We knew  he was old by his being alone, and it was therefore very certain that he  would show fight if we came up with him. Patiently we followed the track  over a low saddle, through a clump of brushwood menuka, the broken twigs  of which showed how large an animal had just passed by. Here and there a  freshly grubbed-up Spaniard showed where he had paused for a snack; but  at length we dropped down on the river bed, with its wide expanse of  shingle, and there we lost all clue to our game.    After a little hesitation, F---- decided on climbing a high cliff on  the right bank of the river, and trying to catch a glimpse of him. The  opposite hill-side was gaunt and bare; a southern aspect shut out the  sun in winter, and for all its rich traces of copper ore, \"Holkam's  Head\" found no favour in the eyes of either shepherds or master. Grass  would not grow there except in summer, and its gray, shingly sides were  an eye-sore to its owner. We sat down on the cliff, and looked around  carefully. Presently F---- said, in a breathless whisper of intense  delight, \"I see him.\" In vain I looked and looked, but nothing could  my stupid eyes discover. \"Lie down,\" said F---- to me, just as if I had  been a dog. I crouched as low as possible, whilst F----settled himself  comfortably flat on his stomach, and prepared to take a careful aim at  the opposite side of the hill.    After what seemed a long time, he pulled his rifle's trigger, and the  flash and crack was followed apparently by one of the gray boulders  opposite leaping up, and then rolling heavily down the hill. F----  jumped up in triumph crying, \"Come along, and don't forget the  revolver.\" When we had crossed the river, reckless of getting wet to  our waists in icy-cold water, F---- took the revolver from me and went  first; but, after an instant's examination, he called out, \"Dead as a  door-nail! come and look at him.\" So I came, with great caution, and  a more repulsive and disgusting sight cannot be imagined than the huge  carcass of our victim already stiffening in death. The shot had been a  fortunate one, for only an inch away from the hole the bullet had made  his shoulders were regularly plated with thick horny scales, off which  a revolver bullet would have glanced harmlessly, and he bore marks of  having fought many and many a battle with younger rivals. His huge tusks  were notched and broken, and he had evidently been driven out from  among his fellows as a quarrelsome member of their society. Already the  keen-eyed hawks were hovering above the great monster, and we left him  to his fate in the solitary river gorge, where all was bleak and cold  and gloomy,--a fitting death-place for the fierce old warrior.        Chapter IV: Skating in the back country.      I do not believe that even in Canada the skating can be better than that  which was within our reach in the Malvern Hills. Among our sheltered  valleys an sunny slopes the hardest frost only lasted a few hour after  dawn; but twenty-five miles further back, on the border of the glacier  region, the mountain tarns could boast of ice several feet thick all the  winter. We heard rumours of far-inland lakes, across which heavily-laden  bullock-teams could pass in perfect safety for three months of the year,  and we grumbled at the light film over our own large ponds, which would  not bear even my little terrier's weight after mid-day: and yet it was  cold enough at night, during our short bright winters, to satisfy the  most icy-minded person. I think I have mentioned before that the wooden  houses in New Zealand, especially those roughly put together up-country,  are by no means weather-tight. Disagreeable as this may be, it is  doubtless the reason of the extraordinary immunity from colds and  coughs which we hill-dwellers enjoyed. Living between walls formed  by inch-boards over-lapping each other, and which can only be made to  resemble English rooms by being canvassed and papered inside, the pure  fresh air finds its way in on all sides. A hot room in winter is an  impossibility, in spite of drawn curtains and blazing fires, therefore  the risk of sudden changes of temperature is avoided.    Some such theory as this is absolutely necessary to account for the  wonderfully good health enjoyed by all, in the most capricious and  trying climate I have ever come across. When a strong nor'-wester was  howling down the glen, I have seen the pictures on my drawing-room walls  blowing out to an angle of 45 degrees, although every door and window in  the little low wooden structure had been carefully closed for hours. It  has happened to me more than once, on getting up in the morning, to find  my clothes, which had been laid on a chair beneath my bedroom window  overnight, completely covered by powdered snow, drifting in through the  ill-fitting casement. This same window was within a couple of feet of my  bed, and between me and it was neither curtain nor shelter of any sort.  Of a winter's evening I have often been obliged to wrap myself up in a  big Scotch maud, as I sat, dressed in a high linsey gown, by a blazing  fire, so hard was the frost outside; but by ten o'clock next morning  I would be loitering about the verandah, basking in the sunshine, and  watching the light flecks of cloud-wreaths and veils floating against  an Italian-blue sky. Yet such is the inherent discontent of the human  heart, that instead of rejoicing in this lovely mid-day sunshine, we  actually mourned over the vanished ice which at daylight had been found,  by a much-envied early riser, strong enough to slide on for half an  hour. It seemed almost impossible to believe that any one had been  sliding that morning within a few feet of where I sat working in a blaze  of sunshine, with my pretty grey and pink Australian parrot pluming  itself on the branch of a silver wattle close by, and \"Joey,\" the tiny  monkey from Panama, sitting on the skirt of my gown, with a piece of its  folds arranged by himself shawl-wise over his glossy black shoulders. If  either of these tropical pets had been left out after four o'clock that  sunny day, they, would have been frozen to death before our supper time.    It was just on such a day as this, and in just such a bright mid-day  hour, that a distant neighbour of ours rode up to the garden gate,  leading a pack horse. Outside the saddle-bags, with which this animal  was somewhat heavily laden, could be plainly seen a beautiful new pair  of Oxford skates, glinting in the sunshine; and it must have been the  sight of these beloved implements which called forth the half-envious  remark from one of the gentlemen, \"I suppose you have lots of skating up  at your place?\"    \"Well, not exactly at my station, but there is a capital lake ten miles  from my house where I am sure of a good day's skating any time between  June and August,\" answered Mr. C. H----, our newly arrived guest.    We all looked at each other. I believe I heaved a deep sigh, and dropped  my thimble, which \"Joey\" instantly seized, and with a low chirrup  of intense delight, commenced to poke down between the boards of the  verandah. It was too bad of us to give such broad hints by looks if not  by words. Poor Mr. C. H---- was a bachelor in those days: he had not  been at his little out-of-the-way homestead for some weeks, and was  ignorant of its resources in the way of firing (always an important  matter at a station), or even of tea and mutton. He had no  woman-servant, and was totally unprepared for an incursion of skaters;  and yet,--New Zealand fashion,--no sooner did he perceive that we were  all longing and pining for some skating, than he invited us all most  cordially to go up to his back-country run the very next day, with him,  and skate as long as we liked. This was indeed a delightful prospect,  the more especially as it happened to be only Monday, which gave us  plenty of time to be back again by Sunday, for our weekly service. We  made it a rule never to be away from home on that day, lest any of our  distant congregation should ride their twenty miles or so across country  and find us absent.    When the host is willing and the guests eager, it does not take long to  arrange a plan, so the next morning found three of us, besides Mr. C.  H---- mounted and ready to start directly after breakfast. I have often  been asked how I managed in those days about toilette arrangements, when  it was impossible to carry any luggage except a small \"swag,\" closely  packed in a waterproof case and fastened on the same side as the  saddle-pocket. First of all I must assure my lady readers that I prided  myself on turning out as neat "]]]
