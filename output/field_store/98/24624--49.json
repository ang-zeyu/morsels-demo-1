These boilers are therefore very wasteful, only  evaporating, when covered with lime scale, from two to three pounds of  water with one pound of the best coal, and requiring cleansing once  a week at the very least. The writer's interest being aroused, he  determined, if possible, to remedy these inconveniences, and accordingly  he made a careful study of the subject, and examined all the heaters  then in the market. He found them all, without exception, insufficient  to free the feed-water from the most dangerous of impurities, namely,  the sulphate and the carbonate of lime.    Taking the foregoing facts, well known to chemists and engineers, as the  basis of his operations, the writer perceived that all substances likely  to give trouble by deposition would be precipitated at a temperature of  about 250 deg. F.    His plan was, therefore, to make a feed-water heater in which the water  could be raised to that temperature before entering the boiler. Now, by  using the heat from the exhaust steam the water may be raised to between  208 deg. and 212 deg. F. It has yet to be raised to 250 deg. F.; and for this  purpose the writer saw at once the advantage that would be attained by  using a coil of live steam from the boiler. This device does not cause  any loss of steam, except the small loss due to radiation, since the  water in any case would have to be heated up to the temperature of the  steam on entering the boiler. By adopting this method, the chemical  precipitation, which would otherwise occur in the boiler, takes place  in the heater; and it is only necessary now to provide a filter, which  shall prevent anything passing that can possibly cause scale.    Having explained as briefly as possible the principles on which the  system is founded, the writer will now describe the details of the  heater itself.    In Figs. 1 and 2 are shown an elevation and a vertical section of  the heater. The cast-iron base, A, is divided into two parts by the  diaphragm, B. The exhaust steam enters at C, passes up the larger tubes,  D, which are fastened into the upper shell of the casting, returns by  the smaller tubes, E, which are inside the others, and passes away by  the passage, F. The inner tube only serves for discharge. It will be  seen at once that this arrangement, while securing great heating surface  in a small space, at the same time leaves freedom for expansion and  contraction, without producing strains. The free area for passage of  steam is arranged to be one and a half times that of the exhaust pipe,  so that there is no possible danger of back pressure. The wrought iron  shell, G, connecting the stand, A, with the dome, H, is made strong  enough to withstand the full boiler pressure. An ordinary casing, J,  of wood or other material prevents loss by radiation of heat. The  cold water from the pump passes into the heater through the injector  arrangement, K, and coming in contact with the tubes, D, is heated; it  then rises to the coil, L, which is supplied with steam from the boiler,  and thus becomes further heated, attaining there a temperature of from  250 deg. to 270 deg. F., according to the pressure in the boiler. This high  temperature causes the separation of the dissolved salts; and on the way  to the boiler the water passes through the filter, M, becoming thereby  freed from all precipitated matter before passing away to the boiler at  N. The purpose of the injector, K, and the pipe passing from O to K, is  to cause a continual passage of air or steam from the upper part of the  dome to the lower part of the heater, so that any precipitate carried up  in froth may be again returned to the under side of the filter, in order  more effectually to separate it, before any chance occurs of its passing  into the boiler.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Elevation. FIG. 2.--Vertical Section]    The filter consists of wood charcoal in the lower half and bone black  above firmly held between two perforated plates, as shown. After the  heater has been in use for from three to ten hours, according to the  nature of the water used, it is necessary to blow out the heater, in  order to clear the filter from deposit. To do this, the cock at R is  opened, and the water is discharged by the pressure from the boiler. The  steam is allowed to pass through the heater for some little time, in  order to clear the filter completely. After this operation, all is ready  to commence work again. By this means the filter remains fit for use for  months without change of the charcoal.    Where a jet condenser is used, either of two plans may be adopted. One  plan takes the feed-water from the hot well and passes the exhaust from  the feed pumps through the heater, using at the same time an increased  amount of coil for the live steam. By this means a temperature of water  is attained high enough to cause deposition, and at the same time to  produce decomposition of the oil brought over from the cylinders. The  other plan places the heater in the line of exhaust from the engine to  the condenser, also using a larger amount of coil. Both these methods  work well. The writer sometimes uses the steam from the coil to work the  feed pump; or, if the heater stands high enough, it is only necessary  to make a connection with the boiler, when the water formed by the  condensation of the steam runs back to the boiler, and thus the coil is  kept constantly at the necessary temperature.    In adapting the heater to locomotives, we were met with the difficulty  of want of space to put a heater sufficiently large to handle the  extremely large amount of water evaporated on a locomotive worked up to  its full capacity, being from 1,500 to 2,500 gallons per hour, or from  five hundred to one thousand h.p. We designed various forms of heaters  and tried them, but have finally decided on the one shown in the  engraving, Fig. 3, which consists of a lap welded tube, 13 inches  internal diameter, 12 feet long, with a cast-iron head which is divided  into two compartments or chambers by a diaphragm. Into this head are  screwed 60 tubes, one inch outside diameter and 12 feet long, which  are of seamless brass. These are the heating tubes, within which  are internal tubes for circulation only, which are screwed into the  diaphragm and extend to within a very short distance of the end of the  heating tube. The exhaust steam for heating is taken equally from both  sides of the locomotive by tapping a two-inch nipple with a cup shaped  extension on it in such a way as to catch a portion of the exhaust  without interfering with the free escape of the steam for the blast, and  without any back pressure, as it relieves the back pressure as much as  it condenses. The pipe from one side of the engine is connected with  the chamber into which the heating tubes are screwed, and is in direct  communication with them. The pipe from the other side is connected with  the chamber into which the circulating tubes are screwed. The beat of  the exhaust, working, as it does, on the quarters, causes a constant  sawing or backward and forward circulation of steam without any  discharge, and only the condensation is carried off.    The water is brought from the pump and discharged into the lower side of  the heater well forward, and passes around the heating tubes to the end,  when it is discharged into a pipe that carries it forward, either direct  to the check or into the purifier, which is located between the frames  under the boiler, and consists of a chamber in which are arranged a live  steam coil and a filter above the coil. The water coming in contact  with the coil, its temperature is increased from the temperature of the  exhaust, 210 deg., to about 250 deg. Fahr., which causes the separation of the  lime salts as before described, and it then passes through the filter  and direct to the boiler from above the filter, which is cleansed by  blowing back through it as before described.    One of these heaters lately tested showed a saving in coal of 22 per  cent, and an increase of evaporation of 1.09 pounds of water per pound  of coal.--_Franklin Journal_.           *       *       *       *       *          MONTEVERDE'S STATUE OF ARCHITECTURE.

A lady who allows remarks to be made upon a caller, who has just  left the room, commits not only a breach of etiquette, but a  positive rudeness and ill-natured act. It is quite easy to check  any such disposition by a grave reserve, and to turn the  conversation at once.    Calls in the country may be less ceremonious, and of longer  duration than those in the city.    It is an ostentation almost unkind for a lady to call upon a  friend in reduced circumstances, with any parade of her own wealth  in equipage or dress.    No mistress of the house may ever leave the room when there are  visitors in it.    It is a breach of etiquette for a caller, who is waiting the  entrance of the hostess, to open the piano, or to touch it if it  is open.    It is a breach of etiquette to walk round the room when waiting  for your hostess, examining the furniture or pictures.    It is a breach of etiquette for a caller to open or shut a door,  raise or lower a window curtain, or in any way alter the  arrangement of a room.    Many consider a clock on a drawing-room mantel a breach of  etiquette, as it seems to hint to visitors to keep early hours.    It is a breach of etiquette to turn your chair so as to bring your  back to any one seated near to you.    It is a breach of etiquette when making a call, to play with any  ornament in the room, finger the furniture or seem indeed to be  aware of anything but the company present.    To prolong a call to the next meal time is a positive rudeness, as  it forces your hostess to invite you to the table whether  convenient and agreeable or not.    In calling upon friends at a boardinghouse or a hotel, always  write their names above your own upon your card, that it may be  certain to be delivered to the right person.      CONVERSATION.    THERE are several principal rules of etiquette which must be  rigidly observed in conversation, the non-observance of which will  at once stamp the guilty party as ignorant of the forms and  customs of polite society.    Ungrammatical expressions are unfortunately too common even  amongst those who have not the excuse of ignorance, but who fall  into the use of them merely from carelessness, or unconscious  imitation of others. \"Says she to me,\" and other vulgarisms of a  like type, are also a gross violation of good taste in  conversation.    The personal pronouns should be used as little as possible when  speaking of any one, either present or absent. The name of the  lady or gentleman to whom reference is made should be repeated if  necessary, but under no circumstances should the words \"she\" or  \"he,\" accompanied by a nod or jerk of the thumb, in the direction  of the person spoken of, be employed. Never talk of any one with  whom you may have held intercourse as \"that party,\" or \"a party\"  of your acquaintance.    Avoid as utterly hateful the use of slang terms. There are surely  words enough in the English language to express all the thoughts  and ideas of the mind, and it is a sign of pure vulgarity to  employ synonyms, the only remarkable part of which is that they  derive their existence solely from vulgar sources. In a gentleman  such expressions are too suggestive of low company, and  intercourse with the worst associates, and in a lady such  expressions are too offensive to be tolerated at all in good  society. Slang never ornamented conversation, but it invariably  sullies and degrades it. Equally to be censured as a violation of  etiquette, and more so in a moral point of view, is the use of  profanity; it is a sure mark, not only of low-breeding, but of a  narrow, degraded if not a positively vicious mind. Lamont says:    \"Whatever fortune may be made by perjury, I believe there never  was a man who made a fortune by common swearing. It often appears  that men pay for swearing, but it seldom happens that  they are  paid for it. It is not easy to perceive what honor or credit is  connected with it. Does any man receive promotion because he is a  notable blusterer? Or is any man advanced to dignity because he is  expert at profane swearing? Never. Low must be the character which  such impertinence will exalt: high must be the character which  such impertinence will not degrade. Inexcusable, therefore, must  be the practice which has neither reason nor passion to support  it. The drunkard has his cups; the satirist his revenge; the  ambitious man his preferments; the miser his gold; but the common  swearer has nothing; he is a fool at large, sells his soul for  naught, and drudges in the service of the devil gratis. Swearing  is void of all plea, it is not the native offspring of the soul,  nor interwoven with the texture of the body, nor any how allied to  our frame. For, as Tillotson expresses it,'Though some men pour  out oaths as if they were natural, yet no man was ever born of a  swearing constitution.' But it is a custom, a low and paltry  custom, picked up by low and paltry spirits who have no sense of  honor, no regard to decency, but are forced to substitute some  rhapsody of nonsense to supply the vacancy of good sense. Hence  the silliness of the practice can only be equalled by the  silliness of those who adopt it.\"    It is exceedingly rude, nothing in fact can be more so, to talk to  any one person in the presence of others, in a language not  understood save by the two persons using it--unless you are  addressing a foreigner in his own tongue, and then others should  be made aware of the subject discussed. Nothing can be in worse  taste than to speak in an unknown tongue, to laugh and joke in a  language which leaves the rest of the company in ignorance whether  they themselves may not be the subjects of your remarks or mirth.    Never hold your companion, in a conversation, by the buttonhole.  If you are obliged to detain him forcibly in order to say what you  wish, you are pressing upon him what is disagreeable or unwelcome,  and you commit a gross breach of etiquette in so doing.    To speak to one person in a company in ambiguous terms, understood  by him alone, as \"G---, I saw Mr. H., to-day, and delivered your  message,\" is as rude as if you went up to G--- and whispered in  his ear.    Do not interlard your conversation with scraps of foreign  language. It is an affectation of knowledge in one direction, and  a sort of tacit admission of ignorance in another; for it would  seem to show that the speaker was not well enough acquainted with  his own language to be able to express by its aid that which could  really be told as well, perhaps better, by it than any other.  There are certain expressions, chiefly French, which have become  domesticated in the English language, and which may occasionally  be employed, but only when they come in very aptly; the constant  or extended use of them is intolerable in good society.    Quotations are to be avoided as much as possible. When made, they  should be exceedingly short. There can scarcely be a greater  annoyance to a company than for one person to take up all the time  and attention by reciting a poem, a speech, a passage from a book,  especially if it be the speaker's own book, speech or poem. Of  course, if the company meet especially for mutual enjoyment in  elocution or recitation, this rule does not apply. It is  applicable only for general society. Short, pungent, epigrammatic  quotations, if suitable to the subject of conversation, may be  occasionally introduced, but their use should be the exception,  not the rule.    Dr. Johnson says that in order to converse well, \"there must, in  the first place, be knowledge--there must be materials; in the  second place, there must be a command of words; in the third  place, there must be imagination to place things in such views as  they are not commonly seen in; and in the fourth place, there must  be a presence of mind, and a resolution that is not to be overcome  by failure--this last is an essential requisite; for want of it  many people do not excel in conversation.\"     To be known as an inveterate teller of stories, is a great injury  to a man in society. A short, brilliant anecdote, that is  especially applicable to the conversation, known to be new and  never printed, is all that a well-bred man will ever permit  himself to inflict.    Remarks having, and intended to have, a double meaning--even puns  --are utterly to be deprecated. It is a great liberty to appeal to  the private sympathies of any one, by which I mean, to those  qualities or perceptions which are, as it were, a man's private  property, available for the use of his intimate friends, but not  for the general public. It seems almost needless to say that under  no circumstances whatever are any coarse allusions permissible.    Trite remarks are simply drags upon conversation, and may produce  awkward effects. It is told of Charles Lamb, that he was one day  at dinner at a friend's house, where amongst a number of literary  men was a solitary individual who had been invited for no apparent  reason. The poor man thought that, being in such company, it  behoved him to talk of some one or something literary. In an evil  moment he said, without being conscious of the triteness of his  remark: \"Do you not think, sir, that Milton was a great genius?\"  Charles Lamb gazed at him curiously, rose, went to the sideboard  and lighted a candle, with which he advanced, in solemn wise, to  where the trite talker sat, and said as one who is about to look  at some unusual object of interest-holding his candle near the  poor man's head the while: \"Will you allow me to examine this  gentleman's pericranium?\" Lamb was undoubtedly rude, but the other  gave him enormous provocation.    Political and religious topics are not in good taste in general  conversation. It is almost impossible to avoid strong personal  feeling when a difference of opinion arises, and such discussions  almost invariably lead to more warmth of expression and violence  of argument"]]]
