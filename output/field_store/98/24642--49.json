Started at 10.10 a.m. on the  same bearing as yesterday, 120 degrees, and at four miles ascended the  peak on the range. I see around me a scrubby country, with open patches,  and here and there in the far distance what appear to be belts of mulga.  Four miles beyond this hill we halted at some rain water. We have seen  three or four kangaroos to-day; they were the red sort with white  breasts. Distance travelled, eight miles.    Wednesday 21st July, Grass and Salt-Bush Plains. Left the camp at 9 a.m.  on a bearing of 97 degrees. Camped at some rain water in a clay-pan. At  twelve miles there is low rising ground running north-west and  south-east, which divides the two plains; there are no creeks, but the  dip of the country is to the south-west. This is as fine a salt-bush and  grass country as I have seen. It is a pity there is no permanent water.  Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Thursday, 22nd July, Open, Good Country. Started at 9 a.m. on the same  course as yesterday, 97 degrees. At ten miles crossed a small watercourse  running to the south-south-west; at sixteen miles came through the saddle  of a low range running north-west and south-east composed of limestone;  it forms one of the boundaries of a large plain, which seems well adapted  for pastoral purposes; it is well grassed, with salt bush, although we  could find no permanent water. I think I can see a gum creek to the east  of us, but the mirage is so powerful that I am not quite certain.  Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Friday, 23rd July, Large East Plain. Started at 9.10 a.m. on a bearing of  82 degrees, and at four miles ascended an isolated hill, but can see  nothing of the gum creek. Changed our course to 122 degrees, and at four  miles crossed a mulga creek running to the east. Camped on the south-east  side of a flat-topped hill, which, although the highest I have yet seen,  enabled me to see nothing but the range to the north-east, and a high  conical hill about ten miles south-west, connected with the ranges. The  country is without timber except a few mulga bushes at intervals.  Distance to-day, twenty-one miles.    Saturday, 24th July, South-east Side of Flat-topped Hill. Left at 8.10  a.m. on the same course, 122 degrees, over an undulating stony plain,  with narrow sand hills at intervals, and a number of lagoons containing  rain water, where we camped. I intend to move to-morrow to another large  lagoon that we have seen from a small rise, and rest the horses there;  they have had a very severe day of it, and feel the want of shoes very  much. The stones are mostly white quartz and ironstone, small and  water-washed. I conclude they have come from the hills that are to the  south-west. Distance to-day, twenty-four miles.    Sunday, 25th July, A Lagoon of Rain Water. Finding that we have sand  hills to cross, and being anxious to meet with the gum creek that the  blacks have talked about, I have determined to proceed to-day, but if I  do not find it on this course I shall turn to the south. Started at eight  a.m. on a bearing of 122 degrees. At five miles, one mile to the south is  a large reedy swamp. At fourteen miles changed the bearing to 135 degrees  to the head of a swamp, two miles and a half, found it dry, a large  clay-pan about three miles in circumference. I am obliged to halt, the  horses are very tired and want rest; and there being plenty of beautiful  green feed about, I have halted without water. Our journey has been  through a very thick mulga scrub and sand hills, very heavy travelling.  The trees in the scrub are of a different description to any that I have  seen; they grow high and very crooked, without branches until near the  top, and with a rough, ragged bark; seven or eight seem to spring from  one root. The wood is very tough and heavy, and burns a long time, giving  out a glowing heat. The leaves resemble the mulga, but are of a darker  colour and smaller size. The native name is Moratchee. Shot a wallaby,  and had him for dinner. They are very wild, no getting within shot of  them, which is unfortunate, as our provisions are getting rather short.  From the number of native tracks about, this would seem to be their  season for hunting in the sand hills, which accounts for everything being  so wild. We saw five turkeys yesterday, but could not get within shot of  them. All the water seems to drain into the reedy swamp and clay-pans. I  shall go no further to the east on this course, for I can see no  inducement. I shall go south to-morrow, and see what that produces; if I  cross no large creek within forty-five miles in that direction, I shall  then direct my course for the north-west of Fowler's Bay to see what is  there. Distance to-day, sixteen miles.    Monday, 27th July, Sand Hills and Dense Scrub. Left our camp at 9.20 a.m.  on a southerly course, 182 degrees. At thirteen miles we camped at some  rain water to give the horses a little rest. We have come through a very  thick scrub of mulga, with broken sand hills and a few low rises of lime  and ironstone. We have seen two or three pines for the first time, and a  few black oaks. No appearance of a change of country. From a high sand  ridge I could see a long way to the north-east, seemingly all a dense  scrub. The grey mare is unwell again. Distance to-day, thirteen miles.    Tuesday, 27th July, Sandy Undulations. Started at 9 a.m. on the same  bearing as yesterday, 182 degrees. At twenty-one miles changed our course  to 235 degrees to some gum-trees. The first part of our journey the scrub  became lower and more open, with limestone and sand rises at intervals,  and with a good deal of grass in places. The last ten miles the mulga  scrub was so dense that it was with difficulty we managed to get through.  We have seen no water on this day's route, except that in the lagoon we  are now camped at, and which is as salt as the sea. There is another  large lagoon about a mile to the westward of us, which I will examine  to-morrow to see if it gives rise to any creek. Distance to-day,  twenty-two miles.    Wednesday, 28th July, Sand Hills. Started at 9 a.m. on a bearing of 283  degrees for two miles to examine the other lagoon, which is about three  miles long, water salt. Changed our course to 182 degrees for ten miles  to a large lake crossing our course. Changed our bearing to 240 degrees,  and at four miles changed to 270 degrees, crossing some horse-tracks  going towards the large lake. This seems to be a country of salt lagoons,  for we passed three, and have seen a great many more. The large one that  crossed our south course is evidently the head of Lake Gairdner. I could  see it winding away in that direction. We have now got upon a plain  slightly undulating with thick scrub and the unceasing mulga, intermixed  with a few black oaks; no signs of water, no creeks. I intend to proceed  north of west to intersect any creek or country that may come from the  good country that we found on our south-east course, and the land of  kangaroos; there is no hope of anything here. Camped without water.  Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Thursday, 29th July, Mulga Plain, West of Lake Gairdner. Our course  to-day is 310 degrees. Left our camp at 8.30, and accomplished twenty  miles of the same scrubby plain, slightly undulating. Plenty of grass,  but no water. Same description of country as on the 18th instant.    Friday, 30th July, Mulga Plain. Started at 7.35 on same course, 310  degrees. The scrub is so dense that I cannot see above one hundred yards  ahead, and sometimes not that. During the night some swans and two ducks  flew over, apparently from Lake Gairdner, and going in our direction. At  ten miles, having met with some rain water, we halted, for the horses had  been three nights without it. I have given them the rest of the day to  drink their fill. This seems to be a continuation of the stony plain we  crossed on our south-eastern line. The country appears open to the south,  but no sign of any permanent water. Forster bakes the last of our flour  this afternoon--the last of our provisions. Distance to-day, ten miles.    Saturday, 31st July, South Stony Plain. Left at 8.30 on the same bearing,  310 degrees. At ten miles we ascended a low range running north and  south. We did not see a drop of water all day. Our course was over a  gradually rising plain, well grassed at intervals, with plenty of salt  bush, and with stone on the surface, composed of quartz, ironstone, and  the hard white flinty stone so frequently met with. The scrub has nearly  ceased. The dip of the country is south. During the night we again heard  a dog barking at one of the horses, and during the day we saw two  kangaroos. At ten miles we crossed a valley, through which water has been  flowing to the south-south-west. Camped without water. Distance to-day,  fifteen miles.    Sunday, 1st August, Stony Plain Valley. Left at 8.45 on the same bearing,  310 degrees. My reason for keeping this bearing is that there seems to  have been very little rain to the south of us, and I am unwilling to get  too far away from where it has fallen, in case I have to put to my former  line for it. If I should meet with it to-day I shall turn south-west or  west. This country is very dry, and absorbs all that falls. It is of a  bright red soil, mixed with sand and, in some places, lime. At ten miles  I am obliged to stop, in consequence of the grey mare being quite done  up; the stones play the mischief with her. I have great doubts of her  living through the journey. Distance to-day, ten miles.    Monday, 2nd August, Salt Bush--a Stony Plain. We had a little rain during  the night. Started at 9 on a bearing of 315 degrees. At three miles  changed our course to 230 degrees. The last three miles of this day's  journey were through rather a thick scrub, but well grassed, with few  stones. The former part was through a very well-grassed country, with a  little salt "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#8)"],[1,"e.    Bit by bit, like a doom came the necessity to know. He was hit in the  head. It was only a vague surmise at first. But in the swinging of the  pendulum of pain, swinging ever nearer and nearer, to touch him into an  agony of consciousness and a consciousness of agony, gradually the  knowledge emerged--he must be hit in the head--hit on the left brow; if  so, there would be blood--was there blood?--could he feel blood in his  left eye? Then the clanging seemed to burst the membrane of his brain,  like death-madness.    Was there blood on his face? Was hot blood flowing? Or was it dry blood  congealing down his cheek? It took him hours even to ask the question:  time being no more than an agony in darkness, without measurement.    A long time after he had opened his eyes he realized he was seeing  something--something, something, but the effort to recall what was too  great. No, no; no recall!    Were they the stars in the dark sky? Was it possible it was stars in the  dark sky? Stars? The world? Ah, no, he could not know it! Stars and the  world were gone for him, he closed his eyes. No stars, no sky, no world.  No, No! The thick darkness of blood alone. It should be one great lapse  into the thick darkness of blood in agony.    Death, oh, death! The world all blood, and the blood all writhing with  death. The soul like the tiniest little light out on a dark sea, the sea  of blood. And the light guttering, beating, pulsing in a windless storm,  wishing it could go out, yet unable.    There had been life. There had been Winifred and his children. But the  frail death-agony effort to catch at straws of memory, straws of life  from the past, brought on too great a nausea. No, No! No Winifred, no  children. No world, no people. Better the agony of dissolution ahead than  the nausea of the effort backwards. Better the terrible work should go  forward, the dissolving into the black sea of death, in the extremity of  dissolution, than that there should be any reaching back towards life. To  forget! To forget! Utterly, utterly to forget, in the great forgetting of  death. To break the core and the unit of life, and to lapse out on the  great darkness. Only that. To break the clue, and mingle and commingle  with the one darkness, without afterwards or forwards. Let the black sea  of death itself solve the problem of futurity. Let the will of man break  and give up.    What was that? A light! A terrible light! Was it figures? Was it legs of  a horse colossal--colossal above him: huge, huge?    The Germans heard a slight noise, and started. Then, in the glare of a  light-bomb, by the side of the heap of earth thrown up by the shell, they  saw the dead face.          _Tickets, Please_      There is in the Midlands a single-line tramway system which boldly  leaves the county town and plunges off into the black, industrial  countryside, up hill and down dale, through the long ugly villages of  workmen's houses, over canals and railways, past churches perched high  and nobly over the smoke and shadows, through stark, grimy cold little  market-places, tilting away in a rush past cinemas and shops down to the  hollow where the collieries are, then up again, past a little rural  church, under the ash trees, on in a rush to the terminus, the last  little ugly place of industry, the cold little town that shivers on the  edge of the wild, gloomy country beyond. There the green and creamy  coloured tram-car seems to pause and purr with curious satisfaction. But  in a few minutes--the clock on the turret of the Co-operative Wholesale  Society's Shops gives the time--away it starts once more on the  adventure. Again there are the reckless swoops downhill, bouncing the  loops: again the chilly wait in the hill-top market-place: again the  breathless slithering round the precipitous drop under the church: again  the patient halts at the loops, waiting for the outcoming car: so on and  on, for two long hours, till at last the city looms beyond the fat  gas-works, the narrow factories draw near, we are in the sordid streets  of the great town, once more we sidle to a standstill at our terminus,  abashed by the great crimson and cream-coloured city cars, but still  perky, jaunty, somewhat dare-devil, green as a jaunty sprig of parsley  out of a black colliery garden.    To ride on these cars is always an adventure. Since we are in war-time,  the drivers are men unfit for active service: cripples and hunchbacks.  So they have the spirit of the devil in them. The ride becomes a  steeple-chase. Hurray! we have leapt in a clear jump over the canal  bridges--now for the four-lane corner. With a shriek and a trail of  sparks we are clear again. To be sure, a tram often leaps the rails--but  what matter! It sits in a ditch till other trams come to haul it out. It  is quite common for a car, packed with one solid mass of living people,  to come to a dead halt in the midst of unbroken blackness, the heart of  nowhere on a dark night, and for the driver and the girl conductor to  call, 'All get off--car's on fire!' Instead, however, of rushing out in a  panic, the passengers stolidly reply: 'Get on--get on! We're not coming  out. We're stopping where we are. Push on, George.' So till flames  actually appear.    The reason for this reluctance to dismount is that the nights are  howlingly cold, black, and windswept, and a car is a haven of refuge.  From village to village the miners travel, for a change of cinema, of  girl, of pub. The trams are desperately packed. Who is going to risk  himself in the black gulf outside, to wait perhaps an hour for another  tram, then to see the forlorn notice 'Depot Only', because there is  something wrong! Or to greet a unit of three bright cars all so tight  with people that they sail past with a howl of derision. Trams that pass  in the night.    This, the most dangerous tram-service in England, as the authorities  themselves declare, with pride, is entirely conducted by girls, and  driven by rash young men, a little crippled, or by delicate young men,  who creep forward in terror. The girls are fearless young hussies. In  their ugly blue uniform, skirts up to their knees, shapeless old  peaked caps on their heads, they have all the _sang-froid_ of an old  non-commissioned officer. With a tram packed with howling colliers,  roaring hymns downstairs and a sort of antiphony of obscenities upstairs,  the lasses are perfectly at their ease. They pounce on the youths who try  to evade their ticket-machine. They push off the men at the end of their  distance. They are not going to be done in the eye--not they. They fear  nobody--and everybody fears them.    'Hello, Annie!'    'Hello, Ted!'    'Oh, mind my corn, Miss Stone. It's my belief you've got a heart of  stone, for you've trod on it again.'    'You should keep it in your pocket,' replies Miss Stone, and she goes  sturdily upstairs in her high boots.    'Tickets, please.'    She is peremptory, suspicious, and ready to hit first. She can hold her  own against ten thousand. The step of that tram-car is her Thermopylae.    Therefore, there is a certain wild romance aboard these cars--and in the  sturdy bosom of Annie herself. The time for soft romance is in the  morning, between ten o'clock and one, when things are rather slack: that  is, except market-day and Saturday. Thus Annie has time to look about  her. Then she often hops off her car and into a shop where she has spied  something, while the driver chats in the main road. There is very good  feeling between the girls and the drivers. Are they not companions in  peril, shipments aboard this careering vessel of a tram-car, for ever  rocking on the waves of a stormy land?    Then, also, during the easy hours, the inspectors are most in evidence.  For some reason, everybody employed in this tram-service is young: there  are no grey heads. It would not do. Therefore the inspectors are of the  right age, and one, the chief, is also good-looking. See him stand on a  wet, gloomy morning, in his long oil-skin, his peaked cap well down over  his eyes, waiting to board a car. His face is ruddy, his small brown  moustache is weathered, he has a faint impudent smile. Fairly tall and  agile, even in his waterproof, he springs aboard a car and greets Annie.    'Hello, Annie! Keeping the wet out?'    'Trying to.'    There are only two people in the car. Inspecting is soon over. Then for a  long and impudent chat on the foot-board, a good, easy, twelve-mile chat.    The inspector's name is John Thomas Raynor--always called John Thomas,  except sometimes, in malice, Coddy. His face sets in fury when he is  addressed, from a distance, with this abbreviation. There is considerable  scandal about John Thomas in half a dozen villages. He flirts with the  girl conductors in the morning, and walks out with them in the dark  night, when they leave their tram-car at the depot. Of course, the girls  quit the service frequently. Then he flirts and walks out with the  newcomer: always providing she is sufficiently attractive, and that she  will consent to walk. It is remarkable, however, that most of the girls  are quite comely, they are all young, and this roving life aboard the car  gives them a sailor's dash and recklessness. What matter how they behave  when the ship is in port. Tomorrow they will be aboard again.    Annie, however, was something of a Tartar, and her sharp tongue had kept  John Thomas at arm's length for many months. Perhaps, therefore, she  liked him all the more: for he always came up smiling, with impudence.  She watched him vanquish one girl, then another. She could tell by the  movement of his mouth and eyes, when he flirted with her in the morning,  that he had been walking out with this lass, or the other, the night  before. A fine cock-of-the-walk he was. She could sum him up pretty well.    In this subtle antagonism they knew each other like old friends, they  were as shrewd with one another almost as"]]]
