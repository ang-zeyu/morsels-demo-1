The sagacious Hurons refused them a passage through their country to the  French; and the Neutrals apparently had not sense or reflection enough  to take the easy and direct route of Lake Ontario, which was probably  open to them, though closed against the Hurons by Iroquois enmity. Thus  the former made excellent profit by exchanging French goods at high  rates for the valuable furs of the Neutrals. [37]    [37] The Hurons became very jealous, when La Roche Dallion visited the  Neutrals, lest a direct trade should be opened between the latter and  the French, against whom they at once put in circulation a variety of  slanders: that they were a people who lived on snakes and venom; that  they were furnished with tails; and that French women, though having but  one breast, bore six children at a birth. The missionary nearly lost his  life in consequence, the Neutrals conceiving the idea that he would  infect their country with a pestilence.--La Roche Dallion, in Le Clerc,  I. 346.    Southward and eastward of Lake Erie dwelt a kindred people, the Eries,  or Nation of the Cat. Little besides their existence is known of them.  They seem to have occupied Southwestern New York, as far east as the  Genesee, the frontier of the Senecas, and in habits and language to have  resembled the Hurons. [38] They were noted warriors, fought with  poisoned arrows, and were long a terror to the neighboring Iroquois.  [39]    [38] Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1648, 46.  [39] Le Mercier, Relation, 1654, 10.--\"Nous les appellons la Nation  Chat, Ã  cause qu'il y a dans leur pais vne quantitÃ© prodigieuse de Chats  sauuages.\"--Ibid.--The Iroquois are said to have given the same name,  Jegosasa, Cat Nation, to the Neutrals.--Morgan, League of the Iroquois,  41.

The Jesuits never had  a mission among them, though they seem to have been visited by  Champlain's adventurous interpreter, Ãtienne BrulÃ©, in the summer of  1615.--They are probably the CarantoÃ¼ans of Champlain.    On the Lower Susquehanna dwelt the formidable tribe called by the French  Andastes. Little is known of them, beyond their general resemblance to  their kindred, in language, habits, and character. Fierce and resolute  warriors, they long made head against the Iroquois of New York, and were  vanquished at last more by disease than by the tomahawk. [40]    [40] Gallatin erroneously places the Andastes on the Alleghany, Bancroft  and others adopting the error. The research of Mr. Shea has shown their  identity with the Susquehannocks of the English, and the Minquas of the  Dutch.--See Hist. Mag., II. 294.    Synonymes: Andastes, Andastracronnons, Andastaeronnons, Andastaguez,  Antastoui (French), Susquehannocks (English), Mengwe, Minquas (Dutch),  Conestogas, Conessetagoes (English).    In Central New York, stretching east and west from the Hudson to the  Genesee, lay that redoubted people who have lent their name to the  tribal family of the Iroquois, and stamped it indelibly on the early  pages of American history. Among all the barbarous nations of the  continent, the Iroquois of New York stand paramount. Elements which  among other tribes were crude, confused, and embryotic, were among them  systematized and concreted into an established polity. The Iroquois was  the Indian of Indians. A thorough savage, yet a finished and developed  savage, he is perhaps an example of the highest elevation which man can  reach without emerging from his primitive condition of the hunter. A  geographical position, commanding on one hand the portal of the Great  Lakes, and on the other the sources of the streams flowing both to the  Atlantic and the Mississippi, gave the ambitious and aggressive  confederates advantages which they perfectly understood, and by which  they profited to the utmost. Patient and politic as they were ferocious,  they were not only conquerors of their own race, but the powerful allies  and the dreaded foes of the French and English colonies, flattered and  caressed by both, yet too sagacious to give themselves without reserve  to either. Their organization and their history evince their intrinsic  superiority. Even their traditionary lore, amid its wild puerilities,  shows at times the stamp of an energy and force in striking contrast  with the flimsy creations of Algonquin fancy. That the Iroquois, left  under their institutions to work out their destiny undisturbed, would  ever have developed a civilization of their own, I do not believe. These  institutions, however, are sufficiently characteristic and curious, and  we shall soon have occasion to observe them. [41]    [41] The name Iroquois is French. Charlevoix says: \"Il a Ã©tÃ© formÃ© du  terme Hiro, ou Hero, qui signifie J'ai dit, et par lequel ces sauvages  finissent tous leur discours, comme les Latins faisoient autrefois par  leur Dixi; et de KouÃ©, qui est un cri tantÃ´t de tristesse, lorsqu'on le  prononce en traÃ®nant, et tantÃ´t de joye, quand on le prononce plus  court.\"--Hist. de la N. F., I. 271.--Their true name is Hodenosaunee, or  People of the Long House, because their confederacy of five distinct  nations, ranged in a line along Central New York, was likened to one of  the long bark houses already described, with five fires and five  families. The name Agonnonsionni, or Aquanuscioni, ascribed to them by  Lafitau and Charlevoix, who translated it \"House-Makers,\" Faiseurs de  Cabannes, may be a conversion of the true name with an erroneous  rendering. The following are the true names of the five nations  severally, with their French and English synonymes. For other synonymes,  see \"History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac,\" 8, note.                    English         French  Ganeagaono,     Mohawk,         Agnier.

The Iroquois termination in ono--or onon, as the French write it--simply  means people.      SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.    In Indian social organization, a problem at once suggests itself. In  these communities, comparatively populous, how could spirits so fierce,  and in many respects so ungoverned, live together in peace, without law  and without enforced authority? Yet there were towns where savages lived  together in thousands with a harmony which civilization might envy. This  was in good measure due to peculiarities of Indian character and habits.  This intractable race were, in certain external respects, the most  pliant and complaisant of mankind. The early missionaries were charmed  by the docile acquiescence with which their dogmas were received; but  they soon discovered that their facile auditors neither believed nor  understood that to which they had so promptly assented. They assented  from a kind of courtesy, which, while it vexed the priests, tended  greatly to keep the Indians in mutual accord. That well-known  self-control, which, originating in a form of pride, covered the savage  nature of the man with a veil, opaque, though thin, contributed not a  little to the same end. Though vain, arrogant, boastful, and vindictive,  the Indian bore abuse and sarcasm with an astonishing patience. Though  greedy and grasping, he was lavish without stint, and would give away  his all to soothe the manes of a departed relative, gain influence and  applause, or ingratiate himself with his neighbors. In his dread of  public opinion, he rivalled some of his civilized successors.    All Indians, and especially these populous and stationary tribes, had  their code of courtesy, whose requirements were rigid and exact; nor  might any infringe it without the ban of public censure. Indian nature,  inflexible and unmalleable, was peculiarly under the control of custom.  Established usage took the place of law,--was, in fact, a sort of common  law, with no tribunal to expound or enforce it. In these wild  democracies,--democracies in spirit, though not in form,--a respect for  native superiority, and a willingness to yield to it, were always  conspicuous. All were prompt to aid each other in distress, and a  neighborly spirit was often exhibited among them. When a young woman was  permanently married, the other women of the village supplied her with  firewood for the year, each contributing an armful. When one or more  families were without shelter, the men of the village joined in building  them a house. In return, the recipients of the favor gave a feast, if  they could; if not, their thanks were sufficient. [42] Among the  Iroquois and Hurons--and doubtless among the kindred tribes--there were  marked distinctions of noble and base, prosperous and poor; yet, while  there was food in the village, the meanest and the poorest need not  suffer want. He had but to enter the nearest house, and seat himself by  the fire, when, without a word on either side, food was placed before  him by the women. [43]    [42] The following testimony concerning Indian charity and hospitality  is from Ragueneau: \"As often as we have seen tribes broken up, towns  destroyed, and their people driven to flight, we have seen them, to the  number of seven or eight hundred persons, received with open arms by  charitable hosts, who gladly gave them aid, and even distributed among  them a part of the lands already planted, that they might have the means  of living.\"--Relation, 1650, 28.  [43] The Jesuit BrÃ©beuf, than whom no one knew the Hurons better, is  very emphatic in praise of their harmony and social spirit. Speaking of  one of the four nations of which the Hurons were composed, he says: \"Ils  ont vne douceur et vne affabilitÃ© quasi incroyable pour des Sauuages;  ils ne se picquent pas aisÃ©ment.... Ils se maintiennent dans cette si  parfaite intelligence par les frequentes visites, les secours qu'il"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#8)"],[1,"condenser_ connected in the _closed circuit of a direct coupled  receiving set_, that is, one where a double slide tuning coil is used,  makes it easy to tune very much more sharply; a variable condenser is  absolutely necessary where the circuits are _inductively coupled_,  that is, where a loose coupled tuner is used.    A fixed condenser consists of a number of sheets of paper with leaves  of tin-foil in between them and so built up that one end of every  other leaf of tin-foil projects from the opposite end of the paper as  shown at A in Fig. 13. The paper and tin-foil are then pressed  together and impregnated with an insulating compound. A fixed  condenser of the exact capacitance required for connecting across the  head phones is mounted in a base fitted with binding posts, as shown  at B, and costs 75 cents. (Paper ones 25 cents.)    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 13.--How a Fixed Receiving Condenser is Built  up.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 13.--The Fixed Condenser Complete.]    [Illustration: (C) and (D) Fig. 13.--The Variable Rotary Condenser.]    A variable condenser, see C, of the rotating type is formed of a set  of fixed semi-circular metal plates which are slightly separated from  each other and between these a similar set of movable semi-circular  metal plates is made to interleave; the latter are secured to a shaft  on the top end of which is a knob and by turning it the capacitance of  the condenser, and, hence, of the circuit in which it is connected, is  varied. This condenser, which is shown at D, is made in two sizes, the  smaller one being large enough for all ordinary wave lengths while the  larger one is for proportionately longer wave lengths. These  condensers cost $4.00 and $5.00 respectively.    About Telephone Receivers.--There are a number of makes of head  telephone receivers on the market that are designed especially for  wireless work. These phones are wound to _resistances_ of from 75  _ohms_ to 8,000 _ohms_, and cost from $1.25 for a receiver  without a cord or headband to $15.00 for a pair of phones with a cord  and head band. You can get a receiver wound to any resistance in  between the above values but for either of the simple receiving sets  such as described in this chapter you ought to have a pair wound to at  least 2,000 ohms and these will cost you about $5.00. A pair of head  phones of this type is shown in Fig. 14.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Pair of Wireless Head Phones.]    Connecting Up the Parts--Receiving Set No. 1.--For this set get (1) a  _crystal detector_, (2) a _two-slide tuning coil_, (3) a _fixed  condenser_, and (4) a pair of 2,000 ohm head phones. Mount the  detector on the right-hand side of a board and the tuning coil on the  left-hand side. Screw in two binding posts for the cord ends of the  telephone receivers at _a_ and _b_ as shown at A in Fig. 15. This done  connect one of the end binding posts of the tuning coil with the  ground wire and a post of one of the contact slides with the lightning  arrester or switch which leads to the aerial wire.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Top View of Apparatus Layout for Receiving  Set No. 1.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 15.--Wiring Diagram for Receiving Set No. 1.]    Now connect the post of the other contact slide to one of the posts of  the detector and the other post of the latter with the binding post  _a_, then connect the binding post _b_ to the ground wire and solder  the joint. Next connect the ends of the telephone receiver cord to the  posts _a_ and _b_ and connect a fixed condenser also with these posts,  all of which are shown in the wiring diagram at B, and you are ready  to adjust the set for receiving.    Receiving Set No. 2.--Use the same kind of a detector and pair of head  phones as for _Set No. 1_, but get (1) a _loose coupled tuning coil_,  and (2) a _variable condenser_. Mount the loose coupler at the back of  a board on the left-hand side and the variable condenser on the  right-hand side. Then mount the detector in front of the variable  condenser and screw two binding posts, _a_ and _b_, in front of the  tuning coil as shown at A in Fig. 16.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Top view of Apparatus Layout for Receiving  Set No. 2.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 16.--Wiring Diagram for Receiving Set No. 2.]    Now connect the post of the sliding contact of the loose coupler with  the wire that runs to the lightning switch and thence to the aerial;  connect the post of the primary coil, which is the outside coil, with  the ground wire; then connect the binding post leading to the switch  of the secondary coil, which is the inside coil, with one of the posts  of the variable condenser, and finally, connect the post that is  joined to one end of the secondary coil with the other post of the  variable condenser.    This done, connect one of the posts of the condenser with one of the  posts of the detector, the other post of the detector with the binding  post _a_, and the post _b_ to the other post of the variable  condenser. Next connect a fixed condenser to the binding posts _a_ and  _b_ and then connect the telephone receivers to these same posts, all  of which is shown in the wiring diagram at B. You are now ready to  adjust the instruments. In making the connections use No. 16 or 18  insulated copper wire and scrape the ends clean where they go into the  binding posts. See, also, that all of the connections are tight and  where you have to cross the wires keep them apart by an inch or so and  always cross them at right angles.    Adjusting the No. 1 Set--The Detector.--The first thing to do is to  test the detector in order to find out if the point of the contact  wire is on a sensitive spot of the crystal. To do this you need a  _buzzer_, a _switch_ and a _dry cell_. An electric bell from which the  gong has been removed will do for the buzzer, but you can get one that  is made specially for the purpose, for 75 cents, which gives out a  clear, high-pitched note that sounds like a high-power station.    Connect one of the binding posts of the buzzer with one post of the  switch, the other post of the latter with the zinc post of the dry  cell and the carbon post of this to the other post of the buzzer. Then  connect the post of the buzzer that is joined to the vibrator, to the  ground wire as shown in the wiring diagram, Fig. 17. Now close the  switch of the buzzer circuit, put on your head phones, and move the  wire point of the detector to various spots on the crystal until you  hear the sparks made by the buzzer in your phones.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Adjusting the Receiving Set.]    Then vary the pressure of the point on the crystal until you hear the  sparks as loud as possible. After you have made the adjustment open  the switch and disconnect the buzzer wire from the ground wire of your  set. This done, be very careful not to jar the detector or you will  throw it out of adjustment and then you will have to do it all over  again. You are now ready to tune the set with the tuning coil and  listen in.    The Tuning Coil.--To tune this set move the slide A of the  double-slide tuner, see B in Fig. 15, over to the end of the coil that  is connected with the ground wire and the slide B near the opposite  end of the coil, that is, the one that has the free end. Now move the  slide A toward the B slide and when you hear the dots and dashes, or  speech or music, that is coming in as loud as you can move the B slide  toward the A slide until you hear still more loudly. A very few trials  on your part and you will be able to tune in or tune out any station  you can hear, if not too close or powerful.    [Illustration: original (C) Underwood and Underwood. The World's  Largest Radio Receiving Station. Owned by the Radio Corporation of  America at Rocky Point near Point Jefferson, L.I.]    Adjusting the No. 2 Set.--First adjust the crystal detector with the  buzzer set as described above with _Set No. 1,_ then turn the knob of  your variable condenser so that the movable plates are just half-way  in, pull the secondary coil of your loose-coupled tuner half way out;  turn the switch lever on it until it makes a contact with the middle  contact point and set the slider of the primary coil half way between  the ends.    Now listen in for telegraphic signals or telephonic speech or music;  when you hear one or the other slide the secondary coil in and out of  the primary coil until the sounds are loudest; now move the contact  switch over the points forth and back until the sounds are still  louder, then move the slider to and fro until the sounds are yet  louder and, finally, turn the knob of the condenser until the sounds  are clear and crisp. When you have done all of these things you have,  in the parlance of the wireless operator, _tuned in_ and you are ready  to receive whatever is being sent.          CHAPTER IV    SIMPLE TELEGRAPH SENDING SETS      A wireless telegraph transmitting set can be installed for a very  small amount of money provided you are content with one that has a  limited range. Larger and better instruments can, of course, be had  for more money, but however much you are willing to spend still you  are limited in your sending radius by the Government's rules and  regulations. The best way, and the cheapest in the end, to install a  telegraph set is to buy the separate parts and hook them up yourself.    The usual type of wireless telegraph transmitter employs a _disruptive  discharge,_ or _spark,_ as it is called, for setting up the  oscillating currents in the aerial wire system and this is the type of  apparatus described in this chapter. There are two ways to set up the  sparks and these are: (1) with an _induction coil,_ or _spark-coil,_  as it is commonly called, and (2) with an _alternating current  transformer_, or _power transformer_, as it is sometimes called. Where  you have to generate the current with a battery you must use a spark  coil, but if you have a 110-vo"]]]
