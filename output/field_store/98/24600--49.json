[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#8)"],[1,"iron that brands me with such a charge!--But  for my uncle's name, I care not who knows it--it is Lesly. Lesly--an  honest and noble name.\"    \"And so it is, I doubt not,\" said the old man; \"but there are three of  the name in the Scottish Guard.\"    \"My uncle's name is Ludovic Lesly,\" said the young man.    \"Of the three Leslys,\" answered the merchant, \"two are called Ludovic.\"    \"They call my kinsman Ludovic with the Scar,\" said Quentin. \"Our family  names are so common in a Scottish house, that, where there is no land in  the case, we always give a to-name [surname].\"    \"A nom de guerre [the war name; formerly taken by French soldiers  on entering the service. Hence a fictitious name assumed for other  purposes.], I suppose you to mean,\" answered his companion; \"and the  man you speak of, we, I think, call Le Balafre, from that scar on his  face--a proper man, and a good soldier. I wish I may be able to help  you to an interview with him, for he belongs to a set of gentlemen whose  duty is strict, and who do not often come out of garrison, unless in the  immediate attendance on the King's person.--And now, young man, answer  me one question. I will wager you are desirous to take service with your  uncle in the Scottish Guard. It is a great thing, if you propose  so; especially as you are very young, and some years' experience is  necessary for the high office which you aim at.\"    \"Perhaps I may have thought on some such thing,\" said Durward,  carelessly; \"but if I did, the fancy is off.\"    \"How so, young man?\" said the Frenchman, something sternly, \"Do you  speak thus of a charge which the most noble of your countrymen feel  themselves emulous to be admitted to?\"    \"I wish them joy of it,\" said Quentin, composedly. \"To speak plain, I  should have liked the service of the French King full well; only, dress  me as fine and feed me as high as you will, I love the open air better  than being shut up in a cage or a swallow's nest yonder, as you call  these same grated pepper boxes. Besides,\" he added, in a lower voice,  \"to speak truth, I love not the Castle when the covin tree bears such  acorns as I see yonder.\"    [The large tree in front of a Scottish castle was sometimes called so.  It is difficult to trace the derivation; but at that distance from the  castle the laird received guests of rank, and thither he conveyed them  on their departure. S.]    \"I guess what you mean,\" said the Frenchman; \"but speak yet more  plainly.\"    \"To speak more plainly, then,\" said the youth, \"there grows a fair oak  some flight shot or so from yonder Castle--and on that oak hangs a man  in a gray jerkin, such as this which I wear.\"    \"Ay and indeed!\" said the man of France--\"Pasques dieu! see what it is  to have youthful eyes! Why, I did see something, but only took it for a  raven among the branches. But the sight is no ways strange, young man;  when the summer fades into autumn, and moonlight nights are long, and  roads become unsafe, you will see a cluster of ten, ay of twenty such  acorns, hanging on that old doddered oak.--But what then?--they are so  many banners displayed to scare knaves; and for each rogue that hangs  there, an honest man may reckon that there is a thief, a traitor, a  robber on the highway, a pilleur and oppressor of the people the fewer  in France. These, young man, are signs of our Sovereign's justice.\"    \"I would have hung them farther from my palace, though, were I King  Louis,\" said the youth. \"In my country, we hang up dead corbies where  living corbies haunt, but not in our gardens or pigeon houses. The very  scent of the carrion--faugh--reached my nostrils at the distance where  we stood.\"    \"If you live to be an honest and loyal servant of your Prince, my good  youth,\" answered the Frenchman, \"you will know there is no perfume to  match the scent of a dead traitor.\"    \"I shall never wish to live till I lose the scent of my nostrils or the  sight of my eyes,\" said the Scot. \"Show me a living traitor, and here  are my hand and my weapon; but when life is out, hatred should not live  longer.--But here, I fancy, we come upon the village, where I hope to  show you that neither ducking nor disgust have spoiled mine appetite for  my breakfast. So my good friend, to the hostelrie, with all the speed  you may.--Yet, ere I accept of your hospitality, let me know by what  name to call you.\"    \"Men call me Maitre Pierre,\" answered his companion. \"I deal in  no titles. A plain man, that can live on mine own good--that is my  designation.\"    \"So be it, Maitre Pierre,\" said Quentin, \"and I am happy my good chance  has thrown us together; for I want a word of seasonable advice, and can  be thankful for it.\"    While they spoke thus, the tower of the church and a tall wooden  crucifix, rising above the trees, showed that they were at the entrance  of the village.    But Maitre Pierre, deflecting a little from the road, which had now  joined an open and public causeway, said to his companion that the  inn to which he intended to introduce him stood somewhat secluded, and  received only the better sort of travellers.    \"If you mean those who travel with the better filled purses,\" answered  the Scot, \"I am none of the number, and will rather stand my chance of  your flayers on the highway, than of your flayers in the hostelrie.\"    \"Pasques dieu!\" said his guide, \"how cautious your countrymen of  Scotland are! An Englishman, now, throws himself headlong into a tavern,  eats and drinks of the best, and never thinks of the reckoning till his  belly is full. But you forget, Master Quentin, since Quentin is your  name, you forget I owe you a breakfast for the wetting which my mistake  procured you.--It is the penance of my offence towards you.\"    \"In truth,\" said the light hearted young man, \"I had forgot wetting,  offence, and penance, and all. I have walked my clothes dry, or  nearly so, but I will not refuse your offer in kindness; for my dinner  yesterday was a light one, and supper I had none. You seem an old and  respectable burgess, and I see no reason why I should not accept your  courtesy.\"    The Frenchman smiled aside, for he saw plainly that the youth, while he  was probably half famished, had yet some difficulty to reconcile himself  to the thoughts of feeding at a stranger's cost, and was endeavouring  to subdue his inward pride by the reflection, that, in such slight  obligations, the acceptor performed as complaisant a part as he by whom  the courtesy was offered.    In the meanwhile, they descended a narrow lane, overshadowed by tall  elms, at the bottom of which a gateway admitted them into the courtyard  of an inn of unusual magnitude, calculated for the accommodation of the  nobles and suitors who had business at the neighbouring Castle, where  very seldom, and only when such hospitality was altogether unavoidable,  did Louis XI permit any of his court to have apartments. A scutcheon,  bearing the fleur de lys, hung over the principal door of the large  irregular building; but there was about the yard and the offices  little or none of the bustle which in those days, when attendants were  maintained both in public and in private houses, marked that business  was alive, and custom plenty. It seemed as if the stern and unsocial  character of the royal mansion in the neighbourhood had communicated  a portion of its solemn and terrific gloom even to a place designed  according to universal custom elsewhere, for the temple of social  indulgence, merry society, and good cheer.    Maitre Pierre, without calling any one, and even without approaching  the principal entrance, lifted the latch of a side door, and led the  way into a large room, where a faggot was blazing on the hearth, and  arrangements made for a substantial breakfast.    \"My gossip has been careful,\" said the Frenchman to the Scot. \"You must  be cold, and I have commanded a fire; you must be hungry, and you shall  have breakfast presently.\"    He whistled and the landlord entered--answered Maitre Pierre's bon  jour with a reverence--but in no respect showed any part of the prating  humour properly belonging to a French publican of all ages.    \"I expected a gentleman,\" said Maitre Pierre, \"to order breakfast--hath  he done so?\"    In answer the landlord only bowed; and while he continued to bring,  and arrange upon the table, the various articles of a comfortable meal,  omitted to extol their merits by a single word. And yet the breakfast  merited such eulogiums as French hosts are wont to confer upon their  regales, as the reader will be informed in the next chapter.        CHAPTER IV: THE DEJEUNER         Sacred heaven! what masticators! what bread!         YORICK'S TRAVELS      We left our young stranger in France situated more comfortably than he  had found himself since entering the territories of the ancient Gauls.  The breakfast, as we hinted in the conclusion of the last chapter, was  admirable. There was a pate de Perigord, over which a gastronome would  have wished to live and die, like Homer's lotus eaters [see the Odyssey,  chap. ix, where Odysseus arrives at the land of the Lotus eaters:  \"whosoever of them ate the lotus's honeyed fruit resolved to bring  tidings back no more and never to leave the place, but with the Lotus  eaters there desired to stay, to feed on lotus and forget his going  home.\" Palmer's Translation.], forgetful of kin, native country, and all  social obligations whatever. Its vast walls of magnificent crust seemed  raised like the bulwarks of some rich metropolitan city, an emblem of  the wealth which they are designed to protect. There was a delicate  ragout, with just that petit point de l'ail [a little flavor of garlic.  The French is ungrammatical.] which Gascons love, and Scottishmen do  not hate. There was, besides, a delicate ham, which had once supported a  noble wild boar in the neighbouring wood of Mountrichart. There was the  most exquisite white bread, made into little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#8)"],[1,"ies, the generation of Danavas and Yakshas of  great prowess, and serpents, Gandharvas, birds, and of all creatures; and  lastly, of the life and adventures of king Bharata--the progenitor of the  line that goes by his name--the son born of Sakuntala in the hermitage of  the ascetic Kanwa. This parva also describes the greatness of Bhagirathi,  and the births of the Vasus in the house of Santanu and their ascension to  heaven. In this parva is also narrated the birth of Bhishma uniting in  himself portions of the energies of the other Vasus, his renunciation of  royalty and adoption of the Brahmacharya mode of life, his adherence to  his vows, his protection of Chitrangada, and after the death of  Chitrangada, his protection of his younger brother, Vichitravirya, and his  placing the latter on the throne: the birth of Dharma among men in  consequence of the curse of Animondavya; the births of Dhritarashtra and  Pandu through the potency of Vyasa's blessings (?) and also the birth of  the Pandavas; the plottings of Duryodhana to send the sons of Pandu to  Varanavata, and the other dark counsels of the sons of Dhritarashtra in  regard to the Pandavas; then the advice administered to Yudhishthira on  his way by that well-wisher of the Pandavas--Vidura--in the mlechchha  language--the digging of the hole, the burning of Purochana and the  sleeping woman of the fowler caste, with her five sons, in the house of  lac; the meeting of the Pandavas in the dreadful forest with Hidimba, and  the slaying of her brother Hidimba by Bhima of great prowess. The birth of  Ghatotkacha; the meeting of the Pandavas with Vyasa and in accordance with  his advice their stay in disguise in the house of a Brahmana in the city  of Ekachakra; the destruction of the Asura Vaka, and the amazement of the  populace at the sight; the extra-ordinary births of Krishna and  Dhrishtadyumna; the departure of the Pandavas for Panchala in obedience to  the injunction of Vyasa, and moved equally by the desire of winning the  hand of Draupadi on learning the tidings of the Swayamvara from the lips  of a Brahmana; victory of Arjuna over a Gandharva, called Angaraparna, on  the banks of the Bhagirathi, his contraction of friendship with his  adversary, and his hearing from the Gandharva the history of Tapati,  Vasishtha and Aurva. This parva treats of the journey of the Pandavas  towards Panchala, the acquisition of Draupadi in the midst of all the  Rajas, by Arjuna, after having successfully pierced the mark; and in the  ensuing fight, the defeat of Salya, Karna, and all the other crowned heads  at the hands of Bhima and Arjuna of great prowess; the ascertainment by  Balarama and Krishna, at the sight of these matchless exploits, that the  heroes were the Pandavas, and the arrival of the brothers at the house of  the potter where the Pandavas were staying; the dejection of Drupada on  learning that Draupadi was to be wedded to five husbands; the wonderful  story of the five Indras related in consequence; the extraordinary and  divinely-ordained wedding of Draupadi; the sending of Vidura by the sons  of Dhritarashtra as envoy to the Pandavas; the arrival of Vidura and his  sight to Krishna; the abode of the Pandavas in Khandava-prastha, and then  their rule over one half of the kingdom; the fixing of turns by the sons  of Pandu, in obedience to the injunction of Narada, for connubial  companionship with Krishna. In like manner hath the history of Sunda and  Upasunda been recited in this. This parva then treats of the departure of  Arjuna for the forest according to the vow, he having seen Draupadi and  Yudhishthira sitting together as he entered the chamber to take out arms  for delivering the kine of a certain Brahmana. This parva then describes  Arjuna's meeting on the way with Ulupi, the daughter of a Naga (serpent);  it then relates his visits to several sacred spots; the birth of  Vabhruvahana; the deliverance by Arjuna of the five celestial damsels who  had been turned into alligators by the imprecation of a Brahmana, the  meeting of Madhava and Arjuna on the holy spot called Prabhasa; the  carrying away of Subhadra by Arjuna, incited thereto by her brother  Krishna, in the wonderful car moving on land and water, and through mid-  air, according to the wish of the rider; the departure for Indraprastha,  with the dower; the conception in the womb of Subhadra of that prodigy of  prowess, Abhimanyu; Yajnaseni's giving birth to children; then follows the  pleasure-trip of Krishna and Arjuna to the banks of the Jamuna and the  acquisition by them of the discus and the celebrated bow Gandiva; the  burning of the forest of Khandava; the rescue of Maya by Arjuna, and the  escape of the serpent,--and the begetting of a son by that best of Rishis,  Mandapala, in the womb of the bird Sarngi. This parva is divided by Vyasa  into two hundred and twenty-seven chapters. These two hundred and twenty-  seven chapters contain eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-four slokas.    \"The second is the extensive parva called Sabha or the assembly, full of  matter. The subjects of this parva are the establishment of the grand hall  by the Pandavas; their review of their retainers; the description of the  lokapalas by Narada well-acquainted with the celestial regions; the  preparations for the Rajasuya sacrifice; the destruction of Jarasandha;  the deliverance by Vasudeva of the princes confined in the mountain-pass;  the campaign of universal conquest by the Pandavas; the arrival of the  princes at the Rajasuya sacrifice with tribute; the destruction of  Sisupala on the occasion of the sacrifice, in connection with offering of  arghya; Bhimasena's ridicule of Duryodhana in the assembly; Duryodhana's  sorrow and envy at the sight of the magnificent scale on which the  arrangements had been made; the indignation of Duryodhana in consequence,  and the preparations for the game of dice; the defeat of Yudhishthira at  play by the wily Sakuni; the deliverance by Dhritarashtra of his afflicted  daughter-in-law Draupadi plunged in the sea of distress caused by the  gambling, as of a boat tossed about by the tempestuous waves. The  endeavours of Duryodhana to engage Yudhishthira again in the game; and the  exile of the defeated Yudhishthira with his brothers. These constitute  what has been called by the great Vyasa the Sabha Parva. This parva is  divided into seventh-eight sections, O best of Brahmanas, of two thousand,  five hundred and seven slokas.    \"Then comes the third parva called Aranyaka (relating to the forest). This  parva treats of the wending of the Pandavas to the forest and the citizens  following the wise Yudhishthira, Yudhishthira's adoration of the god of  day, according to the injunctions of Dhaumya, to be gifted with the power  of maintaining the dependent Brahmanas with food and drink: the creation  of food through the grace of the Sun: the expulsion by Dhritarashtra of  Vidura who always spoke for his master's good; Vidura's coming to the  Pandavas and his return to Dhritarashtra at the solicitation of the latter;  the wicked Duryodhana's plottings to destroy the forest-ranging Pandavas,  being incited thereto by Karna; the appearance of Vyasa and his dissuasion  of Duryodhana bent on going to the forest; the history of Surabhi; the  arrival of Maitreya; his laying down to Dhritarashtra the course of action;  and his curse on Duryodhana; Bhima's slaying of Kirmira in battle; the  coming of the Panchalas and the princes of the Vrishni race to  Yudhishthira on hearing of his defeat at the unfair gambling by Sakuni;  Dhananjaya's allaying the wrath of Krishna; Draupadi's lamentations before  Madhava; Krishna's cheering her; the fall of Sauva also has been here  described by the Rishi; also Krishna's bringing Subhadra with her son to  Dwaraka; and Dhrishtadyumna's bringing the son of Draupadi to Panchala;  the entrance of the sons of Pandu into the romantic Dwaita wood;  conversation of Bhima, Yudhishthira, and Draupadi; the coming of Vyasa to  the Pandavas and his endowing Yudhishthira with the power of Pratismriti;  then, after the departure of Vyasa, the removal of the Pandavas to the  forest of Kamyaka; the wanderings of Arjuna of immeasurable prowess in  search of weapons; his battle with Mahadeva in the guise of a hunter; his  meeting with the lokapalas and receipt of weapons from them; his journey  to the regions of Indra for arms and the consequent anxiety of  Dhritarashtra; the wailings and lamentations of Yudhishthira on the  occasion of his meeting with the worshipful great sage Brihadaswa. Here  occurs the holy and highly pathetic story of Nala illustrating the  patience of Damayanti and the character of Nala. Then the acquirement by  Yudhishthira of the mysteries of dice from the same great sage; then the  arrival of the Rishi Lomasa from the heavens to where the Pandavas were,  and the receipt by these high-souled dwellers in the woods of the  intelligence brought by the Rishi of their brother Arjuna staying in the  heavens; then the pilgrimage of the Pandavas to various sacred spots in  accordance with the message of Arjuna, and their attainment of great merit  and virtue consequent on such pilgrimage; then the pilgrimage of the great  sage Narada to the shrine Putasta; also the pilgrimage of the high-souled  Pandavas. Here is the deprivation of Karna of his ear-rings by Indra. Here  also is recited the sacrificial magnificence of Gaya; then the story of  Agastya in which the Rishi ate up the Asura Vatapi, and his connubial  connection with Lopamudra from the desire of offspring. Then the story of  Rishyasringa who adopted Brahmacharya mode of life from his very boyhood;  then the history of Rama of great prowess, the son of Jamadagni, in which  has been narrated the death of Kartavirya and the Haihayas; then the  meeting between the Pandavas and the Vrishnis in the sacred spot called  Prabhasa; then the story of Sukanya in which Chyavana,"]]]
